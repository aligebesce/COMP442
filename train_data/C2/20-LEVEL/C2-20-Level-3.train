Alright.

You know what I mean?
"The what, pardon?"
"The actual water heater, the re-flueing of it."
Oh!
Oh!
"You know, the, the"
The gas people.
"it's  yeah the gas council and all, like, these new bloody laws they've bought in like!"
That's right.
Mm.
That's why you can see they've all had them
Yeah.
"they've had to extend the pipes  all this and that like, you know?"
Yeah.
But it's down to be getting moved.
You know what I mean?
"But that's all it is, because it's in a confined space  and with a shower going they're worried about fumes and all like, you know, the carbon monoxide, like, you know?"
Mm.
Yeah.
"But er  put it this way, I've been on courses, like I wouldn't  I use it."
You know what I mean?
Mm.
"Cos er  like I say, if I'd had a window open or so you know what I mean?"
That's right..
And all  if it's a little nippy you .
is it?
"But I said, that they've been in bathrooms for years like!"
You know they  and smaller bathrooms than that like!
"Oh, well I don't know what to do!"
Picked three jacks up hoping there'd be a joker.
Oh you awkward sod.
Picking up what .
Well I ain't.
She's slinging everything I wa want and can't get nothing.
Picked it up.
Just picked a joker up.

Well look at that bugger.
She's putting all my buggers I want.
Last card.
Little demon.
"Come on, your last chance now for your uncle John."
Wondering what to chuck you John.
"So it should be a good laugh like a good old er, jolly jaunt!"
But we'll have to have a look.
Right!
I will let you go then.
"And I lost the bet by the way, cos I said to da , Andy, I bet you fifty P it was for my brother, and it wasn't."
So
Oh I'm rich!

"So, I'll basically see you tomorrow."
Okay.

Well there's not a great deal to talk about.

"Well, we'll see  er  hardly think  that I know any  active"
Well you
Admirals at the moment.
"Well not active, but you do go down to Portsmouth quite regularly don't you?"
"Well yeah, I mean I might  I can probably get more advice on the R A F or Army  than, than the Navy."
Can you find out for the Army for me?
Mm mm mm.
And
That's alright.
Good!
Pardon.
Good.
What time is Matthew gonna leave?
Dunno.
Presumably he's telling the girls today is he?
Something?
Yes.
Is that to put this in?
"Er, well I'm not sure."
I haven't made the sponge yet.
"Yeah, I think it's"
"Well I'll , I'll put it in this one because if  it will half smell"
"Well I'm just trying ,co cos the cheese has got to go in there as well."
I know.
Just to make sure they haven't gone off.
Well if that's gone off then you just have to
"Well it hasn't, but"
No it would
but that one's gone
It
off.
Yeah.
"So you put, you, that ones alright so you put it in there."
Okay.
Then you do another one and put that in there.
Alright then.
Heat the oil and fry the onion and garlic until soft but not browned.
Add the butter and bacon and fry until crisp.
Add the  and simmer
Right.
"No,"

Go and see the  if you wanted them.
Well I can for two hours mum.
Mm?

"Those are done properly, not just slapped on anyhow!"
Five pound for two hours.
Your cheap then ain't you?
Very nice!
"No, five pound an hour."
Oh.
And whatever time I'll
"Yeah , why not!"
Would you rather have a cup of tea?
"Tell you what  I'll charge you qui , twenty quid for the whole day."
What?
Twenty quid for the whole day.
Oh well  Emma only charged that to do the lounge!
I know.
And that was wallpapering that was!
"I know, I'm gonna paper."
Cos I'm hard up for money mum!
Do you want a cup of tea as well?
Mhm.
There's only four of us isn't there?
Mm.
Does dad want one?
Yeah.
I'll go and look for some wallpaper .
Got enough there ain't you?
No.
Probably be alright to use the hot water system but not the heating.
Oh right.
Because it's a pressurized system.
So if you have a look and you can't see that needle.
Yeah.
"The, the water is  the water pressure's definitely changed."
Well it's changed now cos it's up now.
I in the shower in the shower  for one.
It's up now.
I it's weak in the shower.
Er well it would have been.
There was no pressure on it.
"No, it's always weak."
It's always weak in the shower now.
Mm?
It's never as strong as it used to be.
It shouldn't be.
It should be okay.
And it's cold as well.
Have you noticed?
"Yeah I was  I had a shower, well, perhaps the water's been turned down a bit."
I I keep turning it up again but it it's cold every time I use it.
You know I pull it out and turn it up hot.
No I mean here.
Oh there.
On the boiler.
That water.
Rick.
It's only one and a half.
It should be higher than that.
I'll put it up to two and a half and it should be warm enough there.
Right.
Mum!
"said, well look I said, I don't wanna know"
Hold on!

"I said, is this he , water heater gonna be ?"
I don't know!
"I, oh it's alright, she said it's in the bathroom?"
I said yeah.
"She said well  he knows about it, it's all in hand!"
Well
Well I
"that's no good to me, like!"
No!
No it's
He said he'd be one of the first.
He's putting the flues on and he hasn't come down to check it so if he's down here I'm gonna bloody tell him.
pipes like that
Yeah.
Oh.
And still they've condemned it.
"Yes, it's surely their van."
And other flues all down along there.
Mm.
All on the grass see?
It's coming out of here.
"This bloke, he said."
One of them goes round putting the chimneys on and the other checks the flue.
Oh.
So I'll tell him that the fire will be on.
Mm.
There's some in the van there.
They're pretty good ones aren't they?
to this.
"Yeah it's big enough for one but it isn't it big enough for two, that's the one we went to see."
"Paul live in one of them  well, did."
That's the one we went to see.
Look lovely.
Yeah but
"pay it all, but"
It's only got a bed in the bedroom you
No erm

They'd only paid fifty five quid.
"Open the door and ju open the door, and jump"
Helen.
on the bed.
What?
"You only paid fifty five quid, but I can't afford ."
"Didn't see me, did you?"
"Just open the door and jump on the bed, if you want to put a bed in."
No I should think it would be
No you open the door and
No I know  no it's it's alright for one
It's big for one though.
but not for two  I mean me and Stuart
"not exactly little are we,."
We had a look.
work .
"I know well it's not your  don't wanna open the door and  can't open the door properly cos the bed's there,one step and you're on the bed."
Leave it Ricky!
No!
"Ricky, I'll belt you one!"
today.
Eh?
It was just a clipping of it.
"It had  it sor it was sort of like the Body Shop sort of theme, but it's not the Body theme."
"It  you know th , their green symbol with the black"
Yeah.
in it?
"Well it's green and it's got cream in it, but it's not the exact symbol of the Body Shop,i a bit different."
It's weird!
It's just really puzzling me!
I don't know what it is.
.
Oh they're recording us.
What's it for ?
What?
You wanna put it on the table where it's  actually.
"Right, just put it on the table and leave it!"
No you can't.
"I'll put it on the table, then leave it!"
If I had what?
What behind?
Yeah.
So there you'll pass all round.
Oh nice!
I thought I'd do a tape then mum.
Not gonna be
Okay?
worth going out.
You get endorsement!
Have they ?
Oh I went like hell then didn't I?
At least they've gone light and we can hammer along.
I didn't think you could.
No!
Shift up then!
"Can't see   No I, I didn't  I didn't probe him  I said what about the money though?"
Well  what a  well I said  you are a gentleman of the land  well he said I haven't got a lot of money.
Well I said how would ?
Well  well I said nor do I.
I said we've had so much
aggro  I said  no money  no cars!you'll get a car    I said I know you will he said!
Call the police in.
Oh well I ain't bothered!
I'm afraid she was rude to us!
And I said as well I said
We put up a lot with him!
I'll go to court.
Oh!
I said on what    well he said it's gotta be   well  cos Maggie  said it's too late  I said no
"you can have it, he said that's   I said yes"
Yeah.
on two wheels!
That's right.
Not on
So
he won't!
"I said if you're going to court Neil  and if that ain't paid, I said there's  Beth can manage  they   and they paid us out."
So what are you trying to say then?
I said you're gonna have yo have gone to Cornwall.
Oh no he's not!
And put the miles on the clocks.
"That's ve , that's all very well"
Well you might as well save him his   and if he has got the car he's gonna hammer it cos he don't
Course he does.
at all.
Yeah  he'd have probably blown the bloody thing up!
Yeah.
And keep it going.
I mean I used to love me bingo.
"I mean once upon a time nothing was , but I've spent  two and a half thousand pound if not more since I've been off work."
Yeah.
"You know, the dole don't keep us."
Well no.
I mean it's
There's no way I mean
No.
you can't live on the dole.
Not when you buy like I buy.
No.
No.
I mean your joint of meat costs you a fiver don't it?
Course it does.
Oh aye course it does yeah.
So I mean we're
And the rest sometimes.
I went
Well
I went down town  yesterday and got some braising steak and it cost me five pounds sixty.
I know.
It's crazy.
And that's just for three of them.
"I mean I, four of them."
I don't eat it you see.
"That's without your  and that's without your bits to go with it, your veg."
That's right yeah.
And then cooking it.
I mean
I know.
"And as a result I mean to stay a week at Plainfield and come to see you every day , if you will let me ."
"And on my way back to the Bar N I mean to stop off at Plainfield again for another week , and then I shall tell you something more -- something it would be a little too bold to say now , perhaps , although I could say it just as well and truly ."
All this if I may .
"May I , Sidney ? ''"
He bent forward and looked earnestly into her face .
"Sidney felt a new , curious , inexplicable thrill at her heart ."
"`` Oh , yes ."
"-- I suppose so , '' she said shyly ."
"`` Now , take me up to the house and introduce me to your Aunt Jane , '' said John Lincoln in satisfied tone ."
An Adventure on Island Rock `` Who was the man I saw talking to you in the hayfield ? ''
"asked Aunt Kate , as Uncle Richard came to dinner ."
"`` Bob Marks , '' said Uncle Richard briefly ."
`` I 've sold Laddie to him . ''
"Ernest Hughes , the twelve-year-old orphan boy whom Uncle `` boarded and kept '' for the chores he did , suddenly stopped eating ."
"`` Oh , Mr. Lawson , you 're not going to sell Laddie ? ''"
he cried chokily .
Uncle Richard stared at him .
"Never before , in the five years that Ernest had lived with him , had the quiet little fellow spoken without being spoken to , much less ventured to protest against anything Uncle Richard might do ."
"`` Certainly I am , '' answered the latter curtly ."
"`` Bob offered me twenty dollars for the dog , and he 's coming after him next week . ''"
"`` Oh , Mr. Lawson , '' said Ernest , rising to his feet , his small , freckled face crimson ."
"`` Oh , do n't sell Laddie !"
"Please , Mr. Lawson , do n't sell him ! ''"
`` What nonsense is this ? ''
said Uncle Richard sharply .
"He was a man who brooked no opposition from anybody , and who never changed his mind when it was once made up ."
`` Do n't sell Laddie ! ''
pleaded Ernest miserably .
`` He is the only friend I 've got .
I ca n't live if Laddie goes away .
"Oh , do n't sell him , Mr. Lawson ! ''"
"`` Sit down and hold your tongue , '' said Uncle Richard sternly ."
`` Mollie !
Mollie !
After that kiss !
"Fie , fie ! ''"
"`` You are very absurd , '' said Mollie , `` But your absurdity has been amusing ."
"I have -- yes , positively -- I have enjoyed your Eden comedy ."
But now you must not come any further with me .
My aunt might not approve .
Here is my path to Orchard Knob farmhouse .
"There , I presume , is yours to Sweetbriar Cottage ."
Good morning . ''
"`` I am coming over to see you this afternoon , '' said Murray coolly ."
`` But you need n't be afraid .
I will not tell tales out of Eden .
I will be a hypocrite and pretend to Mrs. Palmer that we have never met before .
But you and I will know and remember .
"Now , you may go ."
I reserve to myself the privilege of standing here and watching you out of sight . ''
"* * * * * That afternoon Murray strolled over to Orchard Knob , going into the kitchen without knocking as was the habit in that free and easy world ."
"Mrs. Palmer was lying on the lounge with a pungent handkerchief bound about her head , but keeping a vigilant eye on a very pretty , very plump brown-eyed girl who was stirring a kettleful of cherry preserve on the range ."
"`` Good afternoon , Mrs. Palmer , '' said Murray , wondering where Mollie was ."
`` I 'm sorry to see that you look something like an invalid . ''
"`` I 've a raging , ramping headache , '' said Mrs. Palmer solemnly ."
`` I had it all night and I 'm good for nothing .
"Mollie , you 'd better take them cherries off ."
"Mr. Murray , this is my niece , Mollie Booth . ''"
`` What ? ''
said Murray explosively .
"`` Miss Mollie Booth , '' repeated Mrs. Palmer in a louder tone ."
Murray regained outward self-control and bowed to the blushing Mollie .
`` And what about Eve ? ''
he thought helplessly .
"`` Marry but the man I name to you , and he shall be my lord , and you my lady , before night ."
"For Sir Richard , let me tell you plainly , he will die Sir Richard . ''"
"`` I ask no more of Heaven , my lord , than but to die Sir Richard 's wife , '' returned Joanna ."
"`` Look ye at that , my lord , '' said Gloucester , turning to Lord Foxham ."
`` Here be a pair for you .
"The lad , when for good services I gave him his choice of my favour , chose but the grace of an old , drunken shipman ."
"I did warn him freely , but he was stout in his besottedness ."
"` Here dieth your favour , ' said I ; and he , my lord , with a most assured impertinence , ` Mine be the loss , ' quoth he ."
"It shall be so , by the rood ! ''"
`` Said he so ? ''
cried Alicia .
"`` Then well said , lion-driver ! ''"
`` Who is this ? ''
asked the duke .
"`` A prisoner of Sir Richard 's , '' answered Lord Foxham ; `` Mistress Alicia Risingham . ''"
"`` See that she be married to a sure man , '' said the duke ."
"`` I had thought of my kinsman , Hamley , an it like your grace , '' returned Lord Foxham ."
`` He hath well served the cause . ''
"`` It likes me well , '' said Richard ."
`` Let them be wedded speedily .
"Say , fair maid , will you wed ? ''"
"`` My lord duke , '' said Alicia , `` so as the man is straight '' -- And there , in a perfect consternation , the voice died on her tongue ."
"`` He is straight , my mistress , '' replied Richard , calmly ."
`` I am the only crookback of my party ; we are else passably well shapen .
"Ladies , and you , my lord , '' he added , with a sudden change to grave courtesy , `` judge me not too churlish if I leave you ."
"A captain , in the time of war , hath not the ordering of his hours . ''"
"And with a very handsome salutation he passed on , followed by his officers ."
"`` Alack , '' cried Alicia , `` I am shent ! ''"
"`` Ye know him not , '' replied Lord Foxham ."
`` It is but a trifle ; he hath already clean forgot your words . ''
"`` He is , then , the very flower of knighthood , '' said Alicia ."
"`` Nay , he but mindeth other things , '' returned Lord Foxham ."
"`` Then follow the leader , '' he cried gaily ."
"`` Mind you , I am not sure that we have a drawing-room , but we pretend we have , and it 's all the same ."
Hoop la ! ''
"He went off dancing through the house , and they all cried `` Hoop la ! ''"
"and danced after him , searching for the drawing-room ; and I forget whether they found it , but at any rate they found corners , and they all fitted in ."
"As for Peter , he saw Wendy once again before he flew away ."
"He did not exactly come to the window , but he brushed against it in passing so that she could open it if she liked and call to him ."
That is what she did .
"`` Hullo , Wendy , good-bye , '' he said ."
"`` Oh dear , are you going away ? ''"
`` Yes . ''
"`` You do n't feel , Peter , '' she said falteringly , `` that you would like to say anything to my parents about a very sweet subject ? ''"
`` No . ''
"`` About me , Peter ? ''"
`` No . ''
"Mrs. Darling came to the window , for at present she was keeping a sharp eye on Wendy ."
"She told Peter that she had adopted all the other boys , and would like to adopt him also ."
`` Would you send me to school ? ''
he inquired craftily .
`` Yes . ''
`` And then to an office ? ''
`` I suppose so . ''
`` Soon I would be a man ? ''
`` Very soon . ''
"`` I do n't want to go to school and learn solemn things , '' he told her passionately ."
`` I do n't want to be a man .
"O Wendy 's mother , if I was to wake up and feel there was a beard ! ''"
"`` Peter , '' said Wendy the comforter , `` I should love you in a beard ; '' and Mrs. Darling stretched out her arms to him , but he repulsed her ."
"`` Keep back , lady , no one is going to catch me and make me a man . ''"
`` But where are you going to live ? ''
`` With Tink in the house we built for Wendy .
The fairies are to put it high up among the tree tops where they sleep at nights . ''
-- he said he never had any Christmas or New Year at all . ''
`` Poor little fellow ! ''
said the doctor .
"`` I 've heard of him ; a pretty hard time he has of it , I think . ''"
"`` He was so pretty , Papa ."
And Edie gave him her blue mittens for William John . ''
`` The plot deepens .
Who is William John ? ''
"`` Oh , a cousin or something , did n't he say Edie ?"
"Anyway , he is sick , and he wanted to go coasting , and Bertie gave him his mittens ."
And I suppose he never had any Christmas either . ''
"`` There are plenty who have n't , '' said the doctor , taking up his paper with a sigh ."
"`` Well , girlies , you seem interested in this little fellow so , if you like , you may invite him and his cousin to take dinner with you on New Year 's night . ''"
"`` Oh , Papa ! ''"
"said Edith , her eyes shining like stars ."
The doctor laughed .
"`` Write him a nice little note of invitation -- you are the lady of the house , you know -- and I 'll see that he gets it tomorrow . ''"
And this was how it came to pass that Bertie received the next day his first invitation to dine out .
"He read the little note through three times in order fully to take in its contents , and then went around the rest of the day in deep abstraction as though he was trying to decide some very important question ."
It was with the same expression that he opened the door at home in the evening .
His aunt was stirring some oatmeal mush on the stove .
"`` Is that you , Bert ? ''"
She spoke sharply .
"She always spoke sharply , even when not intending it ; it had grown to be a habit ."
"`` Yes 'm , '' said Bertie meekly , as he hung up his cap ."
"`` I s ` pose you 've only got one day more at the store , '' said Mrs. Ross ."
"`` Sampson did n't say anything about keeping you longer , did he ? ''"
`` No .
He said he could n't -- I asked him . ''
"`` Well , I did n't expect he would ."
You 'll have a holiday on New Year 's anyhow ; whether you 'll have anything to eat or not is a different question . ''
"`` I 've an invitation to dinner , '' said Bertie timidly , `` me and William John ."
I could n't look Catherine in the face when she came home .
I 'm so ashamed of myself and I never meant to be so false .
We must never let her suspect for a minute . ''
"`` It 's pretty rough on a fellow , '' said another voice -- Ned 's voice -- in a choked sort of a way ."
"`` Upon my word , Edith , I do n't see how I 'm going to keep it up . ''"
"`` You must , '' sobbed Edith ."
`` It would break her heart -- and Sidney 's too .
"We must just make up our minds to forget each other , Ned , and you must marry Katherine . ''"
Just at this point Katherine became aware that she was eavesdropping and she went away noiselessly .
"She did not look in the least like a person who has received a mortal blow , and she had forgotten her headache altogether ."
"When Edith came up half an hour later , she found the worn-out invalid sitting up and reading a novel ."
"`` How is your headache , dear ? ''"
"she asked , carefully keeping her face turned away from Katherine ."
"`` Oh , it 's all gone , '' said Miss Rangely cheerfully ."
`` Why did n't you come down then ?
Ned was here . ''
"`` Well , Ede , I did go down , but I thought I was n't particularly wanted , so I came back . ''"
"Edith faced her friend in dismay , forgetful of swollen lids and tear-stained cheeks ."
`` Katherine ! ''
"`` Do n't look so conscience stricken , my dear child ."
There is no harm done . ''
`` You heard -- '' `` Some surprising speeches .
So you and Ned have gone and fallen in love with one another ? ''
"`` Oh , Katherine , '' sobbed Edith , `` we -- we -- could n't help it -- but it 's all over ."
"Oh , do n't be angry with me ! ''"
`` Angry ?
"My dear , I 'm delighted . ''"
`` Delighted ? ''
"`` Yes , you dear goose ."
"Ca n't you guess , or must I tell you ?"
"Sidney and I did the very same , and had just such a melancholy parting last night as I suspect you and Ned had tonight . ''"
`` Katherine ! ''
Murray captured a milking stool and rounded up another Jersey .
Before sitting down he seemed struck with an idea .
`` My name is Arnold Murray .
"I board at Sweetbriar Cottage , next farm to Orchard Knob ."
That makes us near neighbours . ''
"`` I suppose it does , '' said Mollie ."
Murray mentally decided that her voice was the sweetest he had ever heard .
He was glad he had arranged his cow at such an angle that he could study her profile .
It was amazing that Mrs. Palmer 's niece should have such a profile .
It looked as if centuries of fine breeding were responsible for it .
`` What a morning ! ''
he said enthusiastically .
`` It harks back to the days when earth was young .
They must have had just such mornings as this in Eden . ''
`` Do you always get up so early ? ''
asked Mollie practically .
"`` Always , '' said Murray without a blush ."
"Then -- `` But no , that is a fib , and I can not tell fibs to you ."
The truth is your tribute .
I never get up early .
It was fate that roused me and brought me here this morning .
"The morning is a miracle -- and you , I might suppose you were born of the sunrise , if Mrs. Palmer had n't told me all about you . ''"
`` What did she tell you about me ? ''
"asked Mollie , changing cows ."
Murray discovered that she was tall and that the big blue print apron shrouded a singularly graceful figure .
`` She said you were the best-looking girl in Bruce county .
"I have seen very few of the girls in Bruce county , but I know she is right . ''"
"`` That compliment is not nearly so pretty as the sunrise one , '' said Mollie reflectively ."
"`` Mrs. Palmer has told me things about you , '' she added ."
"`` Curiosity knows no gender , '' hinted Murray ."
`` She said you were good-looking and lazy and different from other people . ''
"`` All compliments , '' said Murray in a gratified tone ."
Wendy and John had been taken aback somewhat at finding their father in the kennel .
"`` Surely , '' said John , like one who had lost faith in his memory , `` he used not to sleep in the kennel ? ''"
"`` John , '' Wendy said falteringly , `` perhaps we do n't remember the old life as well as we thought we did . ''"
A chill fell upon them ; and serve them right .
"`` It is very careless of mother , '' said that young scoundrel John , `` not to be here when we come back . ''"
It was then that Mrs. Darling began playing again .
`` It 's mother ! ''
"cried Wendy , peeping ."
`` So it is ! ''
said John .
"`` Then are you not really our mother , Wendy ? ''"
"asked Michael , who was surely sleepy ."
`` Oh dear ! ''
"exclaimed Wendy , with her first real twinge of remorse -LSB- for having gone -RSB- , `` it was quite time we came back . ''"
"`` Let us creep in , '' John suggested , `` and put our hands over her eyes . ''"
"But Wendy , who saw that they must break the joyous news more gently , had a better plan ."
"`` Let us all slip into our beds , and be there when she comes in , just as if we had never been away . ''"
"And so when Mrs. Darling went back to the night-nursery to see if her husband was asleep , all the beds were occupied ."
"The children waited for her cry of joy , but it did not come ."
"She saw them , but she did not believe they were there ."
"You see , she saw them in their beds so often in her dreams that she thought this was just the dream hanging around her still ."
"She sat down in the chair by the fire , where in the old days she had nursed them ."
"They could not understand this , and a cold fear fell upon all the three of them ."
`` Mother ! ''
Wendy cried .
"`` That 's Wendy , '' she said , but still she was sure it was the dream ."
`` Mother ! ''
"`` That 's John , '' she said ."
`` Mother ! ''
cried Michael .
He knew her now .
"`` That 's Michael , '' she said , and she stretched out her arms for the three little selfish children they would never envelop again ."
The loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him .
It is the fairy language .
"You ordinary children can never hear it , but if you were to hear it you would know that you had heard it once before ."
Tink said that the shadow was in the big box .
"She meant the chest of drawers , and Peter jumped at the drawers , scattering their contents to the floor with both hands , as kings toss ha ` pence to the crowd ."
"In a moment he had recovered his shadow , and in his delight he forgot that he had shut Tinker Bell up in the drawer ."
"If he thought at all , but I do n't believe he ever thought , it was that he and his shadow , when brought near each other , would join like drops of water ; and when they did not he was appalled ."
"He tried to stick it on with soap from the bathroom , but that also failed ."
"A shudder passed through Peter , and he sat on the floor and cried ."
"His sobs woke Wendy , and she sat up in bed ."
She was not alarmed to see a stranger crying on the nursery floor ; she was only pleasantly interested .
"` Boy , ' she said courteously , ` why are you crying ? '"
"Peter could be exceedingly polite also , having learned the grand manner at fairy ceremonies , and he rose and bowed to her beautifully ."
"She was much pleased , and bowed beautifully to him from the bed ."
` What 's your name ? '
he asked .
"` Wendy Moira Angela Darling , ' she replied with some satisfaction ."
` What is your name ? '
` Peter Pan . '
"She was already sure that he must be Peter , but it did seem a comparatively short name ."
` Is that all ? '
"` Yes , ' he said rather sharply ."
He felt for the first time that it was a shortish name .
"` I 'm so sorry , ' said Wendy Moira Angela ."
"` It does n't matter , ' Peter gulped ."
She asked where he lived .
"` Second to the right , ' said Peter , ` and then straight on till morning . '"
` What a funny address ! '
Peter had a sinking .
For the first time he felt that perhaps it was a funny address .
"` No , it is n't , ' he said . '"
"I mean , ' Wendy said nicely , remembering that she was hostess , ` is that what they put on the letters ? '"
"Just when it seemed absolutely finished , ` There 's no knocker on the door , ' he said ."
"They were very ashamed , but Tootles gave the sole of his shoe , and it made an excellent knocker ."
"Absolutely finished now , they thought ."
Not a bit of it .
"` There 's no chimney , ' Peter said ; ` we must have a chimney . '"
"` It certainly does need a chimney , ' said John importantly ."
This gave Peter an idea .
"He snatched the hat off John 's head , knocked out the bottom , and put the hat on the roof ."
"The little house was so pleased to have such a capital chimney that , as if to say thank you , smoke immediately began to come out of the hat ."
Now really and truly it was finished .
Nothing remained to do but to knock .
"` All look your best , ' Peter warned them ; ` first impressions are awfully important . '"
He was glad no one asked him what first impressions are ; they were all too busy looking their best .
"He knocked politely ; and now the wood was as still as the children , not a sound to be heard except from Tinker Bell , who was watching from a branch and openly sneering ."
"What the boys were wondering was , would any one answer the knock ?"
"If a lady , what would she be like ?"
The door opened and a lady came out .
It was Wendy .
They all whipped off their hats .
"She looked properly surprised , and this was just how they had hoped she would look ."
` Where am I ? '
she said .
Of course Slightly was the first to get his word in .
"` Wendy lady , ' he said rapidly , ` for you we built this house . '"
"` Oh , say you 're pleased , ' cried Nibs ."
"` Lovely , darling house , ' Wendy said , and they were the very words they had hoped she would say ."
"` And we are your children , ' cried the twins ."
"Then all went on their knees , and holding out their arms cried , ' O Wendy lady , be our mother . '"
` Ought I ? '
"Wendy said , all shining ."
"` Of course it 's frightfully fascinating , but you see I am only a little girl ."
I have no real experience . '
"`` Isaac Appleby , what do you mean ? ''"
demanded Melissa wrathfully .
Isaac folded his arms and looked up .
"It would be hard to say which face was the more determined , his or the dog 's ."
"But Isaac had the advantage in point of looks , I will say that for him ."
"`` I mean that you two women will stay up on that roof until one of you agrees to marry me , '' said Isaac solemnly ."
I gasped .
"`` Isaac Appleby , you ca n't be in earnest ? ''"
I cried incredulously .
`` You could n't be so mean ? ''
`` I am in earnest .
"I want a wife , and I am going to have one ."
"You two will stay up there , and Julius Caesar here will watch you until one of you makes up her mind to take me ."
"You can settle it between yourselves , and let me know when you have come to a decision . ''"
And with that Isaac walked jauntily into his new house .
`` The man ca n't mean it ! ''
said Melissa .
`` He is trying to play a joke on us . ''
"`` He does mean it , '' I said gloomily ."
`` An Appleby never says anything he does n't mean .
He will keep us here until one of us consents to marry him . ''
"`` It wo n't be me , then , '' said Melissa in a calm sort of rage ."
`` I wo n't marry him if I have to sit on this roof for the rest of my life .
You can take him .
"It 's really you he wants , anyway ; he asked you first . ''"
I always knew that rankled with Melissa .
I thought the situation over before I said anything more .
"We certainly could n't get off that roof , and if we could , there was Julius Caesar ."
"The place was out of sight of every other house in Jersey Cove , and nobody might come near it for a week ."
"To be sure , when Melissa and I did n't turn up the Covites might get out and search for us ; but that would n't be for two or three days anyhow ."
"Melissa had turned her back on me and was sitting with her elbows propped up on her knees , looking gloomily out to sea ."
I was afraid I could n't coax her into marrying Isaac .
I asked .
`` Do ? ''
"said Melissa , snappishly ."
"`` Why , stay here till Isaac Appleby comes out and takes that brute away ?"
What else can we do ? ''
`` What if he is n't at home ? ''
I suggested .
`` We 'll stay here till he comes home .
"Oh , this is a nice predicament ."
This is what comes of cushioning churches ! ''
"`` It might be worse , '' I said comfortingly ."
`` Suppose the roof had n't been flat ? ''
"`` Call Isaac , '' said Melissa shortly ."
"I did n't fancy calling Isaac , but call him I did , and when that failed to bring him Melissa condescended to call , too ; but scream as we might , no Isaac appeared , and that dog sat there and smiled internally ."
"`` It 's no use , '' said Melissa sulkily at last ."
`` Isaac Appleby is dead or away . ''
Half an hour passed ; it seemed as long as a day .
The sun just boiled down on that roof and we were nearly melted .
"We were dreadfully thirsty , and the heat made our heads ache , and I could see my muslin dress fading before my very eyes ."
As for the roses on my best hat -- but that was too harrowing to think about .
Then we saw a welcome sight -- Isaac Appleby coming through the yard with a hoe over his shoulder .
He had probably been working in his field at the back of the house .
I never thought I should have been so glad to see him .
"`` Isaac , oh , Isaac ! ''"
"I called joyfully , leaning over as far as I dared ."
Isaac looked up in amazement at me and Melissa craning our necks over the edge of the roof .
Then he saw the dog and took in the situation .
The creature actually grinned .
"`` Wo n't you call off your dog and let us get down , Isaac ? ''"
I said pleadingly .
Isaac stood and reflected for a moment or two .
"Then he came slowly forward and , before we realized what he was going to do , he took that ladder down and laid it on the ground ."
"But now he knew her ; now , even in that ungainly dress , she smiled upon him , bright with love ; and his heart was transported with joy ."
"`` Sweetheart , '' he said , `` if ye forgive this blunderer , what care I ?"
"Make we direct for Holywood ; there lieth your good guardian and my better friend , Lord Foxham ."
"There shall we be wed ; and whether poor or wealthy , famous or unknown , what , matters it ?"
"This day , dear love , I won my spurs ; I was commended by great men for my valour ; I thought myself the goodliest man of war in all broad England ."
"Then , first , I fell out of my favour with the great ; and now have I been well thrashed , and clean lost my soldiers ."
There was a downfall for conceit !
"But , dear , I care not -- dear , if ye still love me and will wed , I would have my knighthood done away , and mind it not a jot . ''"
`` My Dick ! ''
she cried .
`` And did they knight you ? ''
"`` Ay , dear , ye are my lady now , '' he answered , fondly ; `` or ye shall , ere noon to-morrow -- will ye not ? ''"
"`` That will I , Dick , with a glad heart , '' she answered ."
"`` Ay , sir ?"
Methought ye were to be a monk ! ''
said a voice in their ears .
`` Alicia ! ''
cried Joanna .
"`` Even so , '' replied the young lady , coming forward ."
"`` Alicia , whom ye left for dead , and whom your lion-driver found , and brought to life again , and , by my sooth , made love to , if ye want to know ! ''"
"`` I 'll not believe it , '' cried Joanna ."
`` Dick ! ''
`` Dick ! ''
mimicked Alicia .
"`` Dick , indeed !"
"Ay , fair sir , and ye desert poor damsels in distress , '' she continued , turning to the young knight ."
`` Ye leave them planted behind oaks .
But they say true -- the age of chivalry is dead . ''
"`` Madam , '' cried Dick , in despair , `` upon my soul I had forgotten you outright ."
"Madam , ye must try to pardon me ."
"Ye see , I had new found Joanna ! ''"
"`` I did not suppose that ye had done it o ' purpose , '' she retorted ."
"She is a pretty lady , but not so pretty as my mother ."
"Her mouth is full of thimbles , but not so full as my mother 's was . ''"
Of course he knew nothing whatever about his mother ; but he sometimes bragged about her .
"He did not know the tune , which was `` Home , Sweet Home , '' but he knew it was saying , `` Come back , Wendy , Wendy , Wendy '' ; and he cried exultantly , `` You will never see Wendy again , lady , for the window is barred ! ''"
"He peeped in again to see why the music had stopped , and now he saw that Mrs. Darling had laid her head on the box , and that two tears were sitting on her eyes ."
"`` She wants me to unbar the window , '' thought Peter , `` but I wo n't , not I ! ''"
"He peeped again , and the tears were still there , or another two had taken their place ."
"`` She 's awfully fond of Wendy , '' he said to himself ."
He was angry with her now for not seeing why she could not have Wendy .
The reason was so simple : `` I 'm fond of her too .
"We ca n't both have her , lady . ''"
"But the lady would not make the best of it , and he was unhappy ."
"He ceased to look at her , but even then she would not let go of him ."
"He skipped about and made funny faces , but when he stopped it was just as if she were inside him , knocking ."
"`` Oh , all right , '' he said at last , and gulped ."
Then he unbarred the window .
"`` Come on , Tink , '' he cried , with a frightful sneer at the laws of nature ; `` we do n't want any silly mothers ; '' and he flew away ."
"Thus Wendy and John and Michael found the window open for them after all , which of course was more than they deserved ."
"They alighted on the floor , quite unashamed of themselves , and the youngest one had already forgotten his home ."
"`` John , '' he said , looking around him doubtfully , `` I think I have been here before . ''"
"`` Of course you have , you silly ."
There is your old bed . ''
"`` So it is , '' Michael said , but not with much conviction ."
"`` I say , '' cried John , `` the kennel ! ''"
and he dashed across to look into it .
"`` Perhaps Nana is inside it , '' Wendy said ."
But John whistled .
"`` Hullo , '' he said , `` there 's a man inside it . ''"
`` It 's father ! ''
exclaimed Wendy .
"`` Let me see father , '' Michael begged eagerly , and he took a good look ."
"`` He is not so big as the pirate I killed , '' he said with such frank disappointment that I am glad Mr. Darling was asleep ; it would have been sad if those had been the first words he heard his little Michael say ."
"Donning his hat at its most rakish angle , he wound his cloak around him , holding one end in front as if to conceal his person from the night , of which it was the blackest part , and muttering strangely to himself , stole away through the trees ."
Peter slept on .
"The light guttered -LSB- burned to edges -RSB- and went out , leaving the tenement in darkness ; but still he slept ."
"It must have been not less than ten o'clock by the crocodile , when he suddenly sat up in his bed , wakened by he knew not what ."
It was a soft cautious tapping on the door of his tree .
"Soft and cautious , but in that stillness it was sinister ."
Peter felt for his dagger till his hand gripped it .
Then he spoke .
`` Who is that ? ''
For long there was no answer : then again the knock .
`` Who are you ? ''
No answer .
"He was thrilled , and he loved being thrilled ."
In two strides he reached the door .
"Unlike Slightly 's door , it filled the aperture -LSB- opening -RSB- , so that he could not see beyond it , nor could the one knocking see him ."
"`` I wo n't open unless you speak , '' Peter cried ."
"Then at last the visitor spoke , in a lovely bell-like voice ."
"`` Let me in , Peter . ''"
"It was Tink , and quickly he unbarred to her ."
"She flew in excitedly , her face flushed and her dress stained with mud ."
`` What is it ? ''
"`` Oh , you could never guess ! ''"
"she cried , and offered him three guesses ."
`` Out with it ! ''
"he shouted , and in one ungrammatical sentence , as long as the ribbons that conjurers -LSB- magicians -RSB- pull from their mouths , she told of the capture of Wendy and the boys ."
Peter 's heart bobbed up and down as he listened .
"Wendy bound , and on the pirate ship ; she who loved everything to be just so !"
`` I 'll rescue her ! ''
"he cried , leaping at his weapons ."
As he leapt he thought of something he could do to please her .
He could take his medicine .
His hand closed on the fatal draught .
"Without any waste of words , Alan plunged abruptly into the subject ."
"`` Miss Oliver , why have you avoided me so of late ?"
Have I done anything to offend you ? ''
`` No . ''
"She spoke as if the word hurt her , her eyes persistently cast down ."
`` Then what is the trouble ? ''
There was no answer .
She gave an unvoluntary glance around as if seeking some way of escape .
"There was none , for the spring was set about with thick young firs and Alan blocked the only path ."
He leaned forward and took her hands in his .
"`` Miss Oliver , you must tell me what the trouble is , '' he said firmly ."
"She pulled her hands away and flung them up to her face , her form shaken by stormy sobs ."
In distress he put his arm about her and drew her closer .
"`` Tell me , Lynde , '' he whispered tenderly ."
"She broke away from him , saying passionately , `` You must not come to Four Winds any more ."
You must not have anything more to do with us -- any of us .
We have done you enough harm already .
"But I never thought it could hurt you -- oh , I am sorry , sorry ! ''"
"`` Miss Oliver , I want to see that letter you received the other evening ."
Oh '' -- as she started with surprise -- `` I know about it -- Emily told me .
Who wrote it ? ''
"`` There was no name signed to it , '' she faltered ."
`` Just as I thought .
"Well , you must let me see it . ''"
`` I can not -- I burned it . ''
`` Then tell me what was in it .
You must .
This matter must be cleared up -- I am not going to have our beautiful friendship spoiled by the malice of some coward .
What did that letter say ? ''
`` It said that everybody in your congregation was talking about your frequent visits here -- that it had made a great scandal -- that it was doing you a great deal of injury and would probably end in your having to leave Rexton . ''
"`` That would be a catastrophe indeed , '' said Alan drily ."
"`` Well , what else ? ''"
They discussed the matter at the tea table .
"`` I 'll be glad when the auction is over , '' said Marilla ."
`` It is too much responsibility having so much stock about the place and nobody but that unreliable Martin to look after them .
He has never come back yet and he promised that he would certainly be back last night if I 'd give him the day off to go to his aunt 's funeral .
"I do n't know how many aunts he has got , I am sure ."
That 's the fourth that 's died since he hired here a year ago .
I 'll be more than thankful when the crop is in and Mr. Barry takes over the farm .
"We 'll have to keep Dolly shut up in the pen till Martin comes , for she must be put in the back pasture and the fences there have to be fixed ."
"I declare , it is a world of trouble , as Rachel says ."
Here 's poor Mary Keith dying and what is to become of those two children of hers is more than I know .
"She has a brother in British Columbia and she has written to him about them , but she has n't heard from him yet . ''"
`` What are the children like ?
How old are they ? ''
`` Six past ... they 're twins . ''
"`` Oh , I 've always been especially interested in twins ever since Mrs. Hammond had so many , '' said Anne eagerly ."
`` Are they pretty ? ''
"`` Goodness , you could n't tell ... they were too dirty ."
Davy had been out making mud pies and Dora went out to call him in .
"Davy pushed her headfirst into the biggest pie and then , because she cried , he got into it himself and wallowed in it to show her it was nothing to cry about ."
Mary said Dora was really a very good child but that Davy was full of mischief .
He has never had any bringing up you might say .
His father died when he was a baby and Mary has been sick almost ever since . ''
"`` I 'm always sorry for children that have no bringing up , '' said Anne soberly ."
`` You know I had n't any till you took me in hand .
I hope their uncle will look after them .
Just what relation is Mrs. Keith to you ? ''
`` Mary ?
None in the world .
It was her husband ... he was our third cousin .
There 's Mrs. Lynde coming through the yard .
I thought she 'd be up to hear about Mary . ''
"`` Do n't tell her about Mr. Harrison and the cow , '' implored Anne ."
"But you must not think that Peter Pan was a boy to pity rather than to admire ; if Maimie began by thinking this , she soon found she was very much mistaken ."
"Her eyes glistened with admiration when he told her of his adventures , especially of how he went to and fro between the island and the Gardens in the Thrush 's Nest ."
` How romantic ! '
"Maimie exclaimed , but this was another unknown word , and he hung his head thinking she was despising him . '"
I suppose Tony would not have done that ? '
he said very humbly .
"` Never , never ! '"
"she answered with conviction , ` he would have been afraid . '"
` What is afraid ? '
asked Peter longingly .
He thought it must be some splendid thing . '
"I do wish you would teach me how to be afraid , Maimie , ' he said . '"
"I believe no one could teach that to you , ' she answered adoringly , but Peter thought she meant that he was stupid ."
"She had told him about Tony and of the wicked thing she did in the dark to frighten him -LRB- she knew quite well that it was wicked -RRB- , but Peter misunderstood her meaning and said , ` Oh , how I wish I was as brave as Tony ! '"
It quite irritated her .
"` You are twenty thousand times braver than Tony , ' she said ; ` you are ever so much the bravest boy I ever knew . '"
"He could scarcely believe she meant it , but when he did believe he screamed with joy ."
"` And if you want very much to give me a kiss , ' Maimie said , ` you can do it . '"
Very reluctantly Peter began to take the thimble off his finger .
He thought she wanted it back . '
"I do n't mean a kiss , ' she said hurriedly , ' I mean a thimble . '"
` What 's that ? '
Peter asked .
"` It 's like this , ' she said , and kissed him . '"
"I should love to give you a thimble , ' Peter said gravely , so he gave her one ."
"He gave her quite a number of thimbles , and then a delightful idea came into his head ."
"` Maimie , ' he said , ` will you marry me ? '"
"-LSB- Illustration : ` My Lord Duke , ' said the physician elatedly , ' I have the honour to inform your excellency that your grace is in love ' -RSB- Now , strange to tell , the same idea had come at exactly the same time into Maimie 's head . '"
"I should like to , ' she answered , ` but will there be room in your boat for two ? '"
"` If you squeeze close , ' he said eagerly ."
` Perhaps the birds would be angry ? '
"He assured her that the birds would love to have her , though I am not so certain of it myself ."
It 's from Doctor Forbes 's little girls -- the ones that gave me the mittens . ''
"He handed her the little note , and Mrs. Ross stooped down and read it by the fitful gleam of light which came from the cracked stove ."
"`` Well , you can please yourself , '' she said as she handed it back , `` but William John could n't go if he had ten invitations ."
He caught cold coasting yesterday .
"I told him he would , but he was bound to go , and now he 's laid up for a week ."
Listen to him barking in the bedroom there . ''
"`` Well , then , I wo n't go either , '' said Bertie with a sigh , it might be of relief , or it might be of disappointment ."
`` I would n't go there all alone . ''
`` You 're a goose ! ''
said his aunt .
`` They would n't eat you .
"But as I said , please yourself ."
"Anyhow , hold your tongue about it to William John , or you 'll have him crying and bawling to go too . ''"
The caution came too late .
"William John had already heard it , and when his mother went in to rub his chest with liniment , she found him with the ragged quilt over his head crying ."
"`` Come , William John , I want to rub you . ''"
"`` I do n't want to be rubbed -- g ` way , '' sobbed William John ."
`` I heard you out there -- you need n't think I did n't .
Bertie 's going to Doctor Forbes 's to dinner and I ca n't go . ''
"`` Well , you 've only yourself to thank for it , '' returned his mother ."
"`` If you had n't persisted in going out coasting yesterday when I wanted you to stay in , you 'd have been able to go to Doctor Forbes 's ."
Little boys who wo n't do as they 're told always get into trouble .
"Stop crying , now ."
"I dare say if Bertie goes they 'll send you some candy , or something . ''"
But William John refused to be comforted .
"He cried himself to sleep that night , and when Bertie went in to see him next morning , he found him sitting up in bed with his eyes red and swollen and the faded quilt drawn up around his pinched face ."
"`` Well , William John , how are you ? ''"
"`` I ai n't any better , '' replied William John mournfully ."
"`` I s ` pose you 'll have a great time tomorrow night , Bertie ? ''"
"`` Oh , I 'm not going since you ca n't , '' said Bertie cheerily ."
"He thought this would comfort William John , but it had exactly the opposite effect ."
"William John had cried until he could cry no more , but he turned around and sobbed ."
"`` Are all the children chained , so that they can not fly away ? ''"
"`` Ay , ay . ''"
`` Then hoist them up . ''
"The wretched prisoners were dragged from the hold , all except Wendy , and ranged in line in front of him ."
For a time he seemed unconscious of their presence .
"He lolled at his ease , humming , not unmelodiously , snatches of a rude song , and fingering a pack of cards ."
Ever and anon the light from his cigar gave a touch of colour to his face .
"`` Now then , bullies , '' he said briskly , `` six of you walk the plank to-night , but I have room for two cabin boys ."
Which of you is it to be ? ''
"`` Do n't irritate him unnecessarily , '' had been Wendy 's instructions in the hold ; so Tootles stepped forward politely ."
"Tootles hated the idea of signing under such a man , but an instinct told him that it would be prudent to lay the responsibility on an absent person ; and though a somewhat silly boy , he knew that mothers alone are always willing to be the buffer ."
"All children know this about mothers , and despise them for it , but make constant use of it ."
"So Tootles explained prudently , `` You see , sir , I do n't think my mother would like me to be a pirate ."
"Would your mother like you to be a pirate , Slightly ? ''"
"He winked at Slightly , who said mournfully , `` I do n't think so , '' as if he wished things had been otherwise ."
"`` Would your mother like you to be a pirate , Twin ? ''"
"`` I do n't think so , '' said the first twin , as clever as the others ."
"`` Nibs , would -- '' `` Stow this gab , '' roared Hook , and the spokesmen were dragged back ."
"`` You , boy , '' he said , addressing John , `` you look as if you had a little pluck in you ."
"Didst never want to be a pirate , my hearty ? ''"
Now John had sometimes experienced this hankering at maths .
prep. ; and he was struck by Hook 's picking him out .
"`` I once thought of calling myself Red-handed Jack , '' he said diffidently ."
`` And a good name too .
"We 'll call you that here , bully , if you join . ''"
"`` What do you think , Michael ? ''"
asked John .
`` What would you call me if I join ? ''
Michael demanded .
`` Blackbeard Joe . ''
Michael was naturally impressed .
"`` What do you think , John ? ''"
Anne kept a sober face until she got downstairs and then she collapsed on the sitting room lounge and laughed until her sides ached .
"`` I wish you 'd tell me the joke , '' said Marilla , a little grimly ."
`` I have n't seen much to laugh at today . ''
"`` You 'll laugh when you hear this , '' assured Anne ."
"And Marilla did laugh , which showed how much her education had advanced since the adoption of Anne ."
But she sighed immediately afterwards .
"`` I suppose I should n't have told him that , although I heard a minister say it to a child once ."
But he did aggravate me so .
It was that night you were at the Carmody concert and I was putting him to bed .
He said he did n't see the good of praying until he got big enough to be of some importance to God .
"Anne , I do not know what we are going to do with that child ."
I never saw his beat .
I 'm feeling clean discouraged . ''
"`` Oh , do n't say that , Marilla ."
Remember how bad I was when I came here . ''
"`` Anne , you never were bad ... NEVER ."
"I see that now , when I 've learned what real badness is ."
"You were always getting into terrible scrapes , I 'll admit , but your motive was always good ."
Davy is just bad from sheer love of it . ''
"`` Oh , no , I do n't think it is real badness with him either , '' pleaded Anne ."
`` It 's just mischief .
"And it is rather quiet for him here , you know ."
He has no other boys to play with and his mind has to have something to occupy it .
Dora is so prim and proper she is no good for a boy 's playmate .
"I really think it would be better to let them go to school , Marilla . ''"
"`` No , '' said Marilla resolutely , `` my father always said that no child should be cooped up in the four walls of a school until it was seven years old , and Mr. Allan says the same thing ."
The twins can have a few lessons at home but go to school they sha n't till they 're seven . ''
"`` Well , we must try to reform Davy at home then , '' said Anne cheerfully ."
`` With all his faults he 's really a dear little chap .
I ca n't help loving him .
"Marilla , it may be a dreadful thing to say , but honestly , I like Davy better than Dora , for all she 's so good . ''"
"`` I do n't know but that I do , myself , '' confessed Marilla , `` and it is n't fair , for Dora is n't a bit of trouble ."
Then the talk drifted around to Edith 's affairs .
"She was engaged to a certain Sidney Keith , who was a professor in some college ."
"`` I do n't expect to see much of Sidney this summer , '' said Edith ."
`` He 's writing another book .
He is so terribly addicted to literature . ''
"`` How lovely , '' sighed Katherine , who had aspirations in that line herself ."
`` If only Ned were like him I should be perfectly happy .
But Ned is so prosaic .
"He does n't care a rap for poetry , and he laughs when I enthuse ."
It makes him quite furious when I talk of taking up writing seriously .
He says women writers are an abomination on the face of the earth .
Did you ever hear anything so ridiculous ? ''
"`` He is very handsome , though , '' said Edith , with a glance at his photograph on Katherine 's dressing table ."
`` And that is what Sid is not .
"He is rather distinguished looking , but as plain as he can possibly be . ''"
Edith sighed .
She had a weakness for handsome men and thought it rather hard that fate should have allotted her so plain a lover .
"`` He has lovely eyes , '' said Katherine comfortingly , `` and handsome men are always vain ."
Even Ned is .
I have to snub him regularly .
But I think you 'll like him . ''
Edith thought so too when Ned Ellison appeared that night .
"He was a handsome off-handed young fellow , who seemed to admire Katherine immensely , and be a little afraid of her into the bargain ."
"`` Edith will try to make Riverton pleasant for you while I am away , '' she told him in their good-bye chat ."
"`` She is a dear girl -- you 'll like her , I know ."
"It 's really too bad I have to go away now , but it ca n't be helped . ''"
"`` I shall be awfully lonesome , '' grumbled Ned ."
"`` Do n't you forget to write regularly , Kitty . ''"
"`` Of course I 'll write , but for pity 's sake , Ned , do n't call me Kitty ."
It sounds so childish .
"Well , bye-bye , dear boy ."
I 'll be back in two months and then we 'll have a lovely time . ''
"He wanted John to decide , and John wanted him to decide ."
`` Shall we still be respectful subjects of the King ? ''
John inquired .
"Through Hook 's teeth came the answer : `` You would have to swear , ` Down with the King . ' ''"
"Perhaps John had not behaved very well so far , but he shone out now ."
"`` Then I refuse , '' he cried , banging the barrel in front of Hook ."
"`` And I refuse , '' cried Michael ."
`` Rule Britannia ! ''
squeaked Curly .
"The infuriated pirates buffeted them in the mouth ; and Hook roared out , `` That seals your doom ."
Bring up their mother .
Get the plank ready . ''
"They were only boys , and they went white as they saw Jukes and Cecco preparing the fatal plank ."
But they tried to look brave when Wendy was brought up .
No words of mine can tell you how Wendy despised those pirates .
To the boys there was at least some glamour in the pirate calling ; but all that she saw was that the ship had not been tidied for years .
There was not a porthole on the grimy glass of which you might not have written with your finger `` Dirty pig '' ; and she had already written it on several .
"But as the boys gathered round her she had no thought , of course , save for them ."
"`` So , my beauty , '' said Hook , as if he spoke in syrup , `` you are to see your children walk the plank . ''"
"Fine gentlemen though he was , the intensity of his communings had soiled his ruff , and suddenly he knew that she was gazing at it ."
"With a hasty gesture he tried to hide it , but he was too late ."
`` Are they to die ? ''
"asked Wendy , with a look of such frightful contempt that he nearly fainted ."
"`` They are , '' he snarled ."
"`` Silence all , '' he called gloatingly , `` for a mother 's last words to her children . ''"
At this moment Wendy was grand .
"`` These are my last words , dear boys , '' she said firmly ."
"`` I feel that I have a message to you from your real mothers , and it is this : ` We hope our sons will die like English gentlemen . ' ''"
"Even the pirates were awed , and Tootles cried out hysterically , `` I am going to do what my mother hopes ."
"What are you to do , Nibs ? ''"
`` What my mother hopes .
"What are you to do , Twin ? ''"
"The boy started , stopped and looked out towards Island Rock ."
The next moment he hailed me .
"It was Ernest 's voice , and it was Laddie who was barking beside him ."
"`` Ernest , '' I shouted wildly , `` run for help -- quick !"
quick !
The tide will be over the rock in half an hour !
"Hurry , or you will be too late ! ''"
"Instead of starting off at full speed , as I expected him to do , Ernest stood still for a moment , and then began to pick his steps down a narrow path over the cliff , followed by Laddie ."
"`` Ernest , '' I shouted frantically , `` what are you doing ?"
Why do n't you go for help ? ''
Ernest had by this time reached a narrow ledge of rock just above the water-line .
I noticed that he was carrying something over his arm .
"`` It would take too long , '' he shouted ."
"`` By the time I got to the Cove and a boat could row back here , you 'd be drowned ."
Laddie and I will save you .
Is there anything there you can tie a rope to ?
I 've a coil of rope here that I think will be long enough to reach you .
I 've been down to the Cove and Alec Martin sent it up to your uncle . ''
"I looked about me ; a smooth , round hole had been worn clean through a thin part of the apex of the rock ."
`` I could fasten the rope if I had it ! ''
I called .
`` But how can you get it to me ? ''
For answer Ernest tied a bit of driftwood to the rope and put it into Laddie 's mouth .
The next minute the dog was swimming out to me .
As soon as he came close I caught the rope .
"It was just long enough to stretch from shore to rock , allowing for a couple of hitches which Ernest gave around a small boulder on the ledge ."
"I tied my camera case on my head by means of some string I found in my pocket , then I slipped into the water and , holding to the rope , went hand over hand to the shore with Laddie swimming beside me ."
"Ernest held on to the shoreward end of the rope like grim death , a task that was no light one for his small arms ."
"When I finally scrambled up beside him , his face was dripping with perspiration and he trembled like a leaf ."
"`` Ern , you are a brick ! ''"
I exclaimed .
`` You 've saved my life ! ''
"Do n't you tell me I 'm like that old gossip , '' said Mr. Harrison irritably ."
`` I 'm not ... not a bit .
What have you got in that box ? ''
"`` A cake , '' said Anne archly ."
In her relief at Mr. Harrison 's unexpected amiability her spirits soared upward feather-light .
`` I brought it over for you ... I thought perhaps you did n't have cake very often . ''
"`` I do n't , that 's a fact , and I 'm mighty fond of it , too ."
I 'm much obliged to you .
It looks good on top .
I hope it 's good all the way through . ''
"`` It is , '' said Anne , gaily confident ."
"`` I have made cakes in my time that were NOT , as Mrs. Allan could tell you , but this one is all right ."
"I made it for the Improvement Society , but I can make another for them . ''"
"`` Well , I 'll tell you what , miss , you must help me eat it ."
I 'll put the kettle on and we 'll have a cup of tea .
How will that do ? ''
`` Will you let me make the tea ? ''
said Anne dubiously .
Mr. Harrison chuckled .
`` I see you have n't much confidence in my ability to make tea .
You 're wrong ... I can brew up as good a jorum of tea as you ever drank .
But go ahead yourself .
"Fortunately it rained last Sunday , so there 's plenty of clean dishes . ''"
Anne hopped briskly up and went to work .
She washed the teapot in several waters before she put the tea to steep .
"Then she swept the stove and set the table , bringing the dishes out of the pantry ."
"The state of that pantry horrified Anne , but she wisely said nothing ."
Mr. Harrison told her where to find the bread and butter and a can of peaches .
Anne adorned the table with a bouquet from the garden and shut her eyes to the stains on the tablecloth .
"Soon the tea was ready and Anne found herself sitting opposite Mr. Harrison at his own table , pouring his tea for him , and chatting freely to him about her school and friends and plans ."
She could hardly believe the evidence of her senses .
"Mr. Harrison had brought Ginger back , averring that the poor bird would be lonesome ; and Anne , feeling that she could forgive everybody and everything , offered him a walnut ."
"`` Ai n't you gone yet , Bert ? ''"
she said sharply .
`` What in the world are you hanging round for ? ''
"`` It 's early yet , '' said Bertie cheerfully ."
`` I thought maybe George Fraser 'd be along and I 'd get a lift as far as the store . ''
"`` Well , I never saw such laziness !"
No wonder old Sampson wo n't keep you longer than the holidays if you 're no smarter than that .
"Goodness , if I do n't settle that boy ! ''"
-- as the sound of fretful crying came from the kitchen behind her .
`` What is wrong with William John ? ''
asked Bertie .
"`` Why , he wants to go out coasting with those Robinson boys , but he ca n't ."
He has n't got any mittens and he would catch his death of cold again . ''
Her voice seemed to imply that William John had died of cold several times already .
"Bertie looked soberly down at his old , well-darned mittens ."
"It was very cold , and he would have a great many errands to run ."
"He shivered , and looked up at his aunt 's hard face as she stood wiping her dish-pan with a grim frown which boded no good to the discontented William John ."
Then he suddenly pulled off his mittens and held them out .
`` Here -- he can have mine .
I 'll get on without them well enough . ''
`` Nonsense ! ''
"said Mrs. Ross , but less unkindly ."
`` The fingers would freeze off you .
Do n't be a goose . ''
"`` It 's all right , '' persisted Bertie ."
`` I do n't need them -- much .
And William John does n't hardly ever get out . ''
"He thrust them into her hand and ran quickly down the street , as though he feared that the keen air might make him change his mind in spite of himself ."
He had to stop a great many times that day to breathe on his purple hands .
"Still , he did not regret having lent his mittens to William John -- poor , pale , sickly little William John , who had so few pleasures ."
It was sunset when Bertie laid an armful of parcels down on the steps of Doctor Forbes 's handsome house .
"His back was turned towards the big bay window at one side , and he was busy trying to warm his hands , so he did not see the two small faces looking at him through the frosty panes ."
"An I had known , I should have seen the varlet hanged ere I had told him ."
"Well , if he goes through the fen , I may come up with him and pull his ears . ''"
"Half an hour later , Sir Daniel gave Dick the letter , and bade him speed to the Moat House ."
"And , again , some half an hour after Dick 's departure , a messenger came , in hot haste , from my Lord of Risingham ."
"`` Sir Daniel , '' the messenger said , `` ye lose great honour , by my sooth !"
"The fight began again this morning ere the dawn , and we have beaten their van and scattered their right wing ."
Only the main battle standeth fast .
"An we had your fresh men , we should tilt you them all into the river ."
"What , sir knight !"
Will ye be the last ?
It stands not with your good credit . ''
"`` Nay , '' cried the knight , `` I was but now upon the march ."
"Selden , sound me the tucket ."
"Sir , I am with you on the instant ."
"It is not two hours since the more part of my command came in , sir messenger ."
What would ye have ?
"Spurring is good meat , but yet it killed the charger ."
"Bustle , boys ! ''"
"By this time the tucket was sounding cheerily in the morning , and from all sides Sir Daniel 's men poured into the main street and formed before the inn ."
"They had slept upon their arms , with chargers saddled , and in ten minutes five-score men-at-arms and archers , cleanly equipped and briskly disciplined , stood ranked and ready ."
"The chief part were in Sir Daniel 's livery , murrey and blue , which gave the greater show to their array ."
"The best armed rode first ; and away out of sight , at the tail of the column , came the sorry reinforcement of the night before ."
Sir Daniel looked with pride along the line .
"`` Here be the lads to serve you in a pinch , '' he said ."
"`` They are pretty men , indeed , '' replied the messenger ."
`` It but augments my sorrow that ye had not marched the earlier . ''
"`` Well , '' said the knight , `` what would ye ?"
"The beginning of a feast and the end of a fray , sir messenger ; '' and he mounted into his saddle ."
`` Why !
how now ! ''
he cried .
`` John !
cried Dick .
`` Would ye mind a ducking ?
Blood of wound or dust of travel -- that 's a man 's adornment . ''
"`` Nay , then , I like him better plain , '' observed the lad ."
"`` But , prithee , how shall I do ?"
"Prithee , good Master Richard , help me with your good counsel ."
"If I come not safe to Holywood , I am undone . ''"
"`` Nay , '' said Dick , dismounting , `` I will give more than counsel ."
"Take my horse , and I will run awhile , and when I am weary we shall change again , that so , riding and running , both may go the speedier . ''"
"So the change was made , and they went forward as briskly as they durst on the uneven causeway , Dick with his hand upon the other 's knee ."
`` How call ye your name ? ''
asked Dick .
"`` Call me John Matcham , '' replied the lad ."
`` And what make ye to Holywood ? ''
Dick continued .
"`` I seek sanctuary from a man that would oppress me , '' was the answer ."
`` The good Abbot of Holywood is a strong pillar to the weak . ''
"`` And how came ye with Sir Daniel , Master Matcham ? ''"
pursued Dick .
"`` Nay , '' cried the other , `` by the abuse of force !"
"He hath taken me by violence from my own place ; dressed me in these weeds ; ridden with me till my heart was sick ; gibed me till I could ` a ' wept ; and when certain of my friends pursued , thinking to have me back , claps me in the rear to stand their shot !"
"I was even grazed in the right foot , and walk but lamely ."
"Nay , there shall come a day between us ; he shall smart for all ! ''"
`` Would ye shoot at the moon with a hand-gun ? ''
said Dick . ''
"'T is a valiant knight , and hath a hand of iron ."
"An he guessed I had made or meddled with your flight , it would go sore with me . ''"
"`` Ay , poor boy , '' returned the other , `` y ' are his ward , I know it ."
"By the same token , so am I , or so he saith ; or else he hath bought my marriage -- I wot not rightly which ; but it is some handle to oppress me by . ''"
`` Boy again ! ''
said Dick .
"`` Nay , then , shall I call you girl , good Richard ? ''"
Do n't you think it 's about time I joined up ? ''
The pale mother looked at him .
`` Two of my sons have gone and one will never return .
"Must I give you too , Shirley ? ''"
The age-old cry -- `` Joseph is not and Simeon is not ; and ye will take Benjamin away . ''
How the mothers of the Great War echoed the old Patriarch 's moan of so many centuries agone !
"`` You would n't have me a slacker , mother ?"
I can get into the flying-corps .
"What say , dad ? ''"
The doctor 's hands were not quite steady as he folded up the powders he was concocting for Abbie Flagg 's rheumatism .
"He had known this moment was coming , yet he was not altogether prepared for it ."
"He answered slowly , `` I wo n't try to hold you back from what you believe to be your duty ."
But you must not go unless your mother says you may . ''
Shirley said nothing more .
He was not a lad of many words .
"Anne did not say anything more just then , either ."
"She was thinking of little Joyce 's grave in the old burying-ground over-harbour -- little Joyce who would have been a woman now , had she lived -- of the white cross in France and the splendid grey eyes of the little boy who had been taught his first lessons of duty and loyalty at her knee -- of Jem in the terrible trenches -- of Nan and Di and Rilla , waiting -- waiting -- waiting , while the golden years of youth passed by -- and she wondered if she could bear any more ."
She thought not ; surely she had given enough .
Yet that night she told Shirley that he might go .
They did not tell Susan right away .
"She did not know it until , a few days later , Shirley presented himself in her kitchen in his aviation uniform ."
Susan did n't make half the fuss she had made when Jem and Walter had gone .
"She said stonily , `` So they 're going to take you , too . ''"
`` Take me ?
No .
"I 'm going , Susan -- got to . ''"
"Susan sat down by the table , folded her knotted old hands , that had grown warped and twisted working for the Ingleside children to still their shaking , and said : `` Yes , you must go ."
"I did not see once why such things must be , but I can see now . ''"
"`` You 're a brick , Susan , '' said Shirley ."
"He was relieved that she took it so coolly -- he had been a little afraid , with a boy 's horror of `` a scene . ''"
"He went out whistling gaily ; but half an hour later , when pale Anne Blythe came in , Susan was still sitting there ."
"`` Mrs. Dr. dear , '' said Susan , making an admission she would once have died rather than make , `` I feel very old ."
"` Shall I after him , captain , ' asked pathetic Smee , ` and tickle him with Johnny Corkscrew ? '"
"Smee had pleasant names for everything , and his cutlass was Johnny Corkscrew , because he wriggled it in the wound ."
One could mention many lovable traits in Smee .
"For instance , after killing , it was his spectacles he wiped instead of his weapon ."
"` Johnny 's a silent fellow , ' he reminded Hook ."
"` Not now , Smee , ' Hook said darkly ."
"` He is only one , and I want to mischief all the seven ."
Scatter and look for them . '
"The pirates disappeared among the trees , and in a moment their captain and Smee were alone ."
"Hook heaved a heavy sigh ; and I know not why it was , perhaps it was because of the soft beauty of the evening , but there came over him a desire to confide to his faithful bo ` sun the story of his life ."
"He spoke long and earnestly , but what it was all about Smee , who was rather stupid , did not know in the least ."
Anon he caught the word Peter .
"` Most of all , ' Hook was saying passionately , ' I want their captain , Peter Pan ."
'T was he cut off my arm . '
He brandished the hook threateningly .
` I 've waited long to shake his hand with this .
"Oh , I 'll tear him . '"
"` And yet , ' said Smee , ' I have often heard you say that hook was worth a score of hands , for combing the hair and other homely uses . '"
"` Ay , ' the captain answered , ` if I was a mother I would pray to have my children born with this instead of that , ' and he cast a look of pride upon his iron hand and one of scorn upon the other ."
Then again he frowned .
"` Peter flung my arm , ' he said , wincing , ` to a crocodile that happened to be passing by . ' '"
"I have often , ' said Smee , ` noticed your strange dread of crocodiles . '"
"` Not of crocodiles , ' Hook corrected him , ` but of that one crocodile . '"
He lowered his voice .
"` It liked my arm so much , Smee , that it has followed me ever since , from sea to sea and from land to land , licking its lips for the rest of me . '"
"` In a way , ' said Smee , ` it 's a sort of compliment . ' '"
"I want no such compliments , ' Hook barked petulantly . '"
"I want Peter Pan , who first gave the brute its taste for me . '"
"He sat down on a large mushroom , and now there was a quiver in his voice ."
"` Smee , ' he said huskily , ` that crocodile would have had me before this , but by a lucky chance it swallowed a clock which goes tick tick inside it , and so before it can reach me I hear the tick and bolt . '"
"He laughed , but in a hollow way ."
"` Some day , ' said Smee , ` the clock will run down , and then he 'll get you . '"
"And how long is it before Marilla expects to be stone blind , Anne ? ''"
"`` The doctor thinks her eyes will not get any worse if she is very careful , '' faltered Anne ."
Eliza shook her head .
`` Doctors always talk like that just to keep people cheered up .
I would n't have much hope if I was her .
It 's best to be prepared for the worst . ''
`` But ought n't we be prepared for the best too ? ''
pleaded Anne .
`` It 's just as likely to happen as the worst . ''
"`` Not in my experience , and I 've fifty-seven years to set against your sixteen , '' retorted Eliza ."
"`` Going , are you ?"
"Well , I hope this new society of yours will be able to keep Avonlea from running any further down hill but I have n't much hope of it . ''"
"Anne and Diana got themselves thankfully out , and drove away as fast as the fat pony could go ."
"As they rounded the curve below the beech wood a plump figure came speeding over Mr. Andrews ' pasture , waving to them excitedly ."
"It was Catherine Andrews and she was so out of breath that she could hardly speak , but she thrust a couple of quarters into Anne 's hand ."
"`` That 's my contribution to painting the hall , '' she gasped ."
`` I 'd like to give you a dollar but I do n't dare take more from my egg money for Eliza would find it out if I did .
I 'm real interested in your society and I believe you 're going to do a lot of good .
I 'm an optimist .
"I HAVE to be , living with Eliza ."
I must hurry back before she misses me ... she thinks I 'm feeding the hens .
"I hope you 'll have good luck canvassing , and do n't be cast down over what Eliza said ."
The world IS getting better ... it certainly is . ''
The next house was Daniel Blair 's .
"`` Now , it all depends on whether his wife is home or not , '' said Diana , as they jolted along a deep-rutted lane ."
`` If she is we wo n't get a cent .
"Everybody says Dan Blair does n't dare have his hair cut without asking her permission ; and it 's certain she 's very close , to state it moderately ."
She says she has to be just before she 's generous .
But Mrs. Lynde says she 's so much ` before ' that generosity never catches up with her at all . ''
Anne related their experience at the Blair place to Marilla that evening .
`` We tied the horse and then rapped at the kitchen door .
"Nobody came but the door was open and we could hear somebody in the pantry , going on dreadfully ."
"Sailors do n't always use the choicest language , and parrots are very imitative birds . ''"
"`` So I should think , '' said poor Anne , the remembrance of her errand quelling her resentment ."
"She could n't afford to snub Mr. Harrison under the circumstances , that was certain ."
"When you had just sold a man 's Jersey cow offhand , without his knowledge or consent you must not mind if his parrot repeated uncomplimentary things ."
"Nevertheless , the `` redheaded snippet '' was not quite so meek as she might otherwise have been ."
"`` I 've come to confess something to you , Mr. Harrison , '' she said resolutely ."
`` It 's ... it 's about ... that Jersey cow . ''
"`` Bless my soul , '' exclaimed Mr. Harrison nervously , `` has she gone and broken into my oats again ?"
"Well , never mind ... never mind if she has ."
"It 's no difference ... none at all , I ... I was too hasty yesterday , that 's a fact ."
Never mind if she has . ''
"`` Oh , if it were only that , '' sighed Anne ."
`` But it 's ten times worse .
"I do n't ... '' `` Bless my soul , do you mean to say she 's got into my wheat ? ''"
`` No ... no ... not the wheat .
But ... '' `` Then it 's the cabbages !
"She 's broken into my cabbages that I was raising for Exhibition , hey ? ''"
"`` It 's NOT the cabbages , Mr. Harrison ."
I 'll tell you everything ... that is what I came for -- but please do n't interrupt me .
It makes me so nervous .
"Just let me tell my story and do n't say anything till I get through -- and then no doubt you 'll say plenty , '' Anne concluded , but in thought only ."
"`` I wo n't say another word , '' said Mr. Harrison , and he did n't ."
"But Ginger was not bound by any contract of silence and kept ejaculating , `` Redheaded snippet '' at intervals until Anne felt quite wild ."
`` I shut my Jersey cow up in our pen yesterday .
This morning I went to Carmody and when I came back I saw a Jersey cow in your oats .
Diana and I chased her out and you ca n't imagine what a hard time we had .
I was so dreadfully wet and tired and vexed -- and Mr. Shearer came by that very minute and offered to buy the cow .
I sold her to him on the spot for twenty dollars .
It was wrong of me .
"I should have waited and consulted Marilla , of course ."
But I 'm dreadfully given to doing things without thinking -- everybody who knows me will tell you that .
Mr. Shearer took the cow right away to ship her on the afternoon train . ''
They go on with their recollections .
"` It was then that I rushed in like a tornado , was n't it ? '"
"Mr. Darling would say , scorning himself ; and indeed he had been like a tornado ."
Perhaps there was some excuse for him .
"He , too , had been dressing for the party , and all had gone well with him until he came to his tie ."
"It is an astounding thing to have to tell , but this man , though he knew about stocks and shares , had no real mastery of his tie ."
"Sometimes the thing yielded to him without a contest , but there were occasions when it would have been better for the house if he had swallowed his pride and used a made-up tie ."
This was such an occasion .
He came rushing into the nursery with the crumpled little brute of a tie in his hand .
"` Why , what is the matter , father dear ? '"
` Matter ! '
he yelled ; he really yelled .
"` This tie , it will not tie . '"
He became dangerously sarcastic .
` Not round my neck !
Round the bed-post !
"Oh yes , twenty times have I made it up round the bed-post , but round my neck , no !"
Oh dear no !
begs to be excused ! '
"He thought Mrs. Darling was not sufficiently impressed , and he went on sternly , ' I warn you of this , mother , that unless this tie is round my neck we do n't go out to dinner to-night , and if I do n't go out to dinner to-night , I never go to the office again , and if I do n't go to the office again , you and I starve , and our children will be flung into the streets . '"
Even then Mrs. Darling was placid .
"` Let me try , dear , ' she said , and indeed that was what he had come to ask her to do ; and with her nice cool hands she tied his tie for him , while the children stood around to see their fate decided ."
"Some men would have resented her being able to do it so easily , but Mr. Darling was far too fine a nature for that ; he thanked her carelessly , at once forgot his rage , and in another moment was dancing round the room with Michael on his back ."
` How wildly we romped ! '
"says Mrs. Darling now , recalling it ."
` Our last romp ! '
Mr. Darling groaned . '
"O George , do you remember Michael suddenly said to me , `` How did you get to know me , mother ? '' ' '"
I remember ! '
"` They were rather sweet , do n't you think , George ? '"
"` And they were ours , ours , and now they are gone . '"
"The romp had ended with the appearance of Nana , and most unluckily Mr. Darling collided against her , covering his trousers with hairs ."
"`` Nothing more -- at least , nothing about you ."
The rest was about myself -- I did not mind it -- much .
But I was so sorry to think that I had done you harm .
It is not too late to undo it .
You must not come here any more .
Then they will forget . ''
`` Perhaps -- but I should not forget .
It 's a little too late for me .
"Lynde , you must not let this venomous letter come between us ."
"I love you , dear -- I 've loved you ever since I met you and I want you for my wife . ''"
"Alan had not intended to say that just then , but the words came to his lips in spite of himself ."
She looked so sad and appealing and weary that he wanted to have the right to comfort and protect her .
She turned her eyes full upon him with no hint of maidenly shyness or shrinking in them .
"Instead , they were full of a blank , incredulous horror that swallowed up every other feeling ."
There was no mistaking their expression and it struck an icy chill to Alan 's heart .
He had certainly not expected a too ready response on her part -- he knew that even if she cared for him he might find it a matter of time to win her avowal of it -- but he certainly had not expected to see such evident abject dismay as her blanched face betrayed .
She put up her hand as if warding a blow .
"`` Do n't -- do n't , '' she gasped ."
`` You must not say that -- you must never say it .
"Oh , I never dreamed of this ."
"If I had thought it possible you could -- love me , I would never have been friends with you ."
"Oh , I 've made a terrible mistake . ''"
"She wrung her hands piteously together , looking like a soul in torment ."
Alan could not bear to see her pain .
"`` Do n't feel such distress , '' he implored ."
"`` I suppose I 've spoken too abruptly -- but I 'll be so patient , dear , if you 'll only try to care for me a little ."
"Ca n't you , dear ? ''"
"`` I ca n't marry you , '' said Lynde desperately ."
She leaned against a slim white bole of a young birch behind her and looked at him wretchedly .
`` Wo n't you please go away and forget me ? ''
"`` I ca n't forget you , '' Alan said , smiling a little in spite of his suffering ."
`` You are the only woman I can ever love -- and I ca n't give you up unless I have to .
All the Turks jumped so high that their slippers flew above their heads ; such a splendid glitter they had never seen before .
Now they could quite well understand that it was the god of the Turks himself who was to marry the princess .
"As soon as the young merchant came down again into the wood with his trunk he thought , ` Now I will just go into the town to see how the show has taken . '"
And it was quite natural that he should want to do this .
Oh !
what stories the people had to tell !
"Each one whom he asked had seen it differently , but they had all found it beautiful . '"
"I saw the Turkish god himself , ' said one ."
"` He had eyes like glittering stars , and a beard like foaming water . '"
"` He flew away in a cloak of fire , ' said another ."
"They were splendid things that he heard , and the next day was to be his wedding day ."
Then he went back into the wood to sit in his trunk ; but what had become of it ?
The trunk had been burnt .
"A spark of the fireworks had set it alight , and the trunk was in ashes ."
"He could no longer fly , and could never reach his bride ."
She stood the whole day long on the roof and waited ; perhaps she is waiting there still .
But he wandered through the world and told stories ; though they are not so merry as the one he told about the matches .
The Snow-man Translated from the German of Hans Andersen .
` How astonishingly cold it is !
My body is cracking all over ! '
said the Snow-man .
` The wind is really cutting one 's very life out !
And how that fiery thing up there glares ! '
"He meant the sun , which was just setting ."
"` It sha 'n' t make me blink , though , and I shall keep quite cool and collected . '"
"Instead of eyes he had two large three-cornered pieces of slate in his head ; his mouth consisted of an old rake , so that he had teeth as well ."
"He was born amidst the shouts and laughter of the boys , and greeted by the jingling bells and cracking whips of the sledges ."
"The sun went down , the full moon rose , large , round , clear and beautiful , in the dark blue sky ."
` There it is again on the other side ! '
"said the Snow-man , by which he meant the sun was appearing again . '"
I have become quite accustomed to its glaring .
"I hope it will hang there and shine , so that I may be able to see myself ."
"It were no help to me , good boy ."
But yet I thank you . ''
"The night had now fallen , and under the trees they could no longer read each other 's face ."
"`` I will go some little way with you , '' said Dick ."
`` The night is dark .
"I would fain leave you on a path , at least ."
"My mind misgiveth me , y ' are likely to be lost . ''"
"Without any more words , he began to walk forward , and the other once more followed him ."
The blackness grew thicker and thicker .
"Only here and there , in open places , they saw the sky , dotted with small stars ."
"In the distance , the noise of the rout of the Lancastrian army still continued to be faintly audible ; but with every step they left it farther in the rear ."
At the end of half an hour of silent progress they came forth upon a broad patch of heathy open .
"It glimmered in the light of the stars , shaggy with fern and islanded with clumps of yew ."
And here they paused and looked upon each other .
`` Y ' are weary ? ''
Dick said .
"`` Nay , I am so weary , '' answered Matcham , `` that methinks I could lie down and die . ''"
"`` I hear the chiding of a river , '' returned Dick ."
"`` Let us go so far forth , for I am sore athirst . ''"
"The ground sloped down gently ; and , sure enough , in the bottom , they found a little murmuring river , running among willows ."
"Here they threw themselves down together by the brink ; and putting their mouths to the level of a starry pool , they drank their fill ."
"`` Dick , '' said Matcham , `` it may not be ."
I can no more . ''
"`` I saw a pit as we came down , '' said Dick ."
`` Let us lie down therein and sleep . ''
"`` Nay , but with all my heart ! ''"
cried Matcham .
"The pit was sandy and dry ; a shock of brambles hung upon one hedge , and made a partial shelter ; and there the two lads lay down , keeping close together for the sake of warmth , their quarrel all forgotten ."
"And soon sleep fell upon them like a cloud , and under the dew and stars they rested peacefully ."
"CHAPTER VII -- THE HOODED FACE They awoke in the grey of the morning ; the birds were not yet in full song , but twittered here and there among the woods ; the sun was not yet up , but the eastern sky was barred with solemn colours ."
"Half starved and over-weary as they were , they lay without moving , sunk in a delightful lassitude ."
"And as they thus lay , the clang of a bell fell suddenly upon their ears ."
"To put it with brutal frankness , there never was a cockier boy ."
But for the moment Wendy was shocked .
"` You conceit , ' she exclaimed , with frightful sarcasm ; ` of course I did nothing ! '"
"` You did a little , ' Peter said carelessly , and continued to dance . '"
A little ! '
she replied with hauteur ; ` if I am no use I can at least withdraw ' ; and she sprang in the most dignified way into bed and covered her face with the blankets .
"To induce her to look up he pretended to be going away , and when this failed he sat on the end of the bed and tapped her gently with his foot ."
"` Wendy , ' he said , ` do n't withdraw ."
"I ca n't help crowing , Wendy , when I 'm pleased with myself . '"
"Still she would not look up , though she was listening eagerly ."
"` Wendy , ' he continued , in a voice that no woman has ever yet been able to resist , ` Wendy , one girl is more use than twenty boys . '"
"Now Wendy was every inch a woman , though there were not very many inches , and she peeped out of the bedclothes ."
"` Do you really think so , Peter ? '"
"` Yes , I do . ' '"
"I think it 's perfectly sweet of you , ' she declared , ` and I 'll get up again ' ; and she sat with him on the side of the bed ."
"She also said she would give him a kiss if he liked , but Peter did not know what she meant , and he held out his hand expectantly ."
` Surely you know what a kiss is ? '
"she asked , aghast . '"
"I shall know when you give it to me , ' he replied stiffly ; and not to hurt his feelings she gave him a thimble ."
"` Now , ' said he , ` shall I give you a kiss ? '"
"and she replied with a slight primness , ` If you please . '"
"She made herself rather cheap by inclining her face toward him , but he merely dropped an acorn button into her hand ; so she slowly returned her face to where it had been before , and said nicely that she would wear his kiss on the chain round her neck ."
"It was lucky that she did put it on that chain , for it was afterwards to save her life ."
"When people in our set are introduced , it is customary for them to ask each other 's age , and so Wendy , who always liked to do the correct thing , asked Peter how old he was ."
"It was not really a happy question to ask him ; it was like an examination paper that asks grammar , when what you want to be asked is Kings of England . '"
"I do n't know , ' he replied uneasily , ` but I am quite young . '"
"He really knew nothing about it ; he had merely suspicions , but he said at a venture , ` Wendy , I ran away the day I was born . '"
"Wendy was quite surprised , but interested ; and she indicated in the charming drawing-room manner , by a touch on her night-gown , that he could sit nearer her ."
"` It was because I heard father and mother , ' he explained in a low voice , ` talking about what I was to be when I became a man . '"
He was extraordinarily agitated now . '
"I do n't want ever to be a man , ' he said with passion . '"
I want always to be a little boy and to have fun .
Alan shook his head .
"`` No , that has nothing to do with it . ''"
`` And you wo n't come back ? ''
`` It is not a question of will .
I can not -- must not go . ''
"`` Lynde will break her heart then , '' said Emily in a tone of despair ."
`` I think not .
She is too strong and fine for that .
Help her all you can with sympathy but do n't torment her with any questions .
"You may tell her if you like that I advise her to confide the whole story to you , but if she can not do n't tease her to ."
Be very gentle with her . ''
`` You do n't need to tell me that .
I 'd rather die than hurt her .
I came here full of anger against you -- but I see now you are not to blame .
You are suffering too -- your face tells that .
"All the same , I wish you 'd never set foot in Four Winds ."
She was n't happy before but she was n't so miserable as she is now .
"Oh , I know Anthony is at the bottom of it all in some way but I wo n't ask you any more questions since you do n't feel free to answer them ."
But are you sure that nothing can be done to clear up the trouble ? ''
"`` Too sure , '' said Alan 's white lips ."
* * * * * The autumn dragged away .
Alan found out how much a man may suffer and yet go on living and working .
"As for that , his work was all that made life possible for him now and he flung himself into it with feverish energy , growing so thin and hollow-eyed over it that even Elder Trewin remonstrated and suggested a vacation -- a suggestion at which Alan merely smiled ."
A vacation which would take him away from Lynde 's neighbourhood -- the thought was not to be entertained .
"He never saw Lynde , for he never went to any part of the shore now ; yet he hungered constantly for the sight of her , the sound of her voice , the glance of her luminous eyes ."
"When he pictured her eating her heart out in the solitude of Four Winds , he clenched his hands in despair ."
"As for the possibility of Harmon 's return , Alan could never face it for a moment ."
"When it thrust its ugly presence into his thoughts , he put it away desperately ."
The man was dead -- or his fickle fancy had veered elsewhere .
Nothing else could explain his absence .
"But they could never know , and the uncertainty would forever stand between him and Lynde like a spectre ."
But he thought more of Lynde 's pain than his own .
"I must take the bridle off , ' said Peder ."
` It is not to be sold with the animal as is usually the case . '
"` I 'll give you a hundred dollars for the bridle , ' said the old man , taking out his purse ."
"` No , I ca n't sell it , ' replied Hans 's father ."
` Five hundred dollars ! '
` No . ' '
A thousand ! '
At this splendid offer Peder 's prudence gave way ; it was a shame to let so much money go .
So he agreed to accept it .
"But he could hardly hold the horse , it became so unmanageable ."
"So he gave the animal in charge to the old man , and went home with his two thousand dollars ."
"Kirsten , of course , was delighted at this new piece of good fortune , and insisted that the new house should be built and land bought ."
"This time Peder consented , and soon they had quite a fine farm ."
"Meanwhile the old man rode off on his new purchase , and when he came to a smithy he asked the smith to forge shoes for the horse ."
"The smith proposed that they should first have a drink together , and the horse was tied up by the spring whilst they went indoors ."
"The day was hot , and both men were thirsty , and , besides , they had much to say ; and so the hours slipped by and found them still talking ."
"Then the servant girl came out to fetch a pail of water , and , being a kind-hearted lass , she gave some to the horse to drink ."
What was her surprise when the animal said to her : ` Take off my bridle and you will save my life . ' '
"I dare not , ' said she ; ` your master will be so angry . '"
"` He can not hurt you , ' answered the horse , ` and you will save my life . '"
At that she took off the bridle ; but nearly fainted with astonishment when the horse turned into a dove and flew away just as the old man came out of the house .
Directly he saw what had happened he changed himself into a hawk and flew after the dove .
"Over the woods and fields they went , and at length they reached a king 's palace surrounded by beautiful gardens ."
The princess was walking with her attendants in the rose garden when the dove turned itself into a gold ring and fell at her feet .
"` Why , here is a ring ! '"
"she cried , ` where could it have come from ? '"
And picking it up she put it on her finger .
"As she did so the hill-man lost his power over Hans -- for of course you understand that it was he who had been the dog , the cow , the horse and the dove ."
"` Well , that is really strange , ' said the princess ."
` It fits me as though it had been made for me ! '
Just at that moment up came the king .
` Look at what I have found ! '
"In the pool of Corri-Bui swims a salmon with a skin that shines like silver , and whose gills are red -- bring them all to me , and then you shall know where dwell your brothers and your sister ! '"
` To-morrow at cock-crow I will begone ! '
answered Covan .
"The way to the mountain lay straight before him , and when he had climbed high he caught sight of the roe with the white feet and the spotted sides , on the peak in front ."
"Full of hope he set out in pursuit of her , but by the time he had reached that peak she had left it and was to be seen on another ."
"And so it always happened , and Covan 's courage had well-nigh failed him , when the thought of the Dog of Maol-mor darted into his mind ."
"` Oh , that he was here ! '"
he cried .
And looking up he saw him .
` Why did you summon me ? '
asked the Dog of Maol-mor .
"And when Covan had told him of his trouble , and how the roe always led him further and further , the Dog only answered : ` Fear nothing ; I will soon catch her for you . '"
And in a short while he laid the roe unhurt at Covan 's feet .
` What will you wish me to do with her ? '
said the Dog .
"And Covan answered : ` The old man bade me bring her , and the duck with the golden neck , and the salmon with the silver sides , to his cottage ; if I shall catch them , I know not ."
"But carry you the roe to the back of the cottage , and tether her so that she can not escape . '"
"` It shall be done , ' said the Dog of Maol-mor ."
"Then Covan sped to the lake which led to the land of the Sun , where the duck with the green body and the golden neck was swimming among the water-lilies ."
"` Surely I can catch him , good swimmer as I am , ' to himself ."
"But , if he could swim well , the duck could swim better , and at length his strength failed him , and he was forced to seek the land ."
` Oh that the black raven were here to help me ! '
he thought to himself .
And in a moment the black raven was perched on his shoulder .
` How can I help you ? '
asked the raven .
And Covan answered : ` Catch me the green duck that floats on the water . '
"And the raven flew with his strong wings and picked him up in his strong beak , and in another moment the bird was laid at the feet of Covan ."
"This time it was easy for the young man to carry his prize , and after giving thanks to the raven for his aid , he went on to the river ."
In the deep dark pool of which the old man had spoken the silver-sided salmon was lying under a rock .
"` Surely I , good fisher as I am , can catch him , ' said Covan son of Gorla ."
"And cutting a slender pole from a bush , he fastened a line to the end of it ."
"And the friends said to each other, ""Well, let us be thankful he is. We have been bothered enough by her coming to us for advice which she never followed."""
THE QUARRELSOME MOLE
"When the first hillock of fresh brown earth was thrown up in the edge of the Forest, the People who lived there said to each other. ""Can it be that we have a new neighbor?"""
"Perhaps the Rabbits, the Ground Hogs, and the Snakes cared the most, for they also made their homes in the ground; yet even the Orioles wanted to know all about it. None of them had ever been acquainted with a Mole."
"They had seen the ridges in the meadows beneath which the Moles had their runways, and they knew that when the Moles were making these long streets under ground, they had to cut an opening through the grass once in a while and throw the loose earth out. This new mound in the forest looked exactly like those in the meadow, so they decided there must be a Mole in the neighborhood."
"If that were so, somebody should call upon him and get acquainted; but how could they call? Mrs. Red Squirrel said: ""Why can't some of you people who are so clever at digging, burrow down and find him?"""
"""Yes indeed,"" twittered the birds; ""that is a good plan."""
"But Mr. Red Squirrel smiled at his wife and said: ""I am afraid, Bushy-tail (that was his pet name for her) that none of our friends here could overtake the Mole. You know he is a very fast runner. If they were following they could never catch him."""
"""Let them burrow down ahead of the place where he is working, then,"""
said she.
"""And the Mole would turn and go another way, not knowing it was a friend looking for him."""
"""Well, why not make an opening into one of his runways and go into it, hunting until he is found?"" said Mrs. Red Squirrel, who was like some other people in not wishing to give up her own ideas."
"""Yes,"" cried a mischievous young Woodpecker; ""let the Ground Hog go. You surely don't think him too fat?"""
"Now there was no denying that the Ground Hog was getting too stout to look well, and people thought he would be angry at this. Perhaps he was angry. The little Rabbits were sure of it. They said they knew by the expression of his tail. Still, you know, the Ground Hog came of a good family, and well-bred people do not say mean things even if they are annoyed. He combed the fur on his face with both paws, and answered with a polite bow: ""If I had the slender and graceful form of my charming friend, Mrs. Red Squirrel, I should be delighted to do as she suggests."""
"That was really a very clever thing for Mr. Ground Hog to say. It was much more agreeable than if he had grunted out, ""Much she knows about it! We burrowing people are all too large."" And now Mrs. Red Squirrel was pleased and happy although her plan was not used."
"That night Mrs. Ground Hog said to her husband: ""I didn't know you admired Mrs. Red Squirrel so much."" And he answered: ""Pooh! Admire her?"
"She is a very good-looking person for one of her family, and I want to be polite to her for her husband's sake. He and I have business together. But for my part I prefer more flesh. I could never have married a slender wife, and I am pleased to see, my dear, that you are stouter than you were."" And this also shows how clever a fellow Mr."
Ground Hog was.
"The very next night, as luck would have it, the Mole came out of his runway for a scamper on the grass. Mr. Ground Hog saw him and made his acquaintance. ""We are glad to have you come,"" said he. ""You will find it a pleasant neighborhood. People are very friendly."""
"""Well, I'm glad of that,"" answered the Mole. ""I don't see any sense in people being disagreeable, myself, but in the meadow which I have just left there were the worst neighbors in the world. I stood it just as long as I could, and then I moved."""
"""I am sorry to hear that,"" said the Ground Hog, gently. ""I had always supposed it a pleasant place to live in."" He began to wonder what kind of fellow the Mole was. He did not like to hear him say such unkind things before a new acquaintance. Sometimes unpleasant things have to be said, but it was not so now."
"""Umph!"" said the Mole. ""You have to live with people to know them. Of course, we Moles had no friends among the insects. We are always glad to meet them in the ground, but they do not seem so glad to meet us. That is easily understood when you remember what hungry people Moles are."
"Friendship is all very well, but when a fellow's stomach is empty, he can't let that stand in the way of a good dinner. There was no such reason why the Tree Frog or the Garter Snake should dislike me."""
"""Are you sure they did dislike you?"""
"""Certain of it. I remember how one night I wanted to talk with the Garter Snake, and asked him to come out of his hole for a visit in the moonlight. He wouldn't come."""
"""What did he say?"" asked the Ground Hog."
"""Not a word! And that was the worst of it. Think how provoking it was for me to stand there and call and call and not get any reply."""
"""Perhaps he was not at home,"" suggested the Ground Hog."
"""That's what he said when I spoke to him. Said he was spending the night down by the river. As though I'd be likely to believe that! I guess he saw that he couldn't fool me, though, for after I told him what I thought of him he wriggled away without saying a word."""
"""Still he is not so disagreeable as the Tree Frog,"" said the Mole, after a pause in which the Ground Hog had been trying not to laugh. The Ground Hog said afterward that it was the funniest sight imaginable to see the stout little Mole scampering back and forth in the moonlight, and stopping every few minutes to scold about the Meadow People. The twitching of his tiny tail and the jerky motions of his large, pink-palmed digging hands, showed how angry he grew in thinking of them, and his pink snout fairly quivered with rage."
"""I will tell you about the Tree Frog,"" said the Mole. ""He is one of these fellows who are always just so good-natured and polite. I can't endure them. I say it's putting on airs to act that way. I was telling him what I thought of the Garter Snake, and what should he do but draw himself up and say: 'Excuse me, but the Garter Snake is a particular friend of mine, and I do not care to hear him spoken of in that way.' I guess I taught him one good lesson, though. I told him he was just the kind of person I should expect the Garter Snake to like, and that I wished them much joy together, but that I didn't want anything to do with them."
"No, she mightn't."
"""Tell me the way, then,"" she said, ""and I'll search you out; that surely I may get leave to do."""
"""Yes,"" she might do that, he said; ""but there was no way to that place. It lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and thither she'd never find her way."""
"So next morning, when she woke up, both Prince and castle were gone, and then she lay on a little green patch, in the midst of the gloomy thick wood, and by her side lay the same bundle of rags she had brought with her from her old home."
"So when she had rubbed the sleep out of her eyes, and wept till she was tired, she set out on her way, and walked many, many days, till she came to a lofty crag. Under it sat an old hag, and played with a gold apple which she tossed about. Here the lassie asked if she knew the way to the Prince, who lived with his step-mother in the Castle, that lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and who was to marry the Princess with a nose three ells long."
"""How did you come to know about him?"" asked the old hag; ""but maybe you are the lassie who ought to have had him?"""
"Yes, she was."
"""So, so; it's you, is it?"" said the old hag. ""Well, all I know about him is, that he lives in the castle that lies East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and thither you'll come, late or never; but still you may have the loan of my horse, and on him you can ride to my next neighbour. Maybe she'll be able to tell you; and when you get there, just give the horse a switch under the left ear, and beg him to be off home; and, stay, this gold apple you may take with you."""
"So she got upon the horse, and rode a long, long time, till she came to another crag, under which sat another old hag, with a gold carding-comb. Here the lassie asked if she knew the way to the castle that lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and she answered, like the first old hag, that she knew nothing about it, except it was east of the sun and west of the moon."
"""And thither you'll come, late or never, but you shall have the loan of my horse to my next neighbour; maybe she'll tell you all about it; and when you get there, just switch the horse under the left ear, and beg him to be off home."""
"And this old hag gave her the golden carding-comb; it might be she'd find some use for it, she said. So the lassie got up on the horse, and rode a far, far way, and a weary time; and so at last she came to another great crag, under which sat another old hag, spinning with a golden spinning-wheel. Her, too, she asked if she knew the way to the Prince, and where the castle was that lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon. So it was the same thing over again."
"""Maybe it's you who ought to have had the Prince?"" said the old hag."
"Yes, it was."
"But she, too, didn't know the way a bit better than the other two."
"""East of the sun and west of the moon it was,"" she knew that was all."
"""And thither you'll come, late or never; but I'll lend you my horse, and then I think you'd best ride to the East Wind and ask him; maybe he knows those parts, and can blow you thither. But when you get to him, you need only give the horse a switch under the left ear, and he'll trot home of himself."""
"And so, too, she gave her the gold spinning-wheel. ""Maybe you'll find a use for it,"" said the old hag."
"Then on she rode many many days, a weary time, before she got to the East Wind's house, but at last she did reach it, and then she asked the East Wind if he could tell her the way to the Prince who dwelt east of the sun and west of the moon. Yes, the East Wind had often heard tell of it, the Prince and the castle, but he couldn't tell the way, for he had never blown so far."
"""But, if you will, I'll go with you to my brother the West Wind, maybe he knows, for he's much stronger. So, if you will just get on my back, I'll carry you thither."""
"Yes, she got on his back, and I should just think they went briskly along."
"So when they got there, they went into the West Wind's house, and the East Wind said the lassie he had brought was the one who ought to have had the Prince who lived in the castle East of the Sun and West of the Moon; and so she had set out to seek him, and how he had come with her, and would be glad to know if the West Wind knew how to get to the castle."
"""Nay,"" said the West Wind, ""so far I've never blown; but if you will, I'll go with you to our brother the South Wind, for he's much stronger than either of us, and he has flapped his wings far and wide. Maybe he'll tell you. You can get on my back, and I'll carry you to him."""
"Yes! she got on his back, and so they travelled to the South Wind, and weren't so very long on the way, I should think."
"When they got there, the West Wind asked him if he could tell her the way to the castle that lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon, for it was she who ought to have had the Prince who lived there."
"""You don't say so! That's she, is it?"" said the South Wind."
"""Well, I have blustered about in most places in my time, but so far have I never blown; but if you will, I'll take you to my brother the North Wind; he is the oldest and strongest of the whole lot of us, and if he don't know where it is, you'll never find any one in the world to tell you. You can get on my back, and I'll carry you thither."""
"Yes! she got on his back, and away he went from his house at a fine rate. And this time, too, she wasn't long on her way."
"So when they got to the North Wind's house, he was so wild and cross, cold puffs came from him a long way off."
"""BLAST YOU BOTH, WHAT DO YOU WANT?"" he roared out to them ever so far off, so that it struck them with an icy shiver."
"""Well,"" said the South Wind, ""you needn't be so foul-mouthed, for here I am, your brother, the South Wind, and here is the lassie who ought to have had the Prince who dwells in the castle that lies East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and now she wants to ask you if you ever were there, and can tell her the way, for she would be so glad to find him again."""
"When he said this, all the Workers smiled, and even the Queen-Mother had to turn away her head. The Drones looked as solemn as possible. It would not do for them to laugh at their brother. They did not want him to laugh at them when they made excuses for staying at home. They even pretended not to hear one of the Workers when she said that it was funny how some people couldn't use their wings if one of their feet hurt them."
"""Yes,"" said another Worker, ""and it is funny, too, how some people can get along very well on three legs when they have to, while others are too helpless to do anything unless they can use the whole six."""
"The Drones began to talk together. ""I think that the whole swarm should fly at the Kingbird and sting him and drive him away,"" said one. ""There is no sense in allowing him to perch outside our home and catch us as we pass in and out. I say that we should make war upon him!"" He looked very fierce as he spoke, buzzing and twitching his feelers at every step."
"""Exactly!"" cried another Drone. ""If I had a sting, I would lead the attack. As it is, I may be useful in guarding the comb. It is a great pity that Drones have no stings."" You would have thought, to hear him speak, that if he had been given a sting like those of the Workers, not all the Bees in the tree could keep him from fighting."
"While the Drones were talking about war, some of the Workers sent to their Queen for advice. ""Tell us,"" they said, ""how to drive away the Kingbird. Should we try to sting him? You know it kills a Bee to sting anybody, and we don't want to if we can help it, yet we will if you say so."""
"The Queen-Mother shook her head. ""You must not bother me about such things,"" she said. ""I have all that I can do to get the eggs ready, and you must look after the swarm. Nobody else can do my work, and I have no time to do yours."" As she spoke, she finished the one hundred and seventeenth egg of that day's lot, and before night came she would probably have laid more than a thousand, so you can see she was quite right when she said she had no time for other things."
"This left the Workers to plan for themselves, and they agreed that a number of them should fly out together and see where the Kingbird was."
"Then they could decide about attacking him later. When one gave the signal, they dashed out as nearly together as possible."
"After the Workers returned with honey and pollen, the Drones crowded around them, asking questions. ""Where is he? What does he look like? Did he try to catch you?"" The Workers would not answer them, and said: ""Go and find out for yourself. We all came back alive."" Then they went about their work as usual."
"""I don't see how they dared to go,"" said a very young Bee who was just out of her cocoon and was still too weak to fly."
"""Pooh!"" said the big Drone. ""You wouldn't see me hanging around this tree if I were not lame."""
"""There is no use in stopping work even if you are scared,"" said one of the Workers. She smiled as she spoke, and whispered something to the Queen-Mother as she passed her. The Queen-Mother smiled also."
"""Why don't you Drones go for honey?"" she said. ""You must be getting very hungry."""
"""We don't feel very well,"" they answered. ""Perhaps it would be better for our health if we were to keep quiet for a while and save our strength. We will lunch off some of the honey in the comb if we need food."""
"""Not a bit of it!"" exclaimed the Workers. ""Stay in the tree if you want to for your health, but don't you dare touch the honey we have gathered for winter, when the day is clear and bright like this."" And whenever a Drone tried to get food from the comb they drove him away."
"The poor Drones had a hard day of it, and at night they were so hungry they could hardly sleep. The next morning they peeped out, and then rushed away to the flowers for their breakfast. They stayed out all day, and when they returned at night they rushed swiftly into the tree again."
"""There!"" they said; ""we escaped the Kingbird."""
"""What Kingbird?"" asked a Worker."
"""The one who was there yesterday,"" answered the Drones. ""Has he been back to-day?"""
"""There was no Kingbird near the tree yesterday,"" said the Worker."
"""What!"" cried the Drones."
"""No,"" said the Queen-Mother, ""I was mistaken when I thought I heard him."
"The Workers told me after they had been out for honey. Perhaps they forgot to tell you."""
"But her eyes twinkled as she spoke, and all the Workers smiled, and for some reason the Drones did not know what to say."
THE STORY OF THE COW BIRD'S EGG
"On the edge of the forest next to the meadow, a pair of young Goldfinches were about to begin housekeeping. They were a handsome couple, and the birds who were already nesting near by were much pleased to see them tree-hunting there."
"Mr. Goldfinch was a fine, cheerful little fellow, every feather of whose black and yellow coat was always well oiled and lying in its proper place. His wife was dressed in a dull, greenish brown with a touch of yellow on her breast. ""Bright yellow and black does very well for Mr."
"Goldfinch,"" she would say, ""but for one who has to sit on the nest as long as I shall have to, it would never do. People would see me among the leaves and know just where to find my eggs."""
"Mr. Goldfinch thought that there was never a bird who had a prettier, dearer, or harder-working little wife than he, and he would wonder how he was ever happy before he knew her. That is a way that people have of forgetting the days that are past; and the truth is that Mr. Goldfinch had made fun of the Robins and other birds all spring, because they had to build nests and hunt worms for their babies, while he had nothing to do but sing and sleep and feed himself. In those days the Robins used to call after him as he flew away, ""Silly fellow! Silly fellow! Silly!"""
They knew that there is something sweeter in life than just taking good care of one's self.
"One afternoon Mr. Goldfinch saw a tiny green-brown bird on a sweetbriar bush, and as he watched her he thought her the most beautiful creature he had ever seen. She had such a dainty way of picking out the seeds, and gave such graceful hops from one twig to another. Then Mr. Goldfinch fluffed up his feathers and swelled out his throat and sang her such songs as he had never sung before. He did not want her to speak to anybody else, and yet he could not help her doing so, for Goldfinches always go together in crowds until they have homes of their own, and at this time they were having concerts every morning. He showed her where the finest dandelion seeds could be found, and one bright and sunshiny day she became Mrs. Goldfinch, and they went together to find a place for their home."
"Once upon a time, a tiger was caught in a trap. He tried in vain to get out through the bars, and rolled and bit with rage and grief when he failed."
"By chance a poor Brahman came by. ""Let me out of this cage, oh pious one!"" cried the tiger."
"""Nay, my friend,"" replied the Brahman mildly, ""you would probably eat me if I did."""
"""Not at all!"" swore the tiger with many oaths; ""on the contrary, I should be for ever grateful, and serve you as a slave!"""
"Now when the tiger sobbed and sighed and wept and swore, the pious Brahman's heart softened, and at last he consented to open the door of the cage. Out popped the tiger, and, seizing the poor man, cried, ""What a fool you are! What is to prevent my eating you now, for after being cooped up so long I am just terribly hungry!"""
In vain the Brahman pleaded for his life; the most he could gain was a promise to abide by the decision of the first three things he chose to question as to the justice of the tiger's action.
"So the Brahman first asked a pipal tree what it thought of the matter, but the pipal tree replied coldly, ""What have you to complain about? Don't I give shade and shelter to every one who passes by, and don't they in return tear down my branches to feed their cattle? Don't whimper be a man!"""
"Then the Brahman, sad at heart, went further afield till he saw a buffalo turning a well-wheel; but he fared no better from it, for it answered, ""You are a fool to expect gratitude! Look at me! Whilst I gave milk they fed me on cotton-seed and oil-cake, but now I am dry they yoke me here, and give me refuse as fodder!"""
"The Brahman, still more sad, asked the road to give him its opinion."
"""My dear sir,"" said the road, ""how foolish you are to expect anything else! Here am I, useful to everybody, yet all, rich and poor, great and small, trample on me as they go past, giving me nothing but the ashes of their pipes and the husks of their grain!"""
"On this the Brahman turned back sorrowfully, and on the way he met a jackal, who called out, ""Why, what's the matter, Mr. Brahman? You look as miserable as a fish out of water!"""
"The Brahman told him all that had occurred. ""How very confusing!"" said the jackal, when the recital was ended; ""would you mind telling me over again, for everything has got so mixed up?"""
"The Brahman told it all over again, but the jackal shook his head in a distracted sort of way, and still could not understand."
"""It's very odd,"" said he, sadly, ""but it all seems to go in at one ear and out at the other! I will go to the place where it all happened, and then perhaps I shall be able to give a judgment."""
"So they returned to the cage, by which the tiger was waiting for the Brahman, and sharpening his teeth and claws."
"""You've been away a long time!"" growled the savage beast, ""but now let us begin our dinner."""
"""Our dinner!"" thought the wretched Brahman, as his knees knocked together with fright; ""what a remarkably delicate way of putting it!"""
"""Give me five minutes, my lord!"" he pleaded, ""in order that I may explain matters to the jackal here, who is somewhat slow in his wits."""
"The tiger consented, and the Brahman began the whole story over again, not missing a single detail, and spinning as long a yarn as possible."
"""Oh, my poor brain! oh, my poor brain!"" cried the jackal, wringing its paws. ""Let me see! how did it all begin? You were in the cage, and the tiger came walking by  """
"""Pooh!"" interrupted the tiger, ""what a fool you are! I was in the cage."""
"""Of course!"" cried the jackal, pretending to tremble with fright; ""yes! I was in the cage no I wasn't dear! dear! where are my wits?"
"Let me see the tiger was in the Brahman, and the cage came walking by  no, that's not it, either! Well, don't mind me, but begin your dinner, for I shall never understand!"""
"""Yes, you shall!"" returned the tiger, in a rage at the jackal's stupidity; ""I'll make you understand! Look here I am the tiger  """
"""Yes, my lord!"""
"""And that is the Brahman  """
"""Yes, my lord!"""
"""And that is the cage  """
"""Yes, my lord!"""
"""And I was in the cage do you understand?"""
"""Yes no   Please, my lord  """
"""He just was a chap to ride!"" they said; ""so grand a knight isn't to be found in the wide world."""
"""Oh!"" said Boots, ""I should so like to have seen him, that I should."""
"""Ah!"" said his brothers, ""his mail shone a deal brighter than the glowing coals which you are always poking and digging at; nasty dirty beast that you are."""
"Next day all the knights and princes were to pass before the king and the Princess it was too late to do so the night before, I suppose that he who had the gold apple might bring it forth; but one came after another, first the Princes, and then the knights, and still no one could show the gold apple."
"""Well,"" said the king, ""some one must have it, for it was something we all saw with our own eyes, how a man came and rode up and bore it off."""
"So he commanded that every man who was in the kingdom should come up to the palace and see if they could show the apple. Well, they all came one after another, but no one had the golden apple, and after a long time the two brothers of Boots came. They were the last of all, so the king asked them if there was no one else in the kingdom who hadn't come."
"""Oh, yes,"" said they; ""we have a brother, but he never carried off the golden apple. He hasn't stirred out of the dusthole on any of the three days."""
"""Never mind that,"" said the king; ""he may as well come up to the palace like the rest."""
So Boots had to go up to the palace.
"""How now,"" said the king; ""have you got the golden apple? Speak out!"""
"""Yes, I have,"" said Boots; ""here is the first, and here is the second, and here is the third too;"" and with that he pulled all three golden apples out of his pocket, and at the same time threw off his sooty rags, and stood before them in his gleaming golden mail."
"""Yes!"" said the king; ""you shall have my daughter, and half my kingdom, for you well deserve both her and it."""
"So they got ready for the wedding, and Boots got the Princess to wife, and there was great merry-making at the bridal-feast, you may fancy, for they could all be merry though they couldn't ride up the Hill of Glass; and all I can say is, if they haven't left off their merry-making yet, why, they're still at it."
THE WIDOW'S SON
"Once on a time there was a poor, poor Widow, who had an only Son."
"She dragged on with the boy till he had been confirmed, and then she said she couldn't feed him any longer, he must just go out and earn his own bread. So the lad wandered out into the world, and when he had walked a day or so, a strange man met him."
"""Whither away?"" asked the man."
"""Whither away?"" asked the man.]"
"""Oh, I'm going out into the world to try and get a place,"" said the lad."
"""Will you come and serve me?"" said the man."
"""Oh, yes; just as soon you as any one else,"" said the lad."
"""Well, you'll have a good place with me,"" said the man; ""for you'll only have to keep me company, and do nothing at all else beside."""
"So the lad stopped with him, and lived on the fat of the land, both in meat and drink, and had little or nothing to do; but he never saw a living soul in that man's house."
So one day the man said:
"""Now, I'm going off for eight days, and that time you'll have to spend here all alone; but you must not go into any one of these four rooms here. If you do, I'll take your life when I come back."""
"""No,"" said the lad, he'd be sure not to do that. But when the man had been gone three or four days, the lad couldn't bear it any longer, but went into the first room, and when he got inside he looked round, but he saw nothing but a shelf over the door where a bramble-bush rod lay."
"Well, indeed! thought the lad; a pretty thing to forbid my seeing this."
"So when the eight days were out, the man came home, and the first thing he said was:"
"""You haven't been into any of these rooms, of course."""
"""No, no; that I haven't,"" said the lad."
"""I'll soon see that,"" said the man, and went at once into the room where the lad had been."
"""He's going to take us home,"" said Jane. ""Oh, he is a good dragon. I am glad!"""
"George was rather glad too, though neither of the children felt at all sure of their welcome, especially as their feet were wet, and they were bringing a strange dragon home with them."
"They went very fast, because dragons can go uphill as easily as down."
"You would not understand why if I told you because you are only in long division at present; yet if you want me to tell you, so that you can show off to other children, I will. It is because dragons can get their tails into the fourth dimension and hold on there, and when you can do that everything else is easy."
"The dragon went very fast, only stopping to eat the collector and the sportsman, who were still struggling to go up the slide vainly, because they had no tails, and had never even heard of the fourth dimension."
"When the dragon got to the end of the slide he crawled very slowly across the dark field beyond the field where there was a bonfire, next to the next-door garden at Forest Hill."
"He went slower and slower, and in the bonfire field he stopped altogether, and because the Arctic regions had not got down so far as that, and because the bonfire was very hot, the dragon began to melt and melt and melt and before the children knew what he was doing they found themselves sitting in a large pool of water, and their boots were as wet as wet, and there was not a bit of dragon left!"
So they went indoors.
"Of course some grown-up or other noticed at once that the boots of George and Jane were wet and muddy, and that they had both been sitting down in a very damp place, so they were sent to bed immediately."
"It was long past their time, anyhow."
"Now, if you are of an inquiring mind not at all a nice thing in a little child who reads fairy tales you will want to know how it is that since the sealskin dwarfs have all been killed, and the fires all been let out, the Aurora Borealis shines, on cold nights, as brightly as ever."
"My dear, I do not know! I am not too proud to own that there are some things I know nothing about and this is one of them. But I do know that whoever has lighted those fires again, it is certainly not the sealskin dwarfs. They were all eaten by moths and motheaten things are of no use, even to light fires!"
V. The Island of the Nine Whirlpools
"The dark arch that led to the witch's cave was hung with a black-and-yellow fringe of live snakes. As the Queen went in, keeping carefully in the middle of the arch, all the snakes lifted their wicked, flat heads and stared at her with their wicked, yellow eyes. You know it is not good manners to stare, even at Royalty, except of course for cats. And the snakes had been so badly brought up that they even put their tongues out at the poor lady. Nasty, thin, sharp tongues they were too."
"Now, the Queen's husband was, of course, the King. And besides being a King he was an enchanter, and considered to be quite at the top of his profession, so he was very wise, and he knew that when Kings and Queens want children, the Queen always goes to see a witch. So he gave the Queen the witch's address, and the Queen called on her, though she was very frightened and did not like it at all. The witch was sitting by a fire of sticks, stirring something bubbly in a shiny copper cauldron."
"""What do you want, my dear?"" she said to the Queen."
"""Oh, if you please,"" said the Queen, ""I want a baby a very nice one. We don't want any expense spared. My husband said """
"""Oh, yes,"" said the witch. ""I know all about him. And so you want a child? Do you know it will bring you sorrow?"""
"""It will bring me joy first,"" said the Queen."
"""Great sorrow,"" said the witch."
"""Greater joy,"" said the Queen."
"Then the witch said, ""Well, have your own way. I suppose it's as much as your place is worth to go back without it?"""
"""The King would be very much annoyed,"" said the poor Queen."
"""Well, well,"" said the witch. ""What will you give me for the child?"""
"""Anything you ask for, and all I have,"" said the Queen."
"""Then give me your gold crown."""
The Queen took it off quickly.
"""And your necklace of blue sapphires."""
The Queen unfastened it.
"""And your pearl bracelets."""
The Queen unclasped them.
"The strange rabbit stopped dancing, and came quite close. He came so close this time that his long whiskers brushed the Velveteen Rabbit's ear, and then he wrinkled his nose suddenly and flattened his ears and jumped backwards."
"""He doesn't smell right!"" he exclaimed. ""He isn't a rabbit at all! He isn't real!"""
"""I am Real!"" said the little Rabbit. ""I am Real! The Boy said so!"" And he nearly began to cry."
"Just then there was a sound of footsteps, and the Boy ran past near them, and with a stamp of feet and a flash of white tails the two strange rabbits disappeared."
"""Come back and play with me!"" called the little Rabbit. ""Oh, do come back! I know I am Real!"""
"But there was no answer, only the little ants ran to and fro, and the bracken swayed gently where the two strangers had passed. The Velveteen Rabbit was all alone."
"""Oh, dear!"" he thought. ""Why did they run away like that? Why couldn't they stop and talk to me?"""
"For a long time he lay very still, watching the bracken, and hoping that they would come back. But they never returned, and presently the sun sank lower and the little white moths fluttered out, and the Boy came and carried him home."
"Weeks passed, and the little Rabbit grew very old and shabby, but the Boy loved him just as much. He loved him so hard that he loved all his whiskers off, and the pink lining to his ears turned grey, and his brown spots faded. He even began to lose his shape, and he scarcely looked like a rabbit any more, except to the Boy. To him he was always beautiful, and that was all that the little Rabbit cared about. He didn't mind how he looked to other people, because the nursery magic had made him Real, and when you are Real shabbiness doesn't matter."
"And then, one day, the Boy was ill."
"His face grew very flushed, and he talked in his sleep, and his little body was so hot that it burned the Rabbit when he held him close."
"Strange people came and went in the nursery, and a light burned all night and through it all the little Velveteen Rabbit lay there, hidden from sight under the bedclothes, and he never stirred, for he was afraid that if they found him some one might take him away, and he knew that the Boy needed him."
"It was a long weary time, for the Boy was too ill to play, and the little Rabbit found it rather dull with nothing to do all day long."
"But he snuggled down patiently, and looked forward to the time when the Boy should be well again, and they would go out in the garden amongst the flowers and the butterflies and play splendid games in the raspberry thicket like they used to. All sorts of delightful things he planned, and while the Boy lay half asleep he crept up close to the pillow and whispered them in his ear. And presently the fever turned, and the Boy got better. He was able to sit up in bed and look at picture-books, while the little Rabbit cuddled close at his side. And one day, they let him get up and dress."
"It was a bright, sunny morning, and the windows stood wide open. They had carried the Boy out on to the balcony, wrapped in a shawl, and the little Rabbit lay tangled up among the bedclothes, thinking."
"The Boy was going to the seaside to-morrow. Everything was arranged, and now it only remained to carry out the doctor's orders. They talked about it all, while the little Rabbit lay under the bedclothes, with just his head peeping out, and listened. The room was to be disinfected, and all the books and toys that the Boy had played with in bed must be burnt."
"""Hurrah!"" thought the little Rabbit. ""To-morrow we shall go to the seaside!"" For the boy had often talked of the seaside, and he wanted very much to see the big waves coming in, and the tiny crabs, and the sand castles."
Just then Nana caught sight of him.
"""How about his old Bunny?"" she asked."
"""That?"" said the doctor. ""Why, it's a mass of scarlet fever germs!-Burn it at once. What? Nonsense! Get him a new one. He mustn't have that any more!"""
Anxious Times
"And so the little Rabbit was put into a sack with the old picture-books and a lot of rubbish, and carried out to the end of the garden behind the fowl-house. That was a fine place to make a bonfire, only the gardener was too busy just then to attend to it. He had the potatoes to dig and the green peas to gather, but next morning he promised to come quite early and burn the whole lot."
"That night the Boy slept in a different bedroom, and he had a new bunny to sleep with him. It was a splendid bunny, all white plush with real glass eyes, but the Boy was too excited to care very much about it. For to-morrow he was going to the seaside, and that in itself was such a wonderful thing that he could think of nothing else."
"And while the Boy was asleep, dreaming of the seaside, the little Rabbit lay among the old picture-books in the corner behind the fowl-house, and he felt very lonely. The sack had been left untied, and so by wriggling a bit he was able to get his head through the opening and look out. He was shivering a little, for he had always been used to sleeping in a proper bed, and by this time his coat had worn so thin and threadbare from hugging that it was no longer any protection to him. Near by he could see the thicket of raspberry canes, growing tall and close like a tropical jungle, in whose shadow he had played with the Boy on bygone mornings. He thought of those long sunlit hours in the garden-how happy they were-and a great sadness came over him. He seemed to see them all pass before him, each more beautiful than the other, the fairy huts in the flower-bed, the quiet evenings in the wood when he lay in the bracken and the little ants ran over his paws; the wonderful day when he first knew that he was Real. He thought of the Skin Horse, so wise and gentle, and all that he had told him. Of what use was it to be loved and lose one's beauty and become Real if it all ended like this? And a tear, a real tear, trickled down his little shabby velvet nose and fell to the ground."
"And then a strange thing happened. For where the tear had fallen a flower grew out of the ground, a mysterious flower, not at all like any that grew in the garden. It had slender green leaves the colour of emeralds, and in the centre of the leaves a blossom like a golden cup."
"It was so beautiful that the little Rabbit forgot to cry, and just lay there watching it. And presently the blossom opened, and out of it there stepped a fairy."
"She was quite the loveliest fairy in the whole world. Her dress was of pearl and dew-drops, and there were flowers round her neck and in her hair, and her face was like the most perfect flower of all. And she came close to the little Rabbit and gathered him up in her arms and kissed him on his velveteen nose that was all damp from crying."
"""Little Rabbit,"" she said, ""don't you know who I am?"""
"The Rabbit looked up at her, and it seemed to him that he had seen her face before, but he couldn't think where."
"""I am the nursery magic Fairy,"" she said. ""I take care of all the playthings that the children have loved. When they are old and worn out and the children don't need them any more, then I come and take them away with me and turn them into Real."""
"""Wasn't I Real before?"" asked the little Rabbit."
"""You were Real to the Boy,"" the Fairy said, ""because he loved you. Now you shall be Real to every one."""
"He found the way both dark and unpleasant, but he thought he would go on as long as it became no worse. But all at once he felt ice cold water spouting about his ears; he became frightened to death and began tugging at the rope."
"The lieutenant was the next to try, but it fared no better with him."
"No sooner had he got through the flood of water than he saw a blazing fire yawning beneath him, which so frightened him that he also turned back."
"The soldier then got into the bucket, and down he went through fire and water, right on till he came to the bottom, where it was so pitch dark that he could not see his hand before him. He dared not let go the basket, but went round in a circle, feeling and fumbling about him. At last he discovered a gleam of light far, far away like the dawn of day, and he went on in that direction."
"When he had gone a bit it began to grow light around him, and before long he saw a golden sun rising in the sky and everything around him became as bright and beautiful as if in a fairy world."
"First he came to some cattle, which were so fat that their hides glistened a long way off, and when he had got past them he came to a fine, big palace. He walked through many rooms without meeting anybody. At last he heard the hum of a spinning wheel, and when he entered the room he found the eldest Princess sitting there spinning copper yarn; the room and everything in it was of brightly polished copper."
"""Oh, dear; oh, dear! what are Christian people doing here?"" said the Princess. ""Heaven preserve you! what do you want?"""
"""I want to set you free and get you out of the mountain,"" said the soldier."
"""Pray do not stay. If the troll comes home he will put an end to you at once; he has three heads,"" said she."
"""I do not care if he has four,"" said the soldier. ""I am here, and here I shall remain."""
"""Well, if you will be so headstrong, I must see if I can help you,"""
said the Princess.
She then told him to creep behind the big brewing vat which stood in the front hall; meanwhile she would receive the troll and scratch his heads till he went to sleep.
"""And when I go out and call the hens you must make haste and come in,"""
"she said. ""But you must first try if you can swing the sword which is lying on the table."" No, it was too heavy, he could not even move it."
"He had then to take a strengthening draught from the horn, which hung behind the door; after that he was just able to stir it, so he took another draught, and then he could lift it. At last he took a right, big draught, and he could swing the sword as easily as anything."
All at once the troll came home; he walked so heavily that the palace shook.
"""Ugh, ugh! I smell Christian flesh and blood in my house,"" said he."
"""Yes,"" answered the Princess, ""a raven flew past here just now, and in his beak he had a human bone, which he dropped down the chimney; I threw it out and swept and cleaned up after it, but I suppose it still smells."""
"""So it does,"" said the troll."
"""But come and lie down and I'll scratch your heads,"" said the Princess; ""the smell will be gone by the time you wake."""
"The troll was quite willing, and before long he fell asleep and began snoring. When she saw he was sleeping soundly, she placed some stools and cushions under his heads and went to call the hens. The soldier then stole into the room with the sword, and with one blow cut all the three heads off the troll."
"The Princess was as pleased as a fiddler, and went with the soldier to her sisters, so that he could also set them free. First of all they went across a courtyard and then through many long rooms till they came to a big door."
"""Here you must enter: here she is,"" said the Princess. When he opened the door he found himself in a large hall, where everything was of pure silver; there sat the second sister at a silver spinning-wheel."
"""Oh, dear; oh, dear!"" she said. ""What do you want here?"""
"""I want to set you free from the troll,"" said the soldier."
"""Pray do not stay, but go,"" said the Princess. ""If he finds you here he will take your life on the spot."""
"""That would be awkward that is if I don't take his first,"" said the soldier."
"""Well, since you will stay,"" she said, ""you will have to creep behind the big brewing-vat in the front hall. But you must make haste and come as soon as you hear me calling the hens."""
"First of all he had to try if he was able to swing the troll's sword, which lay on the table; it was much larger and heavier than the first one; he was hardly able to move it. He then took three draughts from the horn and he could then lift it, and when he had taken three more he could handle it as if it were a rolling pin."
"Shortly afterwards he heard a heavy, rumbling noise that was quite terrible, and directly afterwards a troll with six heads came in."
"So the lad did that; but in spite of all the pains he took, he still spilt one drop on the horse's flank. So it became a great deep lake; and because of that one drop, the horse found himself far out in it, but still he swam safe to land. But when the Trolls came to the lake, they lay down to drink it dry; and so they swilled and swilled till they burst."
"""Now we're rid of them,"" said the Horse."
"So when they had gone a long, long while, they came to a green patch in a wood."
"""Now, strip off all your arms,"" said the Horse, ""and only put on your ragged clothes, and take the saddle off me, and let me loose, and hang all my clothing and your arms up inside that great hollow lime-tree yonder. Then make yourself a wig of fir-moss, and go up to the king's palace, which lies close here, and ask for a place."
"Whenever you need me, only come here and shake the bridle, and I'll come to you."""
"Yes! the lad did all his Horse told him, and as soon as ever he put on the wig of moss he became so ugly, and pale, and miserable to look at, no one would have known him again. Then he went up to the king's palace and begged first for leave to be in the kitchen, and bring in wood and water for the cook, but then the kitchen-maid asked him:"
"""Why do you wear that ugly wig? Off with it. I won't have such a fright in here."""
"""No, I can't do that,"" said the lad; ""for I'm not quite right in my head."""
"""Do you think then I'll have you in here about the food,"" cried the cook. ""Away with you to the coachman; you're best fit to go and clean the stable."""
"But when the coachman begged him to take his wig off, he got the same answer, and he wouldn't have him either."
"""You'd best go down to the gardener,"" said he; ""you're best fit to go about and dig in the garden."""
"So he got leave to be with the gardener, but none of the other servants would sleep with him, and so he had to sleep by himself under the steps of the summer-house. It stood upon beams, and had a high staircase. Under that he got some turf for his bed, and there he lay as well as he could."
"So, when he had been some time at the palace, it happened one morning, just as the sun rose, that the lad had taken off his wig, and stood and washed himself, and then he was so handsome, it was a joy to look at him."
"So the Princess saw from her window the lovely gardener's boy, and thought she had never seen any one so handsome. Then she asked the gardener why he lay out there under the steps."
"""Oh,"" said the gardener, ""none of his fellow-servants will sleep with him; that's why."""
"""Let him come up to-night, and lie at the door inside my bedroom, and then they'll not refuse to sleep with him any more,"" said the Princess."
So the gardener told that to the lad.
"""Do you think I'll do any such thing?"" said the lad. ""Why they'd say next there was something between me and the Princess."""
"""Yes,"" said the gardener, ""you've good reason to fear any such thing, you who are so handsome."""
"""Well, well,"" said the lad, ""since it's her will, I suppose I must go."""
"So, when he was to go up the steps in the evening, he tramped and stamped so on the way, that they had to beg him to tread softly lest the King should come to know it. So he came into the Princess' bedroom, lay down, and began to snore at once. Then the Princess said to her maid:"
"""Go gently, and just pull his wig off;"" and she went up to him."
"But just as she was going to whisk it off, he caught hold of it with both hands, and said she should never have it. After that he lay down again, and began to snore. Then the Princess gave her maid a wink, and this time she whisked off the wig; and there lay the lad so lovely, and white and red, just as the Princess had seen him in the morning sun."
After that the lad slept every night in the Princess' bedroom.
"But it wasn't long before the King came to hear how the gardener's lad slept every night in the Princess' bedroom; and he got so wroth he almost took the lad's life. He didn't do that, however, but he threw him into the prison tower; and as for his daughter, he shut her up in her own room, whence she never got leave to stir day or night."
"All that she begged, and all that she prayed, for the lad and herself, was no good. The King was only more wroth than ever."
"Some time after came a war and uproar in the land, and the King had to take up arms against another king who wished to take the kingdom from him. So when the lad heard that, he begged the gaoler to go to the King and ask for a coat of mail and a sword, and for leave to go to the war. All the rest laughed when the gaoler told his errand, and begged the King to let him have an old worn-out suit, that they might have the fun of seeing such a wretch in battle. So he got that, and an old broken-down hack besides, which went upon three legs, and dragged the fourth after it."
"Then they went out to meet the foe; but they hadn't got far from the palace before the lad got stuck fast in a bog with his hack. There he sat and dug his spurs in, and cried, ""Gee up! gee up!"" to his hack."
"And all the rest had their fun out of this, and laughed, and made game of the lad as they rode past him. But they were scarcely gone, before he ran to the lime-tree, threw on his coat of mail, and shook the bridle, and there came the Horse in a trice, and said: ""Do now your best, and I'll do mine."""
"But when the lad came up the battle had begun, and the King was in a sad pinch; but no sooner had the lad rushed into the thick of it than the foe was beaten back, and put to flight. The King and his men wondered and wondered who it could be who had come to help them, but none of them got so near him as to be able to talk to him, and as soon as the fight was over he was gone. When they went back, there sat the lad still in the bog, and dug his spurs into his three-legged hack, and they all laughed again."

"Senator Crane put that paper aside and looked at the next. This one,"
"more so than all the rest, was completely factual:"
SENATOR CRANE DELUGED WITH WIRES
FROM HOME
CONSTITUENTS CLAIM WASHINGTON RIDICULE
HEAPED ON SENATOR REFLECTS AGAINST STATE.
Crane dropped the paper and got up from the desk.
That son-of-a-bitch Taber was to blame for this. Shaping
up a goddamn hoax and feeding it out piecemeal. By
God--!
"He went to the desk and dialed, and when the answer came he said,"
"""Halliday? Senator Crane here. I want to have a little talk with you"
about that damned tape. It's pretty obvious now that Taber planted it in
"a deliberate attempt to ... What's that? An appointment! Why, goddamn"
"it, who the hell do you think you are?.... Fifteen minutes next"
"Wednesday? You're talking to a United States Senator--"""
But Crane was no longer talking to Halliday. He had hung up.
"Crane dialed another number. A pleasant female voice said, ""Matthew"
"Porter's office."""
"""This is Senator Crane. Put Porter on."""
"""Yes--Cagliari is _so-so_--Cagliari is very fair,"" said the black cap."
"""_Cagliari è discreto._"" He was evidently proud of it."
"""And is Mandas nice?"" asked the q-b."
"""In what way nice?"" they asked, with immense sarcasm."
"""Is there anything to see?"""
"""Hens,"" said the _maialino_ briefly. They all bristled when one asked if"
Mandas was nice.
"""What does one do here?"" asked the q-b."
"""_Niente!_ At Mandas one does _nothing_. At Mandas one goes to bed when"
"it's dark, like a chicken. At Mandas one walks down the road like a pig"
that is going nowhere. At Mandas a goat understands more than the
"inhabitants understand. At Mandas one needs socialism...."""
They all cried out at once. Evidently Mandas was more than flesh and
blood could bear for another minute to these three conspirators.
"""Then you are very bored here?"" say I."
"""Yes."""
And the quiet intensity of that naked yes spoke more than volumes.
"""You would like to be in Cagliari?"""
"""Yes."""
"""I've found a certain part of those brains developed in a peculiar"
"way--"""
"Taber smiled. ""You're sure of that?"""
"""Well ... that's my theory. It would appear logical that--"""
"Taber leaned forward suddenly and extended his glass, the grin on his"
"face showing some genuine humor. ""Let's have another drink, Doctor. Then"
"I'll go. I love the factual way this Scotch of yours hits my stomach."""

"Frank Corson entered the office of Wilson Maynard, Superintendent of"
Park Hill Hospital. Maynard looked out over the tops of his
"old-fashioned pince-nez glasses and said, ""Oh, Doctor Corson. You phoned"
"for a chat."""
It was the rather pompous superintendent's way of saying he was happy to
give Frank Corson a little time. He considered all the doctors and
"nurses at Park Hill his ""boys and girls,"" and he did the ""father"" bit"
very well.
"""Yes, I--"""
"Maynard peered even harder. ""You don't look well, Frank. Pale. You've"
"been working too hard."""
"""Show-down."""
"""Cut!"" once more peremptorily from Rance; and then, when she had cut,"
"one question more: ""Best two out of three?"""
"""Best two out of three."" Swift, staccato sentences, like the rapid"
"crossing of swords, the first preliminary interchange of strokes before"
the true duel begins.
"Rance dealt the cards. Before either looked at them, he glanced across"
"at the Girl and asked scornfully, perhaps enviously:"
"""What do you see in him?"""
"""What do you see in me?"" she flashed back instantly, as she picked up"
"her cards; and then: ""What have you got?"""
"""King high,"" declared the gambler."
"""King high here,"" echoed the Girl."
"""Jack next,"" and he showed his hand."
"""Queen next,"" and the Girl showed hers."
"""You've got it,"" conceded the gambler, easily. Then, in another tone,"
"""but you're making a mistake--"""
"""If I am, it's my mistake! Cut!"""
"Rance cut the cards. The Girl dealt them steadily. Then,"
"GEORGE.  I tell you plainly, as a man of the world, I don't believe"
"in the guide, philosopher and friend business."
CLARE.  Thank you.
A silence.  CLARE suddenly clasps her hands behind her head.
CLARE.  Let me go!  You'd be much happier with any other woman.
GEORGE.  Clare!
CLARE.  I believe--I'm sure I could earn my living.  Quite serious.
GEORGE.  Are you mad?
CLARE.  It has been done.
Moulton was a handsome man of past fifty with a youthful face against
"his iron gray hair and mustache, well dressed, genial, a man who seemed"
keenly in love with the good things of life.
"“It is rumored,” began Kennedy, “that an attempt was made on your safe"
here at the office last night.”
"“Yes,” he admitted, taking off his glasses and polishing them"
"carefully. “I suppose there is no need of concealment, especially as I"
hear that a somewhat similar attempt was made on the safe of my friend
Herman Schloss in Maiden Lane.”
“You lost nothing?”
Moulton put his glasses on and looked Kennedy in the face frankly.
"There was the upflashing of a sword, and a hoarse challenge frightened"
the night.
Giovanni Frangipani saw a furious face glaring dead white from under
the shadow of a shield.
"He stopped in his onward rush, blinked at the duke as one gone mad."
"""Damnation, what have we here?"""
"""By the love of God, I have you now!"""
"""Fool, are you mad?"""
"The hoarse voice echoed him, the eyes flashed fire."
"""Guard, ravisher,--guard!"""
"""Ten thousand devils! Who are you?"""
"""Your obedient servant,--the Duke of Spoleto!"""
The Frangipani growled like a trapped bear.
"He raised his sword, put forward his shield."
"""On with you, dog!"" he roared. ""Join your wanton under the sod!"""
"""Ha, say you so?"" cried the duke, closing in."
"Their swords flashed, yelped, twisted in the air. A down cut hewed the"
dexter cantrel from the Frangipani's shield. His face with a gashed
manner that he was different from the others.
“You are Jack Bosworth?” he asked.
"“That’s my name,” replied the boy."
“You are here on a mission for your father?”
“I am here on a hunting trip.”
"“With business on the side, eh?”"
"“No business at all,” replied Jack."
“We know better than that!” the stranger answered.
“What do you want of us?” asked Jack.
"“We want information now in your possession,” answered the fellow,"
looking Jack sharply in the eyes.
“What kind of information?”
“We want to know where certain documents are.”
"“You’ll have to ask some one else, then.”"
“We are certain that you have the information we require.”
"“If I had,” Jack answered, “you never would get it from me.”"
"“You will gain nothing by being obstinate,” the fellow said. “Remember"
"man who does not play whist lays up a sad old age for himself.” And,"
"turning on his heel impatiently, “The devil take the man!” said he, and"
walked away.
"Ffolliott espying the two newly-arrived ladies across the room, made"
his way to them:
"“Do you know, Miss Foljambe Pfinch,” he said--“I feel such an ass; they"
told me it was a--fancy--dress--affair.”
The lorgnettes were turned upon him:
"“It’s that ridiculous Mr. Ffolliott,” said she; and laughed"
immoderately.
"Ffolliott sighed, and turned away:"
"“Everybody seems to think I am an ass to-night,” he said wearily. “Oh,"
there’s Fosse. I don’t like Fosse--but I’ll talk to _him_. No--he’s
"talking to another man. I think I’ll go home. No, I won’t, I’ll sit"
down.”
He sat down.
"“Every fellow does something idiotic in his life,” he said."
He watched Fosse button-hole Gomme; and he saw Gomme’s lips smile
"amusedly as he gazed at the floor, listening to him."
He bent all his attention to hear what passed between the two.
"“Now, you know, Mr. Gomme,” said the fussy little man--“in"
"before."""
"""No high words passed between you?"""
"""None."""
"""And nothing that you told her caused her any sudden grief?  Are you"
"quite certain of this?"" he asked, looking at me very fixedly through his"
glasses.
"""I made one observation which certainly caused her surprise,"" I"
"admitted.  ""Nothing else."""
"""Was it only surprise?"" he asked very calmly."
"""Surprise mingled with fear."""
"""Ah!"" he ejaculated, as though obtaining some intelligence by this"
"admission of mine.  ""And may I not know the nature of the information"
"you gave her?"""
"""No, Dick,"" I responded.  ""It is a secret--her secret."""
He was silent.
"""You refuse to tell me?"" he said disappointedly."
"""I am unable,"" I replied."
"""And if I judge rightly, it is this secret which has parted you?"""
"""No, it is not,"" I answered.  ""That's the most curious part of the whole"
"""Wait, they're after me, Captain; it's the Port Townsend police, and if"
"you let them aboard they'll take me off."""
"""What makes you think so?"" demanded Peasley."
"""Ask them."""
"Turning, the skipper bellowed down the gleaming electric pathway, ""Who"
"are you?"""
"""Police! We want to come aboard."""
"""What did I tell you?"" cried Emerson."
"Once more the Captain shouted: ""What do you want?"""
"""One of your passengers--Emerson. Heave to. You're passing us."""
"""That's bloody hard luck, Mr. Emerson; I can't help myself,"" the"
Captain declared. But again Boyd blocked him as he started for the
telegraph.
"""I won't stand it, sir. It's a conspiracy to ruin me."""
"""But, my dear young man--"""
"""Don't touch that instrument!"""
"From the launch came cries of growing vehemence, and a startled murmur"
of voices rose from somewhere in the darkness of the deck beneath.
“Coleman. He lives—”
“I know. Au revoir!” And the girls were alone.
"“There!” exclaimed Miss Decker, “we have got rid of him. Now for the"
"others. You slip upstairs, and I’ll dispose of them one by one. You are"
taken suddenly ill. Teddy will not be back for an hour. Dr. Coleman has
moved.”

"A lamp burned in the sea-room, and the two girls were sitting in their"
evening gowns before a bright log fire. Miss Decker was in white this
time—an elaborate French concoction of embroidered muslin which made
her look like an expensive fashion plate. Jessica wore a low-cut black
"crêpe, above which she rose like carved ivory and brass. The snakes"
to-night were held in place by diamond hair-pins that glittered like
baleful eyes. In her lap sparkled four rings.
"“What shall I do?” she exclaimed. “If my life depended upon it, I could"
"Quilliam O’Flaherty stooping down in confusion to search for the hat,"
she kicked him violently behind.
"There was a roar of laughter from the students seated round about, and"
"they tapped the handles of their knives upon the tables, singing:"
"“Opera-bouffe, bouffe, bouffe! Opera-bouffe, bouffe, bouffe!"
Hey-hey-hey! bouffe-bouffe-bouffe!”
"Then the girl flogged Quilliam with a horse-whip, thrice:"
Once for France.
Once for womanhood.
And once because she liked it.
The whip whistled.
It was said that he had been seen to strike at her--but she parried the
"blow with her left, and countered between his eyes with the butt-end of"
the whip--which was loaded.
He fell.
It was homeric.
"It was at this stage, so the scandal went, that he scrambled under a"
table; but she lugged at his collar to get him out; and as he clung
to the leg of the table she gripped him by the moustache so that she
pulled off one side of it.
"and a little below the forty-five latitude ring?"""
"""Yes."""
It was a small round disc no more than an inch in diameter.
"""We think that may be a response."""
"Wilson said, ""You mean a target? Possibly one of the lifeships?"""
"""Yes."""
"""I'll have a scooter go out and see. What's its spacial position?"""
"The tech took another look. ""I'd say eighty-one plus longitude and"
"forty-three latitude."""
"""From what?"" demanded Wilson."
"""From ship's axis, sir."""
"""Distance?"""
"""Oh, about half a parsec."""
"Wilson groaned. ""Haven't you determined any spacial attitude?"""
"""Attitude, sir?"""
"""The angle of the ship's axis with respect to the stellar positions."
So you've a blotch out there at half a parsec. It's an inch or so in
diameter. Have one of your juniors run off some trig on the calculator
withering contempt.
"""I don't know Latin,"" said the poor second mate."
"""And who expected it of you?"" asked the skipper.  ""It means that"
things are to go on as they was afore they come:
"""----resume the _statues quo_, and don't stand no hargument.  You are"
"to tell 'em it will be considered an unfriendly hact, and that we 'as"
cleared for haction in consequence of not believing them such cowards
"as to quit.  But quit they must, and no mistake, or we resort without"
delay to the arbitrage and general haverage of war.  Given this day
"on board the British barque _Potluck_ by me,"
"""CAPTAIN ABEDNEGO JONES."""
"""First rate!"" said the crew.  ""That'll give 'em the jumps."""
"""And how am I to translate it?"" asked the miserable Simcox."
"""That's your look-out,"" said the Guffin, with a hiccup.  ""Shall I"
"keep a dog and bark myself?  Now, 'urry and get it hover.  And let"
"hevery one 'ave a weapon, 'andspikes and belayin' pins.  Now go,"
"Simcox!"""
"""Hart, come along with me,"" said Simcox."
"And as the ""old man"" was engaged in keeping his balance, he made no"
objection.
"happened here, and we want your assistance."""
"In an instant he became grave, for I suppose my tone showed him that I"
was in no humour for joking.
"""What's the nature of the affair?"" he asked."
"""Death,"" I replied seriously.  ""A lady here--a friend of mine--has died"
"mysteriously."""
"""A mystery--eh?"" he exclaimed, instantly interested.  ""Tell me about"
"it."""
"""This place,"" I replied, ""belongs to the Countess de Foville, a lady"
"whom I knew well when I was at the Brussels Embassy, and it is her"
"daughter Yolande who has been found dead in this room this evening."""
"""Yolande de Foville!"" he repeated, with knit brows.  ""She was a friend"
"of yours once, if I mistake not?"" he added, looking me straight in the"
face.
"""Yes, Dick, she was,"" I responded.  ""I told you of her long ago."""
"""You loved her once?"""
"""Yes,"" I answered with difficulty, ""I loved her once."""
"""And how did the unfortunate affair occur?"" he asked, folding his arms"

A silence ensued. Then Stone said:

we've got into space for you. Ship should be along in another hour or

"""Yeah--thanks, Admiral Stone. And the joke was funny, at least the"

"""He fell off."""
How tired Solem was and drenched to the skin! But what could we do? Rush
up the mountainside and look at the accident too?
"""Can't he walk?"" somebody asked."
"""No, he's dead,"" said Solem, looking from one to another of us as though"

A few more questions and answers. Josephine was already halfway across the
field; she was going to the village to telephone for the doctor.

"""I agree. We've definitely got a situation here."""
He glanced around to see the four _Mino-gumi kobun _poised in the

Novosty still looked stunned. The range of options was rapidly

“Surely. I’ll get it. The wall safe is in Lynn’s room. I shall probably

An hour after he'd finished delivering his speech on the floor of the
"Senate, Crane held a press conference in one of Washington's most"
"important hotels. The place was crowded. He stood on a platform, looked"
"out over a sea of heads, and pointed at an upraised hand for the first"

When he came out with a cloth he went ashore and stumbled up the

Jones nodded.

And in the morning came along two policemen on their way to the beats

"sprawled, asleep, on a bench. They stopped and gazed upon it."
"“It’s Dopy Mike,” said one. “He hits the pipe every night. Park bum for"

The other policeman stooped and looked at something crumpled and crisp

"Looking at Alice thoughtfully, Andrews got up and began to rummage"
through a few lockers. Eventually he found a blanket and brought it to
her.

"what I was after. Now, Miss Hemingway, if you'll stretch out, I'll tuck"
"you in, and you can get some shut-eye."""
"""That I can use,"" she said honestly."
"The blanket felt good. So did his hands, smoothing out the blanket, but"
being carefully tender and proper. Andrews was a smooth operator of
many years' experience.
Eventually she slept.

pipe.
"“Hallo, John! I did n't know you were in front. Why did n't you tell me?"
"It's going splendidly, is n't it?”"
He glowed with the actor's excited delight in an audience's enthusiastic
"reception of a new play. His glow sat rather oddly upon him, for he was"
"made up as a decrepit old man, with bald wig, and heavy, blue patches"
beneath his eyes.
"“No, I'm not in front,” said John."
"“I see now,” smiled Herold, glancing at his friend's loose tweed suit."
No clothes morning or evening ever fitted Risca. Herold called him “The
Tailors' Terror.”

"helplessly on top of him, while the space ship bounced up twenty"

Kennedy entered. But through the door which he left ajar I could hear
what passed.

"He broke off, and I gathered that her pale face and agitated manner"
told him that she knew already.

It was all so confused that I do not know how it happened. I think it
was Muller who opened the safe.
"“There is the new yellow bag,” cried Moulton, “from Schloss’ own safe."
Open it.”
"McLear had taken it. He did so. There sparkled not the real gems, but"
the replica.
"“The devil!” Moulton exclaimed, breaking from Winters and seizing the"
old bag.
He tore it open and—it was empty.
"“One moment,” interrupted Kennedy, looking up quietly from the counter."
"“Seal that safe again, McLear. In it are the Schloss jewels and the"
products of half a dozen other robberies which the dupe Muller—or
"Stein, as you please—pulled off, some as a blind to conceal the real"

Aunt Achsa had not slept through the storm. Accustomed though she was
"to the howl of the wind and the roar of the pounding surf, tonight it"
filled her heart with dread. Lavender had not come home.
Twice during the night hours she crept to the door of his small room

"""That is easily seen, and I am sure we shall be able to finish this job"
"without much trouble."""
"""Just so."""

"case.  I want to tell you this at the very beginning."""
"""I thank you most humbly,"" said the sergeant, rubbing his eyes in order"
to hide the smile in them.
"""But tell me, why did you make the acquaintance of your future"
"neighbours like this through the law courts?"""
Vaviloff shrugged his shoulders and did not answer.
"""It would have been better to come straight to us and settle the matter"
"peacefully, eh?  What do you think?"""
"""That would have been better, of course, but you see there is a"
"difficulty ...  I did not follow my own wishes, but those of others ..."
I learned afterwards that it would have been better if ... but it was
"too late."""
"""Oh!  I suppose some lawyer taught you this?"""
"""Someone of that sort."""
"""Aha!  Do you wish to settle the affair peacefully?"""
"""Were you just like what you are now when you were young?"" asked"
Kuvalda simply.  The other's nostrils twitched.  Ivan Andreyevitch
"sighed, passed his hand over his eyes and said:"
"""Oh!  When I was young I had to undergo a great many difficulties ..."
"Work!  Oh!  I did work!"""
"""And you cheated, too, I suppose?"""
"""People like you?  Nobles?  I should just think so! They used to grovel"
"at my feet!"""
"""You only went in for robbing, not murder, I suppose?"" asked the"
"Captain.  Petunikoff turned pale, and hastily changed the subject."
"""You are a bad host.  You sit while your guest stands."""
"""Let him sit, too,"" said Kuvalda."
"""But what am I to sit on?"""
"""On the earth ... it will take any rubbish ..."""
"""You are the proof of that,"" said Petunikoff quietly, while his eyes"
shot forth poisonous glances.
"And he went away, leaving Kuvalda under the pleasant impression that"
the merchant was afraid of him.  If he were not afraid of him he would
long ago have evicted him from the dosshouse.  But then he would think
"twice before turning him out, because of the five roubles a month. And"
the Captain gazed with pleasure at Petunikoff's back as he slowly
"retreated from the courtyard. Following him with his eyes, he noticed"
again.
"""I s'pose they had one o' them little lovers' quarrels an' that made 'er"
"tell you, eh?"" She laughed a forced little laugh, though her heart was"
"beating strangely as she kept on: ""He's the kind o' man who sort o'"
"polkas with every girl he meets."" And at this she began to laugh almost"
hysterically.
"Rance, who resented her apologising to anyone but himself, stood"
scowling at her.
"""What are you laughing at?"" he questioned."
"""Oh, nothin', Jack, nothin',"" half-cried, half-laughed the Girl. ""Only"
"it's kind o' funny how things come out, ain't it? Took in! Nina"
Micheltoreña! Nice company he keeps--one o' them Cachuca girls with
"eyelashes at half-mast!"""
"Once more, she broke out into a fit of laughter."
"""Well, well,"" she resumed, ""an' she sold 'im out for money! Ah, Jack"
"Rance, you're a better guesser'n I am!"" And with these words she sank"
down at the table in an apathy of misery. Horror and hatred and
hopelessness had possession of her. A fierce look was in her eyes when a
"moment later she raised her head and abruptly dismissed the boys,"
saying:
"""Well, boys, it's gittin' late--good-night!"""
Sonora was the first to make a movement towards the door.
"""Come on, boys,"" he growled in his deep bass voice; ""don't you intend to"
"""No doubt.  As soon as she returned she began to talk of him."""
And next instant I recollected the strange effect the news of his
"arrival in Paris had had upon Yolande, and the curiously tragic event"
which had subsequently occurred.  All was puzzling--all inscrutable.
A silence fell between us.  I was revolving in my mind whether I should
ask this wizen-faced old leader of Society a further question.  With
sudden resolve I turned to her again and asked:
"""O Baronne, I had quite forgotten.  Do you chance to know the Countess"
"de Foville, of Brussels?  They have a chateau down in the Ardennes, and"
"move in the best set in Belgium?"""
"""De Foville?  De Foville?"" she repeated.  ""What, do you mean the mother"
"of that little witch Yolande?"""
"""Yes.  But why do you call her a witch?""  I demanded, with feigned"
laughter.
"""Why?"" cried the old woman, the expression of her face growing dark with"
"displeasure.  ""Well, I do not know whether she is a friend of yours, but"
"all I can tell you is that should she be, the best course for you to"
"pursue is to cut her acquaintance."""
"""What do you mean?""  I gasped."
"""I mean exactly what I have said."""
"""But I don't understand,"" I cried.  ""Be more frank with me,"" I implored."
And the _Triumphants_ towed alongside.
"""Up you go,"" said Benson."
"""I won't,"" said Smith."
"""Won't you?"" asked Benson.  ""We'll see about that.  Hook on there,"
"Billings."""
And the next moment Smith was jammed in a running bowline round his
waist.
"""Sway him up,"" said Benson; and the crew of the _Harvester_ hoisted"
the notorious robber with about the only feelings of pleasure they
were likely to know till they reached New York.  And the
_Triumphants_ pushed off as they heard the mate address Mr. Smith in
language which did his reputation and the reputation of the ship most
ample justice.
"""There's talk and there's a fore-topsail-yard-ahoy voice for you,"""
"said Benson.  ""Oh, Mr. Smith will be looked after, he will.  Now,"
"chaps, pull for it, or the admiral will be waitin', and if that"
"'appens, 'twill be 'Stand from under.'"""
THE POLICY OF THE _POTLUCK_.
"Concerning the permanent and immutable characteristics of ships, the"
unhappy man who has never had his limited range of vision broadened
by a trip in a sailing ship must of necessity know little.  He
cymbal claps. Triumphantly the _maialino_ looked around. He out-smacked
all.
"The bread of the country is rather coarse and brown, with a hard, hard"
crust. A large rock of this is perched on every damp serviette. The
"_maialino_ tore his rock asunder, and grumbled at the black-cap, who had"
got a weird sort of three-cornered loaf-roll of pure white bread--starch
white. He was a swell with this white bread.
"Suddenly black-cap turned to me. Where had we come from, where were we"
"going, what for? But in laconic, sardonic tone."
"""I _like_ Sardinia,"" cried the q-b."
"""Why?"" he asked sarcastically. And she tried to find out."
"""Yes, the Sardinians please me more than the Sicilians,"" said I."
"""Why?"" he asked sarcastically."
"""They are more open--more honest."" He seemed to turn his nose down."
"""The padrone is a Sicilian,"" said the _maialino_, stuffing a huge block"
"of bread into his mouth, and rolling his insouciant eyes of a gay,"
well-fed little black pig towards the background. We weren't making much
headway.
"""You've seen Cagliari?"" the black-cap said to me, like a threat."
"""Yes! oh Cagliari pleases me--Cagliari is beautiful!"" cried the q-b,"

"The foreigners, perceiving that the Englishman was on an errand of"
"peace, gathered about the case, and soon discovered from the"
stencilled inscription that it at any rate pretended to come from
Cognac.
"""Goddam,"" said the little red-capped Frenchman who had first"
"discovered them.  ""Cognac!  I spik English--brandee, Por'smout',"
"Lon-don!"""
Jones made signs that he presented the case to them.
"""I ain't above makin' a concession or two,"" he remarked"
"confidentially to the French captain; ""but if I'd listened to my lot"
"on board, it would 'ave been blood up to the neck."""
The Frenchman shook his head.
"""You bet it would 'ave bin,"" said Jones earnestly, ""but what d'ye say"
"to 'avin' a drink?  Billy, gimme your knife."""
"And with it he started opening the case, while the Frenchmen's eyes"
gleamed in pleasing anticipation.  They had not had a drink for
weeks.  And as they carried the case down to the ship with Jones and
"their own captain in the rear, they concluded that the English were"
not such bad chaps after all.
"""But where's my man 'Art!"" asked Jones, when he came to the French"
camp.
"""'Ere I be,"" cried Hart, who was lashed hard and fast to a round"
"rock.  ""Lord, captain, but I've 'ad a time.  Can't you cut me adrift,"
her hands on his arm. The boy's form in its light underwear showed
pitifully crooked but Sidney saw him straight and she saw the gleam in
his eyes. Suddenly she remembered what Vick had said so lightly about
"the Grail. Ah, she was seeing its gleam now, transcendently beautiful,"
in Lav's eyes! She dropped her hold of his arm.
"""You see, I've _got_ to try it, Sid."" And she understood. He went on:"
"""I'll swim for the lighthouse. They can telephone from there to"
Rockman's. You girls find a light and signal with it. Don't lose your
"nerve, Sid."" He poised for an instant on the rail then plunged into the"
black water.
"""Oh, _Lav_,"" cried Sidney. She leaned far over the side of the boat."
"She could see nothing but a crest of foam. ""Mart, he's--he's--drowned!"""
Pola screamed again.
CHAPTER XX
"""THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG!"""
In the sunny embrasure of Mrs. White's morning room Trude Romley sorted
"over the mail that Pepper, the butler, had brought in. So gay and"
"colorful was the room itself with its cretonnes, its soft tinted walls,"
"its singing birds, in wicker cages, that it seemed a part of the"
fragrant garden that crowded close to the French windows. A tiny
fountain splashed azure blue water over delicately sculptured nymphs; a
flowering vine trailed around the windows.
"She was seated in a chair, motionless and statuesque, staring straight"
"before her.  The blow had utterly crushed her, for she was entirely"
devoted to her only daughter now that her husband was dead.  I well knew
"how deep was her affection for Yolande, and how tender was her maternal"
love.
"The room was in semi-darkness, for she had not risen to turn on the"
"light.  As I entered I did so with her permission, saying quietly:"
"""Madame, I come to you with a message."""
"""From whom?"" she asked in a hard mechanical voice."
"""From my friend Deane, the English doctor whom I have summoned.  Yolande"
"still lives!"""
"""She lives!"" she cried, springing to her feet in an instant.  ""You are"
"deceiving me!"""
"""I am not, madame,"" I reassured her, smiling.  ""Your daughter is still"
"breathing, and is increasing in strength perceptibly.  The doctors say"
"that she will probably recover."""
"""Thank God!"" she gasped, her thin white hands clasped before her.  ""I"
"pray that He may give her back to me.  I will go to her."""
"But I held her back, explaining that both the medical men had expressed"
a wish to remain there alone.
"""But what caused that appearance so akin to death?"" she asked quickly."
"daughter, I am pleased to tell you, will live; but she must be kept"
absolutely quiet.  I cannot allow you to approach her on any pretext
"whatsoever."""
"""She will not die, will she?"" the woman implored distractedly."
"""No,"" he replied, in a voice somewhat strained, I thought, ""she will not"
"die.  Of that you may rest assured."""
"Then turning to me, he beckoned, and I followed him out of the room."
CHAPTER EIGHT.
THE OLD LOVE.
"""I don't like that woman, old fellow,"" were the first words Dick uttered"
when we were alone in the room in which Yolande had been found.
"""Why not?""  I asked, rather surprised.  ""The Countess de Foville is"
"always charming."""
"He shrugged his shoulders, saying:"
"""One sometimes has strange and unaccountable prejudices, you know.  This"
"is one of mine."""
"""And Yolande,"" I asked, ""what of her?"""
"""She's better.  But it was fortunate I made the discovery just when I"
"did, or she would no doubt have passed away.  I never saw an appearance"
"so closely resembling death in all my experience; in fact, I'd have"
"staked my professional reputation that there was no spark of life."""
"""Would you go out in the grounds where we sat yesterday and fetch my"
"galoshes?"""
So he went out to do her this great favor. He sang a well-known popular
"song as he crossed the yard, cheerful in his own peculiar way."
She turned to me.
"""You seem silent."""
"""Do I?"""
"""Yes, you're very silent."""
"""Listen to this,"" I said, and began to read to her from the book I held in"
my hands. I read a longish bit.
"She tried to interrupt me several times, and at length said impatiently:"
"""What is this you want me to listen to?"""
"""The _Musketeers_. You must admit it's entertaining."""
"""I've read it,"" she said. And then she began to clasp her hands and drag"
them apart again.
"""Then you must hear something you haven't read before,"" I replied, and"
went across to my room to fetch a few pages I had written. They were only
"a few poems--nothing special, just a few small verses. Not that I am in"
"the habit of reading such things aloud, but I seized on this for the"
"moment because I wanted to prevent her from humbling herself, and telling"
me anything more.
"address given in the letter, he found that his brother had gone out not"
fifteen minutes before.
"“Mebbe if you step in an’ wait he’ll be back soon,” suggested the"
slatternly woman who kept the house.
"Curly was shown to a room on the second floor back, where he recognized"
a number of Bill’s belongings scattered about in the usual disorder.
Perhaps it was the sight of them which aroused in the young fellow an
"increasing doubt of his ability to do what he came for. Would this man,"
"who had never been in the habit of taking any one’s advice, listen to"
"him? He wondered, and then, unable to remain still, arose and paced the"
floor anxiously.
"Presently he dropped in a chair before a rough deal table, on top of"
which was tacked a large sheet of blotting paper. A corner of white
"""You don't happen to have lost one of your crew, tryin' to desert by"
"swimmin', sir?"""
"""Have you picked him up?  What's his name, does he say?"""
"""It's Smith, sir."""
"""That's the man,"" said Sant.  ""I want him badly."""
But Smith cried out:
"""This is kidnappin', Mr. Sant.  I refuse to go."""
"""Oh, Smith,"" said Sant, ""I'll take all the chances of it's bein'"
"anythin' you like.  Throw them a rope."""
leaned far back in his arms.
"""No,"" was the man's truthful answer."
"""Oh, how glad I am! Take me--ah, take me I don't care where as long as"
"it is with you!"" cried the Girl in an ecstasy of delight."
"""So help me, God, I'm going to . . .!"" promised Johnson, his voice"
"strained, tense. ""You're worth something better than me, Girl,"" he"
"added, a moment later, ""but they say love works miracles every hour,"
that it weakens the strong and strengthens the weak. With all my soul I
"love you, with all my soul I--"" The man let his voice die out, leaving"
"his sentence unfinished. Suddenly he called: ""Why, Min-Minnie!"""
"""I wasn't really asleep,"" spoke up the Girl, blinking sleepily. ""I'm"
"jest so happy an' let down, that's all."" The next moment, however, she"
was forced to acknowledge that she was awfully sleepy and would have to
say good-night.
"""All right,"" said Johnson, rising, and kissed her good-night."
"""That's your bed over there,"" she told him, pointing in the direction of"
the curtains.
"""But hadn't you better take the bed and let me sleep over here?"""
"""Not much!"""
"""You're sure you would be more comfortable by the fire--sure, now?"""
"""Yes, you bet!"""
want to say something in that moment. Will you be my wife? I haven’t
"had time to make love to you in the ordinary way, but I really do love"
"you. Talk quick, please—those fellows are clubbing the stuffing out of"
Union Pacific.”
"“Oh, what are you talking about?” exclaimed the young lady. She rose to"
"her feet and gazed upon him, round-eyed."
"“Don’t you understand?” said Maxwell, restively. “I want you to marry"
"me. I love you, Miss Leslie. I wanted to tell you, and I snatched a"
minute when things had slackened up a bit. They’re calling me for the
"’phone now. Tell ’em to wait a minute, Pitcher. Won’t you, Miss"
Leslie?”
The stenographer acted very queerly. At first she seemed overcome with
amazement; then tears flowed from her wondering eyes; and then she
"smiled sunnily through them, and one of her arms slid tenderly about"
the broker’s neck.
"“I know now,” she said, softly. “It’s this old business that has driven"
everything else out of your head for the time. I was frightened at
"first. Don’t you remember, Harvey? We were married last evening at 8"
o’clock in the Little Church Around the Corner.”
AFTER TWENTY YEARS
The policeman on the beat moved up the avenue impressively. The
"impressiveness was habitual and not for show, for spectators were few."
"""I'm a domestic man,"" he said suddenly.  ""A domestic man in a serious"
line of life; and I never thought to have anything like this in my
"family--never!  It's been--well, I can't tell you what it's been!"""
Gyp took up her sunshade.  She felt that she must get away; at any moment
he might say something she could not bear--and the smell of mutton rising
fast!
"""I am sorry,"" she said again; ""good-bye""; and moved past him to the door."
"She heard him breathing hard as he followed her to open it, and thought:"
'If only--oh! please let him be silent till I get outside!'  Mr. Wagge
passed her and put his hand on the latch of the front door.  His little
piggy eyes scanned her almost timidly.
"""Well,"" he said, ""I'm very glad to have the privilege of your"
"acquaintance; and, if I may say so, you 'ave--you 'ave my 'earty"
"sympathy.  Good-day."""
"The door once shut behind her, Gyp took a long breath and walked swiftly"
"away.  Her cheeks were burning; and, with a craving for protection, she"
"put up her sunshade.  But the girl's white face came up again before her,"
and the sound of her words:
"""Oh, Mrs. Fiorsen, I wish I was dead!  I DO!"""
XVI
"Gyp walked on beneath her sunshade, making unconsciously for the peace of"
"“Now, now,” said Fluffy Reubens, sprawling in two chairs. “Chuck it,"
Blotte--you make me feel as cold as a dead undertaker.... Lor!” he
"yawned, “this is precious slow.” He yawned again: “Paul Pangbutt’s a"
"confounded long time, ain’t he? Scenting his beard, I suspect!”"
"Andrew Blotte roused from his mood, and he began to pace up and down"
the room as before: “No more Italian waiters for me--with cursèd oily
"locks,” he cried--“no more grease-spots on dingy grey tablecloths that"
hide their offences under smiling napkins!... To-night I shall be
waited upon by the gods.... Never again the boiled potato; never again
"the homely bun, damn them!... This is the night of life--a night for"
"music and gaiety and minstrelsy.... Hunger shall cease, and pain----”"
"Rippley went up to him and took him by the shoulder, kindly:"
"“Stop it, Blotte. Aren’t you well, old man?”"
Blotte laughed:
“Well?... Psha! I am like a boy. The new genius arrives to-night. And I
go off--to sup with the gods.... The world has forgotten Andrew Blotte.”
"Rippley turned, a twinkle in his eye, to the others:"
"“I say, boys,” said he--“as it’s to be a unique night, and Blotte"
"about to be translated, and may be in the papers in the morning----”"
"Blotte laughed grimly, where he paced:"
"“Oh, yes,” he growled--“I shall be in the papers to-morrow. Have no"
fear of it.”
"“I wanted to tell you about it, that 's all,” said Risca. “I made up my"
mind this afternoon. The only thing is what the deuce am I to do with a
child of fifteen in Fenton Square?”
“Is she pretty?”
"“Lord, no. Coarse, undersized little cockney, ugly as sin.”"
"“Anyhow,” said Herold, extinguishing his cigarette in the ash-tray,"
"“it's out of the question.” He rose from his chair. “Look here,” he"
"cried with an air of inspiration, “why not send her down to The Channel"
House?”
“I'm not going to shift responsibilities on to other people's
"shoulders,” John growled in his obstinate way. “This child 's my"
"responsibility. I 'm going to see her through somehow. As to Southcliff,"
"you must be crazy to suggest it. What's to prevent her, one fine"
"day, from getting into Stella's room and talking? My God! it would be"
appalling!”
Herold agreed. He had spoken thoughtlessly.
"“I should just think so,” said Risca. “The idea of such a tale of horror"
being told in that room--”
"The dresser entered. “Miss Mercier has just gone on, sir.”"
"“Well, just think out something else till I come back,” said Herold. “At"
"any rate, Fenton Square won't do.”"
He left John to smoke and meditate among the clothes hanging up on pegs
"formidable in small operations. He kept his cab at the door, rang, and"
"asked for Gyp, with a kind of pleasure in his ruse."
"""She's not in yet, sir.  Mr. Fiorsen's in."""
"""Ah!  And baby?"""
"""Yes, sir."""
"""I'll come in and see her.  In the garden?"""
"""Yes, sir."""
"""Dogs there, too?"""
"""Yes, sir.  And will you have tea, please, sir?"""
"""No, thanks.""  How to effect this withdrawal without causing gossip, and"
"yet avoid suspicion of collusion with Gyp?  And he added: ""Unless Mrs."
"Fiorsen comes in."""
"Passing out into the garden, he became aware that Fiorsen was at the"
"dining-room window watching him, and decided to make no sign that he knew"
"this.  The baby was under the trees at the far end, and the dogs came"
rushing thence with a fury which lasted till they came within scent of
"him.  Winton went leisurely up to the perambulator, and, saluting Betty,"
"looked down at his grandchild. She lay under an awning of muslin, for"
"fear of flies, and was awake.  Her solemn, large brown eyes, already like"
"Gyp's, regarded him with gravity.  Clucking to her once or twice, as is"
"the custom, he moved so as to face the house.  In this position, he had"
Betty with her back to it.  And he said quietly:
"know--"""
"""Daphne Wing?"""
"""Yes.  A child is coming.  They have made her tell.  It means the"
"cancelling of her engagements, of course--and other things."""
Gyp uttered a little laugh; then she said slowly:
"""Can you tell me, please, what this Mr.--Wagge can do?"""
Again Rosek shrugged his shoulders.
"""He is rabid--a rabid man of his class is dangerous.  A lot of money will"
"be wanted, I should think--some blood, perhaps."""
"He moved swiftly to her, and said very low:"
"""Gyp, it is a year since I told you of this.  You did not believe me"
"then.  I told you, too, that I loved you.  I love you more, now, a"
"hundred times!  Don't move!  I am going up to Gustav."""
"He turned, and Gyp thought he was really going; but he stopped and came"
back past the line of the window.  The expression of his face was quite
"changed, so hungry that, for a moment, she felt sorry for him.  And that"
"must have shown in her face, for he suddenly caught at her, and tried to"
"kiss her lips; she wrenched back, and he could only reach her throat, but"
"that he kissed furiously.  Letting her go as suddenly, he bent his head"
and went out without a look.
"Gyp stood wiping his kisses off her throat with the back of her hand,"
"dumbly, mechanically thinking: ""What have I done to be treated like this?"
"""Solem has gone now,"" Josephine replied."
"""Lucky for him!"""
"""Why?"" asked Josephine."
"""Oh, he's a dreadful creature!"""
How agitated she was! But in the course of the day she calmed down. Her
"anger dissolved, and there was neither weeping nor a scene; only she did"
"not walk proudly, as was her habit, but preferred to sit in silence."
"That passed too; she roused herself briskly soon after Solem's departure,"
"and in a few days she was the same as ever. She took walks, she talked and"
"laughed with us, she made the actor swing her in the children's swing, as"
in the lawyer's day....
"I went out one evening, for there was good weather and darkness for"
walking; there was neither a moon nor stars. The gentle ripple of the
little Reisa river was all the sound I heard; there were God and Goethe
"and _über allen Gipfeln ist Ruh'_ that night. On my return, I was in"
"the mood to walk softly and on tiptoe, so I undressed and went to bed in"
the dark.
"Then they came again to my window, those two lunatics, the lady and the"
actor. What next? But it was not he that chose this spot; of that I was
sure. She chose it because she was convinced I had returned. There was
something she _wanted_ me to hear.
Why should I listen to him still pleading with her?
"""I've had enough of this,"" he said. ""I'm leaving tomorrow."""
"his coat. He stopped laughing then, by calculated degrees."
"""Sit down--sit down!"" said he wheezily. ""What's your hurry? You haven't"
told me yet what those few 'trifling formalities' are. And how am I to
"know whether--"""
"But Slyne was already beyond the doorway, fumbling with a last button."
"""If you believe I've come here to talk simply for the sake of talking,"""
"said he with sombre magnificence, ""I needn't waste any more breath on"
"you. Good-bye."""
"Captain Dove jumped out of his bunk. He was clearly impressed, in spite"
"of himself, by the other's indomitable assurance."
"""Come back, you fool!"" he called angrily. ""Come back. I want to know--"
"""I'll go ashore with you,"" he shouted, raising his voice, since Slyne"
was already on his way to the gangway. But Slyne did not seem to hear.
"""I'll take your offer--for Sallie,"" cried Captain Dove, in a slightly"
lower tone.
"Slyne hesitated in his stride, stopped, and turned back into the"
alleyway which led to the saloon.
"""What was that you said?"" he demanded of Captain Dove."
"""Come on inside,"" requested Captain Dove, more curtly."
"""I don't believe I will,"" Slyne declared, inwardly elated over the"
"winning of that somewhat risky move. ""You don't deserve another chance."

"""And Lavender is best of all--"""
Now quick tears shone like stars in Trude Romley's eyes. She reached
out her hands and caught Sidney's.
"""Oh, Lavender--when I think what _he_ did I--I--"" She could not finish,"
but Sidney understood the gratitude that was in her heart. She leaned
her face against Trude's shoulder with a long sigh.
"""I'm cured of lots of things, Trude. I wanted something different but I"
didn't want all _this_ to happen! You see I _made_ Lavender and Mart
believe it was diamonds Jed Starrow was hiding when it was probably
"only a case of rum--"""
"Suddenly Trude straightened. ""I almost forgot. A boy came here and said"
a Captain Davies wanted you to come down to Rockman's wharf as soon as
you could. That was two hours ago. You see it is nearly noon now. You'd
"better dress quickly and I'll go out and fix you some breakfast."""
Sidney obeyed reluctantly. In her mingled remorse and humiliation she
shrank from facing the world. She was not even curious as to why Cap'n
Phin wanted to see her.
By the time she had dressed Trude had a poached egg and a glass of milk
ready for her. Miss Letty was with Lavender and Aunt Achsa had gone to
bed.
Sidney begged so hard that Trude accompany her to Rockman's that Trude
put on her hat and went with her. And poor Sidney needed Trude's
support for Sunset Lane was thronged with curious men and women; as
to his shoulders.
I hadn't seen hair like that on a man except maybe in history books;
every man I'd ever known had his hair cropped in the fashionable
"soup-bowl style. I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting about the"
"blaster which I knew it was against the law for him to have at all,"
when I suddenly got scared right through.
His eyes.
They didn't blink and there seemed to be no expression around them.
Just coldness. Maybe it was the kind of clothes he was wearing that did
"it, but all of a sudden I was reminded of a crocodile I'd seen in a"
surface zoo that had stared quietly at me for twenty minutes until it
opened two long tooth-studded jaws.
"""Green shatas!"" he said suddenly. ""Only a tadpole. I must be getting"
"jumpy enough to splash."""
Then he shoved the blaster away in a holster made of the same scaly
"leather, crossed his arms on his chest and began to study me. I grunted"
"to my feet, feeling a lot better. The coldness had gone out of his eyes."
"I held out my hand the way Sis had taught me. ""My name is Ferdinand"
"Sparling. I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr.--Mr.--"""
"""Hope for your sake,"" he said to me, ""that you aren't what you"
"seem--tadpole brother to one of them husbandless anura."""
"""_What?_"""
"""A 'nuran is a female looking to nest. Anura is a herd of same. Come"
"“Gracious, father! What a fright you gave me! Have you just come home?"
Why isn’t Charles here to help you off with your coat?”
"Her cheeks were crimson from playing, her eyes glittered, the hair fell"
over her forehead. And she breathed as though she had come running
through the dark and was frightened. Old Mr. Neave stared at his
youngest daughter; he felt he had never seen her before. So that was
"Lola, was it? But she seemed to have forgotten her father; it was not"
for him that she was waiting there. Now she put the tip of her crumpled
handkerchief between her teeth and tugged at it angrily. The telephone
rang. A-ah! Lola gave a cry like a sob and dashed past him. The door of
"the telephone-room slammed, and at the same moment Charlotte called,"
"“Is that you, father?”"
"“You’re tired again,” said Charlotte reproachfully, and she stopped the"
rocker and offered her warm plum-like cheek. Bright-haired Ethel pecked
"his beard, Marion’s lips brushed his ear."
"“Did you walk back, father?” asked Charlotte."
"“Yes, I walked home,” said old Mr. Neave, and he sank into one of the"
immense drawing-room chairs.
“But why didn’t you take a cab?” said Ethel. “There are hundreds of
cabs about at that time.”
"“My dear Ethel,” cried Marion, “if father prefers to tire himself out,"
I really don’t see what business of ours it is to interfere.”
"“Children, children?” coaxed Charlotte."
"""You've been very good to me--yes, very good."""
He turned to her with a gesture of disclaimer. She thought he was going
"to speak, but he did not."
"""Whatever happens, I shall always remember that with--with deep"
"gratitude."""
"""What is going to happen?"" he asked, with an uneasy smile."
"""Oh, how can I?"" she burst out. ""How can I say it? How can I ask you?"""
"As she spoke she stopped, and he followed her example. They stood facing"
"one another now, as he replied gravely,"
"""Whatever you ask--let it be what it will--I will answer, truthfully."" A"
pause before the last word perhaps betrayed a momentary struggle.
"""What right have I? Why should you?"""
"""The right my--my desire to have your regard gives you. How can I ask"
"for that, unless I am ready to tell you all you can wish to know?"""
"""I have heard,"" she began falteringly, ""I have been told by--by people"
"who, I suppose, were right to tell me----"""
In a moment he understood her. A slight twitch of his mouth betrayed his
"trouble, but he came to her rescue."
"""I don't know how it reached you,"" he said. ""Perhaps I think you might"
have been--you need not have known it. But there is only one thing you
"“Oh, dear! I wish they would not fight at your school, Tom. Didn't it"
hurt you?”
"“Hurt me? No,” said Tom, putting up the hooks again, taking out a large"
"pocket-knife, and slowly opening the largest blade, which he looked at"
meditatively as he rubbed his finger along it. Then he added:
“I gave Spooner a black eye--that's what he got for wanting to leather
me. I wasn't going to go halves because anybody leathered me.”
"“Oh! how brave you are, Tom. I think you are like Samson. If there came"
"a lion roaring at me, I think you'd fight him, wouldn't you, Tom?”"
"“How can a lion come roaring at you, you silly thing? There's no lions"
only in the shows.”
"“No, but if we were in the lion countries--I mean in Africa where it's"
"very hot, the lions eat people there. I can show it you in the book"
where I read it.”
"“Well, I should get a gun and shoot him.”"
"“But if you hadn't got a gun?--we might have gone out, you know, not"
"thinking, just as we go out fishing, and then a great lion might come"
"towards us roaring, and we could not get away from him. What should you"
"do, Tom?”"
"Tom paused, and at last turned away contemptuously, saying: “But the"
lion _isn't_ coming. What's the use of talking?”
This passage illustrates also the difference between the
sharpest wits going to get my pile. A man gets in a groove in New York.
It takes the West to put a razor-edge on him.”
The policeman twirled his club and took a step or two.
“I’ll be on my way. Hope your friend comes around all right. Going to
call time on him sharp?”
“I should say not!” said the other. “I’ll give him half an hour at
"least. If Jimmy is alive on earth he’ll be here by that time. So long,"
officer.”
"“Good-night, sir,” said the policeman, passing on along his beat,"
trying doors as he went.
"There was now a fine, cold drizzle falling, and the wind had risen from"
its uncertain puffs into a steady blow. The few foot passengers astir
in that quarter hurried dismally and silently along with coat collars
turned high and pocketed hands. And in the door of the hardware store
"the man who had come a thousand miles to fill an appointment, uncertain"
"almost to absurdity, with the friend of his youth, smoked his cigar and"
waited.
"About twenty minutes he waited, and then a tall man in a long overcoat,"
"with collar turned up to his ears, hurried across from the opposite"
side of the street. He went directly to the waiting man.
"“Is that you, Bob?” he asked, doubtfully."
"“Is that you, Jimmy Wells?” cried the man in the door."
"“Bless my heart!” exclaimed the new arrival, grasping both the other’s"
Then Dugald Allan spied Pola shivering forlornly behind Mart and
"Sidney. ""_You_--"" he cried, pushing Sidney aside. ""I thought you were"
"at Chatham!"" His mouth tightened in a straight, stern line. ""What is"
"all this? But wait, I must get Sidney back to Aunt Achsa. You shall"
"explain things as we go along."""
"He hurried the girls through the crowd which parted, smilingly, to let"
"them pass. On Commercial Street he hailed old Hiram Moss, who with an"
"eye to business in the midst of tragedy, had harnessed his horses to"
his ancient cab and had them ready for an emergency.
After he had bundled his charges in Dugald Allan turned to Sidney.
"""Now give me some inkling of what started this crazy adventure. Thank"
God it has not ended as it might have ended though Lavender is still
"fighting for his life! Answer me, Sidney."""
But before Sidney could begin her tale she had to know what had
happened to Lavender.
"""Fighting for his life? But--he _got here_, didn't he?"""
"""Yes--he reached shore, by an effort so great as to completely"
"prostrate him. They took him home. I left Doctor Blackwell with him."""
Dugald Allan spoke shortly and his crisp sentences had the effect of
"stunning poor Sidney. She shivered and leaned close to him. Her voice,"
"when she spoke, came with a childish tremor."
"""Oh, Lavender _can't_ die. If he does--it will be all my fault! I"
"started everything. I--I told him about the diamonds--"""
"""_Diamonds_--"""
of the Rogans caught her by the wrists and dragged her forward.
"""They have come to question you,"" Greca lamented to Brand. ""And they"
"want to do it through me. But I will not! I will not!"""
Brand smiled at her though his lips were pale.
"""You are powerless to struggle,"" he said. ""Do as they ask. You cannot"
"help us by refusing, and, in any case, I can promise that they won't"
"learn anything from us."""
"The tall Rogan teetered up to the prisoners on his gangling legs, and"
"stared icily at them. Crouched beside him, her lovely body all one"
mute appeal to the Earthmen to forgive her for the part she was forced
"to play, was Greca."
At length the Rogan leader spoke. He addressed his sibilant words to
"Greca, though his stony eyes were kept intently on the Earthmen."
"""He says,"" exclaimed Greca telepathically, ""to inform you first that"
"he is head of all the Rogan race on this globe, and that all on this"
"globe must do as he commands."""
Brand nodded to show he understood the message.
"""He says he is going to ask you a few questions, and that you are to"
"answer truthfully if you value your lives:"""
"""First, he wants to know what the people of your world are like. Are"
"they all the same as you?"""

clever enough? Then the situation stimulated her. She held out her hand
to Boswell.
“You have come to see me?” she cried delightedly. “Mr. Trent has just
"been telling us that you came down with him, and I hoped you would call"
soon.”
"“Yes, to be sure—to be sure. You might have known I would call soon.”"
"He bowed stiffly to Trent, and, seating himself close beside Jessica,"
murmured in her ear: “Cannot you get rid of that fellow? How did he find
you out so soon?”
"“Why, he came to see Edith, of course. Do you not remember how devoted"
he always was to her?”
“I do not—”
"“May I ask what you are whispering about, Mr. Boswell?” demanded Trent,"
breaking from Miss Decker. “Is he confiding to you the astounding
"success of his last novel, Mrs. Pendleton? Or was it a history of the"
United States? I really forget.”
"“Not the last, certainly. I leave it to you to make history—an abridged"
edition. My ambition is a more humble one.”
"“Oh, you will both need biographers,” said Mrs. Pendleton, who was"
beginning to enjoy herself. “I will give you an idea. Join the
Theosophists. Arrange for reincarnation. Come back in the next
generation and write your own biographies. Then your friends and
families cannot complain you have not had justice done you.”
“Ha! ha!” said Trent.
"“Well, crowd along!” advised Ned."
“Crowd along?” repeated Jimmie. “What for?”
"“Use your nose,” advised Ned."
Jimmie sniffed elaborately and hit Ned a resounding whack on the back.
Then he sat down on the bottom of the passage.
"“Say, Ned, look here!” he said. “When we got into this scrape, we didn’t"
"look for any old Franciscan monks to help us out, did we? Two or three"
"hundred years ago, when they dug this passage through the rock, they"
"hadn’t any idea they were digging it for us, had they?”"
"“This is a mysterious world,” Ned answered. “It seems to be unnecessary"
for us to plan any mode of escape. The wise old chap who formed the
"Franciscan order in Europe, hundreds of years ago, prepared the way of"
escape for us!”
“That’s what he did!” answered Jimmie. “And I wish he had gone a little
farther and prepared a good fat meat pie for us.”
"“Jimmie,” Ned chuckled, “some day you’ll get into a corner where you"
won’t get anything to eat for a week. I never knew a boy who thought so
much of his stomach as you do!”
“May the day be long delayed!” laughed Jimmie.
"“Well, crawl along!” Ned advised, “and I’ll see if I can get this slab"
of stone you pushed out back in its place.”
"""But how'll we get ashore?"""
"""The tide'll be out towards morning."""
"""You mean _swim_?"" cried Pola. ""But I _can't_ swim! I--I--"""
"True, Pola's complex! Sidney hastened to reassure her."
"""When the tide's out it won't be over your head. And I'll help you."""
Lavender had already let the line of the dory slip out of his hand.
They saw the old boat become a shadowy outline as the tide carried it
"slowly away, then--nothing. Pola caught Sidney's hand and held it."
"""I'm not frightened--but it's so--_spooky_!"""
It had been decided that they should conceal themselves in the
"fo'castle cabin. They groped their way forward, Sidney guiding Pola in"
"the dark, for Lavender dared not light any of his matches. Stumbling,"
"scarcely breathing, they slipped down the companion ladder and crawled"
"into the small, ill-ventilated cabin. Sidney sat down upon some"
tarpaulins. Pola crouched close to Sidney's side. Lav and Mart stowed
themselves upon one of the bunks.
"""There--now we'll wait!"""
"""I--I wish I knew what _for_!"" whispered Pola. The smell of rank bilge"
"water, the lift and drop of the boat sickened her. The wind was whining"
and that and the swish of the water against the sides of the boat
terrified the girl.
In a few short words Lav vouchsafed Pola a little information. Like
"and peered in, shielding her candle with a trembling hand. For a long"
while she sat in the window straining her eyes into the darkness. The
cats came and rubbed her bare ankles and Nip meowed plaintively. She
picked him up and cuddled him to her.
Suddenly a moving object in the lane caught her attention. It separated
"itself into the forms of men, men moving slowly as though they bore a"
burden. They turned into the garden patch.
"""Lavender!"" Aunt Achsa cried, jumping up quickly, shaking. ""Oh--my boy!"""
But that was the only sound she made. She opened the door as though she
had been waiting for these men with their limp burden. She directed
them to carry the boy to his own room. She moved aside for Doctor
"Blackwell who had come with the others, an old pair of flannel trousers"
drawn over his night shirt. She felt Mr. Dugald put a restraining arm
"over her shoulders and nodded as though to say: ""I'm all right--just"
"look out for Lavender."""
One of the men coming back from Lavender's room offered an explanation.
"""Those young 'uns were on the _Arabella_ and it broke from its"
"moorin's. The boy swum ashore to give an alarm. Plucky, I say--don't"
"know how he did it."""
"""Those young ones--_who_?"" cried Dugald Allan."
"""Why, I cal'late that gal Sidney and I don't know who else--"""
"""Sidney went with Miss Vine!"" protested Achsa."
"But at that moment Miss Letty appeared in the door, as scantily clad as"
the doctor had been. From her window which faced Doctor Blackwell's
"hands with his own. “It’s Bob, sure as fate. I was certain I’d find you"
"here if you were still in existence. Well, well, well!—twenty years is"
"a long time. The old restaurant’s gone, Bob; I wish it had lasted, so"
"we could have had another dinner there. How has the West treated you,"
old man?”
"“Bully; it has given me everything I asked it for. You’ve changed lots,"
Jimmy. I never thought you were so tall by two or three inches.”
"“Oh, I grew a bit after I was twenty.”"
"“Doing well in New York, Jimmy?”"
"“Moderately. I have a position in one of the city departments. Come on,"
"Bob; we’ll go around to a place I know of, and have a good long talk"
about old times.”
"The two men started up the street, arm in arm. The man from the West,"
"his egotism enlarged by success, was beginning to outline the history"
"of his career. The other, submerged in his overcoat, listened with"
interest.
"At the corner stood a drug store, brilliant with electric lights. When"
they came into this glare each of them turned simultaneously to gaze
upon the other’s face.
The man from the West stopped suddenly and released his arm.
"“You’re not Jimmy Wells,” he snapped. “Twenty years is a long time, but"
not long enough to change a man’s nose from a Roman to a pug.”
"“It sometimes changes a good man into a bad one,” said the tall man."
Then he gave a great cry.
"""Ever, ever night!"" he said, stretching out his hands despairingly as"
to an eternal void.
The duke's eyes seemed to look leagues away over moor and valley and
"hill, where the blackened ruins of Astura rose beneath a dun smoke"
against the calm of the morning sky.
"A strange tenderness played upon his lips, as if with the extinction"
of the Frangipani brood peace had entered his soul.
"""A man is a mystery to himself,"" he said."
"""But to God?"""
"""I know no God, save the God, my own soul! Let me live and"
"die,--nothing more! Why curse one's life with a 'to be?'"""
Francesco sighed heavily.
"""It is a kind of Fate to me!"" he said, ""inevitable as the setting of"
"the sun, natural as sleep. Not for myself do I fear it alone,--but I"
"should not like to think that I should never see her again."""
"The duke's eyes had caught life on the distant hillside, life surging"
"from the valleys, life and the glory of it. Harness, helm and shield"
"shone in the sun. Gold, azure, silver, scarlet were creeping from the"
bronzed green of the wilds. Silent and solemn the host rolled slowly
into the full splendor of the day.
The duke's face had kindled.
“He’s after us now all right!” whispered Jimmie.
"“Keep still, you little dunce!” Ned said."
"“If he sticks his head up here, soak him!” advised Jimmie."
"“Don’t you think I won’t,” Ned returned."
But Huga did not enter the huge old fireplace at all. When he flashed
"his light into the chimney he saw only straight up, and the vertical"
passage from the fire-flue was too small for even a small cat to
negotiate.
The chamber into which the boys had found their way was directly at the
"back of the flue, and might have been seen by a more careful man. The"
boys chuckled as the half-breed turned away.
In a few minutes the sounds of pursuit ceased entirely. Lights no longer
"flashed about the room, creating a faint mist in the fireplace below."
Still the boys were not certain that the outlaws had abandoned the hunt.
"“Say, Ned,” Jimmie whispered, directly, poking Ned in the ribs, “you"
"didn’t bring one of those bear steaks with you, did you?”"
"“Why, Jimmie,” Ned said in pretended amazement, “you’re not getting"
"hungry, are you? I’m astonished at that!”"
“Hungry!” repeated the boy. “I feel as if I could eat my way through
this rock like a mouse eats through cheese! And I could drink a barrel
of water. There never was such a thirst.”
"what's the use of jaw?  I say get up stores, eh, Mackenzie?"""
"""Don't ask me,"" said old Mac.  ""I was thinkin' that mighty soon we'd"
"be able to settle that question about the buildin' of the _Potluck_."""
And as by this time Jones was calming down and was rather inclined to
"cry, Lampert came up to the restive crowd."
"""You dry up, Hart,"" he said roughly.  ""Until the ship's broken up,"
"you're on the articles.  Say another word and I'll break your jaw."""
"""Yes, sir,"" said Hart respectfully."
"Until dawn they loafed about the deck and in the cabin and foc'sle,"
"discussing whether they were on one of the Crozets or what, and"
"whether they would stay long there, and if so what, and so on."
And just as the dawn broke over the island they got an awful
surprise.  They saw a man standing on the low cliff on about a level
with the jagged splinters of the fore-topmast where it had gone short
in the cap.
"""The bloomin' hisland's in'abited,"" cried a foremast hand, and every"
one rushed forward to interview the gesticulating stranger.
"""Wod's the bloke say?"" asked the crowd.  ""Oh, say it again!""  And the"
stranger said it again.
But the crowd shook a unanimous head.
"""I believe the silly galoot don't talk English,"" cried Hart; ""'ere,"
"where's Dutchy?"""
for himself.
"""Congratulations."""
"""Thank you."""
"""That ought to grease the way in the Diet for your deal. And the"
protocol's financial grab ought to sail through the Supreme Soviet. You
prove this marvel can work and the rest is merely laundering your
"profits."""
"""So I would like to think,"" he nodded. ""Of course, one never knows how"
"these things will eventually turn out."""
"""So when do I get a look at it?"""
"""Why, that all depends on certain agreements we need to make."""
"""Then I guess it's time I heard the bottom line."""
"""Most assuredly."" He leaned back. ""Dr. Vance, you have just caused me"
considerable hardship. Nor is this the first occasion you have done so.
"Yet, I have not achieved what I have to date without becoming something"
of a judge of men. The financial arrangements you put together in
"London demonstrated, I thought, remarkable ingenuity. There could be a"
"place for you in my organization, despite all that has happened between"
"us."""
"""I don't work for the mob, if that's what you're hoping."""
"""Don't be foolhardy. Those days are well behind me,"" he went on calmly,"
"despite the flicker of anger in his eyes. ""The completion of this"
"“Father never talks his business over with any one,” Jack broke in."
"“If we had only known about the outlaws being here in the hills,” Harry"
"suggested, “we might have kept out of sight of them for a long time."
"But, you see, they found us first.”"
"“And they used a nice, crooked little spy to do it with!” Frank"
exclaimed. “This little alleged Boy Scout who stole our provisions last
"night, and crept into the woods to tell Jimmie and I to beat it, and"
"then brought a note to Ned to get him away from the camp, must be"
playing a leading part for the sneaks.”
“He’s doing all of that!” Jack agreed. “I don’t believe he’s a Boy Scout
at all. He’s just picked up a word or two and a sign.”
"“Perhaps we’ll run across him again,” Frank said. “If we do, I’ll find"
out whether he’s a Boy Scout or not!”
"“Well,” Jack exclaimed, springing to his feet, “are we going to sit here"
all day and let Jimmie do all the hunting? We ought to get out in the
mountains and help find Ned.”
"“Look here, boys!” Harry cried, “do you see anything to the east there"
that looks at all familiar?”
“Do you mean the smoke coming up over the tops of the trees?” asked
Frank. “I noticed that several minutes ago.”
"“Well, just keep your eye on it,” Harry advised, “and see if it brings"
anything to your mind.”
"“Sure it does!” shouted Frank, all excitement now. “There are two"
"""They're hostile, whatever they are,"" said Dex. ""Look out: that one's"
"pointing something at you!"""
"One of the slender, tottering creatures had raised an arm and leveled"
"at Brand something that looked rather like an elongated, old-fashioned"
flashlight. Brand involuntarily ducked. The clear glass panel between
them and the mob outside gave him a queasy feeling of being exposed to
whatever missile might lurk in the thing's tube.
"""What do we do now?"" demanded Dex with a shaky laugh. ""You're chief of"
"this expedition. I'm waiting for orders."""
"""We wait right here,"" replied Brand. ""We're safe in the shell till"
"we're starved out. At least they can't get in to attack us."""
"But it developed that, while the slimy looking things might not be"
"able to get in, they had ways of reaching the Earthmen just the same!"
*       *       *       *       *
The creature with the gun-like tube extended it somewhat further
toward Brand.
"Brand felt a sharp, unpleasant tingle shoot through his body, as"
"though he had received an electric shock. He winced, and cried out at"
the sudden pain of it.
"""What's the matter--"" Dex began. But hardly had the words left his"
"mouth when he, too, felt the shock. A couple of good, hearty Earth"
oaths exploded from his lips.
The character of his relations towards them was confirmed by the
"appearance of his clothes, which, as a rule, were tidy, and cleaner"
"than those of his companions.  And now, sitting at the door of the"
"dosshouse, he boastingly related that for a long time past Redka had"
"been asking him to go and live with her, but he had not gone because he"
did not want to part with the company.  They heard this with jealous
"interest.  They all knew Redka.  She lived very near the town, almost"
"below the mountain.  Not long ago, she had been in prison for theft."
"She was a retired nurse; a tall, stout peasant woman, with a face"
"marked by smallpox, but with very pretty, though always drunken, eyes."
"""Just look at the old devil!"" swore Abyedok, looking at Simtsoff, who"
was smiling in a self-satisfied way.
"""And do you know why they love me?  Because I know how to cheer up"
"their souls."""
"""Do you?"" inquired Kuvalda."
"""And I can make them pity me....  And a woman, when she pities!  Go and"
"weep to her, and ask her to kill you ... she will pity you--and she"
"will kill you."""
"""I feel inclined to commit a murder,"" declared Martyanoff, laughing his"
dull laugh.
"""Upon whom?"" asked Abyedok, edging away from him."
"""It's all the same to me ... Petunikoff ... Egorka ... or even you!"""
"""And why?"" inquired Kuvalda."
"""But there's jest one thing you've overlooked explainin', Mr. Johnson."
It shows exactly what you are. It wasn't so much your bein' a road agent
"I got against you. It's this:"" And here she stamped her foot excitedly."
"""You kissed me--you got my first kiss."""
Johnson hung his head.
"""You said,"" kept on the Girl, hotly, ""you'd ben thinkin' o' me ever"
"since you saw me at Monterey, an' all the time you walked straight off"
"an' ben kissin' that other woman."" She shrugged her shoulder and laughed"
"grimly. ""You've got a girl,"" she continued, growing more and more"
"indignant. ""It's that I've got against you. It's my first kiss I've got"
against you. It's that Nina Micheltoreña that I can't forgive. So now
"you can git--git!"" And with these words she unbolted the door and"
concluded tensely:
"""If they kill you I don't care. Do you hear, I don't care . . ."""
At those bitter words spoken by lips which failed so utterly to hide
"their misery, the Girl's face became colourless."
"With the instinct of a brave man to sell his life as dearly as possible,"
"Johnson took a couple of guns from his pocket; but the next moment, as"
if coming to the conclusion that death without the Girl would be
"preferable, he put them back, saying:"
"""You're right, Girl."""
The next instant he had passed out of the door which she held wide open
for him.
"she asked in a low, intense voice.  ""You have forgotten me for three"
"whole years until now."""
"""I know--I know!""  I cried.  ""Forgive me."""
"""I have already forgiven,"" she said, allowing her hand still to remain"
"in mine.  ""But I have been thinking to-day--thinking ever so much."""
"Her voice was weak and faltering, and I saw that she was not herself."
"""Thinking of what?"""
"""Of you.  I have been wondering whether, if I had died, you would have"
"sometimes remembered me?"""
"""Remembered you?""  I said earnestly.  ""Why, of course, dearest.  Why do"
"you speak in such a melancholy tone?"""
"""Because--well, because I am unhappy, Gerald!"" she cried, bursting into"
"sudden tears.  ""Ah! you do not know how I suffer--you can never know!"""
"I bent and stroked her hair, that beautiful red-gold hair that I had so"
often heard admired in the great salons in Brussels.  It had been bound
"but lightly by her maid, and was secured by a blue ribbon.  She had"
"apologised for receiving me thus, but declared that her head ached, and"
"it was easier so.  Doctor Deane had called twice that morning, and had"
pronounced her entirely out of danger.
"""But why are you suffering?""  I asked, caressing her and striving to"
"charm away her tears.  ""Cannot you confide in me?"""
"She shook her head in despair, and her body was shaken by a convulsive"
"""Yolande--Yolande!""  I called, touching her cheek in an effort to awaken"
"her, for I could not believe that she was actually dead."
But there was no response.  Those blanched lips and the coldness of
those cheeks told their own tale.  She had passed to that land which
lies beyond the range of human vision.
How long I stood there I cannot tell.  My thoughts were inexpressibly
"sad ones, and the discovery had utterly upset me, so that I scarcely"
knew what I said or did.  The blow of thus finding her lifeless crushed
"me.  The affair was mysterious, to say the least of it.  Of a sudden,"
"however, the sobs of the grief-stricken Countess aroused me to a sense"
"of my responsibility, and taking her hand I led her from the bedside"
into an adjoining room.
"""How has this terrible catastrophe occurred?""  I demanded of her"
"breathlessly.  ""Only two hours ago she was well and happy."""
"""You mean when you saw her?"" she said.  ""What was the object of your"
"call?"""
"""To see her,"" I responded."
"""And yet you parted ill friends in Brussels?"" she observed in a tone of"
"distinct suspicion.  ""You had some motive in calling.  What was it?"""
I hesitated.  I could not tell her that I suspected her daughter to be a
spy.

"stops suddenly and stares, takes a few steps toward him, and bends"
forward searchingly.
"""Isn't it--? Oh, no, excuse me, I thought--"""
"""Yes, it is. Good evening, Miss Torsen."""
"""Why, good evening. I thought it looked like you. Good evening. Yes, thank"
"you, very well. And thanks for the knapsack; I understood all at once--I"
"quite understand--"""
"""Do you live here? What a strange coincidence!"""
"""Yes, I live here; those are my windows. You wouldn't like to come up,"
"would you? No, perhaps you wouldn't."""
"""But I know where there are some benches down by the shore. Unless you're"
"cold?"" I suggested."
"""No, I'm not cold. Yes, thank you, I'd like to."""
"We went down to a bench, looking like a father and daughter out walking."
"There was nothing striking about us, and we sat the whole evening"
undisturbed. Later we sat undisturbed on other evenings all through a cold
autumn month.
"Then she told me first the short chapter of her journey home, some of it"
"only hinted, suggested, and some of it in full; sometimes with her head"
"deeply bowed, sometimes, when I asked a question, replying by a brief word"
or a shake of the head. I write it down from memory; it was important to
"her, and it became important for others as well."
He opened a drawer of his desk and reached for the Scotch bottle.

At the Newark Airport he would not trust his suitcase to a porter
because the leather loop holding one side of the handle was very thin
and he was afraid it would break.
Once he had been ashamed of the shabbiness of the bag and had planned to
"buy a new one, but now there was an affinity between them, a kind of"
warmth.
Were they companions in misery?
He asked the question with a quick smile and then realized he was not
"miserable. A little bleak of mind, perhaps, with Minnesota and what lay"
ahead affording no glow of anticipation in his mind. But that would
"pass. No, he had relegated the hurt to a mental pigeonhole; maybe he"
"would bring it out and look at it once in a while, after enough time had"
passed.
But he was not miserable.
"He went to the counter, checked in, and they told him his plane would"
take off on time. He glanced at his watch. Thirty-two minutes.
He went back to the bench and found Rhoda Kane sitting beside his
suitcase.
"She wore a plain, black suit with a ridiculous little black hat and she"
was so beautiful he was angry with her. He hated her. This good-bye
wasn't necessary. Why had she come?
"in it, to check up on the disappearance of the first. That ship, too,"
never came back. Almost with the second of its arrival at the edge of
the red area all radio communication with it was cut off. It was never
heard from again. Two weeks ago I sent Journeyman there. Now _he_ has
"been swallowed up in a mysterious silence."""
An exclamation burst from Brand's lips. Sub-Commander Journeyman!
"Senior officer under Stone, ablest man in the expeditionary forces,"
and Brand's oldest friend!
"Stone nodded comprehension of the stricken look on Brand's face. ""I"
"know how friendly you two were,"" he said soberly. ""That's why I chose"
"you to go and find out, if you can, what happened to him and the other"
"two ships."""
Brand's chin sank to rest on the stiff high collar of his uniform.
"""Journeyman!"" he mused. ""Why, he was like an older brother to me. And"
"now ... he's gone."""
*       *       *       *       *
There was silence in Commander Stone's sanctum for a time. Then Brand
raised his head.
"""Did you have any radio reports at all from any of the three ships"
"concerning the nature of the red spot?"" he inquired."
"""None that gave definite information,"" replied Stone. ""From each of"
the three ships we received reports right up to the instant when the
red area was approached. From each of the three came a vague
description of the peculiarity of the ground ahead of them: it seems
"He told her--he told her all he knew. She listened, horror-stricken,"
regarding him with open mouth and streaming eyes.
"“And what do you think is my duty?” asked John, abruptly."
Miss Lindon shook her head. “I 'm sure I don't know what to advise
"you, dear. I 'll try to find out some kind Christian people who want a"
servant.”
"“I don't want any kind Christian people at all,” said John. “I'm going"
to make up in ease and happiness for all the wrongs that humanity has
"inflicted on her. I am going to adopt her, educate her, fill her up with"
the good things of life.”
"“That's very fine of you, John,” said Miss Lindon. “Some people are"
as fond of their adopted children as of their own. I remember Miss
"Engleshaw adopted a little child. She was four, if I remember right,"
and she used to dress her so prettily. I used to go and help her choose
frocks. Really they were quite expensive. Now I come to think of
"it, John, I could help you that way with little Unity. I don't think"
gentlemen have much experience in choosing little girls' frocks. How old
is she?”
"“Nearly sixteen,” said John."
"“That's rather old,” said Miss Lindon, from whose mind this new interest"
seemed to have driven the tragic side of the question. “It's a pity you
could n't have begun when she was four.”
"“It is,” said John."
"“Only if you had begun with her at four, you would n't be wanting to"
"The moment she sat me down and walked slowly around me, I knew I was"
"in for it. ""I've been reading up on Venusian geography in the ship's"
"library,"" I told her in a hurry."
"""No doubt,"" she said drily. She shook her night-black hair out. ""But"
you aren't going to tell me that you read about _dunging_ in the ship's
library. The books there have been censored by a government agent of
Earth against the possibility that they might be read by susceptible
young male minds like yours. She would not have allowed--this Terran
"Agent--"""
"""Paddlefoot,"" I sneered."
"Sis sat down hard in our zoom-air chair. ""Now that's a term,"" she said"
"carefully, ""that is used only by Venusian riffraff."""
"""They're not!"""
"""Not what?"""
"""Riffraff,"" I had to answer, knowing I was getting in deeper all the"
time and not being able to help it. I mustn't give Mr. Brown away!

"a second pair of ears. ""Tell me more."""

But here the Rogan leader turned impatiently away. Greca had been
translating sentence by sentence. Now the tall one barked out a few
syllables in a squeaky voice.
"""He says he knows you are lying,"" sighed Greca. ""For if you on Earth"
have tubes more effective than theirs why weren't you equipped with
"them on your expedition here to the red kingdom?"""
"Brand bit his lips. ""Check,"" he muttered. ""The brute has a brain in"
"that ugly head."""
*       *       *       *       *
The Rogan leader spoke for a long time then; and at each singsong
"word, Greca quivered as though lashed by a whip. At length she turned"
to Brand.
"""He has been telling what his hordes can do, answering your boasts"
with boasts of his own. His words are awful! I won't tell you all he
said. I will only say that he is convinced his shock-tubes are
"superior to any Earth arms, and that he states he will now illustrate"
their power to you to quell your insolence. I don't know what he means
"by that...."""
But she and the Earthmen were soon to find out.
The Rogan leader stepped to the window and arrogantly beckoned Brand
and Dex to join him there. They did; and the leader gazed out and down
as though searching for something.
He pointed. The two Earthmen followed his leveled arm with their eyes

or get no good from the radioactivity. Then the best men went to the

"He told me about it. Women were scarce on Venus, and he hadn't been"
able to find any who were willing to come out to his lonely little
islands; he had decided to go to Earth where there was supposed to be a
"surplus. Naturally, having been born and brought up on a very primitive"
"planet, he didn't know ""it's a woman's world,"" like the older boys in"
school used to say.

The manufacturer and his wife got up.
Then the first man from Bergen made another speech.
*       *       *       *       *
"The manufacturer stayed with us for the promised three days, and then made"
ready to travel again. His mood never changed; he was contented and
entertaining the whole time. Every evening one whisky and soda was brought
"him--no more. Before their bedtime, his little girls had a wildly"
hilarious half-hour with him. At night a tremendous snoring could be heard
"from his cottage. Before his arrival, the little girls had spent a good"
"deal of time with me, but now they no longer knew I existed, so taken up"
with their father were they. He hung a swing for them between the two
"rowan trees in the field, taking care to pack plenty of rag under the rope"
so as not to injure the tree.
He also had a talk with Paul; there were rumors that he was intending to
"take his money out of the Tore Peak resort. Paul's head was bent now, but"
he seemed even more hurt that the manufacturer should have paid a visit to
the human world or the world of nature.
When the luncheon hour drew near there came a slight lull in the
uproar.
Maxwell stood by his desk with his hands full of telegrams and
"memoranda, with a fountain pen over his right ear and his hair hanging"
"in disorderly strings over his forehead. His window was open, for the"
beloved janitress Spring had turned on a little warmth through the
waking registers of the earth.
And through the window came a wandering—perhaps a lost—odour—a
"delicate, sweet odour of lilac that fixed the broker for a moment"
"immovable. For this odour belonged to Miss Leslie; it was her own, and"
hers only.
"The odour brought her vividly, almost tangibly before him. The world of"
finance dwindled suddenly to a speck. And she was in the next
room—twenty steps away.
"“By George, I’ll do it now,” said Maxwell, half aloud. “I’ll ask her"
now. I wonder I didn’t do it long ago.”
He dashed into the inner office with the haste of a short trying to
cover. He charged upon the desk of the stenographer.
"She looked up at him with a smile. A soft pink crept over her cheek,"
and her eyes were kind and frank. Maxwell leaned one elbow on her desk.
He still clutched fluttering papers with both hands and the pen was
above his ear.
"“Miss Leslie,” he began hurriedly, “I have but a moment to spare. I"
"Colonel Carmichael thrust her behind him, and an instant later she"
heard the report of his revolver. There was no answering volley. A
"dark, scantily-clad figure sprang through the trees, waving one hand"
as though in imperative appeal.
"""Don't fire--don't fire! It's me!"""
"The Colonel's still smoking revolver sank, and the supposed native"
"swayed toward him, only to sink a few yards farther on to the ground."
Carmichael ran to his side and lifted the fainting head against his
shoulder.
"""Good God, Geoffries! Don't say I've hit you! How on earth was I to"
"know!"""
"""That's all right, Colonel. Only winded--don't you know--never hurried"
so much in life. Have been in the midst of the beggars--just managed
"to slip through. O Lor', give me something to drink, will you?"""
Colonel Carmichael put his flask to the parched and broken lips.
"""Thanks, that's better. We got your message, and are coming on like"
fun. The regiment's only an hour off. You never saw Saunders in such a
"fluster--it's his first big job, you know."" He took another deep"
"draft, and wiped his mouth with the corner of his ragged tunic. ""I"
"say--don't look at me, Miss Lois. I'm not fit to be seen."" He laughed"
"hoarsely. ""These clothes weren't made in Bond Street, and Webb assured"
"me that the fewer I had the more genuine I looked. I say, Colonel,"
"this is a lively business!"""
Colonel Carmichael nodded as he helped the gasping and exhausted man

"and sibilant buzzing, and pipings that died down in faint wails. The"

soon re-emerged. It grew smaller and smaller. Our eyes lost it for a
moment and found it again. Then they lost it altogether and nothing
remained save the whitish blurs in the blue sky and a hardly audible
booming in the far distance.

"myself, the third Sunday I struck my Asok....  She was angry and"
threatened to summon me.  Just imagine if she had done so!  On the

interrupted Abyedok.
"""Ay, just so...  She looked after my house...."""
"""Did you have any children?"" asked the teacher."
"""Five of them....  One was drowned ... the oldest ... he was an amusing"

"of St. Petersburg and died there ... of consumption they say. Ye--es,"

"began explaining why this was so, and they laughed till they nearly"

A man cannot escape from his life even in death. In our acts of to-day
"we are determining what our death will be; if we have lived well, we"
"shall die well; and if not, then not. As a man lives so shall he die, is"
the teaching of Buddhism as of other creeds.
"So what Buddhism has to offer to the dying believer is this, that if he"
"live according to its tenets he will die happily, and that in the life"
"that he will next enter upon he will be less and less troubled by sin,"
"less and less wedded to the lust of life, until sometime, far away, he"
"shall gain the great Deliverance. He shall have perfect Peace, perfect"
"rest, perfect happiness, he and his, in that heaven where his teacher"
went before him long ago.
"And if we should say that this Deliverance from life, this Great Peace,"
"is Death, what matter, if it be indeed Peace?"

Sidney he admired the girl's gameness though he was beginning to wish
they had not let her come.
"""How long do you think we'll have to wait? And what if no one comes?"""
"""We'll have to wait until most morning anyway before the tide is out."
"And if no one comes tonight we'll have to come out again, that's all."
"We're not in this business for any fun!"""
"""Oh--h!"" sighed Pola, clinging closer to Sidney."
The wind howled over their heads with increasing velocity and Sidney
thought involuntarily of the snugness of Miss Letty's buggy. Miss Letty
was probably almost to Truro now. And Aunt Achsa thought she was with
her!
"""Is--is the boat tied tight?"" asked Pola; and Lav assured her that it"
"was. ""The wind could get a lot worse and you'd be as safe out here as"
"in your bed at home."""
"After a long while Mart muttered, ""What's that?"" The others leaned"
forward in the blackness of the cabin. They had all felt rather than
heard a soft thud as though something had touched the side of the boat.
And in a few moments heavy footsteps came straight toward the fo'castle.
"""Oh, will they come _here_?"" breathed Pola, shaking. And for answer"
Sidney caught Pola's arm with a warning clutch.
For an instant it seemed that the footsteps must descend to the cabin.
"But at the companionway they halted. A voice came, heavy and thick."
"""I tell you it ain't safe to take it off now. They got a man on"
"There was no one about, and a few children's faces at a window suddenly"
"disappeared. Everything here was small and poor, though only the barn was"
of peat; the house was a timbered fisherman's home. As I entered the
"house, I saw that though it was as poor within as without, the floor was"
clean and covered with pine twigs. There were many children here. The
mother was busy cooking something over the fire.
"I was offered a chair, and sitting down, began to chat with a couple of"
"small boys. As I was in no hurry and asked for nothing, the woman said:"
"""I expect you want a boat?"""
"""A boat?"" I said in my turn, for I had not come by boat on my last visit;"
I had walked instead over fjelds and valleys many miles from the sea.
"""Yes, why not?"" I said. ""But where does it go?"""
"""I thought you wanted a boat to go to the trading center,"" she replied,"
"""because that's where the steamer stops. We've rowed over lots of people"
"this year."""
Great changes here; the motor traffic in Stordalen must have completely
altered all the other traffic since my last visit ten months ago.
"""Where can I stop for a few days?"" I asked."
"""At the trading center, the other side of the islands. Or there's Eilert"
and Olaus; they're both on this side. You could go there; they've got big
"houses."""
"She showed me the two places on this side of the water, close to the"
"shore, and I proceeded thither."
Thus spoke the brave who was born and reared in the wigwams of the
tribe of the Manhattans.
"The girl, after leaving her entertainer, sped swiftly cross-town until"
"she arrived at a handsome and sedate mansion two squares to the east,"
facing on that avenue which is the highway of Mammon and the auxiliary
gods. Here she entered hurriedly and ascended to a room where a
handsome young lady in an elaborate house dress was looking anxiously
out the window.
"“Oh, you madcap!” exclaimed the elder girl, when the other entered."
“When will you quit frightening us this way? It is two hours since you
ran out in that rag of an old dress and Marie’s hat. Mamma has been so
"alarmed. She sent Louis in the auto to try to find you. You are a bad,"
thoughtless Puss.”
"The elder girl touched a button, and a maid came in a moment."
"“Marie, tell mamma that Miss Marian has returned.”"
"“Don’t scold, sister. I only ran down to Mme. Theo’s to tell her to use"
mauve insertion instead of pink. My costume and Marie’s hat were just
"what I needed. Every one thought I was a shopgirl, I am sure.”"
"“Dinner is over, dear; you stayed so late.”"
“I know. I slipped on the sidewalk and turned my ankle. I could not
"walk, so I hobbled into a restaurant and sat there until I was better."
That is why I was so long.”
"The two girls sat in the window seat, looking out at the lights and the"
"A door opened, and through it (though dimly) Rollo could see the great"
"waterfall glimmering and above the stars, chill over the snowy shoulder"
"of Peñalara. He could not make out who had opened the door, but there"
was enough light to discern that a lady wrapped in a mantilla went out
"first. Then followed another, stouter and of shorter stature, apparently"
carrying a burden. Then the whole doorway was obscured by the tall
figure of a man.
"""Muñoz himself, by Heaven!"" thought Rollo."
"And with a leap he was after him, in his headlong course dashing to the"
ground some other unseen person who confronted him in the hall.
In a moment more he had caught the tall man by the collar and swung him
impetuously round back within the doorway.
"""Move one sole inch and your blood be on your own head!"" he muttered."
"And the captive feeling Rollo's steel cold at his throat, remained"
prudently silent. Not so the lady without. She uttered a cry which rang
about the silent château.
"""Muñoz! My husband! Fernando, where art thou? Oh, they have slain him,"
"and I only am to blame!"""
"She turned about and rushed back to the door, which she was about to"
"enter, when a cry far more sudden and terrible rang out behind her."
"""_They have killed the Princess! Some one hath slain my darling!_"""
"At the word Rollo abandoned the man whom he was holding down, and with"
"shouts of ""Cardono!"" ""El Sarria!"" ""To me! They are upon us!"" he flung"
translation and they'd only have lost one day. What the hell. Use that
"as a fallback position. Time, that's all it would take, just a little"
more time.
"""But what does it matter? The game's up anyway."" He nodded toward Vera,"
"then turned to Eva, sending her a pointed signal."
"""What was it Shakespeare said about discretion and valor,"" she"
"concurred, understanding exactly what he was thinking."
"""The man knew when to fish and when to cut bait."""
"""True enough. Shall you tell them or shall I?"""
"""You can do the honors."""
"She walked over and picked up her briefcase. ""You didn't really think"
"we'd leave it, did you, Comrade? So just take it and good riddance. A"
little gift from the NSA. Who says America's getting stingy with its
"foreign aid?"""
"Comrade Karanova motioned for the two _kobun _to take the case. ""See if"
"it's there."""
"As they moved to comply, Vance found himself wondering if this really"
was going to turn off the heat. Somehow it no longer seemed adequate.
"""_Hai so_,"" he grunted through his teeth as he lifted it, ""something is"
"here."" Vance noticed that two digits of the little finger on his left"
"hand were missing, along with another digit on his ring finger. Good"

"""Take it easy,"" said Wilson, half-smiling."
"""Well, sir, we've been getting a lot of interference."""
Wilson looked up at the flickering dome. He merely nodded.
"""Well, sir--er--I was wondering if you could issue some--er--order to"
have the other ships move away? I'm sure we could find those lifeships
"if the rest of space were clear. But you've got three hundred--"""
"Wilson stared the youngster down coldly. ""Somewhere out there,"" he said"
"sourly, ""are two lifeships in which men, and a woman, are waiting for"
us to come and collect 'em. I'm combing space almost inch by inch. I
can hardly give up my squadron for a half-finished flash in the dome
"like this, can I?"""
"""No sir--ah--I suppose not."""
"""Then you live with the responses tossed back by my squadron. It'll be"
"good training for you. Er--get the hell out of my way!"""
The junior tech melted out of sight and went back to his control panel.
Weston came over within the hour. Ted Wilson explained the situation
and told Hugh to set up and measure the coordinates with respect to
the stellar centers. Then he told him to send a space scooter out to
investigate that spot.
Wilson went back to his own flagship wondering whether that fancy
infrawave detector would turn out to be anything. An untried doodad.
But now and then--
"uprooting of all your habits,” said he, in a softened voice."
"She smiled. “I can bring them with me,” she said cheerfully. “You won't"
"mind Dandy, will you? He'll soon get used to you. And as for Dickie,”"
"she added, with a touch of wistfulness, “I 'm sure I can find a nice"
home for him.”
John put his arm round her shoulder and gave her the kiss of a shy bear.
"“My good soul,” he cried, “bring fifty million Dickies if you like.” He"
laughed. “There's nothing like the song of birds for the humanizing of
the cockney child.”
"He looked around and beheld the little, gimcrack room with a new vision."
"After all, it was as much an expression of her individuality, and as"
"genuine in the eyes of the high gods, as Herold's exquisitely furnished"
"abode was of Herold's, or the untidy jumble of the room in Fenton Square"
was of his own. And all she had to live upon was a hundred and fifty
"pounds a year, and no artistic instincts or antecedents whatsoever."
“I feel a brute in asking you to give up this little place now that
"you've made it so pretty,” he said."
"Her face brightened at the praise. “It is pretty, is n't it?” Then she"
sighed as her eyes rested fondly on her possessions. “I suppose it would
be too tiny for us all to live here.”
"“I'm afraid it would,” said John. “Besides, we must live in London, on"
account of my work.”
“In London?”
"enough wisdom and courage to put this matter before the people?"""
"""Young man, I am not going to pass judgment on anyone in Washington or"
"elsewhere. Each of us, I'm sure, does his duty as he sees it."""
Again it seemed to Senator Crane that he heard a ripple of mirth--louder
this time. It had to be something to do with the acoustics. Except that
"he was suddenly aware of smiles, too. The next question had to do with"
possible consultation with Russia on the matter of the coming space
invasion.
Senator Crane agreed that such consultation should be made and then
retired hastily into seclusion. A touch of panic hit him. He felt like a
"man who was far out in the water without a boat, with the closest land a"
few hundred feet straight down. Good God! Had he miscalculated? Of
course not. He had only to await the verdict of the nation's top
newspapers before proceeding with the publicity program that might well
make him presidential timber.

"John Dennis, for the first time since Rhoda had known him, seemed"
nervous. He kept licking his lips and shifting his eyes from Rhoda to
Frank Corson.
"Frank Corson sat quietly, keeping his thoughts to himself. Rhoda crossed"
to the liquor cabinet and poured a double Scotch. She went to the sofa
and sat down a little uncertainly.
"""I guess you two haven't met. John, this is Frank Corson."""
"John Dennis paid no attention. He walked to the sofa, sat down, and took"
raining. He was a proud and comical sight. But why speak harsh words about
"a raincoat? It was not he, the owner, that had abused it, and it hung from"
his shoulders as innocently as a bridal veil.
"Why speak harsh words about anyone? Life is good, but life is stern."
"Perhaps when she comes out, I think to myself, the following scene will"
take place: I stand here waiting only for this departure. So she gives me
her hand and says good-bye.
"""Why don't you say something?"" she asks in order to seem bright and easy"
in her mind.
"""Because I don't want to hurt you in the great error of your ways."""
"""Ha, ha, ha,"" she laughs, too loudly and in a forced tone; ""the great"
"error of my ways! Well, really!"""
"And her anger grows, while I am assured and fatherly, standing on the firm"
ground of conscious virtue. Yet I say an unworthy thing like this:
"""Don't throw yourself away, Miss Torsen!"""
"She raises her head then; yes, the Torsen type would raise her head and"
"reply, pale and offended:"
"""Throw myself away?--I don't understand you."""
"But it is possible, too, that Miss Torsen, at heart a fine, proud girl,"
would have a lucid moment and see things in their true light:
"""Why not, why shouldn't I throw myself away? What is there to keep? I am"
"thrown away, wasted ever since my school days, and now I am seven and"
"_do_ you have to say about stowing away and using up lifeboat stores?"""
*       *       *       *       *
"He cocked his head and considered a moment. ""Look,"" he said finally,"
"""I have more than enough munit to pay for round trip tickets, but I"
couldn't get a return visa because of that brinosaur judge and all
the charges she hung on me. Had to stow away. Picked the _Eleanor
Roosevelt_ because a couple of the boys in the crew are friends of mine
and they were willing to help. But this lifeboat--don't you know that
every passenger ship carries four times as many lifeboats as it needs?
"Not to mention the food I didn't eat because it stuck in my throat?"""
"""Yes,"" she said bitterly. ""You had this boy steal fresh fruit for you."
I suppose you didn't know that under space regulations that makes him
"equally guilty?"""
"""No, Sis, he didn't,"" I was beginning to argue. ""All he wanted--"""
"""Sure I knew. Also know that if I'm picked up as a stowaway, I'll be"

We were in a narrow passage leading to the Stone Gallery in Whitehall. He
"looked about him a moment, then taking me by the arm, led me to the Stone"
"Gallery and thence to the garden. I wanted to stop, but he kept his grasp"
"on my arm, repeating now and then the word ""Come"" in whispers, till we"
"reached a lonely spot in St. James Park. There he halted, and though"
"there was not a living creature in sight, he brought his lips to my ear"
"and breathed the name, ""'Sieur George Hamilton."""
"I tried not to show that I was startled, but the quickwitted, sharp-eyed"
"Frenchman read me as though I were an open book, and grasping my hand,"
cried out:--
"""Ah, I knew you could tell me. It is to rejoice! I knew it!"""
"""Tell you what, count?"" I asked."
"""Tell me where your friend and mine is, or if you will not tell me, take"
"to him a letter. I have been trying to find him this fortnight."""
"""I cannot tell you where he is, my dear count--"""
"""Of course not! I do not ask,"" he interrupted."
"""--But I may be able to forward your letter to him. I heard only the"

"""Of course, of course, he is in France! Not in England at all! Good,"
good! I see you are to be trusted. But I must have your word of honor
"that the letter will be delivered."""
"""I shall send it by none but a trusted messenger,"" I answered, ""and shall"
return it to you unopened unless I am convinced beyond a doubt that it
"Understand?"""
"Viggon Sarri looked from one to the other, grimly. ""You believe I'm"
"wasting time? Is that it?"""
"The two aides answered together, ""Yes!"" and ""Absolutely!"""
"Viggon Sarri said, ""I am still in command of this force. We'll continue"
to observe until I am satisfied. You two officers have one common
idea--that of moving in fast. You have differing ideas of how we are
to move in. Until you can settle your difference and provide me with a
good logical basis for your decision--whichever way--then we'll follow
my plan. And my plan is to move in just as soon as we have enough data
on the character and strength of this race to provide us with the
"correct way to take them."""
"""Then you are going to continue stalling?"" demanded Naylo."
"""Yes, if you wish to call it stalling. Maybe another man might call it"
"planning."""
"""We'll be just wasting time, as I've already said. We have enough stuff"
"to take 'em right now."""
"Viggon Sarri shrugged. ""Yes. We could swoop in and take them like"
"mowing down a wheat field. Tell me, young men, what happens when you"
"mow down a wheat field."""
They looked at him blankly.
"Viggon smiled in a superior manner. ""One of two things, depending upon"
"how you operate. If you mow it down and let it lay, you drop seeds and"
"through."""
"She nodded, then stepped over and laid her weapon beside the bundles of"
securities. Vance took one last look at the Smith & Wesson in his own
hand and did the same. Even ex-archaeologists could do arithmetic.
All this time Vera Karanova had said nothing. She merely stood watching
"the proceedings with a detached smile. Finally she spoke. ""Now we can"
"proceed with the counting,"" she said calmly."
"""Maybe you don't fully grasp the situation here, comrade."" Vance stared"
"at her. ""Those gorillas aren't dropping in for tea. We've got to stand"
"together."""
"She burst out laughing. ""Mr. Vance, you are truly naive. No, you're"
worse. You actually thought you could sabotage the most powerful new
"global alliance of the twentieth century."" Her dark eyes were gradually"
"turning glacial. ""It will not be allowed to happen, believe me."""
"My God, he realized, that's why she wanted to get her hands on the"
"protocol. To deep-six it. She's been biding her time, stringing us"
along. And today she managed to stall us long enough for Mino's boys to
figure out the switch. She's no longer working for T-Directorate; she's
part of Tanzan Mino's operation. All this time she's been working with
them.
"""The negotiable certificates in this room will be delivered to their"

"Sis nodded to herself, waved the door open, and walked out."
"""Let's hope,"" the Captain said. ""Like any father used to say, a man who"
"knows how to handle women, how to get around them without their knowing"
"it, doesn't need to know anything else in this life. I'm plain wasted"
"in space. You can lower your hands now, son."""
We sat down and I explained the blaster to him. He was very interested.
He said all Butt had told him--in the lifeboat when they decided to
use my arrest as a club over Sis--was to keep the safety catch all the
way up against his thumb. I could see he really had been excited about
"carrying a lethal weapon around. He told me that back in the old days,"
"captains--sea captains, that is--actually had the right to keep guns"
in their cabins all the time to put down mutinies and other things our
ancestors did.
"The telewall flickered, and we turned it on. Sis smiled down."
"""Everything's all right, Captain. Come up and marry us, please."""
"""What did you stick him for?"" he asked. ""What was the price?"""
"Sis's full lips went thin and hard, the way Mom's used to. Then she"
"thought better of it and laughed. ""Mr. Brown is going to see that I'm"
"elected sheriff of the Galertan Archipelago."""
"""And I thought she'd settle for a county clerkship!"" the Captain"
muttered as we spun up to the brig.
The doors were open and girls were chattering in every corner. Sis came
up to the Captain to discuss arrangements. I slipped away and found
"""_That_ was my daughter,"" Mrs. Warren informed him with pride...."
"""She is a lady who has taken a high degree at an English University."
She has been an important person in the English feminist movement.
"When this dreadful war is over, I and my daughter will--"""
"At this juncture Vivie entered. ""_Mother_, I hope you haven't"
"missed me, haven't been unwell?"" she said, looking rather"
"questioningly at the little glass of Schnapps, only half of which"
had been drunk.
"""Well yes, dear, I have. _Terrible_ low spirits and all swimmy-like."
Thought I was going to faint. But this man here has been so kind
"""--her tears flowed afresh--""We've bin talking of old times; he used"
"to know me before--"""
"_Vivie_: ""Quite so. But I think, dear, we had better be going back."
I want to talk to you about the new rooms I've seen. Are you equal
to walking? If not perhaps this kind man would try to get us a
"cab...?"""
"But Mrs. Warren said it was no distance, only round the corner, and"
she could well walk. When they got back she would go and lie down.
"Vivie, reading her mother's thoughts, pressed a five-franc note into"
"the gardener's not reluctant palm, and they regained the Rue Royale."
But just as they were passing through the revolving door of the
"Hotel Impérial, a German who had been installed as manager came up"
"with two soldiers and said explosively: ""Heraus! Foutez-nous le"
"camp! Aout you go! Don't show your face here again!"""
"""But,"" said Vivie, ""our notice doesn't expire till the end of this"
"Then, after an interminable time, Miss Craig called out cheerily;"
"""There, that's enough for this morning,"" and came down to the dory,"
opening a little crocheted bag. From it she took two crisp one dollar
"bills. ""Take this, girls, and divide it. And we are ever so"
"grateful--you were splendid types. We'll have you again some day."""
Sidney's hand had barely closed over her dollar bill when she spied a
"woman and a girl slowly walking along the wharf, watching with interest"
the artists who were still at work. The girl looked startlingly
familiar to Sidney. She gave a little gasp and ran forward.
"""_Pola!_"" she called loudly."
"The girl turned in astonishment at the sound of her name, stared for a"
"moment, then quickly advanced laughing."
"""Why, you're the Romley girl, aren't you? Of _all_ the things! What are"
"you doing here?"""
"""I'm visiting my aunt,"" explained Sidney, suddenly conscious of her"
appearance and in consequence painfully ill-at-ease.
"""Oh, and do they hire you to pose? What fun! I suppose that's a sort of"
"costume they make you wear, isn't it?"""
"""Y--yes,"" Sidney faltered, miserably. Pola's manner was prettily"
condescending and she made no move to join Sidney on the beach.
"""I'm a wreck myself,"" Pola went on, airily surveying her trim and"
"elegant person. ""Mother and I are motoring. And I made her bring me"
down here to see my cousin. He's an artist and lives here summers.
He'll just despise seeing us because he comes here to get rid of
But the wiry man was stronger than he looked. With a twist he rolled
over and pinned Vance's shoulders against the carpet. Vance felt the
"shag, soft against his skin, and couldn't believe how chilly it felt."
"But now he had his hand on the _kobun's_ throat, holding him in a"
powerful grip while jamming a free elbow against the holster.
Cut off his oxygen. Don't let him breathe.
"The old moves were coming back, the shortcuts that would bring a more"
powerful opponent to submission. He pressed a thumb against the man's
"windpipe, shutting off his air. A look of surprise went through the"
"_kobun's_ eyes as he choked, letting his hold on Vance's shoulders"
slacken.
Now.
He shoved the man's arm aside and reached for the holster. Then his
hand closed around the hard grip of the Llama. The Japanese was weaker
"now, but still forcing his arm away from the gun, preventing him from"
getting the grip he needed.
"He rammed an elbow against the man's chin, then tightened his finger on"
the grip of the Llama. He almost had it.
"With his other hand he shoved the _kobun_'s face away, clawing at his"
"eyes, and again they rolled over, with the Japanese once more against"
the carpet. But now he had the gun and he was turning.
"He felt a sharp jab in his back, a flash of pain that seemed to come"
"from nowhere. It was both intense and numbing, as though his spine had"
"been caught in a vise. Then he felt his heart constrict, his"

Lav crawled to the top of the companion ladder but a muttering like a
human voice drove him back. Queer sounds struck upon their sensitized
ears. And the boat seemed to lift to a new motion.
They waited for an interminable time. Then Mart spoke quickly.
"""Lav, we're moving!"""
"Lav needed no warning. He, too, had missed the pull of the boat on the"
anchor rope. He shot up the ladder.
"""Oh, what's the matter?"" cried Sidney and Pola, forgetting all caution."
"Mart had no time to explain her fears. In an instant Lav was back,"
fairly throwing himself into the cabin.
"""We're drifting! They cut the anchor rope! We're drifting out! Fast!"
"Way out! To sea!"""
"That had been the ""better scheme."" To cut the _Arabella_ free from its"
mooring and let the wind and tide carry it out into the bay. At first
Starrow had not favored the plan; he had declared that it was too much
"risk, that the wind was shifting and freshening fast and that the old"
"tub might open a seam, but Joe Josephs had convinced him with: ""the"
_Arabella_ would be good for a week out in a nastier sea than this.
It's safer than riskin' runnin' afoul one of Phin Davies' men ashore.
Guthrie's _Sally_'ll stand this squall and pick up the _Arabella_ easy
"and we can reckon sure on the course the old tub'll take, even 'lowin'"
"for the wind to shift."""
As she comprehended what had happened Pola screamed. Mart and Sidney
"There young Charles was waiting for him. Carefully, as though"
"everything depended on it, he was tucking a towel round the hot-water"
can. Young Charles had been a favourite of his ever since as a little
red-faced boy he had come into the house to look after the fires. Old
"Mr. Neave lowered himself into the cane lounge by the window, stretched"
"out his legs, and made his little evening joke, “Dress him up,"
"Charles!” And Charles, breathing intensely and frowning, bent forward"
to take the pin out of his tie.
"H’m, h’m! Well, well! It was pleasant by the open window, very"
pleasant—a fine mild evening. They were cutting the grass on the tennis
court below; he heard the soft churr of the mower. Soon the girls would
begin their tennis parties again. And at the thought he seemed to hear
"Marion’s voice ring out, “Good for you, partner.... Oh, _played_,"
"partner.... Oh, _very_ nice indeed.” Then Charlotte calling from the"
"veranda, “Where is Harold?” And Ethel, “He’s certainly not here,"
"mother.” And Charlotte’s vague, “He said—”"
"Old Mr. Neave sighed, got up, and putting one hand under his beard, he"
"took the comb from young Charles, and carefully combed the white beard"
"over. Charles gave him a folded handkerchief, his watch and seals, and"
spectacle case.
"“That will do, my lad.” The door shut, he sank back, he was alone...."
And now that little ancient fellow was climbing down endless flights
"that led to a glittering, gay dining-room. What legs he had! They were"
"like a spider’s—thin, withered."
"“You’re an ideal family, sir, an ideal family.”"
"But if that were true, why didn’t Charlotte or the girls stop him? Why"
"hands and arms a long pair of motoring doeskin gloves. By George, she"
"was a winner—in general looks, though. Well, something about the clerk,"
"I suppose, must have aroused her suspicions. For, a moment later, she"
was gone in the crowd. Evidently she had thought of the danger and had
picked out a time when the lobby would be full and everybody busy. But
she did not leave by the front entrance through which she entered. I
concluded that she must have left by one of the side street carriage
doors.”
“And she got away?”
“Yes. I found that she asked one of the boys at the door to crank up a
"car standing at the curb. She slid into the seat, and was off in a"
minute.”
Kennedy said nothing. But I knew that he was making a mighty effort to
restrain comment on the bungling amateur detective work of the son of
our client.
"Reginald saw the look on his face. “Still,” he hastened, “I got the"
number of the car. It was 200859 New York.”
“You have looked it up?” queried Kennedy quickly.
“I didn’t need to do it. A few minutes later Dr. Rae Wilson herself
came out—storming like mad. Her car had been stolen at the very door of
the hotel by this woman with the innocent aid of the hotel employees.”
Kennedy was evidently keenly interested. The mention of the stolen car
had apparently at once suggested an idea to him.
"“Mrs. Blake,” he said, as he rose to go, “I shall take this letter with"
the bottom a la log.
“Here we go!” shouted Frank.
The boys raced along the slope until they came to a point of timber
"which, following a more fertile spot, thrust itself up the ascent. Here"
"they disappeared, considering themselves reasonably safe in the"
seclusion of the forest. Frank examined his gun and found it empty.
“Good thing that dub didn’t know it was empty!” he laughed.
“Don’t stop now to throw bouquets at yourself!” grinned Harry.
“That’s right!” Jack declared. “We want to be getting back to the camp.
Gilroy’ll have a fit if he wakes up and finds us gone.”
"“Don’t you ever think those half-breeds will give up the chase here,”"
"Frank suggested. “Do you know what they’ll do?” he asked, “They’ll"
circle around and get between us and the camp! That’s what they’ll do.”
"“I sometimes think,” Harry snorted, turning to Jack, “that Frank is"
getting so intelligent that he may have the gift of speech conferred
upon him. He certainly has that proposition right.”
"“Well, if we can’t go back to camp,” Jack asked, “where can we go?”"
“We’ll have to glide into some gentle dell in the bosom of a friendly
"hill!” laughed Harry, “and send a scout out to watch those fellows spy"
upon the camp.”
“If they’ve got a detachment of half-breeds guarding every squad of Boy
"Scouts that have strayed away from the camp today,” Jack laughed, “they"
"By mutual consent, Mrs. Carmichael and Beatrice ceased to talk, but"
"when suddenly there was a movement close to them, and a dim light"
"flashed over the partition, they exchanged a glance of meaning."
"""That is my husband,"" Mrs. Carmichael whispered. ""Something is going"
"to happen. Listen!"""
She was not wrong in her supposition. The Colonel had entered the next
"room, followed by Nicholson and Saunders, and had closed the door"
carefully after him. All three men carried lanterns. They glanced
instinctively at the wooden partition which divided them from the four
"women, but Carmichael shook his head."
"""It's all right,"" he said. ""They must be fast asleep, poor souls."
"Let's have a look at these fellows."" He went over to a huddled-up"
figure lying in the shadow. The corner of a military cloak had been
thrown over the face. He drew it on one side and then let it drop.
"""Gone!"" he said laconically. He passed on to the next. There were in"
"all three men ranged against the wall. Two of them were dead. ""Martins"
"told me they couldn't last,"" Colonel Carmichael muttered. ""It is"
"better for them. They are out of it a little sooner, that's all."" The"
"third man was Travers. He lay on his back, his face turned slightly"
"toward the wall, his eyes closed. He seemed asleep. The Colonel nodded"
"somberly. ""Another ten hours,"" he calculated."
"He came back to the table, where the others waited, and drew out a"
paper from his pocket.
"""Give me your light a moment, Nicholson,"" he said."
No one spoke while he examined the list before him. All around them
"grounds, chatting and sipping tea, I was watching, watching. And my hand"
"was never far from the butt of the Webley automatic which, slung from my"
"waist, was hidden in a bag of silk."""
"""Heavens!"" he cried out. ""You are...."""
"""Hush,"" interposed Madame. ""A lawyer and a Gatepath should be more"
"discreet. The war is over, and I can tell you now that I fought every"
"minute of it in the Secret Service, the Civil branch. I was the head"
"woman, the bright particular star, in Dawson's Secret Corps."""
"""Is it discreet to tell me this?"" he asked, countering her reproof of a"
moment earlier.
"She smiled rather wickedly. ""Are you not a lawyer and a Gatepath? And"
"can one not tell anything to a lawyer and a Gatepath? Besides, I have"
"sent in my resignation, and am now a free woman. It has been a good"
"time, a very good time. I have fought devils and mastered devils in"
"England and France and Italy for four long years, and now I would rest."
You say that time and sorrow have spared me. Yet I have known both time
"and sorrow. Have I not lost...."""
"He broke into a babble of apologies. ""I did not know.... I did not"
"realise...."""
"She waved a hand, and he fell silent. ""I do not wear the trappings of"
"woe, for though I am eternally widowed, I glory in my loss. It was in"
"the rearguard at Caporetto, when all less gallant souls had fled, that"
"my Guilberti fell."""
Of course from that moment Gatepath was her slave. She had flattered him
and humbugged him as she flattered and humbugged all of us. Madame had
She ate alone that evening.
"""Isn't your husband coming in?"" asked the woman of the house."
"""Perhaps he doesn't want anything,"" she replied."
"There he stood, away by the tiny barn pretending to be interested in the"
"roof, in the style of building, and walked round looking at it, pursing"
his lips and whistling. But she could see perfectly well from the window
"that his face was blue and dejected. When she had eaten, she walked down"
"to the shore, calling as she passed him:"
"""Go in and eat!"""
"But he had not sunk quite so low; he would not go in to eat, and slept"
towards the papers in the seed-tray.
“You have great strength of character. You will marry a red-haired man

tell you is not the truth I am liable to have my licence taken away

chest; the sweat pours down his face into his paper collar; his eyes
look glazed. When he takes off his hat there is a deep pucker of angry
flesh on his forehead. Nobody buys a watch.
Look out again! A huge barouche comes swinging down the hill with two

"“Surely you must know, Aunt Gladys. I 've been wandering through hell"
with a pack of little devils at my heels.”
"Startled, she lifted up her arms and dropped Dandy, who slithered down"
her dress and sought a morose shelter under the table.
“My dear John!” she exclaimed.
"“I'm very sorry; I did n't mean to use strong language,” said he,"
putting his hands to his ears. “It's all that infernal canary.”
"“Oh, poor Dickie! Don't you like to hear Dickie sing? He sings so"
"beautifully. The gas-man was here the other day and said that, if I"
"liked, he would enter him for a competition, and he was sure he would"
"get first prize. But if you don't like to hear him, dear--though I"
really can't understand why--I can easily make him stop.” She drew a
white napkin from the drawer of the table on which the cage was placed
and threw it over the top. The feathered steam-whistle swallowed his din
"in an angry gurgle or two and became silent “Poor Dickie, he thinks it"
"'s a snowstorm! What were we talking about, John? Do sit down.”"
"John resumed his seat on the slippery couch, and Miss Lindon, having"
"snatched Dandy from his lair, sat by his side, depositing the dog"
between them.
"“You asked me what I had been doing for the last few years,” said he."
"She threw up her hand suddenly, as if she were about to vent on him"
"all the passions which consumed her--the terror, rage, and shame which"
"swelled in her breast. But something in his gibing tone, something in"
the set lines of his figure--she could not see his face--checked her.
"She let her hand fall in a gesture of despair, and shrank into"
"herself, shuddering. She looked at him as at a serpent--that"
fascinated her. At last she murmured--
'You will not dare. What have they done to you?'
"'Nothing,' he answered. 'It is not their affair; it is yours.'"
For a moment after that they stood confronting one another while the
"sound of the women sobbing in a corner, and the occasional jingle of a"
"bridle outside, alone broke the silence. Behind her the room was dark;"
"behind him, through the open windows, lay the road, glimmering pale"
"through the dusk. Suddenly the door at her back opened, and a bright"
light flashed on his face. It was Marie Wort bringing in a lamp. No
"one spoke, and she set the lamp on the table, and going by him began"
"to close the shutters. Still the Countess stood as if turned to stone,"
and he stood watching her.
"'Where are they?' she moaned at last, though he had already told her."
"'In the camp,' he said."
'Can I--can I see them?' she panted.
"'Afterwards,' he answered, with the smile of a fiend; 'when you are my"
wife.'
hands. Everything living had been slain. Astura was a castle of the
dead.
"""God! What work!"" exclaimed the Pisan. It was the testimony wrung from"
him by the stress of sheer hard fighting.
"""One of the viper-brood still lives,"" the duke turned to his"
"companion, kicking with the tip of his steel boot the lifeless form of"
Giovanni Frangipani.
The Pisan turned to a man-at-arms.
"""Take twenty men! Scour the lair from vault to pinnacle! We must have"
"that other,--dead or alive!"""
The rain had ceased for the time. New thunder-clouds came rolling out
of the west. Flambeaux flared in the court. Black shadows danced along
the ghostly walls. The wind moaned about the crenelated turrets;
"sentinels of the Pisans stood everywhere, alert for ambush."
The duke and his companions approached the door leading into the great
hall. It lay in splinters. Stygian darkness held sway within.
"Suddenly the duke paused, as if turned to stone, at the same time"
plucking his companion back by the sleeve of his surcoat.
Noiselessly as a ghost out of the door came the form of a woman. She
"was tall, exquisitely proportioned, and young. For a moment she paused"
on the threshold and looked out into the night. Almost immediately a
"second form followed, and paused near the first: that of a man. The"
"woman seemed to stare blindly at the duke, with wide, unseeing eyes,"
as one who walks in a sleep.
He shook his head.
"""Well, there was a certain shrewd old cannery-man in Washington State"
"whose catch consisted almost wholly of pink fish. As you know, that"
"variety does not bring as high a price as red salmon, like these. Well,"
"finding that he could not sell his catch, owing to the popular"
"prejudice about color, this man printed a lot of striking can-labels,"
"which read, 'Best Grade Pink Salmon, Warranted not to Turn Red in the"
"Can.' They tell me it worked like a charm."""
"""No wonder!"" Boyd laughed, beginning to feel the tension of his nerves"
"relax at the restfulness of her influence. As usual, he fell at once"
into the mood she desired for him. He saw that her brows were furrowed
"and her rosy lips drawn into an unconscious pout as she said, more to"
herself than to him:
"""I wish I were a man. I'd like to engage in a business of this sort,"
something that would require ingenuity and daring. I'd like to handle
"big affairs."""
"""It seems to me that you are in a business of that sort. You are one of"
"us."""
"""Oh, but you and George are doing it all."""
"""There is your copper-mine. You surely handled that very cleverly."""
"Cherry's expression altered, and she shot a quick glance at him as he"
went on:
"""How is it coming along, by-the-way? I haven't heard you mention it"
"twenty...."""
My own thoughts run away with me as I stand there wishing I were somewhere
"else. Perhaps she, too, in her room wishes me far away."
"""Good-bye,"" I say to the actor. ""Will you remember me to Miss Torsen? I"
"must go now."""
"""Good-bye,"" says he, shaking hands in some surprise. ""Can't you wait a few"
"minutes? Well, all right, I'll give her your greeting. Good-bye,"
"good-bye."""
"I take a short cut to get out of the way, and as I know every nook and"
"corner, I am soon outside the farm, and find a good shelter. From here I"
shall see when these two leave. She has only to say good-bye now to the
people of the farm.
It struck me that yesterday was the last time I spoke to her. We spoke
"only a few insignificant words that I have forgotten, and today I have not"
spoken to her....
Here they come.
Curious--they seemed somehow to have become welded together; though they
"walked separately up the mountain track, yet they belonged together. They"
did not speak; the essential things had probably already been said. Life
had grown ordinary for them; it still remained to them to be of use to
"each other. He walked first, while she followed many paces behind; it was"
lonely to look at against the rugged background of the mountain. Where had
her tall figure gone to? She seemed to have grown shorter because she had
hitched up her skirt and was carrying her knapsack on her back. They each
"carried one, but he carried hers and she his, probably because, owing to"
mix the hats.... Ha-ha!” He laughed mock-tragically. “This night must
never be forgotten!”
"“It never will,” said Blotte; and laughing grimly he got striding again"
"in the red wig, as Fluffy Reubens and Doome burst into the room."
"“Here, Fluffy,” said Rippley, “quick, man! put on this yellow wig, and"
"comb it well over your eyes. There isn’t a moment to be lost; Doome,"
here’s a black moustache and a greyish wig--this is the way to stick it
on--see? Splendid! Makes you look like a broken-down Italian tenor.”
He searched about in the cabinet and found a stubbly black wig which he
"pulled over his own hair, and was at once a son of France:"
"“Look here, boys, I’m head-waiter, see! And when I bow, you bow: and"
"when I rub my hands, you rub your hands; and don’t forget the foreign"
"accent--try to talk English as you used to talk French.... Doome, you"
"stand at the landing below, and see that old Dukes don’t stir a step"
"from the door--and bawl up the names from him. And you, Fluffy, play"
the general ass. I’ll stick to the door here.... Are we all right
"now?... No, Blotte’s not enough disguised. Here, Doome, fasten this"
"fierce moustache on his lip, whilst I shut up.... O lor! here they"
come!”
Rippley had scarcely hurried into his coat when there entered and
halted in the great doorway a hesitating figure in the white satin
"dress of a courtier of Charles the First, lace frills at his weak"
"knees, white stockings, white shoes, and holding a plumed hat in his"
hand.
"His eyeglass dropped out of his eye, and he stood there stuttering and"
aghast.
pillow.
I held my breath.  The awful truth was distinctly apparent.  I placed my
"hand upon her heart, the bodice of her dress being already unloosened."
"Then a few seconds later I drew back, standing rigid and aghast."
"""Why, she's dead!""  I gasped."
"""Yes,"" the Countess said, covering her face with her hands and bursting"
"into tears.  ""My poor Yolande! she is dead--_dead_!"""
The discovery appalled me.  Only a couple of hours before we had chatted
"together, and she seemed in the best of health and spirits, just as in"
"the old days, until I had made the announcement of Wolf's presence in"
Paris.  The effect of that statement upon her had apparently been
"electrical.  Why, I knew not.  Had she not implored me to save her?"
This in itself was sufficient to show that she held him in deadly fear.
"Again I bent in order to make further examination, but saw the"
unmistakable mark of death upon her countenance.  The lower jaw had
"dropped, the checks were cold, and the silver hand-mirror which I had"
snatched from the table and held at her mouth was unclouded.  There was
"no movement--no life.  Yolande, my well-beloved of those long-past days,"
was dead.
I stood there at the bedside like a man in a dream.  So swiftly had she
been struck down that the terrible truth seemed impossible of
realisation.
"The Countess, standing beside me, sobbed bitterly.  Truly the scene in"
that darkened chamber was a strange and impressive one.  Never before in
my whole life had I been in the presence of the dead.
Dawson spoke with less than his usual cheery confidence. I fancy that
the thinness and whiteness of his face were not wholly due to
disguise. He had not been to bed since he had been called up in the
"middle watch of the night before last, and the man was worn out."
"""If you take my poor advice, Dawson,"" I said, ""you will cut off now"
and get some sleep. Even your brain cannot work continuously without
"rest. The country needs you at your best, and needs you very badly"
"indeed."""
"His dull, weary eyes lighted as if under the stimulus of champagne,"
and he turned upon me a look which was almost affectionate. I really
"began to believe that Dawson likes me, that he sees in me a kindred"
spirit as patriotically unscrupulous as himself.
"He jumped up and gripped my hand. ""You are right. I will put in a few"
hours' sleep and then to work once more. This time I am up against a
"man who is nearly as smart as I am myself, and I can't afford to carry"
"any handicap."""
"I led him to the door and put him out, and then turned to Cary with a"
"laugh. ""And I, too, will follow Dawson's example. It is past one, and"
"my head is buzzing with queer ideas. Perhaps, after all, the Germans"
"have more imagination than we usually credit them with. I wonder--"""
But I did not tell to Cary what I wondered.
*       *       *       *       *
"We were sitting after breakfast in Cary's study, enjoying the first"
"sweet pipe of the day, when the telephone bell rang. Cary took off the"
earpiece and I listened to a one-sided conversation somewhat as
follows:--
"'Guffin.'  And hevery skipper was the 'Guffin,' new and old, go or"
"stay.  But when we broke hoff to hargue, why, we was talkin' about"
them French jossers and whether Sallis-bury was a-goin' to let 'em
"chip into our game and straddle the Nile."""
"""That's so,"" said the crowd, and the House was rough."
"Meanwhile, the skipper, or ""old man"" (who henceforward, by the way,"
"was called the ""Guffin""), and his two mates were discussing the"
"latest aspect of world politics, as they drank whiskey and water."
"""What's wrong with Salisbury,"" said the Guffin, who was as stout as a"
"barrel and as sturdy, ""is, that he ain't got a backbone.  He just"
lets 'em blow him about like so much paper.  What he wants is
"stiffenin': he's like a sprung spar.  That's what he's like."""
"The mate, a tough-looking dog with hair like anæmic tussac grass in"
"patches on his face, shook his head."
"""I've a greater opinion of him, captain, than you have.  All his"
double shuffle is cunning.  It's getting back so's to lead them
"French on.  Mark me, he'll play them yet a fair knock-out."""
The Guffin sneered.
"""He may have cunnin', Lampert, but he ain't no real tact.  Now,"
"diplomatic tact, I take it, is not givin' way into the gutter, but"
just showin' as you're a nice pleasant-spoken chap as don't mean to
be put on.  It's my good opinion as these foreigners don't yearn to
"fight us.  And men like you and me, Lampert, gets to learn the way of"
handlin' foreigners.  Who has so much experience with 'em as them in
"command of English ships?"""
Pola ate with nervous greed. Sidney bit off a piece but found it dry in
her mouth. She was thinking of her sisters and the safety of the dear
old house; as vividly as though it hung in a picture before her eyes
"she saw the little circle around the dining room table, the embroidered"
"square of Indian cloth, the green shaded lamp, Issy's books and Trude's"
"sewing, Vick's sketching things, the girls at their beloved tasks--and"
"her chair empty! Oh, what if she never sat again in that dear circle?"
Her heart broke in an agony of longing for Trude.
A sudden thought roused Pola to a feeble show of spirit.
"""If I had known how to swim we'd all be ashore now! And you two stayed"
"with me! I--I don't believe I'm worth that, girls."" She spoke with"
gloomy conviction.
But Mart answered with a promptness that settled that question forever.
"""Forget it. Why, you don't think we could a' done anything else, do"
you? And now I'm going up on deck and get some air. We must be most to
"Halifax by this time."""
"""_Halifax!_"" But this time Pola did not scream."
*       *       *       *       *
"Lavender, after his first plunge, had struck out toward the lighthouse."
His Mr. Dugald had taught him the science of swimming and because it
"was the one thing he could do easily and well, in spite of his"
"misshaped body, Lavender had taken pride in perfecting the practice."
"His assurance helped him now; he had no fear, he knew how to save his"
"strength; he swam first with one stroke, then with another, always"
keeping in sight the beacon of light.
"""Welcome to the wonderful world of Tanzan Mino. I don't know where the"
"hell we are, but it's definitely not Kansas, or London."""
"""My head feels like I was at ground zero when the bomb hit. My whole"
"body aches."" She groaned and plopped back down on the futon. ""What time"
"do you think it is?"""
"""Haven't a clue. How about starting with what day?"" He felt for his"
"watch and realized it was gone. ""What does it matter anyway? Nobody has"
"clocks in never-never land."""
"Satisfied she was okay, he stood up and surveyed the room. Then he saw"
"what he'd expected. There in the center of the ceiling, integrated into"
"the pattern of light-colored woods, was the glass eye of a video"
camera.
And the music. Still the faint music.
He walked on down to the far end of her room and shoved aside another
"set of sliding doors, also painted with the double-ax insignia. He"
"found himself looking at a third large space, this one paneled in raw"
"cypress. It was vast, and in the center was a cedar hot tub, sunk into"
"the floor. The water was fresh and steaming, and two tiny stools and"
rinsing pails were located conveniently nearby on the redwood decking.
"It was a traditional _o-furo_, one of the finest he'd ever seen."
"""You're not going to believe this."" He turned back and waved her"
forward. In the soft rice-paper glow of the lamp she looked rakishly
disheveled. Japanese architecture always made him think of lovemaking.
"""Our host probably figured we'd want to freshen up for the festivities."
"Check it out."""
"""You know what I mean. They probably don't realize it yet, but you're"
going to end up with the Soviet Far East in your wallet. For the price
"of a hot airplane, you get to plunder the region. They're even going to"
be thanking you while you reclaim Sakhalin for Japan. This _Daedalus_
spaceship is going to cost them the ranch. Have to admit it's
brilliant. Along with financing the whole scheme by swindling Benelux
"tax dodgers."""
"""You are too imaginative for your own good, Dr. Vance,"" he said, a thin"
"smile returning. ""Nobody is going to believe your interpretation of the"
"protocol."""
"""You've got a point. Nobody appreciates the true brilliance of a"
"criminal mind. Or maybe they just haven't known you as long as I have."""
"""Really, I'd hoped we would not descend to trading insults."" He reached"
"to refill Vance's sake saucer. ""It's demeaning. Instead I'd hoped we"
"could proceed constructively."""
"""Why not."""
"""Well then, perhaps you'll forgive me if I'm somewhat blunt. I'm afraid"
my time is going to be limited over the next few hours. I may as well
tell you now that we are about to have the first hypersonic test of the
_Daedalus_. Tomorrow morning we will take her to Mach 25. Seventeen
thousand miles per hour. A speed almost ten times greater than any air-
"breathing vehicle has ever before achieved."""
"""The sky's the limit,"" he whistled quietly. Alex hadn't known the half"
of it. This was the ultimate plane.
"""Impressive, I think you'll agree."" Mino smiled and poured more sake"
power. At that a terrible feeling of hopelessness assailed him. His only
chance was to reach the valley where he had little fear of capture; but
"wounded, as he was, that seemed out of the question, and he saw himself"
caught like a rat in a trap. In an access of rage at the situation in
which he was placed he made another effort to raise himself up on his
elbow and peer through the window at the Sierras. The noise that he
"made, slight though it was, awoke the Girl. In an instant she was at his"
bedside drawing the curtain over the window.
"""What you thinkin' of?"" she asked. ""At any moment--jest as soon as the"
trail can be cleared--there'll be someone of the boys up here to see how
"I've pulled through. They mustn't see you . . ."""
"Forcibly, but with loving tenderness, she put him back among his pillows"
and seated herself by the bed. An awkward silence followed. For now that
the man was in his right senses it was borne in upon her that he might
"remember that she had fed him, given him drink and fondled him. It was a"
situation embarrassing to both. Neither knew just what to say or how to
"begin. At length, the voice from the bed spoke:"
"""How long have I been here?"""
"""Three days."""
"""And you have nursed me all that--"""
"""You mustn't talk,"" warned the girl. ""It's dangerous in more ways than"
"one. But if you keep still no one'll suspect that you're here."""
"""But I must know what happened,"" he insisted with increasing excitement."
"""I remember nothing after I came down the ladder. The Sheriff--Rance--"
"what's become . . .?"""
"""It is nothing to laugh at,"" grumbled Gatepath."
"""Not for you, perhaps. But to my mind the situation is gorgeous. Has"
"this man the legal right of succession?"""
"""Beyond a doubt,"" groaned Gatepath. ""His father saw to that."""
"""Then why not leave matters to take their legal course?"" asked the"
"Chief, still laughing. ""The House of Lords will be the better for a"
shock. They are a dull lot. And your lively friend will administer the
"shock all right."""
"Roger Gatepath spread out his hands in agony. ""But it is one of the"
"oldest peerages in the country, as old almost as the Barony of Arundel."
Can't you see how frightful it will be for the family if this--this
"person--is allowed to succeed?"""
"""There is no question of allowing him. If he is the legal heir he must"
succeed. The family must just put him in their pipe and smoke him. What
"else can they do?"""
"""I thought that you, with all your experience of the South, might"
suggest something. Would it not be possible to buy the man off--or might
"he not----"""
"""How can you buy him off when he is the heir? You people are nothing but"
"trustees, who must account to him for every penny. If he claims the"
"peerage and estates, you must accept him. You admit that legally he is"
"the heir. I can see what is in your mind, but it won't do, Gatepath, it"
"won't do. If you try any hanky-panky, that pretty neck of yours will"
find itself in a hempen collar. Now if it was only a case for judicious
"Hark, how the bells ring on the hillside!"
"Romantic? Yes. Mere sentimentality, mood, rhyme--nothing? Yes."
It is the last happiness.

The sun has returned. Not darkly glowing and regal--more than that:
"imperial, because it is flaming. This you do not understand, my friend,"
whatever the language in which it is dished up for you. But I say there is
an imperial sun in the sky.
"It's a good day for going to the woods; it is sweeping time, for the woods"
are full of yellow things that have come suddenly into being. A short time
"ago they were not there, or I did not see them, or they had the earth's"
"own complexion. There is something unborn about them, like embryos in an"
"early stage. But if I whirl them about, they are miracles of fulfillment."
"Here are fungi of every sort, mushrooms and puffballs. How close is the"
"poisonous mushroom to the happy family of the edible mushroom, and how"
innocently it stands there! Yet it is deadly. What magnificent cunning! A
"spurious fruit, a criminal, habitual vice itself, but preening in splendor"
"and brilliance, a very cardinal of fungi. I break off a morsel to chew; it"
"is good and soft on the tongue, but I am a coward and spit it out again."
Was it not the poisonous mushroom that drove men berserker? But in the
"dawn of our own day, we die of a hair in the throat."
In the white track was a brilliant silver object travelling along at a
"great speed. A number of anti-aircraft guns opened fire simultaneously,"
"and all around the shining fugitive innumerable stars of pale, liquid"
gold flashed out and melted away again.
"""I bet they're puttin' 'is bloody wind up! Rotten bastard, bombin' a lot"
"o' wounded! If I get 'old of a Fritz up the line, I'll murder 'im. Yer"
"won't catch me takin' no more pris'ners, I tell yer."""
A flashing star suddenly seemed to envelop the aeroplane.
"""Got 'im that time--bloody good shot--'e's comin' down, look, look, 'e's"
"comin' down! Look, 'e's all in flames!"""
"But the aeroplane sped on, growing smaller and smaller. Then the white"
"beam swung back and was extinguished, while the guns ceased firing."
"""Fine lot o' gunners we got--couldn't 'it a Zep 'alf a yard orf! They"
"ain't worth the grub they get!"""
We returned to our marquee and sat down on our kits. My friend Private
"Black came in after us, smiling ruefully. I asked him what was the"
matter.
"""I was playing the piano in the Sergeants' Mess when the first one"
dropped. We all jumped up together and rushed out. Then the second one
burst and I lost my head and didn't know where I was going. I darted to
"and fro, tripping over tent-ropes and dashing up against revetments. I"
"never had the wind up so much in all my life. I couldn't get my breath,"
there was a kind of weight on my stomach and a tightness round my chest
"and throat, and my knees kept on giving way all the time. The third one"
burst and I fell down and crawled under some ropes and lay flat against
"""Oh, I don't know,"" Sidney laughed. ""I'm all mixed up. I guess I was"
"trying to say something Mr. Dugald said once to me."""
"""Oh, _Dug_!"" laughed Pola. ""He's nutty about all that! Look at the way"
he lives here on the Cape. But mother says he'll get over it when he
marries. Now I have no intention of getting serious this grand day so
"let's have another piece of that chocolate fudge cake--it's on me, too,"
"remember!"" Which was Pola's pretty way of pretending she did not know"
that Sidney did not have any money with her. The dollar Sidney had
earned for posing had long since been spent.
"Sidney was relieved that Pola had rescued her from the ""deep water."" At"
the same time she suffered from the sense that she had not made Pola
see Mart in another light. She had failed in loyalty. The sparkling
blue of the bay that stretched before them only reminded her that this
"was the hour she usually went swimming. Due to Pola's ""complex"" she had"
not gone swimming for a whole week.
"Even with her mouth full of the fudge cake, she vowed to herself that"
the very next day she would hunt out her chums and her old pastimes.
Pola and Mr. Dugald must plan without her!
She had promised to dine again at the hotel with Pola and her mother
but as soon as she could after dinner she returned to Sunset Lane.
Because of her determination her heart was lighter. And her way was
"made easier, too, for Mrs. Allan had told Pola at dinner that the"
"""Truxtons were at Chatham Bars."" Pola had been as excited over the"
Truxtons as her mother.
"""Can we go and see them right away?"""
"""Not tonight. But I have arranged for a car and Shields will drive us"
dismay. For some reason she could not understand she had offended Mart.
And Pola had snubbed her. It had indeed been a cruel fate that had
brought Pola out on the wharf at that precise moment!
"She spent a lonely afternoon in Top Notch, too miserable to even pour"
"out her heart to ""Dorothea."" Then she helped Aunt Achsa prepare supper"
"and after supper, which was lonely, too, for neither Lavender nor Mr."
"Dugald were there, she insisted upon clearing up the dishes while Aunt"
Achsa went down to Tillie Higgins'.
Swishing her hands in the soapy water Sidney pondered sadly the things
she had longed to learn of Pola. Her name--why she hadn't even found
out her name! What had her teacher said of that theme she had written
on her visit to the Romley house? Where did Pola live? Of course she
might see her again--Pola had said that they'd be in Provincetown for a
"few days, but she did not _want_ to see her; she did not want Pola to"
see Sunset Lane and the little gray cottage and Aunt Achsa and
Lavender. Pola would laugh at them and she would hate her!
At that moment footsteps crunched the gravel of the path and a shadow
fell across the kitchen door. Sidney turned from the table. There stood
Mr. Dugald and with him--Pola.
"""I've brought my cousin, Sidney. She blew out to the Cape with that"
ill-wind we felt this morning. If you know what we can do with her I'll
"be your slave for life."""
Playfully pushing Dugald Allan aside Pola walked into the kitchen.
"""Isn't he horrid? You wouldn't dream that he's really crazy about me,"
"would you? I told him how we'd met, even before this morning. He'd"
written home that Miss Green's cousin was here but I never dreamed it
*       *       *       *       *
"Then I passed Deck Twelve and there was a big sign. ""Notice! Passengers"
"not permitted past this point!"" A big sign in red."
I peeked around the corner. I knew it--the next deck was the hull. I
"could see the portholes. Every twelve feet, they were, filled with the"
velvet of space and the dancing of more stars than I'd ever dreamed
existed in the Universe.
"There wasn't anyone on the deck, as far as I could see. And this"
"distance from the grav helix, the ship seemed mighty quiet and lonely."
If I just took one quick look....
But I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.
"Then I saw the big red sign again. ""Passengers not permitted--"""
Well! Didn't I know from my civics class that only women could be Earth
"Citizens these days? Sure, ever since the Male Desuffrage Act. And"
didn't I know that you had to be a citizen of a planet in order to
get an interplanetary passport? Sis had explained it all to me in the
"careful, patient way she always talks politics and things like that to"
men.
"""Technically, Ferdinand, I'm the only passenger in our family. You"
"can't be one, because, not being a citizen, you can't acquire an Earth"
"Passport. However, you'll be going to Venus on the strength of this"
"clause--'Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family,"
this number not to exceed the registered quota of sub-regulations
"pertaining'--and so on. I want you to understand these matters, so that"
you will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs.
"No matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men."""
"pitiful to hear. And the castle was hung with black, and in the whole"
kingdom proclamation was made from all pulpits that whoever could help
"the king's daughter should get her, and half the kingdom besides. Then"
"Tom, Dick and Harry, and the best physicians in the country came along."
But none of them could help the princess.
But one day a foreign doctor from afar came to court. He was not from
"their country, he said, and had made the journey purposely just to try"
"his luck here. But he must see the king's daughter alone, said he, and"
permission was granted him.
"The king's daughter recognized him, and grew red and pale in turn. ""If"
"I help you now, will you marry me?"" asked the youth. Yes, indeed she"
"would. Then he gave her one of the magic apples, and her horns were only"
"half as large as before. ""But I cannot do more until I have my cap,"
"and my table-cloth, and my purse back again,"" said he. So she went and"
"brought him the things. Then he gave her still another magic apple, and"
"now the horns were no more than tiny hornlets. ""But now I cannot go on"
"until you have sworn that you will be true to me,"" said he. And she"
"swore that she would. And after she had eaten the third apple, her"
"forehead was quite smooth again, and she was even more beautiful than"
in days gone by.
Then there was great joy in the castle. They prepared for the wedding
"with baking and brewing, and invited people from East and West to come"
"to it. And they ate and drank, and were merry and of good cheer, and if"
"they have not stopped, they are merry and of good cheer to this very"
day!
NOTE
"""No, you have a problem."" She examined him confidently. ""Because if"
"those materials are not returned to us, we will be forced to take"
"actions you may find harsh."""
"""Give it your best shot,"" he went on, glancing at Eva and hoping they"
"could keep up the bravado, ""because we've got a few cards in our hand"
too. Forget the money--that's history now--but we could still be in a
"position to blow your whole project sky high."""
"""You two are the only ones outside our organization who know about the"
"protocol. That knowledge will not be allowed to go any farther."""
"""Don't be so sure. For all you know, we've already stashed a copy"
"somewhere. Left word that if anything happens to either one of us, the"
package gets sent to the papers. Made public. Think what some premature
"headlines would do for your little project."""
"""We have thought about it, Mr. Vance. That contingency has been"
"covered."""
"""Well, if I don't know what the other player's got, I tend to trust my"
"own cards."""
But why play at all? he suddenly found himself musing. Fold this hand
and go for the next move.
"Before leaving Crete he'd transmitted a copy of the protocol, still in"
"its encrypted form, to his office computer in Nassau. At the time it'd"
merely seemed like prudence; now it might turn out to be a lifeline.
One phone call and it could be transmitted back here this very
afternoon. The magic of satellites in space. Knock out another quick
"world. He and I were raised here in New York, just like two brothers,"
together. I was eighteen and Jimmy was twenty. The next morning I was
to start for the West to make my fortune. You couldn’t have dragged
"Jimmy out of New York; he thought it was the only place on earth. Well,"
we agreed that night that we would meet here again exactly twenty years
"from that date and time, no matter what our conditions might be or from"
what distance we might have to come. We figured that in twenty years
"each of us ought to have our destiny worked out and our fortunes made,"
whatever they were going to be.”
"“It sounds pretty interesting,” said the policeman. “Rather a long time"
"between meets, though, it seems to me. Haven’t you heard from your"
friend since you left?”
"“Well, yes, for a time we corresponded,” said the other. “But after a"
"year or two we lost track of each other. You see, the West is a pretty"
"big proposition, and I kept hustling around over it pretty lively. But"
"I know Jimmy will meet me here if he’s alive, for he always was the"
"truest, stanchest old chap in the world. He’ll never forget. I came a"
"thousand miles to stand in this door to-night, and it’s worth it if my"
old partner turns up.”
"The waiting man pulled out a handsome watch, the lids of it set with"
small diamonds.
"“Three minutes to ten,” he announced. “It was exactly ten o’clock when"
we parted here at the restaurant door.”
"“Did pretty well out West, didn’t you?” asked the policeman."
"“You bet! I hope Jimmy has done half as well. He was a kind of plodder,"
"though, good fellow as he was. I’ve had to compete with some of the"
"distance glimmered the sea, and by a rock upon the hillside, armed"
"men, a knot of spears, shone like spirit sentinels athwart the west."
"Mists were creeping up the valleys, as the sun went down into the sea."
A few sparse stars gleamed out like souls still tortured by the
mysteries of life. An inevitable pessimism seemed to challenge the
"universe, taking for its parable the weird afterglow of the west."
Deep in the woods a voice sang wild and solitary in the gathering
"gloom. Like the cry of a ghost, it seemed to set the silence"
"quivering, the leaves quaking with windless awe. The men who looked"
"towards the sea heard it, a song that echoed in the heart like woe."
The duke pointed into the darkening wood.
"""Trust your own heart: self is the man! Through a mistaken sense of"
duty have you been brought nigh unto death and despair! Trust not in
"sophistry: the laws of men are carven upon stone, the laws of Heaven"
"upon the heart! Be strong! From henceforth, scorn mere words! Trample"
"tradition in the dust! Trust yourself, and the God in your heart!"""
The distant voice had sunk into silence. Francesco listened for it
with hands aloft.
"""I must go,"" he said."
"""Go!""--"
"""I must be near her through the night!"""
"""The moon stands full upon the hills! I will await you here!"""
"Dim were the woods that autumn evening, dim and deep with an ecstasy"
But when in her mirror she saw him standing behind her--he had crept into
the bedroom like a cat--fierceness came into her.  She could see the
"blood rush up in her own white face, and, turning round she said:"
"""No, Gustav, go out to the music-room if you want a companion."""
"He recoiled against the foot of the bed and stared at her haggardly, and"
"Gyp, turning back to her mirror, went on quietly taking the pins out of"
"her hair.  For fully a minute she could see him leaning there, moving his"
"head and hands as though in pain. Then, to her surprise, he went.  And a"
vague feeling of compunction mingled with her sense of deliverance.  She
"lay awake a long time, watching the fire-glow brighten and darken on the"
"ceiling, tunes from ""The Tales of Hoffmann"" running in her head; thoughts"
"and fancies crisscrossing in her excited brain.  Falling asleep at last,"
"she dreamed she was feeding doves out of her hand, and one of them was"
"Daphne Wing.  She woke with a start.  The fire still burned, and by its"
"light she saw him crouching at the foot of the bed, just as he had on"
"their wedding-night--the same hungry yearning in his face, and an arm"
"outstretched.  Before she could speak, he began:"
"""Oh, Gyp, you don't understand!  All that is nothing--it is only you I"
want--always.  I am a fool who cannot control himself. Think!  It's a
"long time since you went away from me."""
"Gyp said, in a hard voice:"
"""I didn't want to have a child."""
He said quickly:
"""No; but now you have it you are glad.  Don't be unmerciful, my Gyp!  It"
is like you to be merciful.  That girl--it is all over--I swear--I
house and garden. Surely you could be happy in—in—appreciating it for a
change. Or you could take up some hobby.”
"And Lola the baby had chimed in loftily, “All men ought to have"
hobbies. It makes life impossible if they haven’t.”
"Well, well! He couldn’t help a grim smile as painfully he began to"
climb the hill that led into Harcourt Avenue. Where would Lola and her
"sisters and Charlotte be if he’d gone in for hobbies, he’d like to"
"know? Hobbies couldn’t pay for the town house and the seaside bungalow,"
"and their horses, and their golf, and the sixty-guinea gramophone in"
the music-room for them to dance to. Not that he grudged them these
"things. No, they were smart, good-looking girls, and Charlotte was a"
remarkable woman; it was natural for them to be in the swim. As a
"matter of fact, no other house in the town was as popular as theirs; no"
"other family entertained so much. And how many times old Mr. Neave,"
"pushing the cigar box across the smoking-room table, had listened to"
"praises of his wife, his girls, of himself even."
"“You’re an ideal family, sir, an ideal family. It’s like something one"
reads about or sees on the stage.”
"“That’s all right, my boy,” old Mr. Neave would reply. “Try one of"
those; I think you’ll like them. And if you care to smoke in the
"garden, you’ll find the girls on the lawn, I dare say.”"
"That was why the girls had never married, so people said. They could"
have married anybody. But they had too good a time at home. They were
"too happy together, the girls and Charlotte. H’m, h’m! Well, well."
Perhaps so....
By this time he had walked the length of fashionable Harcourt Avenue;
get the Marines to teach you--he asked no questions. With one word he
"called the guard to attention, and himself saluted me--me a private! I"
handed him my rifle--there was an inch of blood at the point of the
"bayonet--and hobbled off to the nearest ladder. My word, I could"
"scarcely walk, and as for climbing a ship's ladder--I could never have"
done if some one hadn't given me a boost behind and some one else a
hand at the top. The Commander and the Major of Marines were both in
"the wardroom; I walked in, saluted them as a self-respecting private"
"should do, and told them the whole story."""
"""It was Petty Officer Trehayne,"" said I calmly--and waited for a"
sensation.
"""Of course,"" replied Dawson, greatly to my annoyance. He might have"
"shown some astonishment at my wonderful intuition; but he didn't, not"
"a scrap. Even Cary was at first disappointing, though he warmed up"
"later, and did me full justice. ""Trehayne a spy!"" cried Cary. ""He"
"looked a smart good man."""
"""I am not saying that he wasn't,"" snapped Dawson, whose nerves were"
"very badly on edge. ""He was obeying the orders of his superiors as we"
"all have to do. He gave his life, and it was for his country's"
service. Nobody can do more than that. Don't you go for to slander
"Trehayne. I watched him die--on his feet."""
"Cary turned to me. ""What made you think it was Trehayne?"" he asked."
"This was better. I looked at Dawson, who was brooding in his chair"
with his thoughts far away. He was still seeing those eyes fading out
under the glare of the electrics between the steel decks of the
_Malplaquet_!
"""It was a sheer guess at first,"" said I, preserving a decent show of"
must have an army in here. Ned was coaxed away by a fake note; Jimmie
"went to find Ned and got lost himself, and we go out to answer a call"
for help and get mixed up with a lot of half-breeds. I guess we’ll have
to take a company of state troops with us next time we go camping.”
"“Well, let’s be moving,” urged Frank. “Those fellows’ heads will be just"
sore enough when they quit rolling to shoot at anything in sight. They’d
string us up if they caught us now.”
"In accordance with this reasoning, the boys turned south in the thicket"
"then shifted to the east, then whirled back in a northerly direction. At"
one time they heard the shouts of the half-breeds on the slope far away
to the south.
"“They think we kept right on south,” laughed Jack. “Now,” he went on,"
"“we’ll walk north a long ways, climb the slope to the snow line, and"
come out on the camp from above. How’s that strike you boys?”
"“It listens good to me,” Frank answered. “Do you suppose Ned is back"
there yet?” he continued.
"“It struck me,” Jack replied, “that the half-breeds we encountered were"
out looking for Ned or Jimmie.”
"“You’ll have to guess again,” Harry put in. “The ginks we encountered"
were stationed there to catch any Boy Scout who came in answer to that
signal. That’s some more of the work of that crooked messenger.”
"“Well, I hope the bears won’t devour Gilroy while we’re gone,” Frank"
suggested. “It’s likely to be night before we get back.”
"The boys walked for a long distance, and it was three o’clock by their"
"""Now, Miss Sparling, no hoopla. I'm saying let's get married, and you"
know it. You figured out from what the boy told you that I was chewing

"know how to operate sub-surface machinery, you've lived underwater, and"
your disposition's no worse than most of the anura I've seen. Prolific

land when they're cleared. Not to mention the rich berzeliot beds
offshore. I got no bad habits outside of having my own way. I'm also
"passable good-looking for a slaptoe planter. Besides, if you marry"
me you'll be the first mated on this ship--and that's a splash most
"nesting females like to make."""
There was a longish stretch of quiet. Sis stepped back and measured him
slowly with her eyes; there was a lot to look at. He waited patiently
while she covered the distance from his peculiar green boots to that
head of hair. I was so excited I was gulping instead of breathing.
Imagine having Butt for a brother-in-law and living on a wet-plantation
in Flatfolk country!
But then I remembered Sis's level head and I didn't have much hope any
and talking together. They were greatly agitated.
The old woman sniffed and wiped her eyes. The elder daughter was
"packing a few things in a bundle. One of the officers asked: ""What about"
"our coffee?"" but she took no notice. Her sister had gone out in search"
of further information.
"She soon returned. Yes, they would all have to leave at once, but, if"
"they liked to take the risk, they could come back to-morrow with a"
"wagon, if they could get one, and fetch their belongings."
They were comforted. They knew where they would be able to get a wagon.
They would cart their stock and their household property away on the
morrow. They would start another estaminet somewhere. They would suffer
"loss and inconvenience, but they would not be ruined--their valuable"
stock of wines would save them from that.
The bundle was made up and they prepared to leave. We paid our bill and
went out into the street. Numbers of soldiers were straggling past. They
looked wretched and exhausted. Their boots and puttees were caked with
mud. They had neither rifles nor packs. Three men were lying up against
"a garden wall. We asked them for news. They could not tell us much,"
except that the Germans were still advancing.
"""We was at Dickebusch when 'e started slingin' stuff over--gorblimy, 'e"
don't 'alf wallop yer--umpteen of our mates got bleed'n' well biffed. We
"cleared out afore it got too 'ot."""
"Several famished ""battle-stragglers"" had entered our camp in order to"
beg for food. They sat round the cook-house and ate in gloomy silence.
In the adjoining field a number of tents had sprung up. Blue figures
"Of course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumb"
"things. I'm old enough, I guess, to know that it isn't what _Women_"
like and appreciate that counts when it comes to people getting
"married. If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like her"
wouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.
"Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do"
"with me. I knew what Sis could say to _that_, but at least it was an"
argument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law.
"I was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off to"
"the left, about five times as big as I'd ever seen it, except in the"
"movies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holding"
"off the black of space. I was hoping to see the Earth, but I figured it"
must be on the other side of the ship or behind us. I pressed my nose
"against the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off,"
Marsbound. I wished I was on that one!
"Then I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch of"
blank wall where there should have been portholes. High up on the
"wall in glowing red letters were the words, ""Lifeboat 47. Passengers:"
"Thirty-two. Crew: Eleven. Unauthorized personnel keep away!"""
Another one of those signs.
*       *       *       *       *
I crept up to the porthole nearest it and could just barely make out
the stern jets where it was plastered against the hull. Then I walked
under the sign and tried to figure the way you were supposed to get
into it. There was a very thin line going around in a big circle that I
"wood-louse!  You nose out every evil thing.  Yes, the face of that"
young swindler shows that he has got what he wanted...  I wonder how
much Egorka has got out of them.  He has evidently taken something...
He is just the same sort of rogue that they are ... they are all tarred
"with the same brush.  He has got some money, and I'm damned if I did"
not arrange the whole thing for him!  It is best to own my folly...
"Yes, life is against us all, brothers ... and even when you spit upon"
"those nearest to you, the spittle rebounds and hits your own face."""
"Having satisfied himself with this reflection, the worthy Captain"
"looked round upon his staff.  Every one of them was disappointed,"
because they all knew that something they did not expect had taken
"place between Petunikoff and Vaviloff, and they all felt that they had"
been insulted.  The feeling that one is unable to injure anyone is
"worse than the feeling that one is unable to do good, because to do"
harm is far easier and simpler.
"""Well, why are we loitering here?  We have nothing more to wait for ..."
"except the reward that I shall get out--out of Egorka,..."" said the"
"Captain, looking angrily at the eating-house. ""So our peaceful life"
under the roof of Judas has come to an end. Judas will now turn us
"out....  So do not say that I have not warned you."""
Kanets smiled sadly.
"""What are you laughing at, jailer?"" Kuvalda asked."
"""Where shall I go then?"""
"""That, my soul, is a question that fate will settle for you, so do not"
"worry,"" said the Captain, thoughtfully, entering the dosshouse.  ""The"
"creatures that once were men"" followed him."
Now Aunt Achsa hesitated. One tear separated itself from its fellows
and rolled down her withered cheek and dropped upon her withered hand.
"She looked at it, startled, then lifted her hand and dashed it across"
her eyes.
"""I swum, I'm cryin'. Don't know as I know when I've cried before. And"
"cryin' before I have anything as I can see to cry for. But Sidney, I"
set such a lot on that boy--it's like I was his mother and his father
"and his brothers and his sisters all mixed up in one--gran'ma, too. He"
"was such a little mite when I took him, y'see and then he's not like"
other boys and I've had to do a heap of lovin' to make up to him. I've
prayed every day of my life for the Lord to keep him happy in spite of
things and that was a pretty big prayer for I don't suppose the Lord
"wants us all to be happy all the time, that ain't His way of bringing"
"us up. But I thought He might make an exception for Lav. Land sakes,"
"how I go on--and you nigh to cryin' yourself."" For she had caught"
Sidney blinking back something glistening from her own eyes.
"""Aunt Achsa, Lavender is wonderful. He's talked to me a lot and he's"
"going to be a great man some day, I know. He has the grandest plans"
"shut away in his heart and he _is_ happy--"""
"Aunt Achsa looked at her, startled. ""Plans--how _can_ he when he's--"""
She bit off the words. Her lips trembled.
"""Aunt Achsa, it doesn't matter what one's like on the outside!"" Now"
Sidney floundered for the second time in one day under the pressure of
"her own thoughts. ""I mean--Lav can do anything he wants to do, anyway."
"And he's working hard reading and studying and some day, after awhile,"
"he'll go away somewhere and study more--"""
cheek glared at the duke from under his upreared arm. So close were
they that blood spattered in the duke's face as the Frangipani blew
the red stream from his mouth and beard.
"[Illustration: ""'They lied,' he cried. 'Give me but life.'""]"
"The duke broke away, wheeled and came again. He lashed home, split the"
Frangipani's collar-bone even through the rags of his hauberk. The
"Frangipani yelped like a gored hound. Rabid, dazed, he began to make"
blind rushes that boded ill for him. The swords began to leap and to
"sing, while blinding flashes of lightning followed each other in quick"
succession and thunder rolled in deafening echoes through the heavens.
"Cut and counter-cut rang through the night, like the cry of axes,"
whirled by woodmen's hands.
Suddenly the Frangipani parried an upper cut and stabbed at the duke.
The sword point missed him a hair's breadth. Before he could guard the
"duke was upon him like a leopard. Both men smote together, both swords"
met with a sound that seemed to shake the rocks. The Frangipani's
blade snapped at the hilt.
"He stood still for a moment as one dazed, then plucked out his poniard"
"and made a spring. A merciless down cut beat him back. His courage,"
"his assurance seemed to ebb from him on a sudden, as though the blow"
"had broken his soul. He fell on his knees and held up his hands, with"
"a thick, choking cry."
"""Mercy! God's mercy!"""
"""Curse you! Had you pity on your victims?"""
Thunder crashed overhead; the girdles of the sky were loosed. A
"rowing. A little later I got up and looked again--oh, yes, they were"
getting on. I took up my post by the window. It was really quite
interesting to watch the boat getting smaller and smaller; finally I
"opened the window, even looked through my field-glasses. As it was not yet"
"quite light, I could not see them very clearly, but the red hat was still"
discernible. Then the boat disappeared behind an island. I dressed and
"went down. The children were all still in bed, but the wife, Regine, was"
up. How calmly and naturally she took everything!
"""Do you know where your husband is?"" I asked her."
"""Yes--funny, aren't they?"" she replied. ""I never saw them till after"
they'd left--gone down to the fjord. Where do you suppose they're going?
"Haddock fishing?"""
"""Maybe,"" was all I said. But I thought to myself: ""They're leaving, all"
"right. They had their knapsacks on their backs."""
"""Funny couple,"" Regine resumed. ""Nothing to eat, no coffee, not a thing!"
"And the missis not wanting anything to eat last night, neither!"""
I merely shook my head and went out. Regine called to me that coffee was
"nearly ready, so if I'd like a cup--"
Of course the only thing I could do in the face of such foolishness was to
shake my head and go away. One must take the sensible view. How was it
"possible to understand such behavior? Nevertheless I, the undersigned,"
"should have gone on to Olaus yesterday, instead of going fishing. That"
would have been still more sensible. What business had I at this house?
"Very likely she found it embarrassing to be called the ""missis,"" and this"
was why she could neither eat last night nor stay here today. So she had
"beaten a retreat, with her friend and her knapsack."
"""You cannot?  Why?""  I demanded, taken somewhat aback by her sudden"
attitude of determination.
"""I will not allow you to ruin yourself, Gerald, on my account,"" she"
declared in a very low but calm voice.
"""But why should my love for you prove my ruin?""  I cried madly.  ""The"
"truth is that you do not love me.  Why not admit it at once?"""
"""You are in error,"" she hastened to protest.  ""I do love you.  I love"
you to-day with the same fond affection as I entertained for you until
that day--fatal to me--when you turned your back upon me and left me.
"But, alas! we can never now be the same to one another as we were then."""
"She paused for a moment to regain breath; then, pale-faced, with eyes"
"filled with tears, she gripped my arm frantically, crying: ""Gerald, my"
"love, hear me!  These are my last words, but I pronounce them--I make"
confession--so that you may understand the barrier that now lies between
"us."""
"""Well,"" I said, ""speak--tell me!"""
"""Ah!"" she cried hoarsely, covering her face with her hands, ""you wring"
this confession from me.  I am the most unhappy girl in all the world.
"Would that I were dead that it was all ended!  If I did not love you,"
"Gerald, I should deceive you, and leave you to discover the truth after"
our marriage.  But I cannot--I cannot!  Even though we shall part to-day
"for ever, I have resolved to be frank with you because I still have one"
"single spark of honesty left within my heart!"""
"""I don't understand,"" I exclaimed.  ""Tell me."""
"""Then listen,"" she said in a hard, unnatural voice, after a few moments"
"the control swivel-chair at the nose of the lifeboat. ""But way I look"
"at it, a man who lets somebody else handle his blaster is like the"
giant whose heart was in an egg that an enemy found. When you've grown
"enough so's your pop feels you ought to have a weapon, why, then's the"
"time to learn it and you might's well learn fast. Before then, you're"
"plain too young to be even near it."""
"""I don't have a father to give me one when I come of age. I don't even"
have an older brother as head of my family like your brother Labrador.
"All I have is Sis. And _she_--"""
"""She'll marry some fancy dryhorn who's never been farther South than"
"the Polar Coast. And she'll stay head of the family, if I know her"
"breed of green shata. _Bossy, opinionated._ By the way, Fordie,"" he"
"said, rising and stretching so the fish-leather bounced and rippled off"
"his biceps, ""that sister. She ever...."""
"And he'd be off again, cross-examining me about Evelyn. I sat in the"
swivel chair he'd vacated and tried to answer his questions. But there
"was a lot of stuff I didn't know. Evelyn was a healthy girl, for"
"instance; how healthy, exactly, I had no way of finding out. Yes, I'd"
"tell him, my aunts on both sides of my family each had had more than"
"the average number of children. No, we'd never done any farming to"
"speak of, back in Undersea, but--yes, I'd guess Evelyn knew about as"
much as any girl there when it came to diving equipment and pressure
pump regulation.
How would I know that stuff would lead to trouble for me?

Sis had insisted I come along to the geography lecture. Most of the
"""That is simple,"" comments Captain Kuvalda.  ""It continues to serve."
"That is ridiculous.  To the merchant who is moving about in the city,"
it is profitable that it should continue to serve. Therefore it does
"continue."""
"""The article, in fact, is written on the subject,"" says the teacher."
"""Is it?  That is strange, it is more a subject for a feuilleton..."""
"""Such a subject must be treated with plenty of pepper...."""
"Then a short discussion begins.  The people listen attentively, as only"
one bottle of vodki has been drunk.
"After the leader, they read the local events, then the court"
"proceedings, and, if in the police court it reports that the defendant"
"or plaintiff is a merchant, then Aristid Kuvalda sincerely rejoices."
"If someone has robbed the merchant, ""That is good,"" says he.  ""Only it"
"is a pity they robbed him of so little.""  If his horses have broken"
"down, ""It is sad that he is still alive.""  If the merchant has lost his"
"suit in court, ""It is a pity that the costs were not double the amount."""
"""That would have been illegal,"" remarks the teacher"
"""Illegal!  But is the merchant himself legal?"" inquires Kuvalda,"
"bitterly.  ""What is the merchant?  Let us investigate this rough and"
"uncouth phenomenon.  First of all, every merchant is a mujik. He comes"
"from a village, and in course of time becomes a merchant.  In order to"
"be a merchant, one must have money.  Where can the mujik get the money"
"from?  It is well known that he does not get it by honest hard work,"
"and that means that the mujik, somehow or other, has been swindling."
"That is to say, a merchant is simply a dishonest mujik."""
"Yashka was ""touched with paint"" after two glasses of vodki, and was in"
a slightly uplifted condition.
"The people looked at him, expecting him to make a row, and all were"
silent.
"""Did you see me?  And how did it please you?"" asks Yashka."
The people control their laughter.
"""No; it did not please me,"" replies the teacher.  His tone is so"
serious that the people are silent.
"""You see I was just trying it,"" said Yashka, with bravado, fearing that"
"the teacher would rebuke him. ""The wife is satisfied....  She has not"
"got up yet to-day...."""
"The teacher, who was drawing absently with his fingers on the table,"
"said, ""Do you see, Yakov, why this did not please me? ... Let us go"
"into the matter thoroughly, and understand what you are really doing,"
and what the result may be.  Your wife is pregnant.  You struck her
last night on her sides and breast. That means that you beat not only
"her but the child too.  You may have killed him, and your wife might"
have died or else have become seriously ill.  To have the trouble of
"looking after a sick woman is not pleasant.  It is wearing, and would"
"cost you dear, because illness requires medicine, and medicine money."
"If you have not killed the child, you may have crippled him, and he"
"will be born deformed, lop-sided, or hunch-backed.  That means that he"
"will not be able to work, and it is only too important to you that he"
"should be a good workman.  Even if he be born ill, it will be bad"
"enough, because he will keep his mother from work, and will require"
medicine.  Do you see what you are doing to yourself?  Men who live by
"plate. She fears--"""
"_Von G._: ""I understand! We have a dr-r-eadful reputation, we poor"
Germans! The French stuff you up with lies. But we are better than
you think. You shall take them in two--three days to Brussels when
"things are quiet, and put them in some bank. Here I fear I must"
stay. I must intrude myself on your hospitality. But better for you
perhaps if I stay here at present. I will put a few of my men in
your--your--buildings. Most of them shall go with their officers to
"Tervueren for billet."" (Turning to Mrs. Warren.) ""Madam, you must"
cheer up. I foresee your daughter and I will be great friends. Let
us now look through the rooms and see what disposition we can make.
"I think I will have to take this room for my writing, for my work. I"
"see you have telephone here. _Gut_!"""
"Leaving Mrs. Warren still seated, but a little less stertorous in"
"breathing, a little reassured, Vivie and Oberst von Giesselin then"
"went over the Villa, apportioning the rooms. The Colonel and his"
orderly would be lodged in two of the bedrooms. Vivie and her mother
would share Mrs. Warren's large bedroom and retain the salon for
their exclusive occupation. They would use the dining-room in common
with their guest.
"Vivie looking out of the windows occasionally, as they passed from"
"room to room, saw the remainder of the soldiery strolling off to be"
"lodged at their nearest neighbour's, the farmer who had driven them"
"in to Brussels that morning. There were perhaps thirty, accompanying"
"a young lieutenant. How would he find room for them, poor man? They"
were more fortunate in being asked only to lodge six or seven in
"addition to the Colonel's orderly and soldier-clerk. Before sunset,"
"the Villa Beau-séjour was clear of soldiers, except the few that had"
gone to the barn and the outhouses. The morning room had been fitted
of the people settled down to a lively _conversazione_. It is much
"nicest, on the whole, to travel third class on the railway. There is"
"space, there is air, and it is like being in a lively inn, everybody in"
good spirits.
At our end was plenty of room. Just across the gangway was an elderly
"couple, like two children, coming home very happily. He was fat, fat all"
"over, with a white moustache and a little not-unamiable frown. She was a"
"tall lean, brown woman, in a brown full-skirted dress and black apron,"
"with huge pocket. She wore no head covering, and her iron grey hair was"
parted smoothly. They were rather pleased and excited being in the
"train. She took all her money out of her big pocket, and counted it and"
"gave it to him: all the ten Lira notes, and the five Lira and the two"
"and the one, peering at the dirty scraps of pink-backed one-lira notes"
to see if they were good. Then she gave him her half-pennies. And he
"stowed them away in the trouser pocket, standing up to push them down"
"his fat leg. And then one saw, to one's amazement, that the whole of his"
"shirt-tail was left out behind, like a sort of apron worn backwards."
"Why--a mystery. He was one of those fat, good-natured, unheeding men"
"with a little masterful frown, such as usually have tall, lean,"
"hard-faced, obedient wives."
They were very happy. With amazement he watched us taking hot tea from
the Thermos flask. I think he too had suspected it might be a bomb. He
had blue eyes and standing-up white eyebrows.
"""Beautiful hot--!"" he said, seeing the tea steam. It is the inevitable"
"exclamation. ""Does it do you good?"""
"""Yes,"" said the q-b. ""Much good."" And they both nodded complacently."
They were going home.
"The sun is already setting. Far up the mountainside are the cattle, but"
they are moving homeward now; I can hear by their bells that they are
"moving. Tinkling bells and deep-mouthed bells, sometimes sounding together"
"as though there were a meaning in it, a pattern of tones, a rapture."
"And rapture, too, to see all the blades of grass and the tiny flowers and"
"plants. Beside me where I lie is a small pod plant, wonderfully meek, with"
"tiny seeds pushing out of the pod--God bless it, it's becoming a mother!"
It has got caught in a dry twig and I liberate it. Life quivers within it;
"the sun has warmed it today and called it to its destiny. A tiny, gigantic"
miracle.
"Now it is sunset, and the woods bend under a rustling that passes"
through them sweet and heavy; it is the evening.
"I lie for another hour or two; the birds have long since gone to rest, and"
"darkness falls thick and soft.... As I walk homeward, my feet feel their"
"way and I hold my hands before me till I reach the field, where it is a"
little lighter. I walk on the hay that has been left outdoors; it is tough
"and black, and I slip on it because it is already rotting. As I approach"
"the houses, bats fly noiselessly past me, as though on wings of foam. A"
slight shudder convulses me whenever they pass.
Suddenly I stop.
A man is walking here. I can see him against the wall of the new house. He
"has on a coat that looks like the actor's raincoat, but it is not the"
"little comedian himself. There he goes, into the house, right into the"
house. It is Solem.
"""Why, that's where she sleeps!"" I think. ""Ah, well. Alone in the building,"
"in the south wing, Miss Torsen alone--yes, quite alone. And Solem has just"
I answered in a low tone that I thought she must.
'No!' my lady cried harshly--she could be cruel sometimes--'not with
"us. She does not belong to our party. Let her stay with her paymaster,"
and to-morrow he will doubtless reward her.'
What reward she was likely to get Fraulein Max knew well. She flung
"herself at my lady's feet in an agony of fear, and clutching her"
"skirts, cried abjectly for mercy; she would carry, she would help, she"
"would do anything, if she might go! Knowing that we dared not leave"
her since she would be certain to release the general as soon as our
"backs were turned, I was glad when Marie, whose heart was touched,"
joined her prayers to the culprit's and won a reluctant consent.
It has taken long to tell these things. They passed very quickly. I
suppose not more than a quarter of an hour elapsed between our first
"appearance and this juncture, which saw us all standing in the"
"lamplight, laden and ready to be gone; while the general glowered at"
"us in sullen rage, and my lady, with a new thought in her mind, looked"
round in dismay.
"She drew me aside. 'Martin,' she said, 'his orderly is waiting in the"
road with his horse. The moment we are gone he will shout to him.'
"'We have provided for that,' I answered, nodding. Then assuring myself"
"by a last look round that all were ready, I gave the word. 'Now,"
Steve!' I said sharply.
In a twinkling he flung over the general's head a small sack doubled
inwards. We heard a stifled oath and a cry of rage. The bars of the
"strong chair creaked as our prisoner struggled, and for a moment it"
feel their knuckles against her.  Had he gone mad?  Would he strangle
"her?  But her eyes never moved from his, and his began to waver; his"
"hands dropped, and, with a kind of moan, he made for the door."
Monsieur Harmost's voice behind her said:
"""Before you go, monsieur, give me some explanation of this imbecility!"""
"Fiorsen spun round, shook his fist, and went out muttering.  They heard"
"the front door slam.  Gyp turned abruptly to the window, and there, in"
"her agitation, she noticed little outside things as one does in moments"
"of bewildered anger.  Even into that back yard, summer had crept.  The"
leaves of the sumach-tree were glistening; in a three-cornered little
"patch of sunlight, a black cat with a blue ribbon round its neck was"
basking.  The voice of one hawking strawberries drifted melancholy from a
side street.  She was conscious that Monsieur Harmost was standing very
"still, with a hand pressed to his mouth, and she felt a perfect passion"
of compunction and anger.  That kind and harmless old man--to be so
insulted!  This was indeed the culmination of all Gustav's outrages!  She
"would never forgive him this!  For he had insulted her as well, beyond"
"what pride or meekness could put up with.  She turned, and, running up to"
"the old man, put both her hands into his."
"""I'm so awfully sorry.  Good-bye, dear, dear Monsieur Harmost; I shall"
"come on Friday!""  And, before he could stop her, she was gone."
"She dived into the traffic; but, just as she reached the pavement on the"
"other side, felt her dress plucked and saw Fiorsen just behind her.  She"
shook herself free and walked swiftly on.  Was he going to make a scene
"in the street?  Again he caught her arm.  She stopped dead, faced round"
"on him, and said, in an icy voice:"
"faculty for absorbing butter. The stomachs of most men, really good at"
"their business, would have revolted at the diet which his superiors"
"shovelled into Dawson, but he visibly expanded and blossomed. Yes,"
"Scotland Yard knew its Dawson, and exactly how to stimulate the best"
that was in him. He never bored me; I enjoyed him too thoroughly.
One day in my club I chanced upon the Admiral.
"""Have you met our friend Dawson lately?"" I asked."
"""Met him?"" shouted he, with a roar of laughter. ""Met him? He is in my"
office every day--he almost lives with me; goodness knows when he does
his work. He has a pocket full of letters which he has read to me till
I know them by heart. If I did not know that he was a first-class man
"I should set him down as a colossal ass. Yet, I rather wish that the"
Admiralty would sometimes write to me as the severe but very human
"Scotland Yard does to Dawson."""
"""Does he ever come to you in disguise?"" I asked."
"""Not that I know of. I see vast numbers of people; some of them may be"
"Dawson in his various incarnations, but he has not given himself"
"away."""
"Then I explained to my naval friend my own experience. ""He tried,"" I"
"said, ""to play the disguise game on me, and clean bowled me the first"
time. While he was laughing over my discomfiture I studied his face
more closely than a lover does that of his mistress. I tried to
penetrate his methods. He never wears a wig or false hair; he is too
wise for that folly. Yet he seems able to change his hair from light
"to dark, to make it lank or curly, short or long. He does it; how I"
"don't know. He alters the shape of his nose, his cheeks, and his chin."
"And then, in great mental agony, I said to myself: ""I _will_ be happy, I"
"_will_ enjoy my leave."" But a number of invisible cobwebs hung between"
"myself and the world around me. I tried to brush them away, but they"
were so impalpable that the movement of my hand did not disturb them at
all.
I gave up the attempt. I would wait until I got home. Then I would talk
and forget myself--only by forgetting myself would I enjoy the present.
Only those who forget themselves are happy. The obsession of self is
the most oppressive of all burdens.
I descended from a 'bus and took a train. A girl sitting opposite me
"stared at my blue chevrons and whispered to her fellow passenger: ""He's"
"just come from the front."" So I too was regarded as a strange kind of"
animal. I got out at my home-station. I showed my leave-warrant to the
ticket collector. He was a benevolent looking old man. He smiled and
wished me good luck. Things began to seem a little less foreign. And
then the thought of being home in a few minutes absorbed me entirely.
"I hurried down the street. I knocked at the door, and it opened. The"
long yearned-for meeting took place at last.
"I threw my pack, equipment and steel helmet contemptuously into a"
"corner. I took an infantile delight in clean, furnished rooms, in the"
"white table-cloth, the shining silver, the cut flowers, and the"
oil-paintings on the wall. And we talked until late into the night.
It was good to wake up the next morning and to know that the first day
of my leave was still before me. I felt encouraged to face my new
surroundings boldly. I would understand them and identify myself with
"them. If the sensation that I was dreaming came upon me again, I would"
have stolen from you. I _am_ called Ramerrez; I _have_ robbed; I _am_ a
"road agent--an outlaw by profession. Yes, I'm all that--and my father"
"was that before me. I was brought up, educated, thrived on thieves'"
"money, I suppose, but until six months ago when my father died, I did"
not know it. I lived much in Monterey--I lived there as a gentleman.
When we met that day I wasn't the thing I am to-day. I only learned the
truth when my father died and left me with a rancho and a band of
"thieves--nothing else--nothing for us all, and I--but what's the good of"
going into it--the circumstances. You wouldn't understand if I did. I
"was my father's son; I have no excuse; I guess, perhaps, it was in"
"me--in the blood. Anyhow, I took to the road, and I didn't mind it much"
after the first time. But I drew the line at killing--I wouldn't have
"that. That's the man that I am, the blackguard that I am. But--"" here he"
"raised his eyes and said with a voice that was charged with feeling--""I"
swear to you that from the moment I kissed you to-night I meant to
"change, I meant to--"""
"""The devil you did!"" broke from the Girl's lips, but with a sound that"
was not unlike a sob.
"""I did, believe me, I did,"" insisted the man. ""I meant to go straight"
and take you with me--but only honestly--when I could honestly. I meant
"to work for you. Why, every word you said to me to-night about being a"
thief cut into me like a knife. Over and over again I have said to
"myself, she must never know. And now--well, it's all over--I have"
"finished."""
"""An' that's all?"" questioned the Girl with averted face."
"""No--yes--what's the use . . .?"""
The Girl's anger blazed forth again.
"_Antigone_ for damage to her forefoot. Engineers were on one job, and"
platers and riveters on the other. Different trades. So not a workman
who was in the _Antinous_ was also in the _Antigone_. We can rule out
all the workmen. We can also rule out my lieutenant R.N.R. with the
German name who has gone to sea in the _Antinous_. The care and
maintenance party in the _Antigone_ was not the same as the one in the
"_Antinous_, not a man the same."""
"""You are sure of that?"" cried I, for it seemed that my daring theory"
"had gone to wreck. ""You are quite sure."""
"""Quite. I have all the names and have examined all the men. They were"
all off the ship by eleven o'clock last night. I hadn't one of my own
"men among them, but, to make sure, I sent Petty Officer Trehayne on"
board at eight o'clock to keep a sharp look-out and to see all the
harbour party off the vessel. He reported a little after eleven that
they were all gone and the ship taken over by her own crew. The damage
"was discovered at four bells in the morning watch."""
"""Six o'clock a.m.,"" interpreted Cary."
"""It looks now as if there might be a traitor among her own crew, which"
"is her officers' job, not mine. I wash my hands of the _Antigone_, but"
it is very much up to me to see that nothing hurtful happens to the
_Malplaquet_. The Admiral has orders to support me with all the force
under his command; the General of the District has the same orders.
But it isn't force we want so much as brains--Dawson's brains. I have
"been beaten twice, but not the third time. I've told the Yard that if"
"the _Malplaquet_ is touched I shall resign, and if they send any one"
"to help me I shall resign. Between to-day, Thursday, and Saturday I am"
going to catch the wily josser who has a fancy for cutting gun cables
"or Dawson will say good-bye to the Force. That's a fair stake."""
"'Can you do anything,' I asked, 'to cheer him? Do you speak to him of"
"what may happen after death, of hopes of another life?'"
"'No one can tell,' said my friend, 'what will happen after death. It"
"depends on a man's life, if he has done good or evil, what his next"
"existence will be, whether he will go a step nearer to the Peace. When"
"the man is dying no monks will come, truly; but an old man, an old"
"friend, father, perhaps, or an elder of the village, and he will talk to"
"the dying man. He will say, ""Think of your good deeds; think of all that"
"you have done well in this life. Think of your good deeds.""'"
'What is the use of that?' I asked. 'Suppose you think of your good
"deeds, what then? Will that bring peace?'"
The Burman seemed to think that it would.
"'Nothing,' he said, 'was so calming to a man's soul as to think of even"
one deed he had done well in his life.'
"Think of the man dying. The little house built of bamboo and thatch,"
"with an outer veranda, where the friends are sitting, and the inner"
"room, behind a wall of bamboo matting, where the man is lying. A pot of"
"flowers is standing on a shelf on one side, and a few cloths are hung"
here and there beneath the brown rafters. The sun comes in through
"little chinks in roof and wall, making curious lights in the"
"semi-darkness of the room, and it is very hot."
"From outside come the noises of the village, cries of children playing,"
"grunts of cattle, voices of men and women clearly heard through the"
still clear air of the afternoon. There is a woman pounding rice near
"by with a steady thud, thud of the lever, and there is a clink of a loom"
from a German mercantile sub-marine. So he says. Fifty francs a
"metre--very, very wide. But they are too much trouble to carry in a"
"knapsack, though their brilliance fascinates."
*       *       *       *       *
"So we stroll and look at the shops, at the filigree gold jewelling of"
"the peasants, at a good bookshop. But there is little to see and"
"therefore the question is, shall we go on? Shall we go forward?"
There are two ways of leaving Cagliari for the north: the State railway
"that runs up the west side of the island, and the narrow-gauge secondary"
railway that pierces the centre. But we are too late for the big trains.
"So we will go by the secondary railway, wherever it goes."
"There is a train at 2.30, and we can get as far as Mandas, some fifty"
miles in the interior. When we tell the queer little waiter at the
"hotel, he says he comes from Mandas, and there are two inns. So after"
lunch--a strictly fish menu--we pay our bill. It comes to sixty odd
"francs--for three good meals each, with wine, and the night's lodging,"
"this is cheap, as prices now are in Italy."
"Pleased with the simple and friendly Scala di Ferre, I shoulder my sack"
and we walk off to the second station. The sun is shining hot this
"afternoon--burning hot, by the sea. The road and the buildings look dry"
"and desiccated, the harbour rather weary and end of the world."
There is a great crowd of peasants at the little station. And almost
every man has a pair of woven saddle-bags--a great flat strip of
"coarse-woven wool, with flat pockets at either end, stuffed with"
purchases. These are almost the only carrying bags. The men sling them
"over their shoulder, so that one great pocket hangs in front, one"
"""No, sir—far from it.  Let me hear you to the end.  I did see you take"
"forth a roll of paper from your breast as you came in.  That action,"
"together with your face, told me much.  You have the gift of a creative"
"fancy.  You have written a poem or a play."""
"""Neither the one nor the other, but a romance,"" answered Grey, the"
colour flushing his face as it flushes that of a maiden when the love of
"her heart is named by her.  ""I scarce know how to call it, but methinks"
it savours more of a romance than of aught besides.  When I was rudely
"awakened from my pleasure-loving life, saw the folly and futility"
"thereof, and desired to amend, I did take a quiet lodging high up in a"
"building off Holborn, and there I did set myself to the task, and right"
"happy was I in it.  I had a score of gold pieces still left me, and my"
"needs I did think modest; though, looking back, they seem many to me"
"now.  The weeks fled by, and my work reached its close.  When my romance"
"was finished, my money was all but spent.  For the past week or more I"
have been seeking a publisher for it.  In my folly I did think that it
would bring me gold as fast as I wanted.  My eyes have been rudely
"opened these last days."""
The Old Lion nodded his head many times.
"""You made a mistake in seeking a publisher, young sir.  You should first"
"have sought a patron."""
"Grey’s face flushed slightly, and he hesitated before he spoke."
"""Others have said the same to me; but there are difficulties.  I have"
not learned to go cap in hand to cringe for patronage to the great ones
"of the earth.""  But, as Grey saw a slight smile flicker in the old man’s"
"eyes, he added rather hastily, ""And then I desire not to be known and"
announced that the prisoner had been placed in cell No. 2. Dawson
"sprang up. ""We will have a look at him through the peephole, and if it"
"is our man--"" One glance was enough. Before me I saw him whom I had"
expected to see. He and his cargo of whisky bottles had reached the
"last stage of their long journey; at one end had been peace, reasonable"
"prosperity, and a happy home; at the other was, perhaps, a rope or a"
bullet.
"Dawson began once more to descant upon his own astuteness, but I was"
too sick at heart to listen. I remembered only the visit years before
"which that man's wife had paid to me. ""Will you not open the parcel?"""
"I interposed. He fell upon it, exposed its contents of bread,"
"chocolate, and sardine tins, and called for a can opener. He shook the"
"tins one by one beside his ear, and then, selecting that which gave"
"out no ""flop"" of oil, stripped it open, plunged his fingers inside,"
and pulled forth a clammy mess of putty and sawdust. In a moment he
had come upon a paper which after reading he handed to me. It bore the
"words in English, ""Informant arrested: dare not send more."""
"""What a fool!"" cried Dawson. ""As if the evidence against him were not"
"sufficient already he must give us this."""
"""You will let that poor devil of a draughtsman down easily?"" I"
murmured.
"""We want him as a witness,"" replied Dawson. ""Tit for tat. If he helps"
"us, we will help him. And now we will cut along to the Admiral. He is"
"eager for news."""
"We broke in upon the Admiral in his office near the shipyards, and he"
"greeted me with cheerful badinage. ""So you are in the hands of the"
"police at last, Copplestone. I always told you what would be the end"
"And the people answered her, and told her who it was. And when she"
"heard, she fell down upon the road as one dead: for it was her father"
"and mother who had died yesterday, and it was their funeral train that"
"she saw. They were all dead now, husband and sons and father and mother;"
in all the world she was quite alone.
"So she went mad, for her trouble was more than she could bear. She threw"
"off all her clothes, and let down her long hair and wrapped it about her"
"naked body, and walked about raving."
"At last she came to where the Buddha was teaching, seated under a"
"fig-tree. She came up to the Buddha, and told him of her losses, and how"
she had no one left; and she demanded of the Buddha that he should
restore to her those that she had lost. And the Buddha had great
"compassion upon her, and tried to console her."
"'All die,' he said; 'it comes to everyone, king and peasant, animal and"
man. Only through many deaths can we obtain the Great Peace. All this
"sorrow,' he said, 'is of the earth. All this is passion which we must"
"get rid of, and forget before we reach heaven. Be comforted, my"
"daughter, and turn to the holy life. All suffer as you do. It is part of"
"our very existence here, sorrow and trouble without any end.'"
"But she would not be comforted, but demanded her dead of the Buddha."
"Then, because he saw it was no use talking to her, that her ears were"
"deaf with grief, and her eyes blinded with tears, he said to her that he"
would restore to her those who were dead.
"'You must go,' he said, 'my daughter, and get some mustard-seed, a pinch"
"of mustard-seed, and I can bring back their lives. Only you must get"
this seed from the garden of him near whom death has never come. Get
"was a curious hush--a new thing in their struggle, and one that seemed"
surcharged with calamity. After a moment Colonel Carmichael looked up.
"He was many years the senior of his companions, but just then there"
"seemed no difference in years between them. They were three wan,"
"haggard men, weakened with hunger, exhausted with sleepless watching."
That week had killed the youth in two of them.
"""Geoffries has just given me this,"" Carmichael said. ""It is a list of"
"our provisions. We have enough food, but there is no fresh water. The"
enemy has cut off the supply. We could not expect them to do
"otherwise."" He waited, and then, as neither spoke, he went on: ""I have"
"spoken with the others. You know, gentlemen, we can not go on another"
"twenty-four hours without water. We have made a good fight for it, but"
"this is the end. We must look the fact in the face."""
"""Surely they must know at headquarters what a state we are in--"""
Saunders began.
The Colonel shrugged his shoulders.
"""No doubt they know, but they can not help in time. This is not a"
petty frontier business. It is something worse--a rising with a leader.
"A rising with a leader is a lengthy business to tackle, and it"
"requires its victims. In this case we are the victims."" He smiled"
"grimly. ""We have only one thing left to do--make a dash for it while we"
have the strength. You must know as well as I do that there is
"scarcely anything worth calling a hope, but it's a more agreeable way"
of dying than being starved out like rats and then butchered like
"sheep. I know these devils."" He glanced around the shadowy room with a"
"curious light in his eyes. ""My best friend was murdered in this room,"""
"he added. ""Personally, I prefer a fair fight in the open."""
"""That's the end o' that--that's the end o' that,"" she wound up, slamming"
the door after him. But all the way from the threshold to the bureau she
"kept murmuring to herself: ""I don't care, I don't care . . . I'll be"
like the rest o' the women I've seen. I'll give that Nina Micheltoreña
"cards an' spades. There'll be another hussy around here. There'll be--"""
"The threat was never finished. Instead, with eyes that fairly started"
"out of their sockets, she listened to the sound of a couple of shots,"
the last one exploding so loud and distinct that there was no mistaking
its nearness to the cabin.
"""They've got 'im!"" she cried. ""Well, I don't care--I don't--"" But again"
she did not finish what she intended to say. For at the sound of a heavy
"body falling against the cabin door she flew to it, opened it and,"
"throwing her arms about the sorely-wounded man, dragged him into the"
cabin and placed him in a chair. Quick as lightning she was back at the
door bolting it.
With his eyes Johnson followed her action.
"""Don't lock that door--I'm going out again--out there. Don't bar that"
"door,"" he commanded feebly, struggling to his feet and attempting to"
walk towards it; but he lurched forward and would have fallen to the
"floor had she not caught him. Vainly he strove to break away from her,"
"all the time crying out: ""Don't you see, don't you see, Girl--open the"
"door."" And then again with almost a sob: ""Do you think me a man to hide"
"behind a woman?"" He would have collapsed except for the strong arms that"
held him.
"""I love you an' I'm goin' to save you,"" the Girl murmured while"
"struggling with him. ""You asked me to go away with you; I will when you"
"git out o' this. If you can't save your own soul--"" She stopped and"
quickly went over to the mantel where she took down a bottle of whisky
"""Why? How can I tell? You said it was to make sure that the shore"
"party were all off the ship."""
"""I said! What does it matter what I say! What I do matters a heap, but"
what I say--pouf! I sent Trehayne to the _Antigone_ to test him. I
"sent him expecting that he would try to cut her wires, and he did."
"Then when I was sure, though I had no evidence for a law court, I sent"
"him to the _Malplaquet_, and I set my trap there for him to walk into."
How did I guess? I don't guess; I watch. The more valuable a man is to
"me, the more I watch him, for he might be even more valuable to"
"somebody else. Trehayne was an excellent man, but he had not been with"
me a month before I was watching him as closely as any cat. I hadn't
been a Marine and served ashore and afloat without knowing a born
"gentleman when I see one, and knowing, too, the naval stamp. Trehayne"
was too much of a gentleman to have become a workman in the _Vernon_
and at Greenock without some very good reason. He said that he was an
"orphan--yes; he said his parents left him penniless, and he had to"
"earn his living the best way he could--yes. Quite good reasons, but"
"they didn't convince me. I was certain sure that somewhere, some time,"
Trehayne had been a naval officer. I had seen too many during my
service to make any mistake about that. So when I stood there waiting
"in that damned cold corner behind that bulkhead, it was for Trehayne"
that I was waiting. I meant to take him or to kill him. When he killed
"himself, I was glad. As I watched his eyes fade out, it was as if my"
own son was dying on his feet in front of me. But it was better so
"than to die in front of a firing party. For I--I loved him, and I"
"wished him 'Good-bye,'"""
"Dawson pitched his cigar into the fire, got up, and walked away to the"
far side of the room. I had never till that moment completely
"reverenced the penetrative, infallible judgment of Little Jane."
"He was never short of money, for he had a purse which was never empty."
"He never was short of food, for he had a table-cloth on which, as soon"
"as he spread it, he found all he wanted to eat and drink. And, besides,"
he had a magic wishing cap. When he put it on he could wish himself
"wherever he wanted, and there he would be that very moment."
"There was only one thing that he lacked: he had no wife, and he was"
gradually coming into the years when it would be necessary for him to
make haste.
"As he was walking sadly along one fine day, it occurred to him to wish"
himself where he would find the most beautiful princess in the world. No
sooner had he thought of it than he was there. And it was a land which
"he had never yet seen, and a city in which he had never yet been. And"
"the king had a daughter, so handsome that he had never yet beheld her"
"like, and he wanted to have her on the spot. But she would have nothing"
"to do with him, and was very haughty."
"Finally he despaired altogether, and was so beside himself that he could"
no longer be where she was not. So he took his magic cap and wished
"himself into the castle. He wanted to say good-by, so he said. And she"
"laid her hand in his. ""I wish we were far beyond the end of the world!"""
"said the youth, and there they were. But the king's daughter wept, and"
begged to be allowed to go home again. He could have all the gold and
"silver in the castle in return. ""I have money enough for myself,"" said"
"the youth, and he shook his purse so that money just rolled about. He"
"could sit down at the royal table and eat the finest food, and drink the"
"finest wines, said she. ""I have enough to eat and drink myself,"" said"
"the youth. ""See, you can sit down at the table,"" said he, and at once he"
spread his table-cloth. And there stood a table covered with the best
one might wish; and the king himself ate no better.
"too. Besides, Josephine has little to play and be cheerful for; things"
"have gone badly this year, and may grow worse as time goes on. The"
"prospect is not a good one. ""But something will turn up,"" says Josephine."
"She need not worry, for she has money in the bank, and no doubt there is a"
"young man in the offing, on the other side of the fjeld."
"Oh, yes, Josephine will always manage; she thinks of everything. The other"
"day, for instance--when Miss Torsen and her friend left. The friend could"
"not pay his bill, and all he said was that he had expected money, but it"
"hadn't come, and he couldn't stay any longer because of his private"
"affairs. That was all very well, but when would the bill be paid? Why, he"
"would send it from the town, of course; that was where he had his money!"
"""But how do we know we'll get the money?--from him, anyway,"" said"
"Josephine. ""We've had these actor-people here before. And I didn't like"
"the way he swanked about outside, thinking he was as good as anybody, and"
throwing his stick up in the air and catching it again. And then when Miss
"Torsen came in to say good-bye, I told her, and I wondered if she couldn't"
"let me have the money for him. Miss Torsen was shocked, and said, 'Hasn't"
"he paid himself?' 'No,' I said, 'he hasn't, and this year being such a bad"
"one, we need every penny.' So then Miss Torsen said of course we should"
"get the money; how much was it? And I told her, and she said she couldn't"
"pay for him now, but she would see the money was sent; we could trust her"
"for that. And I think we can, too. We'll get the money all right, if not"
"from him. I daresay she'll send it herself...."""
And Josephine went off to serve me my dinner.
"Paul is on his feet now, too. Not that his step is always very steady, but"
at least he puts his feet to the ground. But he takes no interest in
things; he does little more than feeding the horses and chopping some
wood. He ought to be clearing the manure out of the summer cow houses for
"himself into an armchair with another laugh, telling Grey he was sorry"
"his knaves of servants, who looked for perquisites everywhere, had let"
"in this flood of rogues upon him, but added that he must needs have the"
"wherewithal to cut a proper figure in London town, and forthwith set"
about the business of ordering an outfit for the young man which almost
took his guest’s breath away.
"""Poof!"" he cried, when the latter strove to remonstrate, ""you have"
plenty of money; and these rascals can wait if it suits your pleasure.
"Father’s memory!  Oh, be hanged to all such mawkish sentiment!  You need"
not think less of your father because you wear a blue coat in lieu of a
black! Rabbit me! but you are of a different world from this if you keep
"alive your father’s memory for six months after his decease!  No, no;"
you must cut a figure.  Sir Hugh’s name is clean forgot by now. I’ll eat
my boots if ’tis not so.  I’ll have you as gay as my fancy paints you.
"No black—no sables for the gentleman, I tell you.  Let us see those"
"other patterns.  Ah! here is something more like."""
"Grey submitted.  In sooth, he cared but little for the colour of his"
"clothes, or the set of his hat, or the cut of his coat.  He let Lord"
"Sandford have his way for the most part, only insisting here and there"
"upon soft and tender tints, and showing a predilection for white, which"
his friend quite approved.
"""You shall be a foil to me, not a rival.  I have learned that art from"
the ladies.  I like to blaze like old Sol in his strength; you shall
rather recall gentle Luna amid her galaxy of stars.  Faugh! One’s tongue
"gets into this silly trick of speech, so that one cannot drop it even"
betwixt man and man!  But you are right to think that white becomes you
"well.  You will look a pretty fellow, in all conscience, when you have"
"added a peruke to your other adornments."""
which had acted upon him like a charm.  It brought back to him the
"memory of his mother, and her noble dignity.  The look in her eyes"
"recalled those things that he had learned at her knee, and those"
aspirations after true greatness of life which she had cherished and
"fostered. Suddenly his present life looked to him utterly sordid, mean,"
"and unworthy; and in a burst of confidence, for which he could have"
"given no reason, he told her all his tale, encouraged by the soft and"
"earnest glances of her beautiful eyes, although she scarcely spoke a"
word from beginning to end.
And now she looked at him with a great compassion in her face.
"""Oh, it is sad, it is sad!"" she said in her earnest musical tones.  ""I"
know a little how sad it is.  I see it too.  But you are a man.  You are
"strong, you are your own master.  Why do you let yourself be made the"
"sport and plaything of fate?  Oh, do not do it! Rise to your calling as"
"a man, as a gentleman, as a Christian!  You can—I know you can!  I read"
it in your face!  What is Lord Sandford to you? The acquaintance of a
few weeks.  What are his comrades to you?  You know that in your heart
you despise them.  Then will you make yourself as one of them?  Will you
"sink to their level?  Oh no, no, no!  Break the fetters; they cannot be"
"fast riveted yet.  Break them, and stand a free man, and then see what"
"the world has to offer you."""
"She was gazing at him now, not shyly, not as a maiden archly coquetting"
"with a handsome young swain, but as a woman yearning to reclaim one"
"whose footsteps had well-nigh slipped in the mire, and whose whole soul"
was stirred by the effort.
"Grey listened like a man who dreams; and yet his eyes were on fire, and"
"his heart was kindled to a great flame—shame at his own weakness,"
yearnings after vanished memories and half-forgotten aspirations
"the train. In vain. The train inexorably pursues its course. Prancing,"
she reaches one end of the platform as we leave the other end. Then she
"realizes it is not going to stop for her. And then, oh horror, her long"
arms thrown out in wild supplication after the retreating train: then
flung aloft to God: then brought down in absolute despair on her head.
"And this is the last sight we have of her, clutching her poor head in"
agony and doubling forward. She is left--she is abandoned.
The poor fat husband has been all the time on the little outside
"platform at the end of the carriage, holding out his hand to her and"
shouting frenzied scolding to her and frenzied yells for the train to
stop. And the train has not stopped. And she is left--left on that
God-forsaken station in the waning light.
"So, his face all bright, his eyes round and bright as two stars,"
"absolutely transfigured by dismay, chagrin, anger and distress, he comes"
"and sits in his seat, ablaze, stiff, speechless. His face is almost"
beautiful in its blaze of conflicting emotions. For some time he is as
if unconscious in the midst of his feelings. Then anger and resentment
"crop out of his consternation. He turns with a flash to the long-nosed,"
"insidious, Phoenician-looking guard. Why couldn't they stop the train"
"for her! And immediately, as if someone had set fire to him, off flares"
the guard. Heh!--the train can't stop for every person's convenience!
The train is a train--the time-table is a time-table. What did the old
woman want to take her trips down the line for? Heh! She pays the
penalty for her own inconsiderateness. Had _she_ paid for the
train--heh? And the fat man all the time firing off his unheeding and
"unheeded answers. One minute--only one minute--if he, the conductor had"
"told the driver! if he, the conductor, had shouted! A poor woman! Not"
another train! What was she going to do! Her ticket? And no money. A
poor woman--
"her, too! I only wish that I might get the chance to see her sometime!"""
"said he. ""Well, just wait until to-morrow,"" said the giant, ""and then I"
"will lead you to her myself,"" he said. ""A thousand thanks, master,"" said"
"the king's son, ""but I think you are only joking!"" The following day the"
giant took him to the Master Girl.
"""Now you must slaughter him, and cook him in the big kettle, you know"
"which one I mean. And when the soup is ready, you can call me,"" said the"
"giant, and he lay down on the bench to sleep, and at once began to snore"
"so that the hills shook. Then the Master Girl took a knife, and cut the"
"youth's little finger, and let three drops of blood fall on the bench."
"Then she took all the old rags, and old shoes and other rubbish she"
"could find, and threw them all into the kettle. And then she took a"
"chest of gold-dust, and a lick-stone, and a bottle of water that hung"
"over the door, and a golden apple, and two golden hens, and left the"
giant's castle together with the king's son as quickly as possible.
"After a time they came to the sea, and they sailed across; though where"
they got the ship I do not exactly know.
"Now when the giant had been sleeping quite a while, he began to stretch"
"himself on his bench. ""Is dinner ready yet?"" he asked. ""Just begun!"""
said the first drop of blood on the bench. Then the giant turned
"around, went to sleep again, and went on sleeping for quite some time."
"Then he again turned around a little. ""Is dinner not ready yet?"" he"
"said, but did not open his eyes--nor had he done so the first time--for"
"he was still half asleep. ""It is half ready!"" called out the second drop"
"of blood, and then the giant thought it was the Master Girl. He turned"
around on the bench and took another nap. After he had slept a couple of
"hours longer, he once more began to move about and stretch: ""Is dinner"
"still not ready?"" said he. ""Ready!"" answered the third drop of blood."
The giant sat up and rubbed his eyes. But he could not see who had
"called him, and so he called out to the Master Girl. But no one answered"
"The event increased our uneasiness. After each ""bombing-stunt"" we"
"thought: ""We were lucky this time--it will be our turn next though."""
"Moreover, we began to realize our helplessness. We were compelled to"
remain in our tents during a raid and there was no possibility of taking
shelter. We could have put on our steel helmets--they would at least
"have afforded some head protection, but hardly any of us had the courage"
to do anything that might be regarded by the others as a sign of fear.
The discussion about the bombing of hospitals had made us all think of
air-raids. We had nearly finished our day's work when we noticed a few
clouds on the horizon. We felt relieved. Perhaps the sky would be
overcast and we would have an undisturbed night.
"""I can't stick night raids,"" said one of our number. ""They don't put my"
"wind up a bit, but they interfere with my sleep and make me feel tired"
"in the mornings."""
A man who had been in the war from the beginning answered:
"""I can see you haven't been out here long, and have never been in a"
proper raid. I'll never forget the last time we were bombed. We were out
on rest about fifteen miles behind the line. Fritz came over and I had
the wind up so badly that I left the tent to go into the open fields.
"(I'd had a taste of it before, you know, and that makes all the"
difference.) Then he bombed us before I knew where I was. I ran for my
life. There was a hell of a crash behind me and a bit caught me in the
shoulder and knocked me down. When it was all over I got up and went
"back, although my shoulder hurt like anything. A lot of our fellows were"
"running about and shouting. Where my tent used to be, there was a big"
bomb-hole and my mates were lying dead all round--fourteen of them. I
"didn't recognize most of them, they were so smashed up. Fritz had"
dropped one right on the tent. I reckon I was lucky to get off with a
We went down the fortress-stair to the eating-room. Here was a long
table with soup-plates upside down and a lamp burning an uncanny naked
"acetylene flame. We sat at the cold table, and the lamp immediately"
"began to wane. The room--in fact the whole of Sardinia--was stone cold,"
"stone, stone cold. Outside the earth was freezing. Inside there was no"
"thought of any sort of warmth: dungeon stone floors, dungeon stone walls"
"and a dead, corpse-like atmosphere, too heavy and icy to move."
"The lamp went quite out, and the q-b gave a cry. The brown woman poked"
her head through a hole in the wall. Beyond her we saw the flames of the
"cooking, and two devil-figures stirring the pots. The brown woman came"
and shook the lamp--it was like a stodgy porcelain mantelpiece
"vase--shook it well and stirred up its innards, and started it going"
"once more. Then she appeared with a bowl of smoking cabbage soup, in"
which were bits of macaroni: and would we have wine? I shuddered at the
"thought of death-cold red wine of the country, so asked what else there"
"was. There was malvagia--malvoisie, the same old malmsey that did for"
"the Duke of Clarence. So we had a pint of malvagia, and were comforted."
"At least we were being so, when the lamp went out again. The brown woman"
"came and shook and smacked it, and started it off again. But as if to"
"say ""Shan't for you"", it whipped out again."
"Then came the host with a candle and a pin, a large, genial Sicilian"
with pendulous mustaches. And he thoroughly pricked the wretch with the
"pin, shook it, and turned little screws. So up flared the flame. We were"
"a little nervous. He asked us where we came from, etc. And suddenly he"
"asked us, with an excited gleam, were we Socialists. Aha, he was going"
to hail us as citizens and comrades. He thought we were a pair of
Bolshevist agents: I could see it. And as such he was prepared to
"embrace us. But no, the q-b disclaimed the honor. I merely smiled and"
shook my head. It is a pity to rob people of their exciting illusions.
known the post-Renaissance Jesus. Which is rather an eye-opener.
"Not that they are suspicious or uneasy. On the contrary, noisy,"
"assertive, vigorous presences. But with none of that implicit belief"
"that everybody will be and ought to be good to them, which is the mark"
of our era. They don't expect people to be good to them: they don't want
"it. They remind me of half-wild dogs that will love and obey, but which"
won't be handled. They won't have their heads touched. And they won't be
fondled. One can almost hear the half-savage growl.
"The long stocking caps they wear as a sort of crest, as a lizard wears"
"his crest at mating time. They are always moving them, settling them on"
"their heads. One fat fellow, young, with sly brown eyes and a young"
"beard round his face folds his stocking-foot in three, so that it rises"
over his brow martial and handsome. The old boy brings his stocking-foot
over the left ear. A handsome fellow with a jaw of massive teeth pushes
his cap back and lets it hang a long way down his back. Then he shifts
"it forward over his nose, and makes it have two sticking-out points,"
"like fox-ears, above his temples. It is marvellous how much expression"
these caps can take on. They say that only those born to them can wear
"them. They seem to be just long bags, nearly a yard long, of black"
stockinette stuff.
The conductor comes to issue them their tickets. And they all take out
rolls of paper money. Even a little mothy rat of a man who sits opposite
me has quite a pad of ten-franc notes. Nobody seems short of a hundred
francs nowadays: nobody.
They shout and expostulate with the conductor. Full of coarse life they
"are: but so coarse! The handsome fellow has his sleeved waistcoat open,"
"and his shirt-breast has come unbuttoned. Not looking, it seems as if he"
"wears a black undervest. Then suddenly, one sees it is his own hair. He"
"dipped in a lock of his hair, and it came out like pure gold, and fairly"
shimmered.
"Then the king's son said: ""Better and better! But if he cooks gold here,"
"I wonder what he cooks inside, there?"" And he wanted to see, so he went"
into the fourth room. Here there was no kettle to be seen; but a maiden
sat on a bench who must have been a king's daughter; yet whatever she
"might be, the king's son had never seen any one so beautiful in all his"
"days. ""Now in heaven's name, what are you doing here?"" asked the maiden."
"""I hired myself out here yesterday,"" said the king's son. ""May God be"
"your aid, for it is a fine service you have chosen!"" said she. ""O, the"
"master is very friendly,"" said the king's son. ""He has given me no hard"
"work to do to-day. When I have cleaned out the stable, I need do nothing"
"more."" ""Yes, but how are you going to manage it?"" she went on. ""If you"
"do as the others have done, then for every shovelful you pitch out, ten"
fresh shovelfuls will fly in. But I'll tell you how to go about it. You
"must turn around the shovel, and work with the handle, then everything"
"will fly out by itself."""
"This he would do, said the king's son; and he sat there with her all day"
"long, for they had soon agreed that they would marry, he and the king's"
"daughter, and in this way his first day in the giant's service did not"
"weary him at all. When evening came on, she told him that now he must"
"clean out the stable before the giant came, and when he got there he"
"thought he would try out her advice, and began to use the shovel as he"
"had seen his father's grooms use it. And sure enough, he had to stop"
"quickly, for after he had worked a little while, he hardly had room in"
"which to stand. Then he did as the king's daughter had told him, turned"
the shovel around and used the handle. And in a wink the stable was as
clean as though it had been scrubbed. When he had finished he went
"to the room that the giant had assigned him, and walked up and down,"
"whistling and singing. Then the giant came home with his goats. ""Have"

"Which way, Tony?"
Which way?
Keep moving straight ahead.
This is the house.
"Here, look."
Come on.
Down here.
"Be quiet, Alfred, you silly thing."
Tia!
Tony!
I've put her into a state of comatose neutralization.
"Hey, Tia."
We got you some cold hotcakes.

"Alfred, what's the matter with me?"
Where am I?
Are you sorry for--?
Are you sorry for having offended God and for all the sins of your past life?
-Where do you want this?
-What?
Phonograph.
Storage.
That's everything.
I'm gonna miss you.
Same here.
Sure you won't change your mind?
I found this in her room.
You better hurry.
"Come on, honey, we have to get going."
She doesn't remember any of it.
That's good.
-All done.
-Okay.
"Honey, this is Father Dyer."
"-Hi, Father."

I'll call you.
Bye.

Lieutenant.
"Marin, Claire, Lisa..."
Come visit me in Korea.
Definitely.
Promise.
Promise!
Do you eat spicy food?

"Let me guess, was it your sister?"
My sister's a por...
It was my girlfriend.
The phone.
Front desk speaking.
What?
No hot water in the bath?
"I'm sorry, we'll send someone right away."
Excuse me?
"Oh, sure, we'll bring one."
Sorry about that.
Room 311 has no hot water in the bath.
Room 311?
"Hurry, go."
You go instead.
"It's your job to deal with customer complaints, no?"
"Please, go for me."
And you call yourself a man?
"Wait, take a condom."
The room was missing one.
No hot water?
Asshole.
"Ow, what the hell?"
Why aren't you angry?
Find a way to stall that wedding!
Stall the wedding.
W-What am I?
What?
That's it!
Move it!
Let's go!
We got an emergency here.
Dearly beloved--
"Don't worry, Ariel."
We-We're gonna make it.
We're-- We're almost there.
"Yes, um, do you, Eric, take Vanessa... to be your lawfully wedded wife... for as long as you both shall live?"
I do.
It being-- And do you--
Oh!
Then by the power--
"Get away from me, you slimy little--"
"Oh, why, you little--"
Huh?
Ahh.
Huh?

- You're the one.
"- Eric, get away from her."
- It-It was you all the time.
"- Oh, Eric, I-I wanted to tell you."
"Eric, no!"
You're too late!
"And I feel sorry for you, Dean."
"You feel sorry for me, huh?"
Don't feel sorry for me.
You don't know anything about me.
I save lives.
I'm a hero.
A hero!
What?
"Way to go, Sam."
"Good job, buddy."
"Damn, nice job, Winchester."
Sam!
Great job!
"- Nice, Sam."
- Sam the man.
"Hey, Sam, good job, man."
Dad?
Finally.
I can't wait to get the hell out of here.
This place sucks.
"Come on, Sam."
Mr. Wyatt?
Yes.
You probably don't remember me.
"But my name is Sam Winchester, and..."
I just wanted to thank you.
For?
"I was a student here, and you gave me some advice once."
"Winchester, right."
Right.
Yeah.
"You, uh -- You wrote that horror story."
"Did she tell you, Hugh?"
My horse died.
Pie-O-My?
That's too bad.
"-God, this wine."
-There was a fire at the stables.
She had to be destroyed.
You should've seen her.
"String beans, Hugh?"
"-Baby, what happened?"
-He got jacked by some spics.
"-They took his ride, his fucking watch,too."
"-Jesus Christ, the Cartier?"
"-Christopher, you're bleeding."
-Stop touching it.
-Do you think I could get some money?
-What?
-Who are you?
-Eddie.
-From down the park.
"-He's good people, Adriana."
I took him home.
"He was all fucked up, but I straightened him out."
He owes me $30.
-Get the fuck out of here.
-What?
Get out of my house.
"-Don't stiff me on this, man."
-Get out!
What's the matter with you?
The guy's my friend.
That's your friend?
[ Piano Continues ]
How you doin'?
"Oh, fine, thank you."
You Tickler?
"Yes, sir."
"Well, Rick sent me."
He said you used to work the Wiki-Wiki Club on Hotel Street during the war.
[ Chuckles ] Sure did.
Great club.
Lot of action.
Lot of fun.
Lines for everything.
Even to hear my music.
Times sure have changed.
- She work there?
- [ Tickler ] Oh.
Pretty lady.
Yeah.
You remember her?
"You know, her face does look kind of familiar."
Her name's Diane Westmore.
Yeah.
Diane.
Nice girl.
I remember when she died.
Lot of people cried.
She died?
That's right.
During the war.
The big one.
"In a car accident with some flyboy from Wheeler, I think."
- You sure it was Diane Westmore?
YOU'RE SO TALL.
WHAT IS THIS?
LET ME HAVE A LOOK AT YOU.
LET ME SEE.
"OH NO, PRAMOD."
YOU'RE TALLER THAN ME.
"WHAT IS THIS, PRAMOD?"
WHAT IS THIS?
WHAT IS THIS?
AND YOU GOT NEW GOALS AND EVERYTHING.
- ARE YOU HAPPY WITH THAT?
- YES.
- MISSED ME?

"PRAMOD, I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT SOMETHING."
YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER RIGHT AWAY
BECAUSE I'M STAYING HERE ALL WEEK.
- OKAY?
- YES.
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME AND LIVE WITH ME
IN DENMARK?
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T THINK SO.
"BUT YOU KNOW, WE CAN COME AND VISIT"
AS MUCH AS WE WANT TO.
BUT I WANT TO STAY HERE.
EVERYTHING IS SO GOOD HERE NOW.
I DON'T WANT TO LIVE THERE.
YOU DON'T LIKE PEOPLE THERE.
YOU SAID SO YOURSELF.
"YES, BUT YOU--"
"BUT THEN WE WON'T SEE EACH OTHER, PRAMOD."
-Shut up!
Shut up!
-Why the fuck did you do this?
-I'm sorry.
Stay back!

"Come in, goddamn it."
Hurry up.
"Hurricane, where the hell have you been?"
I need help out here.
What's your 10-20?
"Oh, God."
"Dale, what's your 20?"
Where are you?
"I'm off the highway, two miles down Sulphur Springs road."
There's a house.
"In the woods, there's this house--"
Is there an address?
I don't know the goddamn address.
Just send some help.
And an ambulance.
I got three suspects down and I'm hurtpretty bad.
-Three suspects down.

"I mean, I really like the person.."
Wow!
Beautiful.
Excellent.
Fantastic.
That's really nice.
Adi.
Wonderful!
Wonderful!
Did you make this?
- No.
Gul has made it.
You were saying she doesn't know anything.
She knows many things.
Okay.
"- Actually, I was wrong about her talent."
Rectify your mistake.
She should be promoted.
Where is she?
Where is Gul?
"She was toiling the whole night, sir."
She is sleeping.
"Hey, Pia."
- Hey.
"Hey, Gul."
Where were you the whole night?
Don't ask.
"All right, all right!"
"One, two, three, four..."
"All right, get back."
Nobody touch that dog.
"five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, one, two-"
Dog is gonna draw a sled.
Just stand there.
The dog will do it!
It's plenty load for one dog to pull.
The dog will do it!
"Five, six, seven, eight, nine-"
"Keep your hands off that dog, now!"
You understand?
"Oh, I beg your pardon."
"Seven, eight, nine, a hundred."
"Go on, mister."
We're waiting.

(WATER RUNNING)
Lila?
Dale.
"How you doing, baby?"
Stop right there.
Turn around.
Turn around.
Put your hands on the counter where I can see them.
And spread your legs.
Simon says.
Can I turn around now?
Why don't you just stay like that?
You don't know?
[raucous laughter]
"Robin, you're crazy!"
I like this girl.
Normal.
Everything's normal.
Ahh!
Is this the new futon?
"- Yes, it is, in fact."
"- Yeah, yeah."
We just bought it together.
It's my new favorite thing.
And... and you know it turns into a bed?
"So really, it's like two things."
A couch that turns into a bed?
"Yeah, I'll believe it when I see it."
"Yeah, right?"
"All right, watch this."
"Oh, oh, oh, okay."
- Okay.
"- All right, ready?"
- All right.

You have some more orders?
Get Chang Seventh out there!
Your timing's bad-he's on the mountain!
Search the place!
"What're you doing, Brother Chin?"
He really isn't here!
"Mr. Wang, Master wants to build a house here"
You'll have to move out!
Come here!

"Oh, fuck, I can't."
He's my dad.
Please?

First and second rib?
Here?

(AIR WHOOSHING OUT)
That's it?
"That's the air coming out, right?"
Yes.
"Jacoub, why are we slowing down?"
I don't know.
The gas...
We must've been hit at the checkpoint.
Under that tree.
"Pull up to that side, pull over."
Okay.
That's good.
"Just keep looking into my eyes, Dad."
This fellow...
"Hello, Sir."
- Where are you?
"I am chasing an accused in high speed, Sir!"
I'll talk later.
I can't even catch such a slow-runner!
I...
Varun!
Idiot!
Will you keep breaking rules just because you are a cop?
You are always interfering a responsible cop on duty!
Get lost!
Leave me!
I said leave me!
Why are you after me?
What do you want?
"Sir, leave me!"
"Leave me, Sir!"
What wrong did I do?
Sir...
- Got it?
Sir!
There's nothing in it.
Please give it.
Stay quiet.
Unlock it.
- Leave me!
Give me the phone!
- Hey...
Unlock it!
Sir!
- Stay quiet!
"Goodbye, but I hope we don't meet again."
But that's the other one!
- It's not him.
And then?
- What about the bail?
"Counselor, it's not fair!"
- This is a mistake!
"One moment, stop!"
You arrest me again?
"- Come on, come on!"
Why did I have to..
"- Come on, no stories!"
- I was freed!
They're bringing me back to jail?
- Calm down or else.
"I must leave, I'm an honest man!"
"- Yeah, right."
How is this possible?
- Goddamn you!
"Wanted to cheat me again, huh?"
Get inside!
Got it?
Here's the walking papers.
OK.
Goodbye.

"How do you manage to read the paper... drink the flowers, water the coffee... all by yourself?"
That's...
This can't be true.
Why did I fall asleep?
Don't worry.
Some joyrider will probably dump it somewhere.
"- Yeah, sure."
- What was in the car?
"Clothes, Christmas presents, all kinds of stuff."
I gotta go.

He shouldn't have shot.
The place is crawling with tree niggers.
HENRY:

We're still in Ree territory.
He's one of our own men.

Beautiful.
"Okay, boys, let's eat."
"Come on, Johnny, Vinnie."

"Yeah, you going for a walk in the park?"
I'll catch you next week.

-Go right up front.

Jesus Christ!
You want her to visit you?
Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
What am I doing here?
Where am I?
Now get in there.
Come on.
Enjoy yourself!
(LAUGHS)
"Call me son, yeah?"
"Hi, I'm Philip."
My name is Philip.
- Hello.
- WOMAN:
Hi.
"I know who you are, but it's a real pleasure."
- An old friend of Ike's.
- How do you know each other?
"Well, I've never met him personally, but, um..."
- You've heard of me.
- I've read.
I've read who I think you are.
- WOMAN:
Wow.
"- Yeah, he's... you know who he is, correct?"
"No, should we know who he is?"
"- Yeah, he's one of the..."
- I don't know whether you should...
- I...
I write.
- He's what they call essential.
- A writer.
- Like the profession.
"This guy is like, they teach this guy."
- You know...
"- Oh, really?"
"Yeah, I'm gonna just go check really quickly on the lord of the manor."
.
I'm going to go.
I don't really know anyone.
Maybe I'll see you there.
Bye.
- Don't leave me out here.
"- One drink, real quick."
What the hell is he doing here?
"Captain, he's here."
- Hi.
- Hi.
You look... different.
I'll take that as a compliment.
- I didn't think I'd see you here.
- Nobody did.
"Tommy, you made it."
"Good to see you, man."
"Come on, the whole family's right over here."
"- Dad, look who's here."
- He's got Tommy with him.
Let him go.
Don't keep them waiting.
"- Tommy, good to see you, son."
"- Hi, Uncle Fred."
- Introduce your date.
- She's not my date.
"This is my new partner, Jo Christman."
"Unfortunately, these are the Hardys."
My Uncle Fred.
- My cousin Gary.
- Don't fuck her.
"Tommy, you're too skinny."
- Grandma?
- I didn't know you.
"Ma'am, you can't just walk into our dressing rooms."
The showis underway.
"Please, get out."
- I'm Marcia's mother.
- What?
My apologies.
- I didn't know.
- Thank you.
"Darling, your mother never brought you for a visit."
I brought you some very tasty treats.
Here.
Do you like it?
It's all yours.
- All of it?
- All yours.
Your grandma will give you anything you want.
It's our turn.
Can you wait here?
Marcia will be right over to see you.
"Great, thanks."
"Hang tight, sweetie."
Mommy is on her way.
"The crowd is waiting, Barbuda!"
"There's more here, darling."
More?
"Yes, and it's all yours."
Do you like it?
Let's take a walk with grandma now.
What about mom?
Mommy is working.
Look behind you!
"The giant, it's attacking!"
It's stomping the town!
I was right!
- Sweet mother of God.
- MANSLEY:
"Look, damn you!"
(ENGINE ROARING)
I am not a gun.
"Hey, Mom."
(ROARS)
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
Let's get out of here!
Run!
(GASPS)
Hey.
Stop!
There's a kid in his hands!
Stop shooting!
Kent!
He only reacts defensively.
"If you don't shoot, he's harmless."
You gotta tell the General!
"This is all your fault, beatnik."
If you hadn't...
Would you shut up and listen?
You've gotta make them stop.
The giant's got the kid with him.
I'll take care of it.
He says the monster's killed a kid.
"Sir, we must stop it at all costs."
Go to code red.
Are you hurt?
Are you all right?
Painted Face is back!
I'm scared!
- Get rid of him!
- OK.
"Foon, it was a good idea to come back!"
She's back in my arms again.
"Old pal, let's impress her one more time."
Watch this!
- Are you OK?
"- Yeah, I just tripped."
"Foon, you're overacting."
Painted Face!
We're in trouble!
This is a different guy!
Help!
Help!
- I'm here!
- Let's go!
Come on!
- Faster!
- I'm spilling my wine!
"- Sifu Wong, are you abandoning me?"
- Aren't I holding you tight?
You've been holding my hand the whole night!
Are you crazy?
I'm going crazy!
I've been possessed by a demon!
Exorcism is my forte.
Where's the ghost?
Where's the ghost?
Cartridges?
"Certainly, sir."
Any particular make?
"No, as long as they've got gunpowder in them."
- What bore?
- Boar?
"No, no."
"A few rabbits, pheasants, small fry, you know."
"No, no, sir."
Bore.
B-O-R-E.
Bore!
(Laughs)
- Hmm?
"- 12, 20 or 4-10?"
Er...
"Definitely, yes."
"Well, which, sir?"
"Well, the largest you have, surely."
12-bore.
"How many, sir?"
50?
"No, I think you'd better make it a thousand."
- A thousand?
!
- Yes.
But didn't you say a day's rough shooting?
"Yes, I did, er..."
and it may be pretty rough.
"On second thoughts, I think you'd better make it 1,500, perhaps?"
Right.
"That's whisky, gin, sherry, tea, coffee, cocoa - all Mickey Finned."
.
When do you think is she coming back?
-Wait a second.
-Oh sure!
-Just a minute.
"-Oh my, the foods are delicious!"
You should've tried everything!
When it gets cold it won't be as tasty anymore.
"You like that, right?"
.
Oh my!
I'm really excited for you.
You two can now make a family!
"Oh, don't mind me!"
I didn't see you in the church a while ago.
"It's just, I looked for you."
-My wife is so beautiful.
-You're really such a joker.
-But it's not that.
-Here you go again.
-Oh come on!
-Really!
So Joy...
Where are we?
"So, does it mean you're the only one who has surprises for me?"
.
Is that okay?
Is that okay?
.
Is that okay?
-It's beautiful!
-I told you!
But it's not yours to keep.
Great!
Really great.
And so began our summer with Tetra.
"He lived in my closet like an old friend, ...who'd been there for years."
"Hello, Misaki!"
Hello.
Is Yusuki home?
He's been in his room all morning ...just go on in.
Anybody home?
Whassup...
"How is he, Yusuki?"
I'm so sorry!
You gave me a fright.
Didn't you hear me?
Sorry.
"But boy, you scared me!"
My heart's thumping.
Stuff for Tetra.
Thanks.
Here's the aluminum.
How about this?
Let's ask Tetra!
Choose what you need.
He's so cute!
He likes that.
What's he making?
Dunno.
"But there's lots of parts, ...and he's real quick."
We interrupting?
Don't just barge in.
Your Mom said it was okay.
Oh.
"Oh, no."
Can this be evil?
Dr. Jekyll.
Dr. Jekyll?
"- What's happening, sir?"
Are you all right?
- What is it?
What do you want?
"Is that you, Dr. Jekyll?"
"Now, wait a minute."
"Wait a minute, Poole."
"Dr. Jekyll, who is that in there?"
"Dr. Jekyll, answer me, sir."
"Yes, Poole?"
"I'm sorry, sir, but I..."
I heard an odd noise and a strange voice.
"I thought something was happening, sir."
"No, no, no."
"It's quite all right, Poole."
There was someone here.
A friend of mine.
A Mr. Hyde.
I let him out the back door.
"Oh, I see, sir."
"Very good, sir."
"Miss Beatrix is here, sir."
"I showed her into the consulting room, sir."
"I hope I did right, sir."
"Yes, yes, that was quite right, Poole."
Tell Miss Beatrix I'll be there immediately.
"Very good, sir."
- He's in the next room.
- So the chocolate was for him?
- Mel...
- It was a retropharyngeal hematoma.
- What?
I snuck a look at his CT results.
- So he wasn't choked.
- No.
It happened earlier.
Probably from the fall.
I need to go.
My place after shift?
Sure.
Why not?
- I was getting worried.
- I can't do this.
- What?
"Tash, stop..."
"- Griff, just stop."
That's my sponsor.
I texted her.
"- What, you're in the program all of a sudden?"
"- Yeah, I am."
Come on!
I was sober for 8 months
- before you showed up at my door tonight.
"- Tash, listen."
"We can work out the whole stripping thing,"
"I was being an idiot, OK?"
Don't leave!
"If you leave, I'll have nothing."
We have a future.
"No, not for you."
Ready now?
Hold on.
What?
Snacks.
THANK YOU...
You're not to have one.
"Yeah, yeah."
Watch your language.
Whatever.
You handled that well.
We should be okay now.
"Look, here he is!"
Walking by himself!
He did it!
So cute!
"Tetra, bodywork complete."
Tetra wants to use the internet.
But no-one's got a computer.
How about at school?
"It was stolen, remember?"
The new one's kept locked.
Especially during vacation.
How do you know?
"Well, I just know..."
What about PlayStation2?
No way!
Can you?
Even though it ain't a computer?
I read it somewhere.
You sure?
- How do you do it?
There are two kinds of metal in this yard.
Scrap and art.
"If you gotta eat one of them, eat the scrap."
What you currently have in your mouth is art!
Art?
(METAL CREAKING)
"Oh, forget it."
Forget it!
It's gone.
It's...
Hmm.
That's not bad.
HOGARTH:
"First, you take a chocolate bar."
Any bar'll do.
- Oh.
"- Do you mind if I, uh..."
"No, knock yourself out, skipper."
You crumble up the chocolate into little pieces.
Then you kind of stir it into the ice cream.
See?
"Yes, I see."
What do you call this again?
Landslide.
It's new.
Very new.
Mmm.
Landslide.
Topnotch.
Mmm.
"You know, Hogarth, we live in a strange and wondrous time."
The Atomic Age.
- I'll get some lemonade for you!
"- No, I don't want it!"
"Don't be silly, Mimì."
"Drink some, it'll do you good."
"- Here's a wet handkerchief, is that better?"
- Yes.
"I'm sorry if I made you mad, it's all my fault."
- Does your tummy hurt?
- A bit.
"- Does it really, really hurt?"
"- And if I give you a little kiss, will it still hurt?"
- I don't know.
"Shall we try, then?"
"Kids, come on, cut it out!"
Here's your lemonade.
"- No, I don't want it!"
- Come on.
- You don't want it?
- Don't be silly now.
- No!
"- Bonsoir, Monsieur!"
Excuse me...
- C'est complet!
"- Ah, no..."
- C'est complet.
Does a Mr. Raffaele D'Amore live here?
He has a moustache.
"Oui, il demeure ici, mais il n'est pas rentré."
- He's come in?
Now?
"- No, il n'est pas encore rentré."
"- Ah, he's not back yet."
Whoo!
Here you go.
"Thank you, son."
What's this?
Boiled skunk?
Some herbs.
They'll help with the cough.
"I'm proud of you, Daddy."
"You've made me proud too, son."
"Grown into a fine man, yes, sir."
I'm glad I got to see it.
Here.
I made this for your horse.
It's a bridle.
It's beautiful.
I came all this way.
Want to bring my son a present.
You already did.
You already did.
[ORGAN playing ]
MAUDE:
Yah!
Giddyup.
"-Aw, hell."
-Where do you think you're going?
-You didn't think for a moment...
"... Iwasgonnamarrythat dreadfulman, did you?"
You--
You signed a contract.
"Yes, and he dropped the charges."
I'm free as a bird.
"-Well, what am I supposed to do?"
Hello.
Okay.
He asked me to come in.
My daughter!
- Stop!
Don't hurt her.
Have you brought the money?
Who is that?
!
Who is the that?
!
He is someone I know.
Just give him the money.
They might hurt her.
Give it to him.
- How much have you brought?
How much?
- It's not cash.
It's jewellery.
Jewellery?
Are you mocking me?
I asked for cash.
Are you trying to trap me with the jewels?
"Oldie, looks like you don't want your daughter back alive!"
Leave her!
Time out!
Collect her pieces and go!
The jewels are worth more than the money they owe you!
Don't rush.
Let her go!
Please!
Take it and leave her!
He can not get away from us.
There is the informer!
I can see him.
Yes.
Two shots to the head should be enough.
- Here they come.
- We necks him inside the toilet.
"You bastard, Wagner."
Now necks we need you!
"Stand still, Frank Wagner!"
Moving on!
Moving on!
Come on!
Hey!
Back!
Back!
Let him kill the pig!
Could not have waited a little longer?
- Have you seen the Russians?
- I saw them on the other side.
- Shit!
- Beware!
Femmanhuset!
Give me the gun!
Lasse van.
Turn on the laser.
Downwardly.
There.
Nak is a bitch.
Matched.
Hands over your head!
"Frank, I'm out on seven to eight years."
I've been to the Biesbosch.
I can't come along.
To kill an old man...
Oh yes.
You drink too much.
You're taking a cure here.
"That's a drag, ok."
But it's no excuse.
"You're not too sick to shoot, are you?"
It's your own old gun.
Works fine.
-Does it?
You're right.
"If we don't do it, who will?"
"They're walking around freely, everywhere."
"In Spain, South America, Germany."
And here.
-Exactly.
We have to settle this before we die.
I'm in.
-I expected nothing less.
Can I?
-I'll wait outside.
"Dr. Weinberg, come see Mr Haverman."
He shot himself through the head.
Where's his visitor?
-Visitor?
Sir!
Weren't you just with Mr Haverman?
"Yes, he asked me to wait outside."
What was that sound?
Come with me?
"Hey, you there!"
"Look here, governor."
- Steady!
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
- Police!
"Chase him, somebody!"
Get a copper!
Police!
Hurry.
"Come on, open up!"
Let me in.
I'm a friend of Dr. Jekyll's.
- Dr. Jekyll's not home.
- He told me to wait.
- I know all Dr. Jekyll's friends.
- Let me in!
- You'll have to come back.
"- Let me in, or I'll bash this door..."
"If you don't go away, I'll have to send for the police!"
That's him!
There he goes!
- This ain't no place to rob.
- But robbed it is!
Help!
Police!
"- Good night, Charles."
- Good night.
- Sorry your young man was detained.
"- So am I, Uncle Geoffrey."
"Good evening, sir."
"There was a ring at the door a while ago, sir."
"When I answered it, there was nobody there."
It's really coming along.
And cute too.
Give it a try.
"Testing, testing."
Hello.
"Argh, I don't believe it."
Tanya's got me detentioned for running in the hall.
"But school's out, everyone's running."
Argh!
Hmm.
Hmm...
"Looks like the dogs took you for a good walk, Mia."
"They're a handful, all right."
Kool Klip alert.
Everyone stay calm.
"Guys, guys, guys-"
Guess who's coming to Heartlake City.
It's...
It's...
Livi.
So gorgeous.
- So fashionable.
- So famous.
Wait.
Wouldn't it be great if she heard one of our songs?
Like that's gonna happen.
"Hey, let's record our new song now."
I've been playing with the lyrics.
"♪ Bring on the lights, set the stage ♪"
♪ In the mood to celebrate ♪
♪ We'll stick together through whatever Hand in hand ♪
♪ Let's live it up ♪
See?
- Which is also ironic.
"You were at a comedy club, and no one was laughing."
Hey shut up all of you!
Well I think I'm gonna take my furry little friend for a walk.
He's been locked in the basement all week.
"You know, why do they call it a ""fur coat"" anyway?"
"It's not made of fur, and it's not a coat."
"Uh, actually Harry, it's both those things."
It was a joke.
Ohh!
Good night everybody.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
Yeah.
"Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick"

You're a donkey!
"I thought you meant ""career"" with a dollar sign."
I think we need more.
"Fireworks, shooting guns."
Maybe we need to get arrested.
"Yeah, that might be a little bit problematic for some of my younger, more impressionable fans."
"I have a lot of those, I'm told."
Hi.
Ashley. (CLICKS TONGUE)
"Oh, my God."
Hi.

You guys know each other.
"Yeah, we fucking live together."
(CLICKS TONGUE) Nice.
"How you take a punch, Josh?"

For the article.

"Come, Erik."
Let's dance.

-My little one!
-I'll talk to him.
-Let me try.
"Hey, little one!"
Are you okay?
Do not you join the dance?
Do not.
-Can you say why?
-Why?
"No, no!"
What I say is ...
"Uncle Mano, I think he wants to know why dance."
"As if he needed one reason it is not, Erik?"
Yes.
There are many more reasons to dance.
What is my father?
The only way to is trying to figure out.
"Come on, son!"
Just one foot after another.
Nobody will laugh I promise you.
"Come on, climb on my feet."
I do not care with what people say
You'll get the hang.
Just need to feel the rhythm.
We are part Emperor of the Nation
"Come on, son!"
Let's shake this world!
- I hardly think so.
- Oh.
Let me introduce myself.
"My name is Mayley, Lord Mayley, and this is Miss Right."
"Oh, congratulations!"
"No, no."
That's her name.
Her name?
"Oh, how do you do?"
Yes...
Would you care for a glass of sherry while you wait?
"Yes, please."
"Er, has Mrs Ransom been a widow very long?"
"Oh, yes."
Many years.
Yes.
"Many, many, years."
Her poor husband died out east in rather mysterious circumstances.
- Oh?
- Yes.
"Drowned, poor fellow."
- Oh!
- Flora was in England at the time.
Oh.
- (Doorbell)
- Ah!
That may be she.
She's... (Chuckles) She's apt to forget her keys.
Let me do the talking.
"Good morning, sir."
Mrs Ransom?
"She's out but we expect her back, if you'd care to come in."
"Talk to the hand, 'cause, er... nobody round here's arsed."
Who rattled your face?
"I'm thinking of calling my mix the ""On The Bathroom Floor"" mix or maybe the ""He Shouts His Own Name When He Comes"" mix."
What are you gobbing on about?
Have you had your brain clamped and towed away?
- (PHONE RINGS)
"- Get that, our kid."
- I don't get calls.
- Further your people skills!
Yeah.
"Oh, right, hang on."
It's for you.
"- Troy, it's for you!"
- It can't be.
- It is.
It's for you!
- I don't get calls.
"Well, you're getting this one."
It's Donna.
Your wife.
Oh.
"Hiya, Donna."
- How's the wife?
- She wants me to move back in with her.
Oh.
"- D'you fancy it, or?"
- Aye.
Suppose.
- Best pack me bag.
- Yeah.
Suppose you best had.
Yes!
Because...
I'm having an asthma attack... from the stress !
"Oh, my..."
"Oh, my God."
Do you have an inhaler ?
Or like an Epi pen ?
I could stab you.
Maybe... we could just...
"sing ""Night Moves"" ?"
I think it might calm me.
Really ?
Please.
Uh.. uh... uh...

"I'll see to it, sir."
Your ticket to Virginia.
I remember when that was you guys.
Brand new.
Excited.
Scared.
And then half of you don't come back.
And we lie to your families about why.
Tibor.
Charlie.
René...
I'm glad you'll be going somewhere safe.
"I'm not great at goodbyes, so..."
Safe.
Sitting at a desk.
Moving little pieces across a board game.
Tom...
There's something I need to tell you.
"You're going back, aren't you?"
Yeah.
"Klaus, we're gonna move you back to Bowmanville."
And I wanted to apologize.
And I think you know what I want from you.
I think you know very well.
Hello?
It's me.
"Claire, hello."
"Yeah, I'm here."
Is Tracey there?
"Yeah, sure."
You want to talk to her?
She called me today.
She wanted me to call back.
"I know, she told me."
"Um, Tracey's asleep."
She's in bed.
Already?
Is she okay?
What's wrong?
She waited for you to call all day.
She's drawing things I don't understand and waking up at night.
"No, she's not okay."
Is there anything I can do?
"Let's talk about this another time, okay?"
I'll tell her you called.
Okay.
Nathan.
Nathan!
Nathan.
"Listen, I came to apologize for this morning."
I was a little heavy-handed and I wanted to apologize.
I have something to show you not far from here.
"Nathan, wait."
Listen.
"Do-wat, do-wat, do-wat"
I'm goin'!
Ooh.
I'm goin'!
"Hey, you guys... what do you say I propose a toast?"
Come on.
Oh... go away.
"Say it quick, before it stops fizzing."
"Shake it up, take a sip, and wish for what you want most in the world."
Okay.
I want to replicate my own DNA and win the Nobel Peace Prize.
Yeah.
Oh!
"Very good, Janie."
"Okay, shake it up, Sport."
Shake it up.
"I want to play more baseball games than Cal Ripkin, Jr."
"Oh, yeah!"
And get filthy rich doing it.
"Oh, yeah!"
"Shake it, Harriet."
I want to see the whole world and I want to write down everything.
"Harriet, slow down."
That's very impressive.
Harriet?
I'm goin'!
"That's good, Harriet."
"That's very pretty, isn't it, Janie?"
"Yes, I like it."
Got you!
"Hey, wait up."
"Everybody, hello!"
"Yeah, we completely believe that you eat cheeseburgers all the time."
Look at me!
I'm taking a bite!
That's my food.
- Mmm!
So good.
- Okay.
"So, um, are you guys gonna be home or away for Thanksgiving?"
Home.
Allen is gonna be in the city with the boys and his ex-wife.
They still do holidays and vacations together.
"- Don't you go, too?"
- Mnh-mnh.
His ex-wife hates me.
- Mm.
- Hates me.
Hates me.
She thinks I stole her husband.
Which I kind of did.
But not on purpose.
"You realize that's not a good story to tell people, right?"
I know!
"So, I'm gonna be all alone."
- Mm.
- By myself.
- Yeah.
- On Thanksgiving.
This coming Thursday.
"Well, enjoy the peace and quiet."
I will!
Okay!
- Bye!
Yeah.
Seriously you think you can.
But it's impossible.
You have another 50%.
I've been waiting for this job.
I don't want it to go to someone else.
Do you want me to beg?
"Je, please just this one time."
Tomorrow I will send the rest.
"When you talk like this, what do you expect?"
Let's go Suchart.
This medicine may make you sleepy.
Bring it on bedtime pill!
I'm not afraid of you.
"Kai, let's play badminton."
Huh?
Badminton.
What?
Hurry.
Alright.
Don't hit it left and right like that.
I'm tired.
What's with all this technique!
Gosh!
I'm so beyond this bedtime pill.
December.
Number 190.
Number 190.
Number 190.
Next number 191.
"Je, I sent it."
I really hate you sometimes.
Come here.
And... you're married.
I know.
"I keep looking down at my hand like, ""What the hell?"""
"And, um... you're living in a big house out in Gladwynne now?"
It's crazy.
It's got nine bathrooms.
Really?
Does he have a problem?
"No, that's just how big the house is."
Oh.
Gotcha.
"So, where are you living now?"
I'm still in Narberth.
"- Oh, where?"
"- Oh, uh..."
Montgomery Street.
Doesn't your mom live...
Oh.
Yeah.
People are kind of afraid to come in here and get their coats.
So...
I volunteered.
"Yeah, coats."
Sure.
She gave me back my grandmother's ring.
Sorry.
Everything was so right.
"I mean, did I tell you our birthdays are one day apart?"
"Yeah, yeah, but I gotta say-a"
My birthday is the same day as that Son of Sam guy.
It's not really enough to build a relationship on.

"I'm sorry, I..."
"Oh, what is going on here?"
Will somebody get the security guards?
"I can't tell you how sorry I am, sir..."
"Would you mind very much, sir for making this disturbance."
I really can't tell you.
My name is Columbo.
I'm from the police.
We're ready when you are.

- I must have dropped mine.
What kinda ticket did you have?
He's in the brown Lincoln.
Foreign plates.
He's walking towards Front Street.
Gothim.
Angie's parked overhere in the LTD.
Cute.
You stay with her.
We're gonna sit on the Lincoln.
"The car's dirty, Cloudy."
We're gonna sit here all night ifwe have to.
What time is it?
Ten after four.

That's the third time those guys have been around.
"All right, let's hit 'em."
Hit 'em!
Freeze!
Nobody move!
Put your hands in the air!
Stay right there.
"Ifyou move, I'll blow your fuckin' head off."
- What the hell's that?
- What are you doin'?
Turn around.
Who's the boss here?
Who's runnin' this outfit?
You are?
What are you doin' here?
"Hear me, Jesse?"
You've done that to me before.
I couldn't think of anything else.
You were always lighting fires.
What fires?
Fires.
-What fires?
What fires are you talking about?
I don't remember any fires.
Get up!
Get up!
"We'll be fine, as long as we forget the past."
Deal?
-Deal.
Forget the past.
-Forget the past.
Here you are...
"Thanks, Marjukka."
Is Jesse still here?
"He's in there, brooding."
Jesse is a fine man.
He thinks a lot.
I think he's really deep.
"Hello, Jesse."
Marjukka!
You gave me this lighter.
It's out of gas and useless now.
I came here to see you - and it's your fault I always ended up in the garbage can as a kid.
Mrs. Hakkarainen!
-Don't...
I dumped him.
Guess why?
"Nothing, nothing."
I finish seeing the analyses.
-The analyses?
-Yes.
-You are hiding something to Me.
"-No, Calm no."
I do not want to die.
"Calm down, calm down."
"It must have an error, surely."
"help me, help me."
"Yes, but you must calm, you do not have to be altered."
"I only feel, I need much affection."
But...!
Mr. Santarelli!
I am much scared.
Why have you done that?
I do not understand...
-Call me Sandro.
"-Yes, yes, as you want."
Thanks.
Sandro...
I must return to the work.
Damn it is...
-Lella.?
I take you home?
-No.
Thanks.
-You are angry with me?
"-No, what goes."
"Well, it raises, I take to house."
I do not go to house.
I am going to make practices to a house of a friend.
It's only Chinese tea!
Chinese tea is still tea.
There're great Chinese tea!
"Mr. Lin, do I need to call security?"
"No need, David."
Mr. Mak...
Shut up!
I'm a member here.
Of course you are.
"Otherwise, our security would be here."
Fight with me if you've balls.
"I can't stop you guys, just be careful."
Help yourselves.
Other women love your money.
"Only Lisa loves you, right?"
I can't watch this.
Please look after them.
Bye.
There's a Lo Keung looking for Mr. Lin.
Pass it to me.
"I'm sorry, Mr. Lin."
Mr. Lo Keung called.
He has something important to tell you.
His number and address are here.
Can you swim?
Bye.
Thanks.
Goodbye.
Why?
Are you scared?
"Excuse me, Mr. Mak."
You want to wear your jacket now or after you dry yourself?

But they said stay put.
"For the blotting-out-the-sun mission, not this."
"Wait, are--?"
Are you going to Cadmus?
"Because if you're going, I'm going."
Just like that?

As the moisture flowed into droplets...
- Slaving away again?

What are you doing?
Surprise.
I moved out of my apartment.
- You agreed.
- I told you.
I had to talk to Laura first.
It's her house.
- But there's so much space here.
- Yeah...
But you're not very easy on her.
- What do you mean?
- You know.
"You don't like Laura, and you don't try to hide it."
That's mutual.
Exactly.
"A great basis, huh?"
Shit.
- You aren't pleased.
"- Yes, I am."
"Yes, I am."
Really.
"I'll talk to Laura later, OK?"
He and his men are the front line.
He's in charge of this.
Whether you like it or not.
"Igor here, they're coming out."
- Headed for the cars.
- Gotcha.
"Big Luc here, they're coming out."
Two black SUV's and a Mercedes.
Standby.

And the rest?
- I only see Boulanger.
- The SUV's are off.
They're taking off.
The SUV's are leaving.
Very slowly.
I see them.
They just passed us.
Let 'em leave the area.
Guy and Bernie tail the SUV's.
"We tail Horn, Boulanger, the chick."
We only hit 'em at the warehouse.
I repeat: don't hit 'em here!
The SUV's are stopped at the entrance.
- Horn and the chick are out.
- We'll be OK.
Armed to the teeth.
Where's he going?
Eve to Dennis.
What's up?
What are the orders?
- My kind of guy.
"- You are such an unfaithful, characterless woman..."
- Me?
Him?
"Dude, I swear."
Thank you so much.
What would have happened if you hadn't showed up.
"Sorry, sorry."
Shiv.
Nice to meet you.
It feels as if we go way back.
Me?
"No, people generally feel so."
But it isn't so.
"So, why are you being so intense?"
"Okay, we are childhood buddies."
Happy?
We are childhood buddies.
Happy?
Okay?
Sorted?
- Oh.
- Thanks.
- Aww.

Cheers.

I'm in Colorado.
Wow.
"Hey, so I'm here for a few days."
"Any tips or things or ideas, uh, stuff I might do for fun?"
Uh... yeah.
"Actually, you can do some cool mountain biking while you out there."
"But Mom, while you're there, do not do any MDMA."
Okay?
- MDMA?

That sounds terrible.
"- Yeah, it was."
- Yeah.
Must be very sunny to have to wear those sunglasses where you are.
"Oh, these?"
"Nah, it's just that, you know, a long night last night."

"- I'm here, baby."
- Okay.
Okay.
Bo.
Stay back!
What's going on?
What the hell just happened?
I guess some people don't deal well with rejection.
Thought I'd be extra crispy for sure.
As if I could get rid of you that easily.
"Hey, Bo."
"I'm not like Jenny, am I?"
I'm not too clingy or anything?
You make me want to be a better Fae.
Go seduce a yak.
My God.
Mass destruction and two dead Furies.

Aw look at that honey.
You've already forgot about Jesse.
[Crying] Jesse.
Aw I'm sorry.
I just meant...
[Grunting] Zip it!
Look nothing personal but sometimes you just...
Have a tendency to be a big dumb daddy?
I would never say that because you let me live here.
"But because you said it, oh yeah!"
Now look Miley.
Jesse... that guy your dad just mentioned.
Is your past and these letters are your future.
I guess you're right.
Of course I'm right!

The president.
He shot him!
He shot him in there.
"Look, I need you to listen to me."
"There's an air strike coming, I need you to run."
I need you to run as far and as fast as you can possibly go.
Can you do that?
I gotta get the president.
Okay.
You gotta go for me.
"Now, go."
Hundreds of people seem to be running toward the White House.
"They've been told to evacuate too, but they're climbing the fence."
"Okay, we have confirmation."
Where did he go?
You want to wear it now or later?
Go to hell!
"Sir, be careful."
Slippery floors.

Dropping the hellfire.
Yankee... that's all?
Yes.
"It's a GUNK, isn't it?"
Everyone listen!
Gimlet here.
The bombing failed.
The enemy is getting closer.
As shown on the screen it's a self-supported tank.
"But, we will proceed as in practice."
I will move to position too.
"Male, until then, be the look out."
Male here.
Understood.
I should be able to see it.
It's coming!
Marking it with the laser.

All green.
Let's start.

Tell me you're gonna be strong.
I'm trying.
You can do this.
I know you can.
You're brave.
Braver than anyone.
"I'm not brave, Mom."
I pretend that I am.
And I want people to think that I am.
But I'm not.
"I'm really, really scared."
That maybe we are actually what's wrong in this world.
Divergents.
I never wanted any of this.
You and Dad and Caleb and then Four.
And I can't help but think that if I was normal we would all still be together.
"Mom, I don't wanna be Divergent anymore."
I just wanna feel safe again.

"Oh, good."
So who's there?
Are you still fooling around with Albert?
No.
- A new lover?
- No.
And my other tenant?
Is he seeing someone too?
I bet you're building a little love nest.
"I mean, separately."
"No, I don't think he's seeing anyone at the moment."
I just really miss that bastard.
- Johan?
"- No, for Christ's sake!"
Hello.
You're gonna be okay.
Just gotta get a little bit of power into you.
"Ladies, could you give us a bit of space, please?"
Thank you.
"You're a big deal, you know?"
You're not the only one wronged by Akan.
You and I both want the same thing.
This may hurt a bit.
(MECHANICAL WHIRRING)
There we go.

Someone gave you a third chance.

"Frank, all I'm asking, as a colleague, as a friend..."
And it's still no.

Think so.
I hope so.

"The poison is still fresh, three days."
They're following us.
"If they knew we were here, they would've killed us already."
This is it.
This is where Forrestal cashed in.
A friend of yours?
A competitor.
He was good.
"He was very, very good."

"Throw me the idol, I throw you the whip."
"Of course, my son."
Congratulations my dear!
"Dad, you really have a good taste."
Another one?
"Well Dad, I really want me and Joy to be just like you."
It was so sudden.
"Just come home, please?"
"You're his first love, you know."
He only met that Joy because you left for Canada.
"Please Bela, just come home please?"
.
I really don't want Joy to be my sister-in-law!
She's not on the same level with my brother.
"Come on Ara, you've already pre-judged the person."
But it's true!
"I'm right, am I not?"
Right?
I'll just get back at you.

I knew you'd be there.

They arrested an innocent man?
Laughter.
* You can not tell you.
How can I do myself?
I find that?
"* Fend for you, miss."
The phone rings.
...
* You are very Melanie at Lupin.
Speak after the beep.
Bip.
"* Melanie, it was Jonathan."
I know where you're not.
ll have much time.
Remember me.
Kisses.
A knock.
...
You thought I would let you do that?
You see?
You wanted to screw up my marriage but yours takes off.
"That is good, the informers."
With what I told the cops Mamadou tone must be on the plane.
The airport!
Bitch!
"It is where, his fund puts forth?"
Damn ...
"So that, it goes there."
The engine.
Oh no.
Starts!
Starts!
- Am I?
- You know you are.
"- Yeah, I suppose I am."
What about you?
I'm from Morpeth.
(KEY IN LOCK)
Here's Moz.
Fancy going into town?
- I'm going into town.
D'you want some fags?
- I've got some now.
I've been ringing round everywhere.
Not a blade of grass in town.
"- Good job your mate with the gear's here, then."
- Eh?
See ya.
When?
"Oh, it's you."
"- Ahoy, Captain!"
- What's that supposed to mean?
Nowt.
Goodbye.
(FARTS)
(FARTS)
What are you doin' here?
You threw a tin of dressed crab through my window.
I didn't mean owt by it.
Just trying to get your attention.
You've got it now.
"You're off, pal, you're not needed."
I've bought some wicked gear.
You can have a little bit of it if you want.
- Sports cars.
Mm.
- Yeah.
Now that you got me here what are you gonna do with me?
I'm going to...
Going to do this.
- Mom
- Damon?
"Oh, my God."
Matt.
"Oh, my God."
- I gotta...
"- It's fine, just go."
I'll take her home.
"Thanks, man."
- Where have you been?
"- Um, I needed some air."
For three hours?
"Tell me, where have you been?"
Out.
I was out.
"Annabelle, don't do this."
I can't fight you too.
What?
I'm sorry.
- Sorry I'm bailing.
- Just wish you'd let me drive you home.
Normal people don't have chaperones or bodyguards or babysitters.
"- We're normal tonight, remember?"
"- I know, I get so worried about you."
"Stefan, I can't live every minute afraid that someone's gonna come after me."
I won't.
"- Hi, I'm Mackie."
- Danny Mitchell.
Danny used to work in the D.A.'s office.
You look good.
You still on patrol?
"No, actually, today is the first day of my new job-- I made detective."
Congratulations.
Which department?
Internal Affairs.
Wow!
Bet your family loved that.
"Oh, no, she hasn't told them yet."
Oh...
Okay.
Good luck with that.
I should get going.
- It's really great seeing you.
- You too.
"Maybe we could grab lunch, catch up."
"Yeah, sure."
Sounds great.
"Here, call me with a time."
Call me if you need a lawyer.
Thanks.
All right.
He is so cute.
What is the story with you guys?
We're just friends.
The guy was totally into you.
"No, he wasn't."
- Do you mind if I call him?
- No.
It's hot!
Bad idea!
Bad idea!
- Put me down!
- Okay.
Thank you.
Okay.
Nobody panic.
We're only in here for two hours.
Four hours.
Four hours!
"""Four hours...!"""
"Oh, my God."
"You know, if you ever want to get serious about wine, you really have to lose the mustache."
"True, 'cause it gets all caught up in there."
Mm-hmm.
That makes sense.
- Yeah.
Pee-ew!
Be a lot easier if you just shaved it.
"I'd rather not, Rick."
I'm not shaving it.
I didn't bring shaving equipment.
"Bobby, quit being a pinot grouchio!"
"Look, I'm perfectly happy enjoying my wine, staring out the window at that... kid on a bike, going the same speed as us?"
And we are friends.
I call him Ramon.
"Hi, Ramon!"
What?
Hi!
I can't hear you.
What?
Paris.
Champs Elysees.
Gracefully.
Okay.
"And now, walk as if a string is pulling you from the crown of your head."
Walk as if you're hanging in midair.
"I said string, not rope."
"Yes, keep walking, good."
Shoulders down and turn around.
And...
Other side.
Walk with your foot in the air and...
Keep going.
It went really well today.
Good.
We did two more scenes.
Great.
I thought you'd come back.
You're mad at me.
Why?
You should move out.
You're paying rent for nothing.
"I'm going away, Dad."
Where to?
For how long?
I don't know.
Overseas is good.
You think so?
Yes.
I think your mother would be very proud of you.
"Good night, Gonki."
"Good night, Daddy."
You've... already ruined me.
Exactly what do you want?
Your life.
Back then...
I had no choice.
You're saying you had no choice back then?
You don't have a choice now either...
you have to die.
No!
No!
NO!
Don't come.
Don't come.
Don't come.
Don't come.
Don't come.

It was asserted that the North needed to be punished.

So for my sister.
"Mike, slow down a bit."
Listen.
Nursery with me after 20 minutes I want to buluşmanı.
Did you hear that?
I'm going there.
OK.
"I trusted you, Mike."
I got through.
Take a look at how the response has given me.
"- There is a way, I'm sure."
"- This is officially bullshit, Mike."
"- Sculpture, where, Mike?"
- $ 1 million.
Leave me and my brother.
This Agreement.
"Agreements you will not you, Mike."
I'll do it.
"The best thing you can do, is to save his brother."
"He is now the location of the statue say, let live."
"- If you do not, it dies."
I can assure you.
- Then you do 2 million.
"Damn where is sculpture, Mike?"
Get up!
I.ne you stand up!
"I i.ne damn, come on!"
"Come on, Mikey!"
Stand up!
Come on!
"- Fuck, man!"
There's gotta be another way outta here.
Buzz?
Was that you?
"Hey, hi there, little fella."
Come out here.
Do you know a way outta here?
Buzz!
They're cannibals.
"Mayday, mayday."
"Come in, Star Command."
Send reinforcements.
"Star Command, do you copy?"
I've set my laser from stun to kill.
Great.
Great.
"Yeah, and if anyone attacks us, we can blink 'em to death."
"Hey, you guys, I think I found him!"
"Buzz, is that you?"
"Whiskers, will you get outta here!"
You're interfering with the search and rescue!
"Look, they're home."
"Mom, have you seen Woody?"
Where was the last place you left him?
Right here in the van.
"Oh, I'm sure he's there."
You're just not looking hard enough.
"He's not here, Mom."
Woody's gone.
Woody's gone?
"Yeah, boy, the weasel ran away."
Huh?
Huh?
"- A federale, right in front of him."
"Three agents wounded, one lost his leg."
It's like what you hear about in Iraq or something.
- The IEDs.
- Jesus.
I had to hear about it from Steve Gomez.
Hank talked to his SAC for about an hour.
Hank should win an Oscar.
He's so damn breezy with the man.
"He hangs up the phone, goes right back to bed."
"And all he keeps saying is,"
"""I'm fine."
I'm fine.
"Leave me alone""."
"Baby, not now."
"It's me, Hank."
Sorry.
"Hey, buddy."
What's up?
I just...
Do you mind if I...?
"No, no."
So...
How you doing?
You know.
Lousy.
"Montezuma's Revenge, big time."
"I mean, everything's going through me like crap through a tin horn."
Better not get too close.
I'll take my chances.
I guess you heard about what happened down in Juárez?
Terrible.
Mm.
See?
That was easy.
It's like I always say.
"When it comes to good parenting, you have to be fair but firm."
"You just show him that you mean business, and he's out of bed again, isn't he?"
You never have this problem with sock puppets.
Aah!
Oh!
All right.
What's this all about?
Voices.
- Voices?
- Uh-huh!
In here!
Telling me what to do!
You have voices inside your head.
Sometimes.
And what kind of things do they tell you to do?
Oh!
Oh...
The early bird catches the worm!
What's gotten into this kid?
Hey...
Ow!
Hey!
Maybe you sing him a little song.
"Come here, y..."

Stay with me.
I'm plugging.
We got it!
You got it?
I'm charging!
Yes!

- Great!
- How many amps is that?

"A couple days, you should be fine."
We could do this as a service for people...
Rut and Adam's electro refueling.
I knew it would work!
"You're a man of science, Rutledge Wood."
This is genius!
"Well, it's something."
It only takes a truck getting 17 miles a gallon for an electric car to charge.
You're saving the earth.
One charge at a time.
Excellent.
Let's go.
"Yes, of course."
There.
Set it up and push it.
Never take this off.
Let me know when it rings.
You know why I gave you this important thing?
Yeah.
I don't trust the others.
Try not to touch it.
"Dad, have a look here."
Is everyone here?
Have a look.
Champagne?
We need this for such a great day like today.
And I've prepared one more thing.
Want to see?
What's he doing now?
He makes me so nervous.
Don't be surprised.
Congratulations on being human!
Congratulations on being human!
Who's that?
"Wait, that's..."
Hurry and escape.
- What are you doing?
- Be quiet.
Just do what I say.
Now go!
Where the hell are we going?
"Mr. Hong, where've you been?"
Stay there.
It's most embarrassing.
I'll come and see you tomorrow...
I can't.
I've got a board meeting and a charity dance.
I'll come the day after tomorrow.
"Until then, expose nothing."
"- Where do you live, by the way?"
"- 54, Chillingdon Court."
You know it?
"Yes, I used to have..."
Day after tomorrow.
- Ah-ah.
This way.

"Sir, you had given us rupees five lakh as advance."
And we have kept ready your goods worth 80 lakh!

You're all right.

You're ready.

Are you the parents of the little boy in the tunnel?
How does it feel to know that Mercy was three minutes--?
Excuse me.

Ugh.

Oh.
"Oh, you know it's not my thing."
I told you to water the plants.
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
What is she doing?
- Oh!
"- Oh, what a mess."
- I'm coming in!
"- Jess, take your shoes off!"
We keep an Asian household.
Didn't see that coming.
- What are you doing?
Seong-bok.
I think it's the owner.
Seong-bok?
Excuse me.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
What's the matter with you?
Did you get bit?
Huh?
"Say something, dammit."
He's the criminal.
"You're scaring me, man."
Snap out of it.
It wasn't just one or two people.
He took pictures of them when they were alive- and then went back for more when they went crazy and died.
What the hell are you going on about?
He's the criminal.
That's enough.
I'll deal with you later.
I'm sure of it.
He...
He took his victims' belongings and did something with them.
What did you see?
Tell me!

Come on.
All right.
Ask me a question.
Come on.
Ask me a tough one.
Let's go.
Stay with me.
There's some cyanosis in his fingers.
- Heart rate...
- 185.
I've gotta tube him.
Scope!
"- I'm here, what's up?"
- Sudden acute respiratory distress.
Looks like trauma to the neck.
Obstructed airway.
- Kid's circling the drain.
- I need the endoscope.
- What?
Why?
"- This temp airway the cops put in,"
I can't take it out.
I gotta intubate through it.
Damn it!
- What's yours for?
- I can't...
No landmarks.
- O2 sats down to 88.
"- Hurry, Jerry!"
- There's too much swelling!
- We don't have time.
"OK, hold on, I think I got it."
ET tube.
- OK great.
Let's get ready...
"- No, sorry."
It's totally closed.
- Heart rate up to 190.
- He needs an airway now.
"Yeah, that's great, yeah."
(moaning)
Mr. Cheng?
Mr. Cheng?
"Mr. Cheng, what troubles you?"
Nothing.
"If nothing, why are you out here alone?"
I'm resting.
"I can't see, but I can listen."
"You never say much, or even laugh."
Right.
I am troubled.
Everyone has some worry.
"You mean, you have troubles?"
Naturally.
Mother's dead.
"I just have an aunt, she is kind, but that's all."
"Actually, you should worry about your eyes."
It's no use.
"Oh, no."
"If you go to the city, find a foreign doctor, maybe you'll see again."
(gasps) Really?
It's the only chance.
Sure.
But where do I find the money?
"Don't worry, when I'm finished here, I'll take you."
Thank you!
"Mr. Cheng, thank you."
[Aunt] Xiao-Mei!
Yes?
[Aunt] The sheriff is leaving.
I'm coming.
The clinic called.
They said my ass was a perfect match for your hand.
They can start the skin grafts next week.
"Reese, what do you think you're doing?"
-What?
He loves the stuff.
He goes through three or four cans a day.
I don't know how he does it.
Half a can makes me nuts.
Based on true events
"- Well done, Casper."
- Let me have a go.
- Happy with the flat?
"- Yes, two floors."
I love it.
"One floor is Mia's, the other is mine."
"- Splash, Frank!"
The champ.
- I'm off.
- Where to?
- Some sort of lunch at the Gimp's.
- No change in Bodil?
"- No, she's a wreck."
- What's wrong with Bodil?
- She's suffered brain damage.
- Up here?
"- In the brain, yes."
Surprise.
- How did it happen?
- She choked on a giant olive.
- This big.
Have you seen a... wet boy running around here?
He's lost.
And he's truly in a lot of trouble.
"We have witnessed no moist children of the masculine variety gallivanting within these halls, no."
"Oh, hey, Poll."
How's it going?
Oh...
"Hi, Matt."
"You, er, you thought about what I asked you?"
"Yes, actually, I have..."
And?
"All right, you can shag me."
But only once.
You're lucky Bruce is in Guatemala.
Fine.
I'll be around later.
"Can't allow our friends to be naked alone, Matthew."
It's just not cricket.
Got ya...
They're beautiful.
"Oh, thanks."
I do them myself.
Do you?
Yeah.
So you could do me... now?
Sure... if you're up for it.
Does it hurt?
Beautifully.
What are you getting?
A mark...
Passion...
Want...
I don't know.
I just thought.
"Well, you didn't think so good."
How do you know?
Because Burke and I are just friends.
Ok?
Really.
Ok.
You ready for sleep?
Good night.
"Good night, honey."
"Jukebox: ¶ lord, I was born a ramblin' man ¶"

"it's my mother, tom."
She's alone.
I never should have left her.
"At least in New York, I'd be near."
I'd be close to her.
"I could see about a transfer, Damien."
"I need reassignment, tom."
I want out of this job.
It's wrong.
It's no good.
You're the best we've got.
Am I really?
"It's more than psychiatry, and you know that, tom."
"Some of their problems come down to faith-- their vocation, the meaning of their lives, and I can't cut it anymore."
I need out.
I'm unfit.
"I think I've lost my faith, tom."
Hello?
"Yes, this is Mrs. MacNeil."
You're married!
There's always something dragging you back.
What was he after?
Nothing.
You don't know him?
No.
Good.
And thanks for doing the riding hat.
Get me out of bother.
Who have you spotted now?
Mr Tubby.
"Aw, he's walking away all sad."
Will you not just have a butty with him?
No!
Yoo-hoo!
Tubby!
She's changed her mind.
She will have lunch with you - next Monday in the square.
Bring a yoghurt!
Sorry!

He's lovely...!

"Hey, you really saved us from getting wiped out."
"Why, King Triton!"
[Chuckles] How are you?
- Let her go!
- Not a chance!
She's mine now!
- We made a deal.
"- Daddy, I'm sorry!"
I-I...
I didn't mean to!
I didn't know!
[Ursula laughs]
You see?
"The contract's legal, binding and completely unbreakable, even for you."
"Of course, I always was a girl with an eye for a bargain."
The daughter of the great sea king is a very precious commodity.
But I might be willing to make an exchange for someone even better.
"Eric, what are you doing?"
"Grim, I lost her once."
I'm not gonna lose her again!
"Now, do we have a deal?"
Ha!
It's done then!

- No!
"Oh, no!"
Your Majesty.
Daddy.
- At last... it's mine.
- No.

- You!
You monster!
When did I?

You gave it to Jai.
And Jai...
I get it.
It's between us.
Why drag Jaiprakash into this?
"All right, Hari..."
what's wrong?
Your touch has awoken the music in me!
That's the background score.
Who was playing it?
It happens in emotional scenes.
Was it the radio?
I've got to give you some news.
"Your husband is dead, isn't he?"
But don't worry...
"I'm willing to marry a ""window""!"
Window?
Aren't you a window now?
!
It's Widow; not window.
Never mind!
But we will still meet!
No.
We will not.
Two gardeners and a rose.
What?
!
Don't look back.
But that man there...
The chap with the blue shorts?
"Allison, if you get hurt while I'm busy with some stupid test, someone's going to need to take care of me."
-lf he does anything...
-Like?
Anything weird or bizarre...
Anything.
Anything evil!

Jackson?
Did you still want to discuss your paper?
"You have one hour, Mr. McCall."
Begin.
(sighs)
(SCOFFS)
"Really, Scott?"
I can't.
(sighs) I gotta do this.
I gotta do this.
"No, I am gonna go to work."
I am gonna go to work.
I am just gonna straighten up.
Just a little bit.
Just a tad.
He won't even know I was here.
(MELLOW ROCK SONG playing)
(TlCKlNG)
You just scared the hell out of me.
"Sorry, I..."
"I was just, I was..."
Nothing.
That's a...
Nice heels.
"Yeah, my feet were hurting, so I..."
My God!
Now look... hear me out!
"Yawning like a princess, eh?"
Aren't you ashamed?
What is this?
A finger.
What else?
Acting smart!
Here goes...
That's one finger.
How many are these?
Two.
And how many are these?
Your finger is swollen!
Naturally!
I gave you a blow!
But I won't spare you...
Why are awakening me only to hit me?
Will you realise it if you're bashed up unconscious?
That explains it!
No!
Call the police!
You're an ill-mannered man!
No!
What are you up to?
!
The poor man will die!
He teases women in our area!
What nonsense?
!
I'm glad you've come!
Save me from this bear!
Look at my face!
- What's it called?
"- Oh, God."
Perspirex.
"Hello, it's Marco."
Remember me?
Of course.
- How are you?
- Naked.
I should buy some clothes.
This is all I have.
I could go to your house and get what you need.
"No, I don't want anything from there."
Maybe later.
- Where are we going?
- To Sybilla.
- You must think I'm mad.
- Why?
- I don't ever want to go back home.
"- No, I understand."
"When we broke up,"
I couldn't carry on sleeping in the same bed.
- I slept on the couch.
- Yeah?
"I did that for over a week, until I decided to buy a new bed."
So you're single.
I'm alone.
SEVERAL MONTHS LATER
We have to talk after the fight.
- We've been talking for an hour.
- You.
Not me.
[ Voice breaks ] They kicked me out.
"I ended up going to this mansion party that was, like, a thousand times better all-nighter."
"But still, I didn't get to dance at my prom."
I never knew.
I'm so...

Really?
He was 28?
Come on.
We have a magical night to save.
W-was it your date's mansion?

Ooh!
They may need a hose!
"Hey, Jules, maybe we should hang back."
"You know, like, give the kids some space."
They love us.
We saved prom.
"Also, we're super fun."
I think the kids can sense that.
It's kinda like how dogs can hear loud whistles.

[ Cheering ]
Dance circle.
[ Cheering continues ]
"Uh, no, thanks."
I'm good.
"I'm not really cut out for a dance circle, so..."
"Even if you have 2 guns, how many of us can you shoot?"
"Before we fight, sign the contract first."
You two go!
It was a misunderstanding.
Sorry.
Misunderstanding?
You made me lose face.
Put down your gun.
Fight!
So be it.
You think you can win me?
Come on.
Roll the camera!
Hold this.

Lincoln!
I didn't hit him.
Will he die?
"Chairman, we saw you kill him."
Right...
Perhaps it's your internal strength?

Oh no.
I will take the first flight tomorrow.
Any news in the papers and I leave.
"Go, police is coming."

"Doctor, how is he?"
He is stable.
You can go to see him.
I want to tell you
"I did my best to stop them, Judge Travis."
"Now, I can see that, Litefoot."

"Come on, let's go, boys."
Stand him up.
"No, bring him on this mule."
"Come on, get him up there."
"Come on, get up there."

That's it.
That's right.
You get to go see the Lord.
"All right, get the rope up over there."
Get up there.
All right.

"Glad to see you, boys."
I know who you seven sons of bitches are.
You're not gonna get away with this.

"Oh, thank you, Mary."

Good luck.

This is where we live.
You can see Sweden on a clear day.

A drink?
No thanks.

Cheers.
You have a video that can give me a sense of what goes on there.
It will take more than a video to show you that.
Meaning?
Bombay has over a million child prostitutes.
Four or five times that suffer from malnutrition.
They're not on the video.
Then there are those who die every day of...
Yes.

Why shouldn't he fall in love with her?
He hasn't fallen in love.
He has succumbed to her.
The poor man was simply standing there and was crushed under her wheels.
It's not too late.
"Franz, you must go over at once and talk to him."
Please.
Excellent.
Thank you.

Oh!
Oh!
"Oh, I'm so sorry."
You're sorry.
Oh.
"Well, Gretchen, what happened to you?"
I found Nancy.
"What'd you do, have breakfast with her?"
I think you better not go in there.
Why?
"Well, she's sharing her drawing room with a man."
Nancy?
He was in bed when I walked in.
"Oh, there's some mistake."
"Yes, there's a mistake all right, and Nancy's made it."
"Gretchen, I think you've said about enough."
"Well, I saw him!"
You coming?
No.

Let me go.
Why no answer?
"Addons like breaking the rules, and I ignored the instructions."
Addons I have no choice to start a sentence.
A penalty?
Afraid that ...
Does it look like I care?
I will never play again.
"All my friends Addons Dave, will be selected."

But I didn't mean nobody to get killed.
Quit stalling.
Who paid ya to do it?
Hanley and Grayce.

Yeah.
Then started the car and then jumped out.
"Yeah, I did, but I didn't mean to have nobody get killed."

- Does it matter?
I don't know.
Does it matter to you?
"If it mattered, I'd be with him, and I'm not."

I told my friends about you.
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.
What did you say?
- That you're crazy...
- [Laughs]
And that I'm having a sexual awakening with you.
Wow.
A sexual awakening.
I told them that I've never come so much in my life.
[Laughs]
"Oh, wait a second."
Even more than with Paul?
- Way more than Paul.
- Yeah.
Paul was too big.
I couldn't take it unless I was really drunk.
What's wrong?

We all WANT to be attractive.

Oh!
"Hi, Alex."
How... how are you?

"Oh, good, good."
What's wrong with you?
You don't...
Claire's gone.
Gone?
Yeah.
Gone where?
I came home to surprise her during lunch and I found her in bed with her masseur.
"It's my own fault, really..."
Claire hates surprises.
"Alex, I'm..."
I'm really sorry.
"No, no, I knew it was coming."
I don't know WHY she wasn't happy.
I...
I...
I don't know how I could have loved her any more than I did.
I don't think it would've mattered how much you loved her.
- Rose.
- Uh-huh.
Did you know that Claire was jealous of you.
- What!
Jealous of me?
"- Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yes.."
Hello?

Pick up your shit and get the fuck out of here.
You're fired.
This motherfucker's crazy.
"You lost it, man."
Shit!
Damn it!
Where is it?
Asshole!
What the fuck did you do with it?
Idiot!
Hey!
Fuck you!
Get out!
What?
It's an occupational hazard.
"So, Trevor, are you gonna rescue me from this miserable life or what?"
Dori!
Dori!
"Dori, you're here."
Why is he here?
Do you know this dog?
"Yes, he's Dori."
Somebody abandoned him.
Do you know the owners?
"Yes, I've seen them here before."
They abandoned him?
"Yes, I think so."
I couldn't find the owners.
So my uncle decided to raise him.
Really?
That's terrible.
How could they abandon Dori?
That's his name?
Yes.
"We didn't know, so we named him Ocean."
"Oh, you did?"
"Dori, what's happened to you?"
Will you keep him?
"Yes, my uncle is fond of dogs."
And he's just a little puppy.
That's better for him.
Huh?
It's better than being raised in Seoul.
"Dori, are you alright?"
Do you like it here?
Don't you miss your owner?
Some owners they are for ditching him.
The crazy bastards.
You speak my mind.
Well done.
Come on.
An enquiry.
"- Yes, Sir."
Before 18th of September...
Did this guy stay here?
"No, Sir."
Are you sure?
Or do you want confirm with someone else?
I'm sure.
He is not our guest.
"Panju, this is where I stay."
Please come.
Do you know him?
No.
Take a closer look.
He was staying here.
I'm sure that he didn't stay here.
How are you so sure?
I never forget any guest's face.
I can even remember a guest who stayed with us 10 years ago.
Do you know him?
No.
Give the key for room number 205.
Why?
He is staying here.
Give the key.
We are investigating trusting people like this!
Come.
He was staying here for a while.
What happened to him?
For sure.
Bye.
Drake set it up for Saturday.
Sweet.
Good.
Now I can get some sleep.
What?
man-- that guy has been calling me every night wanting to know when it's gonna happen.
he hit me up like three times today.
He's freaking crazy.
Stop for a minute.
What?
This boy Erin's seeing-- do you know anything about him?
Yeah.
He's-- he's new in town.
He works for Garret.
He's a fighter?
I guess so.
Could you deal with him?
I already have once.
smartass.
Yeah.
Why?
The word's up somebody's trying to book him some big money fights.
I was thinking of bringing some of my friends in.
l want to make sure you can take this guy.
Set it up.
This is it?
What the fuck were you expecting?
It's a private bout.
Come on.
This should be interesting.
"All right, but aren't you the guide?"
Are you ennoyed?
"Not ""ennoyed"", ""annoyed""!"
Annoyed?
"Not yet, but if you carry on, I soon will be."
"Welcome, engineer."
Hello.
- We're honoured.
- The honour's mine.
This is it.
Welcome.
This is one of the rooms.
What did she say?
"If it's too small, there are other rooms."
"Thank you, we'll only be staying a couple of nights."
Make yourself at home.
This is the bathroom.
Another bedroom...
That's good.
Thank you.
- Where's the old lady's house?
- Who?
- The lady who's ill.
- You mean Malek?
"Yes, son."
She lives over there.
You can see it from the roof.
- Which way?
- This way.
- Can we see it from here?
- Yes.
See that blue window?
"I'm telling you, asshole, to get your ass out there!"
For crying out loud...
"Okay, I'll go."
"Come on, hurry!"
Shit.
Who the fuck are you?
What the hell?
"Stop, goddamn it!"
"Stop it, you dirty slut!"
You whore!
"Eat this, too."
"Amn, you're heavy."
I'm getting too old for this.
Don't be ridiculous.
Old ladies tell me men can still get it up after 70.
Then buy me some herbal supplements.
I keep having fucked-up nightmares.
What're you doing in there?
Oh hell.
Shit!
Nothing!
Get away from the car.
- Don't open it!
- What are you doing?
For crying out loud!
Dad!
Dad?
Look.
How do I look?
Pretty.
Freakishly pretty.
How long were you watching?
Meaning what?
Meaning nothing comes out of the mirror unless something goes back in.
Really?
And I am done... with that.
I beg to freaking differ.
Freak.
I suppose I should have destroyed that mirror when I had the chance.
Turn around.
This is on you.
You're the one who set me free.
"Well, I'm fixing that right now."
Turn around.
"Oh, my..."
I am never going back into that mirror.
Do you hear me?
Never.
And this.
This is my ace.
That's it.
Cash me out.
Curiouser and curiouser.
"Artie, now!"
"Pete, help me."
"Artie, where is Myka?"
- Thank you.
"- Yeah, you're welcome."
All right.
"Here, let's get this."
- So what now?
- Now...
Now we move Alice to the dark vault.
- What's the dark vault?
It's just scars.
Chicks dig scars.
I love scars.
Now here we go.
"Oh, wonderful."
You're doing very good.
What?
"What's that, Larry?"
Really?
You want to take our love to the next level?
"Well, I..."
"The setting's a little strange, but..."
"Well, I suppose we wouldn't be the first star-crossed lovers to make love in a crypt."
"Oh Larry, I accept."
Oh-ohhhhh!
Oomph!
"No, not there."
Maybe it's here.
"No, it's never there."
There's no murder weapon anywhere.
"Come on, Marnie, you're looking for a remote control."
Suspicious.
What is?
Just a second Ricky.
Jumbo panties!
Excuse me.
Aahhh!
I've been caught.
What are you doing with my panties?
What should I do?
"S-say you're a panty fiend, sorry."
"Sorry, I'm a panty fiend."
Is he seeing somebody?
- Why are you asking me?
- Just tell me the truth.
"Is he seeing somebody else, Chris?"
Look at me!
I'm looking at you.
I don't know if he's seeing anybody else.
You don't know.
How could you not know?
I don't know anything.
Hey.
This is Michael.
- Leave a message...
- What is with the yelling?
- Where did he go?
- I don't know.
Jenna!
"Michael, call me as soon as you get this message."
I'm gonna kill you.
"Oh, my God!"
What the hell are you doing?
You're calling him?
"- No, that wasn't him."
- To tell him what?
What is this?
- What the fuck is this?
- I honestly have no fucking idea.
"- Yes, you do."
Do you know her?
- Just give me a break.
"- No, I don't."
- Do you know her?
"Thank you, Roko."
"Look at it, a real champion."
- Thank you.
- No problem.
"Come on, folks!"
Come and get it!
"Hello, 13 Ribarska St."
What do you say?
"Out here, all the fish is as big as this one."
"I'd like to ask you something, if I can..."
"No, you can't."
What devil brings you here?
Praise the Lord.
Now and forever.
"It was opened, so I came in for a prayer."
Do you need any help?
"Thank you, my child."
I'm done.
Sister...
I'd like to give a donation to your church... if I may.
You may... of course you may.
We pass this on to the Child Care Centre.
Here.
My child...
Thank you.
On behalf of them.
What brings you here?
"Have you come alone, or..."
I'm alone.
My child...
"If you need anything, just ask."
"Thank you, Sister."
"Because I do not know whether night is a dream, and he hates me, and now he's going to give me to them like he did with the others."
They are going... to sacrifice me to the demons!
- It's all right.
It's all right.
You're just imagining things.
Everything is going to be okay.
- What the devil is going on in here?
!
"- My apologies, ma'am."
This poor girl is clearly suffering from some kind of delusional attack.
- Lucy... you cannot hurt me.
- I can.
I will!
- You can't.
Gunther.
No!
Let go of me.
The wolves!
The wolves!
No!
The wolves...
"- Thank you, sir."
Porter.
- Detective Thomas.
Good to see you.
- How're you doing?
Good to see you.
- I'm good.
I'm good.
"Please, sit."
- Sure.
- How are you?
"Since you have been decided, will you go with me also."
Ah...yes.
We go.
Lets go.
"Yet this traffic, no longer can be crossed."
It is truth.
Slowly...
-Sandro?
you have bound?
"-No, it is that I..."
-What you do?
"We go, we go, lady."
Where you are going to look for them?
In the day-care center?
The very ready one!
You accompanied her to house?
"Eh, boys, Prof. Cicchirini has bought a new car."
-No.
-That yes.
-I do not create it to me.
-If you I to it say.
We are going to let pass this opportunity?
No.
"Boys, a question:"
Which can be the car of Cicchirini?
I believe that it is the one with the canvas.
Bravo!
Right answer.
"-Goodbye, mother."
-Paulino.
Mother.
"I must go to me, we see you behind schedule this?"
"Yes, I'm going to the fields to get my things."
Where's the engineer from?
Tehran or Hamadan?
"Get up, you've slept enough, you layabouts."
"Get up, I've brought fresh apples."
This is for Ali and this one for Keyvan.
- Hello.
"- Hello, are you well?"
I have some fresh bread for you.
- What is it?
- Bread.
We have fresh bread.
What more can you want?
You won't have another chance like this.
This is for me.
The big apple is for uncle Jahan.
How about that!
This isn't Jahan's apple.
I think it's yours.
"Yes, yes, it's coming."
Here.
All right.
- Have you had your share?
- Yes.
Where are you going?
To school.
- To school?
- Yes.
Do you have time to show us the village?
"No, I have exams."
I'll go with you to school.
All right.
John.
I want you to be happy.
What?
"This is your wake-up call, Mr. Klein."
I didn't ask for a wake-up call.
"What happened to you, Mr. Klein?"
Yes.
I can't believe I got through.
"Gordon, where are you, man?"
Speak up.
"Listen, John, he was right."
Mr. Cold was right about everything.
Right?
Right about what?
I can't hear you.
He was right about understanding.
"It's real, John."
I want you to know.
It's real
What is...
What are you talking about?
You've got nothing to worry about.
I'll see you in time.
Gordon?
Gordon!
Can they tell how long he was out there?
Looks like he's been dead about eight hours.
He died of exposure.
What made you come out here?
- He called me.
- When?
I didn't like the way he sounded.
He was good.
"He was very, very good."
"Señor, nobody has come out of there alive..."
Please.
Señor!
Stop.
Stay out of the light.
Forrestal.
Let us hurry.
There is nothing to fear here.
That's what scares me.
Stay here.
If you insist Señor.
Give me the whip.
Throw me the idol.
No time to argue.
"Throw me the idol, I throw you the whip."
Give me the whip.
Adios señor.
Adios stupido.
Dr. Jones.
Again we see there is nothing you can possess which I can not take away.
And you thought I'd given up.
You choose the wrong friends.
This time it will cost you.
"Too bad the Hovitos don't know you the way I do, Belloq."
Yes.
Too bad.
You could warn them...
if only you spoke Hovitos.
"Jock, start the engine!"
Get it up!
Be in the moment?
Programs!
Anybody need programs?
"Buy it now, buy it now."
Programs.
Programs.
Programs.
"Hey, you want a program, man?"
- Thanks.
I'm good.
- Cool.
I got ice cream.
Anyone?
Want ice cream?
"- No, I'm good."
"- Ice cream, guys."
Who's--who's hungry?
Ice cream?
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Meeting Dave.
What are you doing here?
"Well, Dave gave me this ticket and told me to meet him here."
- What a jerk.
"- Well, look, I have zero intention of sitting here with you all night, so..."
Fine.
It's cool.
I'll watch the game by myself.
No way.
I'm gonna watch the game by myself.
No.
"If you're going in, I'm going in."
They're no way that you're gonna go in.
Straight ahead.
Turn left.
"Your kind of party, huh?"
I was never in a fraternity.
I was much too serious.
I bet you were 29 even when you were 19.
Put it this way.
"If I had to do it again,"
"I'd do it knowing that after you graduate, no one ever gives a fuck what your GPA was."
Hey!
Kim!
Hi!
"This is Sara, and Bridgitte and John."
- Hey.
How's it going?
- Cool.
Sorry about that.
"At the tone, please record your message."
"Chris, it's Jenna."
Michael and you both have your cell phones off.
"Listen, Izzy's dad just died."
"We're all gonna head over there, so I guess I'll see you guys there."
Bye.
Go ahead.
I'll be okay.
"- I want things to be okay, Daddy."
- I know.
Go ahead.
Take care of your friend.
I'm fine.
I really am.
You have no messages.
"- Excuse me, Jesse."
I've got to run.
- Have a great day.
"- Have yourself a ""morning air"" day."
- I will.
Filthy rich.
Let's call a spade a spade and a chicken a chicken.
"Julie, call me the minute that Peter Rickman is out of the OR."
- The very minute.
"- Yes, Dr. James."
Perhaps you can get me an update on Hook's progress.
"Yes, Dr. James."
"Okay, Elmer, there it is."
A three-pound universe.
What do you know?
Go back to sleep.
Elmer.
That nurse down there is no longer dancing to the sound of the Big Brass Band.
"Would you mind squirreling her away in a corner, please?"
Thank you.
What the hell did you just do?
I don't know.
How the hell should I know?
I'm just the dog.
Hook.
Yeah.
"Just slow down, Otto."
I'm on my way.
"Mrs. Rickman, I assure you..."
- Are you my husband's doctor?
- That would be Hook.
He was on call when Mr. Rickman was admitted.
(Laughing)
You try it.
"Come on, Michael, it don't hurt."
Give me your hand.
Mete Tu mano right there.
"Watch that, the water."
"Yeah, just like..."
Hold it right there.
"Wait for him, wait for him."
Ah!
You see that?
Yeah.
Bites.
Told you.
"Hey, um..."
"And thank you too, for sending me those pictures..."
While I was up north.
I don't know if I thanked you for that.
You're welcome.
Stop.
Just make sure you don't ride the clutch too much.
"You want to give her a break every once in a while,"
So she can last.
You pay for all this.
Otherwise you'll be back spending your money.
(Angela) Thank you.
You're welcome.
"(Hector) Manny, it's okay, papa, I'll close her out."
You sure?
"Yeah, esta bien."
(Radio playing music)
(Dance music on television)
There you go.
"This beautiful, exquisite, amazing..."
Uh...!
What?
What?
Um...
Did you know that you have a thing
- What?
- on... on your back?
Like a...
like a freckle?
Like a mole.
Is it gross?
"It's,uh,um..."
It's pretty big.
You need a doctor to look at this.
"Okay,yeah,um, you know what?"
"Uh,we should get out."
Come on.
You know what I want to do?
I want to go on the computer and check out one of those medical sites.
"I mean,I'm sure that it's nothing, but I'm gonna worry about it until I know for sure."
How could such an ugly mole end up on such a foxy lady?
Nature screwed up.
Come on.
Thank you for being so sweet to me.
Why wouldn't I be?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I hurt you.
Come on.
Bella?
Hey.
Don't hurt me.
Please.
Please.
Call her.
What?
Your mother.
Hello?
Mom?
Is that you?
"Are you all right, sweetheart?"
"I want to come home, Mom."
Keep it going.
Keep it going.
You will.
"You will, soon."
But first I need to explain to you why I wasn't there to protect you.
What are you talking about?
It wasn't your fault that--
Yes.
"Yes, it was."
I need to explain to you why I did the things I did.
"I have an addiction, and it kept me from being the mother I should have been for you."
An addiction?
Why are you--
"No, no, don't interrupt me, please."
You just need to listen.
Listen carefully.
I know you're brave.
I know you don't cry.
But you need to come home.
Come back to our house.
He's not gonna let me.
My daughter.
Where have you been?
"Maria, don't go!"
Don't leave me alone.
- Dad!
- Maria!
"- My baby, I missed you!"
- I'll tell Barbuda!
Where did your grandma take you?
Teach me how to walk on the tightrope.
I want to be part of your act.
- But you're so little!
"- Yeah, honey."
"Come on, please."
Teach me!
"We'll think about it, okay?"
Always remember that.
Aim at a spot ahead.
"Focus, and you won't fall."
"On the tips of your toes, then slide."
"Gently, just like that."
Yes.
Arms out and smile.
Smile to the crowd that's here to see you.
"Good, Maria."
"Did you see, Marcia?"
Our little acrobat!
Very good.
"Next, try it with the parasol."
Grab it either here or here.
Find the best grip.
Elegance.
Yes.
How old are you?
Twelve.
Is there someone inside you?
Sometimes.
Who is it?
I don't know.
Is it Captain Howdy?
I don't know.
"If I ask him to tell me, will you let him answer?"
No.
Why not?
I'm afraid.
"If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you."
Do you want him to leave you?
Yes.
I'm speaking to the person inside of Regan now.
"If you are there, you, too, are hypnotized and must answer all my questions."
Come forward and answer me now.
Are you the person inside of Regan?
Who are you?
-Help me!
- Let go!
Father Karras?
Have we met?
"No, we haven't met, but they said I could tell."
That you look like a boxer.
William F. Kinderman.
Homicide.
What's this all about?
It's true.
You do look like a boxer.
What was that?
Great!
Awesome!
What do we do?
No!
Jason!
Cynthia!
Cynthia!
Grab the oar!
Are you okay?
You all right?
Yeah.
We gotta go to shore!
"Cynthia, we're out of synch again."
"You know, you gotta paddle on the opposite side of the boat!"
"Well, Jason, I can't see which side you're paddling on!"
"Well, turn around and take a look every once in a while."
"Otherwise, we are gonna capsize again."
"You get that, right?"
It was an accident.
I'll bet it could have been avoided.
Right?
Am I right?
Baby' I need you to paddle.
"Cynthia, paddle the boat, please!"
You know what?
Sit down.
You've got to sit down in the boat!
Cynthia!
Cynthia!
Cynthia!
What are you doing?
I'm Kim.
I'm a psychologist and a feminist.
- I'll be paying the bill.
- I'm Wayne.
Wayne!
Glen.
How are you now?
"- Ah, good and you?"
"- Oh, not so bad."
"Well, I guess the kitten's out of the clutch on this one."
I also have to work as a waitress to make ends meet.
- WAYNE:
Sure you do.
- I'm Kim.
Are you ever.
Look at you.
I'm lovin' this.
You're like a shark.
I'm scared.
"Like a Julie Moore, or like a Jessie Chastain."
- What can I get you to drink?
"- Uh, we'll need a minute."
"Uh, please and thank you."
Hmm.
All right.
"Well, you'll take care of little Miss Nicki Kidman here till I get back, Mr. McConaughey?"
"- Sure, I will."
- All right.
He crosses his arms.
Are you aware of the psychology behind that?
"Now, when you say ""he,"""
"you're talking about me, right?"
Oh.
Kissing ass is part of the job.
We're hot right now.
It's expected of us.
"I was expected to be at my own wedding, but guess what."
- Where was I?
In your kitchen.
- When was this now?
Don't make this about me.
You need to be in the kitchen.
"I'd be happy to work the room for you,Jack."
People don't like you as much as you think.
Move.
"Look, this came down from the Prince of Darkness."
It's happening.
But don't worry.
I put somebody in charge.
"In which case, I humbly and gratefully accept."
- Hey.
"- Guys, this is Becky."
We went to culinary school together.
She'll be covering for me.
Uh
- I
- But you're a- She's a-
Yes.
I pee sitting down.
Get over it.
- Wait.
Becky Sharp from Becky's on Fourth?
- Mm-hmm.
- I love that place.
"Come on, up on the stools, everybody."
I've an announcement to make.
Quick.
"Come on, move it, move it, will yous?"
Come on!
"Quick, get up there!"
Would you take it easy?
Get her down off that.
People have to eat at the...
Get her off the stool!
Shut up!
Shut up!
"Happy birthday, Darren."
"Happy birthday, Darren."
"Yeah, good lad."
"There you go, what."
- What is it?
- Open it and see.
It's not a bike.
"He's brilliant, isn't he?"
I know that!
"- Ooh, wow."
- Very nice.
It's a pump.
"It's a very good one, too."
"See, I'm gonna get you a wheel for your Christmas... and another wheel for your next birthday... and then the saddle, what."
Ha ha ha ha.
You can pump yourself to school every morning now.
"Go away, you."
Yous are messing.
"We are, of course."
"Kay, when you're ready."
-It should be faster.
"-No, I get what she's doing."
It's sultry.
She's going for romantic.
"Is that what you're going for, Jane?"
A love song?
Come on!
Let him go.
"No, let him go!"
Let me at him!
Those are mine.
-What are?
-Your tits.
You're such a brute.
Hello.
Hi.
-Am I interrupting?
-Absolutely not.
"It's an unexpected pleasure, really."
We were just discussing romance.
Come on in.
"Sit down, come on."
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Yeah.
Have a good night.
I'm really starting to love this.
"It's dated, you know?"
It's not dated.
We just wrote it.
It doesn't even have a date on it yet.
-Why are you so contrary?
-You wouldn't respect me otherwise.
Hey.
I'm looking to score.
"You know, party favors."
"Come on, Coreen."
Do you want angel tears or crow?
Angel tears?
"Come on, come on..."
"angel tears is acid, crow is cocaine."
Come on.
I'm actually looking for something a little different.
"Evan told me about it, but I can't remember the name."
Venom?
That's it.
Venom.
Do you know where I can find any?
Something I said?
I've got a lead.
Over.
Oh!
Wynter.
"Hey, I hear you're looking for some venom."
"Yeah, do you know where I can get some?"
Um-hum...
How about straight from the source.
First time's free.
- You don't have to do this.
- You're wrong.
- I do.
- Ugh...oh...!
Let's be on our way.
- Why?
"- Well, didn't you know?"
"Jeez, not again."
Eva?
I'll have a look.
"Come on, shug?"
Hi.
Hello.
Hot.
Yeah.
"Um, dad's inside."
Mum too.
Ok.
But I'm glad to catch you.
Better get these iceblocks inside.
This won't take long.
Had us all quite worried that day you disappeared.
I told mum I was sorry.
Where'd you go?
Streets around Uncle Malcolm's.
I spoke to a bus driver.
Apparently a girl who looked a lot like you caught a bus out here that afternoon.
So?
So it wasn't you?
No.
I really gotta go.
Your father was quite desperate to find you.
He thought ms murnane may have harmed you.
She killed thom.
"He broke in, which was wrong, searching her house for you."
We found the jacket there.
I saw the news.
"Before he went over, I was talking to him on the phone."
So?
I can look like a man.
What do you think?
- How is Maria Concetta?
- She escaped.
"Then you didn't get anything, is that it?"
"Yes, and you're going blind."
You're even wearing glasses|.
"Well, the doctor says..."
It's just that my eyes are exhausted.
Are you worried about syphilis?
"So we don't want to hear about that, is that right?"
I'm not the one who has to worry about that.
Very good!
Very good!
So why are you scratching?
True.
Quiet!
I was waiting for you.
Everything alright?
"Yes, it's fine."

It's too hot.
"Ice, I want ice."

He wants ice.
"- Ice, I want ice."

"Okay, I'm going to wash it."
So put the pillow on now.
Now person number one is going to go.
Might be me.
Might be Rebecca.
"- Okay, you go."
- I don't want your cooties.
Wipe it off.
Okay.
Person number two- citizen two is beginning now.
Get away.
- Can I have the washcloth?
- The wet one or the dry one?
The dry one.
"So, what was the difference?"
"Yeah, who was better- number one or number two?"
You were exactly the same.
I couldn't tell the difference.
"As far as everything goes with you,Jim-"
Are you guys all packed foryour mom's?
Yeah.
- What's that?
- Dave planted it.
What a romantic guy.
I'm in here.
Come in.
Okay.
"Well, I'm off."
I'm just brushing my teeth.
"God, I used to hate that nightgown."
"Other people have to look at it, but they can't read it."
That's the point.
- I am so glad that you guys are here.
"- Well, thank you for inviting us."
We miss you.
"Yeah, well, Eddie's been out on the road, you know."
- Eddie's been on the road?
- Yeah.
"So the midget says, ""Hey, that's why I became a taxidermist."" Ha-ha-ha."
- Hey.
- You can't say that anymore.
"Whatever. ""Munchkin."" It's a good joke."
It's a good joke.
It's a good joke.
- What?
What?
- I keep missing things.
- I'm actually working on that...
"- Whoa, whoa, whoa."
- Hey.

Under control.
Under control.
Where is he going?
"Hey, you guys know the one about the Wisconsin farmer"
- and the burnt barn?
- I'm sure you're gonna tell us.
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
We've been through this before.
It's gonna be fine.
- Is everybody gone?
"- Yeah, they're gone."
- I'm really sorry.
Good God.
Er...
Lucy's the little one?
Yes.
- And her husband did that to her?
- It happens.
Does this have something to do with the other day?
Yes.
- But you don't want to talk to me about it?
- I can't.
All right.
I...
I understand.
- You do?
- She's your friend.
"Whatever you were trying to do for her, get her away from him, to..."
"Barking, whatever..."
Even if it didn't work that...was a good thing for a friend to do.
- Timothy...
"- No, no, I understand."
I didn't before.
But...
I do now.
Thank you.
- I was hoping to see her at the end of the day.
"- Yes, well, you must."
- You will be back in time for this...
"- Yes, of course."
- He was in the rubble for three days?
"- With her body, yes."
Jesus!
- Who was the psychiatrist they sent him to?
"Hiya, Red."
Here?
Bring him in.
Bring him down.
"I think you'll unbutton your lip now, Joe."
Maybe you'll talk to your son.
My what?
Here.
"Hiya, sonny boy!"
"Had a long trip today, huh?"
"Oh, sort of confused."
"Well, your old man's confused, too."
My father?
Is my father here?
Where?
"Right here, the great Joe Krozac."
"He's been pining for you, sonny boy."
Father?
That's not my father.
Sure it is.
Ain't he pretty?
Are you all crazy?
"Y- you're kidding, ain't you?"
How do I know this is my-my-
This ought to make it sink home.
See?
That's my father.
That's dads and mother.
"You're just kidnappers, aren't you?"
I see what you're heading for.
"No use trying anything with this kid, see?"
Because that ain't a picture of that dame.
All right.
He'll probably call me.
"No, no waiting."
We are in this situation because of your bullshit...
So sort yourself out and take care of the matter tonight.
Was that Vlad?
"I am going to smash your face in, you fucker!"

"Tonight, I want them to work flat-out."

It's a simple job.

But that goddamn woman...

"Okay, dad, you can't say that shit."
Come on.

"But, hey."
I lied.
I am thirsty.
[Pill bottles clacking]
I want you to get me a drink.
A real one.
You sure you're...
Allowed to do that?

- That way.
- Great.
Thanks.
- I got asked directions.
- I saw.
He took me for a native.
That's so cool.
That's very impressive.
44th is the other way.
- No.
- It's all right.
"Man, I should go find him."
He'll figure it out when he sees the numbers getting smaller.
He still thought I was a native.
That's cool.
I'm your witness.
"- Well, I should go."
- Okay.
I got to go to my mom's graduation.
- And give her Belinda.
- And give her Belinda.
Go on.
I'll check on the guy.
I'll make sure he's not wandering around looking for 44th.
Why did you come here?
- What?
"- I said, why did you come here?"
You ditched school and everything.
"Come on, I'm messing with you."
"It's nothing, really."
I'm ok.
This isn't your fault.
"Actually, it is."
You're a team leader.
You made a tactical decision.
And you got hurt.
Again.
You did what you thought was right.
And that's all you can do.
"The rest of it, that's not up to us."
That's the job.

"Well, uh, at least sit down and have a drink."
Why not make it two?

"- Well, I'll have a little one."

Heh.
How much?
"Oh, about two ounces."
One for each kidney.

"Oh, uh, chaser?"

This guy's a murderer.
A murderer!

"Well, I think about my wife tracy every day,"
And then I see his face.
I wanted something to put him away.

Mm-hmm.
"Oh, guys, check this shit out."
I woke up holding a winning ticket.
"Daddy's revenge, 20 grand!"
Oh!
- God damn it!
- Oh.
I knew you'd outlive me.
"I'm invincible, sweetheart."
"All right, let's see who won the pool."
When did you wake up?
"Uh, let's call it 11:20."
That's my square!
250 bucks!
"I love you, Frank."
"I love you too, dollface."
Five minutes off.
You bet on my dad's death?
You didn't?
"Ah, baby, you won the over/unders."
100 bucks.
Everybody's a winner.
"Stink hand, watch the door."
Daddy needs a cigar.
"- Oh, no, no, no, no, no."
"- Oh, for God's sakes, Frank."
"No, no, Dad, Dad, Dad, come on."

"- What happened, Ted?"
- I did what you asked for.
- I'm tired.
- I've been fighting you for so long.
- You don't have to fight any more.
"He's a liar, Ted."
I said it all ends today.
These agents.
It all ends today.
- What does that mean?
- It means he's decided on an endgame.
He's going to kill himself and the hostages.
"Ted, no one on this train is an agent but me."
No one else.
I'm the only one.
You can let everybody else go.
"I don't think so, Ted."
Do you?
"Dr. Bryar, we need to get this woman help."
"I don't think so, Ted."

"Dr. Bryar, we need to get this woman help."

That's why you called.
- He's the best in Chicago.

Touchy subject.
- Is he all right?
- Mouth-to-mouth's not working.
- His airway's blocked.
- Paramedics are coming any minute.
- That Medevac copter will take us.

He'd suspect foul play!

"Oh, Mumsie!"
I'll go by the service stairs to avoid him.
Is everything clear?
Good.
I'll be in the car at the front.

"If I don't, they're going to kill my husband."
- You know they will.
- You got to go to Martello
- No.
They'll be watching for that.
"- Well, they're gonna be"
- watching me too.
- That's why I put distance between us.
"You could have gone to Hart, or anyone."
Why come to me?
Because you know.
You know who we're dealing with.

Yeah.
I know.

Please get my husband back.

Call 9-1-1.
No.
We can't call the cops.
"Dude, you are on your third strike."
I'm on my fourth.
He's right.
You can't go back.
"You guys, we have to, we have to worry about getting out of here alive first."
Stupid phone.

Hello.
Sheriff's Department.
I'm in a house at the very end of Sange Road.
"There's, there's four of us."
We're being held against our-

I'm a white person!
Shit.
I don't know if it went through.
Let's go upstairs.
Okay.
Stay together.
Go upstairs.
"Yeah, I like that idea."
Hello.
Is someone there?
My name is Vivian Thorpe.
I have been a prisoner in here for weeks now.
Wait.
We have to get a signal first.
"We're here, sweetie."
It's a party!
Ring it.
Come here.
Don't worry.
Everything will be all right.
Barbuda loves you.
"Barbuda, honey."
"Darling, I've missed you!"
It's Quico's party.
He's staying with me for a while.
Do you remember Quico?
Why didn't you tell me she'd be arriving today?
We thought it'd be better to wait a while.
You could've told me.
"Mrs. Maria Cecilia, the circus is on the road."
We didn't know exactly when it would stop nearby.
Nearby!
We walked almost for two hours.
- You live pretty far away!
"- Fine, I see."
"What really matters is that you're here, my doll."
Let me look at you.
You didn't grow much in these past fewyears.
Let me see your face.
Come on.
You look so much like -
Mrs. Maria Cecilia.
Here are her things.
- Is this all?
"- Yes, ma'am."
"Come on, Maria."
"Come on, hurry!"
Shit.
Who the fuck are you?
What the hell?
"Stop, goddamn it!"
"Stop it, you dirty slut!"
You whore!
"Eat this, too."
"Man, you're heavy."
I'm getting too old for this.
Don't be ridiculous.
Old ladies tell me men can still get it up after 70.
Then buy me some herbal supplements.
I keep having fucked-up nightmares.
What're you doing in there?
Oh hell.
Shit!
Nothing!
Get away from the car.
- Don't open it!
- What are you doing?
For crying out loud!
Dad!
Dad?
Look.
How do I look?
Pretty.
Freakishly pretty.
How long were you watching?
How much did you see?
"Don't worry, I won't tell."
So you saw everything.
Ride 'em in.

MUMBLE:
Okay.
This 'berg needs to topple.
Find yourself an elephant seal and show them the moves.
"Penguin, how's a bit of fancy dancing gonna move that?"
"With enough oomph, we can shove enough snow."
Pack it in behind.
It'll go.
BRYAN:
It's not gonna happen.
That's a whopping pile of 'berg!
Just try it.
Hit the beat hard!
And together!

We can talk later.
Let's talk now.
"Lydia, come on!"
Ly... wait!
Why are you asking Lydia about Jackson's real parents?
Why are you bringing out the claws on camera?
That's right.
You wanna play catwoman?
I'll be your Batman.
"If you're wondering about Jackson's real parents, they're about half a mile from here."
In beacon hills cemetery.
I...
I have to get to cl...

"No, you have perfect grades."
You can skip one class.
Are you okay?
Your heart's beating like crazy.
Allison.
Do you know how they died?
Maybe.
If you tell me why you're so interested.
Um...
"It's him, isn't it?"
What?
Who?
Him who?
"The test didn't work, but it's still him."
It's Jackson.
Woman Singing Pop Ballad]
I thought we were through the hard times.
You know?
Mm-hmm.
"I'd been sick for about three months... uh, and he was just so amazing."
"He took such great care of me and the kids, and..."
- This is gonna sound weird. [Chuckles]
- Please.
My life?
No judgment.
L-lt's not that I wanted him to be sick or anything like that... but I...
I wanted... the opportunity... to show him that I could be there for him.
You know?
I haven't always been.
I've been going on and on.
You haven't.
This is what recovery is all about.
"You know, opening up, being honest."
Okay.
"So, tell me about you."
[Chuckles]
"Uh, recovering drunk."
"Wife, sister, mother."
"Two kids... boy, 10, girl, 8."
Uh...
I don't know.
Life gets pretty boring when you stop drinking.
What kind of work do you do?
[Sighs] Assembly line.
Boring.
- Come on.
I told you.
"10 years ago to this day, his father died here."
He was waiting for a train as he did every evening.
"He had a good job, happy family."
"And one evening, he'd had enough."
"And when the express came by, he jumped."
Was he a friend of yours?
"And these last few days,"
Dennis has come here every evening.
- Every evening.
- Do you ever answer a question?
Look at him.
- Why should I?
- Look at him.
"Because in about two minutes,"
Dennis there will be dead.
What the f...
You're crazy.
Completely crazy.
"You gotta take the Chambers Street Exit, right across the platform."
Look!
He's got a gun!
He's got a gun!
He's got a gun!
"Listen, don't do it!"
"Please, put the gun down!"
Is this your first time?
You seem kind of young.
He's here to see Dr. Kay.
- Okay.
- He'll come get you in the day room.
- This way?
- Mm-hmm.
"You will go back to school, won't you?"
"Well, if we was to go back to school, could we get as smart as Tia and Tony?"
- Maybe even smarter.
"- Yeah, sure."
Let's give it a shot.
Great.
I hope the school can take it.
"- Goodbye, Yo-Yo."
- Goodbye.
"- See you later, Yo-Yo."
- You promised.
"Tia, open the gate."
"No, everybody join hands."
Cool!
All right!
Flying saucer!
Will we ever see you again?
"Well, it's... it's kind of hard to say."
Thanks for everything.
And especially for letting me be in your gang.
"Take care of Alfred for me, OK?"
There you are.
- Where's your luggage?
"- Uh, we lost it."
There were a few problems.
- But you did have fun?
"- Oh, terrible."
I just knew we should have gone surfing.
Hey.
Let's do it the way Tia and Tony taught us.
Yeah.
- Ready?
"Joanie, I got a surprise."
"Oh, is it a food surprise?"
I love food surprises.
What on earth is that?
It's a mini-horse.
"Her name is Lemonade, and she's come to live in our house forever."
What?
- Isn't she great?
- No!
It looks like a child in an animal suit.
"Well, come on, give her a pet."
- (neighs) - (gasps)
Oh!
"Now, that's no way to treat family, Lemonade."
Be nice.
Aw...
Now you're just flirting to flirt.
She'll come around.
I promise you.
"Come on, girl."
Let's go night-night.

"Oh, where could he be?"
-Can I help pump the gas?
-Sure!
I'll even let you drive.
-Yeah?

Great.
How am I gonna convince those guys it was an accident?

Ha!
You're alive!
This is great!

I want to come with you.
"No, out of the question."
"You don't want to, Helene."
It's sons and their father in the woods.
Or else they'll turn out gay.
Promise to use a life vest and water wings.
And the boys too.
- Bye bye!
- Bye.
Hi.
- Can we talk?
- What do you want to talk about?
- We could start with Jorgen?
- Stop already.
Listen.
Can I come in?
Thanks.
- So talk about Jorgen.
- Can we sit down?
We could find a chair.
This is fine.
May I sit here?
Okay...
Did you know Jorgen asked me to administer a fund?
- No.
What fund?
- It's aid work.
With Anna.
- You'll run it with Anna?
- With Anna.
"It's a very generous offer, but he's dragging things out."
I want to know what's going on.
-In the back.
Gimme a bromo for my friend here.
"I'll take a small steak, two eggs on top some fries, juice, and a side order of toast...."
"Yes, sure."
Right away.
"Look out for that stomach, huh?"
Here we fix you up one second.
You'll feel much better.
Okay.
"See you, huh?"
We'll have your steak ready in a minute.
Where's my buddy?
"Oh, he left."
He left?
-What are you talkin' about?
"-Hey, what's a matter?"
You okay?
The guy drove off on me.
How are you gonna figure that?
"Oh, I think your steak's ready."
Thank you.
"Oh, no!"
-What?
-He took my wallet.
I left the raincoat in the car and....
I can't even pay you for this.
"Tell me, where you goin' anyway?"
-Down to L.A.
-Why?
I was goin' down for a job.
The whole thing's in the wallet.
-What kind of job?
Missed calls
- Shaman
What the hell?
What the...?
Hello.
It's me.
Where are you?
What about you?
Don't ask me anything.
You need to get to your daughter.
Now.
Tell me what's going on?
I'm at your place.
"Get back to your house, now."
First tell me what's going on.
L.
I misread the divination.
It's not him.
What are you talking about?
I cast the hex on the wrong ghost.
I saw a woman in front of your house.
I made a grave mistake.
"A terrible, terrible mistake."
It's not the Japanese man.
That woman is the evil spirit.
It was all her doing.
"So, go home now."
"I'm on my way there, too."
"Then""."
Who's the Japanese man?
He was trying to kill that woman in order to save people from her.
Understand?
What...
What is going on?
I needed to see you.
And this is how you do it?
Uh...
You abandoned me.
You walked away from me when I needed you the most.
- I'm sorry.
- That's not good enough!
"After the accident, I had to get my life together."
And what about my damn life?
It took me two years to get back on my feet.
You were the only thing that kept me going.
"Kaman, what happened to you?"
What do you think happened to me?
[Boy] Mommy?
Who else is here?
"Mommy, what's wrong?"
[Woman] That's my sister's son.
"Uh, go back upstairs, baby."
- Go back upstairs.
- Wait a minute.
Wait.
"He said ""Mama."""
"The boy's confused, Kaman."
Is that your son?
"[Tracy] No, Kaman."
Don't you stand in front of me and lie to my face.
"Kaman, drop it."
"You shoot me, I drop this, and they burn."
Then what?
"You move, you die."
[engine starts]
I can't stop the car.
Tony's energizing it.
It's like your brother doesn't even know you.
- [Rocky] it's yo-yo.
Let's go!
- No.
Don't run.
You crazy?
You don't want to go to that school.
"Please, trust me."
"Now, come on, hurry."
"[Rocky] hey, wait for me."
"[dazzler] come on, you guys."
Get in there.
- Let's go!
"- Come on, get in."
- [door shuts]
- I'm dreaming.
You're surrendering to the board of education?
"Sir, you see that car going down the street?"
- Yeah.
- My brother's in it.
He ought to be going to school.
You ought to catch up with him.
Another truant?
"Oh, boy, we're gonna have a load."
"- Hey, what happened?"
"- Good driving, yo-yo."
"Yeah, that was neat."
[laughs] this bus can really move.
"Tony, look through the window."
Is anything wrong?
I was scared by the lightning and Stan hasn't gotten home yet and I just didn't want to be alone in the house.
When do you expect him?
He didn't say when he'd be back.
I'm terribly sorry.
"But as you probably know, Lynn and I are concerned about Stan."
I had a feeling that something was wrong with Stan.
A hunch.
So I drove out to see if everything was okay.
- I'm sorry.
"- Of course, I understand."
It was nice to see you again.
"Bye-bye, Lynn."
"Douglas, what is it?"
I don't know.
I don't know.
I have a strange feeling something's wrong.
A feeling like I had when Bobby...died.
Stan?
Stan?
Stan is here.
My brother is here.
And he's dead.
My brother is dead.
It could be Bobby.
No.
"No, it's Stan."
Pull yourself together.
He's dead.
And dead is dead.
I have to sit down.
Stan?
The building's almost empty.
Switching over to condos or some kind of gentrification or some kind of shit.
"make sure that this guy is working alone , Ross."
Pretty sure. landlord says the guy is a loner .
This happen tomorrow.
Can you handle it?
Of course we can handle it.
You got the specs' ?
Now we good ?
"Yea , we're good."
"Come on, Daze."
Do you gals know about Barbie Sunday's new dress ?
"Yea, we know."
Just checking.
Daze !
Yea ?
Happy Birthday!
"Thanks , Russ."
"If you keep an eye on your partner, you might be around to see her next one."
"Fuck off, Russ!"
Ask her about Rose.
I said :
"Fuck off, Russ!"
Who's Rose?
My old partner.
I thought I was your only ...
"Sorry, Daze ."
"Well, what happened to her?"
She died.
How?
Got shot.
How?
What's up?
I'll get the car.
I'll see if I can reach it.
I'm almost touching the water.
Careful!
Are you okay?
"I got it, pull me up!"
Estrella was wearing hose like those.
Freeze!
Stop!
Why are you running?
- I don't have a permit.
- What is that?
- A baby deer?
- Roebuck.
- Where are you from?
- The town.
Get up.
- What's your name?
- Jesus.
"You and I met the other night at the fair, remember?"
My head still hurts from the gin.
- How did you get here?
- I walked.
- It's along walk.
- Not if you know the trails.
See anyone go in or out of the farmhouse?
I don't like that place.
Nothing but ghosts around.
Can I go?
- How much do you get for Bambi?
- 250 pesetas a kilo.
Must be somebody famous.
Name's Obediah Jackson.
"Chris, let me see that."
"What's wrong, Nathan?"
Somebody you know?
He's my father.
Hyah!
NATHAN:
How much further to Eagle Bend?
Town's just over that rise.
We should take a look before we ride in.
[chattering ]
"Can't do this, sheriff."
"No disrespect, judge, but this is my town."
-Looks like a hanging party.
-Let me see.
To the right of the water tower.
NATHAN:
That's my father.
"Now, hold on, Nathan."
No sense riding into a lynch mob without a plan.
Let's do this together.
Come on.
Enough of this.
We don't need a trial.
Let's go.
Somebody grab some rope and tie up his hands.
-The man deserves a trial.
-l can walk. I'm a free man.
"Yeah, you're free to swing."
Get a rope.
Tie up his hands.
That's not living.
Okay.
- Call me when you get home safe?
- Mm-hm.
Okay.
"- Bye, Stefan."
- Goodbye.
Don't look at me like that.
- Are you crazy?
"- Save the lecture, look..."
Damn it.
I remember them.
From 1864.
They were in the tomb.
Yeah.
About that.
Matt.
- Matt.
"- I don't wanna hear it, Mom."
"Matty, please."
"Do you know what I was doing tonight, Mom?"
I was having fun.
Trying to forget about all the crap that I have to deal with every day.
Just enjoy a night with my friends.
"And then, there you are."
"Wasted at the bar, where I work, by the way to pay the bills that you don't pay."
And then you're off acting like a freaking kid?
Hooking up with some guy half your age.
"I'm the kid, Mom."
You're supposed to be responsible for me.
"I know, Matt."
How was your night?
–Yeah.
Over here.
"While I was checking the bathroom, this tile fell off."
It looks directly into Kayla's bathroom.
"Oh, God."
"Oh, God."
We got to get an A.P.B out on their car.
Jesus.
–You okay?
–Better than you.
"Looks like I taught you my last lesson, huh?"
Don't end up like me.
I shouldn't have dragged you into this.
Going after that guy was the right thing to do.
"–Hell, I got you shot."
–I always knew there was a bullet with my name on it.
And guess what?
I'm still here.
So are you.
"Hey, you really ought to get in there and see him."
Yeah.
Me and Vic aren't really talkin' right now.
He'd want to see you.
–Yeah?
–Yeah.
"Hey, what the hell is going on?"
"We found the peephole, Bob."
–What are you talking about?
This is ridiculous.
–Step away!
–It's clean.
–Pop it.
You're so unreasonable.
Let me do my work first?
Only 2 photos left and I'm done.
Shit.
I can't breathe.
Hey body.
"You really mean to get back at me now, right?"
Bring it on.
I'm not afraid.
Death is a natural thing for me.
I used to think we should all design our own funerals.
I want my funeral... to not be at a temple.
It can be in this room.
Just a nice coffin and flowers.
I like TK a lot.
Never seen them live.
I would want them to sing at my funeral.
I want them to sing the song 'Handkerchief'.
It's a hit song so everyone can sing along.

Not many.
I'm not sure whether I want the doctor to come or not.
"I am sorry, doc."
I...
I died.
I broke my promise.
I don't have time to argue with you.
I will take full responsibility for this.
This boy is gonna die!
Let's do it.
It's a great story.
Let's go!
- What are you doing?
- I need supplies.
- I need a portable defibrillator.
- I got a spare.
- You're taking a hell of a chance.
- Damn right!
Let's go!
Hold it right there.
Here we go.
"One, two, three."
There's no room in here.
Give me the camera.
- All set.
- Get a minicam van and meet me at County.
"Here, here."
Close the door.
Let's go!
Patch your headsets back to the station.
- How's he doing?
- He's okay.
- You're filming this?
- We're live from Chopper Five with Dr....
"- What's your name, doctor?"
- Doug Ross.
Dr. Doug Ross from County General.
Just minutes ago Dr. Ross rescued a boy from a storm drain.
Who is this?
Look at that.
Get in!
-Son Son.
-OK.
OK.
"Come on, boy."
Come here.
"Lu, what did you say this guy?"
Nothing.
He said you told him I I killed a woman and a child from that type.
What?
It's the same thing for you.
You're supposed to be representative Act.
What is this shit?
Fuck off.
Both.
Have you two last words you want to say to each other?
"Toni, I think it should be to kill them now."
"It will be tough for them outside,"
Since they will not know how to handle them.
Maybe Ray is killed while resisting arrest.
Came home late at night...
Burglar could kill him.
"Uneasily with you, boy?"
Get up!
You look uncomfortable.
I'm sorry.
What?
-I'm sorry.
-What did you say?
"I will not kill you, son."
Put me down.
Put me down!
Henry.
"They underestimate you, okay?"
Let them get close and then engage.
Engage!
No.
Henry!
Fight back!
Come on!
"No, stop it!"
- You stop it!
Stop it!
- What?
- Stop it!
- Estelle...
No!
"You're a fucking rabbit in the headlights, aren't you?"
It's all right.
I'm not here to hurt you.
Is your speech module installed?
Shit.
"Well, at least we know you're not deaf."
"It's all right, you can put your hands down now."
3 years I've been waiting for this moment and I get Charlie fucking Chaplin.
"Fuck's sake, come on!"
"All right, let's have a look at you."
"Open the glove box, please."
Take out that whole contraption.
You gotta untangle the wires.
Is that a wedding ring?
Are you... are you married?
Nothing else?
Well.. she couldn't care less about who were you dating.
That she only cared about when you're with me.
And that she weren't calm we I'd leave.
What does Clara mean by that?
I want to meet Luisa.
Do you want to know how is she?
-Yes.
Luisa sings.
Does she play the guitar?
I don't think so.
Why not if she sings?
She doesn't sings modern songs.
She sings opera?
-Yes.
She's studying.
She haven't performed yet.
Then Berta was right.
She's much younger than you.
She is exactly 23 years old.
Much younger than mom.
And even younger than Berta!
He's 18.
He's studying economics.
He's 5 years older than you?
And what do you talk about?
Dunno.
About everything.
What do you talk with Luisa?
About everything too.
But it's not the same.
Why not?
Go sightseeing?
If it's a nice day?
"-Yeah, let's do that."
-Okay.
"And tomorrow night, I'll take you to a movie."
Okay?
"Oh, I love you."
"I love you, Rags."
"We'll have a good day, yeah?"
"You can bring Mr. Dennings, if you like."
Mr. Dennings?
"Well, you know, it's okay."
"Well, thank you very much but why on earth would I wanna bring Burke on your birthday?"
"Well, you like him."
"Yeah, I like him."
Don't you like him?
"Hey, what's going on?"
What is this?
"-You're gonna marry him, aren't you?"
"-Oh, my God."
Are you kidding?
-What?
-Me marry Burke Dennings?
Don't be silly.
Of course not.
Where did you ever get an idea like that?
But you like him.
Of course I like him.
"I like pizzas too, but I'm not gonna marry one."
You don't like him like Daddy?
"Regan, I love your daddy."
"I'll always love your daddy, honey."
We have to come up with something.
It won't be easy.
He'll think of something.
"Come, I'll help you."
I'm sure he would've taken us to the embassy in Sofia.
"No way, Louise."
The Turks may take offence at the King's frolic.
It may result in a diplomatic incident.
He would've taken us to Istanbul to avoid a scandal.
We are going home.
In an ambulance.
"Ludovic, the filming has to stop."
- Sire?
- I want to drive the car.
Excuse me?
You heard me.
- I will miss you.
- Jump in.
Han Solo springt in den Millennium Falcon.
- Hi.
- Hi.
And my donut?
END
I think he had a heart attack.
- We write a song.
- We write a song.
"- It is called ""boat"". - ""Boot""."
He goes so ...
Let's sing it simple.
Stop to sit at home and mope.
I can not bear.
It's repulsive.
Hospital graveyard.
- Maybe you should get it.
- Me?
Come on.
- Maybe you can come some good.
- So what is it that will help?
"- You're a cop, John."
I would be safe.
"- No one is safe benleyken, Rache."
Thank you.
- Where is Mike?
- There were some things he has to do.
- Work like?
"- Yes, I like business."
- You bring me Bella.
"- Yes, I brought."
- Who are you?
- My name is John.
"Brother, I wanted to look after a while."
- Do you always sleep with him?
- His name is Bella.
She is a girl bear.
"- My brother, say I'm too big for him."
- I never would not be very large.
Try to sleep a little.
- Will you tell me a story?
- I do not know any story.
Then we make up one.
My mother does this.
"Once upon a time, once upon ..."
Long long time ago ...
"Once upon a time, once upon ..."
- Nitrous?
"- Yes, please."
No.
More booze for me.
Seems all right?
"""Seems"" being the operative word, mate."
This will cheer you up.
"Shame Felix can't be here, he's always talking about you guys."
Really?
Yeah.
"I mean, you're his friends, right?"
"Yes, we are his very, very, very good friends, aren't we?"
Good old Mr. Felix.
"So, tell us about Chile."
Musta been a big decision.
"Uh, the family thought it would do him good."
Toughen him up finally.
Make him big and strong like his big brother.
"Oh, my God."
You have to feel this.
"It's like a rock, Gemma."
You'll have to excuse her.
- She isn't house-trained.
"- No, seriously, come on, have a big..."
- I'm so sorry.
- That's all right.
I'll sort it out.
My God.
Go on.
"Oh, sorry."
"Hi, there."
You've got a lot of scars.
You'll live longer wearing my suit.
Make one for yourself.
24 inches!
Must be a good fighter.
Thank you.
Three foot!
What kind of cuff you like?
Wen's style.
6-inch cuffs.
2-foot splits and 5-foot-long suit.
1.8 foot for shoulders.
30 inches waist.
What are the needles for?
The secure your button.
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.
Let me measure your neck.
Have you finished?
I would have if you had cooperated.
What else you want to do?
Choose the material.
I'll take the piece on your hand.
Cut it.
I know you're the Demon Tailor!
Why do you want to kill me?
My Big Brother Tam King is angry with you.
Can you tell Mr. Tam?
"I want to be his friend, Liang Foon!"
Master!
- Give him his scissors!
"- Yes, Master!"
It's difficult to clean.
"When I was a kid, a tenement on our block collapsed."
Buried some people alive.
"From then on, every time I passed that spot,"
I believed I could always hear them moaning and crying for help.
You through there?
Get started upstairs.
"Why don't you go to bed, Stan?"
Why should I?
Because you make me sick to my stomach.
Douglas...
"All right, Stan."
"You've had enough, let's go."
Mr. Gordon will excuse you.
Let's go.
Excuse me?
Do you think I had too much to drink?
"Whoa, wait."
Wait a minute.
Wait.
"Good night, my dear."
Mr. Gordon.
"Let's go, Dougie."
Come on.
Here we go.
I want to show you that I can be neighbourly too.
Lynn?
"Well, he's in bed."
Probably dead to the world by now.
"Thank you, Doug."
"Good night, Gordon."
It's been a pleasure.
- Thank you.
Whoo!
I'm right...
First big piece!
First big piece.
It just went up the hose.
After empty searches.
And near-death dives.
And with the weight Of the pomrenke empire.
On his shoulders...
Mr. Gold strikes again.
Shawn Has finally found gold.
Where his dad always Doubted he would.
Whoo!
I've dealt with setbacks My whole life.
"And, you know, You don't give up."
You just keep pushing forward.
"Yeah, buddy!"
"Yeah, buddy!"
Hard work pays off.
Yeah!
"Flip that flap up, and let's See what it looks like."
Look at that!
Yeah!
Look at that nugget!
- Wow!
- -holy.
That's a big Nugget there.
"Now for the pomrenke name, The sky is the limit."
There's a lot of gold Off this ground.
There's gold at the bluff.
So dad can't give Me anymore.
"100 miles west,"
"Oh, grow up, Robin."
There's no such thing as ghosts.
"Nate, can you please help me?"
Technically...
He's right.
- What?
- Yes.
I... but you're also right.
It feels...
Very wrong.
- Yeah.
- But that is not for you to judge.
"You know, if... if he wants to do this..."
I do.
"And she, for some reason, wants to do this..."
"- Yes, please."
- Nate:
And she approves...
"- Yes, of course."
- Then...
"Well, it sounds like we just completed our vows."
"Robin, let's make this official."
Somebody please object.
I object!
Because I love her!
- [Speaks Russian]
- I know so much about you!
I know you like snack chips.
I like snack chips!
You're a side sleeper.
"I'm a side sleeper, right?"
You read a magazine on the potty.
Across the street?
That's where I was born.
Salute.
Kid got a nice mother?
"She's the sweetest, kindest, most beautiful woman I've ever known."
Why?
"Well, 'cause daddy ain't gonna live long drinking like that."
"Hey, don't even talk to me like that, man."
"It's a celebration tonight, and I don't need to hear that."
Robbie.
"Hey, Sonny."
"Tell me, boy or girl?"
I got a son.
"That's great, man."
Let's go see the family.
Why don't you have a drink with me first?
The doc wants them to rest up for a little while.
Everything okay?
Everything's all right.
"Julia, she's just knocked out, though."
She was in labor for 15 hours.
You're kidding me.
I'm not kidding.
How's the kid?
How's the kid?
He's great.
Black Jack.
That's terrific.
How much did he weigh?
"Eight pounds, six-and-a-half ounces."
Wow!
You got yourself a big boy.
Enough.
Do you want vada?
You mean firebrand?
OK
Hey why is a thread coming out of it?
-Got torn.
I only stitched it together.
- You stitched it?
Yes
Where is the chef?
It's one week since he left for hometown.
Then what about this vada?
"Well, he made it before leaving."
Oh!
Damn you all.
Why did you leave the table?
- I want to live a little longer.
- He is Das.
- OK thanks.
- Well I have a client approaching in the morning itself.
Yes I am Das.
Haridas.
- The best house broker in South India.
-What can I do for you?
-I am Karthik.
-So what?
- I am a lawyer and I need a house for rent.
A lawyer?
- You look too timid.
Can you raise your voice?
"- Yes, I can."
It's very difficult to find a house for a lawyer.
-l tell her 20 times!
-l'll take the dog.
The dog's not going to a pound.
You got a green card?
-You want to see?
"-No, get out of here."
Take off.
SUPER:
He's crazy.
What that has to do with my green card?
Ridiculous.
-We better go talk to Roberts.
-Let's tell Mike.
Like he doesn't know.
"Poor kid. I tried to straighten her out. i mean, I really tried."
-l even prayed for her.
You believe it?
-Talk about last night.
"I saw her a lot, you know, maybe too much."
"Maybe I even loved her a little, even, you know, like..."
... takingcareof herand everything and making sure she was safe.
"-That kind of love, know what I mean?"
"-Last night, Mike."
ROBERTS:
What about it?
She died.
-When did you see her last?
Yesterday. I saw her with you guys.
You guys saw.
You didn't see her after that?
"Hey, what are we, gonna go bare knuckles here?"
-What do you want me to say?
Come in.
Take a look around.
It's fine.
-No. I couldn't.
-You can.
Let me get you something.
All I have is water and OJ. I hope that's all right.
What about the champagne?
"I mean, if you want to."
Sure. I guess a little champagne between colleagues never hurt.
"You know, Pacey Witter, you are such a doll."
I have so much respect for you having the strength not to act on this thing.
-And what thing would that be?
-You know the thing.
This heat.
I felt it tonight when you hugged me.
I felt it that time when we kissed.
"-Oh, gee!"
"-Shut the door, Pacey."
It'll keep the heat in.
Audrey.
Audrey!
"Audrey, stop."
Let me explain.
I don't wanna hear your explanations.
-lt's clear to me.
-She just dropped by.
And you were trying so hard to get her to leave.
-lt is not what it looks like.
-Go back!
-Nothing happened!
-You kissed her!
Harry.
"What are you doing here, Bea?"
"- Oh, Harry, then you're not..."
- Not what?
"Oh, I don't know."
I had the strangest feeling.
- I thought...
- Yes?
You thought?
That you were going away without ever seeing me again.
"Well, why would I do that, Bea?"
- I love you.
Why...
"- Oh, I know."
"But I lost you for a moment, Harry."
- I was afraid.
- But you're not afraid now?
Of course not.
"Well, you see that everything's all right nothing has happened, that I'm the same as I ever was?"
Of course.
- It must have been a dream.
"- Yes, yes, a dream."
You're not angry with me?
Angry?
"Oh, I don't want you to leave me."
Ever.
"Oh, darling."
I love you so much.
- Please don't send me away.
- No.
"Yes, Father?"
It's a good thing I was worried about your behavior tonight.
We're just sitting here.
Let's go there tonight.
Let's make them pay for this.
"Sure, sure now we're doing drive bys."
Just like a fucking street gang.
Then what are we going to do?
I don't know?
I don't know?
"You know if you put your gun away, it will help you bury your cousin."
Italian
"wow, wow."
What did you call me?
"All right, all right."
Enough.
Enough.
What did you call me?
"Dino, dino."
"Dino let him up, dino!"
Are you listening to me?
Are you trying to kill him?
Shut up Vic.
"Yes, I'm trying to kill him."
I will kill him.
God damn it.
"Rudy just give the man what he wants, huh?"
Did I hear you say you were sorry?
Tell him?
Did I hear you say I'm sorry?
Did I hear you say I'm sorry?
Jesus Christ.
"Did I hear you say you're sorry, huh?"
I'm sorry.
[Thunder rumbling]
"Ursula, I'm sorry if I upset you."
Thank you.
Don't you think you're behaving rather oddly?
"Janet, you've apologized."
I've accepted your apology.
"Just leave it at that, please."
- All right for you?
- Get out.
Jump in.
You'll get soaked.
"Oh, blooming' heck!"
I knew this was comin'.
"Oh, what's all this about?"
It's for your patient.
Ain't my patient.
[Dorcas]:
Bit of a fog in here.
She were a cracker 40 year ago.
Do you think he's ready for this?
"If it gets him from the bed to the chair, it's a start."
"He mustn't put any weight on the ankle, though."
Do be careful.
- Oh!
Bravo.
"- Oh, goodness."
Good.
Right.
I'll see you in a week or so.
[Loud]:
Don't try and run before you can walk.
[Man on radio]:
Hey.
Come on.
It's an aftershock...
it'll stop in a second.
Pancakes !
"Oh, my God."
Kirsten ?
Kirsten ?
"Over here, Mr. Cohen."
Sandy.
Something is not right.
Nothing works.
It's like an information blackout.
"Well, the aftershock probably took out a power line or something."
"So listen, I'm going to go on foot and get help, I think."
"No, no, no."
"Well, we can't stay here."
I don't even know where here is.
"Well, I'm going with you."
"No, it's cool."
"Listen, I'm going to come back as soon as I can."
Promise.
What about the zombies ?
That's a really good point.
Okay.
"All right, buddy."
We have to keep you alert and on your feet.
"Now, when last we checked the list..."
Need some help ?
Yeah.
...we were on Trey.
Mm-hmm.
Would you like to purchase?
Hey.
Hey.
You're not knocking anymore?
I'm sorry.
What are you doing?
Uh...just busy.
You're always busy.
That's the price of fame.
"I gotta go, Dad."
They found Ryan.
Or spotted someone who meets his description.
There was a fight down by the pier.
Really?
Which means he's probably still in the area.
We should go try to find him before the authorities do.
Before he gets into any more trouble.
"Actually, do you need me to go?"
I was going somewhere.
Seth.
He's your friend.
Yeah.
Okay.
Hey.
Hey!
So what's up?
You've been all weird-acting lately.
Yeah?
I don't know.
I guess...
It's just...
Do you ever wonder what your life looks like through someone else's eyes?
Tommy!
They opened up the books.
Paulie got the okay.
Can you believe that?
This little Guinea bastard.
He's getting made.
We'll work for this guy one day.
He's gonna be a boss.
I can't believe it.
I'm really happy for you.
That's great.
Congratulations.
"Motherfuckers, we got them now."
"Jimmy, I've been looking all over for you, baby."
"Jimmy, can I talk to you for a second?"
"I mastermind the Goddamned thing, I'm left with dick."
They'd be up a creek without a paddle if not for me.
Fuck him!
I want my money.
"Henry, I want my fuckin' money!"
I've had it up to here!
That cheap cigarette hijacking Mick.
"-No, fuck him!"
I want my money!
-Good.
Go tell him.
"Are you gonna keep your mouth shut, or what?"
Huh?
"Morrie, you're gonna get your money."
You just got to stop busting balls.
Look at me.
You hear me?
"I'm a scum, not caring for the table manner."
True.
F U
F U too
"F U 3 F U 4 5,76,11"
"7,11."
Sit down.
"I've been waiting long time, kids."
How's the investigation?
Found the Scorpion Yong?
"If he didn't attack us, we wouldn't have lost to him."
I find it strange.
Like someone is leading us in circle.
Does that tattoo guy really exist?
"That message from Lo Keung, is it real?"
What good is it to Lo?
He got us to meet Scorpion Yong.
To have him kill us.
Okay.
Someone's pulling the strings to do it to us.
Good partners.
"I'm hungry, let's eat first."
Waiter!
"Michael, how did you piss off Scorpion Yong?"
What?
He's bringing his men come to you.
How does he know I am here?
"You can pay me, so can he."
How do you know where I am?
Your Lamborghini is hard to miss.
This is my favour to you.
Run now.
I'll take a fucking bar to you!
"Good morning, Father."
"I'm gaining on you, you little fucker!"
"I'll rip your fucking head off, you little bollix."
Oh!
Jesus Christ!
"Tommy, let's just talk about this."
- Be reasonable.
"- Oh, I'll be reasonable."
I'll be very reasonable.
Ha!
"I've got you now, you little shit."
"- You're the one that said ""seize the day!"""
- Seize the day... not me feckin' daughter!
You weren't that bothered two days ago.
She won't even talk to you.
Jesus...
I could kill you!
"Oh, fuck!"
"Oh, shit!"
"Oh, fuck!"
Don't drop me!
"Please, don't drop me!"
Me own fuckin' daughter!
What's so fucking funny?
You!
Us!
Life!
Life... huh?
Is that what you call it?
"Start leading one, instead of following one around."
You're the one who's topping himself.
It's OK.
I am still worried about you.
More than ever.
"Sorry, mom is calling."
"Mom, I'm in Istanbul..."
it's been six months.
I don't know.
"Mom, I'll try to."
"Sure, I am doing fine."
Coffee?
What coffee?
"Oh, I see dad wants some coffee."
"Mom, I have to go now."
Clients...
Bye mom.
"Watch out, God damn it!"
How many have you broken so far.
Enough with your morning tempers.
"Get away from me, you asshole!"
"Auntie, what do you find in that animal?"
That's exactly what I like in him:
The animal in my bed.
Take down those pictures.
I'm sure they drive him crazy.
"Well, he hates me anyway."
He can fuck off...
I'll kick him out soon.
Is this forthe rent?
It's been 9 months and I still don't have a job...
Cavit still asks about you...
"Oh, he is disgusting!"
I wish our motel was still open.
- What kind do you want?
- Mink.
You'll take rabbit and like it.
And that's no...
Am I aggrieved.
"Well, better luck next time."
Mm.
What lovely weather we're having.
"Excuse me, I've gotta see a patient."
- Taxi?
- Uh...
"No, no, uh..."
That dame just dropped this purse.
"- Well, I'll see that she gets it."
"- Uh-uh, uh-uh."
Ha-ha.
"No, I think she'd like me to have it."
[BUZZES]
What is it?
"Yeah, you're the doll."
You dropped this in the Randolph Hotel.
"- I tried to catch you, but you were too fast."
"- Oh, thank you."
I didn't miss it until I got home.
I wondered where I lost it.
"Won't you, uh, come in a minute?"
[CHUCKLES]
Who could say no?
"Oh, it's all there."
All I wanted was the card.
I didn't mean it that way.
"I was looking for a reward for you, but I'm afraid I haven't got enough."
"I was with Chris, I swear."
It's him.
You want to ask him?
You can ask him.
Chris?
Jenna knows everything.
I didn't tell her.
Michael?
Hello?
You don't want me to talk to him?
"Why, is that because you're a lying piece of shit?"
"I didn't do anything wrong, Jenna."
Who is she?
- What are you talking about?
- I want to know who she is.
"You're blowing this way out of proportion, baby."
"Who were you with, Michael?"
This girl I met.
It was nothing.
It was nothing.
This girl I met.
It was nothing.
It was nothing.
Did you have sex with her?
Tell me.
"Did you cheat on me, asshole?"
I kissed her.
"It was one kiss and it meant absolutely nothing, baby!"
I did such a stupid thing!
- It was a stupid thing.
I'm so sorry.
"- You make me sick, you fucking slut."
Abduct the mandible.
- I need to sit down.
- Don't move.
- V-tach.
"- All right, I'm in."
"Let go, Gallant."
- Charge is 200.
- Hyperventilating.
- Sats are 90.
- Clear.
- Sinus rhythm.
"- Okay, full trauma panel."
"C- spine, chest and pelvis."
"Gallant, why don't you go get yourself some air?"
Want a facial CT?
"Yeah, good idea."
Why don't we get a full head series?
Call RT.
Let's get a vent.
"Give him four of Ativan, seven of Pav."
"Nice work, John."
Bet that was a new one.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Look, I'm sorry."
I just thought I was gonna be sick.
It's better if you keep your head down.
It'll be okay.
"It just caught me by surprise, you know?"
Relax.
Take a minute.
"You know, sometimes I don't think I can do this."
Are you gonna call me?
I'll call you.
"Unlock the door, Jenna."
I'm packing.
Come back later.
The house will be empty.
No.
You have to come talk to me.
Things are not going to end like this.
- Like I did this.
Move your foot.
- I panicked.
I made a huge mistake.
Fuck!
"Jenna, open the door!"
Michael?
- Is anything wrong?
- Everything's fine.
I locked myself out.
"- Jenna, you're having our baby!"
"- Yeah, well, maybe I won't keep it!"
"Don't you ever say that, Jenna."
Don't ever say anything like that ever again!
I can do whatever the hell I want.
"We're not married, remember?"
"- We're both free, just like you wanted."
- I made a mistake.
You're right.
"Too late, man."
Move your goddamn foot.
Hi.
"Hi, darling."
"What are you doin', what are you doin'?"
I'm lookin' for some friends of yours.
One of them's a little guy.
"Wears a beret, has a beard."
"The other one's a big, stocky guy."
"Ugly, looks like an animal..."
You know who I'm talking about?
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
- No?
"- No, uh-uh."
Huh... huh?
"Early this morning, a friend of mine got mugged."
I think they did it.
"A black man, this morning?"
You know anything about that?
"No, I don't know anything about it."
"Wait, no, wait... no, no!"
Uh...
now.
Tell me where they are right now.
"Uh, we got a..."
"We got a clubhouse over on barton and throop, on the... on the second floor, okay?"
That's it.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
No...
"If you're lyin', I'll be back."
"No, I'm not lying to you."
[Panting]
I'm not lyin' to you!
[Music playing]
[Group chatter]
But that didn't mean she had to like him.
Franko!
As I live and breathe.
(CHUCKLES)
Franko!
As I live and breathe.
(CHUCKLES)
You don't look a day older.
You don't look a day older.
"I'd give you a big kiss, George,"
"I'd give you a big kiss, George, but these good Richmond folks might get the wrong idea, uh?"
"but these good Richmond folks might get the wrong idea, uh?"
(LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS)
So...
"So... ..how's the gun shop business, uh?"
"..how's the gun shop business, uh?"
Having copper mates never hurts.
Having copper mates never hurts.
A beer?
Or do you want a woggy wine?
Give me a beer.
A beer?
Or do you want a woggy wine?
Give me a beer.
Sure.
Sure.
"What can I do for you, Franko?"
"What can I do for you, Franko?"
You heard I'm looking for someone?
You heard I'm looking for someone?
Thought you might know the right man.
(woman laughing)
- Great tush?
Mike:
Great.
- 'Cause you're a fucking fag.
"- No, I'm not a fag, I just appreciate a great tush when I see one."
"- No offense, Mike, but you are a fag."
- You're a fag.
"- No-- I am not a fag, you're not a fag."
"- Hey, Iâm not-- I'm not a fag."
"- Oh, yeah?"
Prove it.
"- All right, all right, all right."
"All right, he said it 'cause--"
- What?
- He said it 'cause you said it.
He said it 'cause you said it.
- But I'm not a fag.
"- Yeah, no, we know you're not a fag."
"Right, you said it, 'cause you retaliated."
"- Yeah, I said it 'cause you said I was--"
- Right?
- Yes.
"- All right, it's okay, Pete."
- Watch your mouth.
- It's okay.
- You watch my mouth.
- What?
- Nothing.
"- Okay, okay."
"All right, Mike."
"Mike, let me get-- Let me buy you a beer."
It seems there was an argument.
She fell down the stairs.
Potentially a blow to the head before she fell.
Potentially?
- l don't have all the facts yet.
- Is she all right?
"No, she's badly hurt."
Her brain.
They already arrested Albert.
I sent Clay and Sadie down there.
I'll have to go down there myself.
I promised Shannon I'd take her to the Father-Daughter Dance at the club tonight.
"I have no idea how long l'll be with Albert, so--"
"Oh, Dad, Dad--"
"Just drive her over there, and I'll catch up."
- Just drive her there?
"- Yeah, right."
Samantha's case is up.
All right.
Where is he?
I don't know.
Well... she's up.
Um... will you be OK here?
His hotel room is just a block away.
I'll be right back.
I'm late.
Your-- Your dad went home.
"So, um... your ne_ hearing is in 28 days."
OK.
And we will get you moved then.
28 days.
That's when we'll move you.
- Do you guys remember?
- He did.
That was uncomfortable.
- Yeah.
On-stage.
"- But I stopped it, didn't I?"
- There we go.
"- Yeah, he was trying to get me back..."
"Oh, my gosh."
"- But, Mike, I averted your..."
"- Yeah, you did."
We were on stage doing a QA in Toronto and Rafi said:
"""Mike, sing that song that you always sang to me on set."""
And he was getting me back because of this prank we had played on him in Toronto.
He was getting you back for the $20 prank?
"Yes, exactly."
"Oh, I felt..."
I was really...
That was not a good moment.
"And he looked at me, like, the most sadistic look."
"Well, and then he got his, like, Rafi little-kid thing of like:"
"""Mike, you did it to me."""
Hilarious.
"And then I played, like, mom."
I was mom there.
"I was like, ""No."
"Michael does not do it."""
"- Yeah, that was nice."
- Here we go.
Bishop Allen.
"Oh, Mike."
"Oh, yeah, here we go."
Stupid?
I was gonna say sophisticated.
"That's no sophisticated, that's British."
Don't be confused.
Right.
What's he doing in Vegas?
Losing a bet.
Huh?
I bet him I could bring in more money than him in the next 24 hours.
Loser leaves Vegas for good.
"Oh, Sam, are you sure that's wise?"
The guy is a legend.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
You know what I mean.
"I'm the number one casino host in Las Vegas, no matter who my competition is."
Right.
"Anyway, I have an ace up my sleeve, so I can't lose."
An ace?
Mm-hmm.
Mr. Wu.
He plays at least a million a visit.
That sounds like an ace.
Mm-hmm.
"Mr. Wu, hi."
Let's get you to a table.
"I don't think so, Sam."
"Uh, is there a problem?"
I'll say.
You have a ghost?
"Oh, the ghost."
[Chuckles]
That's absurd.
I really want to do well at this job.
I can't do well if everybody thinks that I got my job by sleeping with my boss.
"So if you will excuse me, I am meeting with the EM very shortly..."
- EM?
- It's the executive matchmaker.
Now silence.
Mother.
You want help with that bar?
There you go.
- Hey.
"- Oh, hey!"
You made it.
Yeah.
"I didn't want Major Pain to make me do extra pushups, so I ran here."
- Wow.
"- Hey, you should check them out."
"Oh, yeah."
That...
Nice.
- I got yours in my bag.
- Great.
You need to break them in.
What are you doing tomorrow?
"- Say, around 11?"
- I...
I work.
I'm...
I'm a lawyer.
That's too bad.
"Not that you're a lawyer, that you're not free."
"Well, you know, I work pretty flexible hours."
Cool.
is here.
I put r in the conference room.
You did?
I did.
"No,I did."
- His fianc?
"- Yeah,his fianc?"
.
Tall?
Light brown hair?
Redhead.
Someone has made a huge mistake.
James isn't dead.
He's been writing me letters from iraq.
It's a common name.
"The news said he was born in jackson,pennsylvania."
It's a small town.
That james finn has been dead three months.
He left for iraq three nths ago.
I saw him the morning he went away.
And I just got a letter from him last week.
He says he misses me and he's working a lot.
We'll need those.
"Okay,but I want them back."
It's his handwriting.
I recognize it.
They've been coming for months.
Now I want to know who that other woman is.
We're not here to talk about that.
"Is she saying that she's engad to jimmy,too?"
"'Cause if tt's true, he better hope he's dead,or else I'll kill him."
"James and I connecte on a deep,spiritual level."
Boss.
- What's her name?
The one in green.
- Macarena.
Give her this and another round.
- It's strange.
- What is?
"He's good-looking, he could have any girl."
Why does he do it?
You look tired.
You should go to bed.
"Take the car, I don't mind."
I'll walk back.
Wednesday morning 200 workers with pickets blocked the national highway at four different spots...
- Evening.
- Evening.
I'm coming!
I'm alone.
- Can I come in'?
"- Yeah, sure."
Just a moment.
What can you tell me about this?
- That she has nice tits.
"- It's Carmen, she's dead."
She had nice tits.
- What can I tell you?
- Whatever you know.
- Where did you get it?
- That's not your concern.
- I'm a journalist.
- Don't make me laugh.
- Send it to Madrid.
So you better leave at once!
Down there!
Surround them!
Don't move!
"Daddy, I got the Formula!"
You think my daughter would help you?
Fools!
You'll die in a woman's hands some day.
You didn't kiss me.
"Yoyo, you've tricked me all along."
"Daddy, I want him dead!"
See!
I told you!
Your bad breath gave it away.
"Supermac 1, Yoyo, Robin."
You're done.
Say your prayers!
Ready...!
"Have no fear, there are women about."
More women?
Ha!
There are only men here.
Where are the women?
Sisters!
It's time to get rid of the traitor.
"And prove your loyalty to the country, show yourselves!"
Have you forgotten I'm woman too?
What?
She's a woman?
And I'm 100 percent woman!
"You're really dumb, I'm in front of you for so long."
And you still don't know I am woman!
I haven't been a very good parent.
I know that.
I fucked up.
But I've always loved you.
"You're my baby, man."
Hello?
Yeah.
May I say who's calling?
"You've got a lovely accent, Sara."
Very compelling.
Where are you from?
What a coincidence.
I'm eating a bagel right now.
Hang on.
It's Sara from Israel for you.
-Hey.
-Hi.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
Yeah.
"Yeah, I'm just taking a mental health day."
How is your mental health?
Haven't quite gotten to mine yet.
I'm still dealing with everyone else's.
"It's not true, that thing you said last night."
What thing I said last night?
The thing about my heart.
It's not true at all.
I can't control my heart.
I mean I wouldn't want to even if I could.
-Sara?
-Yeah.
Can I call you right back?
Then her shoes disappear in the light of the lamp.
"It blinds me, so I close my eyes"
and her face is gone.
Thanks for the flowers.
Did you bring me some licorice?
I forgot.
"Daddy, I'm sorry."
Get up and do your exercises.
Yes.
The mice have a picnic on a mountain.
"They lay down a tablecloth, a tray."
Can I have some?
- No.
"It's not for you, it's for the mice."
"Everyone gets some cake, except for the baby, because it's too hard for her."
She only drinks.
Gonki.
"My Gonki, my Gonki."
"It went by fast, huh?"
What am I talking about?
It's over.
I have to put it behind me.
"It's easy for us to say, but for you?"
It's over.
Where's Ora?
Having some tests done.
She couldn't cancel them.
She didn't tell me about any tests.
She said the swelling went down a few weeks ago.
Hello.
"Hello, Daddy."
- Hello.
I need legal help.
We have a suspect who's refusing a cheek swab.
I'll file for a dna search warrant.
What's the name?
Rebecca kemp.
I'll e-mail you the info.
Listen... yomiss working with us?
I think the legal department is more my speed.
"Why,do you miss me?"
"Uh,sure."
Boss... agent lee is getting us our cheek swab.
Rebecca paranoid or guilty?
Might just be angry.
"At finn,us,t world."
"Go back with her to h apartment,get finn's stuff."
"And,no,I don'want to wait for a search warrant."
I'll grab my coat.
Wait at the elevator.
Okay.
"Hey,you."
Where's my money?
"Yeah,you."
Did you and jimmy spend it?
Please get away from me.
I don't know you.
I am jimmy's fiancee.
James loved me.
- He used you.
- You liar!
Chick fight!
He loved me!
get off of me!
- A week?
- Sorry?
A week?
"Yes, that's right."
It strangely matches.
What does?
Cute.
What breed is your dog?
"You see, her appetite for dogs..."
"I mean, her attachment to dogs is strong."
She hates it when others get near her food.
He's a half-breed.
We're raising him for the summer.
I'll be going now.
Do you mime as well?
I'm sure the murderer is one of them.
- Wait!
Wait please!
- You foolish kid!
Please stop!
You can't kill me now.
Why not?
That detective.
He's suspicious of you all.
Suspicious?
He's noticed that you all are foxes.
What?
How do you know that?
By what evidence?
"Yeah, he's lying."
I'm not lying.
Please listen to me.
You're doing your other voice.
"Yes, love, did you notice?"
"Naughty, naughty children!"
RUN!
What do we do?
"Frannie, Frannie, imagine her melting."
What?
!
"In your head, melt her."
I can't!
I'm getting impatient!
You have been VERY naughty!
What about the man?
"You said the man was here, the cloud man."
"Well, he's not, is he?"
Where's the Doctor?
I don't know!
Doctor?
Doctor who?
That's the way to do it!
"Oi, Ow!"
Where did she go?
Will she come back?
"No, don't worry."
She's currently draining through your carpet.
"New setting, anti-freeze, and you're very welcome, by the way."
I'm very grateful.
I knew you'd come.
"No, you didn't, because I don't."
Because this isn't the sort of thing
I do any more.
"Next time you're in trouble, don't expect me to..."
Yours?
I won it.
You won it?
On the horse Mr. Fawlty got a tip on.
"I hope you don't mind, I..."
"No, no, not at all."
"I didn't know you bet on the horses, Polly."
"Oh, I don't."
"Only I was in the town, and I passed the betting shop, and I thought, well, why not?"
"Well, why not indeed?"
"Jolly good question, eh, dear?"
"Pity you didn't let me put something on, really."
You realize how much we would've won?
£75 for a £5 stake.
"Still, you know best."
"Those were the odds, were they, Basil?"
"Yes, that's right, dear."
14-1.
I listened in on the wireless just to make sure it had triumphed.
"Enjoy your winnings, Polly."
Thank you.
Polly.
"Yes, Mrs. Fawlty?"
What was the name of the horse?
The name?
Uh...
I've gone blank.
Birdbrain!
Birdbrain?
"No, no, that came in third."
Uh...
Fishwife!
Out!
- What?
"- Fuck, man."
I can't hang out with you.
Why?
"Because of what you did, Chip!"
You sold out the whole population.
"- Aw, Cooler, come on, man."
"Not you, too?"
- No!
- Of all people.
"- Dude, no."
"Your actions, Chip, they have causes, dude."
"And those causes, there's an effect."
It's about causes and actions.

"Oh, lovely."
"Oh... you are looking more beautiful than ever, mademoiselle."
"Oh, monsieur."
How many men have told you you were beautiful?
"Oh, many, very many, but i pay no attention to them."
Did one ever tell you you were ugly?
No.
You're ugly.

I dealt you a wrong card.
I'm not jim fisk jr.

GEORGE:

He's still got it.
He's still got it.
STEVEN:
Shit.
- Who let that happen?
It's embarrassing.
GEORGE:
Argh!
DEVON:
That is so embarrassing.
What?
Did any of you guys have a chance to get to the store?
"Oh, yeah, no."
"We're good, we got takeout."
"No, I didn't mean for you, I meant f..."
GEORGE:
"All right, here we go."
"- Come on, defense, wake up."
You have to be kidding me.
I just got a little bit more of this I gotta finish.
There's some laundry I'm gonna put away then I had another load of clothes in the dryer.
"I did get some of the food your dad likes, but some healthy stuff too."
"Just, you know."
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be okay.
[CAR ALARM CHIRPS]
[HAMMERING]
Bend your knee a little bit more.
"- No, ma'am, i'm not here to take anything."
I'm here to bring something back.
Just sign right here and i'll bring it in.
I don't have any money.
I didn't order anything.
You of all people should know that.
"Ma'am, it's already been taken care of."
Just sign and i'll bring the stuff in.
"It's got my name and address on it, baby."
"Well, bring it on."
"All right, fellas, move it in."
Come on.
- What?
- What is this?
"Oh, it's your furniture."
Oh my goodness.
How did this happen?
- Who did...
"Mama, thank you."
"- Oh, i didn't do it,"
But i'll take the hug.
I need one about now.
"Mama, this is all our furn..."
"Marcus, you did this."
"Baby, thank you."
"Sorry, babe, i wish i could take the credit,"
But i didn't have anything to do with it.
"Well, then who did this?"
How did this happen?
"It was me, mama."
- Monica?
- You?
"No, they ran out, so they used 2 percent."
"- Oh, my God!"
- Okay.
Come on!
"Oh, my God!"
"Come on, baby."
Do it.
Do what you have to.
Okay.
"Here, sweetie."
My God!
How dare you?
"I specifically asked for skimmed... and you bring me this fatty, moogeous cow loyd?"
"I'm sorry, I'm so, so sorry, it's just you're so thin!"
Don't patronize me!
Get this out of here.
Clean it up now.
Did you get my husband on the phone?
The hotel said he checked out.
Can't you do anything right?
Call again!
- I tried three times.
- Did you ask for the right name?
It's.
"De la Paix, I'm sure you got it wrong."
De La Paix It's not that hard.
I'm certain that I said it right.
The hotel specifically said that Mr. And Mrs. De la Paix... checked out.
"Jocelyn, I'm so terribly sorry for the way I behaved."
I'm off to London for a week.
It's my father's birthday.
I'll see you at the Return Bash.
"Driving back, he saw you driving in front of him with Byron in the car."
Where had you and Byron been at 4:00 a.m.?
We've been here all night.
June's mixed up.
He's old.
He don't see so well.
-I'll make the bastard talk!
-He won't talk.
It's his sister.
Can I speak to the boy?
-How are you this morning?
-Fine.
-Pretty sleepy?
-I guess so.
-You go out with Uncle Ronnie last night?
-No.
You sure?
-You didn't see a pretty lady?
-No.
You sure?
-Did Uncle Ronnie tell you to say that?
-Yeah.
So this has just been pretend?
What do you say we stop playing pretend and play really?
And you really should spend a night in jail.
So you can tell your sister.
You got to let me go.
"I can't do that, Lila."
You can't let them put me in jail.
What's going to happen to our baby with me in jail?
Your mom will keep taking care of him.
I'll give her money for him.
You made it.
"How about that, kiddo?"
Excuse me.
Are you the parents of the little boy in the tunnel?
How does it feel to know that Mercy was three minutes--?
Excuse me.
I think you'd better leave.
"Sorry, I'm talking with these people."
"No, you're not."
"Hey, how are you feeling?"
- You made it.
- Just like you promised.
- Thank you.
- It's all right.
You remember Wrigley Field.
We got a date.
Sit down.
Let me finish.
- That one was crooked.
- Yeah?
Next time you can do it yourself.
"- Hey, Mark, thanks."
- For what?
You did all the hard work.
I don't think I could've gone up in that helicopter.
I just got lucky.
No.
You know about kids.
As good as new.
- Where are you going?
- Check for reporters.
All clear.
Uh...
"Thanks, big man."
It really looks beautiful.
I'm sorry about earlier.
Please don't smoke in the house.
Roman.
You want one?
No.
You know I promised Ryan.
What's that?
Paper?
It's cute.
# No I can't save you

Things get too busy on the couch to call?
I was doing something for my brother.
Oh yeah?
Am I gonna meet this brother of yours?
It's not likely.

My Mom would have loved you.
"Well, of course."
You said she had good taste.
"You know, you can't ever leave me."
No matter how bad a wife I am.
You're a perfect wife.
Liar.
"Look, you got to trust me, okay?"
Everything's going to be just fine.
"Hi, there."
I'm Judy.
Who are you?
Becca.
You're the lady on TV.
"Stay here, Becca."
We'll be right back.
I brought your phone back.
You haven't played the message on TV yet.
I will.
I made a copy.
"Mrs. Jerome, I have to ask you one more time."
Where did your daughter go when she disappeared 12 years ago?
I already told you.
I don't know.
This may be important.
I'll tell you what's important.
Everyone believes Jeffrey's a victim in this.
I need them to hear my daughter.
"Look, I've called the hotline, like, five times."
Why the hell hasn't anyone called me back?
!
You know what?
Forget it.
Don't bother.
"Hey, you seen Nicky?"
She'll show up.
Don't worry.
"Come on, Peter, we gotta go."
Are you in or are you out?
Wait.
Hold up.
Coach.
"Sorry, I was in the shower."
No problem.
I'll let you out over there.
"Hey, thanks for working with me today."
"Oh, you're welcome."
You're just getting started.
"I feel like I'm not normally that bad, though."
- It's those fucking nerves.
- Everybody gets them.
Is there anything to do around here?
- Do?
Like what?
- I don't know.
Go grab a drink or something.
I don't feel like staying home.
You want to grab a drink with me?
We could do that.
We could do that.
Let's not.
You're a talented fighter.
You have my attention.
"- No, I didn't mean that."
"- Oh, I know."
See you tomorrow.
Good work.
[Both moaning]
"Oh, my gosh."
That was so good.
You are fucking insane.
"I picked-up names,"
"Fill Dill, Cill, Guill, Dill, Hill, Trill ..."
Okay.
I've got it.
And will one-up Will.
-Good for you.
We could get our own school.
We are males.
-We adopts.
"-Takes you, I fit."
I have much to do.
"Okay, then can go, go quench your thirst for blood."
The many other Krills at sea.
Many would appreciate Krills have me as a partner.
I'm a hell of a partner.
You're the only school I have.
"You know that, but no intimacy."
-Are you hurt?
"No, I'm fine."
-I'm fine.
"-What is Seymour, gimme a break."
"No, no, Thank you, brother."
My kids are out there.
"Then, no!"
"Erik and Atticus, to hide."
Let's hide here.
"Rolls, rolls, rolls, where I can fly!"
"Look, My favorite penguins trapped a wall of ice."
Let's do a rotation.
-Forever.
Never seen so many seagulls in one place.
"Stay together, do not differ."
- I wrote it.
- What?
In these couple of days?
"Yeah, I think it's pretty good."
These two pages.
How'd you finish so quickly?
Amazing.
Do you like it?
"Don't know, maybe tomorrow it'll look like shit to me."
But it all came within a few hours.
"Funny, huh?"
"It came out so easy, as if I were possessed."
"Yes, Director Kim."
How are you?
I'm home.
Are you still there?
How's your leg?
It still hurts.
I think I was afraid again.
I miss you.
"I'm sorry, too."
Honestly.
When are you coming back?
I think I liked you a lot as a movie director.
And I think you'll have a hard time because of me.
Please stop.
You think so?
Should I try to find someone here who resembles you?
Like you did?
"Yeah, why don't you."
Don't worry.
I won't.
-Yeah.
-Completely?
-Completely.
That gets me off.
You're easy.
No.
With you I am.
So do I get to...?
Do I get to work on you for a while or do we just fall asleep?
You can work on me all night long.
"I mean, you're with someone."
Why would I let myself fall in love with you?
"What, like I'm just an object to you?"
"I'm just, like, a piece of ass?"
-You just looking to get laid?
-Yeah.
Right.
"-God, you're like a girl."
"-Oh, thanks."
That's really flattering.
"Yeah, it is."
Maybe that's why I like you.
Are you having a sexuality crisis?
No.
I'm not having any kind of crisis.
"You're lucky, you know that?"
No.
I don't know that.
Why am I lucky?
You can control your heart.
"-Hey, thanks for coming out, Darla."
-Good night.
And he's one of your best friends.
Mm-hmm.
Why don't you pursue him?
I always liked him.
I'm just not good at pursuing a guy.
"HALLIE, I'm sorry if I made you feel..."
jealous.
"I mean, I never, never meant to."
I never even knew I did.
"I guess I just feel the way you felt with J.P., you know?"
Yeah.
I understand that.
The next morning as soon as she woke up
Jill took a cab straight home to face the music.
Not knowing if that music...
would be a wedding march.
Drew.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I love you.
I really do love you.
"Me, too."
Smell my hair.
Does it still smell like cigarettes?
No.
It smells like Jill.
Ugh.
Wow.
Look at this.
"Party at our place, and it's only 9am."
"Last night, she was wearing the ugliest pair of cotton granny panties"
I've ever seen in my entire life.
They did an in-service.
I got it.
"'Kay, let's take a look."
Sats down to 92.
- Turn on the suction.
- It's on.
"- No, it's not."
- I have it on high.
I'm not getting anything here.
"Inez, go next door and help Dr. Lockhart with the chest tube."
I'm not allowed to work with any of the nurses now?
The patient is paralyzed.
I can't see the cords.
- I need suction.
- Hold your horses.
Suction container wasn't sealed properly.
You're welcome.
Tube.
Found it.
Two units on the infuser.
Set up for a subclavian.
"Okay, bag him."
- End tidal CO2 is yellow.
- Yellow's good.
I'll be right back.
"All right, hook me up."
O-silk is next?
- O-silk.
Come on.
- Here you go.
And I want to auto-transfuse this guy.
You need a side collector on the thoraseal.
It's too hard on my ego.
"Either way, it felt to get out and get some exercise."
"While you're in the shower, I'll scramble some eggs"
And make some of my special pancakes.
Pancakes for me?
And for me.
Something to restore that energy we've burned out.
JEFF:
Only if you got lots of honey.
My wallet.
I left it at the court.
I hooked it on the chain-link fence.
I'm so stupid.
No problem.
We'll just walk back.
"No, I'll go back."
You stay here with Greta.
It'll be faster.
JEFF:
"OK, Greta."
That's try to stay awake while she's gone.
[Greta whimpers]
"Yes, you're a good dog, Greta."
[Ambient growling]
[Choking]
Jeff!
No!
Jeff!
Jeff!
Jeff!
[Sobbing]
[Wailing]
Is that her mother?
I say yes.
And who's that Ghena?
Why does it smell of wine here?
What wine?
We had a drink with Mashka.
Today is her birthday.
We went to a cafe with the girls.
One bottle of champagne for the 5 of us.
"You do remember Mashka, don't you?"
"We came with her last year, remember?"
A little blond one.
- What have you got on your head?
- Grandma's present.
Take it off.
Grandma's present is for winter.
Go to your room.
Get away from the jam with your spoon!
Go to your room!
Lay off me!
"Oh, what great caviar I cooked!"
"Taste it, daughter."
I don't want it now.
"- Taste it now, I said!"
"- Come on, mama..."
Why does Irishka say that I got a big nose?
Is it really big?
That's how they joke now.
I wish you heard what she says to me.
And who is that Ghena?
Ghena is my colleague.
We work together.
"- Got your own John Dillinger, huh?"
"- Yeah, and, like, Capone too."
Be it ever so humble.
"Yeah, where is Miss Sexy Feet?"
She's in that nest over there.
"Oh, well, you go on."
I'll wait here and observe.
Not like this.
This has to be done right.
Come on.
"Well, I see you've cleaned this up."
"Oh, yeah."
"Here, why don't you have a seat over here, Jon?"
"- No, thanks."
- You want a cold drink?
- Yeah.
What do you got?
- Let me see.
Got a little apple juice and a piece of watermelon left over from the Fourth.
July Fourth?
"- Well, this is almost..."
"- Yeah, I know."
It's a little dried out.
I'll pass.
"You know, I could do it like in the movies."
I could walk over and borrow a cup of sugar or flour.
"Yeah, if you could find a cup."
Are you kidding?
I know where everything is in here.
Lucky it was that pole and not my leg.
"Now, what do you think?"
Sugar or flour?
- Hello?
- It's me.
You ready?
"Listen, tell Michael not to let the sauce stick."
Keep stirring it.
- Henry says don't let the sauce stick.
- I'm stirring it.
"- Listen, you know what to do?"
"- Yeah, yeah."
"Don't ""yeah, yeah"" me, Lois."
This is important.
Make sure you leave the house when you make the call.
You understand me?
You hear me?
Call from an outside line.
I mean it.
"Jesus, you must think I'm dumb."
Why are you bugging me?
I know what to do.
"You little hick, just make sure you do it."
You can be such a pain.
- Hey!
Just do it!
- Okay.
Un-fucking-believable.
All of them.
Every fucking girl in my life.
- What did he say?
- Nothing.
What does she do after she hangs up with me?
After everything I told her?
"After all her ""yeah, yeah"" bullshit?"
It's the weed capital of the world!
- No.
- Put the bong away!
"- Take the inaugural hit, dude."
- No!
"Come on, man."
- Then I'm gonna do it.
- Put it away.
Put the frickin' bong away.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Turb--
Terrorist!
Roldy?
- What the fuck is that thing in his hands?
"- No, ma'am, not a terrorist."
- He's just an idiot.
- This is just a bong.
He said he got a bomb!
"No, people, it's a water pipe for tobacco."
"No, no, no, it's not a bomb."
It's just a bong.
Poison gas!
It's marijuana!
Marijuana!
"You picked the wrong plane, you terrorist fuck!"
Hey!
"Hey, what are you doing?"
There are three air marshals on board.
Three!
We are not terrorists!
"Sir, that's a bong, not a bomb."
I can't get my bearings.
You need a stiff drink.
Come on.
Let's go get a drink.
BALLROOM
These things still go on!
Anyway...
Where'd that guy go with my suitcase?
- You got conned.
So they stole that too.
Now I have nothing left.
Oh well.
At least you can't lose anything that way.
"Well, well."
Biberkopf!
You've been gone a long time.
A beer and two patties.
Coming up.
- Wait.
- What?
Let me.
So you help out here?
No male admirers around?
"- No, none."
"- In that case, another beer."
Cheers.
Who's that with Cilly?
"A beer driver, maybe."
Can't believe she'd go for that type.
His name's Biberkopf.
I know him from before.
Just out of prison.
Get away.
"Give me, what I need now is this."
I'll go to the ladies!
She recovered even before putting it on!
Must be very potent?
Darling!
Wait for me here!
Don't go away. I'll go put some on.
Save some for me!
The Formula is in the smallest tooth-brush.
Burglar...!
Stop drinking.
You'll get drunk!
I've been sober these last 3 years.
Useless!
Has he ever been sober?
You again?
Don't stand there.
I'd never ask you to dance.
I feel like dancing with someone handsome!
Me?
"Sam, the record's stuck!"
"Watch it, don't get fresh!"
It's you who's getting fresh.
Damn you!

- Me too!
How much does Fat Pig pay you?
Such awful taste!

I'll go with Chloe on that one.

"I can't, Seth."

It's very easy.
Go on.
Just go.
I'm not going to go alone.
"We need help, man."
I need help.
"Just sit me down, okay ?"
All right.
"Okay, but I'm going to come right back."
I know.
Do you hear that ?
No.
Exactly.
It's quiet now.
Maybe they moved on.
Or... maybe they're just faking us out.
There we go.
Locked and loaded.

You better get some good rest tonight.
It's these the hard shifts.
"I had some bad news this morning, Miss."
My Jim's missing.
Oh!
Try not to worry.
I'm sure he'll turn up.
Oh!
"I do hope so, Miss."
I expect I'll feel better when I have cuppa tea.
That's right.
It's finishing time now.
A million bullets for dispatch by the morning!
?
But I tell you the girls have done 10 hours today already.
Yes.
I hear myself urgently.
But you expect these girls to run 14 hours on stretch.
Alright!
I'll ask them.
She doesn't have to ask us.
A million bullets by the morning!
Alright!
"Come on girls, it's gotta be done!"
Stop!
Stop there.
Stop right there.

"You're a pervert, Sid."
You need to get help.
I know.
"Right, we have a big case to solve, something you're not going to have to worry about now, eh?"
No.
Big cases and police work.
"Sleet, don't say that."
I'm really bad at breaking bad news.
"Yeah, yeah, no fucking joke!"
That's why I thought I'd get you to do it.
"Yeah, really fucking funny!"
"OK, I, I'm sorry, Sid."
"Be careful, yeah?"
Are we going now?
"Yeah, we go."
Come on.
"We'll just leave him here, he'll be fine."
Good luck.
Thanks.

Sorry.

Mmm.
I'm sorry that I can't think of a thing to be sorry about.
Ohh!
I suppose you've got friends and relatives back in the states.
No.
My husband's all I had.
- Why do you ask?
- Because we got a proposition to make.
Yes?

We've known all along.

What do you think?
6th to constitution?
This time of day I'd take 9th.
"Yeah, you're right."
Want to grab a beer after we drop off these two jokers?
"Ah, I can't. in-laws are in town."
"Hey, hey, hang on."
I want to pull over
And grab a paper.
They'll be fine.
"Before you say anything,"
I know that I mangled this.
I know I ran in there impulsively
Without--without thinking--without my bag--
Because I had a bigger--someone dug you up.
Oh.
So you know.
It's Macpherson.
I'm right.
"Yes, I'm afraid you are."
Now it's up to you to stop him.
Thank you.
Don't move!
"So, Mr. Ogawa, when does he get here?"
"Oh, God."
It works.
"- Hello, Arthur."
- James.
Good to see you after all these years.
To concentrate for a few days.
"I see, where to?"
There's this town called Shinduri.
On the west coast.
But I heard a sandstorm's on its way.
And it's supposed to be nasty.
- Sandstorm?
Again?
"- Yes, a nasty one, too."
So why don't you wait a couple of days and then go?
I have a strange feeling about today.
Okay.
"Well, I'll work hard on it."
"Producer Jung, everything's fine with you, too?"
"So, do you still have some money left for expenses?"
"Ah, yes."
A little.
"Later perhaps, you can..."
Thank you.
"Well, take care."
Good luck with your script.
- Thank you.
- Bye.
- Sit here!
"- No, the backseat's fine."
"- Please, sit here."
"- No, I'm okay."
Hello.
We're off.
"Wow, it's a new car."
Really nice.
Did you pay for it?
"- Yes, no, yes."
"- Come on, come on."
"Yes, yes, oh yes."
All right.
I've deliberated.
No retrial.

"I said, order!"
Order in this court.
There will be order.

You're always working or at school.
Or sleeping.

Your personal bridge?

How's the invalid?
Who?
You still ask who?
It's obvious.

How many cooks does she have?
They're not her cooks.
The soup is an offering.
All right.

Stealing is bothering.
Nobody steals anything on my shift.
Yeah!
Wha... we've been locked in here all day.
I don't buy it.
"I don't buy it, either."
I think I know who likes chocolate.
Everybody.
"Yes, right."
But especially kids.
I heard this one say she wants to put her face and her feet in it.
I stand by that.
It's gotta be in here somewhere.
Would you be dumb enough to hide it in here?
"I guess you're dumb enough to think we would hide it in there, Ethan."
"Yeah, you gorgeous idiot."
Or maybe you kids hid it in the bathroom.
Whew...!
"Eh, maybe give it a minute in there."
It's not in there.

"Yeah, well we got a fuckin' gun."
Why don't we use it?
There's only one bullet.
"Riley, how many bullets did you bring?"
"Well, you only need one bullet to take 'em out, right?"
Technically that's true.
So here's the plan.
No way.
Guns and Riley don't mix.
Will you stop insulting my crew?
"You guys, no new plans."
"We stay together, and we find the jammer, okay."

- [boys] where?
I had a contact with him.
You...
You calling on the spirits?
Shh.
- She's weird.
- She's creepy.
I...
I ain't too sure I wanna meet this Tony.
Shh!
They've got a gym...
"Come on, Mom."
Please.
This is ridiculous.
It's what I chose to do.
I'm going to find a place soon.
- And you really think you can start over?
- You mean at my age?
"- Yes, yes I do."
"- I'm still breathing, aren't I?"
I'm still here.
It's a long time ago.
Daddy'll understand.
"No, that's..."
That's not the point of this.
You've been together since college.
Yup.
And do you know how miserable I've been almost the whole time?
- I don't think that's true.
"- Well, I've just kept it from you."
"Yeah, trust me, Mom, you're not that good at hiding your emotions."
Really?
I'm sorry.
You make this difficult because you want it that way.
Men are easy.
"And you've been with Michael, what,"
"- three years, right?"
- Yeah.
And it took me less than half an hour to figure him out.
- Wow.
"Oh, you're lucky."
Jeez.
See?
We haven't got a proper officer so we get pushed about like potboys.
He's not a proper officer.
Never seems to tire.
Hard to catch him off guard.
"He let you off light, Sharpe, back in the village."
So why so hard?
"He's just not right, Cooper."
He's not happy being an officer.
And mark my words he'll bring us bad luck
We'll do it tomorrow.
In the mountains.
Vale.
The fire's started.
Prepare to fight
Down
Get down!
Or I'll kill him
Rifles!
To me!
"Oh, my God."
"Young Perkins, sir."
Not a sound.
No!
No!
"Perkins, I want you to protect this pennant with your life."
"Yes, sir."
"Never say die, Perkins."
"Never again, sir."
They'll be back for them two.
Up!
Keep moving!
"Sergeant Beecham shoved that junkie into a lamp post and he said, ""I'll keep you posted""?"
"Oh, yeah."
I heard about that.
"Yeah, everybody heard about it."
"I mean, people were repeating it."
It was famous.
This is even better.
This is a classic.
If you say so.
"Yeah, I just need to pick the right moment."
Captain?
"If you're ready to release the body,"
I can take her downtown.
Okay.
I still don't get it.
Who would want to kill the lotto girl?
I guess her number came up.
Hey!
What are you doing?
"Hey, what are you doing?"
"That was my line, man."
What are you talking about?
I just said the exact same thing two seconds ago.
Ask the Captain.
"Randy, this is a crime scene."
For God's sakes...
No.
You heard me.
Yeah.
You know what?
He must have heard me.
Huh?
"Uh, is everything okay today?"
Why wouldn't it be?
No reason.
"So, what do you want to lay down today?"
"Uh, no."
No bets.
I'm just going to cool it today.
Thanks.
So why did you call me?
"Uh, shit."
"I got to go, Ivan."
I'll talk to you later.
So what does that mean?
"It means we wait 10 hours, figure out what the hell's happening."
"Babe, can we talk?"

"Hey, Ivan."
What a surprise.
"I was wondering why you showed up tonight, and then it occurred to me."
It's probably 'cause I called you like a paranoid fucking idiot.
(HITS WALL)
"Hey, Ivan."
What a surprise.
What are you doing?
He's going to be here soon.
You can't leave me alone.
"Well, I'm not in the picture, so, send me a text message when it's done?"
"Well, I-"
"I'm not in the photo either, so... maybe I should leave too?"
- l gave all that to Missing Persons.
"Okay, mister."
Okay.
"I'll handle this, Willie."
"Thanks, Willie."
- Fished this one out of the Gulf.
- Pass.
- Hit and run.
"- No, he's too old."
- What'd he look like?
- Medium.
- Medium what?
"- Medium young, medium height."
- Medium weight.
- Very illuminating.
"You can call him medium, what's left of him."
Barracuda got the rest.
That's the lot.
- All the rest empty?
- Yeah.
Not much business f or the one cool spot in town.
"- One just came in, but he don't fit."
- How do you know?
- You said suicide.
- l was guessing.
This one came f rom a car smash.
You don't want to see him.
- l might as well blanket the field.
- He's as crisp as bacon.
- l can stand it if you can.
- Okay.
He was like a lump of charcoal.
Sats 88.
He's not talking anymore.
Why is he not talking?
Because he can't.
Let's Betadine the whole chest just in case.
- You need any help?
- Yes.
With his wife.
She's bleeding.
- I'm not his wife.
- Then you shouldn't be here.
- Where's the rapid infuser?
- Got it.
We need that blood.
Let's get her on a monitor.
She refused treatment for chest pain at the scene.
I'm Dr. Kovac.
Come with me.
- No.
Somebody needs to be with him.
"- Okay, I'm in."
- Hook me up.
- Let us take care of him and Dr. Kovac will take care of you.
Please.
What are you doing down there?
"Lewis, what are you doing up there?"
This guy's got no DP pulse.
It's called a trauma assessment.
"Lungs clear, chest tones normal."
- Got the Doppler.
- Give it to me.
- Sweet Jesus!
Men without bikes.
"Oh, boy."
"Waltzer, Waltzer, look, don't worry."
"Your cut's waiting for you, that's right."
Relax.
Relax.
"Look, I tell you what..."
-Ow!
-Right.
"Look, if you don't get all of your dough, feel free to kill me."
"What do I look like, huh?"
A Laundromat?
A slot machine?
'Cause I am not a slot machine.
You are a slot machine.
"Step right up here, folks, there's a winner every minute."
Sorry.
"Oh, what, l-I hurt your feelings?"
No.
"No, and you want to know why?"
'Cause you don't got no feelings.
"Yes, I do."
"I'm a person, and I have feelings."
"Oh, ho, you're a person now."
"Hey, she's not a person, is she, Betty?"
"Yeah, she sort of is."
Nobody's talking to you.
"You know what the test is, baby?"
"If you were a person, you could do whatever you want..."
Ow.
"and you can't, 'cause you do whatever I tell you to do, isn't that right, Betty?"
Y eah.
And she got her head chopped off
So her daughter Elizabeth made a vow never to marry a man.
She married her country.

"You walked away, Sam."

"- Stop it, both of you."
"You're the one who said, ""don't come back,"" dad."
"You're the one who closed that door, not me!"
This is never the life that I wanted for you.
"Look, I'm sure dad would have been here if he could."
She's such a slut.
So?
"Personally, I'm very pro-slut."
"What happened, anyway?"
"She totally banged Jamie Jaffe, that's what."
She gave him the reverse cowgirl and everything.
"Hi, Taylor."
How was your weekend?
"Fine, I guess."
You didn't... go to the rodeo?
That's my spot.
Sorry.
This is a skeev-free zone.

You're sorry?
Please listen to me.

I'm on your side.
I'm on the president's side.
I can tell you where the guerrilleros are.
I saw them marching towards San Juan.
We'll see about that.

We need more material.
Hurry up.
"You need to work faster, come on."

There's someone lying there.
Let's see if he's still alive.
Careful.
There's another one down there.
Fire!
There are even more of them!
Come over here!
I always come at the right time.
Where's Smithy?
He stayed down there.
I lost sight of him.
It all happened so fast.
- Do you think he's dead?
"- If he isn't, I hope they won't get him."
"- Come on, get up there."
- Hurry up.
Come on.
I wonder what your father would have said about this ruckus.
Don't mention it.
Thank you very much.
Pay my mother.
Thank you very much.
Don't mention it.
Good-bye.
Good luck.
How much do I owe you?
Three hundred tomans.
- Here.
- You're welcome.
Thank you again.
Good-bye.
Why did you take the money?
Go and give it back to him.
He wanted to pay.
Sir...
You're our honoured guest.
No.
Keep it.
Thank you very much.
Really.
You honour us.
Thank you again.

What if he's sick?
He'd be whining.
He always whines when he's sick.
You two really suck at whispering.
"Believe it or not, I can hear you."
And I'm not sick.
"Every once in a while, I just need to power down."
Be still.
Reflect on this little trip through the cosmic rip.

I need to find my deep calm.
"Yeah, he's sick."
Yeah.
Let's check for a fever.
What is this?
Last year's performance appraisal review.
Hah!
How did you get this?
The NCIS fairy left it under my pillow.
What do you think?
You stole it?

Shut up!
He has to sit on the wall all day and do nothin'.
"You go and shite you, you stupid bitch... what?"
"Don't you ""what"" me, Sonny Curley."
No language like that in this house.
- Exactly!
"- Don't start, you."
- You never hit her!
- I do so!
I'm not taking this!
Have a nice day!
You better watch yourself... or you'll find yourself... packing your shampoo and spot creams.
"I'm sorry, you'll have to discuss it with my solicitor."
Don't you start.
Now...
Sharon has a bit of news for yous.
I can't help it.
"I'm sorry, Sharon."
"Go on, love."
I'm going to have a baby.
"- That's massive, Sharon."
- Is that all?
"Women, what?"
Right.
Where's your bump?
- Also why would we die?
- Can I interrupt for a second?
I just want to say that I love both of you guys.
Trent more than I did before.
OK.
"Well, just so you know, I hate both of you."
Do you want any oil before we start?
No.
"Please, I... that wasn't in the script."
Sounds like we're ready to go.
Let's get started.
Ah.
"Three, two, one."
Hit it!
None of my moves are sexual.
I apologize.
- Wow!
"- Yeah, wow."
That was an amazing story.
"Hey, Danny."
You have to tell us if you got the ring back when you get back from the bathroom.
"Hey, yeah."
OK.
Just give me a few seconds.
- Flashbacks are exhausting.
"- Hell, yeah."
So look.
The stripper scouts turned out that they loved us.
And so did the audience.
So...
Anyway.
"OK, well."
That too without a weapon.
"Baby, in this life, I am the tiger."
Got it?
I'll bite if someone tries to touch me.
- Tiger?
- Yes.
- There you go.
- Thanks.
Let's go.
What?
"Everything's set, right?"
"Yes, everything is set."
I'll take a plane and go straight to Budapest.
From there I'll go to the embassy and then I'll come to get you.
"Otherwise, you'll get stuck in the water."
And no one has seen my face so there is nothing to worry about.
Everything will be...
- You are scared.
- Very scared.

I too am scared.
- You look after yourself in the boat.
- I will.
We will take Lord's name.

She is You.

"You take care of yourself, got it?"
You are my life.
Let's go?
I'm just letting you know.
"Okay, 10-4."
"Hop in, boys."
We got to make a stop before we head to the Malcolm place.

Goddamn it.

Settle down.
"Harlan, goddamn it."

You calm down now.
Let go of me.
"You want to take a ride with me, huh?"
You want to take a ride with me?
"He laid out all night drinking, Hurricane."
Okay.
What are those men doing here?
"They're not here to take him away, are they?"
It's okay.
She locked me out.
I understand.
"I understand, I understand."
"Now look, you laid out all night drinking and you knew she was going to do this, didn't you?"
Yeah.
"You say you're sorry, I'll bet she'll let you in."
LUREEN:
He knows I will.
We'll go to church on Sunday and he'll feel a whole lot better.
You won't let them take him away?

It's not worth it.

- Whose money are you using?
"- Yours, thank you very much."
But our money belongs to us again.
What's the idea?
Remember our bet?
"You see, you didn't get married."
- I'll pay you later.
- No.
All aboard!
- But I've got to get that train.
- You mean you had to get it.
"You know, you didn't win that lucky quarter."
I'll flip you for a ticket to New York.
I don't want to go to New York.
He doesn't want to go to New York.
"Goodbye, Lucky, old boy."
So long.
"- Goodbye, Lucky."
- See you later.
"Give my regards to the folks, will you?"
Say hello to Aunt Lucy.
So long.
"Goodbye, Lucky."
"Lucky, here's your suitcase."
Here's your toothbrush.
"Boy, I'd give my life for a smoke."
"- Well, take the quarter."
"- No, sir, not the lucky one."
Wait a minute.
I'll get a smoke.
"I beg your pardon, have you got a match, please?"
Thank you.
I'm okay!
No need to be worry!
"I'd rather be the one who git hit, instead of you getting hurt!"
Do you know how afraid I was?
"How come you are still like a child, playing these?"
I haven't played them for a long time.
What a beautiful necklace!
I think I saw it somewhere.
It's nothing!
Get back!
"Xiamu, do you have a girlfriend?"
No!
Give it back to me!
- Tell me about her!
"- No, I swear!"
Give it back!
"Obviously you bought it for the girl you like, stop quibbling!"
I don't have any girlfriend!
Xiamu!
I... like you!
"Xiamu, it's only your sense of dependence."
I have been treating you like my brother.
Don't talk to me!
Keep it on your neck!
Ah...
Why are we here?
Surprise!
Are you?
It was joking!
Hello?
My dear!
Have you lunch yet?
You must work faster than this.
Okay.
Day 3
"Isn't this going overboard, bro?"
Your body might fall apart.
It's okay.
I've been up for 5 days before.
Kai.
I'm really thankful that you told me to work.
It really works.
Shit.
My head is so heavy.
Day 4
Yoon.
You accepted the job from Peng?
Yeah.
You know the scale of that job is 2 months of work.
You've only got 2 weeks.
And you accepted it!
Yeah.
You know even though I...
"I didn't screen it, you should have known better."
Why did you take it?
Peng always takes advantage of people.
You're the only one who looks up to him.
You know when he said that you're the first person he thought of.
He lied!
You know that?
"At least someone thinks of me, Je."
"Thought of you, that's f*cked up."
He only cares about his job.
So he sweet talked you into taking this job.
"I was there, sure."
Boy postured like he's seasoned.
Feels light.
Which would mean a lot if you were a scale.
Do you want it or no ?
Now it is light.
I'm losing my patience.
$800 or the deal is off.
Deal's off.
I'm out of here.
"See, there's a problem with your story, Julio."
"What, no happy ending ?"
"No, whoever shot Bob left evidence of their gun on him."
Okay.
"Look, I brought an associate with me."
"New guy, loose cannon,"
"- name of Luis, Luis Rivera."
- And Luis shot Bob ?
You ask him.
"Until we find Luis, Julio, we're going to hang onto you."
"Step over to the car, please."
"Let's go, Julio."
Right over here.
Let's go.
Eric !
I don't see anyone.
"Shift into Plan ""B""."
Luis Rivera hold up.
"Luis, you got to change up your routine, man."
I didn't do nothing wrong.
"Yeah, you wake up, and you're already wrong."
Let's get him up.
I burned them.
Sorry?
I burned them.
He burned them.
Where?
Where?
In the kitchen.
In the kitchen.
Bastard!
YOu!
What did you come here to do?
What did you come here to do?
Ask him again.
What did you come here to do?
To travel.
"To travel, he says."
Tell him I'll throw him in jail if he doesn't fess up.
Tell us the truth.
"Even if I told you, you wouldn't believe me."
He says you wouldn't believe him.
"Look, you translate everything I say,"
- word for word.
"- Yes, sir."
You fucking prick!
Oh...
"You loose-assed, dog-fucking son of a whore!"
"So, uh..."
What kind of tourist hangs pictures of dead people on his wall?
Travel... the dead...
Why was this in your house?
HOW did this...?
Who the fuck are you?
She drove off.
She's not rational.
Tell me the truth.
She's upset.
"Um, are you still with her?"
"Look, I told you..."
I told you we were having problems.
Are you still with her?
"All this time, you were... ..you were just lying to me about being separated."
"Technically, she was in Melbourne, I was here."
"Oh, my God."
I...
I just wanted to be with you.
"Oh, my God."
"OK, I can explain everything."
Do you know what?
Don't even bother.
Because I can see that the next word out of your mouth is gonna be a lie.
"OK, Grace, let's just be grown-up about..."
Just get out.
Let's be grown-up...
Just get out!
You heard her.
Hm?
"Now, you have fun."
That is an order.
You're going to enjoy bossing everyone around in Singapore?
Too soon to be funny.
Be happy.
Mwah.
"Rio awaits, and I've got a meeting at the office to get to."
"Oh, I'll miss you."
"Franz, let us wear our old clothes and..."
- What else happened?
- Nothing!
Where did you first meet him?
On the streets?
"And I drive around, risking my life!"
You're a whore!
Leave me alone!
You whore!
I risk my life and work so hard!
Get out of my apartment!
Leave me alone!
Open the door!
It's my apartment!
Out!
Get out of here!
But I saved your life!
Get out!
Scoundrel!
Get out!
Out!
"Yes, she's so soft and faithful!"
I was on the verge of killing you.
Just like Ida.
I wanna be a decent man but it's so hard.
We just remain in the gutter.
"I'm going to drive to the countryside, I can't stand it here anymore."
"We still have a lot to do out there, in Weißensee."
Revenge.
Ede and Biberkopf gotta come along.
"- So, you're taking Franz with you?"
- Yes.
"No, come on."
Already?
[Laughs]
Whoo!
"Now, do me a favor."
I want you to move around with her a little bit.
See if she's worth a shit.
Come on.
"Aye, aye, captain."
This is a fucking good burger.
Did you make this?
I'm on break.
How did you find me?
"Mm, girl's got to eat."
One of mine saw you here and told me.
Ahh.
"I'm not here for you, love."
Don't worry.
What do you want?
"A couple of my girls got picked up and started talking to the cops, saying my name, talking about my business."
I've never said anything.
"I know, Chris."
"That's why you're still here enjoying your new life, spending time with your sons."
The other girls aren't so lucky.
Anyway.
"Point is, if the cops do show up asking you questions,"
I hope you forget my name.
"Of course, Terry."
I'd never say anything.
Sure.
I know you wouldn't.
Ah.
All I know is how to sit down and order a meal.
Not for you.
Just a place to hang.
The chef is great.
The shows are good.
There's a lot of whores coming in.
What do you want from me?
Tommy's a bad seed.
What am I supposed to do?
Shoot him?
That wouldn't be a bad idea.
I'm sorry I said that.
I didn't mean it.
It's just that he's scaring me.
please.
Know anything about the restaurant business?
He knows everything.
He's there day and night.
he could be a stool.
You want me to be your partner?
Is that what you're telling me?
please.
It's not even fair.
You don't understand.
You run the joint.
Maybe I'll try to help you.
Paulie.
You've always been fair with me.
he goes to Paulie.
he goes to Paulie.
Tommy hecallsPaulie.
But now he has to pay Paulie everyweekno matterwhat.
That's no question to ask a young girl!
What's Pepita the Elephant?
An elephant.
Right.
You're both nuts.
How old is she now?
Are you afraid she's yours?
-Is she?
She has no father.
Would you like some coffee?
-Yeah.
Give me your hand.
I'll read your palm.
You have a weird pulse.
It's like two parallel rhythms.
A steady Finnish hump.
And a fiery beat.
You're like Iceland:
"ice on the surface, fire inside."
You should show this fire to a red-haired woman.
She's been waiting for you for quite a while.
"Damn you, Jesse!"
Wrong hole.
The balcony will be out there!
Move it!
I'll come back tonight.
-It's a deal.
I'm no little girl although I like firefighters.
Fight fire with fire.
Ouch...
I don't think you're up to this.
I must fire you.
- Good.
I'll excuse myself.
"I'm gonna go to the ladies room and I'm going to remove my new, improved butt."
I would like you to order me a petite fillet and a wedge salad.
- And then we'll get to work.
- Will do.
Apology accepted.
- You must be Nora.
- Yes.
- Lawrence McGill.
- Very nice to meet you.
"Oh, my God, look at those earrings."
"Let me guess, a carat and a half?"
"Uh, yeah."
"Uh, are you a jeweler?"
No.
I make it my business to notice beautiful things.
Yes.
Please forgive me.
I'm a little nervous about all this.
- You're a virgin.
- Hardly.
I have five children.
I mean a dating service virgin.
"Oh, yeah."
"Well, yes."
I am.
Are you?
"Oh, no."
I'm an old whore at this point.
Lots of first dates.
"Seconds, not so much."
Then the sword might not even work.
"And if it doesn't, the guy's going to come looking for it."
We are in a race.
We're in a race.
You two have to find what happened to that tsuba and fast.
"Well, Artie, we're looking for a 500-year-old sword."
800.
Exactly.
So it should be easy.
You guys follow the tsuba.
I will follow--
Ah...the implosion grenade.
And one of us will find the thief.
W--wait.
"I mean, wh--wh--where are you going?"
Somebody is making new grenades.
Somebody who promised not to.
Again he doesn't answer.
And no good-bye.
This is impossible.
Keep at it though. you're the smart one.
- What are you doing?
- What?
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
You're--you're doing great.
- Hello.
"- Leena, hey."
"Hey, is--is Claudia there?"
"Okay, she won't be able to find it either."
Claudia's out.
It's just me.
"Night, hon."
Sorry!
- Trauma.
"- No problem, I just have to hurry."
How come?
- Don't get upset.
- Why would I be upset?
I need to clean for...
Sandy?
There's a real estate agent coming by first thing in the morning.
I need more milk.
A...
A real estate...
"OK, I give."
Why?
I was going to tell you on the way home.
To value the townhouse.
Value?
I just want to see how much it's worth.
- I know what value means.
"- I'm not selling, it would just be good to know in case."
- You're going to be in Dallas...
- I told you I'd pay my share!
- It's too big for me and Maya.
- It's only a contract!
You don't know that!
And it might be nice to be close to Mom.
Mom?
"Yeah, in case I need help."
"Sandy, Mom dropped Maya on her head."
It was an accident.
"Mel, you can't just go and make changes like this..."
Whatever you said just now.
You continue the tale.
"Do it, sister."
Remember anything?
"Whatever it is bit, or scene let it be anything."
A villain entered the scene then.
Who is he?
- How will he be?
- He's...
- Come out.
- He stole my bike.
He's short...
What's his name?
Bald head...
Halwa...where are you going?
My back is punctured.
But you're not like Halwa.
Isn't it?
He's just like you.
Where's my bike?
Where's my bike?
Stop...stop...
Where's my bike?
To whom did you sell it?
"You come aside, I'll tell you."
How could you love such a man?
I don't know.
"I'm angry on him, I hate him...but..."
Whatever he said was fresh and new.
I liked his kick.
Did we love so much?
It's good.
"Brevity, the soul of wit."
But he was a writer.
Look at all these letters.
"No, there's something weird about this."
"Monk, look around you."
That note's probably the least weird thing in the whole apartment.
This is the birthplace of weird.
But why today?
This guy was a lottery nut.
Isn't tomorrow night the big jackpot?
Yeah.
"Yeah, he probably knew he'd never win, which makes him a whole lot smarter than me."
What do you got?
Contact lens case.
With only one lens.
Fluid!
It's fluid!
I need a wipe.
I don't have a wipe.
G-give me a wipe.
Just I need a wipe.
Where's Natalie?
I'm your biggest fan.
I never Miss a show.
Thank you.
That means a lot.
"Natalie, what's your favorite number?"
"My gosh, there's so many."
- Mine's 19.
- That's a good one.
Do you think it's gonna come up on the show tomorrow?
"I'm sorry, Mr. Monk."
Are you parents divorced?
My mom is dead
My mom and dad are getting a divorce.
What happened there...?
Just some kids.
At school.
Where do you go to school anyway?
"I never see you.... ...Owen, listen."
...What...?
You have to hit back.
You have to hit back hard.
I can't ...There are three
Then you hit back even harder.
Hit them harder than you dare And then they'll stop.
...What if they hit me back?
You have a knife.
Yeah...
But what if that didn't stop them?
I'll help you.
But..
You're a girl...
I'm a lot stronger than you think I am
...I have to get in there...!
...Move Move...
- Mr. Zoric...?
"- Yes, Owen?"
I was wondering.
About the after school strength training?
Can people still sign up?
...You like to get strong?
Okay.
Four o'clock.
What are we going to do with everyone ?
People are scared.
They'll get hungry.
And what about looters ?
We just have to get organized.
"Also, keep the radio on and gather up anything you think might be useful... flashlights, blankets, water, batteries, you'll be fine."
I can't get through to either of the boys.
"Well, keep trying."
How about you ?
We should get you to the hospital.
"I'm fine, it's just a bump on the head."
Mine.
Not his or hers.
Hello.
"Ryan, where are you ?"
They're at the Cooper house with Taylor.
Tell him to stay there.
Okay.
"Just stay there, okay."
All right.
Seth ?
"Hey, Dad."
"Yeah, yeah, we're okay."
I wish I could say the same for Ryan's car though.
How's Mom ?
Mm-hmm.
And Ryan ?
Ryan and Taylor are at your house.
"Yeah, sounds good, we'll do that."
"All right, take care."
Found a flashlight.
I can see that.
- Yeah.
"No, you don't."
'Cause I just made it up.
"Don't you want a warm, wet jimmy ha-ha?"
No.
You live there?
Cool.
I'm gonna live in an apartment.
"Next year, maybe."
"- Yeah, right."
- I am.
"My sister's gonna get a loft apartment, and she said I could live with her."
She won't even letyou sit in her car.
- Can we come in?
"- Yeah, can we come in?"
We'll be good.
"Go eat it outside, Robby."
Okay!
I just need to put on my jacket.
- Can we see your parents' room?
- My parents are separated.
My dad sleeps there.
"He'll be home, like, any second."
"We're each going to do it, and you have to tell us what the difference is."
"Like, how it feels different when she does it from when I do it."
Exactly.
"Thank you, Rebecca."
"You're welcome, Heather."
- But first we need a towel and-
- And a washcloth.
Right.
A wet washcloth and a dry washcloth.
Two more.
Do not waver.
You'll leave?
Yes.
I'll leave you alone.
Who said I'd let you leave?
Then let me ask you one thing.
What?
Why in God's name is he doing this?
Because her father has sinned.
What sin?
What sin did I commit?
Her father suspected another.
"He tried to kill him, and finally succeeded."
But my daughter...!
My daughter...
My daughter got sick first!
How can that...
How can that possibly...
"One more, now."
How can that be...?
Don't do it.
What are you saying?
Whether you walk out of here or not is completely up to you.
Touch me and see.
"A ghost does not have flesh and bones, and you see I have both."
Park Chun-bae
No.
That's not it.
It's you.
No.
This is all your doing.
"Excuse me, sweetheart."
So here you two are!
You're my friend.
You saved my life.
You get to wear my crown.
You are my friend
I'll be forever loyal
And you are my destiny
Franzie... dear Franzie.
"What is it, snookums?"
I can't make heads or tails of this stuff.
"Franz, how about we get away from this place?"
Why?
I've got money I can lend you.
Why?
Things are fine here.
You sent all the guys off.
Now we're short tonight.
We've got a first-class replacement.
Who?
I see.
Mr. Peep Peep.
A most respectable man... who'll soon be chirping a different tune.
Let's move out to the suburbs.
Come in.
"Miss Cilly, there's a man here to see you."
I just look at tax forms and I'm lost.
Reinhold says to tell you we need ―
You know.
He wants Franz to stop by.
Well?
Reinhold sent word to go see him.
Robbie.
Ease off.
You started this dance.
"He was stupid, you were stupid."
"Come on, let's just forget it and get out of here."
Come on.
"Thanks, Sonny."
"Forget it, man."
That's what I'm here for.
"Hey, I don't want to see you guys in here again."
"Yeah, we love you, too."
"Forget it, Annie."
You don't wanna be in the music business.
It's a jungle.
Exotic dancing ain't exactly the United Nations.
Neither is stripping.
I got a great set of pipes.
"Really, I do."
I agree.
But can you carry a tune?
"# Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz?"
#
# My friends all have Porsches #
# I must make amends ##
"I need a singer, not a stripper."
I'll have my agent call you.
Sometimes it helps them if you pat them on the fanny.
"Oh, yeah?"
Thanks.
You got a baby?
"Well, in a manner of speaking."
His name's Noogie and I'm married to him.
Ted Carter?
- No.
"- Don't you lie to me, don't lie!"
I'm not lying to you.
"Doc, help me."
I need your help.
"What do you mean by ""help""?"
I don't want to have the baby.
Give me something.
There's nothing I can give you.
Tell me who's responsible.
I can help you that way.
You can get married.
He's already married.
Then he'll have to take care of you and provide for the baby.
Who is it?
- Please just give me something!
- Selena!
"I've done a lot of things, but I've never broken a law."
What you're asking me to do is break the law of man and God.
"Now, tell me, who is the man?"
"Selena, tell me who he is."
Who is he?
It's my stepfather!
It's my stepfather!
It's Lucas!
"Hi, doc, come on in, have a drink."
I've got Selena in my office.
Selena?
What for?
She's pregnant.
I told her she'd get in trouble.
If I told them everything they'd never let me go out.
Baby... come on.
"Simon, we've got to talk."
"Simon, look at me!"
- You are always watching porn.
"- Just go, OK?"
It was only porn.
It didn't mean anything.
I did it for us.
You are dead to me.
- You look like a worn-out corn hole.
- Simon just dumped me.
- You were hooked on each other.
- It was the porn mag.
He's always jerking off to porn.
Men can be real creeps.
"Take this, baby."
- What is it?
- X.
- I can't swallow pills.
- You can't use that for diddly shit.
Now swallow.
"That wasn't so bad, was it?"
"Come on, they're playing our song."
Whoever finishes first wins the pile.
"- That's a lot of coke, Marc."
- A gram each.
That's nothing.
- On the count of three.
"- I'II wipe you out, faggot!"
- You're history.
"- Three, two, one, GO!"
"I'll take you to a movie, ok?"
"Oh, I love you."
"I love you, rags."
"We'll have a good day, huh?"
You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.
Mr. Dennings?
"Well, you know, it's ok."
"Well, thank you very much, but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?"
You like him.
"Yeah, I like him."
Don't you like him?
"Hey, what's going on?"
"What is this, huh?"
"You're going to marry him, aren't you?"
"Oh, God, are you kidding?"
Me marry Burke Dennings?
Don't be silly.
Of course not.
Where did you get that idea?
But you like him.
Of course.
"I like pizzas, too, but I'm not going to marry one."
You don't like him like daddy?
"Regan, I love your daddy."
"I'll always love your daddy, honey."
Burke just comes around here a lot because...
"Well, he's lonely."
Don't got nothin' to do.
"Well, I heard..."
Differently.
"Oh, you did?"
What did you hear?
-Then talk to him.
-I don't know.
"It's worth finding out, if you like her."
"I do, so much."
I can't stop thinking about her.
I can't sleep..
You know what?
You have to go for it.
How often does this happen to you?
You owe it to yourself.
Here's your warm milk.
I'm gonna put the bourbon in it at home.
"Anyway, seriously, just talk to the guy, okay?"
Let me know how it goes.
It's Rachel.
You're having a baby and you need to prepare.
You're gonna make yourself watch the whole thing.
Just do it!
I came to the big city to become a star.
-I'll do anything to make that happen.
-Anything?
Maybe it starts with how she gets pregnant.
I wonder which one of these guys becomes the father.
"No, no."
Can't get pregnant that way.
-Oh!
"Hey, Rach!"
-Hi.
-Happy Valentine's Day!
-You too!
How's living at Ross'?
TERRY:
Greg.
(CLEARS THROAT)
(CLEARS THROAT)
"What's up, chief?"
"What's up, chief?"
How long have we been mates?
How long have we been mates?
"Well, I don't know."
"Back in stir, '74?"
"Well, I don't know."
"Back in stir, '74?"
"What have I done, Greg?"
"What have I done, Greg?"
Why don't you love me anymore?
Why don't you love me anymore?
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
I know about Bangkok.
Setting up your own supply.
I know about Bangkok.
Setting up your own supply.
"Look, Terry..."
"Look, Terry..."
"Why would you do that - go behind my back, betray me?"
"Why would you do that - go behind my back, betray me?"
I just thought that...
I know what you thought.
I just thought that...
I know what you thought.
You thought you'd steal my customers.
You thought you'd steal my customers.
I know we're late.
"We're on our way,"
"I don't know what's going on, I can't get a cab."
"Okay, we're on our way, I'm sorry."
Bye.
"In my wallet there's a secret number for a taxi,"
I always get one through them.
Don't forget the text.
And take my binder from the desk.
"Too tight, too tight."
You're pulling it too hard.
Do it yourself.
Goni.
Gonki.
Help me.
"It's my fault, I'm sorry."
Is everyone here?
Of course.
Shall we go in?
"- Yes, we're anxious to continue, sir."
Want to get together after rehearsal?
I don't think so.
How about this weekend?
"I can't, I'm working."
I'm busy with my father.
I'm sorry if I offended you yesterday.
Forget it.
Walk gracefully.
It's Europe.
"Not here, not Tel Aviv."
"Not coarse, not hot."
Graceful.
What's that behind you?
Turn round...
"To the left, the one you touched."
Careful you don't break it.
Try to free it.
Pull it out.
Toss it up to me.
He was tall!
It's your size.
is it the left leg or the right?
It's a leg bone. lt's not a shoe.
"Are you well, Mrs Godarzi?"
"Thank you, you're very kind... lt's very difficult reaching you."
"It was the same in Tehran, always engaged."
Yes...
We're ready.
"Yes, they're ready too..."
Everyone's ready.
"Yes, if you don't mind, when you call, you have to wait a few minutes until I drive up to higher ground."
"Yes, that very place."
"Yes, yes."
All right.
Don't mention it...
Thank you...
Good-bye.
Behzad...
Hello.
Are you well?
- Why are you here?
- l've come to see you.
How did you know I was here?
"When I brought the bread, I asked Mim Kharaman,"
- Of course you will.
- Adam's a pro...
- Of course.
All adults.
"- And, uh, we're all adults here."
Let's play some video games.
I hate this stupid game.
Shoot!
The game hates you.
Next victim?
Who's up for it?
"I am, if that's cool."
"Yeah, it's, uh, it's cool."
"- Oh, just gonna--"
- I'm gonna go with you.
- I'm gonna get the potato salad.
- Would you go...
"Oh, I'll go with you."
I'll go someplace else.
I didn't know you could drift in this game.
It takes practice.
"You brake, accelerate, and then you move the wheel like this."
Watch it.
Sorry.
I didn't mean...
Bri--Brian.
"Adam, come on."
We cool?
"Everybody's cool now, right?"
Good morning.
"Yeah, but we definitely want something back before 10:00, okay, so would you..."
"Hey, everybody, look who's back, huh?"
Uneventful.
I heard that Hybra Tech is sponsoring one of the monster trucks for the big rally next week.
Really?
I didn't know that.
I was wondering if you can score some tickets for me and Zeke?
Or not.
Becky!
Hi Julian!
Look out!
"Beck, are you alright?"
"Grap my bag, I'll get your bike."
How many bikes is it this month?
"I don't know, four?"
Hi Becky.
How are you doing?
"Oh, I am doing fine."
How are you?
Hi Guys!
Hi Katie.
Hi Baby.
What's wrong?
No kiss for the former-boyfriend?
You smell like farm wather.
"I got it, calm down."
I take it as he's not handling the break-up to well?
No.
Hi Guys!
Are you going to check out my gymnastics today?
"Oh yeah, bet you look real good bent over the bar."
Up your!
"Name the time, You got 4 more years to get a piece of this solid man."
What did he mean?
I was taking that kid!
I should have gone tonight!
I should have been with you!
"It's all right, Julie!"
It's all right!
Julie!

I can't fight no more!
I can't fight no more!
"I know, Bill!"
But you won't have to!
I can't fight no more!
"You won't have to fight no more, Bill!"
"I'll make it up to you, darling!"
We'll get that cigar stand you were telling me about!
!
or maybe even a piece of that fighter!
"It's going to be all right, Bill!"
You wait and see!
Julie!
I won tonight!
- I won!
"- Yes, you won tonight, Bill!"
We both won tonight!
We both won tonight!

"Yes, this is my town."
It's not new to you.
"You've read books about it, you've seen movies."
People are always talking about New York.
"It's the most exciting city in the world, they say, the most glamorous, the most frightening, and above all, the fastest."
"I guess that would've been structural letdown, huh?"
You know this place?
Yeah. it's a fleabag hotel.
"They say that Bret Easton Ellis, he got drunk... and he threw up in a flag tree."
The thing won't stop growing.
They got to keep trimming it.
- Just relax.
- He's a very good writer.
Just relax.
Thanks.
- I'll wait here for you.
- Thank you for your help.
Walt.
We're not done yet.
We gotta find Alex.
My whole first chapter hangs on that.
Go home and use your imagination for chapter one.
Hi.
Last time I was here I stayed in room 323.
Kind of a good luck thing.
It's available?
Nope.
But I got 305 across the hall.
That's fine.
Sign.
"Good evening, Mr. Dzasokhov."
"You're a very pretty girl, Alex."
You know that?
Thank you.
Will you do me a favor?
The band is too loud.
It's a birthday party.
- So let's try the other.
- That's where it has to be.
- Are you getting tired?
- No.
- All right.
[Rachel] I'm gonna start to scream soon.
I'm gonna go out and throw myself under a car.
That's the only thing I can do.
He was waiting for the doctor's call when I left.
What kind of a mother am I?
What kind of a mother am I?
I don't know where he is.
He might even be in a hospital.
I don't know.
I'm gonna start to scream at the top of my voice.
I don't care if they put me in jail.
I have to find my Freddy!
I want my Freddy!
Fred Baker.
My only child.
I'm gonna break everything.
I
- If I can't find him...
I will break everything here.
Everything.
"Fred Baker, where are you?"
Where are you?
Where are you?
"Fred Baker, where are you?"
Where are you?
[Ida] It was hanging up from the ceiling.
"He must be one of those there, on the wall."
"Fido, come here!"
You guys are crazy!
What do you think you're doing?
- The swine!
- Are you all right?
You picked the wrong guy!
Here's your hat.
Did they hurt you?
They picked the wrong guy.
"What's going on, Officer?"
What's happening?
So you don't know either?
He's playing dumb.
What do you want?
Franz is ―
He's in there dancing with some fat cow.
Violets.
"Here, Cilly."
I shouldn't really accept these.
How much longer will it be?
You two gonna become trash pickers?
Break every bone in his body ― he won't change.
But you're a clever girl.
"Listen, I'll get you ten other guys."
"I need him, and he'll do as I say!"
Forget about Franz!
"You love him, huh?"
Won't help me out?
- No.
- Say that again!
Let me go!
You don't like me anymore anyway.
Unless Venice has been overrun by the French.
No flag.
No signal.
Why not?
She must see our colours.
She must've heard us clear for action.
"Mr. Ponsonby, private night signal."
Hoist the night signal.
- No reply.
"- The gun ports are open, sir."
We can't wait for her broadside.
"I'm just as suspicious as you, but we must be sure."
We can't expose the ship like this.
We must fire now!
- All right.
Run out your guns.
"- Aye, aye, sir."
But hold your fire!
Run out your guns!
Heave!
What ship are you?
We are His Majesty's ship Defiant.
What ship are you?
Fire party to number five gun!
Mr. Ponsonby!
It's his arm.
Get him below.
"Hudson, King!"
Get the captain below!
The captain's been hit!
Take your orders from me!
Ready!
It's OK.
I was too drunk to worry about it.
But really.
What were the odds I'd be scooped up by that other removal guy?
I couldn't take a step without being reminded of Johan.
"- So, what's up?"
"- Yeah, what's up?"
"Well, let me think."
Just screw the brain out of me.
"So, you really moved my stuff?"
(cell phone rings)
"Yeah, two hours or something."
I just need to move this piano.
"See you, honey."
Yeah?
Yes...
"Yeah, OK."
- What are you doing?
"- Hey, OK..."
- You're sick.
Sick!
"- Hey, sorry, OK?"
(slow jazz)
"I know this is awkward, but I'm just back from Paris and I..."
I just thought...
Can I come in?
"No, this is a bad idea."
I really feel bad.
"You were so good to me, and I just didn't..."
"I know I've completely screwed up, but if you'll forgive me..."
"Anna, please don't!"
I don't blame you for not daring.
No.
But I bet you do.
Mm-hmm.
"I bet you have a big, thick pair of bifocals."
"She doesn't have daddy issues, she has granddaddy issues."
I'm ending it.
"Ted, I beg of you, don't quit on a body that won't quit."
"Ooh, ooh, that'll go sweet on a bumper sticker."
That's going in the journal.
"Wait, did you steal my dream journal?"
No!
"Now, get back in there before all your teeth fall out and you're naked in front of Shaker Heights High School in a play you never rehearsed for."
Bastard!
We don't connect on a single thing.
It's over.
It's not...
"Look, Carly, I got to tell you something."
"I just, I don't see a future here."
"Oh, my God."
Are you dying?
"Oh, that is so hot."
Hey... is that R2-D2?
Do you like Star Wars?
I love Star Wars.
"Me, too!"

"I mean, I've only seen the new ones."
Close enough.
So?
Yeah.
I knew it!
I could feel it.
Addons Have you seen this video 2 months ago.

Addons I was nice to see a man killed right before your eyes?
Of course not!
"Addons But you watch again, right?"
And again .. and again.
I just want to know.
I think it's fake.
No one who saw something like that.
Everything we do.
Who are we doing it?
This is fun ... friends.
We will not play.
"Addons If you are in doubt, Prizes will be lost."
"Oh, jeez, we gotta find out who she is."
"If this guy's feeling cornered, all bets are off."
Tonight's his last chance to get revenge on anyone who's ever wronged him.
She's most likely his next target.
[Dialing]
"Garcia, we're gonna send you some photographs."
- What do you want me to do with them?
- Blow up the background.
See if you can find anything that tells us who this girl is.
I'll hit you back.
[Man] Uh-uh.
We're closed.
"No, you're not."
Not to me.
"Boy, what's wrong with you?"
Get out.
Not tonight.
Where is she?
Where's Tracy?
"Kaman, I said... get out."
Can't.
I can't do that tonight.
They coming after me.
What have you done?
I just need to see her.
"I told you, don't come back in here."
It's over.
"Son, you need to get some help."
"Don't you do it, old man!"
Aah!
- [Blows landing] - [Crying out]
[Groaning]
You want a ripe mango?
Come on!
I'm in the mall!
Yes sis.
"Okay, bye!"
How's Joy?
.
Why are you looking for her?
What do you want to hear?
.
That she's okay?
.
And she's not looking for you?
You two have incredibly think faces.
Don't you ever mess with my sister again.
I saw Migs yesterday.
He even asked how you're doing.
What did you say?
.
Of course I nagged him!
Oh my!
He was even with that Bela!
After what he did to you?
.
I can't believe his guts!
"Sis, what I did was right, wasn't it?"
"Sis, is it really like that when you're pregnant?"
You're not just craving for the food.
You're also craving for the place where you want to eat!
My gosh.
"And you know, this place is too far!"
Even taxis can't get here anymore.
Okay.
Okay.
Stop laughing!
Bella?
"Okay,okay,okay."
Holy cow.
Okay.
"God,be careful!"
What was the plan here?
"You know,to show Augie that he's an idiot."
"I figured he'd see some hair,come on to me, and then,you know..."
I take advice from you?
Hey.
Good morning.
Did I wake you?
No.
"No,I..."
I thought you were gone.
I was gonna make you some breakfast.
Come back to bed.
Come here.
Are you okay?
I'm in bed with the girl of my dreams.
Why wouldn't I be okay?
I'm so glad we talked yesterday.
"I was really overwhelmed and ready to bolt, and you were just so cool and understanding."
I don't want to make the same mistakes I made last time.
You know...
"I think that I am going to have to write,like, a couple million songs about you."
"Oh,yeah?"
Is that okay?
"Or do you need me to,like,taper back?"
He's accused of raping Alicia.
What are you talking about?
Try to help him.
The poor guy's got nobody.
Have you been to see him?
Me?
"After what he's done, I can't."
But he needs help and you're his friend.
All right.
What jail is he in?
It's in Segovia.
"Wait here for me, please."
Hello.
Hello.
I'd like to see an inmate.
"That's in Visitations, through that door to the left."
Thank you.
May I help you?
I'd like to see the inmate Benigno Martin.
"This isn't a visitor's day, but let me see."
"I'm sorry, I can't hear you."
I'm sorry.
This isn't a visitor's day.
"and what's more, the intern hasn't requested a visit."
He doesn't know I'm in Madrid.
I arrived yesterday.
Are you a relative?
"No, I'm a friend."
My name is Marco Zuloaga.
"May I see your ID, please?"
"Yes, of course."
Can I phone him?
"- Okay, well, you don't know."
Obviously you're not fans.
You're heating on me 'cause I'm supposedly not a fan.
"Not happening, chicken banger."
"Okay, I'm just going for the book, so."
"Yeah, around here, after 7:30, it's Alice in Chains or nothin'."
"Oh, now, now."
"What's your name, bud?"
"Hey, I'm Blake."
"I'm a hard rocker too, so I get it."
"And I'm married, butt pirate."
Hey.
"Hang on, buddy."
"We're all friends, here."
No need for the name calling.
"- Fuck off, Eddie Bauer!"
- You know what?
- Whoa.
- I've got this.
You can't talk to my friends that way.
- Is that a fact?
- Yeah.
I bet I can pour this beer on your head...
Like that.
Oh!
"Hey, come on, that's a..."
That's a perfectly good Molson.
"Hey, shit-head!"
"Try that again, and this is gonna happen to your dick."
"Yeah, that's right."
That's your ding-dong in two pieces!
"Oh, I want you to hit me so bad right now!"
"Hi, Christo."
Manou's resting in her room.
I'll tell her you're here.
Let her rest.
She OK?
Just OK.
Still after that van gang?
Still am.
I hear they hit again.
"Near the beltway, right?"
My only advice is:
"when you bust 'em, shoot first!"
You know anything?
I'm not a snitch.
Ask your questions elsewhere.
Who worked over Manou?
What do you mean?
Leo...
"I'm 46, I spent 1 8 years in jail."
She's the best thing that happened to me.
"Someone hurt her, I gotta know."
"If I tell you, what'll you do?"
That's up to me.
You're in trouble any time you step out of here!
"You're a hood, Christo."
With a record for armed robbery.
"If you smack your neighbor over a trifle, you go back to jail!"
Manou needs you:
"if you go down, so does she."
Screw your cop morality.
"Anyway, it's settled."
I dealt with it.
"Ooh, let's make some spicy ones."
Amy doesn't like spicy.
"Actually, she prefers no meat."
You work at a butcher shop.
Yeah.
"Okay, what about we make some hot sauce to dip them in?"
Good idea.
Remember that time...
No.
Not unless you tell me the time.
You got the fusilli stuck up your nose?
"Okay, whose idea was that?"
And Mrs. Ramsey called the fire department to get it out.
I was turning blue in the face.
I stuck it up both...
"Oh, hi."
"Oh, hi, Amy."
I didn't hear you come in.
"Hi, I take it you're Clementine?"
Yeah.
Nice to meet you.
And who's this?
That's the guy I wanted you to meet.
"That's our son, John."
"Hey, John, say hi to daddy's friend Clementine."
No.
(SIGHS)
It's a great apartment.
"Thanks, yeah, we're good."
"So, how long have you been married?"
"Um, just a couple of weeks now."
"Oh, whoa, so you just got married."
- You're not pleased to see your friend?
- We're not that close.
- He's been causing me a lot oftrouble.
- I'm here to sort it out.
Please sit.
I'll put on some tea.
- Don't bother.
- No need.
- Please be careful.
"- Take care,Jenny."
I know how to do it.
I won't hurt myself.
"Jeffrey, take care ofyour friend, meanwhile."
"Make yourselfat home, Dumbo."
"I am, Mickey Mouse."
"Ma'am, why are you so concerned about the garbage?"
He paid me a thousand bucks to keep you talking.
Don't leave now!
I haven't had this much fun in 20 years!
- You're going to lose this game.
- Am I?
Lets wait and see.
You're always the loser.
Not this time.
I'm well prepared.
Let's put your preparations to the test.
- Are you always so determined?
"- Yes, that's my style."
Mine too.
So we have something in common.
Is that what you think?
Definitely.
You've got it.
Oh.
Goddamn right I have it!
Here!
"We're leaving, and we will never drink your overpriced ""Runaway Root Beers"" again."
But here's a nice tip because you gave us very good service.
Where did that money come from?
- Just be glad I had it.
- Thank you.
It's okay.
We're a team.
What the hell are we gonna do?
I know one thing.
We're gonna put on a brave face.
It's best that the kids don't know how bad things are right now.
We... are... fucked.
"Ooh, it's colder in here than it is outside."
"Okay, Kevin, I'm coming in now!"
I'm not doing anything!
One new message.
"Frank, it's Bob Pogo."
We used to work together at Mohican...
Airways.
It's an airline... down at the airport.
"Aw, shit, you know who I am!"
Here's the thing...
- Is somebody there?
"- Jesus, Dolores, hang up the extension!"
You don't have to bite my head off.
"I'm sorry, dear."
Don't cry.
"- So, Frank..."
Wash your hands first.
Where did that hair come from?
- Where?
- There?
That black thing.
Oh!
There's another one.
"Oh, wait."
It's the full moon!
I must be turning into the beast!
"Yeah, that moustache could do with a trim, too."
- I can see some...
- Ssh!
- Rhydian?
"- 'Listen, mate.'"
I've got a bit of a vomiting situation with my substitute parents.
They're throwing up everywhere.
Oh!
"Yeah, and I'm on bucket duty so I'm not going to be able to make it out."
"OK, well..."
"Oh, there she blows."
"Right, I've got to go."
No Rhydian?
What is it with everyone today?
Must be the full moon.
"You know, we don't have to do this."
- What?
- Stay here.
I don't care how your parents try and justify this.
It's still a cage.
It's still unnatural.
We agreed.
That means... we pretend that we've done nothing for two weeks.
"Put him on, I want to talk to him... I want to talk to him..."
At least give him my message.
I simply can't do that.
No.
Why do they want the material?
"No, answer me."
Why do they want the material?
We don't want to use it as a pillow.
"Yes... ln any case, that's impossible."
Yes... lt sounds as if we're guilty!
I'll contact him myself.
I'll call...
Good-bye.
"Hello, are you well?"
"- Yes, thank you."
- What do you want?
Can I have a word with Farzad?
Sohrabi?
Yes.
He's sitting an exam.
I know. lt won't take a minute.
Please call him for me.
Sohrabi!
You're wanted.
Are you well?
Yes.
Are you sitting an exam?
Yes.
is there a question that you can't answer?
"No, I know them all."
I want to apologise about this morning.
When he was high.
That went on for about 3 or 4 years.
Until one day he strangled me.
And I'd had enough.
I told him he should let me go.
I'd come right back.
"I put my daughter to bed, left her room and stabbed him with a knife."
Six.
Seven.
Ow!
Twelve.
- Come now.
"- Thank you, Master Walter."
Good girl.
It's not even warm yet.
And then I met Marcel.
He was the first man.
I got into SM with.
"He showed me all kinds of things, candle wax and everything."
Until alcohol also came into play.
When he was drunk he had no taboos.
"He tortured me to the extreme with needles, whips, you name it."
Until I ran away covered in blood.
I was in hospital.
laid charges against him.
He got 4 years.
Which he had to serve.
And that was that.
One.
- Two.
- A children's toy.
"From Toys ""R"" Us."
And for dinner.
Your secret room rocked my world.
"Yeah, it did."
But I am gonna give you a deadline.
A deadline?
For our date...
A real date.
It's got to happen tonight.
You get dressed up.
So do I.
"I pick you up... not here, but at your apartment."
"Where is that, by the way?"
"- Oh, it's not far... at all."
"- Okay, good."
And we'll go to my favorite restaurant.
"And afterwards, I show you my place."
Mm.
I-I need a little bit more advance notice.
"How... how about the last Saturday of this month,"
- 'cause tonight I have this...
- Cancel it.
"Look, if you don't do this for me, I..."
I don't know.
"Because your life is here, but... mine is not."
I got it.
You're right.
- I'll meet you by the elevators.
- Mm-hmm.
6:00 P.M.?
And if you aren't there...
I won't be back again.
Mother.
"Ah, shit."
"Yeah, that's ah, that's palladium."
"Riley, you're a fucking idiot."
"Man, just say what?"
Don't talk to my crew like that.
At least he's doin' something.
Have you tried playing dead?
I gotta show you somethin'.
"Blair, I don't get it."
"I mean, there's nothing in this house."
Why would anyone keep it on lock down?
It gets worse.
Great.
"What, we gonna pay Timmy Song back with with a 200 dollar TV?"
So he's into low-budget slasher flicks.
"Really, really big special effects budgets."
Same place.
Same place.
"Ollie, I'm really scared."
Blair.
Let's get out of here.
"I was gonna say I'm really scared too, but yeah, let's get the fuck outta here."
How can Conner's inside not know this?
Hey.
"He had an inside, right?"
That's what it said in the plans.
"No, he lied on the plans."
There's no inside.
Shit.
Connor!
Shit.
It's all your fuckin' fault.
Yup.
- Can I tell you something?
- What?
Don't take this the wrong way
I never got it.
I never thought she was right for you.
"You're too... wild, too alive."
I was wondering if maybe you needed a place to stay tonight.
Griff!
"Natasha's not here, but don't panic."
I got an address from the manager for 20 bucks.
"Hugh, we were thinking about maybe calling it a night..."
No!
No way.
We're on a quest.
He's on a quest!
With a vision.
I did not know that.
- You have a vision?
"- Yes, he does."
It involves a fertility clinic and a stripper.
It's beautiful.
"Sounds gross, actually."
- You can come too.
"- No, you can't."
You're not in the vision.
She's not in the vision.
Marla.
It was good seeing you.
"You too, Griff."
Good luck.
"You OK, baby?"
- That's beside the point.
"""Ghastly little man,"" you call him."
Right.
I might as well go to bed.
You coming?
"Not for a minute, no."
"[Man singing on radio, indistinct]"
[Humming]
[Dorcas]:
"So you want pilchards, do you?"
[Janet]:
I think so.
We always used to use coley fish.
I'm sure.
I think pilchards would be better.
"You gonna make it, are you?"
All right.
What did he think of my pasties?
He loved them.
Ha!
Thought he might.
Don't forget the washing.
Looks like rain.
You know...
"When Andrea's able to walk, he's going to need some clothes."
"Yes, I know."
- I thought I'd use some of the money Aunt Elizabeth left me to get him a new outfit.
Why?
"What do you mean, ""why""?"
Why not use our joint account?
What?
We're both responsible for him.
"Yeah, maybe ten?"
Ten?
"Yeah, me too."
"But, did you get any flowers?"
I think you know I did.
"I thought it was really sweet, and I was gonna say, if you're not busy, we could hang out this Friday?"
I think I'm free.
"Yep, yes I am."
I'm working on the bar at a local Valentine's disco thing.
"It's under-18s, so it might be a bit lame, but if you fancied keeping me company?"
A date?
"No, Will, not a date."
Just two friends hanging out.
Great.
See you Friday.
It's a date.
"No, it's not a date."
Cool.
"She said it wasn't a date, but we both knew it was."
"Before that,"
"I had to make the most of my new, pointless, shitty manual job."
Hellooooo?
"Will MacKenzie, I'm here for work experience."
"Hello, you must be Will."
"Great to meet you, I'm Jim."
This here's Wolfie and Steve.
"Hi, Jim, hi, Steve, hello, Wolf."
Wolf-ie.
"Wolfie, right, gotcha."
You'll have a right laugh.
Long as you don't mind a bit of blue talk.
"- Not a poof, are ya?"
"You're busy selling your gear, so you don't need mine."
"You've got it all wrong, mate."
"- Shh, it's fine, fine."
"Let's call the boss, see what he thinks, shall we?"
"For-for fuck's sake, Jonesy."
"Just, this shit doesn't grow on trees."
You know what it's like.
I'm on hold on your tip-off...
"Just go away, just go!"
I was just explaining about the private party.
This isn't...
Not a problem...
Get a cab
Be careful.
Why don't you join us?
I wouldn't wanna intrude.
"Maybe, uh, maybe another time."
- Guide me.
- Swivel round and rock back.
"Yeah, that's it."
Okay.
"Come inside, I insist."
"Quick, come on."
"You can do it, come on."
Just go for it!
Gem!
Fuck!
Let's see how you like it.
No!
"Gem, listen to me."
Focus.
There's a saw.
"No, no, no, no, no, no."
This is about Kitty's social life.
I don't really want to intrude.
"Oh, trust me."
She loves to intrude.
She lives to intrude.
Nonsense.
You know what?
I love mother-daughter teams.
- It's twice as much fun.
- OK.
"Well, she loves contractors."
- Kitty.
"- Nora, I feel so confident in this,"
I'm not gonna charge you for this consultation.
Sit down.
Sit!
Great.
"OK, here's what we're gonna do."
Hey.
So this is really good.
"I would just change ""watchdog"" to ""necessary vigilance."""
Protection over fear?
It's good.
I like it.
Sit down.
I'll go over the whole thing.
"You know, actually, I..."
I kind of have to go.
Is it OK if we run through it tomorrow?
It's a personal matter.
- Oh.
- Did he tell you he went to see Marosi ?
- No.
"He's bottling it up, he's dealing with all of this on his own."
I bet he didn't tell you his girlfriend dumped him.
Hold on one second.
"Alright you lot, leave him alone."
"What's going on, Stevie ?"
Talk to me.
I don't want to take it.
I think you should kick that ball as hard as you can.
Go for it.
"Listen to me, Pru."
"He's going through a lot right now, so... promise me you'll be there if he needs you."
I promise.
"Ok, great."
Bye.
I think I have one for you.
Please...
Please...
It's all right.
I'm here to help you.
"Mark, it's me."
Listen...
I need Pru's number.
She should be in a hospital.
"No, sorry,no can do."
Hospitals require all kind of information.
"- No, you're doing great."
- She needs an internal scan.
Did she have anything on her ?
A phone or ID ?
She is yet to speak.
J.E.
Pepper!
Pepper!
Here we are!
Come on!
"Come on, digger!"
"Come on, there you go!"
"There you go, digger!"
Go get it!
Go get it!
Fetch!
"Fetch, digger!"
"Go, digger!"
"I didn't know you walked out this way, Andrew."
Yes.
One of digger's favorite spots when I'm in the area.
"Fit, are you?"
"- Yes, can't complain."
"My word, look at him go."
He's like a whippet.
"- Yes, isn't he?"
Sheer joy of living I call it.
Still digging up neighbor's gardens?
"Yes, digger by name, digger by nature."
"There's no cure in the book for that, I'm afraid."
"Actually, James,"
I'm glad we ran into each other.
I've been wanting to see you about digger.
"There's nothing wrong with him, is there?"
"Not really, but he is having some problems with his eyes."
How do you mean?
"- Alright, but hurry."
- Okay.
Tasty.
"You know, I'm honest only as much as I want to be."
How come?
"Well, just that I'm not so different from your character."
Really?
- Are you all by yourself?
"- Yes, she left."
"Anyway, both ladies are pretty tall, including the one before."
Aren't they?
How about the face?
Don't they look alike?
"Well, I can't say."
I couldn't see their faces closely.
- Is that so?
Alright.
- Good-bye.
But don't they look alike?
"Uh, sure."
That's possible.
- Good night.
"- Yes, good night."
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for you.
Would you like to have some?
What's this?
Were you drinking all by yourself?
"I'm the type you like, aren't I?"
"Yes, you're right."
I'm not having sex with you.
I am not having sex with you.
It's a case you worked on when you were a copper.
"Jesse, Alan's boy."
"He's back, Dad."
Jesse's come back.
Leave her!
Dad?
Look at him.
"- Take his face away from me, please."
"- Dad, he didn't do it."
He admitted to it.
And you believe that?
Dad I know he wrote you letters.
"- I destroyed them, they gave me the creeps."
- All of them?
- Yes.
What about mom?
Did she keep any of them?
You know what?
You're gonna have to ask her that.
"What is all this, Mark?"
It was 20 years ago.
Why are you bringing all this up again?
"Here we are, one chicken curry and one lamb tagine, sir."
Enjoy it.
- Disgusted or not you must have read them.
"- Yes, of course I read them."
- And?
Well you know he wanted us to meet him.
Wanted us to a... to talk.
- But of course we wouldn't entertain the idea.
- Why not?
'Coz he killed your brother.
Sure.
Come out!
Come out in the end.
We got them all.
Is there one left?
We can meet together now.
Where are you?
Why don't you come out?
What do you want?
"My name is Jurgen Hoffman, I'm a scientist."
I've come to get you out of here.
We should leave immediately.
What do you know?
I've watched through this window.
I've witnessed the deaths from over there.
I know how and why they died.
"You're in great danger, come with me."
So you tell me why they died.
What difference does it make to you?
Now.
Come with me.
Wait a minute you come to my place and you want me to leave and you don't want to tell me why?
"Ok, you have a creature, an alien creature on your roof."
Where?
I study these creatures.
"You're in great danger, come with me."
-Tell me where he is.
-You want to die?
-No.
-Let me explain.
-Let me go.
-Let me explain.
"And it's left-hand drive, so you're a cheapskate."
It's true!
It's never overtaken anyone.
That's what passengers are for.
His dog ate it.
She did.
A couple more I have to stick up -
"Mitsubishi Evo VIII, we looked at."
Where's it go?
AUDIENCE:
Sub-cool?
Wrong!
Why is it sub-cool?
It's a proper car.
It's fast and it handles well.
That's nothing to do with coolness.
It's like having ginger hair.
Anyone else got any thoughts on it?
MAN:
Uncool.
Uncool.
"He says it's uncool, he's kind of right."
"The thing is, it's very gender-specific."
"If you're a man, it's really uncool."
"If you're a woman, it's fantastic."
We wanna meet you.
"So it kind of goes there, as does...the same story with the Subaru."
Yeah.
Put that there.
Right in the middle with the F60.
"It's funny, it's the way of the cool wall."
"I've got one last one here, the Peugeot 206 GTI 180bhp."
- Better than tits you'll ever get mate!
"All right, I'd spunk over the big ones, and they're not better than I'd get."
Bollocks.
"Here, Steve..."
- Speccy here... reckons he has better!
- Stop that.
- I have.
"- Fuck off, you're a virgin!"
- Classic virgin.
- You're wrong.
I did it last year.
With a girl I'm seeing tonight.
"Yeah, sure."
Yep!
"She's fit, she's older than me, and she goes like a porn star."
"- Oh, right!"
"- Yeah, and she's got massive titties and I..."
"Well, I... fucked her hard and all night long."
What are you and this dirty horn bucket up to this weekend then?
I might come and check her out.
"Going to an under-18 disco where she works, so you won't be able to."
I could go.
- What?
- I could go.
I'm 17.
You're 17!
?
- You're 17?
"- Yeah, yeah"
- I just look older.
There's looking older and then there's that.
You look about 30!
Go hide and keep quiet!
"Stop Mieze, stop!"
Promise that you won't look behind that curtain!
I promise...
I promise.
I promise that I won't look behind that curtain.
- Yes.
There you go.
"I guess you brought something along, right?"
Stop giving me presents!
What's wrong with that?
Why not?
We have everything we need.
"I have a dress, you have your clothes."
What would we need more things for?
Because it's nice.
- What?
"- Franz, I wanna tell you something."
Go ahead!
I want to wear my old dress!
Blimey!
"We'll look for work, even if it's on a yard."
Why?
Why?
Where did you get that fur from?
I met an old friend.
"- He told you things about me, huh?"
- No.
- But you let him give you a fur!
- Yes!
And I can't?
I can't give you anything?
"Hey, man."
"It's all good, right?"
"Look, you get a little money in your pocket."
Nothing wrong with that.
"Just for now, right?"
Plus it's always good to have a roommate that can pay his half of the rent.
"Hey, what do you say you and me head down to the rec center?"
Got a pick-up rugby game going on.
"Then afterwards, maybe go get me some ribs, some corn."
Some hot chicks.
Maybe she got a friend for you.
But one of them ugly ones.
"Buck-toothed and, you know, just got the fangs."
"Got the fangs happening, huh?"
Know what?
Yeah.
Huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Just give me a couple minutes to change and then we'll head on out.
"Oh, dinner's on you tonight."
You still owe me...
"I think, what is it, $19.40?"
"Oh, you're serious about that?"
So...
Yeah.
Dinner and girls.
Both on you tonight.
"No, the girls will be on me."
I...
- If she hurt you...
"- No, no."
She... she didn't lay a hand on me.
"I'm fine, really, I'm just..."
I'm just tired.
Whose body am I in?
You've seen Liana.
"That's what happened to your face, isn't it?"
"Dad, tell me the truth."
"Where did this, me, come from?"
I need to know.
Musa sent you to us from a breeding camp.
"Your mother found you a human skin, even though I knew what it meant... an innocent."
Did it have a name?
The baby?
Allison.
"From the day you became Allison,"
I vowed to protect you with my life.
But...
I failed you.
No.
Yes.
We should have left.
Gone on the run.
"I'm so, so sorry."
"Dad, don't."
You did everything you could to protect me.
I always will.
I don't know what you're saying.
I'm saying that I love you.
"As long as I'm alive, you're in danger."
- They'll use us against each other.
Tell him I'll pick him up at 7.
Tell Nathan to come see me.
I'll do what I can.
Peyton?
Peyton!
- Where's Peyton?
- Dressing for school is my guess.
Who are you?
I'm the guy who's about to take that rake from you and beat your scrawny ass.
I'm her dad.
Who are you?
Oh.
Sorry.
The front door was open and I thought...
I'm Lucas.
Larry Sawyer.
"Hey dad, do you know where my..."
What are you doing here?
Oh he's trying to rake me to death.
What?
!
I thought you were... nothing crucial.
I'm gonna go put this back.
"- So, who's the guy?"
- What guy?
The one that's got you smiling.
That'd be my dad.
"Oh, I'd be smiling too but for entirely different reasons."
"Dude, that's my dad!"
Don't go all horndog on me.
There's a line!
"Speaking of which, I really don't wanna cross any so tell me if this is totally inappropriate to ask."
"No matter how much I mess up, they'll be there to help me."
But if he can't control his power -- it's all right.
How is it all right?
"By now, Steven has realized his powers are tied to his emotions."
Just like I knew would happen.
"He's used the memories of happy and sad things to land safely behind us, ready to give us a hug."
[ Grunts ]
Close enough.
Guys!
Wait!
You have somewhere else to be!
What?
There's no time!
Run to the big donut!
Run!
"Uh, okay!"
I would've liked a hug.
[ Panting ]
[ Gasps ] No way!
"No way, no way, no way, no way!"
Ooh!
Oh. [ Chuckles ]
Uh...
You're just opening?
I thought I was late!
Late?
We always open at 7:30 on Sundays.
"Ahh, duh!"
"Well, you're just in time."
Here you go!
My treat!
A fresh-baked frosted donut with sprinkles!
It's me.
Where are you?
What about you?
Don't ask me anything.
You need to get to your daughter.
Now.
Tell me what's going on?
I'm at your place.
"Get back to your house, now."
First tell me what's going on.
I...
I misread the divination.
It's not him.
What are you talking about?
I cast the hex on the wrong ghost.
I saw a woman in front of your house.
I made a grave mistake.
"A terrible, terrible mistake."
It's not the Japanese man.
That woman is the evil spirit.
It was all her doing.
"So, go home now."
"I'm on my way there, too."
Then...
Who's the Japanese man?
He was trying to kill that woman in order to save people from her.
Understand?
"That Japanese man- he's a shaman, like me."
Was the woman... wearing white?
Did you see her?
A young woman?
That's her.
"Come on, buddy."
What'd we talk about this year?
- Balance and torque.
"- That's right, come on."
Let's go!
See what you got.
"Hey, your head's moving all over the place, like this."
You're all over.
"Connor, pivot the back foot."
Pivot like this.
Pivot.
That's better.
"Hey, way to go."
Nice hit.
Good job.
"Look, that front foot's gotta land in the same place every time."
- It slipped.
- No excuses!
Come on!
"Hey, what's the matter with you?"
Your focus is all over the place today.
Need a refill?
A soda?
"- Uh, it's a vanilla shake."
"- Oh, yeah."
We don't do refills on shakes.
- Yeah.
I figured.
"- Yeah, vanilla's my favorite."
"It has to be really good vanilla, though."
"You should, um, check out the place down the street, in the mini-mall on Olamar."
Best shakes in town.
- What if they are ghosts?
- There are no ghosts.
That's enough.
"If they are alive, they must be exhausted."
We'll easily catch them.
- We must try to capture them alive.
- Why?
I want to finish them off.
Over here.
I can see them.
Give me that.
Stupid bitches.
- They've gone.
- They're in one of the wrecks.
We can't search all the wrecksl
"Did you see anything, Bosco?"
I haven't seen them.
They must still be here.
- We must wait until daybreak.
- We'll find them eventually.
I know how to drive them out.
"Paul, bring your lamp."
"Come here, all of you."
Le Bosco has an idea.
You come down too!
- Hurry up.
- Let's go.
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to burn them.
Give me your lantern.
Stay here and tell me if you see them.
Bosco!
Who's gonna read me a story?
"Just read it yourself, OK?"
Not now.
OK.
Well?
Tell me his name.
(Sighs)
It doesn't matter now.
I'm back here in the loving bosom of the family.
"Yes, it does matter."
Who did you screw?
13-1.
Yep.
"Good, see ya."
The PDO's sent you a murder.
"Hey, you know we're out of this room tomorrow."
"A street kid, tortured and murdered."
There goes all the fun.
I don't mind adults whacking each other but this stuff twists you.
So Barney will meet you in remand.
Barney's instructing?
"That's good, isn't it?"
Yeah.
Good.
He'll meet you there.
Did you know the deceased?
Had you had an argument with him?
Had he tried to rob you?
Provoke you?
Had you had sex with him?
I'm not into boys.
You're currently living in a shelter in Abbotsford.
I always loved watching him sleep.
I take it you're setting out for Candor in the morning?
Yeah.
"Listen, I only want what's best for him."
You hardly even know him.
"You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?"
"But deep down, I think you're scared"
I know him all too well.
I'm not scared.
Of course you are.
You're scared he'll finally see you for what you really are.
Deadly.
You don't believe me?
Ask him.
(PANTING)
FOUR:
You okay?
Yeah.
You sure?
Yeah.
I'm not coming with you guys.
What?
To Candor.
I'm not coming with you guys.
What are you talking about?
What's your plan?
You guys are gonna find the rest of Dauntless.
Then what?
"You attack Erudite, assassinate Jeanine, start a civil war?"
"I'm sorry, I'm just not..."
I'm not cut out for that.
I'm not like you guys.
Have some coffee.
It'll wake you up.
can we have the check?
What are you doing?
I got to go.
We just got here.
I got that thing.
We'll leave together.
one at a time.
I couldn't stand him.
I thought he was really obnoxious.
He kept fidgeting around.
do you?
That's very annoying.
but it'd look funny on my table.
Ready?
Lighten up.
We just got here.
What are you doing?
he was pushing me into the car thenpullingme out.
Itwasridiculous.
Diane and Tommy made us promise to meet them again on Friday.
We agreed.
Henry stood me up.
I feel terrible.
I don't know where he is.
He really liked you.
All he did was talk about her.
We were a trio instead of a double date.
He should have called.
I hope it's nothing serious.
But I made Tommy take me looking for him.
"Come on, we must get him out of here."
Hurry up.
Careful.
Take it easy.
Shit!
Let's go - they've mined the entire dam!
They're running away.
Let's go!
Come on!
The whole place is going to blow up!
"Come on, get over there!"
Get away from there!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Careful.
- Dad!
Dad!
"- What happened, Pablito?"
- I saw men with guns.
- Were they soldiers?
"No, revolutionaries."
They're coming to our village.
- What do they want?
- Let's wait and see.
We are your friends.
I hope you know that.
We'll march on soon.
All we're asking for is provisions and water.
"We'll rest a bit, and then we'll march on."
"My village is poor, but we'll share."
I love these gushing receptions.
Really charming.
The usual way.
Somebody pointed a gun at her and pulled the trigger .
Who?
It's complicated.
"Well, it all kind of makes sense now."
Why ?
You talked about her in you sleep some times.
I do ?
Yea.
Dreaming Flowers
Vi ?
"Yeah, man"
I can't wait until we get the dresses.
Things are going to change for us after that.
Oh hell yeah !
Do we need to chain it up?
Nah.
This'll do .
If you touch you DIE
Cool?
Cool.
This really is the last time I'm going to say this to you...
Okay ?
Or anything else.
I don't want you to send me anything anymore.
I don't...
I threw out the flowers.
You can't fix it!
And I'm really done with you.
"I don't want to talk to you again, I don't want to hear from you again."
I want you to leave me alone.
Please .
That cave...
I feel cold.
That place... it is strong with the dark side.
"Mm, a domain of evil, it is."
In you must go.
What's in there?
Only what you take with you.
Your weapons... you will not need them.
"Yeah, whatever."
"What's good, Robert?"
!
What's really good?
!
Aah!
"That's right, Robert!"
I'm you!
Aah!
"I can't believe you going out like this, granddad."
"Nigga, hush!"
"Uh, yes, I-I just want to make sure that the sergeant know it's Robert Freeman."
"I'm at the mall, and I'm gonna be attacked by this crazy nigga at any time."
Okay?
So they're on their way?
"Okay, just making sure."
"Granddad, you do this, you really gonna be a bitch-ass nigga."
"I mean, I shouldn't be surprised 'cause if I Google ""bitch nigga,"" I'll find you, but damn!"
Ow!
I'm afraid to show my face!
"Hey, look who's coming."
"Go home, old man!"
You're a loser!
- [Cheers and applause
"Come in, please."
I know you.
"No, I do not think so."
Yes.
"In the university, you helped me to put fiancee in a taxi, you were very amiable."
You decide to me very well.
Why have you come?
"I will see, I..."
-You want that I take a look at you?
truth?
-Yes.
I am very badly.
"Please,"
Get undressed.
-Also...?
-Yes.
Lie down.
tell me?
what happens to you?
"I have you feel nauseous, fatigue, lack of appetite."
We are going to auscultate the heart.
You seems to me a little excited.
This tightens much to me.?
It matters to him?
Please.
Thus I am more comfortable.
We see.
"Yes, very it is excited"
It excuses.
"Nowadays, the bra, they make them very small."
Thus it is well?
We are going to see where hurts to you.
"No, it's not."
So now you're gonna be a gentleman?
(WHISPERING) Giants can smell blood.
And I'm always a gentleman.
(CORK POPS)
(CORK THUDS)
(GASPING) Ah!
What the hell is that?
It's rum.
Bloody waste of it.
(EMMA PANTING)
Here's the plan.
We wait for the giant to fall asleep.
"When he does, we'll sneak past him into his cave."
That's where the treasures are.
Where the compass lies.
And then?
And then we run like hell.
I don't have time to wait for a giant to fall asleep.
"The powder Mulan gave us, we need to use it."
We've gotta knock him out.
That's riskier.
Than waiting for a giant to fall asleep when we need him to?
Point taken.
"Ooh, you're a tough lass."
You'd make a hell of a pirate.
"Who's Milah, on the tattoo?"
Someone from long ago.
Where is she?
She's gone.
Gold.
Rumplestiltskin.
It's just the end of the quarter.
You remember how that was.
But I am earning double time.
There's a bright side.
"So, when the laziest boy in the world wakes up, tell him he better wash those sneakers."
"And I said ""Bye."""
And tell him to let them air dry this time.
I don't want them banging the hell out of my dryer.
What?
"What, you don't even get casual Saturday?"
"No, it's just you..."
You look nice is all.
"It's work, Walt."
Everybody's gonna be there.
Ok.
Maybe we'll order a pizza tonight?
Ok.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Hi.
"You've reached Walt, Skyler, and Walter Junior."
"Please leave a message, and we'll get back to you."
Skyler?
Are you there?
I... don't know what to do.
I need to talk to you.
"Hey, Marie."
It's me.
What's up?
Yesterday I got home and found him.
He didn't even tell me he was coming.
- A man was killed?
"Hi there, Billy, how ya doing?"
Glad to meet you.
I heard a lot about you.
"Oh, here."
"I'll take it, it's my mom's."
Okay.
"Well, uh, how was your trip?"
Fine.
"Uh, did ya sit by the window?"
Yeah.
"Billy, tell Mike what you saw."
"I don't know, a bunch of clouds."
"Billy, come on, you saw the Grand Canyon."
"Hey, hey, you saw the Grand Canyon?"
"We're going to see the Grand Canyon from the ground, up close."
"Really, it's one of the most spectacular sights in the whole world."
So is Central Park.
Are we going to spend our whole vacation here?
"No, I'm with you, come on."
Wait 'til you see the trip I got planned for us.
- You're going to love it.
- I hope so.
"Listen to me, I'm telling you this city has grown a whole lot since you've left here."
"- I can tell, it's amazing."
"- Oh, yeah."
"I sell some lots, you know."
I sold some parcels out here.
I've contributed to its growth.
- Really?
"- Oh, yeah."
"- Big, big lots?"
"- Oh, yeah, oh, huge."
This is what I'm talking about.
What is up with you?
Nothing.
It's just...
Fresh margs!
This is some weak margarita.
Whatever.
You're the lightweight.
"Oh, ho, ho, say it over here."
Come here.
I hope your parents never come home.
"Seriously, dawg, let's find that punk's trailer park and burn it to the ground."
Who dat?
That freak from Chino.
He was all up in Luke's grill.
Maybe he's on OxyContin.
OxyContin is gnarly.
I heard he's like a total psycho.
He's a little bitch.
"I see that kid around again, I'm going to beat his ass."
"Yeah, run him out of Newport for sure."
I gotta go.
Hey wait up.
Where you going?
I can't be here right now.
What's the matter?
You don't know him.
You don't know anything about him.
He could be anywhere.
"Dad, I'm sure Ryan's fine."
We should just try again when it's light out.
Could be too late by then.

- I have your mail.
Put it on the shelf.
"So you said in your e-mail that you have a dance background, but you're just a bit out of shape."
Right?
"Well, I haven't played as much paddle as I used to."
That's not exercise.
Lose the bag.
So I'm gonna give you a beat.
"And you're gonna show me what I'm working with, okay?"

I'd meet the children of the woman I portrayed...
Do you know where he is?
Maurice?
Why?
Do you want to tell him that Jonah's dead?
It'd kill him.
If he's still alive he's probably in Marseille.
The last time I saw him was in Marseille years ago.
"In a restaurant, of course."
"I actually remember the restaurant. ""Beirut""."
"Lebanese food, nice restaurant."
But that was long ago.
Do you have a picture of him?
"No, I threw it away."
Or tore it up.
You know how a broken heart is.
You do all sorts of things that you regret later-.
Be a little like me.
How?
I don't even know who you are.
Just tell Ricky the truth.
"Get rid of the cigarette, there's no smoking here-."
You talk to me about truth...
Now you're a movie star.
Te-bell Hi-bick-i-by the-be tru-buth. (Tell Ricky the Truth)
And what about me?
And what about me?
And what about me?
And what about me?
And what about me?
And what about me?
And what about me?
Was he on his way to tell me that he loved me?
What should I do if he wasn't?
"Gil Da Ran,"
I love you.
He was probably going to say it like that to you.
Alright then.
Is that so?
"It would be so, right?"
"If it's like that, I worried uselessly."
Like a fool!
"Yeah, yeah."
Like a fool.
Let's pack up your clothes!
This color suits Yoon Jae very well.
This color is good too!
This one matches well too.
"Here, go pack it up."
I'll go get a bag.
Does she like Seo Yoon Jae that much?
"Aish, what's this?"
Are these the keys for this house?
No.
Is it the contracted room for us after we get married?
What should we do?
"Wait a moment, and go answer the phone naturally."
What?
Hello?
"Oh, Yoon Jae."
- It's Se Young.
- So you were home?
- The doctor friend that you saw at the hospital.
I was so worried because you didn't answer your phone.
- Yes.
- Listen.
- Yes.
See that boy sitting there.
Yes Big Boss.
- Give one to him too.
- Yes.
I don't have money.
I didn't ask for it.
I'm as old as your father.
Take it as my blessings.
Here.
Take it son.
Hey boy.
Won't you thank the Big Boss?
Offering water to the thirsty is a good deed.
And you've earned a merit because of me.
So should I be thanking him or will he thank me?
I must admit.
He's no ordinary boy.
Because he talks about common sense.
I forgot Lallan.
Even a bag of rice has pebbles.
And you Dushyant.
Why don't you setup a cracker-shop?
Maybe you'll do good business?
You made a big mistake... taking up enmity with Dushyant.
No guns.
I'll hack you to pieces with this axe...
And all of North India... won't be able to put you back.
Hey boy let's go.
Stop.
-I didn't say a thing.
What you can be sure is I'm not telling you the whole truth.
Tell me about Daniel.
-Daniel?
Yes.
Don't think I've forgot.
I told you he's 18 and he's studying economics.
I know that already.
What else?
Don't think I know much more.
Then when you meet...
He says:
"""I'm 18 and I'm studying economics."""
He doesn't have that voice!
And you answer him:
"""That's nice!"
"I like you."""
You're so foolish.
You guys must talk about something.
-Yes.
"A lot of things, sure."
Can't you tell me anything?
I wouldn't know how to repeat them.
Right.
I'm your father and we can't talk in the same way.
No.
We can talk the same but no.
It's not the same.
It's different.
I can't figure this out...
What?
Nothing.
"and on top of that, my little timmy has a black eye for the christmas portrait this year because harley was too busy saving your butt, instead of walking him home from town."
"and i'm sorry i said ""butt."""
okay?
don't say that.
mommy is mad.
- bob!
are you gonna say anything?
!
"- she does have a point, cind."
- [scoffs] fine. fine.
[sighs] you know what?
"i don't need any of you guys, okay?"
"and, peepers, i'm really sorry about your eye."
- is aunt cindy mad at me?
"[door slams] - it's okay, honey."
just -- just eat.
"let's just wash the day off of us, okay?"
none of this happened.
[siren wailing]
- [sighs] hey!
what are you doing here?
"- oh, uh... nothing."
"i'm just -- um, just, uh, cutting school."
- oh!
"well, you seen wayne?"
- no.
why -- why would i have seen wayne?
- 'cause he works here.
"- well, um... yeah."
"no, i... i haven't seen him."
- okay. cool.
"there you are, my little worker bee."
This was a dream come true.
I'd landed a custom '66 Mustang.
There you go.
All right.
Thank you.
[ Engine turns over ] There you go.
I knew I had to go easy on her if I wanted a good tip.
But I had to take a shot.
How drunk are you?
[ Laughs ]
"Had a few, I'd say, at least."
[ Engine revs ]
"Oh, I will have you home in no time, my friend."
Done.
[ Laughs ]
"I don't want you to baby this thing, all right?"
You have nothing to worry about.
Seriously.
[ Both laugh ]
"Oh, that's sweet."
This was great.
"If I could just keep him happy and not wreck his car, a healthy tip would be in my future."
Don't baby that clutch.
Come on.
Give it a little gas.
[ Engine revs ]
[ Tires screech ]
Perfect.
[ Laughs ]
There's no way Rutledge was having this much fun.
You're the best driver that I have had yet.
Wood:
Johnny was she sleeping with him?
"If I'd have seen something like that, I would tell you."
You think that maybe he was just an old friend?
That's all there was?
We didn't talk.
He didn't seem impressive.
I handed him an envelope.
- He wasn't?
- No.
He's gone and he knows not to come back.
"You know, that would be just like her."
"You see, you know, always looking to help someone."
"I'm dying, John."
- You okay?
- Yeah.
"It's gonna be okay about this guy, so forget about it."
- I let Jimmy down.
"- No, you didn't."
He's gonna die now...
- ...and he thinks I don't love him.
"- Listen to me, he knows you love him."
"And all he wanted was a little more time, where it didn't hurt so bad."
And he's gonna get it.
WEXLER:
Robin?
Yeah?
WEXLER:
You got my soup?
KELLY:
"Go ahead, you'll be fine."
"Yeah, Jimmy, just a sec."
[HELICOPTER BLADES whirring ]
You want to see the way little boys kiss?
"Well, that's nice, Wilbur."
This comes a little later.
Now cut that out!
What's wrong with you?
"Oh, oh, nothing's wrong."
I was just trying to show you what I shouldn't do.
"Well, that's right."
That's what you shouldn't do.
(BELL RINGING) No.
"Well, I..."
I must go.
"I hope you won't forget our little talk, Willy."
"No, I won't forget, Aunt Nancy."
(DOOR CLOSING)
"Goodbye, Uncle Bob."
"Now, wait a minute."
I want to have a little talk with you.
"Oh, oh, I can't."
Natalie has me until 4:30.
Natalie can wait.
Why don't you straighten up?
"Oh, I am straightened up."
It's just that my shoulders are stupid.
"That's funny, I got stupid shoulders."
I have to go.
"Now, look."
It's possible I could have had you all wrong.
Had me all wrong?
"Maybe you are a nice, simple, warm-hearted kid after all."
"Yeah, and a loyal, trustworthy pal."
That's right.
Kelly?
- Kelly Donovan.
- Jen!
I heard you were back in town.
Used to babysit me.
- And then I used to party with her.
- This woman is crazy.
- Not as crazy as you.
- Not anymore.
"- Well, sit, drink."
"- Uh, I shouldn't."
"I'm responsible now, haven't you heard?"
"- Take a night off, it's good for the soul."
- Great for the soul.
"Oh, wow."
- This is not gonna end well.
- Can't wait.
I hate this house.
It's better than the tomb.
I didn't stay locked up for 145 years to end up locked up here.
Maybe you should quit complaining.
- You gonna stop me?
"- Let it be, Frederick."
- You heard what Pearl said.
- I don't care what Pearl said.
"What you got, boy?"
Try that again.
Back off.
Back off.
- We don't fight each other.
- I want out of this house.
- Why can't we go into town?
"The will, adding me to the company."
He's been lying to both of us this entire time.
Who is that?
I don't want to sell this house.
Me neither.
"Wait, stop."
- What is it?
- Mm.
Oh.
I just thought we were good.
You're right.
It's too soon.
Sorry.
You should be.
For thinking I want some lame missionary position.
"There's just something about bedroom sex that's... so predictable, you know?"
"So... so ""old married couple."""
I'm just a girl who's more into... surprises.
You're right.
Beds are for sleeping.
We were married?
I had no idea.
Oh.
"Oh, don't stop."
Don't stop.
Don't move.
Shit.
Who is it?
Hope this isn't a bad time.
"The phone, Adriana."
"You need something, call."
But then I wouldn't get to see your beautiful face.
Kevin.
I'm Frank.
Brad.
-Hey.
"-Oh, hey."
"Oh, God."
"Come on, come in."
Excuse me.
What do we do now?
Just ask her to...
you know.
You kids see a lot of hookers?
"No, this is our first one."
Why do you have a picture of Grace Kelley?
'Cause I'd like to be like her:
Marry a prince and never get old.
"When you take your clothes off for money, do you get cold?"
Depends on the room.
"I have this dream that I'm naked at school, and I have to get home without anyone seeing me."
"I have that dream, too."
"Last time I had that dream, there was an alligator chasing me."
You ever get that one?
Nope.
Do you ever watch cartoons?
Yes.
Are you married?
"Boy, you ask a lot of questions."
The meter's ticking.
She's on the bed.
She's on the bed!
"Now, how do you want to do this:"
standing up or on the bed?
Is that what you want?
"If we stay around here, we're dead."
You got it?
We're dead.
They're right.
You took too much of that stuff.
You're totally paranoid.
How's he doing?
Busting his balls or what?
He's okay.
They sobered him up.
Good.
Very good.
Glad to hear it.
You know what kind of questions they're asking him?
"Jimmy, I don't know."
I got my mind on so many other things.
I got no money...
The girls are old enough to read the newspapers.
Tell him he's got to call me.
Okay?
"As soon as you talk to him, e's got to call me."
It's very important.
He doesn't know I came here to see you.
It's like he's crazy.
- Take this.
It's a couple of thousands.
"- Thanks, Jimmy."
"Don't worry, everything will be all right."
I got some beautiful Dior dresses.
You want to have them?
Pick out a few for yourself.
You're right.
Poor Dori.
Dori!
He's running faster.
Great!
Dori.
Did you kick me?
"No, I was just running."
What's wrong?
I don't know what's happened.
It's weird.
What's the matter?
Are you in pain?
I think it's a muscle cramp.
Can't move at all.
Really?
You can't move?
No.
"Dori, come here."
"Oh no, what shall I do?"
It's very swollen.
The doctor really said you don't need to be looked at?
"Yeah, he's my relative so he wouldn't lie."
He said an unused muscle snapped.
We have unused muscles in our body?
I don't know.
Maybe it's like an appendix.
He says it'll be very painful only for a week.
Lucky I don't have to go to the hospital.
But shouldn't you see a doctor at least once?
Is talking on the phone enough?
Don't worry.
"He's got a couple of fractured ribs, maybe his sternum too."
Set up for a chest tube.
Pratt.
"Trauma panel, type and cross four units."
- He could've bagged his spleen.
"- Look, I'll get the other one."
- We need you here.
- We'll be there.
"- Now, Gallant."
- It's cool.
It's not cool.
Hurry the hell up.
"- Come on, let's go."
- You've got two doctors.
That's enough.
We've got a critical patient who needs rapid assessment and prompt treatment.
What's the matter?
Forget what happened earlier and do your job.
- I
- I can't help that guy.
"- This is what we do, all right?"
"Now, get your ass in there."
Come on.
Come on.
"John, it's beautiful."
Absolutely beautiful.
Marriage can be a great thing.
- Can be.
- Yeah.
What the hell do I know?
Mine failed.
For many reasons.
Biggie was as rough as you're now!
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
Don't come back without the money!
"""Pochilam"""
Which one is Huang Fei-hung?
- Excuse me...
- I'm the king fu instructor for the navy!
What do you want?
Are you blind?
Just wait a second please.
No!
Please.
Sit here.
Let me examine you.
"Don't hurt me, or I'll beat you up!"
You want a fight?
That's fine with me.
Stop!
That's no way to treat a patient!
"I as just arranging your seat, Master."
What's wrong with you?
I feel uncomfortable from head to toe!
I'm Huang Fei-hung.
I'll examine you.
Let me warn you first.
I've crippled several of my doctors!
Your pulse is weak!
Can you do something about it?
Of course!
No problem!
Back to normal now!
That's hilarious.
Get me some soup.
Yep.
Uh-oh.
"Thequestionis ,willthe  House pass the bill as amended?"
This is a 15-minute vote.
"Oh, my God."
My ass is killing me from that shot.
But I feel pretty good.
Really?
- Ma'am.
- What?
"Oh, boy."
Here we go.
It's like I want my baby to live.
I don't want my baby to die.
"Maybe think of it more of as a bill, which in a very real way is what it is."
- Mm.
- There's Pierce.
He even walks dumb.
"Every time I see him, I hear circus music."
"Come on, Owen."
"It's your time to shine, you dim fucking bulb."
- He voted no.
We lost the vote.
- Oh!
We are victorious in defeat.
We may allow ourselves a brief period of rejoicing.
"Okay, so I lost the vote."
I won by not winning.
"God, I don't know how I feel."
"Apart from, like, having a raccoon take a shit in my head."
You still want to play charades?
Yeah.
I got to go.
(laughs) Really?
Mm-hmm.
Parker.
"You know, I can help you, Doc, with your ex."
(chuckles)
"No, you can't."
"Oh, yeah, I can."
I need to go home and check my judgment.
It's about Wickes again?
You were right about the tell.
He looked at that photo for a reason.
"Yeah, he did."
That's not enough.
"So, you were wrong about the guy."
No one here likes you any less.
"I want to stop running, Gibbs."
Really see the people around me and not just blurs as I fly by.
Really see them.
I just don't know if I can.
Not yet.
"I'm here, Doc."
I know.
(clears throat)
"== sync, corrected by elderman =="
Previously on Dance Academy...
Our problem is with your kind.
You're a second-year in a first-year leotard and we don't like the second-years.
"Even if there was a moment, we've probably missed it, so there's no point in..."
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.
I didn't mean--
- Don't bother.
It's not worth it.
What do you think?
It's not very good.
It's not very...
Buckley.
"It's not your fault, you know."
It really isn't.
"You'd better go home, Mrs. Cole."
Exterior train.
Station.
"A full moon, a clear sky."
A man sits by the shore.
There has been a quarrel.
A woman is walking away from him.
Now she turns back.
"""I didn't mean what I just said."
"And, anyway, you said worse."""
It was a declaration.
"- ""Stupid bloody fool"" was good."
Did you think of that beforehand?
"Are you trying to pick a fight with me, Mrs. Cole?"
No.
What I'm trying to say is that... if all of this stopped... the sparring and the jibing and the insults and the arguments...
I'd miss it.
"Even if I were dead,"
I'd still miss it.
The Catrin Cole School of Dialogue.
On and on and on and on and on.
I totally forgot to order it without peppers.
Yeah.
Even though I told you seconds before that I hated green peppers.
- My head still must be a little fuzzy.
- Must be.
So what kind of food does Bo like?
- Nothing special.
She seems like someone who'd like a good steak.
- Maybe.
- What's Bo's favourite restaurant?
We don't really eat out much.
...We..?
- Yeah.
"""We"" this, ""we"" that."
"You're pretty much right in there with Bo, huh?"
"Right by her side, day in, day out."
Yeah.
"You know, we're kind of a team."
Is that healthy?
"I mean, don't you want to branch out on your own one day so that both of you can flourish?"
- Yeah.
"You know, you're totally right."
I'm actually planning on going back to school and getting my law degree.
"Oh, law."
- That's so great.
- Yeah. it's so great.
- Gotta pee.
- Okay.
"Oh, jeez."
"On, shit."
"Oh, my God."
"On, God."
I told them not to come.
There wasn't any point if you weren't there with me.
[soft guitar music]
A girlfriend!
"Hey... oh, right."
A girlfriend among us!
We have been infiltrated!
Hello. [laughs nervously]
"Oh, my bros, my bros, my bros!"
This place is too dope!
They can't let it last!
There's only one option left.
Get the Kool-Aid.
[men cheering] Yeah!
Now mix it with the vodka.
"Quickly, now."
"Shots, my bros!"
It is the only way.
[slamming podium] We must do shots!
[men clamoring]
"Shots, shots, shots, shots!"
"The younger bros first, then the eldest."
Do you want to get out of here?
"Well, you... you don't want to hang out with Mike anymore?"
Uh...
"Oh, mother, mother, mother, mother, please."
"No, let's..."
let's go back to my place.
- Okay.
- Um... ♪ ♪
Let's go back to our place.
- Okay.
Still want to take Barry's place?
"- Get out of here, Barry."
- I'll go get a teacher.
You want to go?
"I'm not gonna fight you, Dirk."
Why not?
You chicken?
Come on!
No.
Get up!
Get up!
- Come on!
Get up!
"- Hey, get back!"
Get back.
That is enough.
"So long, Barry Cook."
You all right?
Barry was my friend.
I just burned his bones.
"Well, he's at peace now, Sam."
"I mean, if dad had let us stay just a little while longer, maybe I chould have helped the kid, you know?"
You read the coroner's report same as me.
Barry was on every anxiety drug and antidepressant known to man.
School was hell for that kid.
His parents had split up.
He just wanted out.
"It was tragic, but it's not your fault."
"To tell you the truth,"
I'm glad we got out of that town.
I hated that school.
It wasn't all bad.
Hi.
"Terribly sorry, officer, but this is actually my car."
I'm...
"I'm trying to, uh, teach my girlfriend how to drive stick."
She's got a lot to learn.
I know.
"But, you know... women."
"All right, I hear you."
It's a warning... this time.
Yeah.
Thank you so much.
"What are you, some sort of a misogynist?"
You're welcome.
"Oh, go."
We got lucky.
"""We""?"
"This isn't your car either, is it?"
Hmm?
I stole a stolen car?
Now how about that drink?
(Engine starts)
(Birds chirping)
"All due respect, I'm the best-equipped to go."
- How many wars have you been through?
- My share.
- It should be me.
- You?
You haven't fought in a battle.
This is about us getting home to our loved ones.
- Why would you...
- Because I have no loved ones.
"If I fail, you can still go on."
-Aliens.
What?
-All this for nothing.
They abandoned us.
"Folks, the sea is frozen."
It is impossible the aliens return.
Frozen hard.
Frozen hard.
"If the sea is so far, we will take as food."
"Than before die hunger, too."
-I better go.
-We can not let them.
-I think they'll leave.
-It seems that we ...
"I must inform you that the Adelie, not help us anymore."
And who will bring us fish?
"Some good questions, has no good answer."
"Sven can not leave us, not now."
"I'm sorry, fofuxo."
If they also get no longer be alive.
I can not stand ...
Do not take it anymore.
Get away from me.
I'll leave.
-That crazy guy!
Me too.
We girls let's jump.
"Sven, teach them, teaches them to fly."
Erik is not so easy.
Help them Sven help them.
"But not all Penguin is equal, Erik."
But you're a penguin.
"Look, I don't..."
I don't care.
Shut up.
Get in here.
- What are you doing?
- Let's go.
- Pull down your pants.
- What?
Don't ask questions.
- Shove these in your underwear.
- Why?
You want me to do it?
"'Cause, I swear to God, I will."
- Why can't we leave it in the bag?
- Because it shows up on the scanner.
"And we're not about to have them confiscate $250,000."
"$250,000?"
- No.
Why do I have to do it?
- 'Cause you're the donkey boy.
You really suck at not asking questions.
What's a donkey boy?
"- Step forward, sir."
- Thanks.
"- In the basket, please."
- There's a table when you get to the line.
"Act casual, think casual, be casual."
"Remove your keys, any metal objects."
"Laptops out, please."
Thank you.
"If you have liquids in a Ziploc bag, please show them to us now."
- Thank you.
- We need to smash things all over your body.
- Yes!
- No.
- Yes.
- We need to build up your tolerance to beatings.
- Hence the smashing.
"- We used a trash can, but Dennis wanted to use a chair."
- I think he's ready.
- That's way too excessive at this point.
- That guy's ready.
- He's not ready for a chair.
"- I'm tellin' you, he's ready."
Hey!
Guys!
I can handle a chair.
Go get a chair.
See what you're doing to him?
You're getting him all worked up.
- He's the toughest guy we know.
"- Yes, he is, but he..."
"Hey, Mac!"
"Get a chair, smash it on my back."
That's the right attitude.
He's got the right attitude.
I'll tell you what.
"Charlie, go put on those little short-shorts."
- Let's take things to the next level.
- Yeah.
- But first things first.
Let's get good and drunk.
- Let's get drunk!
- Whoa!
Sure.
"- Hello, Ed."
How are you?
Why haven't you called me up?
Why...
Uh...
Our phone's out of order.
"- Well, you could have come to see me."
- No.
"No, I couldn't."
"You see, the girl I'm engaged to wouldn't like it."
So long.
"Say, was he trying to insult me?"
"Oh, no worry about that."
It's nothing.
You know the old saying:
"""Is just as many good fish in the ocean as there ever was. """
Fish in the ocean.
"There she is, boy."
Give her the gun.
"Yeah, what's the hurry?"
"Well, they told us to step on it."
You know what Joe says.
They got enough orders to paper this shop.
Oh.
Dombrowski said.
"Hey, what's the matter with you?"
- That's the fourth drill you've burnt up.
"- Well, what's it to you?"
Dombrowski's trying to sweat a record out of us.
"Listen, Frank, get down to work and quit knocking Joe."
Let her down.
How do you know?
I
Were you there?
It was tricked by lights guiding it into the rocks.
- To cause a shipwreck?
On purpose?
- Of course it was on purpose.
Shut up.
You know very well there are no wreckers anymore.
Who knows?
The tide may have washed up the bodies.
I asked you if you were there.
- What about you?
Were you there?
- Me?
No.
I was herel
"So, why have you got blood on your shirt?"
You're crazy.
There's nothing there.
God curse the wreckers!
The sun is rising over the shore!
A sad and gray day!
The tide is out!
I can see two small figures.
They are getting up!
- They start walking.
- That's enough!
- Shut up!
- They are still weak.
They support each other and stagger forward.
Be warned.
We got from now on to celebrate.
"- I'm not hungry, Mrs. Grogan."
- You've got to eat.
All you had for lunch was a can of tomatoes.
Go on and eat.
"- Oh, don't worry."
I'll be over this tomorrow.
- You will if you stay home tonight.
- Yeah.
"- Never mind, I'll get it."
Hello?
Oh.
"Just a moment, please."
"Ed, it's for you."
Mrs. Danvers.
"- Thanks, Betty."
"- You're welcome, I'm sure."
Hello?
"Hello, Eddie."
"Oh, I'm fine."
I just wanted to find out how you were.
Huh?
"Oh, gee, that's too bad."
"Say, it must have been the gin chasers."
It couldn't have been the beer.
"Oh, I just called up to tell you I'm not mad about what you said last night."
No.
"Well, you know, about our not having any more dates."
"No, I've forgiven you already."
Uh-huh.
I couldn't stay mad at a swell guy like you.
"Well, that's fine."
- Lucy...
- Yes?
"Lucy, I..."
"I don't know what you're expecting tonight, but I..."
I...
I think you should know that...
"Mama, I do know."
"Goodbye, Mother."
"Goodbye, Daddy."
Bye.
"Billy, you missed your tea."
"And you, Faber."
Have something at the pub.
- Thanks.
I'll just have a wash.
- See you there.
"- Freddy, can I come?"
- I don't know about that.
- You in the army yet?
- Tell him about that miracle cream.
"Oh, yeah."
Will you tell Mrs Garden I'll be late?
My mate Harry's got this cream that takes all the pimples off...
"Mr Faber, I've kept a nice piece of meat pie warm for you."
- We mustn't let that go to waste.
"- Not with this rationing, we mustn't."
I'll be down in a minute.
"24 hours isn't very long for a honeymoon, is it?"
We can start right now.
There's a bottle of bubbly down there.
So there is.
- There we are.
"Master Y an, Master Zhou has been slain"
The body is lying outside
"Dad, don't know who did it this time?"
"Brother Y an, you see!"
You see!
Who killed him?
Who killed him?
Who did that?
"Brother Y an, what should we do?"
"That's right, Brother Y an, what should we do?"
What should we do?
Let's go!
"Go, go!"
"Wait, it'll be dangerous for us to stay here!"
What do you mean?
"If we stay here, we'll be killed all the same!"
I guess we should leave tomorrow!
T omorrow?
Now!
The bad guys of the boxing world
"I'm sorry, did I scare you all?"
How come everyone is here?
You want to flee?
Leaving Y an Qingwang here all by himself?
He'll be lonely!
So it's you!
It's too late now to know!
No wonder you look like a pig!
"Y an Qingwang, why are you so late?"
You should've come sooner to see my act
"You bastard, since you're here!"
My brothers died suddenly
I envy you. with the nonsense that comes out of their mouths...
Makes you wonder the whole point of it all.
Shit.
Don't worry.
We won't need it.
Stay here.
Mr. Munson.
What brings y'all this way?
Why don't you ask your boys? right?
I have an easement with the previous owner of your property.
Huh.
Bullshit.
"Previous"" being the operative word."
Who's this?
Just a guy telling you to get back in your nice truck.
Go play Okie dickhead somewhere else.
Carl it looks like Mr. Munson hired some muscle.
Looks that way.
He's a friend of mine.
A friend with a big mouth.
I hear that a lot.
too.
More than I'd like.
Then you know the drill.
I'mma count to three and you're gonna start walking away.
I got rights to this water.
One.
I have a lawyer now.
Two.
- Three.
- Ah.
Ah.
What's it take to get a menu here?
"Okay, I'll handle it."
That's all right.
I'll handle it.
And ruin your popularity?
"You know what, why don't you guys just sneak out the back?"
What's going on with you two?
Hey!
How's it going?
Hey!
Front door.
Hi.
"Hey, guys."
How you guys doing?
"You like the food here, too?"
It's pretty awesome.
"Shut up, queer."
"Well, at least I don't shave my chest."
What'd you say?
"Luke, come on."
I just said you look nice in a sweater vest.
It was a compliment.
"Do you want me to break you, Cohen?"
Hey!
No way.
Look who's back.
"You know, you're a little far from Eight Mile."
"Luke, don't!"
"What are you, like spokesperson for geeks of America or something?"
You know what I like about rich kids?
Nothing.
That was awesome!
That's how I ended...
That's how I ended up here.
My God.
That's why I'm here.
He was right.
Who was right?
You saw Leek.
- He was part of the warning.
- What?
He was part of the warning.
"Stop, stop, stop."
I didn't want to scare you.
He said...
He said the messages are real.
Something terrible is gonna happen.
"Connie, please."
We have to leave here now.
I will not live my life like that.
I will not make decisions based on messages from Indrid Cold.
He may be real to you.
He's not real to me.
"Okay, I'm going to Charleston."
I'll be at the Marriott.Get yourself reassigned.
I don't want you anywhere near the plant today.
What if nothing happens?
What if there's no great tragedy?
What'll you do then?
- That's not the point.
"- Well, I think it is the point."
- Gordon believed what he heard too.
- I am not Gordon!
I know.
Right now!
Geez.
It's 11:29 at the tone.
Bing!
That's 56 minutes.
That's my best time yet.
"And I know I could do better on the road, because this last stretch of beach is all soft sand."
"What do you think this is, a gymnasium?"
"Hey, man, you stay in pretty good shape, huh?"
About how many miles do you jog a day?
Only eight.
Eight.
Hmm.
Mm-hmm.
"Uh, you swim a lot too, huh?"
Now and then.
I bet you can ride a bike pretty good.
Bicycle?
"T.C.,"
I am not in training to enter the Iron Man contest.
Honest.
A guy'd have to be crazy to do that.
"First you swim five miles, then you marathon 26 miles, then ride a bike a hundred miles all in the same day."
"Yeah, this is Rick."
I bet you could do it.
No bet.
Okay.
"Thomas, that was Jimmy at the gate."
There's a woman here to see you.
This has gotta stop.
"I mean, as Higgins would say, this is a private club, not an office."
Not an office.
- Why not?
Because I beat him at table tennis.
It destroyed him.
You can't do that!
That was in Italy.
That's Da...
Jørgen.
Was I silly to bring them?
"No, I'd like to see them all."
What happened back then?
Why didn't you come home?
I just didn't.
We had broken up.
"And you were drunk all the time, right?"
Yeah.
And you did her friend?
"Yep, I think I actually did that."
- Would you like dessert?
"- Yes, please."
"Jacob, I am glad you came anyway."
I thought it all through yesterday   and I became convinced we must continue.
You would like to continue?
As though nothing's happened?
"Yes, it fits even better now."
"- Well, let's try then."
- Are you hungry?
We need some lunch.
We're going to lunch.
Wasn't it strange meeting her again...
Helene?
Yes.
Don't you think she's ageing well?
Thank you.
This is good stuff.
Real good stuff.
Why are you driving me nuts?
Know how much I cried waiting for you?
You did?
I'm sorry.
Know how hard it was for me?
I was crying on the porch because of you.
Let me ask you something.
Please be honest.
Please.
"That night, when I was outside, what were you doing in the room?"
I'm getting sick of this.
It's that again?
I don't know.
Don't know anything anymore.
"Joongrae, don't lie to me."
"Please, don't lie."
Do whatever you want.
What did I do so wrong to deserve this?
What did I do?
I'm sick of it all.
"What's wrong with you, Moonsook?"
That's not important.
Somebody walked over me.
"You two walked over me, huh?"
"When I was outside, you two walked over me."
"I thought I was dreaming, but it was real."
I don't believe this.
"Walk over me, did you?"
How dare you?
I want action plans on my desk in one hour.
Stay vigilant.
I'm not losing any more of you.
Now I got to go call krzeminski's wife.
I'll call his girlfriend.
♪ There's a somebody I'm longing to see ♪
♪ I hope that he turns out to be ♪
♪ someone who'll watch over me
♪ I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood ♪
The usual?
"Yes, please."
♪ I know I could always be good ♪
♪ to one who'll watch over me
Anything else?
Uh... ♪ although he may not be the man ♪
I...
I thought I might
Tell you about my day if you have a moment.
"Yeah, that would be a nice change."
I got plenty of time on my hands.
All ears.
"Uh, it's just that..."
One of my co-workers died today.
"Geez, peg."
That's too bad.
Right there on the job?
"Yes, it was sudden."
I know how you feel...
blindsided.
Like when my cousin ralphie got hit by a bus.
"Granted, he did just knock off a newsstand, but still."
Big shock.
Shit.
All the cameras are down.
Audio's on a separate file.
- Yeah.
- Pull it up.
Here.
Nothing.
What time was that?
- One hour ago.
- Earlier.
Fuck you!
Do you wanna be a fucking hero?
Go back further.
We just gotta hold out a couple of hours till Emerson gets here and then I hope...
- Quiet!
- Get off of me!
- Where is she?
- Fuck you!
You go get her.
Tell her to come out.
Tell her to come out right now!
Take a fucking seat!
We know you have to open the door from the inside.
Can you get her to do that for us?
It'll be a lot easier.
Fuck you.
I need to get inside the broadcast room.
I need the girl to open the door.
I need her to take care of some numbers for me.
Now this is something only she can do.
And I'm kinda on a tight schedule.
They didn't know about the change in schedule.
"Look, you Boss told you to give me something in this replacement."
Then give me and go.
"No, How could I give you that?"
"It's not your age, Age not concerns."
"You know, how many little people has gone there."
"Look, I can't raise you up."
"I am saying, Sorry."
"I am saying, Sorry."
"You were the only Laxmi, Who was my last hope,"
"And If you betrays me, then what will happen with me?"
Think about it.
"Kill me, Kill me, Please, I want to go up."
"Kill me, Laxmi!"
"Leave me,"
"Kill me, please!"
Kill me.
Let me go.
What you've done?
We stop him to go.
"Don't touch him, He is my Laxminarayan."
"No, he's our Laxminarayan."
Who told you?
"He's our piece, He's not a piece, he's Laxminarayan."
"He's ours, He's mine."
"He's ours, He's mine."
One minute.
"Yes, Madam, Where are you?"
You know Laxminarayan was coming on 11:00.
"Yes, Madam but how could he?"
He's lay down here.
"He is not, He stands next to me."
You people come soon here.
- Come on.
"- Oh, my goodness."
Are you getting tired?
You want me to wheel you?
- No!
- All right.
- Absolutely no.
- All right.
This is a big place.
Do you know where you're going?
When we come in the first building - You come into the building -
One second.
Could it be over there?
"- Yes, it must be."
- You think it might be there?
- Yeah.
- 'Cause there's more than one entrance.
- But we're gonna look at them all.
"- Well, there's a fence there."
Let's have a look.
Do you see it here?
"- No, not here?"
"- It's downstairs, where you come in."
All right.
Let's go to the other entrance.
I think I know which one you're talking about.
This way.
- I'm thinking it might be along here.
- It's in the entrance.
"Well, let's - let's have a look here."
And he never even told me it was there.
- He didn't tell you?
I had a dog like him once.
I went to have him put down.
He jumped out of my arms at the vet's and took off for the park.
Sometimes I still think I see him out there...
... watchingme...
... gnawingonan oldbone.
Excuse me.
"Hello, Nettie."
Can I help you with the basket?
"No, no. I didn't know Frank was expecting you."
Due espressi?
.
Maybe later.
"99 out of 1 00 times, we can beat something like this."
I don't like the odds.
We go back a long way.
"I know, I know."
"I tried to close the door, Frank."
Couldn't get it shut.
-What do you want me to do?
-Take the pressure off yourself.
Here's the thing.
They'll tell you:
"""""Yeah, yeah, sure."
You have the key to the cell.
"Go ahead. """""
But you won't be able to open it without singing.
You're a singer.
"Give me a chance, and I'll show you how quiet I can be."
"It's out of my hands, Frank."
"Do the right thing, will you?"
-Make it easy for yourself.
Have a nice life.
Françoise.
Thank you.
Thomas.
You hate me.
Is that it?
You must stop calling me.
File a complaint with my insurance.
I will still call you.
Yeah.
I'll never file a complaint.
It's not my style.
I wouldn't have complained to your boss either.
You don't say.
It's obvious you love your work.
What?
I love my work?
As if fucking the disabled was a vocation.
No one forces you to do this.
- Yes.
They do.
How can you be forced into it?
I did some things.
What things?
Illegal things.
I can't talk about it.
I was given a substitution sentence.
Wait a second.
You were sentenced to being a prostitute for the disabled?
You don't have to insult me.
- No.
I'm a hostess.
- There's no problem?
- No.
Where's my camera?
"Ali, where is it?"
I haven't seen it.
Look in the glove-box.
- Wait for me.
"- Farzad, put the bread there."
"Hello, engineer."
Hello.
"Farzad, wrap up the bread or it will dry out."
Would you like tea?
"Yes, thank you."
My colleagues are sleeping.
We'll have a walk and come back.
Off you go.
Which way's your school?
This way and that.
You have two schools then?
"No, there are two paths to school."
Where's the square?
This way.
You don't mind.
"Come this way, I'll get my camera."
What a handsome white village!
"Why is it called ""Black Valley""?"
The ancestors called it that.
"Can't you call it ""White Valley""?"
"No, we have to call it by its name."
It has to stay that way.
That's how it is.
"""When you're fahed ho be black..."
"""Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!"""
Now just pump the brakes right there.
- I got a question.
- Have at 'er.
Then I got a comment.
"Well, let's hear it, good buddy."
"Now, my question."
"When have you ever heard a girl go,"
"""Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."""
- Well...
- Other than in a porno.
- I don't believe I have.
- Me neithers.
That's because we don't say that.
- Well...
- Not unless it's in a porno.
WAYNE:
Now my comment.
"You see, the way Dary did the ""yes, yes, yes, yes, yes's"""
"is not the way they do the ""yes, yes, yes"" in pornos."
That's the way they do it.
"The girl gets all excited, and she goes,"
"""Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."""
"Yes, but the way you're doing the ""yes, yes, yes, yes's"""
"is not the way they do the ""yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."""
DARYL:
It is the way they do it.
"They go, ""Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."""
- That's exactly how they do it.
- WAYNE:
"No, they don't."
What they do is they find a super-high pitch for those first four yes's.
No trouble.
- It's all good.
- All right.
Are you sure?
- Is there something I should know?
"- No, no."
Everything's good.
It's just a status check.
"Don't dawdle, stay in touch."
Kirk out.
He's fine.
So is Myka.
Okay?
Put it down on red 15.
- I got nothing.
- Nothing's going on down here either.
They're still winning and I'll be damned if I know how.
I know.
I am.
I just think that's...
- What if you put those two together...
- I don't think that's gonna work.
- What about what we tried in...
- What is that?
It's just something I whipped up.
- What do you mean?
Just now?
- That's right.
"Wait, wait."
- What are you doing?
- I'm opening a line of communications.
CIA uses laser mics to read vibrations off windows to hear what's going on on the other side of the window.
Father?
I don't understand.
you're...
You're his son?
"If my son were alive, he'd be 34 years old."
xxx
There's another one of those things out there.
Look what it did to Zaddik.
I say we go after it now!
No one's going anywhere.
We'll handle this.
Stay calm.
How is he?
"I've given him something for the pain, but his injuries are too severe."
He's not going to make it.
This can't be happening.
It's not possible.
I'm sorry.
Don't blame Ellia.
It was my idea.
"You... have to understand... that when I found her,"
I'd just lost my own wife and son to a fever.
"She was just lying there, helpless."
"When I saw her, I knew what I had to do."
"As I told you, in the beginning, she survived on food and water like any young girl."
xxx
No.
No!
It's all right.
Take what you need.
I can't.
"Yes, you can."
"I'm his wife, I have to be here!"
-We'll take care of Migs.
-His blood pressure?
"Just stay here, we'll take care of this."
We still can't be sure of the extent of the damage but he's still lucky he didn't get a fracture in the skull.
"-Doc, when is he waking up?"
-There's a lot of possible outcomes.
But I promise...
"Whatever happens to him, I'll still take care of him."
Is there anyone looking for me?
.
No one.
But I already found the man I love in the whole world.
How's Migs?
He hasn't waken up yet.
I'm sure he will wake up.
Aren't you going to visit again?
.
"You know, I'm not supposed to be there."
My son!
My son!
Brother!
Come here.
Come.
How are you feeling?
"Come, one more."
There's Joy.
Who are you?
.
I'm your wife.
I'm Joy.
I don't know her.
- I'll call you back in an hour.
Bye.
They belong together.
They've danced for the Pope.
What kind of music is that?
They brought it with them.
Who would want to listen to that?
The Pope?
How would I know?
"Man Viktor, I wanted a singer."
Ask them if they can sing.
Excuse me.
Do you have a song prepared?
"Singing, songs!"
What's this pop shit?
What's this one's name here?
-That's Angie.
"Angie, Bring me a soda."
That's going to take a little while...
"First, I have to finish up the glasses, boss."
We could forget about the girls and just do your uncle's quiz show.
Why can't she just bring me a soda when I order a soda.
She likes to do one thing after another.
"Listen Viktor, let me tell you something."
Even if the quiz show works out...
Which we have no idea about yet...
It will work out.
I want a number here with a singer.
High class!
Alright.
High... class!
I'll take care of it!
Did I have spare clothes?
I'm back.
Rin will play lacrosse!
But she's not a student.
It's impossible.
She applied for permission.
Can we order now?
please.
Rin will be fine!
She'II play lacrosse.
hello!
It's not working because you're bending your elbow.
"Rin, show us."
Let your force flow forward.
Teacher.
Manager.
Minmin.
Raw power won't do it.
"blend the power of the ball into your power, Iet them flow!"
Wow!
Saw that?
Why are you here?
It's quite an interesting sport.
"Hey, Minmin."
relax!
"With me, you don't have to practice martial arts."
Now I want to play!
Who's he?
Does it matter?
How's my lipstick?
Perfect!
Let him apply for the coach post.
"Well, I could ask you the same question."
"Yeah, well, I'm here with the make-a-wish clowns."
We're visiting the children's ward.
Who are you with?
I'm freelancing.
"Can I speak to you outside for a moment, please?"
Sure.
"All right, man, can we stop this?"
We have hit rock bottom.
I'll admit it.
I have felt better about myself.
"Now, let's just put this competition aside."
"Come on, we're friends."
We can't do this to each other.
Aah!
The poodle you ordered.
"♪ She's lump, she's lump, she's lump ♪"
♪ she's in my head. ♪

- Dr. Lonsdale.
"- Hey, Sara, what's up?"
"Oh, not much."
Just prepping for my laparoscopic fetal kidney surgery.
"Hey, have you spoken to Riley recently?"
I have.
"This morning, actually."
She broke up with me.
What?
"Oh, God, that's awful!"
- I'm so sorry.
"- No, it's okay."
"I mean, the timing was obviously bad, with her moving to Egypt for two years."
- No!
- Do you like them?
The Paki had me while I sucked off the black guy.
"By the way, his name is Lamin and he's really nice."
What shall I say at school?
My sister does porn.
- Why?
- Because I can't be a model.
- And I'm sick of school.
- Maybe I can buy up the negatives.
You think everything revolves around you.
"- Sofie, stay here!"
- There are more mags at the kiosk.
Sofie!
One more year.
Then you can do want you want.
Sofie!
"Mum, it's Sofie."
Listen.
Did you hear that?
It was your car.
You'll have to catch the bus to work.
- You fucking whore!
- I'm not a whore.
Fucking three darkies in a porn mag without telling me first!
Smashing up her car would have done the trick.
- You didn't have to do those photos.
- I did it for us.
So we could go to New York.
- Us?
We're through.
"- Don't go, Simon."
"Your serum doesn't work, father."
It never has.
That's impossible.
It's been two years since you... since the last time.
That wasn't your fault.
It was my idea.
I needed time to perfect the forumla.
But it wasn't working.
The hunger just got worse.
What did you do?
I'm sorry father.
No.
"No, that was the other one."
It was both of us.
I sensed him out there.
I knew when he was feeding and I would go out at the same time.
"No, it can't be."
Ellia!
Stay away!
What is it?
What's happening?
Let me help you.
Sheppard.
This is where he's been making camp.
He was here less than an hour ago.
You hear anything?
No.
Me either.
Easy now.
"You just went to all that trouble to save my life, it would be a shame to kill me."
"Are you alright, Rodney?"
"Yeah, I'm just peachy now."
"Okay, guys, come on."
"Let's go, seriously."
We can do that later.
- You okay?
-Yeah.
(PANTING)
"Thank you, Peter."
"Yeah, whatever."
"Now we're even, stiff."
All right.
"Come on, let's go."
Before Jeanine realizes you're still alive.
"- No, no, no."
-What?
The box.
We have to get the box.
"What, are you kidding me?"
"Now's not the time for a souvenir, Tris."
"Four, you have to listen to me."
It's not what Jeanine thinks it is.
I know it's not.
My mother would have destroyed it.
We have to get it.
"Peter, is there another way into the lab?"
"I mean, I'd have to go into the control room to disable all the doors."
"Okay, good, then do that."
Okay.
Right now?
Yeah.
"You just chose our side, whether you meant to or not."
"If you wanna survive, make sure we do."
Let's go.
!
I just told her it's a surprise for your birthday.
She was thrilled.
Where'd you get the money?
It's all on me.
- But...
"- None of your business, Dorona."
I have the money and I want to do it.
But what'll I eat there?
You're looking at a nut and that's all you care about?
I want to try and find him.
Why?
- What?
- Nothing.
- Where to?
- Paris.
He wanted to come.
And you agreed?
What did he tell you?
"Nothing, I swear."
You have separate rooms.
- And he speaks fluent French.
- So do we.
"- Yeah, like morons."
- Is he going to be with us the whole time?
I'm going home.
Shai got you business class?
Why only you?
"Don't drink too much, your legs will swell."
- When will you tell me what you did?
- When will you tell me what you did?
- Are you starting again?
"Carter, there's no way I can get my hands"
On that much cash in an hour.
Not as a private citizen.
There's nobody in the government you can ask?
No one who'd even entertain it.
"And in any case, the request would go into the system and alert the leak."
"Okay, okay."
I have an idea.
I'll get back to you.
Carter?
Hey.
So you can change.
Or I could get you something else if you want.
"- No, thanks."
- All right.
"Isaac, um... is everything all right?"
You seem...
I don't know.
It's been a rough year.
Other people wanting what's mine.
"You can always get out, you know."
Yeah.
"Look, I got a deal about to go down with some Dominicans."
Right?
They're gonna move my product on the north side.
That'll put me back on top.
I'll be a'ight.
Yeah.
What?
How's Nicole?
"She's fine, like I said she'd be."
"What, you called to talk to her?"
Claire's...
Claire's dead.
"Now, will you take that soup and get out of here."
I can't take anymore today.
"Look, all I meant was you..."
Will you just get out of here!
Sir...
And stay out!
"Sir, he didn't mean any harm, if you'll forgive me for saying so, sir."
"I sometimes have a silly effect on people, you know what I mean?"
"Just being a police lieutenant, you know."
"At least, I hope that's why."
"Yes, I'm sure it is."
"Your friend, sir."
He was just trying to be nice.
(SIGHS)
What?
Oh.
Him.
"No, no."
He wasrt trying to be nice.
He was trying to fix me up with an alibi.
Then it wasrt true?
"What, Lieutenant?"
I...
Excuse me.
I keep swimming in and out of myself.
"Well, you know, that's what happens, sir."
It's kind of like being in shock.
"Maybe you ought to sit down for a minute, sir."
I am not in shock.
I don't need to sit down.
Yes. thank you.
I'm sorry about what i said.
You don't have to apologize.
Where's chuck?
It's over... once and for all.
But i'm gonna be strong.
"Still, it doesn't feel right without him here."
You know everyone else is here.
Yeah...
Everyone's here.
Oh it's beaufiful
It looks so good on you.
Oh!
i've dreamed about this for so long.
Do you want to fire it up?
I can't. blair and I have a meeting at rouge tomate.
Huh. that's cryptic.
Both.
So how are you today?
Miserable.
But at least college
Will be the fresh start it's supposed to be.
No chuck No nate.
No anybody really.
Except gossip girl.
Forget I said that.
It's okay.
I read them too.
"""Spotted--chuck bass in france. chuck bass in germany."
"Chuck bass in italy."""
I hope he has so much fun that they have to quarantine him.
Open your present.
Was that Damon Salvatore you were with?
The one and only.
Do you know him?
We go way back.
He still live out by Miller Lane?
He lives in the old boarding house.
By Wickery Bridge.
He's still in there if you wanna say hi.
I'd rather stay here and talk to you.
Oh.
Nice.
Very smooth with the shoe and the flirt.
But I'm a little drunk.
And hot guy plus drunk me equals very bad things.
I'm pretty sure you'd like it.
I'm sorry.
That was a seriously lame pick-up.
I'm sorry.
That's a nice scent you're wearing.
What is it?
I don't know.
"Ha, ha."
It was a gift.
"And that is a cab, so..."
Vervain.
Making it hard to find something to eat in this town.
- Caroline.
- I don't wanna talk about it.
You're being ridiculous.
"And insecure and stupid, but that doesn't change the fact that Matt's in love with you and I'm the backup."
- You're not the backup.
"- Yes, I am."
- WOMAN:
Get rid of her!
-Damn right.
Except you'll have to go through me first.
"Me, too."
ALL:
And all of us.
(ALL CLAMORING)
Hey!
I ain't the one with the time bomb in my arm.
MAN:
Yeah!
(ALL SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)
(TRIS SNIFFLING)
I know what you're thinking.
But I'm not gonna let you do it.
I can't let anyone else die because of me.
No one else is gonna die because of you.
Tori's gonna find a way to disable the disks...
And if she doesn't?
Then...
Then...
"Then if she doesn't, we figure it out."
Together.
You know I'm just one person.
I'm not worth it.
"No, you are worth it."
You are worth it to me.
I love you.
JEANINE: ...plays a critical role in maintaining the social order.
But this harmony we've achieved is now under attack.
This city may be safely enclosed behind a vast wall.
"You heard what I said, keep playing."
"I told you I never wanted to see you in these parts again, Black Bart."
I'll have to blow you away.
[fires cap gun]
"I got you, fall down."
"Okay, you want to play?"
I'll play with you.
Come on out.
"Let's see if your gun's as loud as your mouth,"
Sheriff.
I'll pick where to make my stand.
[fires and giggles]
Hold it.
"Smile, cowboy."
"I got it, Harry."
[laughs]
"[Billy] Bang, bang, bang!"
Whoo-hoo.
"mom, you should of seen it."
This outlaw chased me all over and then he tried to shoot me.
But he shot the head right off this fake Indian.
- Were you scared?
- No.
"Hey, I told you you'd like it."
"Thanks for bringing me, Mom, it's excellent."
"Well, here you go, you guys."
"Uh, I'm gonna go upstairs for a while, I think."
"You have a good time, okay?"
"Uh, say, uh,"
I think we ought to talk.
"See, uh..."
I know this is real hard on you.
"No, we're not!"
This is totally legit.
"For all this guy knows, we could be mega-minted poshos in disguise."
It would be a superb disguise.
Cheers.
"Take us to the bed section, my good man."
I want to try one of them.
Mm-hm.
Security!
Agh.
This chair is like a torture device.
I've asked Flavia for one with back support so many times.
At least you get a chair.
I have to stand still all day.
Think you could stand a bit stiller?
Hard to score if you're jiggling.
I don't want you to score!
Come on!
Getting balls in your jug is the only fun part of my day.
Stop it!
Calm down.
I don't want them in my jug.
"Open your mouth, then."
Give him something to aim at.
I don't want your balls in my mouth!
"It might shut you up for once, water boy."
Sorry.
He's been trying to get balls in my jug all day.
I don't care.
Paper balls.
Stop talking.
Water man.
"So, as you can see, the mystery of who pooped the bed has been solved."
"And yes my friends, in a way, you're all guilty."
I did it.
- What?
- I did 'em all.
I did all the poops.
- Really?
"- Yeah, I did everyone of them."
"I even did one, while she was rappin us, right here."
- Dude!
- Jesus!
God!
"Why would you do that, dude?"
Because poop is funny.
I guess poop is very funny.
- Poop is funny.
- He pooped on the floor.
"You know what, well-played my man!"
Well-played!
I hate my life.
"Seriously dude, don't ever poop in our bed again."
How is it on the rooftop?
Door is locked.
Hostage situation.
"Michael, do I wait for you?"
"Don't wait, I'll tell dad!"
"Just $20, 000 in such a high-class restaurant?"
"Well, it's high-class, so we use cards."
Where's the safe?
Open it!
Why would I have the key?
I wasn't okay until now but...
I'll feel better after I meet you.
Actually I'm going out to see my brother.
He's throwing a party today.
Why don't you two come too.
He's invited influential people.
Fine send me the address.
I'll be there.
Okay I'll send it right now.

"As long as she's breathing, we've got fate up against the ropes."
There he is.
"All right, so the bike was stolen in Emeryville."
Head back towards the Bay Bridge.
Okay.
There's your man.
Go to the toll plaza.
- There!
- Yes!
"Okay, the wrist."
Can you max that image?
Can I max that image...
"What can you tell from a tattoo, or whatever that is?"
You're looking at a guy that solved a triple murder in Cole Valley off a bent coke spoon.
Can you make that any clearer?
Not with the tools at hand.
"All right, send me a screen cap."
I'll send it to Jenny.
She'll work on it.
Go back to where he stole the bike...
Hollis and 38th.
He had to have put on the helmet somewhere.
"All right, so, here he is at 60th... 57th..."
That's weird.
Okay.
It's okay.
I'll get him at 48th.
Is the camera broken?
"No, they're different cameras."
Go back to 60th.
What?
Somebody's erasing this... right now.
Leave Franz alone!
"You're in love with him, aren't you?"
"You don't wanna work for me, huh?"
- No!
- Say that again!
Let me go!
"You two, come here!"
"You're my friend, you saved my life."
"Here, take my crown."
"Franz, my dear Franz."
"Hmm, what's up?"
I just don't get this.
"Franz, don't you think we should move somewhere else?"
- Why?
"- I got money, I'll borrow you some."
Why?
I like it here.
You sent that guy away and tonight we're stuck.
We have a replacement.
First-class.
Who?
- He's a decent man.
- You'll see how I'll change his mind.
"I wanna move, to some suburb."
Come in!
"Cilly, a man is waiting outside for you."
Just seeing a tax return paper makes me go crazy.
I just don't know.
"Reinhold lets you know that they need someone tonight, you know the deal."
They want Franz to come over.
Reinhold sent this paper.
He wants you to come over.
"Jenny, can't talk now."
I'm in trouble with your dad and it is a lot worse than all of the other times.
I'm going to have to be off the grid for a little while.
"Nick, Nick, I've got some big news!"
"He's not done something stupid, has he?"
"Oh, god!"
I'll never be able to forgive myself.
"Nick, Nick, I'm having a baby!"
Nick?
"Jenny, that's brilliant!"
I'm so pleased for you!
"It is mine, yeah?"
"Yeah, of course."
Icing on the cake.
That is fantastic.
I'm going to come straight home.
I'll be with you as soon as I can.
Where are you?
"Where are we, lad?"
Half an hour now.
We'll be getting into *** in about two hours.
"I'll buddy up with a trucker, or something."
I'm going to be with you ASAP.
Synced by slake
Previously on Grimm...
No!
What have you done?
I don't have any powers.
You've taken everything.
Farley Kolt.
- Put the coins on the bed.
Why don't you drive it?
"Well, it doesn't run."
"I mean, at least not that I could figure out."
Why would you keep a car that doesn't run?
- Be more of a girl right now.
- Ha-ha-ha.
Why don't you come take a look at this?
"Elena, remember the old Camaro your dad used to have?"
Of course.
- I built and rebuilt that engine 20 times.
- Wow.
"Well, I don't like sports cars."
They're too hard to make out in.
"No, it wasn't that bad."
"- I'm sorry, man."
"- No, no."
Don't worry about it.
"You and Elena, you guys have a history and ignoring it doesn't do anybody any good."
She's good with you.
"You know, I wasn't sure, but she's happy and I'm glad."
"All right, let's take a look at this."
Ouch.
Damn it.
- Need some help?
- Damn it.
Stupid shoe.
Ugh.
Pick up your other foot.
Ahem.
There you go.
Thanks.
I think.
-She kissed me.
-That makes me feel so much better!
-lt didn't mean anything!
-The hug or the kiss?
-Neither.
-lt meant your arms around her body.
-lt meant her tongue in your throat.
"-Well, it was her tongue- l don't wanna hear this!"
-Sorry.
Stop.
-Let go of me.
-Just listen to me.
Why should I?
You lied to me.
-l didn't think it would happen again.
-You were wrong.
-l didn't want to embarrass her.
"-What are you talking about, Pacey?"
This your boss hitting on you.
"If you wanted to stop it, you could have."
And you didn't because you like it.
You are attracted to her and-- lt's really obvious to me.
"If you didn't want her to hit on you, why didn't you quit?"
Because maybe I need this job.
I'm not exactly rolling in money here.
I can't afford a place to live.
I'm not a rich college girl who can quit when the mood strikes me.
That's cool.
You know what?
"Screw the girl, keep your job."
Have your cake and eat it too. lt's fine!
You're still here.
So you come along for her friend.
See?
I knew it.
I knew it.
What the fuck is wrong with that?
When is it?
Tomorrow night.
I'm meeting Tuddy.
You could meet Tuddy.
Come early and then go.
Why do you always do this?
Don't give me that shit.
What did I ask you for?
A favor.
I do a lot of fucking favors for you.
I'm trying to bang this broad.
Help me out.
I don't understand you.
She's beautiful!
Her family lives in the Five Towns.
These Jews got money.
Maybe the family owns the whole block.
You may wind up with a big score.
You with your fucking mouth!
I had a meeting with Tuddy at 11:00 and here I am a backup guy for Tommy.
Did you have enough to eat?
It was delicious.
I'm just watching my diet.
Let me watch your figure.
I couldn't wait to go.
I was ordering dessert when they were eating dinner.
I was asking for the check.
What time is it?
It's almost fucking 10 o'clock.
How's it going?
"Well, we haven't got a shot off yet."
This is exciting.
The script is exciting.
I loved it.
"-Oh, I'm glad you liked it."
I loved it.
I thought it was so funny.
It's so funny.
So you liked the script?
"You think it's as good as ""Shakespeare in Love""?"
"Oh, much better."
"When you're not busy, could me and him talk to you?"
Sure.
Because he has something pretty big going on.
"-Oh, yeah?"
-Yeah.
Pretty big?
"Well, I ought to hear about it right now."
He wants to make a movie?
Yeah?
He's making a book right now.
Uh-huh.
And he has his own characters and everything.
And he wanted to know if he could make a movie out of it.
Why not?
"Just keep-- you have to have, like, a script or something."
You got to get some money.
You have to raise money.
You need money to make a movie.
- What's your name?
- Tia.
- I'm Rocky.
- I'm muscles.
- Crusher.
- And I'm dazzler.
We're the earthquake gang.
Does that scare you?
No.
Let's change our name again.
We gotta have a name that scares.
Yeah.
How'd you do what you done?
"Well, I really didn't do anything."
Yeah.
You a magician or something?
No.
You want to join our gang?
I'm sorry.
I'm looking for someone.
- Thanks anyway.
"- Aw, sure."
I guess you're like the rest of them.
You've heard we're a nothing gang.
"Yeah, well we ain't always gonna be nothing."
Someday we're gonna be the toughest.
Take over the whole territory.
Someday they're gonna run when they see us coming down the block.
All right.
It's just that I've got to find my brother.
What gang does he belong to?
He doesn't belong to any gang.
We've got to get it back.
Get it back?
It's absolutely a matter of life and death.
"Well, how do I pull the check out of the bank?"
"You know the manager of the bank, don't you?"
Yes.
Tell him you want it back.
"But that's highly irregular, I..."
"Look, get me that check back and I'll give you $5.000."
"Well, I'll try."
"I don't guarantee anything, but I'll try."
I'll be waiting for you in the coffee shop.
"Something else, sir?"
"Another cup of coffee, please."
You've had six.
"Well, make it seven."
"Yes, sir."
Hello?
This is Mr. Sabourin.
Has Mr. O'Hara come back yet?
"No, sir, he hasn't."
"By the way, Mr. Sabourin, Wentworth Drug is up two more points."
Isn't that nice?
"Yes, yes, thank you."
Well?
Let's talk about me.
What do I get?
What do you mean?
$5.000.
"Oh, no."
"No, Mr. Sabourin."
That check was stubbed.
Really?
I don't know.
I think the truth kind of gets you in trouble.
You know what you should do?
Find your dad one of those nice women that we saw in town.
Nice women don't understand him.
I don't even understand him.
"He spends all of his time wading around in mud, cataloging plants."
Good night.
Use the can if you need anything.
Can?
Looks like a boob.
"Hello, V?"
V.
"V, this is Frank."
From the can.
This is V.
My dad thinks you look like Grace Kelly.
Good night.
"Good night, Frank."
"I'm telling you, she slept in the tree house last night."
You're so full of shit.
"Oh, my God-- a ""C."""
My dad is going to kill me.
"What's wrong with a ""C""?"
Her car broke down in front of my house.
She had to stay.
She's there right now.
"She's going to tell on us, I know."
She's not there.
I bet you a zillion billion dollars that you are full of shit.
You're on.
"- You'll be my slave, then."
- Are you a Traoré?
"If I had known,"
I'd have carried the two sacks on my head.
"Traoré, do you have a new slave?"
Rather he has a new master.
All right.
I'll pay you tomorrow in front of the factory.
Ok.
See you!
"Don't go yet, little slave!"
Come with me to the Bozola Co-op.
The sale is over.
Impossible!
We need rice!
There's no more left...
No more for sale.
That's the last sack.
We're out of stock.
We're out of rice.
"Balla, let's go back!"
Come!
Boss!
"Don't call me boss, call me Balla Traoré."
I wanted a leave permit.
Did you get someone to replace you?
Then tell your boss that I sent you.
"Traoré, the boss is looking for you."
I'm going to get my rice.
That's your problem.
Get to work.
You screwed up with that part.
"I don't know about you, but I'm starved."
"I'm so hungry, I could eat a horse."
"This place, it's probably on the menu."
[woman laughs]
Come on.
"Hey, what's the joke here?"
Are you hungry enough to eat a horse?
"Uh, you bet."
"This place, it's probably on the menu."
"Well, we'll work on it."
"I'll tell you, Billy, the red chili's the best thing they have here."
When you eat it you feel like you're out on the range eating' off a chuck wagon.
"I want a hamburger, fries, and a Coke."
"Howdy, folks."
Hi.
- Having a good trip?
- Yep.
"I'm Hal, I'll be your waiter."
Yeah.
"And, uh, have you decided what you'd like?"
"Uh, not quite."
"Well, take your time."
We got nothing but time in the off-season.
Billy?
"Billy, bet I know what you'd like."
[coughs]
"You'd like a burger, French fries, and a Coke."
Yeah.
[whispers] Yeah.
That's right.
- And I guess we'll have the chili?
- Yep.
I came all the way here to make a deal.
Jumong?
I might be in hiding but I still know what's going on.
Jumong can't leave Jolbon because of the blockade.
Why would he come here?
We have our reasons.
Daesan.
Yes?
Bring me a big jar of wine.
"Yes, sir."
Let's see if you are who you claim to be.
Drink this.
Drink up!
Tie him to that tree.
"Yes, sir."
I heard Jumong is a master archer.
Shoot that target next to him.
Don't just stand there.
Hurry up!
I don't like playing games.
"If you don't believe me, just kill me instead."
"If you're going to die anyway, shouldn't you die trying?"
I'll let you live if you hit the target.
Commander!
Shoot.
You must be Okjuh soldiers.
Kill them!
Why won't you believe us?
This is Commander Jumong!
- He is!
- Shut up!
It's the army!
Where are the shovels?
It's Karen Hill. I want to talk to you.
Hello?
Don't hang up on me!
I want to talk to you!
"You keep away from my husband, you hear me?"
Open the door!
Answer me!
"I'm gonna tell everyone who walks in this building that in 2R, Rossi, you are nothing but a whore!"
Is this the superintendent?
"Yes, I want you to know sir, that you have a whore living in 2R!"
"Rossi, Janice Rossi."
Do you hear me?
He's my husband!
Get your own goddamn man!
"Wake up, Henry."
What are you doing?
"Karen, what are you, crazy?"
"Yeah, I""m crazy."
And I'm crazy enough to kill the both of you.
"Karen, take it easy."
Do you love her?
Do you?
I love you.
You know I love you.
You don't.
"No, you don't."
"Be careful, baby."
Don't.
How could I hurt him?
I couldn't even bring myself to leave him.
The truth was that no matter how bad I felt I was still very attracted to him.
- That's it!
That was one close finish.
You sure made Dinoco proud.
"Thank you, King."
"Well, Tex, you've been good to me all these years."
It's the least I could do.
"Whatever happens, you're a winner to me, you old daddy rabbit."
"Thanks, dear."
Wouldn't be nothing without you.
Kch-i-ka-chow!
- I'm Mia.
- I'm Tia.
"We're, like, your biggest fans!"
Ka-chow!
I love being me.
"- OK, girls, that's it."
"- We love you, Lightning!"
"Hey, buddy."
You're one gutsy racer.
"Oh, hey, Mr. The King."
You got more talent in one lug nut than a lot of cars has got in their whole body.
- Really?
"Oh, that..."
- But you're stupid.
- Excuse me?
"- This ain't a one-man deal, kid."
You need to wise up and get a good crew chief and a good team.
"You ain't gonna win unless you got good folks behind you, and you let them do their job, like they should."
- Like I tell the boys at the shop...
- A good team.
Yeah...
Ka-chow!
Now I understand why that ACP let me go.
So that the Boss can kill you?
So what are you waiting for?
Come on kill me.
Not even your father...
Don't speak about my father!
Because I can endure anything.
But I can never endure anyone abusing my father.
'I can endure anything.'
'But if anyone abuses my father.'
'I cannot endure that.'
Brother!
I'm your brother.
I want to hug you bro.
But... the rascal on the left keeping an eye on us.
Look.
Dad.
The Boss has Shiv in his grip.
Yes.
He's too good.
Now play along with me.
But I can't act.
That's the problem with you new-comers.
That's why I've come prepared.
Look.
Take a good look.
Look.
- This is the lion's paw.
- Yes.
If that's a paw... then I have a strong hand.
And when I pound someone with this... he never gets up again.
Strong arm!
- I'm concerned about this one child...
- Shut up!
"Respectfully, all right?"
"Respectfully, shut up."
Because we've got organs.
"I whish we could get organs delivered, instead of having to pick them up, you know?"
I hate flying.
"I always feel much closer to death on a plane than in the OR, don't you?"
I do now.
I met Izzie the other day.
She's very pretty.
So you--you think she's the one?
I-I don't know.
"Well, I mean, we're at that age, right?"
"Marriage, babies..."
That the plan?
I don't know!
I'm sorry.
"I-I don't make plans, okay?"
"If there's a future there, great."
"If not, whatever."
I'll get over it.
I always do.
Okay?
Okay.
I think it's nice.
Your date.
I think you and the pig murderer make a really good couple.
Okay.
What are you gonna do on your date?
What are you ganna talk about?
- Why do you care?
- He can find himself another hit man.
- I'm sure.
- I'll tell if you tell me.
- No!
"OK, kids, lunch is ready!"
You should get yourself a new map.
No.
This is my only school prize.
- The names are out of date.
- I know.
The old maps are the best.
The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics - that's a brilliant name for a country.
Are you gonna talk to me?
What do you want to know?
How did you get out so early?
Where are you living?
What are you gonna do with your life?
I'm out on licence.
I'm living in a kind of halfway house.
My life
"- I don't know, Jess."
I need some more time on that one.
- Is that it?
- Course it's not it.
- I did it for you.
- No.
I killed them for you.
- You did it for yourself.
"- Why did you write to me, then, Jess?"
Because I love you and you were the only person I could turn to.
"You're all I've got right now, Jess."
Promise me you won't go away again?
"Give us back our jobs, you arsehole."
Not now you all hate me.
The workers united will never be defeated!
..cheaper grain.
When do we want it?
Now!
What do we want?
Cheaper grain!
When do we want it?
Now!
Delphine?
What are you doing here?
"What are you doing here, Marcus?"
You said you'd cut grain prices and then you raised them!
I had to!
"Can you not protest against me, please?"
Why would you do that?
"Because he's looking after himself and his cronies, love."
"Mate, I'm trying to have a conversation with my girlfriend."
You go out with this arsehole?
"I do, yes."
And stop calling me that!
You could do a lot better!
Thank you.
"Shut up, please."
I'd dump him.
Dump him!
Dump him!
Dump him!
Dump him!
Dump him!
"I mean, this is not how I thought today would go."
Let's go.
"No, no."
We can't do that.
"What, you got a better idea?"
"Come on, dad, our window's closing, and we need to dine and dash now."
"Excuse me, sir."
Sir!
Wow.
I can't believe you did that.
"Yeah, neither can I."
That is so not you.
Can I ask you something?
Sure.
"So, where are you and Martin going?"
Dad.
What?
"Come on, I don't wanna talk about that."
"We're just gonna fight, ok?"
"Forget it, then."
It's ok.
"Well, I should get back."
"Oh, Martin said that you had 'till 5:00, right?"
"Sarah, I really just... just wanna tag along with you, see how you spend your time."
I'm not gonna interfere.
"I'll just sit there, won't say a word."
What is it you think I do?
Steal cars?
Vandalize private property?
Beg?
"Sarah, I have no idea what you do... and that's why I'm asking."
This is a life drawing class.
"Yeah, sorry to disappoint."
- You sure?
- Yeah.
No.
It's a laminate.
- That's not real hardwood floor?
- Nope.
It looks exactly like it.
But it is like one one-hundredth of the cost.
Oh.
I still wanna go with the real wood.
What?
You can't even tell the difference.
It's not the point.
"Well, what is the point?"
I just...
I don't like the way it's pretending to be wood.
"If you're not wood, don't try and look like wood."
I don't think that it's pretending.
"This is a lie, Ben."
Just be up front and tell people what you really are.
"Okay, you're right."
You're right.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Maybe we should just go look at the grills and we'll come back.
Okay.
I slept with someone.
- I said...
- I heard you.
You tell me this in Home Depot because you know I hate a public scene.
"No, that is not why I'm telling..."
I knew it.
"My love, you got me spinning like a wind-up toy"
"# Hot kiss, won't you tell me what you miss, boy?"
"# My love, you got me spinning like a wind-up toy"
"# You can't knock it, or rock it, or be-bop it"
# It's an itch you can't scratch Nothing's gonna stop it...
Oh... you're up.
I thought I'd bring you a cup of tea.
"Er... come and sit down, Tom."
There's... something I'd better tell you.
"I'm going to divorce you, Tommy 'cause I want to get married again."
He's...
He's a good man.
He lives in the next village.
He's a plumber.
"Oh, come on."
You didn't think I wanted to grow old on my own.
"Well, speak to me, then."
I'll bring this in to Frances.
She'll probably be glad of a cuppa.
"- Frances, can I come in?"
- No.
Go away.
"Oh, please."
"Hear me out, Frankie, will you?"
I brought a nice cup of...
- Did you listen?
I said no.
- Please.
I just want to talk.
Huh?
Here...
I don't know where to start.
Mommy just has to have some tests done.
That's all.
There are more schnitzels in the fridge.
I'll make some.
Leave her be.
Have a seat.
I'd rather stand.
Would you like something to drink?
- No.
How's your father?
He's in the hospital.
- What's wrong?
Do you really care?
Yes.
I saw a picture of the musical in the hallway.
You and Dad are embraced.
How idyllic.
"That's all over, Goni."
All the big hits in this theater were his.
His name is on half of the posters in the hallway.
No one can take away the credit for the things he did.
"Yes, but no one's giving him any work either."
Including you.
How old are you?
25.
Why?
Did you know that my son is 21?
"I came to talk about Dad, not your son."
Do you know how long he's out of work?
I know.
You used to be friends.
There are things you don't know.
That's why I wanted to retire.
Sorry.
"No, I'm sorry."
"I'm so sorry, Blair."
"Look, I shouldn't a..."
I shouldn't have pushed us to do all those jobs.
I shouldn't have gone back into that fucking house.
I should have put you first.
Hello friends!
Are we having fun yet?
"Listen, this is what's gonna happen, all right."
"They're gonna come in, I'm gonna lure them away, you find a safe place to hide until somebody gets here."
I'm not leaving you.
"No, they're gonna come for the sheriff, so you gotta stay alive until then."
We have to stay together.
Please.
Please.
"You have to swear to me that you'll run and hide, okay?"
Swear to me.
"It's the only way, Blair."
"Blair, come on, you know it's the only way."
Okay.
Okay.
"I love you, okay."
Get ready to run and hide.
Oh Jesus!
Get back.
"Oh my God, Connor."
Ow.
Sorry.
"Come on, hurry."
"Go downstairs, go downstairs."
Put me down!
Put me down!
I can't go!
I've got to stay!
Put me down!
Stop!
Stop this sled!
Whoa!
What's the matter?
- You untie these straps.
"- Oh, no, no."
You might fall off.
I'm doing this for your own good.
Later on you'll thank me.
"I hate you, you beast!"
Let me out of here!
"Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me!"
Whoops!
Ha!
- Let's go!
Mush!
- Mush.!
Beans.
"It's customary up here, Mrs. Blake, for everybody to pitch in and do their share."
"You've been with us two days, and you haven't done anything but sit around and look nasty."
Can you cook?
"Yes, I'm considered a very excellent cook."
Huh.
"Well, how about giving these beans the benefit of your talents?"
I'll do nothing to help you.
"I'm your prisoner, and since you seem to want me with you, you'll take care of me."
Want you?
- There's that one.
- Is that a pentagram on the wall?
"Hmm, it kind of depends what you mean by pentagram."
I think he means this five-sided witchy-shaped thing here.
"Oh yeah, it is a pentagram."
I think we'll take a pass.
OK.
This building's on fire!
I'm 25% sure that fire has been put out.
Next.
[ sigh ] Oh!
"Well, what about this one?"
This one looks kind of perfect.
Yeah!
It does.
Can we see it?
Can we see it now?
Well...
I'll just get...
another one.
- Please.
"- Eat, eat."
Maybe we should wait outside.
"What if the police come by, and"
- I'm not there to be arrested?
"- Face it, Babs,"
They're not coming.
"Now, let's go play some lawn darts!"
But this is so unfair!
Why won't the police arrest me?
They're just not that onto you.
"- What's worse, I spent all that money on that bomb-making stuff."
Would you rather I'd lied?
Maybe.
"Well, I'm sorry."
I didn't think you'd want to sleep in the same bed...
"Oh, believe me... we are not sleeping in this bed."
Yaah!
Ugh!
So where are we gonna sleep?
Don't know.
Maybe I should just go home.
No.
You are home.
And we're not spending our first night back together apart.
"Look, I'm hating this as much as you are..."
Uh-huh.
...but we've got to move forward.
What's done is done.
You slept with morning.
I slept with rob.
And Matt.
We're still counting that?
"Oh, it counts."
You were with two people.
I was only with one.
"True, but I slept with two people only once."
"You were with one person twice, so, in effect..."
apples to apples...
I think we're even.
And I think your maths only works if you're fucking the apples.
"Look, I'm just trying to help us get through this."
How?
How can I get through this?
Shut up!
Help!
...
Saw your bro's name card and I saw a deal.
The person who killed your bro has a tattoo.
It's a scorpion.
Take it.
Thought you've principles?
Why pay me?
For your medical bills.
Thanks Mr. Lin.
I'd waited for you whole night.
Our fight is not over.
You still want to fight?
I'm not in the mood.
Then I win.
Since I defeated you
I'll help with your bro's case.
I'm the best cop around.
Even when suspended?
"Suspended, not resigned."
I've the highest record for cases solved.
Widest network of informers.
I know.
Using money.
Can you not shoot me down?
I'll find the killer very soon.
How soon?
I give you 3 weeks.
I don't need 3 weeks.
"Once done, you go back home quickly."
To your place of origin.
"–Oh, sure I can."
"The truth is, the people we save from the worst day of their lives... never gotta see us when we have to face ours."
"Hell, and why should they?"
"We took the job, not them."
"–No, that's not right."
"–What you gonna do, man?"
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
–Fleetwood's got a warehouse full of stolen merch.
–No.
I say we nail him.
Sell half the stash to my new C.I.
–We get you some new digs.
"–I can't let you do that, all right?"
"Hey, I'm just..."
I'm just trying to do some good.
"You know, and deliver some karmic justice."
"Now are you in, or are you out?"
Easy.
Don't suck on his tailpipe.
One second.
–Yeah.
–It's me.
–Where are you?
–Home.
"–What, our home?"
–Yeah.
The keys still work.
–Are the kids with you?
–Yeah.
We're all here.
"Oh, thank you."
–This doesn't change things.
- Clark.
"Uh, yeah, I know, I know."
This...
This is my home.
It is!
Rough day?
Y-yeah.
Were you -- were you saving this?
"No, no."
It's fine.
"But you don't usually drink, Clark."
What's wrong?
"Martha, you know how much I love you, don't you?"
Of course.
But with this job...
I can't always be as...
honest as I would like.
"Well, I know that."
"Thing is, you don't know."
"You don't know, so stop saying that you know."
Okay.
"It's okay that you have moods, Clark."
I'm not afraid of the different sides of you.
I love all of you.
"The world is an ugly place, Martha."
"And it is full of brutish, cruel, nasty people."
I heard something on the recording from Gaad's office.
Is he in more trouble?
He's probably gonna lose his pension -- maybe even go to jail.
- You shouldn't feel sorry for him.
"- Well, how can I not?"
- Martha.
Off to meet girls.
I've got a 30-foot range.
"- (girl) Is that you, Shawn?"
- Get out.
Fine.
No girls for me.
"I'll just study and get good grades and get smart and become a famous scientist, and then I'll build a wife."
I'm bored.
- (♪ jazz)
- What's that?
Mom?
Dad?
Are you home?
"- Cory, we're studying."
- So am I.
"Don't go, Rebecca."
Sorry.
I really don't feel like being here anymore.
You haven't seen the whole house.
Let me take you up to the roof.
"Actually, Eric, I think it's nice we didn't go any further than we did."
- Thank you.
- No prob.
Why don't we just study together like we planned?
- I need to study alone.
- So I'll see you Friday?
No.
"OK, then!"
"So, what's new?"
- I'm gonna kill you.
- I have you.
"I'm gonna kill you, I'm gonna bring you back to life, and I'm gonna kill you again."
But I'm so close.
Okay.
Do I need the thing to get out?
"Oh, great, you're here."
Let's go down.
Look at this.
"Wow, that's amazing."
Were you able to talk to Patrick about the maintenance?
"Yeah, we spoke this morning."
"Well, it really is amazing."
It just looks so real.
Like this wrapper.
It looks like a real hamburger wrapper.
"- Oh, that wrapper is real."
- What?
Yeah.
I always throw in a few real things.
Kind of cast a glow over the plaster objects.
"You know, kind of bump it all up a notch."
Did you do this at the MoMA show?
"Were there real things in that show, or-"
"Oh, yeah."
Course.
This is mine.
You got it from the staff kitchen.
"No, I made that."
This stuff is really good for your skin.
It has like all these minerals in it.
- Let me see!
- Let mejust finish!
- It doesn't match at all.
- It will.
There should be a cross passage about three yards from there.
"Tac Team leader, bring that *** down by agent Mei."
Guys...
It's Sara's.
We got a heat source.
"Wherever the reading's coming from, it's not on the blueprints."
Let's go.
"All right, we got something."
It's about five meters down the access shaft.
Hold your 20.
Lin's team will be on the flip side of the shaft in three minutes.
This is Alpha to Staging Command.
Can't read you.
We're going in.
There's our heat source.
That looks like a piece of her dress.
She was here.
Check it out.
Cover!
"Alpha, this is Staging Command."
Do you read me?
Do you read me?
!
"Kelton, answer me, damn it!"
Monroe!
Where's Kelton?
I couldn't get to him.
There was too much debris.
We can't get through.
Roof collapse.
"I repeat, we cannot get through."
"All right, call in Search and Rescue now."
His traces only exist in the past.
Like a ghost hunt.
Ghosts have a soul.
He does not.
"From a technical point of view, A mind is a soul."
"This is not funny, Bishop."
I've seen them kill.
Suicide would be the best option.
"If you're afraid,..."
I get it.
Just put me in the right direction and I go alone.
We must find Cage.
That's not my style.
Not like a hiding place.
Cage is a man!
An old and nasty fighter.
With many weapons.
"He lives four days walking, Inside the death zone."
No human is so crazy.
"I did not say, that is not crazy."
Come.
I know the way
"Hello, guests."
My name is Sara.
"Sorry, my husband is not there."
Will come back later
We wait.
"Cookies, that's milk."
"I can see that, Sara."
Where do you get them?
"I made them, of course."
They try my husband better than his mother's cookies.
"Everything is fine, Franz."
The bar clown next door wants you to sing for him  for his ridiculous event.
Toni wants me to sing?
You can sing?
Can she sing?
I just want to let you know that I've cancelled it.
But why?
I could just sing for him once.
I would gladly do it.
I don't want her to sing for Toni.
Toni is a slave driver.
"You said it yourself, Franz."
They work all night long.
She's not working for Toni.
"If you have to, you can sing for him once."
Sing him the Internationale.
He'd enjoy that.
What?
The international workers anthem!
There were workers here once.
Screw it.
"I'm sorry, Franz."
I'm singing.
I'm singing!
I don't want to go to Toni's.
I won't go in there.
I've never been in there and I never will.
Once again....
You've sold the doors and the door frames?
Why?
I mean what could you get for a door plus the frame.
"Excuse me, but I have no idea."
Okay.
Where you going?
Away.
With a man I met from est.
"What do you mean, ""away""?"
Away.
I don't know.
For a few days.
"We've, um..."
[Sighs]
Had this emotional connection for some time... and we just want to see if there is something else there.
You're telling me you're going to have an affair?
- Sandra?
- I might.
I don't know.
At least I'm being honest.
Go ahead.
Tell me that you're not having an affair.
I'm...
You know what kills me about the whole thing?
Is that you didn't have any idea anything was going on.
"You, Mr. Counterintelligence Genius."
You just didn't see it?
So you either didn't want to know or... you didn't care enough to pay attention.
Who is he?
- It doesn't matter.
- Who is he?
It doesn't matter who he is.
What are you gonna do?
Go arrest him?
[Laughs]
Sandra.
Mrs Andrews?
Hi.
Probably don't remember me.
I live next door to Bob.
My name's Gil Raymond.
"Just thought I'd pop by, see how you were."
Gil?
"Oh, Gil."
You picked up my spoon.
Excuse me?
In the garden.
You picked up my spoon.
Erm....
"Oh, so I did."
"Oh, God, listen, what a day that was."
She never wanted me there in that house in the first place.
"Oh, I'm sure that's not true."
You don't know her.
She's a nasty piece of work.
The way she used to treat me sometimes.
And the things she used to say.
And he was no better.
Wouldn't lift a finger for me unless he had to.
And then....
Then he started mucking about with prostitutes.
"He was a pervert and... she was a mean, spiteful bitch."
And I tell you now... they deserved each other.
"Oh, well, my gosh."
How about I pour you another cup of tea because....
What do you think?
This one looks like it's getting a bit...cold.
Darling.
We'll check the lists.
Come here.
What are you waiting for?
I have to check your behind.
Turn over!
I don't think I can.
Wiggle a bit.
"Where are you from, son?"
Urfa.
"Wow, Urfa."
Not a traitor but a taker.
What do you do for living?
"I am a Zenne, sir."
Would a real man shake his hips for living?
"I always wanted to dance, sir."
"Good, then."
We can always use a go-go dancer.
"I am gay, sir."
"We can't hear you here, speak up!"
I am homosexual.
How can we be sure of that?
I brought you pictures.
"Here, take these."
What's this look?
What does your dad have to say about this faggotry?
"Sir, my father was a commander like you."
He died in combat in south-eastern Turkey.
"Not sure, what he'd say now..."
Give me the envelope.
So?
"Sorry, wrong envelope."
We'll show you how it works.
* What I know of it has me up a tree *
* Love is crazy
* After full of it what's come over me *
* We both said goodbye and parted *
* We agreed that it was there *
* Now I've got to make up all of it *
* Why haven't I confessed?
* I'm in love
* All over [banging on the drum]
* Tell me what did you do You're better than you * [whispering] What do you mean by bringing those people here?
Take off that uniform and get out.
You're fired!
You're fired.
He beat you to it.
Shh.
Get those people out of here.
[mark tree jingling]
"Oh, I beg your pardon, sir."
Young man..
I'm looking for the Patio Bar.
- Good idea.
"- Yes, indeed."
"- Hi, Doug."
- Hi.
"Let me see, just-just where are we now?"
"Hello, pop."
I thought you were going to Patio Bar.
"Well, bless me, so did I."
- What place is this?
"- Well, sir.."
You're now in the locker rooms of one of the largest enterprises in the world.
Complete with...
It's just that I've got to find my brother.
What gang does he belong to?
- He doesn't belong to any gang.
- [boys snicker]
I never heard of a Guy that never belonged to a gang.
I'm sure something's happened.
I've got to find him.
"If anybody could find him, we could."
"I mean, we know this town inside out."
"Oh, would you?"
"Hey, yeah, sure."
"Listen, you done us a big favor, now we'll do it for you."
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
"Hey, come on, let's go."
That Tony sure made himself scarce.
- We better walk you home.
- Where do you live?
I...
I was supposed to stay at a hotel.
But I don't know which one.
You could stay in our hideout.
- [boys] yeah!
- Thank you.
We'll look for Tony tomorrow.
If we aren't busy beating up goons.
- Yeah.
"- Hey, it's yo-yo."
- Get down.
"- Come on, hide."
- Did he see us?
- I don't know.
JESSIE:
"Oh, God!"
You kids do watch too many movies.
Come on in!
I don't have my suit on.
"So, Mick, do you like girls better than frogs yet?"
I don't like frogs.
Nice evasive move.
- What?
- Nothing!
"Mikey, you're staring at me."
"No, I'm not."
"Hey, it's okay to look."
"It may not be polite to stare, but looking's nothing be embarrassed at."
Just promise me one thing.
"When the girls you look at, they start to look back, make sure you're real nice to them; okay?"
"If I had a girlfriend, I'd do anything for her."
I bet you would.
MAN:
"Oh, my God!"
What the heck are you watching?
Just a horror film.
"Sorry, Buddy."
I don't feel good about you watching that kind of stuff.
"Besides, it's bedtime."
So what kind of fun stuff did you do today?
- Dad?
- Yeah.
How do you know you love a girl?
I don't know.
You just know.
It makes you feel good all over.
We're doing this my way.
"Ah, yeah, 'cause it's your way or the highway."
"Oh, God."
Not the highway.
You always want me to be his dad.
"Well, I'm being his dad."
"Oh, uh, I-I'm really scared, Jay."
This is what we're fixing.
"Look, when I was a kid,"
"I lived by a big, scary black lake."
I always thought there monsters in there and whatnot.
"One night, my dad dragged me out of bed and tossed me right in that cold water."
I was never scared of that lake again.
"Now, give it some gas."
- Mama!
- Aah!
"That's another habit I wouldn't mind breaking, but, you know, right now we... have to..."
"Oh, what am I doing?"
I hated my dad for that.
"I ended up scared of him, not the lake."
"Manny, it's okay."
Over there!
On the bike!
The white guy that stole my phone!
I don't see anyone.
Yes!
He just turned the corner!
The phone burglar!
He's getting away!
Not this time.
Up there to the left!
I don't see anyone!
So you and Finn don't have to keep living in sin.
Whatever.
"- You hear that, Finn?"
- What?
You're off the hook.
"Oh, he's just daydreaming about two paintings a day instead of one."
"Well, I don't know."
Just give a guy a second here.
I need to think.
"(WHIRRING, CLICKING)"
"Ah, I never get tired of that sound."
"(BULB POPS, WHIRRS)"
Finn.
"All right, come on, guys."
It's not like I want to do this.
"Okay, then let's not do it!"
"Uh, do I need to remind you about the roasted dead guy in our basement?"
"We got to do what's in the photo, right, bro?"
How the hell did this happen?
I don't know.
Maybe it's a fucking dare.
- Maybe we're drunk.
- Maybe it was an accident.
It's a fucking lip lock.
We didn't just bump into each other.
"Say something, Finn."
We should destroy that machine.
What?
We can't do that.
I know.
It's too late.
It doesn't matter why we do this.
"""Redress,"" that's the sort of word."
And a lot of other words.
- Men have been here for years.
- Why don't they leave?
Leave?
Get caught and flogged like him?
- I won't join a mutiny.
- It's not a mutiny.
- And you're gonna prove it.
- You're taking the oath.
What are they doing there?
- What's this gathering?
- Just making rope.
With these louts lying on it?
Move!
Let's move it!
Don't quit!
Get moving!
Watch out or next time you'll get it.
I'm sorry.
It's my fault.
- Yours?
"- I pulled on the rope, tripped him."
"Don't have any more accidents, Vizard."
Or I'll have a look at your backbone.
Boatswain?
What's the matter?
Are you crazy?
"Vizard, I will join."
Good lad.
You'll be flogged for this.
Sergeant!
I just had to.
"Now, I know all about everything."
"You know if you're found, you'll be in a terrible jam."
- I don't care.
"- Oh, sweet...."
- What are you doing away from the school?
- I'm out.
Thompson fired me.
- He what?
- That's nothing.
That's part of it.
You should know all he's done.
- Tell me.
- We had a terrible row over the food.
That's why he fired me.
The boys can't eat it.
It's worse now than ever.
They won't stand for anything more.
All they need is a spark and they're capable of anything.
"Defendant, you're charged with the murder of Johnny Stone."
He knew Johnny was sick and he put him in the cooler.
"And you knew it too, didn't you?"
"You dirty, squealing rat."
Yeah.
"And you, Thompson, you killed Skinny."
"No, no."
"No, I didn't, boys."
I didn't.
I didn't know he was so sick.
I never would have done it.
- I ain't gonna let you throw yourself--
- Mind your business.
"- So, what happens to her?"
- I was just gonna ask that.
- She probably dies.
"- Now, that's cool."
"- No, that's depressing."
"- Oh, I give up."
Excuse me.
- (quietly):
What's going on?
"- Christy, I can't do this."
You should just take her home with you.
No.
I already have a daughter I screwed up.
This one's yours.
But it's so awkward.
I have nothing in common with her.
So what?
"She needs a home, she doesn't need a buddy."
"I know, but I really want her to like me."
Then you shouldn't have signed up to be a mom.
"Hey, how about, how about you and Bonnie come live here and help me with her?"
We might have to take you up on that.
Let's see how the banana bread goes.
"Oh, great."
Now I don't know what you're talking about.
"Christy, this was a mistake."
"When people don't like me at first, they never like me."
I don't have a chance with her.
That's not true.
I didn't like you at first.
You didn't?
Nope.
Which one?
The one with the red lid.
It's just soy sauce.
Bring it over.
"What, are you deaf?"
"Out of the way, come on."
Stand back.
What is that?
I'll be fucked...
It's a real wicked spirit we've got here.
"You don't want to leave, do you?"
Let's go!
Stop it!
Hyo-jin!
"Come here, you!"
You met up with something recently you weren't supposed to?
I don't follow you.
Did you disturb someone?
"Of all the evil I've seen, this is the strongest."
You disturbed it.
"Oh, God!"
What do we do now?
Who is it?
Who did you disturb?
Tell him.
A Japanese man...
I knew it.
That's no man.
That's a ghost.
All the things happening around here are his doing.
"If nothing is done, it's not just your daughter, but everything that walks on two feet will perish."
Sir!
"- Boys, boys."
"Boys, stop."
It's the truth.
I swear Patsy's telling you the truth.
"I'm willing to take my chances, see this thing through."
We're in the same boat.
I'm not leaving here until they come and take me.
"If there's quitting to be done, you're gonna do it."
Don't be chumps.
Don't let them pin anymore on you.
We've got a rap to beat.
The way to start beating it is by putting out that fire.
"Now, what do you say?"
Do we do it?
"Jim, Butch, Mac, do we do it?"
"Casey, what do you say?"
"- Okay, come on."
- Come on.
Come on--
"- So that's it, eh, Charlie?"
"- Yes, sir."
"All right, boys, you can go."
There's no doubt that this tragedy was Thompson's own fault.
"- You agree, coroner?"
- The sheriff and I both agree.
"Mr. Gargan, I owe you a sincere apology."
"Oh, forget it."
"Hey, wait a minute."
They can't do nothing to him.
The guy's gonna be okay.
"Besides, he pulled a gun on Patsy."
- Shut up.
Hey...
"I'll pay these guys back, I'll be back here"
"- in an hour, tops."
- Griffin...
"I'll come back here Sandy, we'll call Dad."
We will work this out as a family OK?
I promise you.
"Hey, it's Griff."
You know the drill.
"Hey, Griffin."
"It's me, your father."
I just want you to know that I love you.
And that we all make mistakes.
"You're responsible for your actions, I'm not saying you're not, but"
I want you to know that you're not alone; you have me and your sisters and even your mom.
I got you your job back.
I know it's not...
"It's not the best, but you know, maybe you're doing some good there and we're there for you, and... um, you can..."
"So just call me OK, just call me please."
"Would you do that, please?"
"And you're not alone, Griffin."
You're not alone.
- Long night?
- Yup.
- We should sleep.
Talk later.
- No.
Talk now.
OK.
Jerry kissed me.
It was a Hail Mary and it failed.
Total fail.
The dress says you have.
Oh no!
Oppa!
Welcome.
"Oppa, she said I gained weight."
Did I gain weight?
Does it look like I did?
"I don't know, I can't really tell."
What do you think?
Right.
It's nice.
Shouldn't you be a bit more excited?
Why are you so uninterested?
"He's just like that, don't worry about it."
Here.
The groom's suit!
"Yes, please come this way."
"Don't make any adjustments, I'll lose it by exercising more."
"I'll exercise and starve myself, so don't make any adjustments, okay?"
"If you can't breathe, you'll faint during the ceremony."
"It'll be healed by the wedding, right?"
"Yes, it'll be fine."
Wait.
I can't stand it.
It's old-fashioned.
She's my daughter.
Oh my!
She's beautiful!
I guess.
Ma'am...
She looks like an angel.
How could you have come up with such a phrase?
It was supposed to prevent!
I was supposed to protect them!
I should have expected this!
It was supposed to prevent!
-Enough.
It was supposed to prevent!
It's okay.
You're supposed to stop it!
It's okay.
Okay.
"You're supposed to stop it, Bobby!"
Look at me.
You're a good man.
You're a good man.
"Come on, we have to stand up."
"If Ray came to the road, they will have to hitchhike."
We have to catch him before than catching a ride.
Listen to me.
"When you come to a fork road, turn left ."
This will take you back to the place where you took the family.
I doubt that headed for the highway.
I will go in that direction.
Take this.
I have one in my car.
Bobbi.
-What is it?
Are you in trouble about all this?
I do not know.
I do not give a fuck.
"I'm dying, do you remember?"
What the fuck!
Ti.
If you are planning to blow your brains out... ..could you wait till you're out on the high seas?
I just mopped these floors.
I don't need this shit.
you asked me to help you.
And God knows I've tried.
not really if you're not going to talk to me.
I hear you at night.
You're not sleeping.
You don't wanna talk about that.
Or the booze you're drinking.
Or the pus you're wiping away from your knuckles.
Or the blood I wash from your clothes.
Or the fresh wounds in your chest.
The ones that aren't healing.
And I'm pretty sure you don't wanna talk about the fact that you can't read the label on that bottle.
Ibuprofen.
That was my favorite mug.
Stay out of my shit.
Logan.
On the inside you're sick.
I can smell it.
{\i1\cH00ffff}Best night ever!
driver.
I love you.
I love you.
You're such a doll.
Mr. Logan.
Jesus.
Please.
We need a ride.
Not available.
Call a cab.
"Now, what's he going to do?"
What's he going to do?
And...
Wait.
Don't tell me.
"Sound engineer Billy Logan, right?"
"Oh, my God."
What are you doing here?
"Oh, my God."
"Come in, come in, come in, come in!"
"Oh, I can't believe this."
Here.
You've been taking pictures of me.
"Yeah, I thought I saw you."
I hope you don't mind.
"There was nothing on the website, so, I took a few candids."
They're for the next issue.
"Cast and crew, after hours, behind the scenes."
"While I have you here, I have a couple of questions."
It's not your lucky day.
What a shame.
Just a kid.
At least he didn't hit anybody when he jumped.
Are we sure he jumped?
"""Tired of losing."" Not much of a note."
"Brevity, the soul of wit."
But he was a writer.
Look at all these letters.
No.
There's something weird about this.
"Monk, look around you."
That note's probably the least weird thing in the whole apartment.
"I mean, why am I lying to my husband about whether or not I put gas in the car?"
It was stupid.
And we each thought the truth would destroy the other person.
Funny how that happens.
But we all want to have sex with someone new.
"It's risky, it's exciting, and that's okay."
But divorce over that?
I would never leave my husband for a better orgasm.
"Thank you, honey."
Do we have to do it in here?
"There's a private office downstairs, I think."
Mmm.
"Oh, God."
Hold that thought.
Hang on.
_
Is everything okay?
"Let me get you another drink, okay?"
There's no need to rush.
We're here to take our time.
You want me to wait?
You know what happens to those that wait.
Good things.
They come.
"Oh, God."
"Oh, excuse me."
"Neil, there you are."
What's wrong?
Adriana's done a very bad thing.
I don't know if I can fix it.
What the hell?
"- Oh, no."
And it's self conscious.
Conscious of self.
Right.
"I mean, yeah, yeah."
I'm self conscious.
"Which is a good thing, I think."
What do you think?
"Well, I mean, I think it's really good."
I'm all about my work.
And my body is my work.
"So... one might say that... yeah, I'm all about my body."
"But in some respects, that is true, but you're completely missing the point."
And the point is...
I completely missed my point.
"Ok, rewind, reset."
"Uh, look."
I've... got a great vibe between you and me.
Great energy there.
"So, yeah."
Ok.
I get it.
So let's lay the facts down.
"You want to be with me, and vice versa."
That much is clear.
But my work always comes first.
I need to lay that...
down right off the bat.
"Basically, my body comes before you."
He seems perfect.
"Good looking, somewhat single minded, somewhat vain... and not too bright."
No promise of a great romance.
No chance of falling...
I gotta go.
Now...
Where were we?
Myka did name the ferret.
She's just not telling Pete the name.
- Why not?
- Because she named it Pete.
"Yeah, it's cute, but so annoying."
- That's good.
I like that.
"- You think that's funny, huh?"
"Because if she thinks we know, she'll kill him."
Name's Pete.
"Look, you're in trouble and I'm here to help."
"That chip that you have, the one that's changed your luck..."
- Let go or I'll scream.
"- Jillian, it's hurting you."
"Okay, that is a contact wound."
Wishing objects do that.
"This one seems to be a bit addictive and we both know that that's bad, right?"
"So you keep the money, but you give me the chip."
"Gary's sick too, isn't he?"
"You gotta stop while you're ahead, Jillian."
Trust me.
Don't make me use this.
"The Jubilee Grand, right?"
The fire?
What are you gonna do with it?
I am gonna put this on a shelf and ignore it forever.
I know.
Now watch.
Watch what?
Say the rest.
I need to hear it.
I love francis more.
What's this?
Open it.
It's blank.
it's nothing.
She let me decide.
"It's odd, isn't it?"
That your mother was the one
To show me what was truly in my heart.
You.
It's you.
It's always been you.
Does this mean you'll marry me?
Yes.
We must protect sebastian.
There are those who will punish him
For reaching for the throne.
Of course.
I'll make sure of it.
I am sorry for the way things have gone.
But the outcome is this.
You need to leave here
And never come back.
"You've reached for the crown,"
And you failed to get it.
You'll be seen by many as a threat.
"The crown was never in my grasp,"
"But I had mary, and it galls you."
I was going to disappear in exile.
"That's your goal now, if you want to survive."
This is Park Chun-bae.
He owns this house.
"He killed his wife, too?"
It appears so.
What's that bastard's name?
Park Chun-bae.
Then what?
"What do you mean, what?"
Gotta get rid of it.
"Either banish it, or kill it."
I'm casting a deadly hex tomorrow at the hour of the dog.
"Yes, sir."
You got the money?
How much?
"About 10 grand, don't you think?"
I'll have it ready.
Good.
Listen.
What I'm doing tomorrow- it's no ordinary ritual.
I'll be casting a death hex.
It's incredibly dangerous.
So you can't do anything that would taint it.
No intercourse.
Watch what you eat and drink.
Or the spell will backfire.
"Yes, sir."
Okay then.
You can go.
Can I ask you something?
What?
That Japanese guy.
You said he's a ghost.
Kind of a bad guy.
But you got better.
And I...
I always loved you anyway.
I'm glad you came back into Johnny's life.
Mom.
Can you believe this asshole?
He's still asleep.
I heard you talking to him.
"Yeah, well, we're an emotional lot, the Irish."
Giving up on him?
"No, just making my peace with him."
You should too.
"I mean, maybe he's just waiting around for you to tell him it's all right for him to go."
And I'm not saying that just 'cause I had him going today in the pool.
Although that would be a nice parting gift!
I don't know what to say.
You'll think of something.
Thanks.
"Okay, Dad, um, we love you."
You've been a good dad.
You've been an...
You've been an okay dad.
"On a scale of one to ten,"
I'd say you were a six...
You were a five.
Um...
"But look, last year, you really made a comeback."
"I mean, you were..."
You were almost an eight.
But I get it.
You saved people's lives for a living.
But thank you very much.
Send your man up for the carriage as soon as you're ready.
Goodbye.
Don't thank us.
Your feet are cold.
What have you been doing?
You can grow potatoes in this dirt.
It's cold.
I'm cold.
Where can Brandon be?
I hope he's not lamed his horse.
Col. Brandon is the most eligible bachelor in the county.
He is bound to go for one of you.
He's a better age for Miss Dashwood.
But I dare say she's left her heart behind in Sussex.
"I see you, Miss Marianne!"
I think I've unearthed a secret.
You are worse than my best pointer.
Is he a butcher.
Baker.
Candlestick maker?
I'll winkle it out of you.
- She's good at winkling.
- We've none of us any secrets here.
Or if we do.
we do not keep them long.
- He's curate of the parish.
- Or perhaps a handsome lieutenant.
- Give us a clue.
Is he in uniform?
- He has no profession.
He's a gentleman?
- They're my roommates.
"- Cece, hi."
"I'm gonna go in and get the rest of your stuff, Jess."
"Wait, let's just talk about this, okay?"
"You know, rap it out."
We can't rap it out.
We're not together.
It's not the same.
- Doesn't mean we can't talk.
- Nothing to talk about.
Give me my shirt back.
"No, you gave this to me."
I wanna keep it.
"- Give her her T-shirt, man."
"- No, I don't want to."
And I gave her this hat.
I'm gonna take this back.
- This one?
You want that?
- Yeah.
"Then I dare you, come take it off my head, pal."
I dare you.
- You guys look ridiculous.
"- Look, give her the shirt back."
- I bet she worked hard on that jamboree.
"- Yeah, play on words."
- Jamboree.
Jam.
- Jam.
"Girl made a lot of jam, Spence."
You know how time-consuming that can be?
"You need ajar funnel, a canner, some fresh fruit strawberries, raspberries, maybe a tayberry, maybe a ripe..."
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
"Oh, this is the man who saved you."
He's the one.
I was in the right place at the right time.
I want to talk with yuko.
Come on.
Let me show you the place.
It's been a difficult week.
Yeah.
"Campanela, taka, thank you Shelly."
And now our connect at the Mexican boarder has been killed.
Do you know who did it?
I think maybe his wife killed him.
"No, shit."
These things happen.
I do know this guy in San Diego.
I do know this guy in San Diego.
"When I was in high school, I used to smuggle a little pot, you know."
Then I would cut him in on the action.
And he still works the boarder.
Sounds promising.
"And the best this is, he doesn't have a wife."
I like you Nick Davis.
I think fate brought you to me.
Well here's to fate.
And to family.
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
I've offended you?
"No, I was just thinking about something."
Tell me.
Did you know Miles did the frosting on that?
You see that?
It took me five minutes to figure out it was a Fibonacci series...
Where the next number is 21.
"Now you're slipping, Cam."
"Cam, you owe another six bucks."
"No, no."
I didn't eat any of the Buffalo wings.
"Oh, really?"
That's great.
"Well, we're not doing it that way."
We're just dividing equally.
So let's say you pay.
"- I got it, all right?"
"- No, no."
I got it.
I got it.
I got it.
I got it.
It's your birthday.
You're as broke-ass as I am.
I just wish now I had eaten some of those wings.
"So, I nailed the specs on the 2.09 last night, after 19 cups of coffee."
- Check it out.
- You are kidding.
- What is this?
- You're kidding!
This is good.
"Miles, this is good."
"Yeah, well, it better be 'cause this is what we've been working for since we got here."
This is called destiny.
"You know, there is the..."
- Don't do this to me.
Don't walk out when I need you the most.
Please don't do it again.
Like what you see ?
She's just the greatest kid.
I know it's a terrible parent cliché but she just makes me laugh like no one else I know.
She sounds great.
- You should meet her.
- I'd love to.
"So, what about you ?"
Nothing like that on the horizon ?
"Fatherhood, responsibility ?"
Me ?
"No, not a chance."
Slade said you're seeing someone.
"Yeah, I am."
Laura.
"She's great but you know, early days."
- Are you serious about her ?
- I'm crazy about her.
Is she about you ?
"Of course she is, look at me."
I'm a hell of a catch.
She's just... honestly she's just a bit scared to take it to the next level.
Anyway.
Tell me about...
Stuart.
We met in the States.
He worked in the building next to the hospital where I was working.
"So, I was seeing him all the time."
I've never thought I'd end up with someone in finance.
But he's just one of those people.
"Okay, what's going on Marta?"
Know what I think?
I think you set me up.
I think this amnesia is bullshit.
"No, no."
"Oh, fuck me."
What?
"You're gonna tell me, you don't know who this is?"
Who is it?
"It's Jared, damn you."
"Paolo and Yale are dead, Marta."
Why?
I don't know.
"Alright, I don't remember anything, I swear."
Is Jared a victim too or is he in on this?
"Yeah, um, I'm getting out of here."
What're you gonna do?
It's Kyra.
I told you to turn off your cell phone.
What have you gotten us into?
Why are you calling here?
Because I told her to.
You know she was packing to leave when we got here.
"Oh, I haven't spoken to you since Berlin, partner."
"What do you want, Jared?"
"Oh, come on."
You're a smart guy.
"You've spoken to Marta, you found my place."
You must have figured it out by now.
Numbers to the Swiss bank account.
There ya go.
This can't be agency sanctioned.
"- I mean, it's not good for clothes."
- It's just cheese.
- It's wax.
"It's, like, balled up wax."
"- Oh, the wax."
- I love the happiness of that moment.
- Yeah.
- Look at Jonny's face.
- Yeah.
- John Cho.
- Holla back.
- I love that shirt.
"- I bought that from the wardrobe sale and gave it to Eddie, a.k.a. Jesus Christ."
"- Oh, really?"
You did?
- Yeah.
The hype man knows what you want but he's not sure if you want it enough.
Do you really want it?
Do you really want it?
This was funny.
"So you just randomly picked this extra to be, like, the guy who loves the band, right?"
I didn't even pick him.
"Our AD, Christo, picked him."
"He said, ""You okay with this guy being the fan of the band?"" I said, ""Yeah."""
- Then the backflip.
"- All of a sudden, he can do a backflip and no one knows it."
Right.
"And it was just something he just did, right on a whim?"
"He said, ""Can I dance?"
"Can I do whatever I want?"" I said yes."
- Look at this.
- And then he threw in the backflip.
- It's giving me a cough.
- It is not giving you a cough.
It's lovely.
"Come on, catch up!"
- Over there is a field of rabbits.
- I don't want to see rabbits.
- Is anything superior to this?
- I told you it would rain.
- Blue sky!
Let us chase it!
- I'm not supposed to run.
Are you hurt?
- I cannot walk.
Run and fetch help.
- I will run as fast as I can.
Margaret!
Don't be afraid.
He's quite safe.
- Are you hurt?
- Only my ankle.
May I have your permission to ascertain if there are any breaks?
It is not broken.
Can you put your arm about my neck?
Allow me to escort you home.
At last!
She fell down and he's carrying her!
"Marianne, are you hurt?"
It's a twisted ankle.
It's not serious.
I felt the bone.
And it's sound.
- I cannot begin to thank you.
Been trying to get those two together for a year.
"I did it, and now I'm like a dog off his leash."
"Okay, Dad."
"And let me tell you, I didn't waste any time."
I'm on the Tinder.
"Oh, okay, well, it sounds like you're good."
I'm banging my balls off!
"Medium rare, medium rare."
I want that burger medium rare.
Are you at the OTB?
"Yes, I am."
And you'll never believe what horse is running today...
Daddy's revenge.
How perfect is that?
"I got big money on this one, kid."
They're off!
"Go, go, you son of a bitch, run!"
"Spike him, spike him, you miserable little munchkin."
Hit him!
Hit him like you're wearing big boy pants!
That's it!
"Oh, faster, faster!"
"Santa needs you back at the village, yes!"
"Go, you son of a bitch, go!"
Yes!
Winner!
Revenge!
"Oh, ah, shit."
Dad?
"Oh, shit."
"Hey, Frank, it's me, Smolinski."
"Yeah, I don't know how comas work, but if you can hear me, screw you and wake up, you big shit."
- It was like a blow to me when he passed away.
"- Yeah, it was sudden."
It was
- It was terrible.
I never felt that way before.
He always used to say to me...
"""You know, Claire... if it won't be you, it'll never be anybody else."""
- What does that mean?
- He wanted me to marry him.
- Did he ask you?
- Sure.
- So why didn't you?
- So I said I wasn't ready to -
- I wasn't ready to get married.
- What are you waiting for?
I wasn't ready
- It is a lot of things you have to do when you get married.
Like what?
What did you have to do?
Inviting the people.
There's a lot of work involved.
Yeah.
Sure.
I would have helped you.
Max was a wonderful man.
"- He was never married, was he?"
- No.
- I know that.
- No.
- So you would have been his first wife -
- And again he said to me -
"He always said to me, ""Claire, if it won't be you... it'll never be anybody else."""
"She drank too much, that's all."
"Oh, yeah?"
What about Marseille?
When will you realize nothing's going on...
Too much garlic...
"Let's give her a few days and then, Shai, you go talk to her."
We stressed her out.
You mean I stressed her out?
- I didn't say that.
- Then why did you look at me?
Butt out.
Who asked you?
You're right.
"- Ricky, what are you doing?"
- Going to have some fun.
How did you know my size?
I asked Ricky.
You're tough on him.
"I didn't tell him to come, and you butt out."
Did he cheat on you?
- Did he hit you?
- Are you crazy?
Then what is it?
"You're just like Aunt Rosa, always hiding things."
"That's right, like the adoption thing."
You even hid it from Morn.
Why can't you share?
- None of your business.
- We can help.
How?
You want to be a surrogate mother?
You're such a hypocrite.
"Whatever you need, Mom."
Whatever you need.
Hey.
How was the pier?
"Okay, I'm not being funny, but there was literally one shop."
Are you serious?
"- I know, right?"
- Yeah.
There are more shops than that... in jail.
"Well, I'm sure you found a way to have fun."
Did Mom seem weird to you?
"Um, not more than usual, but she's fine."
Don't worry.
Well...
"I will be in my room, avoiding risky activities."
So... yeah.
Mom just went off on me and made it clear she doesn't want me to ride.
"- Well, did you talk to her about it?"
- Have you met Mom?
Good point.
Mm-hmm.
Anyway...
"How have you been, Dad?"
How's your time-out going?
It's been pretty quiet.
A little too quiet without you guys.
But tell me about that cute little island you're on.
Did Rosie meet the queen yet?
"The queen, she is in London."
And it's...
It's cool.
I met some new friends.
"I had to drive over to Sandy's, mix the stuff, then get back to the gravy."
"Do you think you can come over, fuck me, then leave?"
-Got someplace better to go?
-Don't talk like that.
Come on.
-You all right?
-Yeah.
You believe me?
Do you believe me?
-That's the last one?
-Yeah.
You lying son of a bitch!
I hate you!
Please stop feeding the dog from the table from the plate on top of it.
Stop it.
-l have to.
-You don't have to.
I gotta go home.
What do you mean you got to go home?
We gotta start taping it to your leg.
We got to go soon.
I gotta go home and get my hat.
Forget your fucking hat!
Are you kidding me?
I need a trip to Rockaway because you want your hat?
I got to have it. lt's my lucky hat.
I never fly without it.
Do you understand what we are involved in?
I don't care. I need my hat.
I won't fly without it.
What could I do if she insisted I drive her home for her Goddamn hat?
I hid the package in the kitchen and I went to take her home.
Bye-bye.
"Doctor, this is an emergency."
This man has been shot.
Come on in.
Let's have a look at you.
Here you go.
Let's get some of these things off so we can take a look at it.
Easy...
There.
Now get up here on the table.
Alright.
Now turn a little bit.
Let me take a look at this.
When did this happen?
Just a little while ago on the street.
Hm-hmm.
You know I'm gonna have to report this to the police.
You know who did it?
"A sniper, I think."
"Hand me a shot, please."
"Sniper, huh?"
Is it serious?
"Well, if you mean are you gonna die?"
I don't think so.
"You know, one of the greatest dangers arising from a gunshot wound is infection, but... they have a cure for that now."
This just came out.
I've had some very dramatic results with it.
What's it called?
Penicillin.
There we are.
My forceps.
Does that hurt?
"It's not like this is my spot, this is Seo Yoon Jae's spot."
I'm sure that perfect Seo Yoon Jae will take care of it.
Eat slowly.
It's hot and spicy.
I can't eat this.
Are you going to die if you eat it?
Keep it down and be quiet!
Yoon Jae...
"The food must be spicy for you, so how about a nice refreshing beer?"
Huh?
Alcohol?
Why not?
"Sure, sure."
I'm not going to die if I drink it.
Father...
Yoon Jae has to drive.
Da Ran...
I don't have a car because it was in the accident.
Yoon Jae...
"You're not even well after the accident, so you shouldn't be drinking."
"I think if I have one drink, it'll help me fall asleep easily."
"-Please give it to me, father-in-law."
"-Dad, dad...!"
Me too.
Alcohol for an 18 year old minor?
No way!
A kid can't drink!
You can't...!
No one's going to deny that you're a teacher...
That's right.
"Since I'm a teacher, I can't watch a student drink alcohol."
You don't have to take me back...
"If you get up now, you will finish it in time."
You can work here.
I brought your computer.
There's WiFi too.
This is why I told you not to call me a douchebag.
But this is about finishing work and being responsible.
Just a little bit more.
Only 2 photos.
"If you finish this job, you can rest as many days as you want."
"And when you're done, we'll go to NYC together."
Ok?
So what did you say to him?
I told him I want to sleep.
Damn.
Was Peng angry?
He wasn't.
Just told me to fuck off and change careers.
Don't worry.
I will find you some jobs.
Will you do one thing for me?
Don't do anything stupid like this again.
I'm asking you as your best friend.
Alright.
Je.
You have to have a baby.
What?
I came back from the dead just to see your kid's face.
So you are free today?
Yeah.
I came to take care of you.
I have so much to do.
Number 116.
'
And I'm killing Rambo thanks to you.
You are welcome.
Hang on...so who's guarding the grain store now?
"Oh, yeah, no... no one."
"Oh, shit!"
Stop!
Stop!
Stop it!
Oi!
Oi!
"Well, well, well."
The Professor.
"What brings you out here, then?"
"Oh, just concluding..."
"you know, a big sale."
Pleasure doing business with you!
Uh-huh?
How much did they steal?
Not much.
"A bit, yeah."
"Quite a lot, actually."
"It's fine, though."
I can handle it.
Of course you can.
"If you'll excuse me, I've just bought darling little Rex."
I've got a busy day of stroking ahead of me.
"Out of interest, what would you do if you were me?"
"Some kind of nose job, I imagine."
About the burglary.
"That's easy - make a few cutbacks, fire some of the fat ones."
"And if you're very low on grain, you're gonna have to raise the price."
I don't have time to wait for a giant to fall asleep.
The powder Mulan gave us...
we need to use it.
We gotta knock him out.
"Well, that's riskier."
Than waiting for a giant to fall asleep when we need him to?
Point taken.
"Ooh, you're a tough lass."
You'd make a hell of a pirate.
Who's Milah on the tattoo?
Someone from long ago.
Where is she?
She's gone.
Gold.
Rumplestiltskin.
"He took more than your hand from you, didn't he?"
That's why you want to kill him.
"For someone who's never been in love, you're quite perceptive, aren't you?"
Maybe I was once.
I got doughnuts.
I got jelly.
(Chuckles)
What's wrong?
Nothing.
"No, no."
Hey.
What's wrong?
This was on the wall at the post office.
I didn't even know they did that still.
When did this happen?
I was a janitor in Phoenix... this high-end jewelry place.
The manager was a drunk.
Your friend has a powerful enemy.
It's open season on her and I wanted to be the one to do it.
"VICKI, IT'S ME!"
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN HEAR THIS!
IT'S WINTER!
SHE'S SOME KIND OF DEMON.
WATCH OUT!
You're too late to save your friend.
I'm over here!
Nope!
Here!
- What are you?
- What I am.
- You know.
- Demon.
"There are all kinds of us, with all kinds of hungers."
What are you doing slumming it down here?
Nothing is without purpose.
"You want me, right?"
Why'd you kill the kids?
"I hook them on the bottle, then move them up to the spike."
That's when I feed all their sweet juices.
I had to sacrifice a few to get your attention.
"If your kind get too much of the bug in them, my little ones go crazy and they feed, too."
"That's kind of a win-win, right?"
That tickled.
Darkness is waiting.
Let it wait.
"It'll take a lot more than that to beat me, bitch!"
Henry?
Sorry I'm late.
Sweet ride.
She here?
She's not with me anymore.
You miss her?
Very much.
The mantle's quite pronounced now.
You're almost home.
"Hey, Mom."
Why did you come here?
I needed to see you... in person.
"You didn't ask to see me before,"
- when you were with Musa.
"- I wanted to, but I was afraid."
Of your own mother?
"I thought you would reject me, send me away."
"And yet you ran away from the Hunt, from Abby and the others."
It was too much too fast.
"When I saw Jules, I couldn't handle it, but Musa was right."
I don't belong at the ETU.
"I'm tired of hating myself, of fighting what I really am."
You can help me.
"You didn't raise me as a Hunter, but you can now."
I want you to be my mom again.
Why should I believe you?
"I'm here, aren't I?"
Love does swing the hammer.
"I'm not gonna hurt you, Mom."
Then show me.
Come closer.
It's been ten years since we've seen each other.
The least you can do is give me a hug.
You think I'm gonna hurt you?
You would if Musa told you to.
Are you serious?
Seriously.
Seriously.
I'm glad you think it's funny. making money.
We want you to throw a fight.
I said no.
One thing led to another.
It ended up with me smashing the guy's head in. offered me a deal. they'd set me up with a new life somewhere.
this is somewhere all right.
I fight once in a while.
It stops me going out of my mind and gives me a bit of spare cash.
the Feds don't give you any money?
man.
the fucking assholes-- they literally give me just enough to survive.
That's why I took your deal.
sweetheart.
I'll be right back.
Well... it's good.
We are on.
And the money?
Open book.
Who knows?
000.
But there is one thing.
what's that?
You're fighting Victor.
Do you really have to do this?
Yeah.
I don't want any part of it.
Forget about that shit.
Focus on the job at hand.
Come on.
"Put it down, put it down."
- Let it go.
Put it down.
- I'm taking care of it.
I got it.
Put it down!
- What the hell are you doing?
- I can't work with this guy.
You can't work with me?
"Who do you think you are, lady?"
"I've been here for eight years, and you're just another untalented pretty face."
"- Billy, calm down."
- Untalented?
The ratings keep going up every night.
How do you explain that?
The ratings go up when the jackpot goes up!
"It has nothing to do with you, you moron!"
"Billy, I've warned you before about your attitude."
That's it.
You're out of here.
You're fired.
Somebody call security!
What?
"No, no, fired?"
"Wait, no, don't fire him."
"Look, see, I'm moving it."
I'm moving the cable.
Get him out of here.
"- Stan, don't do this."
"Please, not now?"
"- Come on, I'm sorry."
"- It's too late, Billy."
I think I'm in love already.
Gah!
That would have been a clean 50 from the both of you.
Excuse me.
Which one of you is Dr. William Blunt?
I am.
Is there a problem?
I'm afraid there is.
I need to talk to you about my father.
Arthur Waverly.
You might have noticed we're playing a round of golf here.
"You have a question, call my office."
I'm sure...
That's not how this is gonna work.
We're gonna talk about my father.
We're gonna do it right now.
"Hey, buddy."
This isn't the time.
Maybe you should tell your friends to take a walk.
"It's okay, guys."
Just give us a minute.
I'll see you at the clubhouse.
"Look, I don't know what you think that I could tell you, but..."
How sick is my father?
He has stage four.
It doesn't look good.
That's one.
One what?
I understand that you sent him to Argentina.
I'd like to know why.
I can't discuss private medical records.
That's two.
"I'm taking this, okay?"
Just for a while.
The poor thing.
We hit the deer and his paw.
What do you call it?
The paw.
-The hoof.
-Got caught in the grill.
I got to hack it off.
"Ma, it's a sin to leave it there."
I'll bring the knife back.
Delicious.
Why don't you get yourself a nice girl?
"I get a nice one almost every night, Ma."
But get yourself a girl so you could settle down.
I settle down almost every night.
But then in the morning I'm free.
I love you!
I want to be with you.
Why don't you settle down?
"How's your friend, Henry?"
What's the matter?
You don't talk too much.
Talk.
What are you quiet for?
"You don't eat much, you don't talk much."
-l'm just listening.
"-What's the matter, something wrong with you?"
"When we were kids, the compares used to visit each other."
There was this man.
He would never talk.
He'd just sit there all night.
"Now here I am, and here I'm gonna stay!"
So think it over.
What are you doing here?
"Franz, come home!"
Why that look?
What's wrong?
- It's not a woman's business.
Things will get better.
You think so?
"I've starved and frozen many a time, but things always turned out fine."
So you're Mieze.
I was Franz's girlfriend before.
I'm Cilly.
I don't know a thing about Franz.
"Oh, don't you look smart!"
- What do you want to know?
- Everything!
A guy with one arm ― out of the question!
Buy him a barrel organ or give him a couple marks.
We've got to watch out for him.
You know why.
What good's a guy with no arm?
- Or a guy with no brain!
- Huh?
You can't see he's come to his senses.
He just wants to spy on us!
Rubbish!
I know what he wants.
"I'll try him out, and I'll be responsible."
"Mieze, you've got to watch out for him."
They make him do anything they want.
"I'll get a job, if I have to be an organ grinder."
Who am I kidding?
I'm in no condition to do this.
I'm sorry.
"I'm in no condition to do this, mate."
I'm in no condition.
I'm sorry.
I'm in no condition to do this.
"Oh, goodness."
"Oh, goodness, what have you done?"
"What have you done this time, Jimmy?"
Are you still conscious?
Yeah.
Hello.
You're gonna be okay.
Just gotta get a little bit of power into you.
"Ladies, could you give us a bit of space, please?"
Thank you.
"You're a big deal, you know?"
You're not the only one wronged by Akan.
You and I both want the same thing.
This might hurt a bit.
There we go.
That's wonderful.
Now I can take you back to my lab.
"I'm Jimmy, by the way."
I realize this is all very confusing for you.
"Um, but... it's better if I show you at the lab..."
Hello?
"Oh, spasiba."
They're here.
They must've followed you.
I can't let them see me like this.
"I'll bet you $50,000 i can put it up to 200."
"I'll take you... because if you do that, money won't mean anything."
There won't be any wall street.
"You've lost your reason, jim."
You're getting drunk- drunk with power.
"10,000 at 140."
I'll take it.
"25,000 at 140."
I'll take that.
I'm taking all the gold that's being offered.
"Now, name your price."
"50,000 at 140."
I'll take it.
"100,000 at 140."
I'll buy it!
A million at 140.
And i'll buy that!
"The trading is closed for the day, gentlemen."
"I've found him, josie."
"Well, josie, here i am."
What do you want?
"Nick, is it true- what jim told me?"
That i'm fighting him?
Yes.
"Look, josie, do you think i'd have walked out on him if i didn't have to?"
I'm trying to save him from himself.
He can't win.
"He'll not only be hated, he'll be ruined."
And you'll make millions.
Yes... and it'll all be his if he wants it.
"Josie, we've both got to help him because he's after something that no human being can have."
Are you sure?
Lengthen the crew's mission.
I promised them...
"No, probably not."
Don't worry.
Good-bye.
Isn't that ditch finished yet?
I've hit a rock.
Good luck.
"I can see, in fact. I can hear."
We've reached a dead-end too.
"You're lucky, you have a pickaxe."
We don't have one.
We can't do anything.
I can provide you with a pickaxe.
Our problem can't be solved by a pickaxe.
"If it could, things would be easier."
One blow of a pickaxe would do.
"Instead of a pickaxe, you can offer me some tea."
"Please, help yourself."
"If you give me your Juliet's address, I'll ask her to provide us with milk."
"In the village, knock on any door and they'll give you milk."
I didn't find any.
"Even at the sea, there's no water for me!"
Can't I ask her for some?
No problem.
She's at Kakrahman's.
Go to the village...
You'll find her there.
Kakrahman's house...
"Ask anyone, they'll know where it is."
Get in.
I'm not disturbing you?
I don't know what the problem is.
"Okay, sweet, yes."
Best?
I don't think so.
It's 1 0 after 7. I have to go to work.
Just give me one good reason why we shouldn't.
"God, it's a hundred degrees in here, and I'm about to die."
You're trying to change the subject.
I can't breathe.
"Listen, you can be honest with me."
"No, I am being honest, I can't breathe."
Michael.
I'm not budging till you give me a good reason why we shouldn't.
-Because you've gone completely mad.
"-Come on, no muss, no fuss?"
No family... .
"Yeah, okay, they might be a little surprised."
"You think? "" Hi, Mom, hi, Dad, guess what I did today?"""
-They'd get over it.
"-No, actually, I don't think mine would."
"-Well, they'll have to, because I love you."
-Michael.
It's a great story for our grandchildren.
They'll think we're crazy.
-We would be crazy.
-Do you love me?
"Yes, I do."
"See, you already said, I do."
"That settles it, that settles it."
-We're getting hitched today.
"-Wait, wait, not so fast."
Will I have a bouquet?
"Now, I'm asking you for the last time."
Who were they?
"Now, you're not going to eat until you talk, so you may as well talk now."
"Now listen, Johnny, here."
Listen to me.
"Now, you tell me who those other fellows were and I'll let you go, see?"
"Come on, who were they, huh?"
Who were they?
- Lock him up.
- Mighty cold for this kid in there.
"Well, maybe it'll freeze him into talking."
Okay.
Come on.
I'm gonna find out who those other kids were if it's the last thing I do.
"All right, kid."
Come on.
Get out of there.
You got enough.
Go get your chart and report to work detail.
- I'll try and get you some grub later on.
- Thank you.
Wrap this around you.
I know you don't squeal.
Skinny didn't squeal.
Skinny didn't squeal.
Skinny didn't squeal.
Skinny didn't squeal.
Skinny didn't squeal.
Skinny didn't squeal.
Skinny didn't squeal.
Skinny didn't squeal.
"Here you are, kid."
I was.
"(SHE SCOFFS) Exactly - ""was""."
How long?
(SIGHS) 18 years.
And how many times did you do the dirty on her?
Never.
"Well, it's my life, and actually, I really like it."
"Oh, yeah, so what about the drugs?"
The meth?
"See, I think you've got one... maybe two months before your teeth start falling out."
"Come on, Jenny."
Eh?
"See, the thing is, I don't think you're doing this by choice."
Not really.
That's just a cuddly thought so you can sleep at night.
Nah.
"Need the coinage, rent to pay."
What do you want?
All right.
"Well, I can tell I'm not gonna change your mind, so why don't you just call your mum, let her hear your voice?"
It's not my voice she wants to hear.
She's no different from the freaks that get off on these films.
It's not who I actually am that matters.
It's who they wish I was.
Jen!
- I...
- Tell her I'm fine.
"All right, that's it, the show's over!"
"Come on, show's over."
"Oi, oi, oi."
Jenny Jones...
- Get off me!
- Three.
- Okay.
"Sorry to ask this right after we ate, but did you sleep with that girl, Sunhee?"
No.
Then why'd she stare me down?
Did you two talk?
That's none of your business.
Did you have sex?
Just tell me the truth.
Tell me.
I'm just curious.
I didn't.
I told you I saw everything.
She really just came in and left.
"Plus, she's married."
And I really do not see her as a woman at all.
I'm serious.
So stop talking this nonsense.
"- Ouch, it hurts."
- Why are you lying to me?
Why are you being like this?
I interviewed her because she resembled you.
"I was missing you so much, but you weren't here."
So I just interviewed anyone.
We don't look alike.
And you know how she looks at me?
She got this contempt in her eyes.
Why would she?
She means nothing to me.
She's just nice.
"Actually, I feel sorry for her."
"Go on, and what else?"
"Can I see your driver's license, please?"
But I don't understand how that happened.
I just...
- You lose something?
- A few hundred pounds of baby food.
- Now are you gonna help or what?
- Sure.
Okay.
No problem.
Call Caltrans.
Tell them to get a unit to clear this up.
And will you take over here?
We're supposed to be at central for a court call.
All right.
Okay.
"When you get reloaded, just make sure that latch is secure, okay?"
Yeah.
I'll sit on it if I have to.
I'm sorry.
I could have sworn I locked her up.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
We're late.
Getraer gets nervous when I'm not on time.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, what's he gonna do?"
"I mean, you're already on probation."
Yeah.
"If he had his way, he'd put my whole family on probation."
"Honey, look."
It's gotta be worth at least 40 bucks.
Chippies.
I wasn't trying to make you feel bad.
I know you weren't.
"I mean, I did this to myself."
"I didn't get into college, all my friends did."
"I don't have a job, so..."
"See, there's really nothing for me to go home to."
Hi.
Hi.
Are you ready?
"Uh, yeah, I am."
"Wait a minute, Eric, what are you saying?"
"Cor, I'm not going home."
Cory?
"Eric, please."
Just come to your senses and tell me we're leaving.
"Oh, Cor, I have come to my senses."
This place is great!
"I mean, it's got Irene, it's got soup, it's got pie, why would I ever leave?"
"Eric, it's not your home."
"That's right, it's not."
"At home, I'm a loser."
"Here, I find happiness."
You're trying to take it from me.
"No, Eric."
You didn't find happiness.
You just pulled off the road.
"I mean, you can't stay here for the rest of your life."
You just pulled off the road.
Maybe this is my exit.
"Look, Eric, we've been gone two months, all right?"
Mom and Dad are waiting.
I think we owe it to them at least one of us shows up.
Yeah.
How long do you think we can go on like this?
"Still at this, are we?"
"So, you told me she was dead."
"Look, tell me."
"Burnt down, a man's worth $4.40."
- Excuse me?
- That's what you said.
- When?
- In the car.
"When all's said and done, you know, carbon and minerals."
A human being's worth less than five bucks.
I said that?
"Well, you know me, I talk a lot of shit."
"But if you say I said it, then I suppose I should believe you."
What about it?
We walk.
Both of us.
"Well, you might walk but her..."
That's impossible.
She knows too much.
She's got the codes.
She's got the cypher.
She's compromised.
It's gotta stop.
I'll get you a prescription for Ativan.
That will stop your conscience bothering you.
Yeah.
"Well, take a look at that."
It's a copy of the broadcasts.
The ones she stopped.
Number 14 might be of interest.
"- My Jordans, nigga!"
"- Shit, this isn't good."
- This is not good.
This is not good.
No.
No.
No.
They're coming over here.
- Fucking shit.
Why did you do that?
"- Yeah, I hit a fire hydrant on purpose."
"They're getting weapons, man."
"All right, what do we do?"
What do we do?
"Run, run, run."
"Run, run."
The men are still very jumpy.
A night on the grog will straighten them out.
Nature calls.
What do you think?
I think they started the party without us.
Who are you?
You do realize you only have one shot.
Which means you'll only be able to kill one of us.
And that whoever you do not shoot will have to cut your throat before the other hits the ground.
Ready?
Let the show begin.
Stand your ground.
Stand your ground!
Stand your ground!
Gather around me here!
Captain Taylor.
- I am good.
I am at home.
But I am going out after some time.
Where are you?
"What do you mean, where are you?"
I am busy arranging for your party.
What rubbish!
When did I say to throw a bash for me?
- You didn't say.
But I thought I should give you a farewell party before you leave.
I don't know when we will meet again.
"Karan, you are trying to entice me?"
"Sweetheart, I am not enticing you."
I like you.
I love you.
And you know?
It's not a crime to love.
"Karan, you know it very well that I don't have time.."
..for useless things like love.
"I am focused on my career, man."
That's why I am leaving Jaipur and going to Mumbai.
Okay.
Be focused.
Make your career.
But reach the party by 9 o'clock.
I have called all our friends.
"I am not too sure, Karan."
I will ask my mom and inform you.
Okay?
No asking.
I don't care.
You have to come.
Like every day of my life.
So why haven't you?
I don't know.
Come on.
I don't know.
I don't know.
It's-- I'm scared.
- Scared?
- Yeah.
You?
You're like the most confident person I've ever met.
It's very scary.
where would I go?
What would I do?
Anything you wanted to.
close your eyes.
Trust me.
They're closed. do anything.
Where would you go?
What would you do?
I'm right where l want to be.
You know what's funny?
When I was a kid I used to have the map of the world above my bed.
l would just point at various places-- close my eyes and just point.
And I promised myself that I would go visit those places.
And now I'm older and I'm still here in this small little town and I've never visited those places.
the funny thing is you actually got out. you followed a dream.
I really admire that.
You make it sound romantic.
It is.
Isn't it?
My dad-- he's a real son of a bitch.
Thank you...
for your help.
Your dinner is getting cold.
"I know you're not very happy with me right now, but I am only looking out for your best interests."
I made that noodle casserole you like so much.
"Oh, Amanda."
"Hey, hon?"
Where the hell are they?
"This could be the biggest move you bust all night, so we just wanna make sure you have it down."
Meet her at the door.
Compliment her.
Walk her over to the table.
Offer her a seat.
Yes.
Care to demonstrate?
Would you like a seat?
No.
"No, no."
You have to pull the chair out for her.
Oh.
And then just slip it underneath her as she sits.
Not too fast or you'll take her out at the knees.
Right.
Not too fast.
Why am I even worried?
You'll be fine.
Does it look okay?
?
I love this.
"The lights, the table, everything."
And the window in my room.
How'd you even get the idea for that?
He must've gotten the message.
Christine.
"Uh, I think the guy that you... you know, the other night when you and he... dirty."
All right.
I know.
"Just let him in, okay?"
I'll get this over with.
Thanks.
"Hey, lover."
Hey.
"Mmm, that was nice."
Yeah.
"So, have a seat."
Wow.
I haven't been in a gym in a long time.
Not since my wife left me for her trainer.
"It's okay, though."
It's been great for my daughter.
"She loves her new dad, and... she's in the best shape of her life."
"Look, uh, Stan... the other night, I was in a particularly vulnerable place, and, um, I think what happened between us was a little quick."
"Oh, I know."
Sorry again.
"Oh, no, no, no!"
I-I-I mean that I think we should go back to being friends.
"Yeah, but we were never friends."
"Well... maybe we should go back to being pre-friends, you know, like the way we were last week."
But we-we didn't know each other last week.
Perfect.
Are you breaking up with me?
In a gym?
I can't believe this is happening again!
"Stan, I'm so sorry, I really am."
All right.
"Hey, I was right."
This is the living room.
This is where we live.
And this is the couch where much of the sitting takes place.
"Aren't you gonna show me the, uh, upstairs?"
"Yeah, boy, yeah, boy, yeah, boy."
The upstairs.
I love the upstairs.
"You know, we weren't even gonna have an upstairs, but I made 'em put it in because I knew you were coming."
"Nobody told me about this girl thing, Shawn."
"I mean, no one warned me."
I thought they were just there.
I didn't know they were interactive.
You'll get the hang of it.
Sure.
It's easy for you.
Your hair moves.
- There's other techniques.
- Like what?
I don't know.
I just do hair.
"Yeah, but where do I get my technique?"
Ask your brother.
He's got the boom.
You know what?
Let's just forget this whole subject.
There are a million other things to do in the world.
"I mean, we're too young to worry about finding mates."
- You're right.
See ya.
- Where are you going?
And what if it does?
That means you're in contact with God or the Angel of Death.
Who are you in contact with?
We can't stay here like this.
Who's to say that within a week... I have a feeling it'll happen in the next three days.
You keep repeating the same thing!
"Look, Keyvan, you know what?"
Give me three days.
Just three.
Perhaps it will happen.
- And what if it doesn't?
- let's say it will.
We're wasting time.
Can't you plan things?
Plan things?
"No, I can't do that."
We say the same thing.
"If you can't do it, who can?"
Only God can.
"If it happens, we shoot our report and return to Tehran."
All right.
We just need to know what to do.
Say it takes three months...
- Behzad.
- Yes.
I've brought you bread.
Put it over there.
"Listen, kid, can't you hold your tongue?"
I can.
Who told you to talk about her son leaving?
I can't lie.
It's not a matter of lying.
Good.
I'm sorry.
"- No, no."
We're about to get started.
Have a seat.
Please.
So we can get out of here.
"Anna and everyone, we are required to be here on time."
We have a lot of work to do and it's not fair to the others if we're late.
"Yes, it won't happen again."
I'm sorry.
Okay.
I thought it might be helpful today if we watch the confession again.
Why?
And I don't know how it happened.
I don't.
"Danny, come into my office, please."
I heard about what happened last night.
That was crazy.
Must've been a horrible thing to discover.
First time I've seen a dead body.
It was shocking.
I bet.
I bet.
Did the police give you any trouble?
"Because if they did, I can take care of it."
You know I've got you covered.
"Thank you, Henry."
"No, I think I'm good."
She'd been dead for a couple of hours.
Ruled me out as a suspect.
"And she had a history of abuse, so they're pretty confident it was an OD."
Open it.
"Sure, There's nothing illegal."
And you know my nature.
Why?
Are you my cousin?
You nature depends on my future.
What's all this?
It's all mine.
You wear this!
"No, I sell these."
I was here on work so thought I should bring it.
I thought I'd make some money for the fare.
Please come...
Madam it's a perfect fit.
Show me the bag.
Which one Ma'am?
Right or Left?
Left.
Your left or my left?
Were you born in military?
"Doing left right, left right."
Show me the other one.
Open the zip.
"Ma'am there are two zip, which one, front or back?"
Take him away.
"Check him, open every zip on him."
And if you can't find the zip then rip it then put a zip there.
Then open the zip and then check him.
Everything is sold.
"It's the last one, for you."
Where is the dirty canal?
Why?
"I believe this is yours, my friend."
Thank you for lending it to me.
"But I still came out ahead, which is more than Mace can say."
"I'm close, so close."
One more door.
Yes!
Just one more door.
(sobs) Just one more door and I'm home free!
Wow.
Just... tell me why.
Why did you keep me in the dark for so long?
It's not that I didn't trust you.
I guess...
I just didn't want to share them.
"As long as I was the only human they confided in, it made me feel... special."
I think I know what you mean.
That might be why I've chased the Illuminati for so long.
"People may have thought I was a nut case, but at least I stood out."
"So, you two finally found each other."
"Yeah, I guess you could say that."
"- See you tonight, Captain."
- Have a nice day.
Hacker!
What are you doing in this neck of the woods?
"Oh, passing through."
"Man, you look like you've been through the wringer."
- (laughs) You don't know the half of it.
- (laughs)
"I may know more than you think, partner."
A lot more.
An Illuminati pin?
You?
I will wait for you.
Some people are born to wait.
I will come.
But I will be late.
Okay?

How do you contact her?
How did you know I'm here?
"I cannot reveal anything, for the sake of protection."
"If I kept the names of women I spent the night with, my phone would need more memory."
What?
"I won't be meeting her in the future, so why would I keep her phone number?"
Such a player.
"You really are the one, really unlucky."
Could it be that...
"You like that woman, don't you?"
Your tastes are very unique!
Kim Yeong...
My name is Kim Yeong Ju.
She's related to a case I'm working on involving Mr. Lee Kyeong Wan.
"You, really don't know?"
I don't know.
Okay.
Fine?
Work hard.
Where is this woman hiding?
Excuse me!
Where are you going?
I see you're limping.
"The clinic doesn't have X-Ray, so I'm going to the hospital."
"Wait for me a moment, I'll quckly bring my car."
Get in the car.
I don't want to.
I'll clean up the mess I made.
Hurry!
Get in the car.
"I will take her, just go."
"Her leg is like that, because of me."
What we're gonna do is we're gonna take them out to the ocean.
You can't set them free in the ocean.
They'll die.
They're freshwater fish.
Okay.
"I hear you, sweetheart."
You are so smart.
We'll come up with plan B. We'll come up with a really good idea.
It won't be sort of kind of good.
It'll be a perfect idea.
You'll love it.
"All right, so we're gonna look at lipstick, we're gonna look at jewelry."
"- Shoes, bags."
- We're gonna...
"Oh, shoes."
- You guys wanna look at shoes?
"- Let's look at shoes, please."
"- Yes, heels."
"- Oh, my God, wait a second."
Wait.
- Do you wanna go in here?
"- Can't let them overheat, right?"
"Oh, my gosh."
Are the goldfish coming with us?

Grace.
What...?
All right.
If it's the truth.
It's all right.
She said... she had a dream she was pregnant.
I know this.
"Have you, um, have you seen the original?"
No.
It's in the National Galley.
"It's worth looking at, in the flesh so to speak."
It's very impressive.
Are you religious?
No.
"But, ah, I'm drawn to these images."
Why?
"Looking for reassurance, I suppose."
Have you found it?
No.
But I keep going back to look.
Just in case.
"So, um, what am I supposed to do about this Paul Fordyce?"
I'll let the police know and you should talk to them.
I can get them to pick you up from here if you like?
"Oh, no."
I'll be OK.
Silly boy.
I had a chat with the pathologist.
They're doing quite well.
What do you mean?
They're connecting you with three murders.
Don't get all hu_.
"It's the truth, isn't it?"
"We, or rather you, left a messier trail than I hoped we would."
- No.
"Well, how do you know?"
Ronon is correct.
I can definitely sense it now.
A female.
Ellia?
Get out of the way.
"No, please."
Don't shoot.
She's not what you think.
"She is my daughter,"
she means you no harm.
She's a wraith.
"Maybe so, but she's different."
I swear to you.
Let me guess-- wraith with a heart of gold?
She doesn't feed.
She's never taken a human life.
How is that possible?
"Please, lower your weapons, and I'll explain it to you."
It's all right.
Father...
"No, I won't let them hurt you."
I raised her as my own.
"You live here, together?"
This was part of a mine before the last culling.
"It's not much to look at, I know, but we don't have much choice."
The people of the village would not understand.
"Gee, I wonder why."
The villagers told us there was a wraith in the forest.
It came here in a crashed ship 10 years ago.
10 years ago?
I'm sorry to drag you into this mess.
"Tell me, who's behind all this?"
That's not my game.
I play by the rules.
I knew you would never tell me.
Take care ofJenny.
Weng won't stop until he kills you.
You'd better let me arrest you.
We'll stay here tonight.
"Sidney will bring me my money, and we'll leave tomorrow."
I'm scared those gangsters will find us here.
Don't worry.
This place isn't easy to find.
Why is it so dark?
I can hardly see anything.
"Jeffrey, turn on the lights."
Why don't you turn on the lights?
Jeffrey.
Please turn them on.
There's been a power failure.
Will your friend come back with the money?
I'm sure he will.
I'm sure he will.
Boss.
"Here's the $1 00,000."
Please check it.
You think he can kill Jeffrey?
"Boss, Sidney Fung is here."
What if he betrays you again?
I'd still consider him my friend.
He was so good to me.
- Where isJeffrey's money?
It's humiliating.
Yeah?
"How much did you lose, 500?"
A grand?
This is a way for us to get close again.
"Hey,"
I almost got killed a few weeks ago.
Sorry if it's affected your sex life.
That's not what I meant.
"Why don't you tell them,princess?"
Huh?
It was 3.
"Ladies, tango comes from the portuguese"
"""tangere."""
To touch.
It's all about touch.Not talk.
"Turns out talk is cheap,bro,huh?"
"A little tight,don't you think?"
It's fine.
We'll adjust it when we get in the ambulance.
"Man,look at this,my fingers are turning blue."
"I'm thinking your boyfriend's the senior guy here, maybe he can take a look."
My partner is busy.
I can wait.
"You didn't mean ""senior guy,"" did you?"
You meant white guy.
Is that what you meant?
Ha ha!
That's what he means.Kick his racist ass!
"You,shut up."
"And you, a little respect,or we'll leave you all here."
"I don't need your help,son."
Does she?
- Yes.
Your mother is very intelligent.
"If I get a chance, I would like to meet her."
For sure.
Tell me.
What will you have?
"I am good, sir."
I had breakfast just now.
"If you will call me sir here, you know what I am going to say."
I know.
I know.
Mother.
Anyway.
I saw your designs.
You seem very talented.
But why did you take so much time to express your talent?
"I didn't take time, Vivek."
"Those whom you trust a lot, they took time."
My designs were ready since a long time.
What do you mean?
Who?
I don't want to take anybody's name.
Fine.
Don't take names.
I understand a bit.
"But Gul, if I trust someone, I trust him completely."
What if somebody breaks your trust?
It hasn't happened so far.
"If it happens, I wouldn't want to see his face again."
Can you do that?
"- Yeah, of course."
I order you!
I order you!
You broke it!
You broke my sword!
"You've got a lot to learn about winning, Trelane."
You dare to defy me!
You've got a lot to learn about everything.
I'll fix you!
You cheated!
You haven't played the game right.
I'll show you!
[ Woman's Voice ] Trelane!
No!
No!
You said I could have this planet.
[ Man's Voice ] This has gone far enough.
But you always stop me when I'm having fun.
You're disobedient and cruel.
We've told you before.
"Time to come in now, Trelane."
"I don't want to come in, and I won't."
"I'm a general, and I won't listen to you."
"Enough, Trelane."
Come along.
But why?
I didn't do anything wrong.
I was just playing.
We said come along.
But I haven't finished studying my predators yet.
This is not studying them.
"If you cannot take proper care of your pets, you cannot have them."
"Aw, but I was winning."
He really likes you and John.
I can tell.
Think he looks at y'all like you're some kind of heroes or something.
"Well, we're..."
We're far from that.
"You might want to tell him that then, if you know what I mean."
I've got a little girl in there who needs her daddy.
Dale doesn't know any better.
He watches TV.
I read nonfiction.
"Well, hey."
Hey.
"Hey, John, what do you say we head back?"
"Oh, no, come on, guys."
The night is young.
Y'all want some cookies?
We all do.
"No, we wouldn't dare try."
Very serious meal.
They're in here.
I got to go pee.
Pee off the porch.
Yeah.
Shit.
"You know, Dale..."
This whole case is our problem.
"I mean, what I'm saying is, you can be as involved, or uninvolved, in the actual apprehension of these guys as you want."
Assuming they show up.
"Well, if they do, I'll be there."
You got a nice spot here.
"Nice house, nice family."
You're a lucky guy.
I got addicted to one of those things.
Almost broke up my marriage.
What?
"Oh, no, no."
Not that.
"No, no, no, I met someone, and, you know, we had a nice time-- that's all there is to it."
"Wait, you're not going to see him again?"
"Maybe I will, and maybe I won't."
You can do that?
"Apparently, I can."
"Oh, crap."
Here comes Sad Dad.
Who's Sad Dad?
"Yeah, that's the other side of divorce."
"His wife left him three years ago for her personal trainer and he's been moping around the school ever since, trying to get any woman to show him the slightest bit of attention."
"Oh, that is so pathetic."
Which one is he?
Hey!
"Oh, my God, what are you doing here?"
You looking for me?
"Uh... uh, no, my kid goes to this school."
No way.
"My daughter, Alice, goes to school here."
Wow.
You would think that that would have come up last night.
"Oh, my God."
"No, no, no, no!"
Don't answer that.
Why?
Who is it?
Hi.
We're very busy.
- Cathet...
- Pressure's up to 95 palp.
No gross blood.
Where do you need me?
- We're all set.
- She's good.
"Thanks, Sam."
We'll take it from here.
I'll go check on his kids.
She's really not sure what happened.
She gave herself a good whack in the head.
We can't do anything if she doesn't identify her assailants.
That's okay.
"Like I said, she's not sure what she remembers."
She's not even certain it was intentional now.
Fine.
Let me know if she changes her mind.
You did the right thing.
The next step is to get your wife some help.
No.
The next step is for me to take her home.
"My wife is not crazy, okay?"
She had an accident.
It happens.
"I'd rather she chose to stay, than have psychiatry put her on forced hold."
She's gonna be with me.
She's gonna be fine.
Just leave us alone.
I mean it.
Pressure's up to 100 systolic.
Crit's 28.
Send another 4 units to angio.
"I understand that, and thank you."
Yeah.
"So, uh, what's the plan?"
"Well, 7 AM we leave from here-"
"- Riley, no."
Stop.
He's not part of the crew.
Didn't my sister tell you?
You're not in.
"I understand that, Connor."
"I was just, wanted to see what you guys had planned."
No.
This is exactly my problem with you.
You're problem with me?
"You want me to take care of this, boss?"
Step back.
You just tell me to step back?
Don't tell me to step back.
I'll step back if I want.
"I'll step off, I'll step up to the streets if I want to."
"You know what my problem is with you, Ollie?"
Your lack of respect.
That's my problem with you.
"I, I respect you."
No you don't.
You don't trust me.
Never have.
Maybe that's because you've landed me in jail twice.
That's not helping.
You're not helpin'.
Where'd you get this guy?
I told you to play dead.
"Bankers' conference, Vienna."
Sorry.
- You couldn't tell me any sooner?
"- Sorry, I forgot."
Okay.
Let's go outside and talk.
What is this?
It's quite noisy outside.
What silent kind of a conversation do you want to have?
"We talk a lot, don't we?"
But we don't listen to this.
I think they are both conspiring against us.
We have no control.
So what now?
"So now, let's leave them alone."
They are acting smart.
"It's all about trust, right?"
So let's see what they do when they are alone.
One week.
Away from each other.
And what if they don't mend their ways?
Next level?
Do you really have to go?
It's good in a way.
"If you don't fast, you don't enjoy the feast."
"""Come to me, my love..."""
"""Come to me..."""
"""This helpless soul awaits you."""
"""Come to me..."""
"""Come to me, my love..."""
"""Come to me..."""
"""This helpless soul awaits you."""
"You know, a car is like a man."
It needs to rest and restore itself.
It's given up the ghost.
It's overheating.
Can it be mended?
"Yes, it will work again."
Don't ask so many questions or I'll give up the ghost too... at this altitude.
I've forgotten my book.
- What?
- l've forgotten my book.
"Don't worry, the others will bring it."
I have exams.
They'll be coming up to join us soon.
I have to study.
I'll tell them to bring it.
I have to study to have a good grade.
What a pest...
"Ali, bring him up the book."
Where is it?
On top of the dashboard.
People always come this way?
"No, there are several different paths."
It's a tough one.
This isn't the main path.
Where is it?
It's a long way off.
This path is shorter.
- ls that why we've taken it?
- Yes.
"Wait, why are you going so fast?"
It was the best way!
That's what you want.
And so what if they laugh?
- So what?
- Don't tell me what I know... you haven't been through things like me.
"And I hope I'll never do, if that makes me so scared."
- I'm not scared!
"- Yes you are, Violet."
"You don't trust anyone, or anything.."
You never did.
I trusted you!
What?
I said I trusted you!
When did you stop?
The second I saw that goddamn dress on your back!
That's just perfect then.
Why?
Because now you don't have anything at all.
- So what are you trying to say?
- I just said it.
"Say it again, if you have the guts."
- You heard me!
- I'm gonna kick your ass!
Cut it off bitch!
You're gonna mess up my new dress.
My landlady was coming up the street.
I was just... just messin' with her.
Never shot a gun before.
- How was it?
- What do you aim on for some new shoes now?
- Shut up about it!
- You shut up about it!
- Make me!
- I just did!
- Sorta.
"It's hard work, ain't it?"
"Hey, I'm just happy to help out."
That's what I hear.
"So, uh, can you do me?"
Pardon?
"What you did for lester, i want it done."
I didn't do anything to lester.
"Look, he's right over there."
I sit alone in a room all day praying for death to come.
You got to do this for me.
Please.
Listen to me.
I killed 5 men in my life.
4 of them had slanty eyes and were shooting at me and my buddies.
The other one was a drunk driver who ran over my 10-year-old nephew.
They all had it coming.
"But I'll be goddamned if I'm gonna kill a war hero, a brother in arms."
I just won't do it.
Then you're a fag.
"Say that again, war hero or not, I'll kill you."
You are a fag.
"Ok, all right."
We're on.
5 goddamn miles.
"You know, i nearly had a heart attack."
My legs feel like jell-O.
"Oh, that's all right, dude."
You'll get used to it.
"Yeah, when?"
"Uh, depends on you."
You're pretty good with that thing.
"If Vlad wants his crazy Mexican, he should go after him."
It's pissing me off.
The last girl is off with a client.
"Down, down, down!"
He's gonna get a blow-job here.
"Fuck, he must be desperate to get a woman here."
What do you care?
You don't come here on holiday.
You're right.
I forgot that you were an expert.
You're out of line.
"Fuck, you're becoming a pain, Gilou."
- We can't say anything any more.
- Don't worry.
You'll soon be rid of me.
And Laure?
Tell me it doesn't hurt to leave her.
"Me, I would understand, but Laure?"
"Go ahead, say it."
Say it!
They're moving.
Gilou to Laure.
"The guy is going away with the girl, what do we do?"
We follow?
"No, we wait."
They're done.
Let's go.
Why don't they come back?
Are you sure the pimps didn't pick them up?
They must have picked them up somewhere else.
"We'll come back tonight, we've got to stay on their back."
"Everybody, get some sleep."
- l don't know anything.
- Not even the shake?
That's the first time I've heard of it.
- Would you like to dance?
- Are those sandwiches good?
Excellent.
"But if you want to dance, go ahead."
"Come on, what are you afraid of?"
I don't know what to do with my feet.
"No one else knows any better, don't be silly!"
But they know I can't dance.
You're not a little boy.
We're already in the ninth form.
"We are, but I don't know how to."
What does that matter.
Do you think anyone knows?
I'm not going to make a fool of myself.
"No one knows, they just jump around."
"Come on, what harm can it do?"
"If I don't know how to dance, I won't."
Excuse me. I'll tidy myself up a bit.
My wife...
- What is it?
- Come in!
Come in!
This is my wife.
"If you don't mind, I'll change."
"I'll take this T-shirt off, it reminds me..."
"This way, please."
They've come about...
- l don't know what.
- Your son.
"Well, it wasn't just that."
"When we met, it was like fate brought us together."
Now what's it doing?
I'm not a big believer in fate.
"Yeah, well, I hate fate."
"Oh, let's not make it mad, though."
I can't believe this.
I'm gonna take the car to go get some coffee with this guy.
What?
I'll be back soon.
"He's really, reay nice."
And he likes my hat.
Okay.
"- So, you're happy."
- Me?
"Oh, yeah."
It's all good.
"I mean, Yonk's a lot older, so we're into different stuff, and-and we have different friends."
"And he's away a lot, promoting the Yonk Allen Barbeque Grill."
Okay.
"But, I mean, how cool is it?"
I'm married to Yonk Allen.
It's-it's awesome.
"Yeah, I mean, he was a huge football star, so, you know, he... got hit in the head a lot."
"But he takes really good care of me, and he's very sweet."
"Sometimes mean, but-but mostly sweet."
"Well, yeah, that's - that's just like your dad."
- Yes.
- Yes.
"Hey, babe."
Time to go to the airport.
I'll be right there.
- Good!
Why isn't the sign up?
Hi everyone.
"Well, at least it's finished."
When do I get the money?
When this thing is up.
Tell me Nora.
Wouldn't you rather work over there with us...
Instead of wasting your time over here.
Oh no!
We're wasting our time.
What's going to happen to us.
We won't survive!
He's got a screw loose!
"By the way, does your brother have the money?"
"Yes, he has the money."
You can pick it up right now.
Finally some good news!
"Great, right?"
Maybe something will actually come out of your hotel.
Although I would fire the bellman.
He's got a screw loose.
Tom?
Tom is the way he is.
"But you Toni, how are you?"
I don't have a screw loose.
I'm an entrepreneur.
But I shouldn't say that too loud.
And what else are you?
The sign goes up tonight.
It's taken long enough.
"Hi there, I heard you have my money."
"Head to the south, See what I can find."
"Yeah, copy that."
Didn't see once piece of gold In that hole.
Am I headed In the right direction?
You need to turn right.
Turn right.
Look where he is.
He's way out there.
He's on his own.
I don't know.
It's looking like.
"All the right materials, Nice heavy material,"
But there ain't Anything here.
Now I'm starting to get Worried.
I can't see over here.
100 miles East of nome.
At the bluff...
Shawn pomrenke's Pump motor has run out of gas.
"And within seconds, mr."
Gold Will be out of air.
Here he comes.
We ran out of gas.
Umbilical's All twisted up.
Oof.
Out of breath.
That was a lot Of hard work that time.
When Just doesn't go right.
"When things are breaking And there's no gold,"
It gets stressful.
"As soon as that pump died, I could tell the air pressure."
Was dropping And I was losing air.
It was off.
It doesn't come up that often.
Maybe it's the neighborhood.
T om.
-Larry.
-Wow.
"Well, it's not the battery."
"In the morning, I'll check the fuel line for you, the alternator, the pump."
"You know, it could be your plugs are worn down."
I'll replace them for you in the morning.
"In the meantime, uh... could I give you a ride home?"
"Um, no, I can walk."
"So, what do you think?"
Can you help him?
I'd much rather do something for you.
"Well, what could you do for me?"
"Well, it seems like you've forgotten just about everything."
"Well, I remember the basics..."
but it's...
I'm not concerned about myself.
It's Frank I'm worried about.
"You know, it's just not that important to me anymore."
Poor man.
Look at that woman.
"Oh, my God."
Her top is so low.
And her skirt is so high.
That is bad.
It is.
"It's very, very bad."
"Are you, uh... what I think you are?"
"Well, I'm not the public health nurse."
Would you...
I'll manage.
I told the cleaning lady to come twice a week too.
Absolutely not.
The way things were was fine.
It won't be the same.
What?
Dust?
I can dust.
I have to get the money from the account that Grandpa left.
We have to go to the bank.
Okay.
"Besides that, I'll arrange some more money."
I don't need you to arrange for me.
I need you to sign as a guarantor on the contract.
Did you notice that the bathroom light is flickering?
Yeah.
"It's like a discotheque, it needs to be checked."
I'll handle it.
Good.
Can I take this?
Of course.
You didn't forget anything?
I have everything.
You're sure?
- I'm sure.
"No, no, I'll take the dishes later."
Are you not feeling well?
"No, I'm fine."
Do you feel sick?
- It's nothing.
Want me to get you some glycerin?
"No, I don't need any."
You wouldn't listen!
I told you to tell him!
Keep your pants on!
"All right, boys, break it up!"
"The other eye, Nelson!"
Close the other eye!
"Ten seconds, Stoke!"
Get in your shell!
Cover up!
Cover up!
"Break it up, break it up!"
Go to your corners!
"Break it up, the bell rang!"
- What's got into him?
- He's got to make it look good!
"Yeah, yeah!"
"But we finish him the next heat, don't we?"
"Yeah, the next heat!"
"Here you are, get your fresh-roasted peanuts!"
"Get all the peanuts you need right now, folks!"
There's not many left!
"I told you to get in a shell, didn't I?"
You see his face when I gave him that right?
- He'll murder you now!
"Won't he, Tiny?"
- Red's got something!
- What do you mean?
- Play it smart!
"Keep away from him, and you'll go the distance!"
My only chance is to deck him!
It's better to go the distance than get your head knocked off!
Get your cold beer here!
It isn't rare to find destructive even criminal behavior.
"Hey, do me a favor, will you?"
Tell me something good.
Don't be alarmed.
"If it's a lesion, in a way, she's fortunate."
All we have to do is remove the scar.
-Let's move her.
"- Regan, can you sit up, scoot over?"
A little more.
Good.
"Regan, I'm just gonna move you down on the table, okay?"
Let me do this.
It's okay.
See?
There we go.
It's just for a short time.
You're doing fine.
Very sticky.
Good.
"Now, Regan, you're gonna feel something a little bit cold and wet."
Okay.
Now you're gonna feel a little stick here.
Don't move.
Good.
Okay.
You're gonna feel some pressure here.
"Now, don't move."
Hook up.
There's nothing there.
No vascular displacement at all.
Do you want me to run another series?
I don't think so.
I'm in jail.
I can't stop people from coming to see me.
Let her sneak this stuff in for you every week.
Let her fight these bastards every week!
Look what you're doing!
Stop it!
I'm sorry.
Let her sneak this shit in for you.
Will you stop it?
-Let her do it!
-Stop it!
Nobody's helping me. I am all alone.
Belle and Morrie are broke.
I asked your friend Remo for the money he owes you.
He told me to take the kids down to the police station and get on welfare.
"Karen, lt's going to be okay."
I've never seen Paulie since he got out.
I never see anyone.
That's what happens when you go away.
We're on our own.
Forget everybody else.
Forget Paulie.
As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
-l can't do it.
"-Yes, you can."
All I need is for you is to keep bringing me this stuff.
I gotta guy in here from Pittsburgh who's gonna help me move it.
In a month we're gonna be fine.
We won't need anybody.
I'm afraid.
I'm afraid if Paulie finds out....
He is not helping us out.
I'll go up the hill.
"If we're cut off, call me back."
I can't call you.
Hello.
"Are you well, Mrs Godarzi?"
"Sorry, it takes a few minutes to reach the high ground."
You can't foresee that.
"One day she's well, the next she isn't."
Her condition varies.
We're all waiting.
We have to wait.
She has company.
Her son has come a long way.
He's waiting like us.
When will we be back?
In a couple of days maybe.
Good-bye.
I knew that warm voice belonged to a warm-hearted man.
Hello.
How are you?
It's deep!
"Three metres, as stated in the contract with the engineer."
I think you may be right.
Working alone is better.
It's harder... but there are advantages.
- Do you understand me?
- No.
I mean that no one bothers you.
A boss.
You don't have a boss.
Yeah?
He comes and disturbs us.
The stuff you can't see.
I've known Walter my whole life.
God!
He's a decent man.
- He's a good man.
- But this is tough stuff.
This is body bag stuff.
Tell me if there's some other way.
There's isn't.
Die's been cast.
It was cast a long time ago.
Go easy.
Give him a blindfold and have mercy.
"Walter Stern was a tough man, but he was fair."
We give back the same.
No?
And you be careful.
Keep George with you.
Let him drive.
I got to go in here.
I knew James Wakeley would surface just as I knew when that bullet hit that boy it would keep traveling.
And find its way...
To me.
If only it had found me first.
It is not the way of a lust people !
"How could you lie to me, you butcher !"
How could you make me love you ?
I did not give you permission to leave !
She doesn't need anyone's permission.
Let her go !
Enough of this childishness !
Throw them in the slave pits !
"- Couldn't lend us a ten-spot, could you?"
"- Yeah, course, our kid."
"Cheers, bro."
"- Nicely, nicely!"
- That's a bit of a relief.
Bit of a relief?
Bit of a relief?
I feel like I've just done a dump the size of a man's head.
Troy?
"Look, about that tenner."
There's... no rush for paying' us back.
As long as it's within one calendar month.
"- Moz, I know we've never been close..."
"- No, we hate each other."
"- No, we don't."
"- We do, don't we?"
We might.
"Look, I don't want to see you get hurt."
You can't always trust your friends.
- Aye aye!
- Or the law.
"Yeah, well, sayonara, Señor Paranoia!"
"All right, filth?"
Still got that tattoo of a Dalek on your arse?
"I can't stay long, Moz."
I'm mounted.
"What, you left Shergar outside?"
You'd best leave.
The kids round here'll melt him down for glue.
"Right, then, Moz, we'll be off..."
"Right, then."
"See you, lads."
Phew.
"Listen, O'Leary, I know we're up against it time-wise, but, er..."
"Yeah, big time."
"We've got like, we've got to save Simon."
"Dermot, give me a second."
There's a bit of a big deal happening.
Right.
"Sid Lowecroft is leaving, um, this is a little present for his daughter."
"Oh, OK."
Put this on.
But he doesn't know who I am.
"That's what the whole kick is, he'll get a kick out of the new guy."
"He won't get a kick out of it, he'll go, ""Who are you?"
"""Why are you gate-crashing my last day?"""
"No, he won't, as soon as he walks in, blow that."
"Then give him the doll, read out the letter."
Yeah.
It's some kind words that I've written down for him.
OK.
And then let one of these bad boys off.
"Doll, letter, boom."
Bingo.
I'm going to go and get the cake.
Let him know that we're ready.
You're not in this with me?
"No, no, no, no, I'm just going to go and get a cake."
"Right, hide under there when he comes in."
Right.
Are you ready for this?
Under there?
"Yeah, under there."
Under there.
The film that we might work on together is actually sort of about that.
You're gonna work with Jim Jarmusch?
I don't want to go to a bar on Smith street.
Let's just go back to my place.
"I live with my dad, but he'll be out tonight."
- We can have a drink there.
- What year are you again at N.Y.U?
- Senior.
- Senior?
Okay.
"Wait, so you're 22, right?"
I'm going to be soon.
I'm 21.
"You don't think i'm too old, do you?"
I'm 30.
30 is cool.
I've been with guys older than you.
But are you a man or a boy?
"Well, what's the difference?"
With a man... you feel like you're being taken and you like it.
And with a boy you feel like they're stealing something from you and you don't like it.
This is it.
Thank you.
"Shit, my dad is home already."
We can go to seventh avenue and grab a drink.
We're going in his office.
It's fun in there.
It's a beautiful brownstone.
- Your dad's a therapist?
"- Yeah, he's a pain in the ass."
He thinks he's the Carl Jung of Brooklyn.
I like Carl Jung.
Wait!
These are only lemon sharks!
This is all part of the course.
It is like life.
Like in relationships.
They will not attack unless they feel attacked!
"Marcel, I need you to take the French out of your mouth and tell me what to do!"
Don't let them see your fear.
"Okay, I think we just hold tight, we play it cool, we don't make a move."
What was that?
What?
What was that?
"Jason, stop..."
He said not to panic!
He said not to panic!
I'm sitting in blood!
I'm sitting in blood!
"Marcel, this isn't a drill, buddy!"
You got real sharks here!
It's time to get the guns' and it's time to shoot some fish!
"Here on Eden, there are no guns!"
You got an American life at stake.
One life is not more important than another.
What do I do?
My friends and my wife left me to die.
"You must get out of the chum, but slowly."
Okay.
Swim slowly out of the chum!
Slowly.
Slowly.
"Yes, yes."
"Slowly, baby!"
Let's get her on the phone.
I'll tell her myself.
You leave my wife out of this.
You dragged her into it when you broke the law with your boss.
"You pay, she pays."
Hmm.
He's about to fold.
And admit what?
"If I had my way, damn near everything."
This guy washes stark's underwear.
He knows.
"Hey, it's just getting good."
I should get back to my station.
I'm sure the last thing you want is to put anna on a plane
And have to explain why.
"All right, I'll let you take my shift."
"It's a one-time offer, carter."
Carter!
"Excuse me, chief dooley."
"I need your signature, sir."
What?
Can't it wait?
I'm afraid the codes are ready for analysis.
I need your approval.
Thank you.
Why don't you sit here awhile?
Think about it.
I'm gonna get a coffee.
You want something?
That's my cue.
What do you think?
I think he's on the verge of telling you
She's not feeling that well.
"Aw, no."
I'm sorry.
"No, it's nothing serious."
"I just haven't seen her in a while, so..."
I thought that...
My mom is not sick.
She's not sick.
Okay.
Where you going?
Away.
With a man I met from EST.
"What do you mean, ""Away""?"
Away.
I don't know.
"Uh, for a few days."
"We've, um... had this emotional connection for some time, and we just want to see if there is something else there."
You're telling me you're going to have an affair?
Sandra?
I might.
I don't know.
At least I'm being honest.
Go ahead.
Tell me that you're not having an affair.
I'm --
You know what kills me about the whole thing?
"Is that you didn't have any idea anything was going on -- you, Mr. Counterintelligence Genius."
You just didn't see it?
So you either didn't want to know or you didn't care enough to pay attention.
Who is he?
"Oh, it doesn't matter, really."
"- Who is he, Sandra?"
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Was I too loud?
"No, that wasn't bad at all."
Thank you.

"Listen, you're here a month and sometimes I know he doesn't come home at all."
What kind of people are these?
-What do you want me to do?
-Do?
What can you do?
He's not Jewish.
Did you know how these people live?
Did you know what they were like?
Your father never stayed out all night without calling.
Stay out?
"Daddy never went out at all, Ma!"
Keep out of it!
You don't know how I feel!
How do you feel now?
You don't know where he is or who he's with!
He's with his friends!
Dad!
Will you leave him out of this?
He's suffered enough.
The man hasn't been able to digest a decent meal in six weeks.
Where were you?
Why didn't you call?
We were worried to death!
A married man does not stay out like this!
Normal people don't act like this!
What's wrong with you?
You're not normal.
She's right!
"What's wrong with you, Henry?"
What kind of person are you?
You've had your wishes.
"Now, it's my turn."
And now I'll know when they're coming for me.
"And if I can see them,"
I can kill them.
I bet you didn't see that coming.
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
I had to use the Tesla.
He's dead.
You killed him.
"- Pete, what's going on?"
- Change of plans.
"What do you think, I'm an idiot?"
Don't answer that.
"Look, just stop, okay?"
Just put down the gun and let's think this through.
- I'm still taking the artifact.
- I can't let you do that.
"Die trying to stop me, Alice."
"Oh, clever boy."
What tipped you?
The real Myka... would never kiss me.
Never!
Not if her life depended on it.
- Which is...
- A shame.
You're a good kisser.
- So Artie hasn't figured this out yet.
"- Well, not yet."
"But when he does, he'll set the real Myka free, and you will... poof... disappear."
"It doesn't work that way, Pete."
Then you bring me here?
How can i left you there?
Laxmi Narayan.
Now pain is gone?
Pain has just started.
What is she doing!
Why are you taking off your cloths?
How can i show you then?
No... no!
This is wrong... now i got your nature.
And you know my nature.
Laxmi Jee Relax... that's what happen in this age.
I am sorry... why?
Because of the way talked to you.
When?
When i told you to shoot me.
What was you fault...
I am not like that.
"If i didn't had problem, i would never say like that."
After my father left.
I am all alone.
Have to leave this house too.
"You know, that Mundaya was saying... if i don't pay him the money, i have to marry him."
"Better is that, i should kill myself i will kill you... if you talk like this."
"I am here, here it is, how much you need?"
I bought 25000/- only 25000/-?
"Don't worry... take this chain, worth 24000/- only?"
"Only means, its fake."
Take this ring.
It was for my just wife.
Just wife?
Yeah i just told Mina gay my wife.
A flower van.
You know what you should do is a garbage truck.
"Seriously, and I don't mean to disrespect but if you put cops in the back of a garbage truck there's no way I'm seriously thinking that there's cops in the back of a garbage truck."
"It's a freebie, yo."
Just think about it.
"Think about it, boys."
All right.
I'm hitting it.
You dudes give up that easy?
I'm not a cop.
Then lift your shirt.
Show me you're not wearing a wire.
"All right, you know what?"
Just to show you you're being an asshole.
I'm blinded by white.
Douchebag.
Come on.
I was joking.
Come on.
Don't walk away angry.
Sit down.
Come on.
"I mean, what are you complaining about?"
"You got abs, man."
Kind of.
"Whatever, dude."
I'm not even sure I wanna buy anymore.
I think you turned me off to the whole thing.
Come on.
Don't be like that.
"I just need you to prove it, you know?"
Prove you're not a cop.
Oh my God.
"You covered ""how will I know"""
And you dedicated it to me
And I sat there trying not to laugh.
Oh God.
I was so in love with you.
What are we doing?
Things were so much easier when we were younger.
Unlike our kids we just jumped into things.
"I mean, why can't we just be more like that"
Just figure it out as we go along?
Maybe this didn't turn out to be
The romance we thought it would be when we first met.
Well.
It's more like choose your own adventure.
Maybe it just wasn't the right time.
Maybe it never will be.
What if it is?
What if we're just too stubborn to see it?
I don't want to miss out.
Well...
Neither do I.
I don't have a ring
So this will have to do.
Rufus.
What are you doing?
"Marry me, Lily."
Marry me.
I know that'll make me your... uh your fifth husband.
So?
Yes.
Give me your hand.
What's this?
I'm the Boss after all.
I always carry my portable lobby along.
Sit.
Where do I sit?
Here.
Don't sit there you fool.
It'll crack the eggs.
So there are eggs inside?
No.
There are nails.
They'll pierce through.
Yes Mr. Thakur.
How can I be of service?
Are you going to kill Shiv in jail?
Why are you being so eager Thakur?
I know all about you.
First you clear the garbage and then your record.
Thakur.
If kill him in your jail... won't there be an investigation on you?
The media's been showing your footage with that boy... and boring you to death.
If kill him won't you be blamed?
He's right.
Then what do we do?
It's simple.
We won't kill Shiv in jail.
We'll get him out first and then...
Superb.
Let him escape.
What do you say Ayushman?
Let's make him flee from jail.
Stupid fool.
"Yeah, I know."
He's in the city on important business.
- He'll be back soon.
- Uh-huh.
That's what you think.
Everybody says he quit us for something better.
- That's a lie.
- What did he hang it on a limb for?
He didn't run out on us.
I'll beat up any guy that says he did.
"Well, I was only telling you what everybody's saying."
What's the matter?
Don't you like it?
Stinks.
"What's the difference, if it's a nice room?"
"Besides, you're only gonna be here a little while."
- Get down to that hospital.
Go ahead.
- I'll keep calling you.
Get that mug anything.
I don't want him to die on me.
What's the matter?
Just when I get everything set up at school.
I have to knock off that gorilla.
Don't tell me you're worrying about that joint?
Yeah.
Go on.
Get down to the hospital.
- Go ahead.
Beat it.
Go ahead.
"- Okay, okay."
"- Write, I guess."
Write?
What about?
You've had no life!
"Anyway, it doesn't matter."
I don't want it anymore.
I didn't know you before.
You were just some bloke.
But now...
We're friends.
I think.
I don't want to do it.
The money's not important.
"It might not be to you, but it is to me."
I want some of that to go to Frances.
Ten grand.
"Look, Paul, son."
"If this weekend showed me anything, it's that I want some good to come of my passing."
"Now, if I jump from that bridge, the only thing I would've left behind was a traffic jam all the way up to the Angel."
This way...
I get to give something to me little girl.
That's something I wasn't able to do when I was alive.
And you'll get your money.
Everyone's a winner.
- Now that's how I want it.
"- For fuck's sake, I don't want the money!"
I'm an idiot.
I didn't think things through.
"It seemed like a good idea at the time, but it's not."
It's crazy.
I can't do it.
I won't.
The house was gone.
It wouldn't be the worst thing to stay here a little longer.
It's comfortable.
"Well, depends on your definition of comfort."
"I mean, Al, I'm hardly ever here."
"It's not for me, it's for you."
Is it?
-Can you get me some lemonade?
-I'll see if there's some around.
-How'd you sleep?
-I don't know.
Whatever you hit me with took me down.
I feel fucking drugged.
"Yeah, well, you were drugged."
-I don't like downers.
-You weren't liking the uppers either.
Yeah.
-I told you not to call my house.
"-Look, I had to contact your family."
You're underage.
That's the law.
My mom's gonna kick my ass.
"I mean, she's freaking now."
But she's gonna torch my fucking ass when I get out of here.
Why are things so wrong with your mom?
I don't know.
You seem like you do.
"She just doesn't get me, all right?"
"She's in my face about my grades, my hair, my friends, tattoos."
All this other shit.
You know?
I can't do nothing right.
"Just get off of him the best you can, but don't let him roll in that saddle."
I think that...
I need that horse!
Shit.
Stop that horse!
I need that horse.
Get that horse.
I can understand you smaller children... but you older children have no excuses.
"So, we're going to stay until you get it right."
"Now, I don't want any erasures, so turn the page and start fresh."
Put that mouse in your pocket.
I brung you a horse.
Class dismissed.
"Lord, it's like a stampede."
- I'm not dressed for riding.
- Sure.
Go on home.
Go on.
- I'm not dressed for riding.
"- Why, sure you are."
"Why, women ride all the time dressed like that."
I busted that horse for you.
"Come on, I'll boot you up on him."
- He's beautiful.
- He's a good horse.
"Come on, I'll put you up there."
Okay.
Done.
You all right?
- How do I get...
- Take hold of these reins.
"Grab his reins, grab a little handful of his mane."
It hurts when I breathe.
"Okay, Judy, I think you've broken your breastbone."
"Add a sternal view, troponin, CT of head, abdomen and pelvis."
What else can you tell us about the vehicle?
There was a bike rack on the roof.
They tried to force me off the road.
They wanted to steal my car.
Am I bleeding?
You hit the window.
It's not bad.
Will I need stitches?
"Did either of them have a weapon, ma'am?"
I don't know.
It happened so fast.
I just wanted to get out of there.
Enough for now.
She's had a concussion.
We need to let her rest before she goes up to the CT.
- We're working here.
"- Sorry, Luka."
We've got a trauma.
We need the room.
"All right, here we go, gently."
Lift up the neck.
"On my count, one, two, three."
Here we go.
We're out of infant C-collars.
Luka do you know if we have any infant C-collars?
You can use towel rolls.
Airway is patent.
I can't hear breath sounds with all the crying.
- Do we have a sat?
Is everything okay?
"Pete, it's over."
We won.
Wait.
W-What does...
What does that mean?
Lance offered me the cash.
Oh.
Great.
You bet your ass it's great.
"Our con was so good, we got paid in phase 1."
Not bad for first timers.
"Uh, yeah."
We're naturals.
"I mean, technically, Lance won, but... but the important thing is that you got the money back, so that's good."
Hold on.
Hold on.
W...
"What do you mean, Lance won?"
It's called a Jesus con.
We never talked about this?
"A guy lights your house on fire, and then he shows up in the nick of time to put it out, making himself your savior."
A con man's not always after money.
Julia will think he's the hero.
She'll never believe my side.
"But the important thing is you got the money, so..."
What if I turn it down?
Why would you turn it down?
If I do... can we still con him?
"Grandma, let's just think about this for a second."
- A bird in the hand is worth...
- No.
I haven't felt that from you in years.
I'm sorry about that.
"Okay, so now, finally,"
Are you guys gonna get back together?
- I don't know.
- Me either.
- I have no clue.
- Me either.
- It's all new to me.
- Me too.
But look at you.
Look at the way you finish each other's sentences.
"Look how upset you were when she didn't call you back,"
And look how you didn't want him to know that you were back.
Look at all of it.
Can't you see?
This is who you are.
You're mom and dad.
"We are, but we're not alan and elaine anymore."
We're alan and elaine.
I'm glad you stopped by.
Me too.
I'll see you on the strolling path?
Until the strolling path.
"Got to hand it to you, David."
You make one hell of a wingman.
"Thanks, dad."
Where are you going?
To get Rita.
I'm not leaving you here alone with that whore.
Inspired by the events that occurred on social networks.
What's with your attitude?
You don't think I was worried as well?
What are you doing?
I'll take a taxi.
Why?
Hurry and get in.
I'll be more comfortable in a taxi.
You should go first.
You're trying to avoid me nagging.
Yes.
"Fine, do as you like."
Stop it!
Hurry!
"Listen, just listen, all right?"
All right.
Take a deep breath.
As deep a breath as you can take.
You're so mean.
This is why you woke me up?
"I was right, wasn't I?"
There's no one here.
I was really curious how it would be like under water.
You're such a pervert.
We...
We what?
How will we be living in five years?
How will it be in ten years?
How will our feelings have changed?
What kind of person will you remember me as?
And when will I be able to let you go?
Will I be able to let you go?
"In five years, you'll probably be a father."
You know we wanted to be pregnant by now.
I can't take that kind of time off work right now.
"Besides, we need my income."
That's not an issue.
Come on.
I don't know if I'm ready.
What if we lose us?
Jess.
You will never lose me.
So what was it like in prison?
It's actually not so cracked out to be.
"If you could start your life over, what would you do different?"
Be someone else.
"That's sad, Roman."
Anyone can change.
"Change is a choice, you know?"
Change is a choice?
Where'd you read that?
Just made it up.
So when will I see you again?
Hard to say.
You're not going to do anything stupid are you?
"See, right there!"
That's what it's like being me!
Everyone always thinks I'm up to something.
I wonder why.
You're sexy when you work.
Norman.
"Right, hang on."
Lucky coin.
Damn it.
"You know, no one ever died from taking a day off."
You're both disgusting.
I don't want to be the guy gossip girl made me out to be.
So what are you gonna do?
Go backpacking... if you'll have me.
"Well, it's too late. i'm..."
I'm taking someone else.
"- Oh, really?"
who?
- It's me.
Him.
"Yeah, we're gonna have a great time."
Melissa and i.
Oh. really?
Daniela.
- Close.
- It's Vanessa but thanks for trying.
Please let me go with you.
I'm always doing what everyone else wants me to do.
I want to do something for me.
And we'll just go as friends.
Don't worry. it won't be anything romantic Unless you know we drink a little too much in Vienna one night.
How could you say no to that?
Seriously.
As long as you take off that ridiculous tie
So i can maybe try to picture you with a backpack.
What's wrong with my tie?
Mm. i need a coffee.
He's always wearing a tie.
So i'm the one who does the good deed
And that guy goes off with the girl?
It's good to be that guy.
Do you...you go here to n.y.u.?
"By the end of this, one out of four people in this country will know who you are."
The monkey too.
How does that sound?
What's that going to get me?
That would be great for you!
There's no file.
What do you mean there is no file?
There never was a file.
Then make a file.
"Sure, then tell me where to start."
I will.
Now.
Soon.
Stamps?
- Stamps?
What should I do with those?
I don't write letters.
I don't have anything else.
"I know, I know."
How long can you get by with this here?
"Franz, are you still there?"
Yes!
How long can you get by with this here?
I won't be here for a while you know.
Where will you be?
"Yeah, up north in Scandinavia."
Scandinavia?
That should be nice.
That's what I'm saying.
You have to make sure that you and your comrades here are taken care of.
I gave that poetry book of yours to Roswitha for her birthday.
She was quite delighted.
MAN:
You go get her.
Tell her to come out.
Tell her to come out right now!
Take a fucking seat!
We know you have to open the door from the inside.
Can you get her to do that for us?
It'll be a lot easier.
Fuck you.
I need to get inside the broadcast room.
I need the girl to open the door.
I need her to take care of some numbers for me.
Now this is something only she can do.
And I'm kinda on a tight schedule.
katherine:
They didn't know about the change in schedule.
We got here early.
I know about you and the girl.
"We know, okay?"
"Now we can offer you two a way out, a way through."
"And if you do what we say, if you help us, we won't have to hurt her."
There's no need for violence.
Violence is what got us all in this place to begin with.
This is the end of violence for us.
This is a new beginning.
It's a partnership.
And it starts by you getting her to open that door.
DAVID:
Fuck you.
EMERSON:
"Oh, shit."
Your leg.
Simon!
I'm coming!
Why is he being like that?
He's just drunk.
He'll come round.
LOVE
The perfect girlfriend would be...
Sweet and loving...
Back you up even in bad times.
Love...
I don't know if I've tried it...
"Well, of course I love all my friends."
I love mum and dad.
But real passion... no.
There's status in having the right boyfriend.
It gives you status.
If you're rich with loads of money it isn't cool to have a poor boyfriend.
A student on a... grant or whatever they go on.
The boys have most of the say.
It's always been like that among people like us.
They make the money.
She has to look good.
Of course she has to be nice.
If I'm going to marry her and have kids   and a joint bank account and all that shit   she's got to be nice.
- Is Sofie OK?
- Ask her.
- What happened?
- He doesn't want to discuss it.
- My sister's in a porn mag.
- Where can I get a copy?
- At the kiosk.
- You sisters are so fucked up.
"Bu next time you're staying, all of you."
Bye.
- Have a good night.
Come on you guys.
I don't mean to be rude but Can I get an autograph?
Oh yeah sure.
Thanks.
I'm a big fan.
Thank you.
Wow that is... a lot of tequila.
I'm just letting you know now that tequila and I are a wild mix.
Things might get silly.
All right but only if you do a wrap around.
"Go like this,"
I'm not going to let you put your penis n my ass either.
"It's an out hole, not an in hole."
Why are you being such a prude?
I'm not being a prude.
I'm just not a porn star OK!
You wanna announce our lake of sex in front of everybody?
I've just got the wedding on my mind.
Oh what a surprise.
You haven't had any input BTW.
"BTW, Jesus."
It's because I work and I don't sit at home eating chips and dip and obsess over the wedding.
What?
It is disgusting what you are doing.
You're a pig.
I'm a pig?
Hi.
Hi.
Are you guys Ok?
Nobody in this town will pick him up.
Why?
"Well, 'cause everyone in town is here."
Quaint.
I like that.
What?
"Well, that was nice."
What was that for?
You're different from any guy I've ever met.
"When you talk to me, you look in my eyes, and..."
And what?
"When I hear your voice, it sounds really smart, and that makes me feel special."
"Me, too."
"So, any time you're ready to open up, I'm ready to listen."
I blame you.
What?
I blame you.
"I only kept this job to take care of you, you and the..."
"And the, the..."
Kids?
"Yeah, the kids."
I was just a bag boy who didn't have sense enough to leave.
And now that's what I am for the rest of my life.
"Oh, Alan, what you do for a living is only a little of what you are."
It's not mostly what you are.
"Well, then what am I, mostly?"
Mostly...
You are a person that I love a whole lot.
And I want you to be happy.
"Well, right now I am not happy settling for what I am."
What the hell are we looking at?
George...
"Um, I don't think she would."
Why not?
"Well, you see, it's like plants."
There's a time and a season for things to grow and bloom and then they fade and die away.
"Your mother and I have, uh, been through a lot of seasons together."
You mean you just don't like each other.
"No, no, no, no, I don't mean that."
"Well, you don't."
"No, we don't."
Why not?
I'm not the man that she wanted me to be.
And she's not the woman I fell in love with.
We both fell in love with a picture-- in our heads.
Not with each other.
Am I just a picture in your head?
"No, no, no, no."
You're the only thing I love in this world.
I don't want to go.
I know.
[sobs]
Do I have to?
"Well, it'll be a great vacation for you."
"Yeah, who wants to go out west?"
"Oh, what do you mean?"
"Arizona, Death Valley-- all those horses and cowboys and Indians."
"Yeah, bang, bang-- great."
Your mother's got a friend out there.
She told me.
You might like him.
"Well, you might."
"Billy, she's lonely."
She's doing the best she can.
'Cause I'm gonna drop truth bombs.
You know how pissed off I was when U S Weekly said that I was on crack?
That's racist.
I'm not on crack.
I'm straight-up mentally ill.
Sure.
I got mental-health issues.
Sure.
"Well, you know, who doesn't, really?"
"Hey, has anyone seen Liz?"
Or Pete?
She went out.
"Well, who's in charge when they're not here?"
I'm in charge.
Oh.
Okay.
"Um, well, I'm not sure about this costume."
I think it's hot.
Thank you.
"I'm Jenna, by the way."
"Miss Maroney, I got the hemorrhoid cream you wanted."
It's for my face.
"Well, wherever you're putting it, I think it's working."
"You know, I don't think you'd like it, 'cause we work a lot of hours and it's live TV, which is risky."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I like risky."
"See, me and you, we play the game."
We know how to be acceptable.
"""Hello, great meeting."
"I drink coffee, please."""
This show is our chance to break the shackles.
'Cause the white dudes want to see us fail.
What white dudes?
X-ray shows another reason for his condition.
There's a bullet-like metal thing in his brain.
The metal thing is moving.
It's pressing on his nerves.
"If we don't remove it, he'll go into a coma in 3 weeks."
He may even die.
Can't it be removed?
"We want to, but we are not confident."
Sorry.
Thanks.
You're awake.
How are you?
OK.
"What's wrong, Lisa?"
Why didn't you tell me?
What's that thing in your head?
Doctor says if it's not removed... you've only 3 weeks to live.
You tell me now.
It's nothing.
I got shot 3 years ago when on duty.
"I didn't remove it, afraid it'd affect me."
It's been in there since.
I've fainted many times before.
Don't worry.
Only it was longer this time.
I scare of such an unconscious feeling.
I'm afraid to sleep.
Afraid I'll never wake up again.
Lucky you guys were with me this time.
What's wrong?
3 years ago...
Is this reason you stopped courting me?
When my snitches get killed.
Those fuckers give me a giant hard-on.
"Some get laid, others freeze!"
We're on the wrong team.
"No, that's his last fuck."
We'll hump again.
You sure?
Big Luc to Fat Ass.
"Mercedes wagon, local plates, 4 men on board."
It's headed your way.
Long-haired guy is Frank Chenaf.
I nabbed him for a holdup 1 0 years ago.
A mean fucker.
I don't know the others.
Said and Jamel Attia.
I say it's for tomorrow.
Nabbing 'em in the act's dumb.
They'll fire at us.
We may lose them to avoid bloodshed.
What do you suggest?
"We hit 'em at night, and gun down the lot of them."
What about our ethics code?
I've wiped my ass with that for years.
They killed 9 men.
9 families call me every week hoping I'll have good news at last.
I owe it to them.
It obsesses me.
"Stay home, let Vrinks deal with it."
I've worked 2 years on this case.
It's my collar as much as anyone's.
"OK, but you'll be back-up."
You only move in on Vrinks's orders.
"We had California plates, but our car broke down in New Mexico, so we had to get a new car."
"I told you it wouldn't make it, Ray."
But he wouldn't listen to me.
This one will make it.
Make it where?
Philadelphia.
My mother lives there.
She's sick.
"Ray is my boyfriend, so he got stuck with the job of taking me there."
Richard's our friend.
He's just along for the ride.
Uh...
"We weren't speeding or anything, were we?"
"No, ma'am."
What the fuck did you stop us for then?
I want you to get out of the car one at a time.
"You first, ma'am."
Get your hands up.
"Hey, calm down."
"You said ""Get out, you first, man,"" right?"
"Step around to the rear of the car, and keep your hands where I can see them."
"You said ""Get out of the car."" That's all I'm doing."
What's wrong with you?
You told us to get out.
"Ray, do what the man says."
"Stay where you are, ma'am."
Now you put your hands on the car.
Spread them out.
Now spread your legs.
"Okay, same thing."
Hands on the car.
Spread your legs.
"But I'm not referring to you, Moonsook."
You're different from your films.
"Sorry, but you're actually just another Korean man."
What are you sorry about?
"No, I take that back."
My point is you are a Korean man.
"Hey, I'm going back to our room."
I'll be back shortly.
Not coming with me?
That was a hit-by-pitched ball.
Stricter rules will apply to this.
"If you let the ball hit you when you could've dodged it, it's either a ball or a strike."
Like a regular strike or ball.
"Even if you get hit, it may not be a hit-by-pitched ball."
- Doesn't apply to intentional hits.
"- Yes, that's right."
He's in the bathroom.
Want to get some fresh air?
"Yeah, sure."
Wait.
This way.
I don't think we can go any farther.
Shoes are all wet.
- You know what?
- Yes?
"As I get older, I like the west coast."
It's where the sun sets.
And also where the stars rise.
That's right.
Why are you laughing?
Come on.
"Ah, I got a question."
I got knocked up.
So my man proposed to me.
No.
Why did you have to quit too?
I'm pregnant.
He doesn't want me to work.
You can still work even if you're pregnant.
"If I was pregnant, I would still work."
You don't understand.
"I am having a baby, and it will affect the baby."
"If you play that card, there's nothing more to say."
Why are you upset?
I'm not upset.
You told me we would work side by side forever.
Yeah I did say that.
I'm sorry.
But you understand right?
I don't.
You can't do this to me.
Are you really mad?
You have no right to be mad!
Why can't I?
No.
Listen and stop worrying.
Your jobs won't disappear.
"I'll find a new person to take my place, okay?"
Why so mad?
Because nobody can replace you.
You can find someone better.
But I don't want it.
It's not you.
"For me, there is no Je 2."
Are you angry because I'm here all fine?
Is that why you're mad?
Ok!
You can miss exits.
How can you go that far?
Are you stupid?
Fine you can forget your phone.
But wasn't there a phone booth?
You could have called!
I didn't think I would go that far.
I didn't even know that I didn't have a phone.
Did you know that I was waiting for you?
"No, I don't."
Excuse me!
Who are you?
I said I'm sorry.
"I'm really sorry, I want to die ok?"
Why are you so angry?
Is this worth it?
Did I do it on purpose?
"You even missed planes, did you forget?"
-It's twice now.
-Three times!
-Were you counting?
-I was never late!
Because it's always on your schedule.
You don't even care about my schedule.
"Whenever you call and say 10 or 20 minutes, I always had to go even I was on the toilet."
"Even then there could be traffic, or something could be wrong with the car."
You can be late!
But I should be able to call you!
The performance is driving me nuts!
"I let my guard down, fell madly in love, planned a huge wedding, and the guy didn't show up."
"- Wow, that really sucks."
- No kidding.
Must have been so humiliating.
I don't like to dwell on it.
"I mean, just standing up there in your wedding dress... and all those people staring at you?"
"The point is,"
I know a little bit about anger.
And it's not healthy to hold on to it... or to take it out on other people.
Especially someone as sweet as your mum.
It's killing her that she can't connect with you.
"I gotta tell you, whoever that guy was, it was his loss."
Thank you.
Because you must have been so hot back then.
Yes.
Way back then.
Oh.
Here she is now.
Talk to her.
It'll be fine.
I promise.
"Hi, sweetie."
"Listen, um..."
I don't know what to say.
Neither do I.
But we can try.
Really?
Yeah.
So where do you wanna start?
"Well, the fact that dad's engaged to a 25-year-old..."
Or that I think I have a crush on joy... and I'm pretty sure she's feeling it too?
"Oh, wow."
I didn't hear right.
I can't believe what I heard.
This is for you.
I got respect for this kid.
He's got a lot of balls.
Good.
Don't take shit from nobody.
He shoots him in the foot and he tells him to go fuck himself.
"Tommy, you going to let this fucking punk get away with that?"
What's this world coming to?
That's what the fucking world's coming to.
-How's that?
-What is wrong with you?
What is the fucking matter with you?
Are you stupid or what?
I was kidding with you.
Are you a sick maniac?
How do I know if you're kidding?
I'm kidding with you and you fucking shoot the guy?
He's dead.
Good shot. I'm a good shot.
-Hard to miss at this distance.
"-You got a problem with what I did, Anthony?"
His family's all rats.
He would've grown up to be a rat.
Stupid bastard!
I can't believe you.
Now you're going to dig the hole.
I got no fucking lime.
I'll dig the hole. I don't give a fuck.
is it the first hole I dug?
Not the first hole I dug.
We didn't scare him.
What's your name?
"Well, in Germany they call me Johann"
And here Honza.
That's what we call our pig!
"Well, Johann, you can sleep above the pigsty."
- The nights are warm.
- It's him.
Above the pigsty?
Is there no bedroom - er some tiny room?
There isn't.
"All right, I'm used to hardship on my travels."
"Go and turn the hay, up by the wood."
I'll feed Terry and then I'll help you.
"There's a rake, the meadow above the chapel."
He never killed himself working!
"Good, he's here, so we can keep an eye on him."
And we'll pay him back for his trouble.
We'll scare him out of his wits.
"If he doesn't behave, just call us!"
"What are you up to, Honza?"
You're slow!
Would you call me Johann?
You already have a...er - the pig Honza.
"As you like, Johann."
I'm glad I came at the right time.
"You can't do it all alone, poor girl."
I'm not alone - I have my Henry.
What's that?
You wait!
So those palace rascals are still bothering you.
With God's help I'll be home soon to protect you.
"Wait, wait, wait."
I haven't got it turned up enough.
Basil!
I said I suggest...
"Oh, my head, my head!"
Has it come away?
Did you bang your head?
Yes!
Yes!
"Oh, dear."
Let me have a look.
You'd better go and lie down before something else happens.
Shut up!
Why don't you call the police?
"We will, the moment we've searched the rooms."
My money's been taken!
"Yes, yes, I know."
Try not to speak.
Is this a piece of your brain?
£85.
Take my arm.
"I don't need your arm, thank you."
I can get down the stairs perfectly well by myself.
"""Down"" the stairs?"
Don't stop when you get to the basement.
Keep straight on.
Give my regards to the earth's core.
Are you sure you can manage?
"And if you give us any more trouble, I shall visit you in the small hours and put a bat up your nightdress."
"Well, that was fun, wasn't it?"
"The odd moment like that, almost worth staying alive for, isn't it?"
"It's nice to share a moment like that, isn't it?"
' I don't know.
I don't wanna take any chances.
We should get him as soon as possible.
'We'll be there in 24 hours.' I'll pick you up.
- You wanna go to the boat first?
- No.
First show us where he is.
He and his wife own a shirt shop close to Waikiki.
- How about his wife?
"- Yes, she's still alive."
- We may not have time for them both.
- That's OK.
He's our priority.
We're coming up to the shop.
It's busy.
I don't think we can take him here.
Don't linger too long.
He might see us.
"OK, I'll take you to the boat now."
"With those fancy shirts, that outrigger crew of yours had better win."
"Winning ain't important, pop, long as we look good at the luau later."
Typical Hawaiian philosophy.
"To win is important too, you know?"
You and Mrs Greenberg better be there Saturday to cheer us on.
Mama and I will be there.
You just win.
"OK, pops."
- What did you see?
- I don't have to see.
I feel.
- Here. it may be nothing.
- Nothing?
You said you were ready to come back to work.
- I am.
- Let me talk to that prick.
So what's the problem?
"Taylor is playing hardball, he won't budge on the price."
You assured me you could do this.
Do I need to send someone else out there who can make this happen?
"No, I'll get it done."
The clock is ticking.
- I thought you were his favorite.
- Things change.
Let me guess...
"Tall, brown hair."
How did you know?
"When things get stressful, Marcus reverts to his old bad habits."
What does that mean?
His wife.
Tall... brown hair...
"Really quite the beauty, until she wasn't, but I guess we all have our weaknesses, uh?"
- I didn't know he was married.
- Oh yeah.
"A long time ago, it didn't end well."
"Then again, what does?"
I have missed you.
I haven't thought of you once.
Maybe it's time for you to get out.
Maybe it's time for you to shut up!
Close the deal and get out.
"I will, I have to."
"What are you up to, Chase?"
I need change.
What do you mean?
"But the truth is, we don't know how long we have left."
Eric didn't know.
None of us do.
"You can play it safe, or take the chance and fight now."
These are some of the best men I've fought with.
We saw thousands die at Dunkirk.
Our orders were to hold the line to the last man.
And we did.
It was a suicide mission.
I'm not putting these men through that again.
I'm sorry.
I can't let them take that risk.
I asked to be taken to my POW.
Why I am still here?
Damn.
You know what?
I missed lunch.
"So, do you mind if I...?"
If you're done?
Mmm.
Luftwaffe silver clasp.
- Sixty missions to get one of those.
- I know what you want.
Yeah.
Gravy.
Why would I give information to an office boy?
Tell you what.
"I won't pretend to know anything about you, if you don't assume that you know me."
Don't usually flash that on a first date.
You ever been shot before?
No.
It's not much fun.
Not in a good way.
"Said he's a vet, right?"
Afghanistan?
Maybe we crossed paths.
I don't think so.
I wonder what he saw out there that made him like this.
You get to the good part?
You made it a loop.
What do you mean?
Can we unloop it?
The detonator and booster can't be separated from the main charge without triggering the fuse.
Designed it special for hotshots like you...and me.
Anything that's put together can be taken apart.
And we ain't got nothing in common.
We'll see.
- Can you do this?
- Yeah.
He's a punk.
I got this.
All right.
Here's the plan.
"On three, you're stepping off that mine."
Got to do it cleanly.
Then get behind that blast wall.
- I can do that.
"- No, he's gonna need help."
He's been standing here for hours.
His legs are dead.
I don't need you.
"As soon as he's off the plunger,"
I can find the back door to this thing and defuse the mine.
Let's go.
It was my mom's.
Isn't she going to miss it?
She died before I was born.
I don't think that's possible.
"She died exactly when I was born, to the minute."
"Oh, I'm sorry."
You can turn around now.
What's this?
Did some rich guy give it to you?
Is it worth a million bucks?
No.
"Oh, did your mom give it to you, and then she died, and that's all you have to remember her by?"
No.
I stole it.
Oh.
T oo bad it's empty.
T oo bad you don't have a guy to put in your locket.
"A guy with a house, a job, a car, credit cards... and a son."
"Yeah, I know what you're trying to do, and it's not going to work."
"Well, what am I trying to do?"
You want me to go out with your dad.
"No, I don't."
That's good.
I want you to marry my dad.
Let me explain.
I never mix business with pleasure.
I'm not talking about pleasure.
I'm talking about you marrying my dad.
But people like your dad don't marry women like me.
Well...
"I told him what you did, and he didn't mind."
I told the truth.
You might as well.
I'll be grand.
I can always slip downstairs.
"I was so embarrassed, I was scarlet."
"I'm not joking yous, I was burnin'!"
How are yous?
- Go on.
"- How are you, Sharon?"
He was holding the eclair in his hand like this.
"The place was full, and he says..."
"""Why did you rob the cream out of me eclair?"""
"- The head on him, Jesus!"
- And did you rob it?
"Well, I paid for the bleedin' thing."
Why shouldn't I have?
I told him to cop on.
"""I seen ya,"" he says, ""with your finger."""
So I gave him the finger.
I'd shag the elephant man before I'd let him near me again.
The prick.
"Here, young fella!"
"Give us three vodkas, two cokes, and a glass of Furstenberg."
"Have you got that now, chicken?"
"Hey, handsome, give us a packet of crisps as well, will ya?"
And do you have any nuts?
Whoo!
You dirty bitch!
I'm only messing with you.
He's a nice little bum on him... like two eggs in a hankie.
"He'll be nice-looking when he's older, won't he?"
Are you going to break it off with him anyway?
Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.
What the dog do?
Spit gold dust?
He's the best dog you've ever seen.
He could pull that load of yours without any help at all.
- Sure!
I'll bet you he could.
"- Well, he could."
"How'd you like to make a little bet on that, partner?"
Haven't any money to bet.
I hear of one dog in Nome... he pull 800 pound.
But he dies dead to do that.
"Ah, no dog can pull 1,000 pounds."
It's impossible.
"Well, then it's impossible."
Let's drop it.
"Is it all right to look at him, mister?"
It ain't every day we can see a dog that can pull a thousand pounds.
"Come on, boss."
Let's get outta here.
"What's the matter, gentlemen?"
If I overheard correctly... the argument is whether or not this dog can pull a thousand pounds.
I'm willing to bet a dollar a pound he can't.
He won't bet.
Says he's broke.
"I don't want money from you, my friend."
"If your dog is able to do it, I'll give you the $1,000."
- If he can't-
- Well?
"Why, then, I'll take the dog."
No.

Don't come back here again!
How can he be so filthy!
So should you.
I'm going with you to that wharf tomorrow.
Jesus Christ.
They crash our pub.
- They put your brother in the hospital.
- That ain't your problem.
What are you talking about?
I've got just as much at stake as you.
"Matt, listen to me."
It's time to go home.
I don't know where my home is anymore.
I think we both know where it ain't.
"Mate, this is my fight."
It's my brother in the hospital.
I'll take care of Tommy.
"Go home, mate."
I'm forever blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the air
They fly so high
They reach the sky
And like--
"You're doing the right thing, Matt."
Yeah.
"You know that back home, nobody's gonna care about your rep here."
"You know that, right?"
I'm gonna call a cab.
- Where's Matt?
- Finally went home.
Come on.
"This is Charlie-27, MPCP-501, at Brixton Road."
Disturbance...
The cab's on its... ...way.
You seem jittery tonight.
You never know who's coming.
"Ladies, five minutes."
Five minutes.
How'd you do that?
"Work out, plenty of rest."
"You know, eat your green vegetables."
Thas what my mom is always saying.
I just never actually believed her.
Come on.
Go.
Keep it steady.
Is a web.
"Go, Spidey, go!"
We got trouble!
Get me down!
I am more than content with what Mr. Moncrieff said.
His voice alone inspires one with absolute credulity.
Then you think we should forgive them?
Yes.
"I mean, no."
Hey.
Hey.
"Hey, chief."
"You park there, I'm towing it."
Whatever.
Shoelace.
You might want to...
Can I help you?
"Yeah, I've come to see the show."
"Oh, I'm sorry, sir."
No one will be seated after the doors are closed.
When did you return?
Years passed in your waiting.
"Sister-in-law, look who's standing in front of us."
Till now we had seen him just in a photo.
Today we saw him personally.
Who... - We're... - Mr. Jimmy.
"You know inspector Damodar Mathur, right?"
Just shut up!
Talk about Radha.
- No!
Wait!
I'm Damodar's wife.
- Damodar?!
"Oh, sister-in-law!"
"Hello, sister-in-law!"
- Hello!
How's Damodar?
Few months before he wrote me that he... ...is very fine and become fat now.
"You are very naughty, son."
Letters must be sent by Radha... ...and you are talking about Damodar?
"Right, sister-in-law?"
He's trying to fool us.
"This isn't right, son."
You came to India but you didn't inform us.
Radha has gone mad.
- Radha?
"Yes, our Radha!"
- What?
"So, are you surprised seeing your in-laws, Mr. Son-in-law?"
Now let's go home now.
- Home?!
Radha will be happy.
How do I explain to him?
Yes.
"Watch, watch."
"Look, this is you."
And this is Mala
And this is..
And this is me.
Here's your money.
I would prefer dying.. than do this.. with Mala.
Kishen.
Kishen.
"You're trying to ruin my life, Kishen."
Kishen!
If you make Mala fall for you. ..then I will give you 5000 rupees.
I had a wager with my friends that you can make Mala fall for you.
And if that happens then I will win the bet of 10000 rupees.
Jackie!
Jackie!
Jackie!
Jackie!
Jackie!
Let's run away!
"Marriage ceremony is over, Mr. Jackie."
- Hey...
Jackie!
- Yes.
Pasha's letter for you.
"Jackie, I've raised you."
And given you a new life.
But today my life is in danger.
On the statement of retired IG Mr. Shreekant Mathur... ...to the court on 25th September I can get death penalty.
You must stop him from giving his statement to the court.
When daddy has put the incense in here.
[bell rings]
That's it.
"Good morning, mummy. boy speaking native language:"
"Good morning, mummy. man speaking native language:"
"Good, now put the incense out."
Good. boy speaking native language:
All done.
I want some water.
[man speaking native language]
[woman laughs]
[man coughs]
man:
Today we're gonna videotape Sasha doing his first ever shave.
Sasha:
"Oh, boy. man:"
Sasha is how old now?
Sasha:
Uh...15. man:
All right.
Sasha:
15. man:
The first thing Sasha's doing is getting the water hot to put a hot cloth on his face.
Sasha:
Yes. man:
So that it'll warm up your face and moisturize your skin.
"Does he have, like, a nice, warm face now?"
Sasha:
It's always been hot. man:
All right.
Yes.
"Whatever you say there, dude."
What the f did I tell you?
The bandaid on the back of your neck?
The briefcase.
MALE SPEAKER:
No.
MALE SPEAKER:
"Oh, jeez."
Just another day at the office.
-I told you Porno Pictionary was the way to go.
"-Hey, why don't we kick it up a notch and make this into a swingers party?"
"-Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
-I choose Nancy.
-What?
-That little filly.
-What are you talking about?
-For the swingers party.
"I thought we were choosing up, like draft picks."
No?
-No.
"That was a joke, Steve."
BETH HOYT:
"OK, open comments is coming up as soon as I get your questions in for Ted and Julie in the chat."
"First of all, you didn't think we were going to spend half an hour with Ted Leo, and not get him to perform a song for us, did you?"
"What are you playing for us, Ted?"
TED LEO:
"Uh, I'm, I don't need to talk into this, do I?"
BETH HOYT:
Do it for fun.
For effect.
TED LEO:
I am going to play a new song that is yet untitled for now.
"""O baby, sing a song."""
"""Ding a dong!"""
"""O baby, sing a song."""
"""On this evening, on the name of love."""
"""Ding a dong!"" - Ding a dong!"

"""If the matters spoil at it's peak."""
"""The flowers wither."""
"""Sometimes I fear of the separation in future."""

1 1 O'clock.
And that guy must still be snoring in bed.
"Get up, it's morning. . . . ."
"Get up, it's morning."
"You have come, that means it's morning."
Don't recite poetry.
"Get up, you have a meeting at 1 1."
Okay!
What's the time now?
- 12 O'clock.
What!
"For a 1 1 O'clock meeting, you wake me up at 12?"
"Don't worry, one hour late in India is okay."
Nonsense!
Now I know why our India has not progressed.
Why?
If wives like you wake up their husbands like me an hour late. . .
India will never progress.
"God, why doesn't London have such wives?"
Why is she screaming?
- What happened to her?
She was shocked.
- Shocked?
Why?
Look down.
My pajamas got left in the blanket.
- Wear them quickly.
God !
"Go take a bath quickly, the water will go."
Why take a bath everyday?
"It's a waste of time, water, soap."
My complexion won't change even if I take a bath everyday.
"Uh, it's, uh..."
Wait a minute.
[laughs]
A stupid question.
"""What day is it?"""
Ah.
Sorry. woman:
Okay. man:
It's 24 July.
[laughs]
woman:
And what a day it is. man:
It's the best day ever.
woman:
You might be wondering why I'm up at this ungodly hour.
"Like others, I believe that the time between 3:00 A.M. and 4:00 A.M. is one where the veil between this world and the next is the thinnest."
"Often during this time of the day,"
I hear the sound of my name uttered by an unseen presence.
[dog barks]
[rooster crows]
woman:
Good morning.
[woman #2 speaking native language] [woman laughs]
man:
Whoa.
[laughs] [speaking native language] That's nice.
man:
And here we go into the garage.
That's right.
We're going to ride in the elevator.
All right.
Let's ride it.
We found her with her face down in the pillow
Clinging to his picture for dear life
We laid her next to him beneath the willow
While the angels sang a whiskey lullaby
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
Holy shit...
No i met her in a butchery.
Oh yeah totally..
May i help you?
We'll be asking the questions old man
Who are You?
YU!
"No, not me..."
You...
"Yes, I am YU..."
Just answer the damn question!
Who are you?
I have told you!
Are you deaf?
"No, YU is blind..."
"I'm not blind, You blind!"
That is what i just said!
You just said what?
I did not say what i said YU!
And that is what i'm asking you!
- He says he doesn't.
"lf you look at just my feet, I look at least a decade older... probably."
- My feet are really ugly.
- Right.
It's a joke.
None
Yesterday after filming in Las Vegas
I went back to hotel and slept 3 hours.
So I'm kind of tired right now...
But it's a night in Vegas.
The night is young.
I'll get myself together again.
It's my turn now.
It ripped.
None
Does this even show?
This is called reality.
"I have a lot of parts in ""Hurricane""."
It's a fun song.
It's a fun song but we're dressed like this.
So I should act more gentle...
With class!
Shouldn't I do that?
During overseas tour
We always set a goal as a team.
"lf B.A.P ever gets a vacation, Las Vegas is definitely on our list to visit."
It's over.
My eyebrows move too when I sing.
Thank you.
It's over.
I'm done.
Since I was young
Look forward to it!
Bong Joon Gu's first piece of work!
Bong(?) Dumplings!
This is called Bong Dumplings.
Inside the dumpling there is another dumpling.
I made it after getting special permission from your father.
I'm not sure if it turned out well.
I have one for Father too.
Try it and please critique it.
I was waiting so long for you to come home.
Yeah.
"But, what to do?"
I already ate dinner.
Really?
You already ate?
"Ah, what a waste."
Dad.
Oh.
That...
You did quite a good job on the shape.
Does it really look like that?
"Father, try it once."
This is kind of embarrassing and I'm nervous.
Oh.
Joon Gu.
There... um....
We decided to move back into Seung Jo's house.
"It's a bit uncomfortable here, and kind of hard on my back."
And Seung Jo's family wants us too.
We just decided to do it that way.
Just know that.
Okay?
"But strangely when I just look at Hae Ra, my mind goes blank."
Nonsense just comes out of my mouth.
And I wonder if a guy like me looking at Hae Ra is just unfulfilled longing.
Why?
You do have charisma.
I know I have charisma.
But strangely in front of Hae Ra...
"Then, did you confess to Seung Jo?"
I had written a love letter before.
Letter!
"Wow, why didn't I think of that?"
Letter.
"Aigoo, you should never do that!"
Hae Ra is like a girl version of Baek Seung Jo.
"If you write a letter, you'll just embarrass yourself."
Just look directly into her eyes and confess.
Girls like that the best.
I can't even look at her right.
What do you mean look her in the eyes?
Why?
You can practice.
Here.
Just think that I'm Hae Ra.
Should I?
That won't work.
Why?
You can practice.
Just try it again.
How can I imagine you as Hae Ra?
You try.
I'm Baek Seung Jo.
Try it.
I have.
Why?
Then today is tomorrow!
Today cannot be tomorrow.
"Tomorrow will be in the future, and we are in the real time."
And the future is not real?
It...
It is make-believe?
"The future is real, but..."
But?
"But, but, but?"
It will come later.
When?
Soon.
And I think it has already come.
"What do you mean, it has come?"
When?
"What do you mean, it has come?"
"What has come, my friends?"
The future.
Where?
Everywhere.
Today's morning it is already tomorrow.
Really?
It can't be that today is tomorrow.
Yes?
"You mean, today is yesterday?"
Yesterday is over.
"When yesterday ends, starts tomorrow."
Then the day after tomorrow.
Then two days after tomorrow.
Then...
Why do you want to know my bra size?
Huh?
- I never knew Su-eun was so dirty-minded.
- Get away from me!
Happy birthday to you!
"Happy birthday dear Su-eun, Happy birthday to you."
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!
"-Okay, in one shot!"
- One shot!
One shot!
One shot!
Bottoms up!
Bottoms up!
My present?
You want more?
"My present, my birthday present!"
You think I'm still a kid?
These are really popular these days.
Then you wear it.
We spent all day looking for this.
Just keep it.
"Quiet, both of you!"
You're so loud I can't understand anything.
Let me speak too.
What's his problem?
"Sister-in-law, I'll give you a better present than this."
How about a blind date?
Really?
With who?
"Well, in my station, there's..."
"No, No firemen."
Come on!
Cut!
Okay.
Are you Ok?
Is everything alright?
Except for blood on my chest.
"Yeah, right."
It's the winter.
Once the ice stabs the bones he realizes that he's alive.
Nice!
What a line!
"Dad, you're a novelist now?"
"A novelist, that's really off the wall."
Can't recall the things you've done.
"Uh, a truck driver... a cabaret singer..."
You and your samba... a dance instructor... a month at acting school to become an actor...
Remember that?
"Hey, stick to what's going on now."
Dwelling on the past... not a manly thing to do.
"Sir, I came for visit."
"Hi Dal-rae, welcome!"
"Hey, what's up?"
This is Ji-hwan's dad.
"I'm MOON Young-hoon, Ji-hwan's classmate."
"Ah, so you're Young-hoon..."
"Sir, bought some soju and squid for you."
How many?
The fridge is broken so put them in cold water.
Yes.
Do you drink?
"No sir, not really."
You're cringing.
"She comes, and she kneels down every day?"
Moses:
"Yes, because I'm a man."
She has to respect. woman:
It's the culture.
[upbeat music]
[cheers and applause]
man singing:
Wise men say only fools rush in.
But I can't help falling in love with you.
David:
"Hi, Grandma."
It's David.
How are you?
I'm good.
"I'm still-- Yeah, I'm in New York."
"It's--Yeah, it's been really hot here, but I'm having fun."
"Uh, anyway, I wanted to call you, because, uh, you know my friend, uh, Nick, that I-- that you've met a lot..."
Yeah.
"Yeah, I know."
He's a very nice boy.
Uh...
"Well, I wanted to tell you that he's, um, not-- not just my friend."
He's--he's my boyfriend.
"Um, and it's something that I've wanted to tell you for a while, but I wasn't really sure how you would react, so I was a little nervous to tell you."
Um...
I-I love you too.
Yeah.
I love you too.
"And I'm hoping that-- that maybe you can love Nick too, um, because he's really important to me, so I'm hoping he can be really-- really important to you too."
Yeah.
"Well, that-- that means a lot to me."
"Not for your complexion, but you stink."
Go quickly!
Prepare my breakfast.
- I am.
"Lado, get my shampoo."
"If I give him the whole bottle, he'll finish the whole bottle."
He will keep shampooing himself.
"Whatever he does, his complexion won't change."
Get the shampoo.
- Coming !
"The cat is troubling me here, and the husband troubling me there."
Everyone troubles me.
What all do I manage?
"The water has gone cold, get the shampoo!"
Coming.
Take.
- Coming.
Why do you give me the shampoo in a bowl everyday?
Am I a beggar?
"Take a bath, but not in excess."
- Damn !
What shampoo is this?
It stinks!
"Was this shampoo, or egg?"
I'll benefit only if I serve him.
"Lado, my body is stinking of egg."
Smell me.
An egg shampoo will smell of egg.
Now eat.
Okay.
Will you eat?
Is it good?
Sing it with me.
You know the words.
"No, thanks, man."
You've been singin' that shit all week.
"If you try that at M.S.U. this Saturday, I'll kick your ass."
Our last game is this Saturday.
[ Snickers ]
"Yeah, well, shit."
I've got this lacrosse game.
It's really important.
It's our last game.
"Central almost beat us last time, so this time I really wanna kick their ass."
"But it's gonna be cool, because the game's at State, which means afterwards I'll be able to stop by."
So you can't sing at the competition.
[ Sighing ]
"Heather, I'm sorry."
I totally blew it.
It's okay.
You should... do what makes you happy.
All right.
"Listen, thanks for understanding."
Yeah.
"So, uh, I guess I'll see you later ?"
Mm-hmm.
[ Whistling ]
"Hey, Kevin."
- You seen shit-brick lately ?
- Why ?
What did you do to him ?
Me ?
Nothing.
"See, I'm the one whose ass he kicked."
Choose.
Jackie Chan or Taekwondo.
I can do both well!
Fine.
Ten more laps then.
Master!
Said you gotta do both.
A National is only two weeks away and you're 3 kg over.
Pick up the speed!
Another weight loss?
Don't get me started.
Go get me some water.
Ji-hwan...
"You're losing weight to avoid facing Young-hoon, right?"
Think what you like.
"As I told you before, my goal is not winning a Gold but to graduate."
He will only bring her back.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
So what have you decided?
I will bring her.
Not because I love her but since I need money.
Money?!
Money is not a problem.
Tell me how much you want.
I will ask after I get her back.
Gave me one cigarette.
"Sir, cigarette."
"Hey, why are you thundering like that?"
Could you not remember me all these days?
"Anyway, now that you came, stay here for some time."
The both of us can play together.
Ha Ni went to school already.
We know.
We just thought about So Pal Bok Noodles all of a sudden.
Seafood noodles?
With a lot of fresh raw oyster.
"I got it, i got it!"
Over here!
Two seafood noodles with a lot of fresh raw oyster.
Ooh!
Bong Joon Gu!
Sounds like it's your territory.
"Super charismatic, huh?"
"Right, huh?"
Should I buy Ha Ni a pair of glasses?
"Everyone else says I have charisma, but Ha Ni is the only one that doesn't see it."
"Joon Gu, if you're too pushy, Ha Ni will just get bored."
What...what did you say?
"Bong Joon Gu, you really don't know women."
Do you know why Ha Ni can't stand up against Seung Jo?
Because Seung Jo is cold.
What?
Cold?
"To women, if a man is far away, they want to get closer."
"If they come towards us, we want to run away."
Is that true?
Yeah.
"If you keep it up, she'll dislike you more and more, Bong Joon Gu."
"No, no."
Chef kept talking about being sought after!
So I tried it out...
But it does not really fit the personality
"And I can not play, For hard to reach."
"Ah, semi-retired."
"You're trying to get out of taking me to dinner, aren't you?"
Just want to be honest.
No secrets.
Ok.
Then tell me how you survived getting hit by a truck.
Your injuries were fatal.
Was it vampire blood?
"That, and, uh..."
This ring protects me from death at the hands of supernatural beings.
A vampire hunter who can't be killed by vampires.
Convenient.
Are you worried I'm a supernatural being?
One can never be...
Too careful.
"Oh, um, hey, um."
Sorry.
"Oh, uh, I'm gonna go."
"Ok, yeah, sure, sure, sure."
"Elena, I am..."
I'm sorry.
"Please, it... it's ok."
"Ah, it's not ok, Elena."
"I mean, this is not even my place."
It's... it's your place.
It's Jenna's place.
It's your family...
It's your family's place.
"The minute that you slept on that couch, it became your place, too."
"We needed you, and..."
And you stayed.
Sp thank you for that.
"Hey, Gypsy, you can't hold anything but a guitar."
Going to take it into battle with you?
His horse will wield the sword for him.
Ajugful of vodka for me!
"Come on, son."
"Here, hold my hands, guys."
"Hold his hands, come on."
I'll not have you breaking my cups!
"Away, you anti-Christ!"
Vodka!
Quick!
Give me another one!
"Come here, Ksanka."
"Good day to you, Uncle Sidor."
- Do the men bother you?
"- Oh, not at all."
Poor orphan.
I've brought you a present.
- You like it?
- It's lovely.
"- Wear it, if you like it."
- Thanks very much.
Go now.
- Anybody been to see her?
- Not a soul.
- Did she go out?
- No.
"If anything happens, I'll skin you alive."
She makes out to be innocent.
But I know she's connected with them.
They'll show up any day now.
"You see anything suspicious, let me know."
"Banu, see what you did to us."
"Read it, further details in the paper."
- Go on read it.
- Okay Güney.
You thought I could be the murderer.
You accused me in your head.
You didn't believe me.
But see what happened?
The truth has come out.
You accused me for nothing.
Was it worth it?
But you were talking in your sleep.
You said it yourself.
Honey...
"Look, it was only your imagination."
You gotta admit that yourself.
Stop doubting me.
Erase the suspicions in your mind.
"Don't do this to us, if you want us to be like before."
"Please, if you wand to get well, my dear."
I am sorry.
I know I upset you so much.
I am sorry.
"- It's okay, canım."
- I'm sorry for everything.
It's okay.
Okay.
Barış did what is expected from him.
"When he felt cornered, he pulled a victim out of his hat."
- How did you know I'd be here?
- Your assistant told me.
"Melda, we need to talk."
No... not you.
"Okay, I'll hang up now."
This IG seems very loyal to the Law.
It seems we must think of the other scheme.
I've thought of one.
What's that?
You'll disguise goons... ...and I'll become a police officer.
Then?
And we'll kidnap Shreekant's darling daughter Radha.
It seems someone is coming.
Have the goons gone?
Take me out from here.
Please...
Just a minute.
"Sheela, someone is passing."
- Don't make noise.
Move away!
- Stop!
I said move!
- What are you doing?
Leave!
Leave me!
- What are you doing?
I will not spare him!
"- Stop, sir."
"If you'll start firing, there'll be bloodshed here."
Damodar!
Damodar!
"See, what's does."
What's written in this letter?
"Mr. Shreekan, your daughter Radha will remain... ...in my custody, until Pasha is in law's custody."
Remember!
Tha-Tha-Tha-- That would be-- That would be great sometime.
- How about tomorrow ?
"- Well, I have ballet practice."
Perhaps I could come by your house afterwards ?
I could change clothes at your place.
Oh.
Uh... yeah.
I suppose that would be okay.
Sure.
- [ Engine Off ]
- Nice car !
- I'm glad you think so.
- You don't like it ?
"No, I like the car."
"By the way, though, about prom ?"
That was a bad idea.
I'm sorry I invited you.
- What are you talkin' about ?
- Please.
I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.
But you are just a jock.
"No, wait."
You're a jerk.
Wait !
I don't understand.
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
"Heather, I wasn't makin' fun of you."
Gimme a break.
You're so full of it.
Fuck me !
There's gonna be an Eastern European chick naked in your house.
And you're not gonna do anything about that ?
"We need gum, fast."
You can't beat a breathalyzer with gum.
You've been drinking all NlGHT.
Now it's a chase!
BASS
He upgraded the hyperdrive and the stereophonic sound system.
"We outran the space cops, and made them eat bass."
"Yes, I could feel it."
What is he called?
R2D2 your highness.
"Thank you, magic trash can."
You told me there's a bar here.
Yeah my bad.
Panaka.
"Yeah, the pizza's here."
Be right there.
I'm afraid I can't kick in.
I'll have to owe you.
"Whatever, man."
Why do you awaken me without skin?
What of our bargain?
You promised me flesh!
Raw nerves exposed to the world!
Every step is a new nightmare!
All I feel is pain!
You!
Why would they do this to me?
You want me to feel the pain?
"Yes, you want me to understand it."
So that I may show others.
Huzzah!
Excelsior!
- Right.
No.
- It's not a game.
What you want is you want a partner to return the ball.
- Do you want a partner ?
- Yeah.
"Yeah-Yeah, I want a partner."
- You do want a partner ?
"- Oh, I want a partner."
- Want a partner.
Good.
Good.
- Of course.
Good.
"So, once Hal becomes king, he has to take on... the responsibilities of leadership and turn his back... on his old, drunken friend, Falstaff."
"You see, Hal is going through a... rite of passage, much like you all are."
So make most of the time you've got left together.
You'll miss it later.

"- So, does your tongue cramp up ?"
- Nah.
"You get kind of dizzy, though."
- Wow.
That's amazing.
She's probably gonna want to do it soon.

"Still questing after the Holy Grail, huh, guys ?"
"Hey, uh, where's Finch ?"
"- Oh, he went home to take a shit."

I ...wanted to ask ... if your dog was taken ill.
Why should he?
Perhaps an old hurt he always growls.
"Well, no, boy!"
Dick is my friend!
He saved my life!
It happened like this...
That's how dick got written of for the border guard.
"So he is a real hero, that dog!"
"You bet, he is!"
Now I will draw!
- Give back the crayons!
Do you want a candy? - what?
Let's have it!
Here!
Have a treat!
"Watch out Sasha, don't eat it."
It'll turn you into stone!
Why did you bring it here at all?!
"Don't be angry, Valerian I'll bring you some chocolate tomorrow"
And me?
And you?
You'll get an ice cream! ans I'll buy you... a sausage.
"Mitya, have you perhaps seen my tablet somewhere?"
"I did, grandpa, here it is, your magic tablet!"
"Haha, It's not really a magic tablet I was just joking!"
See?
I'm healthy again!
So I don't need medication any more!
"Grandfather, Look!"
Why did he pretend it was only a joke?!?

Ah.. is there anyone here? heeeeeelp!
"I think you got it backwards there, buddy."
The duck is the thing you love.
The rabbit is the thing you hate.
What?
"Yeah, I got to agree."
"Ducks up, rabbits down."
Definitely.
Ducks are better than rabbits.
"I, I get, ducks are, ducks are..."
Rabbits are adorable.
"Ducks are, they're, have you ever been in a fight with a duck?"
"I mean, ducks are jerks."
(offscreen voice) This led to one of the most intense arguments our group has ever had.
Duck is delicious.
Rabbit is all gamey.
"We're not talking about flavor, Ted."
Flavor counts.
Who carries around a duck's foot for good luck?
Anyone?
You wrap yourself in comforter stuffed with rabbit hair.
I'll wrap myself in one stuffed with duck feathers.
Who's cozier?
Oh...
No no no no no no.
But who's cozier?
Hold on.
I have to get another book.
I concede!
You win.
"Honestly, I didn't care."
"This is exactly why I didn't want you in the loop, Elena."
"Yeah, because now you can't do whatever you want."
- Damn it!
- Hey!
Everything all right out here?
Hey.
"Jamie, go back inside, ok?"
Please.
Trust me.
It's better off for you there.
I don't think so.
I'd listen to her.
"Get back upstairs, man."
I said I don't think so.
"Get back upstairs before I tear your damn throat out, do you understand me?"
I don't think you realize how bad you've gotten!
"This is the way it has to be, Elena."
"Oh, yeah, right."
Out-villain the villain.
I get it.
You're not supposed to be here.
"Jamie, what are you doing?"
What I was told.
He's not supposed to be here.
"Elena, he's compelled."
What was that?!
What are you doing here?
"Ah, looking for a bunny."
You're good.
For now.
You still obsessed with Meredith?
A great sage from Dwarka set out for a journey on foot.. ..and that afternoon the sun was really scorching.. ..l gave him a jug of water to drink.
He was so pleased.
And gave me this idol.
And this idol turned my luck around.
"I bought this, once a rented shop.. ..and a three room house in Bhooleshwar."
With terrace.
With terrace.
Amazing!
"Mr. Kanji, sell this idol to me."
I am in big trouble.
I'll rot in hell if I even think of selling my Lord.
Sell the God?
Look at what he's saying.
Mischievous...
Lord.
Listen carefully.
- Yes.
You can hear His flute.
It's time for him to play His flute.
What are you saying?
- Try to hear with devotion.
"Listen, you can hear the echo of Mathura."
"Rajastan, Om Sai Ram."
Heard it?
Can you hear?
"- Yes, yes."
Now leave.
- Sell this idol to me.
"Please, Mr. Kanji."
I'll let this idol out of my sight.. ..only when that special person arrives.
The chosen one.
Who is that?
I finally got a chance...
I should've brought a plain white t-shirt.
Excuse me.
"Excuse me, sir."
Let's start!
I want to hurry up and make something.
My mind and body aren't working together.
I can do this in my head.
None
"I was good a long time ago, really, a long time ago."
I drew very well a long time ago
When I followed friends around tagging graffiti walls
I thought I was pretty good.
I'm not used to this so I keep messing up.
A simple line should be easy to draw. but I can't even do that.
- I'm screwed.
- I'm screwed too.
I tried and tried to fix it.
But I messed up.
Where's yours?
- What picture is this?
- It's supposed to be...
- It should have a meaning.
- This is just a pattern.
The color wore off today.
So I tried another color...
None
I have a dream.
Never give up.
"Neat, huh?"
I'm finished.
My shoes.
We will see him together.
Okay have your seats.
He will be here soon.
Thank you.
"I see you put on a ring, Sami Bey."
"Yes, we did."
- Hayırlı olsun.
"- Amin, to all of us."
It's not much until 13 February.
"Yes, we're almost there."
- Excited?
- I'm too old to get excited like that.
Why do you say that?
You are still young.
You will have many great years together with Sami Amca.
"But still, you shouldn't listen to Cemre's marriage advices."
- Why?
"- I am getting divorced, that's why she's saying that."
"But Zeynepciğim, not even you can break my spirit today."
- I am so sorry.
- Don't be sorry.
"I mean, I am getting rid of my hunchback."
I filed my petition.
Soon it will be over.
- I wish you the best.
"- By the way, no one had forced Cemre to marry..."
I made a big mistake.
Everything is for the humans.
Hello Can Bey.
"Yes, yes, we had sent them to the factory."
"Okay, I'll be there in half an hour."
See you.
Shame on you!
Hello!
I wanted to surprise you.
I went through here and I had to stop by.
- How is your new job and....
- Serdar...
Live me alone.
What?
Look around you.
Everybody is looking at us... me...
Do you know what is being widow here?
"Narin, what are you talking about?"
"I, with my family and child, will have a new life."
Stay away from me.
Don't come anymore.
"When you see me somewhere, go to other side."
"Forget me,"
"So what's the prognosis, Fertile Myrtle?"
Minus or plus?
There it is this little pink plus sign is so unholy.
That ain't no Etch-a-Sketch.
"This is one doodle that can't be undid, homeskillet."
Just tell them.
I'm pregnant.
Who's the father?
It's Paulie Bleeker.
Paulie Bleeker?
I didn't know he had it in him!
"I know, right?"
Did you see that coming?
Yeah.
But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
"I saw the window was open, I thought that maybe..."
Jesus!
I have a request.
I have something to ask you.
A request.
A request?
Just don't ask me to take this off.
I want to paint you.
Your face.
"Don't smile at me, My knees will go weak."
"Oh, wait!"
"I can't explain why I'm doing this, but you are difficult, too."
Just once... don't be so difficult!
Say something.
Say I'm not a thug.
I'll say something.
Those guys there are thugs.
"Hey, I asked you to say something!"
Wait!
"May10, 1995."
He's never a romantic but today after some romantic time suddenly he threw his body on me.
That bastard...
Beast!
Dad?
An unwished-for thing has happened.
That day I got pregnant.
"I got so scared, I ran to him."
"Abort it, he says."
That scoundrel...
Bastard!
I'll raise it.
"Healthy, smart, good-natured."
I don't want to hear anything.
You will have to promise that you will not tell Suraj anything.
Why are you silent?
Promise me that you will not tell Suraj anything.
"All right, Vandana."
I'll do as you say.
I've got it!
This!
What did you get?
Did you find some treasure?
He is screaming as though he has found a treasure.
You'll dance forjoy when you hear the news.
My name and my picture will be in the papers tomorrow.
At least tell us about it.
What is the matter?
"Aunty, read this out to them."
Yes.
With your blessings.
Let me also see it.
- Wait!
"Oh, all right!"
Let her also read it.
"Congratulations, Suraj!"
I am delighted.
My friends have thrown a party and I'd like to take Renu along.
"Yes, of course. ..."
"Go and get ready, my child."
"Go and get ready, my child!"
Which is your favourite colour?
- What!
I mean.
Which colour sari should I wear?
You understand?
Yes...
Let's end this.
That'll be better for both of us.
"Come on, pull yourself together."
Bravo...
Bravo...
You've convinced even me.
- Can you please leave me alone?
- Look...
For years... ...
I worked my ass off to establish this empire.
"I'll strangle you, if I lose it because of you."
I will kill you!
"- Reşat, get out!"
- Shut up!
What are we gonna do now?
Tell me what's gonna happen now?
Soon they'll find Kerim too.
- What are we gonna do when they make Kerim talk?
- Kerim won't say anything.
- He wants to leave the country.
- Come on...
- He was threatening you to confess everything.
- Not anymore.
- We talked with him last night.
He's going abroad.
- So you saw him?
"- You didn't listen to me, is that it?"
- He had called Erdoğan...
God damn Erdoğan!
What did I tell you?
And from that blood I'll write a name... ...outside Shreekant's bungalow.
Radha!
"That's great, mister!"
You lost before fighting a battle?
"No, sir."
I've not defeated.
Ever since my parents have died... ...I've been fighting life since then.
Sometimes with the name Jaikishan and sometimes as Jackie.
"My names kept changing, people kept changing."
But my destiny did not.
"But Mr. Bharat, the life of Jackie... ...is much better than Jaikishan."
Jackie is a goon.
Shreekant called me a goon.
- Mr. Jackie!
He called me a goon!
- Mr. Jackie!
Mr. Jackie!
"- Yes, I'm a goon, Shreekant."
I'm a goon.
"Fine, I don't want your daughter."
What do you think?
Will I come and beg at you?
Mr. Jackie!
- So what if I'm poor and orphan... ...I've lived on my own.
I'm very strong.
- Mr. Jackie.
I'm very strong!
"Jackie, the don!"
"Jackie, the don!"
"Jackie, the don!"
"Jackie, the don!"
Never mind if Radha's wedding cards are distributed... ...but I don't like Jimmy's character.
"Well, here."
What is this?
The monthly rent you paid us while you were living in our home.
This person couldn't bring herself to use it.
Why are you giving this back to me?
You shouldn't do this.
You helped us so much during that time.
I can't accept this.
Here.
"Ki Dong shi, are you really going to be like that?"
"If you don't accept it, I'm going to be mad."
Yes.
Just as your restaurant was getting really popular..
I know that you were going to build a second floor.
"And because of the new house, and Ha Ni..."
I also know that you couldn't do anything.
"But, still... this."
"Ki Dong shi, don't be like that and... just come live with us again?"
Yes?
I came out because of Ha Ni.
This is better for Ha Ni.
Pardon?
For Ha Ni?
How can you not know your daughter's heart?
"Actually, Ha Ni and Seung Jo... you don't know that they're trying to hide something from us do you?"
Pardon?
Hide something?
Those two have even kissed!
And Seung Jo did it first.
Kiss?
Seung Jo did?
Yes.
"Hey, look, I know it's hard."
But Jenna's gone.
And you're allowed to move on.
"Oh, you're still alive?"
I assume that means
Klaus didn't get his coffins.
"Well, don't look so happy."
I was only able to get one of them out in time.
The locked one.
Probably a good choice.
Yeah.
"You know, if you're banking on Bonnie's mama to open it, you're screwed."
She doesn't have any powers.
Ah.
Doesn't surprise me.
It's been that kind of night.
Is Elena ok?
I take it you two had a heart to heart.
And I take it you don't want to talk about it.
Noted.
So why don't we talk about this?
What did you do?
You have your family back.
Finally.
You're going to open them?
Not quite yet.
I still have some unfinished business to take care of.
What business?
"So, Niklaus..."
Elijah?
What did I miss?

Go with Serdar Bey.
"Good evenin, Zilan"
Ohhh. welcome...
"You are coming with full hands, again, I see..."
What can I say?
I am a middle man.
Serdar Bey buys and we carry the stuff.
How are you doing?
Are you okay?
Do you get weary?
"May God thank you, Inci abla, and Serdar Bey."
"If I said my prayers have been accepted, it would be true."
Are all your dreams this?
"A comfortable job, place?"
Enough money.. anything else?
Ali Asker... a person never stops dreaming of more...
"But, we don't have the strength (right) to ask for more than this."
"Nothing is certain, Zilan..."
"You are okay, right?"
Not bad...
"You are saying you are not good, then?"
"You are saying, 'don't even ask.."""
Good night.
Good night.
Didn't I say that you were not go there?
"That if you wanted to see your mother, to go during the day?!"
"And, Serdar is the one to drop you off!"
Why is this doctor still in our life???
Why do you bring this man to our door?
"I didn't want to, I said I could come by myself."
My mother said..
Why don't you listen to me?
Please help us!
Help us!
I don't want to die!
Stop!
"Young Master, why are you here again?"
"It will make things difficult for us, if it's said that such a thing happened on our ship."
Stop this immediately.
I had no intention of throwing them in either.
I just wanted to see someone's reaction.
What a waste.
You missed an interesting spectacle.
That's alright.
Now it's Yongmun?
What if he recognizes Gil Dong?
This is getting complicated.
Still there's not too many of them to fight.
Go Add.
Don't you feel anything?
You've been quiet.
Scared?
"Come on, Add."
Mom.
I miss you.
I want to see you at the cemetery next time.
"Hey, why did you stop?"
Did you see a ghost?
"No, I'll take Dow to her mom's cemetery."
Huh?
You're going to a cemetery?
We've just escaped from one.
And we're going to a ghost city.
Are you crazy?
Hasan! come to your senses!
"What are you doing? shekhar! shekhar! okay, boss! over!"
"Listen! lnform everybody to stop today""s work! okay!"

"lts Tiger singh""s order!"
"Tiger singh""s order?"
Tiger singh has gone mad!
"You are right, sir!"
He commands us because he has money!
I will tackle him!
What will we answer those from whom we have taken gold?
"lf this continues, then we will have to shut down our business!"
And what about my money?
Yes! - shut up!
John!
"- Yes, kaka sir!"
"Tell Jagga to stop only gold fish""s supply today."
"Remember, Pinto!"
Boat number 40 will surely depart! kaka sir! kaka sir!
DDT has taken the gold fish!
Thank you!

What is this?
Will I open a fish shop here?
I had told you to bring gold and not fish!
"Papa, you can""t eat gold!"
You can eat fish!
The rich.
The landowners.
Now they'll be yours.
"Cows, bulls, hens, pigs - all yours."
Give me back my cow!
"You'll have to wait, my dear."
We'll give you everything in time.
You're a free woman.
A citizeness!
Here's where they buried him.
"Next morning the grave was open, the coffin empty."
Since then everyone passing by the graveyard gets in trouble.
- But people do drive past.
- But it's not him...
Didn't Pyotr go at night?
Hear that?
Hear that?
Father!
Look!
THE AVENGERS
Good Lord!
Is it true?
- Honest to God.
- He's talking through his hat.
"I didn't believe it myself at first, then looked around... and saw a coffin flying over the graves."
And beside the road - ghosts with scythes.
And not a sound... not a sound.
Stop!
Stop!
You do better today.
"But when you kick him in the belly, swing your leg harder."
- Got it?
And be quick.
"Ok, boss."
Here the connection is removed.
Let us put it in the girls room.
"Hey Anjanna, put this lantern in the girls room."
"Hey, he is escaping with the girl."
Catch him.
Is everyone safe?
Let us go from here.
We are waiting for a long time now.
We didnt see any train.
I am scared.
Is there any train now?
Why are you scared?
Not for myself.
I am feared about Shailu.
I asked in the enquiry.
"There is only one train, that too goods."
It will not stop in this station.
Still Venkat and Jagan has not came.
How can we leave them?
Venkat told us to leave with Shailu whether he comes or not.
I dont come until Venkat is here.
Here they come.
Venkat!
Is everything all right?
Do you know how scared I am?
When will the train arrive?
There is only one goods now.
Let us somehow try to catch it.
You are not coming with us.
What are you saying?
It's our nation.
"You crack jokes about me, maybe not in public but I'm sure you do when you go home."
[Laughter]
Okay so thank you.
"Do you mind if we don't ask your question Derrick, because we've gone over time."
"So maybe can we.. sorry, no announcements, so the announcement is - there is no announcements tonight!"
[Laughter].
"So if you've got any other questions or you'd like to discuss that matter with me afterwards sir, please come up after the talk is finished."

"Look, I'm telling you the truth."
"You've gotta trust me, Pete."
"Mate, you've put me right fucking in it."
If I don't convince those boys... ...that the head of their firm was not just taken by a fucking Yank journo... ...the GSE is done.
So I'm gonna go out there... ...and I'm gonna tell them that Bov's got it wrong... ...and that you're one of us.
And I had better be fucking right.
"So, Bovver... ...is there anything else you wanna tell us?"
"Listen, Tom, please."
This is how it's gotta go down.
"You're the only one going down, little Bovver."
Grass.
Fuck.
This shit with Bovver could tear this firm apart.
"Mate, I need you."
"Stay with us, just through Millwall."
I'm not gonna help you.
"I made a promise to my wife and kids, all right?"
And I'm sticking to it.
"You know, there comes a time... ...when the best reputation you can have is the one where your family--"

You've changed.
Something's different about you.
You're stronger.
Tougher.
"You're not the only one who changed, Stefan."
We all had to.
That's good to know.
There's something I have to tell you.
And it's not because I feel guilty that it happened.
It's because I feel guilty that you don't know.
I kissed Damon.
There.
All done.
What happened to him?
He was found in the woods.
An actual animal attack.
Bite marks and gashes over half his body.
Lost about 3 liters of blood.
"Well, is he going to make it?"
Nope.
At least not on his own.
What is that?
Exactly what you think it is.
Vampire blood.
You wanted to know my secret?
I cheat.
I'm a doctor and I hate when people die.
"So when I have the ability to do something about it,"
I do.
Stefan...
Say I can't stand being with a guy like him anymore.
But... you want me to say that?
Just help me this once.
I can't say it to him myself.
Mi-ryung asked me to tell you this.
She wants to break up with you.
She can't stand... being with a guy like you any longer.
He's crying.
You can hang up now.
She said you're a really good person.
She hopes you can find someone better.
"Yes, really."
Wait.
Now what?
You said it's finished!
Thank you so much.
-Your nose is bleeding.
-What?
Don't bother.
We're over
Separation Agency
"For people who are hesitant about breaking up, or for those who have trouble saying the words,"
"I will... no, we will do it for you."
Separation Agency.
I wish it would just pour rain and cool things off.
Excuse me?
Is anybody here?
Didn't she come in here just now?
Oh my god!
You nearly gave me a heart attack.
"Damn, why's it so dark?"
Is it on backwards again

That is what is called extra speech.

"My boy, where is the club for playing cards?"
Search!
There is nothing you cannot find by searching.
I did not like your face.
Did I like yours?
Am I not adjusting?
How much did it cost?
- Sixty-eight.
How much?
- Sixty-Eight.
Is it sixty-eight?
I have sixty.
Keep the change.
Ah!
He gave 8 rupees less and asking me to keep the change?!
Ah!
What a son in law!
He is making my daughters shift from place to place.
"He plays cards, has debts every where and has got us a bad name."
Grandmother!
We all know about father.
Leave the matter.
All these days she supported him.
Now you are doing that?
He left us at home with out any care and.. .. now we dont know in which club or .. ..under which tree he is playing cards.
I am here!
I'll scold him!
"Dalyan, I'm sure one of your men will have a knife."

Don't waste time.
I can be thrown in solitary confinement anytime now!!
Dalyan...

"Shoot, but know this Nejdet..."
"I would never betray you, lan."

Who saidI asked you?!
Why are you doing this?
I'm talking to youI failed...
Why are you doing this?
I'm telling you I'm not betraying you!
I will never do it!
There's delay but not denial.
"Just like I came here, to help Kanji bhai."
Help me?
I found out about your condition.. ..only after I brought the house.
"The court case, lost your shop.. ..and your wife and children too."
"Kanji bhai, don't worry."
You can stay here.
"ln return, I will only use your things."
"Television, fridge, etcetera."
"Fine, but remember.. ..one day I will buy this house back from you."
So be it!
"I mean, I promise."
He's a nice man.
- Something you said.
"No, just.."
Cheers.
Calls himself God.
I think he's drunk.
"Thank you, for letting me stay in my own house."
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
I will sleep outside on the terrace.
And you can sleep wherever you want.
It's your house.
Thank you.
Goodnight.

Switch off the lights before you go to sleep.
Another power failure.
No. you switched it off.
"- No, I didn't."
You're drunk.

10 rupees.
Bring this bag also.

Why dont you give it to brother-in-law?
He is already carrying the burden of the family.
You bring it.
- I will bring it.
"Have you understood, uncle?"
They say I am not securing marks and you dont have job.
"Sister, where are you going?"
Those brinjals are fresh.
You wait here.
- Is it necessary?
What happened to these people?
Uncle!
- What is it?
Do you like that girl?
"I have told you about a girl, Do you remember?"
She is the girl.
Who?
That train beauty?
Yes.
Will you do a favor to me please?
Take your parents out from here.
"Ok, I will do that."
Will you buy me a chocolate?
I will give you as many as you want.
Mom!
- What happened?
"Mom, the chips which you kept out for drying.. ..will be spoiled in this rain."
"Sister, Why are you still standing here?"
Ah.
"I mean, don't you have an original vampire to worry about?"
"Ah, ah, ah, do ten more of those."
You're going to want to buff up if you start dating this one.
Self defense and all.
What is your problem?
Your doctor vervained me.
And then she bloodjacked me.
What?
"I mean, when did you even see her?"
When I went to the hospital to accuse her of killing her ex-boyfriend.
"Which, by the way, very sensitive subject."
"Damon, what the hell are you doing, huh?"
Why are you mad at me?
I told you I'd handle this!
I proved your theory...
Diagnosed psycho case.
You're welcome.
Why are you doing this?
Stop moving.
"Jamie, let me go."
"Jamie, he needs help."
- Jamie!
- Bonnie!
Bonnie!
What the...
These chains aren't strong enough.
You need to leave.
Run!
So?
She didn't tell me where the coffins are.
The vampire showed up.
"Hey, I'm busy."
Go and let the students practice.
"Oh Ha Ni, teach him well."
Yes.
"Now, Sunbae, you be the girl."
"Okay, girl."
The head is lifted like this.
"""What are you doing to me?"""
"""Try to forget me if you can"""
"You won't be able to forget it, right?"
I won't be able to forget it.
"Wow, this is really great!"
"Yes, I understand the timing now."
But for the kiss... when I watch movies
Do I turn to the left or right.
Or like spiderman...
Do I do it upside down?
The angle?
"No, I think kissing is about timing."
"Ah, kissing is timing."
Timing...
"Ha Ni, you are very good at kissing."
No.
"Truthfully, I don't really know about it."
What are you talking about?
"If you're at this level, you'll be able to publish a book."
Isn't she hard to understand?
"In the tennis club, the girl who follows Baek Seung Jo around."
You heard about that too?
Is that rumor true?
Yes.
There must be a fun rumor going around.
"- Oh, all right!"
You go first.
- Can I invite boys?
"You haven't got some fancy fellow we don't know about, have you?"
No.
"Honestly, Dad."
"No one says ""fella"" any more."
"This isn't the Middle Ages, you know."
Or the '70s as you call it.
"Sorry, Dad."
I must be hormonal.
Can I have a D. J?
Why would we pay for one when we've already got one in the family?
- What?
"- Oh, yes."
No way.
"Oh, I want music from this century, Dad."
"If we hire a club, we'll get a D.J. thrown in."
We are not going to hire a club.
I can get a very good rate at the community hall.
We've thrown some legendary bashes there.
We still know how to get down.
"Hey, wait, missy."
I haven't told you my news.
"Okay, just please stop snogging."
It's not normal.
- I have been offered a promotion.
"- Oh, cool."
Maybe I can get a PDA instead of a mobile now?
"Georgia, where in the world do you find the most geomagnetic thermal activity?"
"- I don't know, Dad."
- New Zealand.
"I don""t know where the gold is! sardar, you don""t know."
But kaka sir surely knows.
"Am I right, kaka sir?"
"Won""t you serve your country?"
"Mr. Diwan, I can even lay down my life for my country! kaka sir.. where is shekhar?"
"- I don""t know! kaka sir, don""t fool us!"
Where is the culprit?
"I think you don""t know that the government will reward.. ..the person who helps to seize the gold by giving 10% share. kaka sir, constable is right."
We give you 10 minutes to think.
You can think.
We are waiting for you outside.
"Let""s go, Mr. Diwan!"
Listen..
Bhuta singh.. the police is right.
- Then?
This is the golden chance to serve our country.
You are so lucky.
- How?
Go with the police and get shekhar arrested.
And get myself killed! - shut up!
I will give the address.
You can serve your country.
Fine. send Ms. kitty in.
Did you call me?
"No, Ms. kitty."
Your good luck has called you.
- What?
The police are waiting for you outside.
- Police?
The police know that you are hiding here.
"Now I can""t hide you here for long."
There is only one way left for your escape.
We're done.
Great work.
Great work.
"We are B.A.P, great work."
We're finished.
Now I'm going to hurry back and wash up to go to sleep.
I'm not sure if I did well.
But tomorrow will be a better day.
PEACE!
We're done.
See you tomorrow.
Bye bye.
Before we start shooting
I was going to get something cool to drink.
But I ordered some napkins.
- Where is this?
- This is the 21st century.
- There's a soup stain here.
- This is the 'it' item for 21st century.
A boy from 21st century.
Something unbelievable has happened.
Something that should not happen...
We were supposed to film here.
But there's a problem.
So we have to film the next scene first...
So we have to head to the hotel right now.
Let's go to the hotel!
None
"It's huge, there's a pool!"
How many rooms are there?
The water's too hot.
The cost of one night's stay so much.
Even if just for me.
Imagine it wasn't him.
He tried to find out the truth but ran out of time.
"Now he wants me to do something, Malena."
"Pablo, that doesn't make sense."
Know what really doesn't make sense?
Trying to save a dead person's life.
You know what?
They had been locked up for 4 months.
And tortured.
But they managed to escape.
They picked up the girl and ran.
They tried to start a new life.
But that son-of-a-bitch... found them again.
He went after them and killed them.
"Pablo, are you okay?"
"No, I'm not okay."
What did you expect?
How could anyone do something like that?
You know what really gets me?
I don't know anything about them... about what they did before.
"I'd like to know who they were, Malena."
Time's up.
"I'll take the ferry back tomorrow and meet you, okay?"
"Pablo, be careful."
"Stay here, okay?"
Mommy.
Where's my mommy?
It's okay.
Your mommy's okay.
Stay here.
Don't move.
"Okay, I'll get the ham rolls."
But do me a favour.
Don't get up to mischief.
When have we ever got up to mischief?
"Okay, Rex."
See the sun?
"The first one there gets two ham rolls, okay?"
Thank you.
Shall I call a doctor?
No.
I'm all right.
I have to ask you to tell me what happened.
I went to his office to take him some papers.
He locked the door and pounced on me.
He put his hands down the front of my dress.
Then he tried to tear off my clothes.
I was so scared I couldn't even scream.
He must have been drinking again.
I have heard that Mr Fuchs has a drinking problem.
What happened after that?
He grabbed me and I finally managed to scream.
"When I heard Ricarda, I went into his office and saw he'd got hold of her."
I'm going to the police to report him.
Calm down.
We'll deal with this.
- Are you going to ignore it?
- Don't worry.
This will have consequences for Mr Fuchs.
I'll speak to him.
"Ms Limmer, how could you do this to me?"
"Ms Bosch, please..."
"Mr Fuchs, please."
Leave no one behind.
All of us.
Do you feel better now?
Did I seem like I wasn't good before?
Did something happen with you and Madam Noh?
You looked so fierce just now when you were talking about her!
I've never seen you like that.
You looked like a stranger!
Something became very precious to me without me realizing it.
But I thought I had lost it.
So did you lose it?
No.
"Fortunately, I didn't lose it."
That's good.
Then you should reconcile with Madam Noh.
You said she was like a mother to you.
"In my opinion, she cares very much for you."
Yes.
I should go.
You should go now.
I should keep my promise.
"Oh, your name!"
What's your name?
My name is Chang Hui.
Chang Hui?
You can't say it out loud.
You can't say it in front of anyone.
And you can't call me in public.
Can you promise me this?
Then why did you tell me?
Because I wanted you to know what it was.
If I know that you know my name... ...
My father asked me to protect the plants.
My fathers will surely kill me.
There's no need for that.
Because there's something going to happen to you.. ..after which you will die of shame.
What did you say about us on the phone?
Ghost.
Witch.
Today we'll make your plight such that.. ..you won't be able to face the entire neighbourhood.
What do you mean?
I mean..
Kundan.
We mean.. that day we pulled your father's loincloth.. ..and today its your turn.
"No, Kundan."
"Kundan, I would be left with no clothes."
It's okay.
"- Mala, please tell them."
"Kundan, be careful."
Kitchen Kumar is very delicate.
Kishen.
Give me this cloth.
No!
"Mala,"
Where are my roses?
Where are my roses?
The roses were drying.
So I made a paste out of them.
Where's the paste?
I..
I.. it was mother's anniversary.. ..so I fed the paste to mother..
"No, to the bull."
If it was mother's anniversary.. ..then you should've fed the paste to the cow or the bull?
The cow.
I'm not negotiating.
And you understand that holding them indefinitely is the same thing as dropping them in the ocean?
"No, no, you leave Mystic Falls and then give me a call in a few years, and...We'll talk."
I'm going to give you another chance.
Just one more.
Let's make a reasonable deal.
Or what?
"You make one move, and I will..."
"Yes, that's right."
Crazy Stefan.
Mmm.
How's that working out for you?
Any friends left?
I just can't believe I'm actually going to see her.
Or meet her.
Sort of.
Since I don't really remember her.
You don't really talk about her.
What's to say?
"She left, never wrote, never called."
Not even when my grams died.
Can we talk about you and Damon instead?
I'm not talking about it.
He kissed me.
It's not going to happen again.
I mean...
Was it good?
It doesn't matter.
That means it was.
It's Stefan.
I told him I'd call him as soon as I got the address.
Ignore.
Do you think Selim could do such a thing?
- Can't we take a look at that newspaper?
- It's on its way.
What's wrong Perihan Hanım?
What do your in-laws want this early in the morning?
Hello?
My love?
What's the matter?
They say it's Reşat Yaşaran's son.
Who?
Give me a name and I'll strangle him!
They told me last night.
And it's on the newspaper this morning.
"Tell me who said that, and I'll sue that bastard."
"It's on the local newspaper, Münir."
Turaner Bey has just called me.
The news reached even him.
"Yeah, I know."
The girls fiancé has already told me.
- What?
"- He's here, he's gone crazy."
I'm trying to explain it to him.
- Damn it...
- But I'll find that man and make him pay for it.
- God damn it!
- I'm going to the prosecutor right away.
"Yes, of course."
Going to the prosecutor.
Don't get the prosecutor involved.
Don't get us deeper down.
"Don't you worry, I'll take care of it."
"Call you later, uncle."
Wait !
[ Groans ]
"Well, safer than a tube sock."
[ Sighs ]
"- Okay, that-- That was good."
- Yeah.
- See you at dinner.
"- Uh, yeah."
I'll see you at dinner.
"So, Finch, this is your plan ?"
"You know, I don't think girls are into the whole mini-golf thing."
"Kevin, I'm sure that they're not."
"Actually, there is one small matter that I need to ask for your cooperation in."
"- In the spirit of this whole pact, you know ?"
"- Sure, what do you need ?"
"Whatever you hear about me, you agree."
And tell all the boys the same thing.
"Look, I gotta go."
Sixteen minutes round-trip.
"You know, Finch, it's-- it's senior year."
"I mean, don't you think it's time you learned how to take a dump at school ?"
When was the last time you looked at the facilities in this school ?
[ Murmuring ]
- [ Grunts ]
- Excuse me.
"Uh, that's Paul Finch, right ?"
- Yeah.
"- Well, you've seen him in the locker room, right ?"
"- Uh, yeah."
"- So, my friends, they want to know."
Is it true ?
"You know, that he's... equipped."
Go to him.
Shailu!
You are still wasting time here?
Venkat is leaving the city.
- My God!
You are bleeding!
Were already in a lot of trouble.
"- What happened to you, dad?"
"This is nothing, baby."
He was very angry.
Leave that matter.
Venkat is leaving the city.
Go and stop him.
I tried to convince him to change his decision.
But he was very angry.
His anger was increasing every minute.
As a last effort I fell at his feet.
With out respecting my age he kicked me.
I hurt myself by falling on a stone.
I dont care if my body is hurt.
It will be cured in a few days.
But he hurt my heart.
He threw this ring to the ground.
Any way he is a man.
But we have to bare it.
If you go and fell at his sisters feet..
Not necessary.
"Listen to me, baby."
I am saying it is not necessary.
I dont want.. .. to fall at the feet of a person who rejected me.
"If he wants me, he will come to me."
He had a dispute with Bhadram in the past.
She asked me to put her in touch with some juvenile delinquents.
But I am a juvenile delinquents!
She doesn't know that.
"To send her off, I introduced her to Sylvester."
He's most probably the one and only dumb-writed triad member in HongKong.
He's know for his capability to kill.
He's getting a real reputation for that.
Moon!
Moon!
Fuck you!
"How do you do, Mrs. Leung?"
Can I borrow some soya sauce?
Sure.
Come in!
I'll get it for you.
Thank you.
My pleasure.
"Moon, who's she?"
She's from the social welfare department.
A charming lady!
I won't charge you for this.
"Thanks...More, please."
Take the whole bottle.
That's too much.
He visits you often?
Not really.
He used to live in the shop he worked for.
But he lost his job.
That's why he hangs around with me.
He got bullied a lot on the street.
He has to find himself a job.
What and how?
You're driving me crazy.
Really.
Not something forced.
Something natural.
I got it.
I'll try again.
It was gym class.
There were students outside running around...
So we secretly went into the closet.
Pushed a girl onto a mat...
"But suddenly, the students were gathering, outside, the teacher is pounding on the door."
But we couldn't stop.
The girl's voice was getting louder and louder.
And the door was about to open.
But she was reaching orgasm.
I'll have Sam- gae-tang.
You don't even have any money!
Aren't you gonna buy me?
You just watch while I eat!
Don't drool!
You drive me crazy.
Really.
Don't pout.
"Alright, just for today."
You always treat me.
"Next time, bring some money."
You get free sex and now free food!
That's too much.
Sam- gae-tang.
Are you always so quiet?
I like people's voices.
Why are you so attached to talking?
"Hey girl, turn the oven off in five minutes."
Let it settle a bit as I am getting ready.
Then let us make a nice package for it.
"Yes, ma'am."
"Ebru Hanım, we've got a mail for you."
I am so excited to see Kuzey.
"But, also nervous that I will see Sami there."
"I mean, I can't go in before or after Sami."
Since we have limited time.
I will have to see his face.
"I know, he will try to talk to me when he sees me alone."
"But, I will not listen to him."
Why would I listen?
"God forbid, I don't want to give him any hopes."
"If he gets some hope and throws his ring away,"
I would feel sorry for the woman.
Ebru Hanım?
"- Who received the mails today, Hasan?"
"- I did, ma'am."
- Who brought the big yellow envelope?
"- A courier, ma'am."
"Barış, get up!"
Barış get up!
"I'm telling you to get up, Barış!"
"What did you do, huh?"
What did you do?
What's going on?
"Calm down, what did I do?"
Celebrated for the end of Ferhat case.
And getting rid of the Burak problem.
Is this how you want to get rid of him?
- What is the matter?
- Yes.
But I'd still be good at it.
Really?
It's really big!
- Really?
- Yes.
For real.
- Take it out!
- What?
"Your thing, pull it out."
Here?
"Take it out, underneath!"
It's not so big.
"- Yes, it is."
"- No, It's not."
"When it's hard, it's really big."
I don't think so.
"Yes, it is."
It is big.
- Then make it hard.
- Here?
Hey...let's go somewhere else.
Don't make me laugh!
No way...
"That thing, I doubt it can even get hard!"
"No, It gets hard fine."
-What's your major?
- Astrophysics.
You go to a regional college and you think you're going to build spaceships?
"Well, not exactly make spaceships but we study the creation and evolution of the universe."
We also observe and research the cosmic space of the earth's mesosphere and
- planetary movements...

It can never happen.
Must've gotten up really early.
I'm sleep deprived right now.
"But since it's our MV, I'm anticipating a good outcome."
And it's really fun.
I'll be sure to enjoy it.
Peace.
"Right now, we're in NY to film MV. on some bridge."
I don't know where this is though...
Him Chan is already shooting first for the MV on this bridge now.
This is my background scene.
It's awesome.
our solo shoots are over.
We'll film a lip sync all together as a group.
Lip sync like an image cut.
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.
Step back a little...yes.
A chatting scene.
Cut.
What's wrong with us?
"Now, what you do with this coffee is,"
Drink it in a sentimental way.
"Put it down, and pet it once like this."
And try touching the coffee cup here.
This one here?
"You know, something like this."
Put your coffee cup to...
"- You know what I mean? - oh, this one?"
"- No, no."
- Then this one?
Then touch that cup in front of you.
You're thinking of the girl that's supposed to be with you.
Harry sent me roses.
"So where you been, pal?"
You don't return my calls.
I've been busy.
Taking pictures of Spider-Man?
How's the bug these days?
"The less you see of that man, the better."
"Now, les all go into the other room and have something to eat."
I'll get the hors d'oeuvres.
So how are things going at Oscorp?
They're great.
I'm head of Special Projects.
We're about to make a breakthrough on fusion.
"How lovely, Harry."
"Your father would be so proud, rest his soul."
Thank you.
"We're actually funding one of your idols, Pete."
Otto Octavius.
I'm writing a paper on him.
You want to meet him?
You'd introduce me?
You bet.
Octavius is gonna put Oscorp on the map... ...in a way my father never even dreamed of.
"M.J., could you give me a hand?"
"She's waiting for you, pal."
What do you mean?
The way she looks at you or doesn't look at you.
However you want to look at it.
I don't have time for girls right now.
"Why, are you dead?"
I've been kind of busy.
Taking pictures of your friend?
Just wait.
Woman:
Here father.
(Man:
Is it clean?) Woman:
"Yes, of course."
Man:
Then do as I tell you.
Fold the sari into eight folds.
Woman:
"All right, father."
Man:
"And you, you count that she does it right."
(Boy:
"All right, grand-dad.)"
Man:
"One, two, three, four folds we make."
All the germs from the water we take.
Chorus:
"One, two, three, four folds we make."
All the germs from the water we take.
"Five, six, seven, eight folds we make."
Our drinking water safe we make.
"Five, six, seven, eight folds we make."
Our drinking water safe we make.
Woman:
"Here, father, your eight-times folded cotton sari."
Man:
So this is the cotton sari.
And through this we will have clean water.
(Applause)
I think it's safe to say that all of us here are deeply concerned about the escalating violence in our daily lives.
What did I?
Didn I tell you not to see him anymore?
But who am I talking to?
God...
God damn both of you!
What if someone saw you together?
Huh?
"Call that ****, tell him to come here immediately!"
Right now!
He wants to break up.
"If you let a slander separate you like this, maybe you should break up."
"Really, just end it."
"- He wouldn't do such a thing, mom, would he?"
- Of course he wouldn't.
How can you even think that?
Did I do anything to you?
My memory about that night is so blurry.
I don't remember anything.
- Shut up.
- Believe me that I...
Shut it!
- Fatmagül...
- Don't say my name!
"- I swear, I didn't do anything to you."
- Shut up!
I don't want to hear your voice!
"- I can't do such a thing, I wouldn't."
- Shut up lowlife!
- I am not saying I am not guilty.
- Enough!
- I am guilty because I didn't stop them.
"- Back off, or I swear I'll kill you."
Hey!
Do something.
Build a wall.
Do you know my father?
- Yes we know.
"Hey, Salim!"
He is coming this side.
There is an auto coming behind.
Stop the auto.
Take it and go.
Will the meter work?
It will cost 5 rupees more than the meter.
Ok bye.
Good night.
Did she go?
"- Hello Salim, how are you?"
"Hello, Mr. Ranga Rao!"
Are you fine?
Do we look like thieves who steal rings?
No.
Because we sell the rings before you can steal them.
Did you get your Anarkali?
"Yes sir, by your grace?"
So are you daily going to the movies and parks with her?
Even that happened just now with your grace.
When is the marriage?
That too will depend on your grace.
"That is, should the girls father not agree?"
Why should you worry about the girls father?
I advise you to elope with the girl.
That will fix the father and you will enjoy the thrill.
"Sir, do you know what your greatness is?"
Ok.
Ok.
How are you holding up?
Oh.
I'll be fine.
"I'm not here to get my mom back, I'm just here to get her help."
So I hope you guys are hungry.
"'Cause, uh, food has always been my go-to icebreaker."
You have a really beautiful home.
You're so sweet.
Just like your mom.
You knew my mom?
Miranda was my best friend.
So you had a daughter and a best friend and you still left?
My best friend is why I left.
"15 years ago, a vampire came to town."
"Looking for you, Elena."
Looking for the doppelganger.
"No one could manage to kill him, so I lured him out of town and cast a spell to desiccate him."
Mikael.
He was an original vampire.
It took every ounce of power I had.
Almost killed me.
I recovered.
But my magic didn't.
My powers never came back.
And neither did you.
It wasn't that simple.
It wasn't?
"You cast a spell, put Michael down, then..."
What?
You had to teach Jamie how to drive?
"Cemre, you're back in your old neighborhood."
We'll see each other more often now.
- Don't say words that you will regret.
- Go to hell.
"You're nuts, girl."
I'm telling you.
Bye bye!
What are you doing?
It's so not like you.
Why do you even argue with her?
She does this just to annoy you.
And you swallow her bait.
She says Sami Amca insisted.
It's her who is dying to go there.
"Mom, sometimes I want to jump down her throat."
Let me tell you beforehand.
We can't give you February 14.
We're fully booked that day.
"Oh, what is on 14th of February?"
Valentine's Day.
Everyone wants to marry that day.
That's why.
"Okay then, give us any day that is available."
Not the 5th of the month though.
Kuzey's trial will be on that day.
How about 4th?
"No, let's do it after 5th."
So that Kuzey will be with us as well.
Of course.
13th of February is available.
But since 13 is considered unlucky... ... people don't want to marry on that day.
What is unlucky about 13?
"Don't go this way, go that way."
"Down, down, down, drive on the road."
"Faster! - "" Go...go...go...Govinda. """
That was a narrow escape.
"Now, take me to Brahmanwadi."
"Go straight then take a left, then right and another left."
"And you'll be home, go on."
"You brought me this far, so drop me home as well."
My job's to show the way.. ..it's your job to get to the destination.
Fine.
Keep it.
Thank you so much.
You're so kind.
- Thank you.
"Take care. "" Go...go...go...Govinda. """
Papa!
- Sushila.
ls everything fine?
"Go up and take a look in the house, you'll know."
"Thankfully we survived, otherwise.."
"No, I'll talk to the police."
Don't worry.
They hurled stones and acid bottles in our house.
I don't care lf I die.
But the children.
lf Jigna would've been hit by that acid..
I won't let anything happen to them.
I am their father.
Please.
"So, understand the duties of a father."
Withdraw the case.
- You're a fool.
Move. . . move!
Can't you hear the horns blaring?
Can't you hear so many horns blaring?
Thief?
Where is the thief?
Who died?
- No one died.
"Not thief, I said blare."
Are you deaf?
"You speak loudly, and very fast."
So I don't understand anything.
Your moustache covers your mouth.
Move your lips slowly.
"When I see your lip movement, I'll understand."
I don't understand easily.
God !
- What did you pick?
Show me your hand.
I didn't pick anything.
"You've met me here, don't meet me in heaven."
You live in that building?
Which floor?
The traffic has got jammed because of you.
Look!
Why are so many vehicles parked here?
"So many horns are blaring, can't you hear?"
Are you deaf?
The traffic has got jammed.
Are you blind?
Who called me blind?
Looks like a gang who calls me blind is out.
Who are you calling blind?
Enjoy this short life.
"Cemre, her mommies one and only."
My dear.
"Sweetheart, my fortune."
"Be so happy, I don't want anything else in this world, Cemre."
Be happy with the man you love.
And have joint purpose with him.
But have your own purpose as well.
"And have a beautiful girl, like I do."
What if it's a boy?
"A child is a child, canım."
"Boy or girl, doesn't matter."
But have your child from the man you love.
Like I did.
So how did it go?
You saw Kuzey?
Sami Amca gave him the cookies and the letter.
We didn't have a feast like that in a long time.
- Thank you brother.
- Afiyet olsun.
Thanks to everyone who helped bring these to our table.
"Come join us, brother."
Come sit with us.
"Don't feel left out, come on."
"Well, since you are our guest here."
I will accept your invitation.
Let's make the best of your short stay.
"God gave us our punishment, anyway."
"Let us not punish each other, too."
"- Come sit, let us eat böreks of peace."
- Thank you.
- Come sit.
A cheater!
"Today, before Damodar arrives... ...I'll tell you everything true."
What do you want to tell me?
Go on.
"Actually, I'm..."
I'm not your would-be son-in-law.
A charade has been played with you.
And I'm forced to play a role of fraud son-in-law.
"Actually, your would-be son-in-law is someone else."
Who's he?
- Today's race winner.
Jackie!
- No!
You can slap me or kill me.
I'll get the punishment of my deeds.
But this is true.
Mr. Bharat Singh has thrown a big party for Jackie's victory.
And Jackie and Radha are also taking part... ...in a stage program of that party.
And you'll be made a chief guest of that program.
I would like to see this truth.
I'll attend the party.
I'll definitely go.
Has father come here?
Radha!
I don't want you to sing with Kishan in the party.
There'll be a big confusion.
I'll sing.
"- Radha, father has come to known everything."
And no one else other than you could be there behind it.
"No, Radha."
I promise you.
I'm yours only.
What is it?
- I too dont know.
That is what I call extra speech.
I did not like your face.
"Salim, the scooter is not getting started."
Please kick start it.
If he likes someones face he will make..
Why does he have Shailus ring on his finger?
I had a similar ring made for my daughter.
She lost it somewhere.
Did you find it by any chance?
I was joking.
This is a girls ring.
Not good for you.
Your luck will be reversed.
Take it off.
"Oh, is it love!"
You must have that much passion.
But be careful.
If that father knows.. ..he might have your hand or leg removed.
His head will be removed before.. ..he decides between hand or leg.
His Anarkali is my daughter?!
Then why will she agree to become an actress?
She will not.
All of you come here.
Listen all of you.
"If all my debts have to be repaid.. ..and if you have to breath free air, then I must die."
Oh God!
Im coming to you.
How are you?
Bring some water.
What?
"On February the 4th, when the trial is over and you are free."
"I will hug you so tight, that... ... no one will be able to untie us."
Take care until that day.
I love you so much.
I love you so much.
If you want to be my girlfriend then you won't hold a weapon again.
- Zeynep.
- Let us go.
I said let us go.
Do I stick it in here?
We'll leave a row empty.
Then we'll add 4 rows.
Okay.
- Am I doing alright?
- You're doing wonderful.
"""Don't wait for me tonight."
"It's impossible for me come."""
"Now do the turns, and finish the crossed parts."
- How does it look?
"- It looks beautiful, canım."
The idiot dropped it at the house when he was fighting Kuzey.
I forgot that I kept it so that it wouldn't get lost.
Then I found it again in one of the boxes as I moved to my new place.
So I brought it  thought maybe it's something important.
You did well.
This was my father's.
Atilla Sinaner's.
He had bought this specially to give it as a present to Güney.
That fool couldn't hold onto it.
- One more?
"- No, I will go."
- Where?
Let's hope the best for them.
Amin.
"I told them, they shouldn't come all the way back here."
"So, I'll just have what will be delivered to Kuzey."
And I'll take it to them.
Boot licker.
That's good.
You thought well.
"Actually, Sami Amca wanted me to present at the jail as well."
"He said, it would make Kuzey very happy even if I'm just waiting at the door."
"But, I'll see."
Where did Sami Amca say that to you?
In your dream?
"Cemre, what are you talking about?"
Silly girl.
"I got used to it, Gülten Teyze."
This is just a sample of our dialogues with Cemre.
I bet you took a day off from work for this.
"Dear, why don't you go and put the cookies in the oven?"
I got some other stuff to do as well.
You don't worry about me.
"- So give me what you have, and I'll take it to them."
"- No need, I'll do it myself."
"What, are you going too?"
Come on...
"But mom, it's not ready anyway."
What should I do?
- Rush it while Zeynep is poising over me?
"- Well, I can't wait, if it's not ready."
"Also, she might put it into trash or change my letter."
"I won't take the risk, thanks."
"Okay, Cemre..."
Am I not dead?
You may stop me today and tomorrow.
But I will go one day.
No one listens to what I say.
I will listen to you.
Swear by your mother that you will listen to me.
Okay I will listen to you.
Will you become a cinema actress?
"No, no."
You must pose like this.
Are you a director?
You are shooting a photograph like a movie.
My money is hard earned..
Excuse me.
No smoking sir.
I am the father of the heroine.
Even then you cannot smoke sir.
"Let the movie succeed, then I will take care of you."
"Hi, Salim!"
What are you doing here?
I came for Anarkali.
Where is your Anarakali?
Dont play games.
Then give your daughter to me.
I will look after her very well.
I dont even know your name.
My daughter is a star.
She will be a heroine.
She cannot be the lover of a loafer like you.
There is a lot of gap between you and my daughter.
"Hey, you cannot even touch her shadow."
What?
I won't kill when they tell me to... ...or risk my life just bacause that's an orders.
That's sheer dumbness.
The most important thing is to yourself with skills.
That's my style.
You mistake us... we're ordered to collect our money.
Stop bullshitting me!
Where're you from?
We're from the Bank of Canton.
last time because I was late... it selling my account in a couple of days.
They were just do their job.
I just lost 2000 bucks to you.
Shut your fucking mouth!
Move!
"We didn't do anything wrong, did we?"
You want us to take off you?
Move!
Move!
Isn't it right?
Serve them right!
"Come on, go back to your room."
Serve them right!
Wait a second!
Who are you?
Mr.Wing sent me to collect his money.
What money?
Take a look at this!
Have you finished?
You think it's fake.
Just wanna make sure it's not.
"What's wrong with you, Sylvester?"
I know what's on your mind sex maniacal
What do you mean?
Bye.
Excuse me...
My brother?
- What's the matter?
- Where is he?
Tell me what's wrong.
I talked to the doctor and he told me everything was okay and he was stable in a coma.
Was his condition serious?
I haven't been told anything about a transfer.
"Shit, Malena."
- What's the matter?
- Son-of-a-bitch!
You son-of-a-bitch.
What is it?
I feel fucking fine.
What day is it today?
September 10.
"2001, right?"
"I mean I didn't sleep til 2007 or anything, did l?"
You were out for 2 weeks.
You know what?
I have a feeling things are going to get better from now on.
"Shit, this is the 21st century."
We can learn from what we did wrong in the 20th.
"Starting tomorrow, the world will be a better place."
Trust me and you'll see.
"Pablo, there's something I haven't told you that you should know."
THE APPEARED
We are just doing future value of annuities.
"And I'll show you now, why this is such a cool thing."
"And what I'm going to do is, I'm going to do two examples, both for future value of an annuity."
And whats the other thing we do?
- On 18th of February.
Sinaner Holding will make the opening.
We will ring the bell that morning.
- Shall we drink the coffee in my room?
- I need to attend to a meeting.
I need to make a few phone calls.
Then I'll be with you.
See you.
"Güney, don't you dare break Banu's heart."
- What do you mean?
"- Today, I saw you and Melda kissing."
If you want to continue your existence at home and in the company... ... you need to be careful.
Or you'll have no where to go.
You dodged a life there.
Geçmiş olsun.
Are you okay?
Thank you.
"God forbid, you could have died."
I could have.
"But I didn't, again."
"Pity, you failed again."
What are you talking about?
- Our case isn't closed yet.
- I know it isn't.
I'll talk to you about the photo-montage thing later.
- I will not stop until I expose the truth.
- That's enough.
What are you trying to say?
You know exactly what I am saying.
Don't forget that.
- What photo-montage?
"- Just leave it, he's being ridiculous."
I got a variety dream last night.
In that dream both of us were married.
Surprising!
I too had the same dream.
But first night was with Salman Khan.
I will never get married in this life.
What if I reject?
There are many other girls in the city.
If I am not agreeable to the below average beauty like you.. ..how could I expect any girl to like me?
I think I was a wall in my previous life.
That is why.. ..everyone is throwing dung cakes on my face.
"Jagan, come with me."
Where to?
- I will tell you afterwards.
Come with me.
Are you going to hit me there?
What happened?
You should not see.
Remove the hand uncle.
Sorry.
I know you very well.
That is why I said we will sit outside.
Please wait for a while.
We have to select the cards.
We can do that sitting outside also.
I wont do anything.
Come on sit down.
We should not believe this men.
Is this card nice?
No.
Look at this card.
Remove it.
"You don't want us to call the police, do you?"
"Doctor, he's going to kill my brother."
"Calm down, Malena, please."
The doctor isn't pressing charges.
Why not tell me what happened?
My father...
I don't know how he can still be alive...
"Excuse me, but you didn't get my message, did you?"
"After you left, your father's brain activity shot up."
"He's in a coma, of course, but his brain's active."
What?
I'm telling you that we didn't disconnect your father yet.
He's alive!
God!
The son-of-a-bitch...
The son-of-a-bitch!
"Calm down, Malena."
You have to think of your brother.
That's what I'm doing!
Please let me go.
He's going to kill him.
"Pablo, do you understand?"
Please.
Please.
Wait.
What is it now?
How can anyone hate like that?
And hurt another human being without feeling remorse?
What do you mean?
"I'm talking about the torture, the diary... the photographs of you with my father."
Let me go.
I said let me go!
This one here gets shifted up.
Ready to shift some stuff?
"Remember, we only have to do this once."
Right?
So its an upfront cost.
Okay?
It's your investment.
"And then, once you have it, you can have this forever."
"Anybody ever asks you, hey, I need to take with [inaudible] boundary conditions."
"You'd be, like, dang, I gotcha."
"You just take this matrix which you built in 2011 and you can apply it at any time in your life, okay?"
"Show your grandkids,"
Whatever.
All right.
Yes.
[inaudible] where that needs to go in there?
This one here?
Yeah.
Dang it.
"Didn't, did I?"
Where did it put it if you don't put it in there?
That's a good question.
"Let's just put it in, don't ask hard questions."
Alright.
That one's supposed to be there.
"No, no, no."
M minus one.
That's where it's supposed to go.
"I, I think it put it."
"Well, who knows?"
"That's, that's, sorry."
There we go.
How does he know?
Yes.
What you want?
When can we expect the rain?
Not at present.
- Why?
Because the pointing finger was selected.
Tell me correctly.
During the next 48 hours the state will not have any rainfall.
"You can dry clothes, dry chips under the sun etc."
Can we apply beer to the hair?
Do whatever you want and leave me.
Will there be rain at least after 48 hours?
This is a difficult question.
Wait a minute.
Select one finger.
Yes.
"There will be rain after 48 hrs, 6 minutes and 8 seconds."
Is the rain guaranteed?
"Yes, without doubt."
My finger never cheats me.
Since you asked so many foolish questions.. ..can I ask you just one?
- Go ahead.
You are inquiring so much about the rain.. .what seeds did you sow?
He is asking what seeds we sowed?
Tell him that it is the seed of love.
- The seed of love.
What?
The seed of love?!
Put the phone down.
"Hey guys, it will rain after 48 hours."
We all heard that.

You call me from Kashi for a day.. ..and make me travel the entire day.

"Look, Sonakshi Sinha."
"She is Rowdy, my Rathore's in the next alley."
Let's go.
Come on.
"If you hang up, I will resign his job.. .. and become a wayside astrologer."
You are not fit even for that.
O God of rains!
Till today I thought.. .. that only farmers pray to you.
But now even lovers are praying to you.
"Dont you have mercy, O God of rains!"
The moment we hung up there is thunder and lightning.
This means that there will be rain.
Hurray!
It is raining.
"Hey, stop."
She said that she will meet when it rains.. ..but did not tell when and where.
I am getting tense and cannot understand what to do.
It is me who should understand.
Why are you overacting?
Shut your mouth.
I know where to go.
Grandmother!
Did I not tell you?
The rain is here.
Yes I see that.
Leave me.
What is the use of holding my hands?
Go and hold the hands of that boy.
Where will you meet him?
You did not even decide on a place to meet.
I dont understand.
It is me who has to understand.
Not you.
I understood completely.
I will leave now.
Bye.
Keep them under your pillow.
Just eat your fucking breakfast.
"If this happens again, I swear on my mother I'll beat you to hell."
"- It won't happen again, abi."
- Shut up.
Pour the teas.
Fucking idiot.
- Abi.
- What?
I'll wash clothes once the cleaning is done.
- Give me if your clothes need washing.
"- It's okay, young one."
I can paddle my own canoe.
But this is our tradition here.
It's my job.
I am not good with traditions.
Thank you.
Is this why your neck is thick?
Because you do things on your own?
I don't know if my neck is thick.
But my hand is heavy.
"Oo, tough guy."
Leave him be.
- You turned on the oven?
- It's on.
"Did you have to do this, I mean, as if you're racing Sami Bey."
You're making cookies for him.
- His father will be offended.
- It's not the same thing.
I want him to eat something I made with my own hands.
If your cooking improves until Kuzey gets out maybe we should open a pastry for you as well.
He won't be staying for too long in there.
Fire Alarm!
Look at you...
"Now that I'm sick, You seem to study harder and don't get into trouble."
I think I'm getting better because of you.
Really...
"Then Mom, can you come in front of our school?"
School?
Why?
You know how mothers direct traffic by the school.
Can you?
Sure.
I wish I were sick instead of you.
"If you ever say that again, you're not my son."
My baby is sick.
"Please, please let me be sick instead of him."
-Why do you make women cry?
- Huh?
"Oh, you saw it?"
"I didn't make her cry, kiddo."
"By the way, what's with your long face?"
Does your girlfriend want to break up?
"Or, you want to break up, but you're having trouble saying it?"
You're too young to be making that kind of face.
"When you get old, you'll have plenty of chances to be sad."
"Mister, what do you do anyway?"
Me?
"To keep the one I love,"
I make other couples break up.
What's that supposed to mean?
You wouldn't understand...
Here.
"Take this, in case you need it later."
"İnşallah, inşallah."
"I mean, I'm not getting out of your livesafter the lawsuit ends."
I told Meryem Hanım as well.
I see you as my family.
I hope our faces will smileafter the trial as well.
We're just leaving the house.
"No, we'll get there in time.Don't worry."
"Okay, will do, my dear."
"Your enişte is saying hello to you.He's already there, waiting at the airport."
- Take care sweetie.- Have a nice trip.
Thank you.
Bye bye.
Don't pout.You are going away from hell.
- May God be with you.- Have a good trip.
"- There you go, miss."
Your bill.- Thanks.
You're welcome.Have a nice day.
You too.
Doing as I'm told.What else could I do?
"As you said, we delayed the abortion.We'll do it tomorrow."
As if I don't have enough to deal with...
"But I am telling you, Münir.When this is done... ..."
I'll be done with this womanno matter how much money you offer me.
"Okay, okay."
I got it.
When is your trial?
"Okay, call me when it's over though."
You too.
"Who are you?Who are you, God damned man!?"
"- Stop yelling at midnight!- That bastard bought you as well, didn't he?"
God damn it!
You are Münir's man.God damn you!
And I thought... how that was the same body as the one that had... held me so many times before.
And... we didn't say a word.
They took him away again.
I remember I cried because they'd taken away from me the only thing that gave me hope.
"In 1982,"
I came here... to Tierra del Fuego.
I opened this storage room... and I... tried to forget.
"But... the doctors had nothing to do with that, right?"
"Yes, there were... military doctors making calculations."
They... measured the voltage people could take from the cattle prod.
"In other words, they measured the amount of pain a human being could take without the heart stopping."
It isn't here.
Come here.
You're alive!
You're alive!
Let my daughter go!
Let her go!
Let her go or I'll kill you!
I said let her go or I'll kill you!
Put that knife down!
- Put it down!
- Please let her go.
It's okay.
- Please don't take her.
- Where are the others?
Who?.
Please don't take her.
Let's get out of here.
Please don't take her.
"Let her go, you bastard!"
"It's okay, honey."
You'll be okay.
So plus 5.
"5h plus 5, and that is choice C."
"And if you try it out with these points, it should all work."
"OK, next problem."
Let me see.
I think this cutting and pasting works out well.
I think I have time for at least two more.
"OK, let me clear this."
Clear this one right here.
Let me paste it in.
"OK, it says, some ordered pairs for a linear function of x are given in the table below."
It's kind of like the last one.
Which of the following equations was used to generate the table above?
Well we could do the same thing we did the last time.
"We could say OK, this is going to have some relation."
You know y is equal to mx plus b.
It's going to be a line and this is the slope y-intercept form.
And they tell us it's the linear function.
So that's why we can immediately say that's going to be a line.
There's no x squared or anything like that.
So a good place to start is just with the slope.
So slope is equal to change in y over change in x.
So let's see.
"When x goes from 1 to 3, what does y go for."
It goes from 1 to 7.
So change in x is equal to 3 minus 1 or just 2.
And what's change in y?
7 minus 1.
"So that is equal to 6 over-- oh, no."
Sorry.
Change in x was 3 minus 1.
Sorry about that.
- What?
Go with the police and immediately get shekhar arrested.
"No, no!"
"I can""t do this!"
Then be prepared to go to the prison!
"Ms. kitty, there are only two ways in front of you!"
You can choose any one.
Fine.
I will go with the police. very good! very good! shekhar!
I want my share!
- I too want it!
I too want it!
- I too want it! shut up!
"Tiger doesn""t listen to nonsense!"
And he is not a fool that he will hand over.. ..goods worth lakhs and crores to you all! so that you all fight amongst each other!
Everybody will get their goods when the time is right!
When will that time arrive?
I have been after you for 3 years!
"And you don""t listen to me!"
I made a sale of 15 million pound in your diamond!
And in return..
I will never spare you!
I will never spare you!
"Why don""t you give us our share?"
"Remember! lf our boss found out then he won""t spare you!"
And our boss will follow you!
"You don""t know!"
"He doesn""t like deceit!"
He will not spare you!
He will kill you!
Tiger kills people!
And gradually you will find out whom Tiger wants to kill!
She's of use to me.
Come here.
Go catch her.
Go!
Where are you running?
Father.
"Father, are you taking your medicine on time?"
Yes dear.
- How is your chest pain now?
I have only one pain.
My young daughter drives the rickshaw.
And I live off her.
- Why do you think like that?
"Nowadays, girls drive a car, even fly a plane."
I only drive the rickshaw.
"When I was born, hadn't you told mom it's not a girl, but a boy?"
Right?
Sister!
- My Munni is back!
"Leave that, come to your sister."
She is the daughter of the house.
"You are back from school, child?"
Yes.
"But tell me, why did you quit school?"
"When poverty pulled my leg, . . . helplessness took away books from my hand."
"I could not become a doctor, but I'll make you a very big doctor."
"When I become a doctor, I'll first cure father."
"Yes, father will recover."
"Then you, me and father will go on a holiday."
We'll go to a place where there are mountains covered with snow.
We'll climb those.
- But how will I climb a mountain?
- It is a hotel.
Do they serve chicken or mutton?
Only those are available here.
In that case let us go in.
Come on.
Where to?
Listen to me.
How long will it take?
"It will be ready with in 10 minutes, sir."
Do it quickly.
- Ok sir.
Bring one chicken curry and mutton fry for my master.
"Bring boiled eggs along with them, for my master."
Why dont you announce that I also eat fish and crabs?
You forgot to mention prawns.

I hate it when I'm stupid.
What would it do for you to be dumb and stupid?

"Look, I'm just trying to change the world, okay?"
I don't have time for a grudge match with every poser in a parka'.
Besides there's kids in that park so...
Here's one from dead-not-sleeping.
"Long time watcher, first time writing."
Blah blah blah blah.
"""You always say in your blog that you will show her the way,"" show her you're a true villain."
Who is her?
And does she even know that you're...
Laundry day...
See you there.
Under things... tumbelling.
Wanna say...
"""Love your hair"""
Here I go... mumbling.
With my freeze ray I will stop...
The world.
With my freeze ray I will find the time to find the words to...
Tell you how...
How you make... make me feel.
What's the phrase?
Like a fool.
Kinda sick.
Special needs.
Anyways... with my freeze ray I will stop...
The pain.
"It's not a death ray or an ice beam, that's so Johnny Snow."
I just think you need time to know that I'm the guy to make it real.
The feelings you don't dare to feel.
I'll bend the world to our will.
And we'll make time stand still.
"Over here, continue there, continue there."
"So how many one, two, three, four, five."
Nine.
That's what it looks like.
So obvious. . No.
Okay.
"Now notice, what a pain this is."
Just so I can give you more headaches.
"By the way, you only have to build it once."
"We're going to have the code right here, right now."
So it's only you have to build it.
"It's just, we'll have the code right here, right now."
I ask you guys to put ones with an occasional zero down.
And then going to put zeros with an occasional ones down.
And then you're going to put some ones on the corners.
Okay.
"So, kinda problematic, cuz these guys and these guys are painful I got to figure out how to do that vector."
Okay.
"So, we'll do that."
But for right now let's do some easy things.
"Let's put down these ones, these ones, these ones, and these ones."
Notice where they go.
"This starts at n plus 1N,"
Right?
And this is a little N by N block.
"Or, in my notes, I think, that means it's a M by M block."
"It's N by N, these are M by Ns, M by Ms,"
Okay? you know what?
"If you say you said M I'd say no, you didn't hear me right."
You wouldn't know for sure if I said m or n.
They're so close.
I could lie.
Whose car's out front?
That's mine.
I'm Bonnie.
Your daughter.
"Hello, Bonnie."
How do you know this is going to work?
It's a process.
It took decades to train myself to resist compulsion.
The brain's like a muscle.
"The more you use it, the more it can do."
"A sire bond, at its core, is about one thing..."
Gratitude.
"If you believe you owe Klaus your life, ask yourself why."
I was cursed.
"Every full moon, I had to change into a wolf."
It was torture.
Klaus took that away.
Freed you from your pain and you feel indebted to him.
"To break the sire bond, you've to make yourself turn."
"Own your pain, then you'll owe Klaus nothing and you'll be free."
But how can he turn?
It's not a full moon.
He doesn't need one.
"You're a hybrid now, right?"
"I mean, you can turn at will or not, am I right?"
"Yeah, but I don't know how to just...Start."
Now you're making excuses.
You don't understand!
"When I turn, I break every bone in my body."
You asked for my help.
This is the only way.
How badly do you want your freedom?
I wasn't embarrassed.
Now that's when you're mad you're not a phony.
I still resent that.
I'm not a phony when I'm nervous.
Again!
I want to get mad at you!
I...I...you know what -- [mocking]
I...I...I...
I want you on my level so I can pick on you just as much as you're picking on me.
"Okay, pick on me."
I have to wait until you say something that I can pick on.
What does this mean?
Can you develop this movement?
It's a...I can't find words.
I want to...
Develop this.
But since you've been dancing...
I want to start all over again with you.
"Okay, let's start over."
I know a corner I'd like to put you in.
"I'd like to ask you a question and because I have a feeling you don't like me right off the bat, and I want to know if you do."
Can you not play [indiscernible]
What would he say?
"He'd say that she's a phony, for one."
"So, you are a phony."
"You're a phony, and you're a flip little girl, and you're a show off..."
What would [indiscernible] have said to that?
"I know what I'd answer,"
"I'd say, ""I think you are too."""
"Well then, tell this to me."
Tell me what a phony I am.

Shirov won the match with two wins, no losses and seven draws. However the plans for the Kasparov match fell through when funds could not be raised. When Kasparov played Kramnik for the world title in 2000, Shirov maintained that the match was invalid and he was the rightful challenger."

"In May/June 2007 he played in the Candidates Tournament of the FIDE World Chess Championship.

Southern attack.
"The Fifth Army's attack on the Gustav Line began on January 16, 1944, at Monte Cassino. The attack failed to break through. The Germans brought in new troops from Rome."
Battle.
First landings.
"The landings began on January 22, 1944. The Germans did not attack the landings except for a few ""Luftwaffe"" machine gun attacks. By midnight, 36,000 soldiers and 3,200 vehicles had landed on the beaches."
Two Allied divisions landed. There were two or three times that many German defenders.
Response of Axis forces.
"The Germans found out about the landings at 03:00 on January 22. At 05:00 the Germans ordered the ""Kampfgruppe"" of 4th Parachute Division and the Hermann Göring Panzer Division to defend the roads leading from Anzio to the Alban Hills. The Germans had 40,000 troops in defensive positions."
"Three days after the landings, the beach was surrounded by three divisions: The 4th Parachute Division to the west, the 3rd Panzer Grenadier Division to the center, the Hermann Göring Panzer Division to the east."
Von Mackensen's 14th Army took command of the defence on January 25. Parts of eight German divisions were put around the beach. Five more divisions were on their way to the Anzio area.
Allied offensive.
"The arrival of U.S. 45th Infantry Division and U.S. 1st Armored Division, brought Allied forces total on the beach to 69,000 men, 508 guns and 208 tanks by January 29. The total defending Germans had risen to 71,500."

"On February 16 the Germans launched a new attack. Both had 20,000 casualties each since the first landings. Also on February 18 while returning to Anzio the light cruiser was struck by two torpedoes and sunk with a loss of 417 men."
Planning for Operation Diadem.
"Both sides realised that no result could be achieved until the spring. The Germans built a new defence line, the Caesar C line. The Allies planned an attack in May. This would include attacking the Gustav Line, which was called Operation ""Diadem""."
"In March, the 2nd Italian SS ""Vendetta"" Battalion and 29th Italian SS Rifle Battalion were sent to fight against the Allied forces at the Anzio/Nettuno beach. U.S. 34th Infantry Division arrived at Anzio in the same month. In May, U.S. 36th Infantry Division had arrived at Anzio. By late May, there were 150,000 Allied troops."
"There were five German divisions. The Germans had prepared defenses, but they lacked officers."
"The Allied planning for their attack was detailed. British 5th Division and 1st Division were to attack along the coast. The U.S. 45th Infantry, 1st Armored and 3rd Infantry Divisions would attack the German 362nd and 715th Infantry Divisions."
Breakout.
"At 05:45 on May 23, 1944, 1,500 Allied artillery pieces started bombing. Then Allied infantry and armour moved forward. The first day's fighting was hard: 1st Armored Division lost 100 tanks and 3rd Infantry Division had 955 casualties. The Germans 362nd Infantry Division lost 50% of its fighting strength."
"In the afternoon of May 25 Cisterna was captured by the 3rd Division. In the evening, the Allies turned ninety degrees to the left. On the new attack little progress was made until 1st Armored arrived on May 29. On June 2 the Caesar Line broke and the 14th Army pulled back through Rome. Hitler ordered no defence of Rome."
Afterwards.
"After the war, some experts said the Anzio plan was not good. It used just two infantry divisions with no armour."
"""Operation Diadem"" (during which U.S. 5th and British 8th Armies had 44,000 casualties) failed in its goal of destroying the German 10th Army."

Farn-Sasan
"Farn-Sasan was the last king in the Indo-Parthian Kingdom who ruled Sakastan from about 210 to 226. There are no books that talk about him. He is only known because of the coins he issued. He was killed in 226 by the ruler Ardashir I. Because of this, the Indo-Parthian rule ended."
Origin of name.
"Then name ""Sasan"" was popular with the Indo-Parthian people. The origin of the name is not entirely known. David Neil MacKenzie and V.A. Livshits says that the name comes from Old Iranian, translating to *""Sāsāna"" (""defeating enemy""). It is also the name of a Zoroastrian deity."
Biography.
"Farn-Sasan went into the Indo-Parthian throne sometime in 210. They don't know what king was before him. They think it may have been Pacores. Farn-Sasan is not mentioned in any books. He is only known because of his coins. These coins all say ""Farn-Sasan, son of Adur-Sasan, grandson of Tirdat, son of the grandson of Sanabares, the King of Kings."" Farn-Sasan tried to make himself notable by his rule by showing that he was related to his great-grandfather, Sanabares, a famous Indo-Parthian king. He calls the King of Kings Sanabares the King of Kings. Farn-Sasan also called himself the King of Kings. This happened a lot in Achaemenid and Parthian rulers."
Adur-Sasan and Tirdat were never a ruler. This means that Farn-Sasan was probably from a cadet branch in the dynasty.
"On the front side of the coins, he is seen with a cap. On the other side, a fire altar is shown. The altar has writing around it. Farn-Sasan is the only king that is known to have a fire altar on coins that is also from Sakastan. Around the same time, Ardashir I () made coins with a fire-altar that looked like Farn-Sasan's coins. Historians are not sure if Farn-Sasan copied the fire altar or if Ardashir I copied the fire altar off of Farn-Sasan."
"Farn-Sasan and Sasanian Ardashir I share a similar name. Because of this and the fact that both of their coin has a fire altar, historians think Sasanians and Indo-Parthians may have had common ancestry. Historians say that Farn-Sasan and Sasanian Ardashir I were rivals. Both wanted to be the King of Kings. The Iranologist Khodadad Rezakhani argues that Farn-Sasan was a superior of Ardashir I. He said that Ardashir I was only able to say that he was the King of Kings after he defeated Farn-Sasan in 226 and ended Indo-Parthian rule."

Temperament.
"Even though Affenpinschers were bred to hunt mice, they do not like to chase other animals, so they can happily live with other pets. They are playful but very stubborn. These dogs can be difficult to train, because they do not like to listen to instructions and often become bored. Affenpinschers are somewhat territorial (protective) when it comes to their toys and food, so they are not recommended for homes with very small children."
"This dog is mostly quiet, and does not bark much. It can become very excited if attacked, and shows no fear. toward any aggressor."
Health.
"A small study showed that these dogs live an average of 11.4 years, which is not very long for a small dog (small dogs usually live 14–15 years). One of their most common health problems is bladder disease, which happens most often when the dogs are older (8 years and up.) Their short faces can make it difficult for them to breathe and exercise in hot weather. Like many kinds of dogs, Affenpinschers often get a disease called hip dysplasia which makes it difficult for them to run or walk."
Extinct variant.
"The Seidenpinscher (Silky coated Pinscher), was bred from the Affenpinscher and the Maltese (dog) around 1800."

Succession to the British throne
The line of succession to the British throne is the order in which members of the royal family would come to the throne if the reigning king or queen died.
"At present the first in line is William, Prince of Wales and then Prince William's son, Prince George of Wales."
"Traditionally, males came before females in the line of succession. However, the law changed on 26 March 2015, so at present, for people born after 28 October 2011 the succession is decided only by age: older children come before younger children. This system of inheritance is called absolute primogeniture, as opposed to male-preference primogeniture. When someone who is in line to the throne has a child, that child comes after them and their older children, but before anyone else in the line of succession."
Excluded from the line of succession are Catholics and illegitimate children.

Agalychnis callidryas
"Agalychnis callidryas, known as the red-eyed treefrog is a species of tree frogs."
"Red-eyed tree frogs spend most of their time on large tropical leaves. They are not poisonous, and rely on camouflage to protect themselves. During the day, they stay still, cover their blue sides with their back legs, tuck their bright feet under their stomachs, and shut their red eyes. So they look almost completely green, and are well hidden amongst the leaves. The large red eyes are a defensive adaptation called deimatic behaviour. When a red-eyed tree frog detects a predator, it abruptly opens its eyes and stares at the predator. The sudden appearance of the red eyes may startle the predator, giving the frog a chance to flee."
They are active at night. They like to eat small insects.
"During mating, the female carries the male on her back for several hours during the process. The female chooses a leaf above a pond or large puddle on which to lay her clutch of eggs. The male puts out his sperm onto the eggs as they are released."
Tree frogs lay jelly-like eggs. The mothers will stay near them and help them fight any hungry animals that want to eat them. They become a tadpole in one or two weeks. They drop from the leaf and into the lake which is below the leaf.
"If predators are close enough to produce vibration, the embryos sense this. After a few seconds, they vigorously hatch out into tadpoles and spread out to escape."

Wilhelm scream
"The Wilhelm scream is a movie and television sound effect first used in 1951 for the movie ""Distant Drums"". The effect became popular again (its use often becoming an in-joke) after it was used in ""Star Wars"" and many other movies as well as television shows and video games. The scream is often used when someone is shot, falls from a great height, or is thrown from an explosion."
"The sound is named for Private Wilhelm, a character in ""The Charge at Feather River"", a 1953 western in which the character is shot with an arrow. This was believed to be the third movie to use the sound effect. It was the first use of the sound from the Warner Brothers sound library."
History.
"The sound effect comes from a series of sound effects made for the 1951 movie ""Distant Drums"". In a scene from the movie, soldiers are walking through a swamp in the Everglades. One of them is bitten and dragged underwater by an alligator. The scream for that scene was recorded later in one take. The sound was labeled as ""man getting bit by an alligator, and he screams."""
Growing popular.
"The Wilhelm scream began to become popular when Benjamin Burtt Jr. found the original recording (which he found labeled as ""Man being eaten by alligator"") and put it into a scene in """". Burtt is credited with naming the scream after Private Wilhelm (after a soldier in ""The Charge at Feather River"" who was shot by an arrow and screamed). Over the next decade, Burtt began using the effect in other films he worked on. This included most projects with George Lucas or Steven Spielberg. It is used in all of the Indiana Jones movies. Other sound designers picked up on the effect, and use of the sound in movies became a tradition in the community of sound designers."
"Research by Burtt shows that actor and singer Sheb Wooley, best known for his song ""Flying Purple People Eater"" in 1958, is likely to have been the voice actor who first performed the scream. This has been supported by an interview in 2005 with Linda Dotson, Wooley's widow. Burtt discovered records at Warner Brothers from the editor of ""Distant Drums"". These records include a short list of names of actors scheduled to record lines of dialogue for roles in the movie. Wooley played the uncredited role of Private Jessup in ""Distant Drums."" He was one of the few actors used for the recording of more vocal parts for the movie. Wooley performed more sound effects, including the screams for a man being bitten by an alligator. Dotson confirmed that it was Wooley's scream that had been in so many westerns, adding, ""He always used to joke about how he was so great about screaming and dying in films."""
Usage.
"The Wilhelm scream has become a cinematic sound cliché. By 2008 it had been used in many works, including over 216 movies, television shows and video games . Some directors, most notably George Lucas, include it in almost every one of their productions."
"In 2010, a Wilhelm Scream App was released on the Apple iPhone. As of 2011, it is still free to download."
"The second single by British artist James Blake was called ""The Wilhelm Scream"" and was released in 2011."

Irai Leima
Irai Leima () or Ireima () is a goddess in Meitei mythology and religion (Sanamahism) of Ancient Kangleipak (Antique Manipur). She is the goddess and the divine female personification of water and aquatic life. She is also considered to be the incharge of the diseases.
"She is the consort of Irai Ningthou (literally, ""king of water""). Both are regarded as the divine spirits of water bodies."
Mythology.
"Irai Leima is the daughter of King Heibok Ningthou and the princess of Heibok Ching. Her father was an expert in witchcraft and black magic. Irai Leima is known for her exceptional beauty. One day, she was fishing in the Liwa river. King Kwakpa (Kokpa) of Khuman dynasty saw her and fell in love with her. He proposed her. She replied that her parents' wish will be her wish. So, King Kwakpa consulted his subjects. They presented Heibok Ningthou many presents. King Kwakpa planned to marry Irai Leima if her father agreed or to bring her by force if her father rejected. Seeing the arrogance of Kwakpa, Heibok Ningthou turned all the gifts into stone. At this, followers of Kwakpa fled the place. Kwakpa returned home disappointed."
"One day, King Kwakpa got intoxicated after drinking a juice of the roots of Tera plant (""Bambax malabaricum""). He wanted to meet Irai Leima. So, he went to her place riding on a Hiyang boat. Seeing his approach, she fled to Pakhra Ching mountain. Kwakpa chased her. Seeing all these, Heibok Ningthou turned the Hiyang boat into stone and the oar into a tree. Getting angry, Kwakpa ran towards Heibok Ningthou to kill him. Then, Heibok Ningthou turned Khuman Kwakpa into a stone. Irai Leima saw all this and was afraid of her father. She left her father and ran away. She passed the Pakhra Ching, crossed the Liwa river and entered the house of Sarangthem Luwangba. She hid herself inside the granary of the house. When Sarangthem Luwangba and his good lady Thoidingjam Chanu Amurei left the house for field, Irai Leima came out from her hiding place. In the meantime, she completed all the household chores. When the couple returned home, she hid herself again. The couple got surprised at this but it happened everyday. So, one day, the man returned home earlier than usual. He found out the truth. But when he came near Irai Leima, she had disappeared below the granary. He looked under the granary but he saw nothing. He was amazed at this. So, he discussed the issue with all his clan members. They searched everywhere but didn't find her anymore."
"Irai Leima appeared in the dream of Sarangthem Luwangba and told him that she was merged into his clan and became his daughter. The matter was reported to King Senbi Kiyaamba of Ningthouja dynasty. The king sent maibas and maibis to examine the case. The examiners said that the mysterious lady was a goddess and she should be worshipped. King Kiyaamba also told Luwangba to do so. From that year onwards, Irai Leima was worshipped as a goddess."
"The day on which Luwangba first saw Irai Leima was the first Monday of the Meitei lunar month of ""Lamta (Lamda)"". And the day on which the maibas and maibis came was the first Tuesday of ""Lamta (Lamda)"". Still today, from the time of King Senbi Kiyaamba (1467-1508 AD), the Sarangthem family members annually hold a grand feast (""Chaklen Katpa"") in honor of the goddess. Later, Irai Leima came to be known as Hiyangthang Lairembi."
Worship.

It contains 22 of Nat King Cole’s songs, including the song “Unforgettable.” Modern technology made it possible to mix her voice with a recording of her father singing the same song."
Voice of America
"The Voice of America (VOA) is the official broadcasting service of the United States government. It is one of the best-known stations in international broadcasting. Along with English, VOA broadcasts in many other languages. VOA's broadcasts are made to share a positive view of the United States with the world. Americans in the United States are not part of VOA's intended audience, but many Americans do listen to the program."
History.
"VOA was organized in 1942 under the Office of War Information with news programs aimed at Europe and North Africa occupied by Germany. VOA began broadcasting on February 24, 1942, but VOA noted in its site that it began broadcasting on February 1, 1942. Transmitters used by VOA came from shortwave transmitters used by the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) and National Broadcasting Company (NBC). Voice of America began to transmit radio broadcasts into the Soviet Union on February 17, 1947."
"During the Cold War, VOA's budget was reduced. On August 1, 1953, VOA was separated from the Department of State and it was included under the Information Agency. VOA moved its headquarters from New York to Washington, DC. next year. In 1959 VOA started ""Special English"" programs. In the 1980s, VOA also added a television service, as well as special regional programs to Cuba, Radio Marti and TV Marti."
"One of VOA's famous programs was remembered as ""Jazz Hour"" presented by Willis Conover. This program continued for 40 years, and its record remains at the National Museum of American History, also known as """"Smithsonian""."
Languages.
The Voice of America broadcasts in 46 different languages. Television broadcasts are marked with a star:
George Gershwin
"George Gershwin (September 26, 1898; Brooklyn, New York – July 11, 1937; Hollywood, California) was an American composer and a pianist."
Story of his life.
Childhood.
"George Gershwin was born on September 26, 1898, in Brooklyn, New York."
"His family immigrated to the United States. Gershwin, his two brothers and sister had a close, happy family life. George liked playing games on the streets of New York. He liked exploring the city, but he did not like school or studying."
"While exploring the city, Gershwin heard jazz and blues music spilling out of public drinking places. However, he did not become seriously interested in music until he heard another boy playing the violin in a concert at his school. Gershwin began to take piano lessons. His teacher was a fine classical musician. He immediately recognized Gershwin's unusual ability. The teacher wrote about him to a friend: ""I have a student who will make his mark in music, if anybody will. The boy is a genius, without doubt."""
Younger days as a student.
"Gershwin studied classical piano, and he was a first-rate pianist,but his strongest interest continued to be jazz and popular music. He loved playing piano and it was his passion. At the age of fifteen, he left school and went to work in the music business. The New York City street where most music publishers had their offices was called ""Tin Pan Alley."""
"The phonograph and radio had been invented in the late 1800s. But it would be many years before there were musical recordings or regular radio broadcasts. Tin Pan Alley publishers needed another way to sell new songs, so they employed people to play the piano to do this."
"The piano players played the songs all day long to interested singers and other performers. Gershwin was one of the youngest piano players in Tin Pan Alley. Soon, he was considered one of the finest there. He was already writing his own songs. He succeeded in getting one published when he was only 18 years old. It had a long title: ""When You Want 'Em, You Can't Get ‘Em, When You've Got 'Em, You Don't Want 'Em. """
Success as a songwriter.
"Gershwin was now a real composer. The rest of his life was an unbroken record of success. He wrote song after song. His ideas were so endless that he was not even troubled when he once lost some music he had been writing. ""There is plenty more where that came from,"" he said."
"Gershwin had his first big hit in 1919, when he was twenty-one years old. It was a song called ""Swanee."" A popular entertainer, Al Jolson, sang the song. ""Swanee"" was made into one of the first musical recordings. Gershwin was suddenly famous. He also was in the Grammy Hall of Fame."
"Music critics note that ""Swanee"" is not like most of Gershwin's music. Later, he wrote true love songs. Some were light and funny. Some were full of intense feeling. Many of these songs were written for the popular musical theater. One of his most emotional love songs never became part of a musical play, however. It is called ""The Man I love."" The song was sung by the Francine Evans role [played by Liza Minnelli in Martin Scorsese's film, New York, New York] and supposedly 'written' by her character for her soon to be husband, Jimmy Doyle [superbly played by Robert De Niro], of the Jimmy Doyle Orchestra. His character also 'wrote' the title song, New York, New York, who was actually written by Fred Ebb, music by Kanter, his partner. The song became New York's official anthem in 1985."
His brother Ira.
"Gershwin's older brother, Ira, wrote the words to ""The Man I Love"". As George became famous, Ira wrote the words to more and more of his songs."
"The two brothers were very different. Ira, the writer, was quiet and serious. George, the musician, was outgoing—the life of any party. When they had to finish a new musical Ira locked George in a hotel room until it was done. But George wrote better songs with Ira than with anyone else."
Music of Gershwin.
As a songwriter.
"One of many examples of the Gershwin's combined work is the song ""They Can't Take That Away From Me."" The Gershwins wrote the song for dancer and actor Fred Astaire for the film ""Shall We Dance."" That was George and Ira Gershwin's first movie musical."
Azemiopinae
"Azemiopinae, commonly known as the ""Fea's vipers"", is a monotypic subfamily made for a monotypic genus, ""Azemiops"", which contains the venomous viper, Azemiops Feae. It is found on the mountains of Southeast Asia."
Description.
"The Feas's vipers can grow up to the length of 77 cm. They are blueish-gray or black in color with orange crossbands, the head is orange while the chin and throat is yellow, it also has yellow eyes."
Where they live.
"The Fea's viper is found in northern Vietnam, southern China, south-east Myanmar, and south-east Tibet. In China the Fea's viper is found in Fujien, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Kweichow, Sichuan, Yunnan, Zhejiang."
Habitat.
The Fea's viper is found on mountains which have an altitude of 1000 meters. It prefers to live in cool climates which have an average temperature of 18-25 °C. In Vietnam it is found in bamboo forests.
Behavior.
"The Fea's viper is said to be nocturnal, but some people say that it crepuscular, and it hibernates in the winter. When disturbed, the Fea's viper flattens its body to make it look wider, and opens its mouth widely to show its fangs, giving its head a triangular shape. It sometimes also vibrates it tail. Fea's vipers are said to eat small mammals."
Parable of the Prodigal Son
"The Parable of the Prodigal Son is one of the parables of Jesus. It is found only in the Gospel of Luke at 15:11-32. The parable is about a son who wastes his share of his father's estate. He loses all his money and gets work feeding pigs—one of the lowest jobs a person can do according to the Jewish religion. He repents and returns to his father's house. He is welcomed and a feast is held. His older, dutiful brother who has worked without reward for his father resents the fuss made over the prodigal son. His father reminds him that all he has is his. He says they should still celebrate the return of the younger boy because he has come back to them. In the Western Catholic church, this parable is usually read on the third Sunday of Lent. In the Eastern Orthodox Church it is read on the ""Sunday of the Prodigal Son"". The parable is the subject of much art, music, literature, and stage works."
"This is the last of three parables about loss and redemption. It follows the Parable of the Lost Sheep and the Parable of the Lost Coin. Jesus tells this parable after the Pharisees and religious leaders accuse him of welcoming and eating with ""sinners."" The father's joy described in the parable reflects divine love, the ""boundless mercy of God,"" and ""God's refusal to limit the measure of his grace."""
Parable of the Mustard Seed
"The Parable of the Mustard Seed is one of the parables of Jesus. It is found in three of the Gospels of the New Testament: Gospel of Matthew (13:31–32), Gospel of Mark (4:30–32), and Gospel of Luke (13:18–19). The differences among the three tellings are minor."
"In Matthew and Luke, this parable is followed by the Parable of the Leaven. The Parable of the Leaven also has a theme about the Kingdom of Heaven growing from small beginnings. A version of the parable also occurs in the non-canonical Gospel of Thomas 20."
"The parable from Matthew reads: ""The Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field; which indeed is smaller than all seeds. But when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches."" The parables from Mark and Luke are similar."
Parable of the Lost Sheep
"The Parable of the Lost Sheep is one of the parables of Jesus. It is found in the Gospel of Matthew at 18:12–14 and the Gospel of Luke at 15:3–7. It also appears in the non-canonical Gospel of Thomas. The parable is one of three that tell of loss and redemption. The others are The Lost Coin and The Prodigal Son. The Lost Sheep tells of a shepherd who leaves his 99 sheep to search for one sheep that is lost. Joel B. Green writes that ""these parables are ... about God, ... their aim is to lay bare the nature of the divine response to the recovery of the lost."" The parable has been depicted often in art."
Brandenburg Gate (Potsdam)
"The Brandenburg Gate () on the ""Luisenplatz"" in Potsdam, should not be confused with the gate of the same name on Berlin's ""Pariser Platz"", it was built in 1770/71 by Carl von Gontard and Georg Christian Unger by order of Frederick II of Prussia. It stands at the western end of ""Brandenburger Straße"", which runs in a straight line up to the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul."
"Previously, from 1733, there was another, simpler gate on the same spot, which resembled a castle gateway. Together with the city wall, a form of toll barrier, and the other gates it was intended to prevent desertion and smuggling."
"Towards the end of the Seven Years' War, Frederick the Great had the old gate demolished and built, in its stead, this new Brandenburg Gate, as a symbol of his victory."
Since the city wall was demolished around 1900 the Brandenburg Gate has been a free-standing structure.

Problem signs.
"Unintentional weight loss is when a person loses weight without trying. It can be a symptom of some types of cancer. Stress can cause unintentional weight loss. Stress can come from divorce, changing jobs or over the loss of a loved one. Once the stress is removed and the person feels happier again, the weight may return to normal. Depression may also cause weight loss. Eating disorders such as anorexia or bulimia can cause significant weight loss. These disorders usually require the help of health care professionals."
Sleeping.
"Getting enough sleep helps to avoid gaining excess weight. Over time, getting more sleep can help a person to lose weight. The main reason is not getting enough sleep leaves a person tired during the day and prone to eating more food. Getting enough sleep helps in maintaining healthy eating habits."
With every breath.
"Without going to the bathroom, a person naturally loses over while they sleep at night. One reason is humans breathe in oxygen but breathes out carbon dioxide. That is breathing in one molecule of Oxygen for every two molecules of carbon each time they breathe out. A molecule of carbon does not weigh much by itself, but given that with each breath twenty billion-trillion molecules are expelled, over a 7-8 hour period that adds up to over a pound of carbon. Normal perspiration occurs while sleeping but usually only causes a small amount of water weight loss."
Your body also burns calories while you sleep.
Diet vs exercise.
"It is well known that lean mass (muscle and bone) burn more energy than fat. Even at rest, a body with more muscle tissue will burn more calories."
Exercise alone can be effective in weight loss. Several studies found similar results. The comparison between dieting and exercising found both resulted in weight loss. The conclusion was that using both diet and exercise together was the most effective method of weight loss and in maintaining a healthy body.
Shere Bangla National Stadium
"Sher-e-Bangla Cricket Stadium or Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium (SBNS)' is a cricket stadium in Bangladesh. Some times it is called Mirpur Stadium. It is in Mirpur of Dhaka. It can hold 26.000 people at a time. It was built in 2006. It was named after Sher-e-Bangla A. K. Fazlul Huq ""The tiger of Bangla""."
"The stadium has hosted Bangladesh's first class, test, ODI, twenty20 and women's cricket matches. It also hosted international matches like ICC World Cup, Asia Cup etc."
Facilities.
The ground is a state of the art stadium. It is considered one of the best grounds in the subcontinent. Its most striking and interesting part is its modern drainage. The ground was originally built for football and athletics. For this reason it was built in rectangular shape. But when it was shifted for cricket it was fixed to oval for cricket. The ground was fitted with floodlights on 2009. it is able to host Day/night cricket matches.
First test and ODI.
"he ground hosted its first Test match on 25 May 2007. It was a test match between Bangladesh and India. It hosted it's first ODI on December 8, 2006. The match was played by Bangladesh and Zimbabwe."
2011 Cricket World Cup.
The stadium hosted 4 group matches and 2 quarter finals during the 2011 Cricket World Cup.
"Asia Cup, 2012."
Bangladesh hosted the 12th edition of the Asia Cup. Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium hosted those matches.
Sportsbook
"In the United States of America a sportsbook is a place where a player can bet money on many different sports, for example basketball, golf, football, hockey, baseball, soccer, horse racing, boxing and many more."
"A bet is when a person thinks that a particular team/contestant will win a competition and gives some money. If he wins the bet - he will receive his money back with some monetary prize. If his team/contestant loses, he will not get his money back."
"The Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 allows only Nevada, Oregon, Montana, and Delaware to legally bet on sports."
"There are more Sportbooks that allow betting online or through mobile. With better availability and lower minimum bets, the whole industry is rapidly growing."
Before placing a bet a person should read the terms and conditions of the sportsbook to avoid any problems.
Paid survey
A paid or incentivized survey is a type of survey where person for filling out the details will get some reward.
Harp.
"There are seven pedals on a concert harp. Each pedal can be in a high, middle or low position. The strings of the harp can be thought of like the white notes of a piano, tuned to naturals (C,D,E etc.). Each pedal can change one of the letter-named notes one semitone higher or lower. For example: the pedal on the left changes all the Ds to D flat (if the pedal is in the highest position) or D sharp (in the lowest position). From left to right the pedals operate the Ds, Cs, Bs, Es, Fs, Gs and As."
Timpani.
Pedal timpani are timpani with a pedal which will tighten or loosen the drumhead. This will make the note go up or down in pitch. It is a fairly new invention. Composers in the Classical music period never had pedal timpani. Their timpani always had to be tuned by hand using the taps around the side. Composers like Béla Bartók wrote for pedal timpani.
Harpsichord.
Modern harpsichords often have pedals which change the sound in the same way that stops on an organ change the sound. In earlier harpsichords the sound was more often changed by pushing in or pulling out hand stops.
Alcoholism
Alcoholism is addiction to alcohol. People who have alcoholism are called alcoholics.
"Alcoholism is a disease. It often gets worse over time, and can kill a person. However, alcoholism can be treated."
"Alcohol is the most commonly used drug in the world. Around the world, there are at least 208 million people with alcoholism."
"Alcoholism is a condition with a social stigma. Because of this, alcoholics often feel ashamed of their drinking. They may try to hide their drinking, avoid getting help, or refuse to believe that they are alcoholics, because they are too ashamed."
Diagnosis.
"Being an alcoholic does not mean that a person just drinks a lot of alcohol. It means that they cannot control how much alcohol they drink. No matter how badly they want to, once they take one drink, they cannot stop drinking."
"To be diagnosed with alcoholism, a person has to have three of these symptoms in the past year:"
"There is no medical test, like a blood test, that can say whether a person is an alcoholic. There are some questionnaires (lists of questions) that can help tell whether a person ""may"" be an alcoholic. These questionnaires include the CAGE questionnaire (for adults) and the CRAFFT Screening Test (for teenagers)."
Alcoholism causes many problems.
Problems in the body.
"Alcoholism can cause many health problems. For example, it can cause:"
"If a person drinks too much at one time, they can get alcohol poisoning. This can cause breathing problems, coma, and even death."
"In 2012, alcohol use caused 3.3 million deaths around the world. This means that in 2012, about 3 out of every 50 deaths in the world were caused by alcohol use."
Problems in life.
Alcoholism can also cause many problems in alcoholics' lives. These include:
Alcohol withdrawal.
"If an alcoholic stops drinking suddenly, they can get alcohol withdrawal."
"The most serious form of alcohol withdrawal is delirium tremens (often called ""DTs""). Delirium tremens is a medical emergency. Many people who get the DTs die from them."
This does not mean that alcoholics should not stop drinking. It means that alcoholics should talk to a doctor or go to a hospital before they stop drinking. Doctors can give medications to make sure that a person is safe while they stop drinking.
Epidemiology.
"In 2010, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that there were 208 million people with alcoholism around the world. (This is 4.1% of the world's population over age 15.) In 2001, the WHO estimated that there were about 140 million alcoholics around the world. This means that in the nine years between 2001 and 2010, about 68 million people became alcoholics."
Around the world.
People in developed countries drink the most alcohol.p.4
Alcoholism is more common in some areas than others. Here is a list of all the areas in the world. It is in order from the areas where alcoholism is most common to the areas where it is least common:p.21
Population.
"The inhabitants of this city are known, in French, as ""Tullistes""."
"With a population of 14,325, Tulle has a population density of inhabitants/km2."
Evolution of the population in Tulle
"Tulle forms, together with other 7 ""communes"", the urban area of Tulle with a population of 21,108 inhabitants (2013) and an area of . This urban area is the centre of the metropolitan area of Tulle, formed by 25 ""communes"", with a population of 30,970 inhabitants (2013) and an area of ."
Administration.
"Tulle is the prefecture of the Corrèze department, the capital of the ""arrondissement"" of Tulle and the administrative centre () of the canton of Tulle."
"It is part of the intercommunality ""Tulle Agglo"" ()."
Twinned and partner towns.
Tulle is twinned with:
English grammar
"English grammar is the grammar of the English language. Grammar is the rules about how to speak and write in a language. English grammar started out based on Old English, which is considered to be a Germanic language. After the Norman French conquered England in 1066, parts of the Latin language were brought to the English language by the Norman French."
Dialect grammar.
"Dialects of English vary not only in pronunciation but in grammar. For example, people who use what is called General American English or BBC English might say, ""I didn't do anything"", while someone who speaks what is called African American Vernacular English might say, ""I didn't do nothing"". London working class version: ""I ain't done nuffink!"" The dialect a person uses is usually decided by where they live."
"Even though the dialects of English use different words or word order, they still have grammar rules. However, when writing in American English, grammar uses the rules of General American English. When people talk about using ""proper English"", they usually mean using the grammar of general British English, as described in standard reference works. The models for ""spoken"" English in Britain are often called Received Pronunciation or BBC English."
Word endings.
"English makes few changes to its word endings. These are called ('suffixes'): plurals and possessives (""John's"") are the most common. English verbs drop most endings except one: I love, you love, they love, but ""she loves"". That final 's' is a remnant of Anglo-Saxon, which had more suffixes. Verbs do have endings which show changes in tense: walked, walking."
Word order.
"Word order is the other big difference. In English, adjectives usually come before the noun. Most Romance languages normally put their adjectives after the nouns. For example, in English, a person may say ""I like fast cars"", but in Spanish, it is ""Me gustan los coches rápidos"" [coches = cars; rápidos = fast]. The order of the words has changed: if just the words, without the grammar, are translated into English, it would mean 'to me they please the cars fast'. This is because Spanish and English have different rules about word order. In German, main verbs often come near the end of sentences, but in English we usually put them between subject and object, as: ""the cat sat on the mat""."
Parts of speech.
"Grammar studies the different parts of language. The parts of language are called ""parts of speech."" The parts of speech are nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections."
Nouns.
"A noun is a word that names something, such as a person, place, thing, or idea. They can be a single thing such as an apple. They can also be plural such as a box of apples. There is a special kind of noun called a proper noun, which is a name. For instance, Johnny Appleseed."
Pronouns.
"Pronouns are words that take the place of nouns. We often use them to avoid repeating the nouns that they refer to. An example is the word ""it."" In the sentence ""I like the ball; it is blue,"" you have to look at what comes before ""it"" to know that ""it"" is talking about the ball. The noun before a pronoun that the pronoun really means is called the antecedent."
There are different types of pronouns in English language. The most important ones are:
Verbs.
"The basic verb form is called the infinitive. The infinitive for existence is ""to be"". A famous example is the speech of Hamlet: to be or not to be?"
Variations of the infinitive create verb tenses.
Adjectives.
"Words that tell you about nouns are called adjectives. When an adjective is used, you learn more about the noun. An example would be the words ""red"" and ""juicy"" in the phrase ""the red apple is juicy."" They do not have any endings. Even if the noun they talk about is plural, they stay the same. You can see this in the sentence ""the red apples are juicy."""
Boyce and Hart
"Boyce and Hart were a musical and songwriting duo, who worked together in the 1960s and 1970s. Tommy Boyce (born Sidney Thomas Boyce in 1939 and died in 1994) and Bobby Hart (born Robert Luke Harshman in 1939) wrote and produced hit records for The Monkees (""Last Train to Clarksville"", ""Valleri""), Jay and the Americans (""Come a Little Bit Closer""), Chubby Checker (""Lazy Elsie Molly""), and for themselves, with ""I Wonder What She's Doing Tonight"" and other songs."
"Their biggest success was with the Monkees, as writers, producers and performers. Many of the early Monkees recordings featured Boyce and Hart's band, the Candy Store Prophets, before the Monkees were even selected from auditions. When the Monkees themselves took charge of their recordings, they still recorded Boyce and Hart's songs, and praised the duo to the public."
"Ten years after the Monkees's heyday, two former members, Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones, teamed up with Boyce and Hart, touring and performing the band's hits. They also issued a new album on Capitol Records."
"Janesville, Wisconsin"
"Janesville is a city in the state of Wisconsin in the United States. It is the county seat of Rock County. 59,498 people were living in Janesville as of the 2000 census. Janesville has an area of 48.1 square miles, says the United States Census Bureau."
The first settlers arrived in Janesville in 1835. It incorporated as a city in 1835
Malcolm Gladwell
"Malcolm Gladwell (born September 3, 1963) is a British-Canadian journalist, author, and pop sociologist, living in New York City. He has written for ""The New Yorker"" since 1996. He is well known as the author of the books, ""The Tipping Point"" (2000), ""Blink"" (2005), and ""Outliers"" (2008)."
"Gladwell was born in Fareham, Hampshire to a Jamaican mother and English father. He moved to Elmira, Ontario at age six."
Rosoideae
"Rosoideae is a subfamily of plants in the rose family Rosaceae. These plants may be small trees, shrubs, or plants without wood. Many useful plants are in Rosoideae. Strawberries and Raspberries are two common fruits from Rosoideae. Roses are common flowers in Rosoideae."
First Leicester
"First Leicester is the trading name of Leicester Citybus Ltd., a bus company owned by the First Group. It runs buses in the city of Leicester England."
Depot.
"In 2007,a new depot opened on Abbey Lane replacing the former premises on Abbey Park Road which go back to the company's municipal heritage. This site is now derelict pending redevelopment as apartments."
Dappy
"Costadinos Contostavlos, better known by his stage name of ""Dappy"", is an English rapper, singer and songwriter of Greek heritage. He leads the hip hop group N-Dubz. Contostavlos was raised on a Camden Town council estate, North London by his mother, Zoe Contostavlos and father, Byron Contostavlos. His father was the bassist in 1970s group Mungo Jerry.Contostavlos is from Greek origin but speaks fluent English with a classic North London accent. He does not think of himself to be ""English in anyway"". At home he speaks Greek. He says he is a ""foreign guy that lives in Camden"". He wears unusual hats. His trademark is a selection of woolly fleece lined hats with big pom-poms on the top and strings on the sides. These have been called ""Dappy hats"". He normally turns up one side of the hat."
Early life and current status.
"Dappy was born in Camden Town, London. It is said that he grew up in a small council flat with his parents and older brother. He actually lived in a large townhouse because his father was a member of 1970s band Mungo Jerry. In an interview he gave to The Sun, he said that the estate he lived on was ""rough and lots of the kids I saw got into drugs or fights"". Dappy showed interest in music from a young age. He started performing around Camden Town at the age of 13 years old. He performed with band members Richard ""Fazer"" Rawson and Tula ""Tulisa"" Contostavlos, who is his cousin. At the time they were called the ""Lickle Rinsers Crew"". Contostavlos and his band-mates studied at Haverstock School. Contostavlos was forced to leave the school when he was 15, for multiple truancies and fighting. He later went back to study at college and received a GCSE A* in English. His father, Byron was, to Dappy, the ""inspiration behind the band"". With the money he made from his time in the band, Bryon set up a small studio for the band. When Byron died, the song N-Dubz wrote ""Papa (Can You Hear Me?)"" was played at his funeral. It became the group's best hit at #19, and at #17 in the download charts. Dappy later had the words ""RIP Dad"" tattooed on his neck. He refers to his dad as ""B"" or ""Uncle B""."
He is a housemate in the 2014 series of Celebrity Big Brother (UK).
Personal life.
"N-Dubz were forced to change some of their live shows from the Uncle B tour after Dappy got temporary deafness. He later said that it ""was terrible and it has really taught me to take better care of my ears because I wouldn't be the musician I am today if I couldn't hear."""
Criticism.
"In 2007 Dappy released ""Love For My Slum"" with fellow UK rap artist Baker Trouble. It was number one on Channel U for several weeks. It did not do as well with the media. It was heavily criticised for a scene in which Dappy is stood outside a block of expensive luxury flats with a ""rich kid"" who is trying to look like a gangster. ""The Independent"" wrote ""His lyrics combine jealousy with anger: 'You got too much to lose / You're in a great position... You wouldn't last a minute where I'm from / You'd go missing / So appreciate what you got / 'cos I'm still wishing.' And then he grabs the rich kid by his coat, pulls him toward him, and punches him in the face. The silent boy falls instantly to the pavement..."", they then went on to put ""Do scenes like these suggest that music videos are encouraging their viewers to indulge in criminality?"". Other newspapers put that he was ""idolising thuggery"". When asked in interviews about the single, and these comments he said ""these people need to listen to the lyrics, they are about showing appreciation to what you've got""."
"In December 2008, Contostavlos pleaded guilty to two counts of assault at Chelmsford Magistrates Court, Essex. He spat in a girl's face while drunk on a night out. He got four weeks' imprisonment, suspended for 12 months and 100 hours community service. He was also ordered to pay £50 to the girl and her friend, and £300 costs."
"Critics of Putin say that he has taken away people's freedoms, and that he has failed to make the country more developed. Russia makes lots of money from selling oil and gas to other countries, but because of corruption, this money is not used for improving living conditions."
"Recently, the Russian opposition has held anti-government rallies, campaigned against Putin on the Internet, and published independent reports for the general public. Because of censorship in the mass media, it's very difficult to get different information out to the public."
Putin was against invading Libya in 2011. He is also against invading Syria and Iran.
"On March 24, 2014, Putin and Russia were suspended from the G8. This was because the United States thought that the Ukraine crisis was Putin's fault."
"According to the Constitution of Russia, no-one can be president three times in a row. Because of this, Putin didn't put himself forward for the March 2008 election. However, you're allowed to be president as many times as you want, as long as it's not for more than two times in a row. In March 2012, Putin put himself forward for the elections, and won 64% of the vote. This means that he was the president of Russia until 2018."
"On December 6, 2017 Russia President Vladimir Putin announced he would run for a fourth term in the upcoming election, 2018 Russian Presidential Election."
"In July 2020, Russian voters backed a referendum that would allow Putin to serve as president until 2036."
"On 24 February 2022, Putin announced that his military was going to invade Ukraine. This happened after a year of tension and military buildup between the two countries. The invasion led to many calling Putin a war criminal and wanting him to be prosecuted as a war criminal."
Personal life.
"He is a member of the Russian Orthodox Church, and is divorced with two daughters."
Henry VII of England
Henry VII or Henry Tudor (28 January 1457–21 April 1509) was King of England from 1485 to 1509. He founded the Tudor dynasty by winning the battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. His son became king Henry VIII of England.
Biography.
"Henry VII was born in 1457 to Edmund Tudor and Margaret Beaufort. His father died two months before he was born, leaving his 13-year-old mother as his only parent. After Henry's birth, he spent a lot of time with his uncle Jasper Tudor. Jasper took Henry to France, where he spent most of his youth. Henry had a claim to the throne of England, but it was not a very good one, and he had to wait a long time for a chance to take the throne."
"In 1483, a new king came to the throne in England, called Richard III. King Richard was not popular with everyone. Some thought he had stolen the throne from his young nephews and had killed them. This gave Henry the chance he had been waiting for. With help from the French, he raised an army. They landed at Dale in Pembrokeshire, close to where Henry had been born, so he was able to gather more supporters on the way."
"The Wars of the Roses (1455–1485) had been going on for years. They were fought over the throne of England between supporters of the House of Lancaster and supporters of the House of York. Both houses were branches of the Plantagenet royal house, tracing their descent from King Edward III."
King Henry VI and his family the House of Lancaster fought against their enemies for many years. The wars finally came to an end when King Henry VII of England came to the throne in 1485
"On 22 August 1485, Henry's army defeated Richard III's army at the Battle of Bosworth Field. When Richard III died in this battle, Henry VII became king. Other people also had a claim on the throne, and Henry did his best to stop them from taking it from him, either by executing them, putting them in prison, or trying to make friends of them, as he did with the Earl of Lincoln. Another step he took was to marry Elizabeth of York, the niece of King Richard III, who would herself have been the heir to the throne if she had not been a girl."
"There were also people who pretended to be long-lost members of the royal family, so that they could try to take the throne. One of these was a little boy called Lambert Simnel, who looked very like Edward, Earl of Warwick. The real Earl of Warwick was Henry's prisoner, but this did not stop other people from believing that Lambert was him. The Earl of Lincoln rebelled against King Henry and raised an army to make Lambert king, thinking that he himself could rule the country. There was a battle, and the Earl of Lincoln was killed. Lambert Simnel was captured, but, because he was only a child, Henry spared his life and he became a royal servant."
"Henry married Elizabeth of York, and by this action put an end to the Wars of the Roses. They had six children, but only four survived infancy:"
Henry VII increased taxes so future kings would have enough money. People disliked that.
Death.
"Henry VII died of tuberculosis in 1509 and was buried in Westminster Abbey. He was succeeded by his son, Henry VIII on 21 April 1509."
"Dover, Kent"
"Dover is a town on the coast in Kent, in the United Kingdom. It was built by the Romans. There is a castle in Dover, called Dover Castle. It is the largest castle in England. The population is about 39,078. Throughout history, it has been an important port of Britain because it is the closest port to mainland Europe. The sea between Dover and the French port of Calais is called the Strait of Dover. It is the narrowest part of the English Channel at only wide."
"The ferry port in Dover has ferries to Calais, France and Ostende, Belgium. Almost 45,000 people and 15,000 vehicles pass through the port every day. On of the largest tourist attractions around Dover are the White Cliffs of Dover."
Dover History.
"The Romans first tried to invade Dover in 55BC, under Julius Caesar. They were forced back by the Celts, who fiercely defended the coastline. It was not until 43 AD, under the rule of Emperor Claudius, that Roman forces landed on British soil at Richborough and took control of the land as far as the northern border. Dover, then called DVBRIS, became the Romans' most important naval town."

The Tsar's Bride
"The Tsar's Bride (""Tsarskaya nevesta"" in Russian) is an opera by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. It was the tenth opera the composer wrote. The words (libretto) were written by Il’ya Tyumenev who based the story on a book called “The Tsar’s Bride"" by Lev Mei. The opera was composed in 1898. The first performance took place in 1899 at the Moscow theater of the Private Opera of S.I. Mamontov."
The story of the opera.
"The story is supposed to take place in the autumn of 1572 in Moscow. At this time Russia was ruled by a very cruel tsar called Ivan the Terrible. Tsar Ivan had a group of people who guarded him. They were called oprichniki. The oprichniki were like bodyguards, but they were told to kill anybody who was not loyal to the tsar, so they behaved like terrorists, killing, raping and stealing wherever they went. In the opera there are also “Boyars”. A Boyar was a nobleman."
Act 1: The Feast.
"Griaznoy is an oprichnik. Although he already has a lover, Lubasha, he now decides he loves Marfa, the daughter of the merchant Sobakin. Marfa is already engaged to be married to Lykov, a boyar. There is much merrymaking and singing at a feast. Then Griaznoy asks to be left alone with Bomelius, the tsar’s doctor. He asks him to get him a love potion. Lubasha, who is hiding, hears what he says and realizes that he does not love her any more. When the doctor goes, Griaznoy is horrible to Lubasha and tells her to go. She now wants to talk to Bomelius."
Act 2: The Love Potion.
"A lot of people are coming out of church. They talk about the autumn weather, but when the oprichniki appear they are very frightened and start talking about whom the tsar is going to choose for his bride . Marfa talks to her friend Duniasha about how she has loved Lykov ever since they were children. Tsar Ivan passes by. She does not recognize him, but she is very frightened at the way the Tsar is staring at her. Sobakin comes in with Lykov and the four of them sing about looking forward to the wedding."
Lyubasha now goes to Bomelius and asks for another magic potion which she wants to give to Griaznoi to stop him loving Marfa. Bomelius says he will give her the potion if she will make love to him. Lyubasha agrees and goes inside with him.
Act 3: At the wedding.
At the wedding celebrations Sobakin tells Lykov that he will have to wait before his marriage to Marfa can be confirmed. The Tsar himself is looking for a girl to marry and has asked to see Sobakin’s daughters. Griaznoy realizes he needs to use the love potion quickly so he asks to be invited to the wedding. At the celebration he puts the potion in Marfa’s drink. A messenger comes with the news that the Tsar has chosen Marfa to be his wife. Everyone is horrified and Sobakin collapses.
Act 4: The Bride.
"Sobakin is at the Tsar's palace. He is proud because his daughter is now the Tsarevna (the Tsar’s wife) and he himself has been made a Boyar. But he is also worried because Marfa has become very ill. Griaznoy comes in and greets Sobakin (who are now both boyars). He says that the person who poisoned Marfa has confessed. Marfa rushes in and tells Griaznoi to speak. He says that Lykov was tortured and then confessed to having poisoned Marfa. Lykov was then executed by Griaznoi himself. Marfa goes mad when she hears this. In her madness she thinks Griaznoy is Lykov. This eventually makes Griaznoy confess that he himself at put the potion into her drink. He did not realize it was poisonous. Lyubasha then confesses that she had put her potion in the place of Griaznoi’s potion. She blames Griaznoy and invites him to kill her. He kills her, then he is taken to prison to be executed. As he is taken away, Marfa, in her madness, once again mistakes Griaznoy for Lykov. She invites him to return the next day to visit her. Then she dies."
Bubble sort
"Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm. It is simple to understand, so it is usually taught to new students. It is not as efficient as some other sorting algorithms."
"Bubble sort's name comes from the fact that each item in the list “bubbles” up to where it should go, like bubbles in water."
Algorithm.
"The algorithm compares pairs of elements in a list. The elements the make up the pairs are next to each other. Starting at one end of the list, the two elements in each pair are compared to each other in order. That means for example, the first and second element are compared, then the second and third element, and then the third and fourth, and so on. If the elements in the current pair are out of order, then the two elements switch places. This process – of comparing two elements – is done over and over again, until the whole list is sorted. The list is sorted, when there are no more pairs that have to be swapped."
"In the best case scenario, where the list was already sorted before running the algorithm, the algorithm's complexity is O(n) (Big O notation). In the worst case, where the list starts off as being sorted in reverse, O(n²)."
Implementation.
"In an imperative programming language, bubble sort can be implemented by using a flag variable and looping through the array's elements:"
"Alternatively, since the greatest value ascends to the highest index within the first iteration and then has reached its final ""right"" position, two for-loops nested into one another sort the vector, too:"
for top ≔ high(vector)−1 downto low(vector) do
for current ≔ low(vector) to top do
if vector[current] &gt; vector[current+1] then
"exchange(vector, current, current+1)"
Maundy Thursday
"Maundy Thursday, also known as Holy Thursday, Covenant Thursday, Great &amp; Holy Thursday, and Thursday of Mysteries, is the Christian feast or holy day falling on the Thursday before Easter that commemorates the Last Supper of Jesus Christ with the Twelve Apostles as described in the Canonical gospels. It is the fifth day of Holy Week, and is preceded by Holy Wednesday and followed by Good Friday."
"Disgust is an emotion. People feel it when they see, touch, hear, or taste something that they think is nasty or repulsive. It is also caused by scorn. For example, when one finds something dirty or not fit to eat. Levels of disgust vary based on cultural, religious, and personal backgrounds/experiences. Disgust can be deliberate as someone can do something on purpose to create this emotion."
Oven
"Ovens are closed, heated containers which are used for heating, baking, and drying. It is used the most often in cooking and pottery. They provide even, dry heat to all surfaces of food inside them. An indoor oven can have an electric heating element, or be fired by natural gas or coal. Outdoor ovens are often made of brick or clay and are buried in hot coals. An oven which is used for making pottery is called a kiln. An oven used for heating or industrial processes is called a furnace. They are hot inside, and often things come out of them hot."
History.
The people in the settlements of the Indus Valley Civilization were the first to have an oven inside of their mud-brick houses by 3200 B.C.
People who study the history of food give credit to the Greeks for making the baking of bread into an art. A type of oven called Front-loaded bread ovens were created in ancient Greece.
Pot
"A cooking pot is a vessel to cook in. It is often larger than a pan, and will be taller than it is wide."
"Pots are used for boiling liquids, like soups or stew."
Liquid
"A liquid is a form of matter. It is settled between solid and gas. Liquid has an almost-fixed volume, but no set shape."
"Every small force makes a liquid change its shape by flowing. Because of that, gravity makes liquids always take the shape of the container. The molecules that make up the liquid can freely move among themselves."
Fluids that flow slowly have a high viscosity. Some fluids like tar have such a high viscosity that they may seem solid.
"It is difficult to compress a liquid. If a liquid is cooled down until it is colder than a certain temperature, it will become a solid. This temperature is called the melting point or freezing point and is different for every different type of liquid. If a liquid is heated up it becomes a gas. The temperature this happens at is called the boiling point."
"Examples of liquid are water, oils and blood."
"In a liquid, the liquid on the top presses down on the liquid underneath, so at the bottom the pressure, ""p"", is bigger than at the top. The equation for working this out is:"
"where ""z"" is the depth of the point below the surface and ""g"" is how strong gravity is pulling on the liquid. ""ρ"" is a number that tells us how heavy a set amount of the liquid is. We call this the density and it is different for all liquids."

White
"White is the brightest color. White light can be made by putting all the other colors of light on the spectrum together. These other colors are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet."
Meaning of white.
"White is linked with light, goodness, innocence, purity, cleanliness and virginity. It is sometimes thought to be the color of perfection. The opposite of black, white usually has a positive connotation. White can stand for a successful beginning. In heraldry, white depicts faith and purity."
"In advertising, white is linked with coolness and cleanliness because it is the color of snow. You can use white to show simplicity in high-tech products. White is an appropriate color for charitable organizations; angels are usually imagined wearing white clothes. White is associated with hospitals, doctors, and cleanliness, so you can use white to show safety when promoting medical products. White is often linked with low weight, low-fat food, and dairy products."
French Guiana
"French Guiana () is an overseas department and region of France, on the north Atlantic coast of South America. By land area, it is the second largest region of France and the largest overseas department of France and of the European Union."
"The first period of Japan's history is its prehistory, before the written history of Japan. Archeologists have found pottery from that time. Japan’s Paleolithic era covers a period from around 100,000 BC to around 12,000 BC. Archeologists have found some polished tools made of stones. Some of them are kept in Tokyo National Museum. These tools are more than 32,000 years old."
Jomon Period.
"The Jomon period lasted for about 10,000 years, from 10,000 BC to around 300 BC. This was the Mesolithic era for Japan. Some scholars say that during this period, Neolithic culture also developed in Japan."
Archeologists have found several pieces of pottery of that time. Some are clay figures and some are vessels and potteries of different shapes.
Yayoi Period.
"The Yayoi period covered about 550 years, from around 300 BC till around 250. The period's name came from a location in Tokyo."
"By that time, Japanese people had learnt the cultivation of rice, and agriculture became the main part of the Japanese society. Because of this, differences in social status started to occur."
"Different clans controlled different areas and they also fought among themselves. Some Chinese texts tell about this time. These texts describe Japan as Wa. Later, the Yamatai came into being when about 30 smaller parts of Japan of that time united under a queen named Himiko."
Ancient and Classical Japan.
"The Ancient and Classical period covers about 900 years, beginning from the mid-3rd century till the end of the 12th century. Japanese history during this period may further be divided into several smaller periods. These are described below."
Kofun period.
"In the history of Japan, the period from the mid-3rd century until the mid-6th century is known as the Kofun period."
"Kofun is a large tomb made at this era, and people who had social power were buried. Buddhism had not reached Japan by this time. Many kofuns were made in many places. This fact lets us to know that many social groups all around the country made up an authority, and this leads to the Yamato dynasty."
"The Yamato dynasty started to have take more action against Korea and China. In the 4th century, they started to advance to Korea to get iron. By this, cultures and technologies of Korea and China started to be introduced to Japan. They also fought with Goguryeo and Silla, which are countries in Korea. In the 5th century, the five kings of Wa made effort to have relationship with China."
Asuka period.
The second period is called the Asuka period (mid-6th century till around 710). Asuka is the place where the base of Yamato dynasty took place. By this time Buddhism had reached Japan.
"From the end of the 6th century to the early 7th century, Empress Suiko and her nephew Prince Shotoku innovated the political system so that the emperor gets power. They also sent missions to the Sui dynasty."
"The trend of centralization still continues. In 645, the Taika Reforms takes place, and the political system changes a lot."
"In 663, the nation fights with the Tang dynasty and Silla (Battle of Baekgang), but loses."
"In 672, the Jinshin war occurs and Prince Ōama becomes the emperor (Emperor:Tenno天皇). In his era, Japan starts to make a Chinese style law system (Ritsuryo). Also, the word , which means ""Japan"" in Japanese, was started to be used in the era of Tenmu."
Nara Period.
"During this period, from the year 707, steps were taken to shift the capital to Heijō-kyō, a place near present-day Nara. This was completed in 710. A new city was built. The city was built to look like the Chinese capital city of that time. At that time, the Tang Dynasty was ruling China, and the capital was at Chang'an (now Xi'an)."
"During the Nara period, development was slow. The Emperor’s family members were always fighting for power with the Buddhists and other groups. At that time, Japan had friendly relations with Korea and China’s Tang Dynasty. The capital was shifted twice. In 784, the capital was moved to Nagaoka and in 794 to Kyoto."
Heian Period.
"The years from 794 to 1185 are known as the . This grouping of years is named after city of Heian-kyō, which is the early name of present-day Kyoto. The Heian period produced many cultural achievements, such as the Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu."
"The power of the Japanese imperial court (that is, the Emperor, his ministers and other important persons) rose. This period is also famous for its art, poetry and literature. Japanese culture also became Japanese way.The language used in this period was called Late Old Japanese. The writing systems known as Kana emerged at this time. By the end of this period (that is, by the end of the 12th century), a number of groups came into being. These groups were highly armed and they fought among themselves. The situation was like a civil war, that is, war among different sections of society. Finally, groups of people called Samurai led society under the political rule of a Shogun. The Heian Period ended due to the Genpei War."
Feudal Japan.
"The period from around the 12th century through the 19th century is called feudal period in the history of Japan. The Japanese Emperor was the head of the government, but he had no real power. Many powerful families (called daimyo and military groups called shogun) ruled Japan during this period. The feudal period of Japan is generally sub-divided into different periods named after the shogunate which ruled during that period."
Kamakura Period.
"The years 1185 to 1333 are known as the . This grouping of years is named after city of Kamakura which was the center of power of the Kamakura shogunate. Minamoto no Yoritomo was the founder and first shogun of the Kamakura shogunate. The period is named after the government of Kamakura Shogunate. In this period, Mongols tried to invade Japan between the years 1272 and 1281. Japanese were successful at driving away the Mongols. But, this badly affected Japan. Shogunate also became weak and its rule ended in 1333. For a short time, Go Daigo became the emperor of Japan."
Muromachi Period.
The Muromachi Period began in 1336 and ended in 1573. Emperor Go-Daigo lost his throne. The government of the Ashikaga shogunate took control of most parts of Japan. This period ended in 1573. In that year the 15th and the last shogun named Ashikaga Yoshiaki was forced to leave the capital Kyōto.
"In general, the values for 5, 50, and 500 are not subtracted. Here is the same number using the subtraction rule:"
Special values.
Zero.
"The number zero does not have its own Roman numeral. At about 725, Bede or one of his colleagues used the letter N, the abbreviation (short form) of ""nihil"" (the Latin word for ""nothing"")."
Fractions.
"The Romans also used fractions. The most common base for fractions was 1/12, which in Latin is called ""uncia"" (ounce)."
Large numbers.
"A number of numeral systems are developed for large numbers that cannot be shown with , , , , , and ."
Apostrophus.
"One of the systems is the ""apostrophus"", in which D is written as IƆ (500) and M is written as CIƆ (1,000). In this system, an extra Ɔ means 500, and multiple extra Ɔs are used to mean 5,000, 50,000 etc."
Vinculum.
"Another system is the ""vinculum"", in which V, X, L, C, D and M are multiplied by 1,000 by adding an overline."
Map
"A map is an image of an area, usually of the Earth or part of the Earth. A map is different from an aerial photograph because it includes interpretation. Many maps are called ""charts"" such as star charts and nautical charts. Some maps are of distant worlds. Before the late 20th century almost all maps were on paper. Today, many maps are digital, and can be seen on smartphones and computers. However, paper maps are still used."
"The word ""map"" can also be used to talk about a chart or drawing that shows relationships between ideas, people, events, or anything else you can think about. This is why web developers call a list of web pages on a web site a site map."
People who make maps are cartographers.
Many maps today are made using GIS computer systems. These are database systems that are organized by location instead of named records.
"If a map is on a piece of paper or a computer screen, it has to be projected. This is because the Earth is round and paper and screens are flat. There are a lot of ways that use mathematics to make map projections. The only kind of map of the Earth that is not projected is one drawn on a sphere. This is called a globe."
Globe
"A globe is a scale model with the shape of a sphere. Globes can be scale models of the Earth (""terrestrial globes"") or of other planets. Globes can also be models of the celestial sphere (""celestial globes""). The English word ""globe"" comes from the , meaning round mass or sphere."
Most globes are maps of the Earth. They have the advantage of avoiding the distortions of flat map projections. The most common types are political and physical. Political globes show countries. Physical globes show landscape like mountains and rivers. Some globes are star charts and some are maps of distant worlds.
"Global as an adjective is used to mean the entire world rather than any special place on the Earth. It is also used in fields like computers to mean dealing with a whole larger system, rather than its individual little parts."
History.
"That the Earth is a sphere was established by Hellenistic astronomy in the 3rd century BC. The terrestrial globe appeared in that period. Now, there are no terrestrial globes from Classical Antiquity or the Middle Ages in existence. The first example of terrestrial globe known was the one the ancient Greek Crates of Mallus made in the middle of the 2nd century BC. The Greek geographer Strabo wrote about Crates's terrestrial globe during the early years of the Roman Empire."
"A celestial globe from Classical Antiquity is in the Naples National Archaeological Museum, Italy. The globe is part of a sculpture – the globe is held up by a statue of Atlas, a Titan from Greek mythology. The ancient Romans made the globe and statue in the 2nd century AD. They may have copied the sculpture from Hellenistic art (art of the ancient Greek type) from the Hellenistic period (the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd centuries BC). The sculpture's name is the ""Farnese Atlas""."
"Early globes of the Earth that show all of the Old World were constructed in the Islamic Golden Age. One such example was made in the 9th century AD by Muslim geographers and cartographers working under the Abbasid caliph, al-Ma'mun. Another example was the globe introduced to Beijing by the Persian astronomer, Jamal ad-Din, in 1267."
"Martin Behaim designed a globe in 1492, in Nuremberg, Bavaria (Germany). Georg Glockendon was the artist who created the actual map drawings following Behaim's specifications. This globe is the oldest terrestrial globe still in existence. A copy of the globe showing America was made by Martin Waldseemueller in 1507. Another early globe, the Hunt-Lenox Globe, ca. 1507, is thought to be the source of the phrase ""Here be dragons"". Another ""remarkably modern-looking"" globe of the Earth was made in Constantinople (Istanbul) by Taqi al-Din at his Constantinople Observatory during the 1570s."
Manufacture.
"Mass-produced globes are typically covered by a printed paper map. The most common type has long, thin gores (strips) of paper. These strips narrow to a point at the North Pole and the South Pole. Then a small disk is used to paper over the irregularities at the poles. The more gores there are, the less stretching and crumpling is needed to make the paper map fit the sphere."
"From a geometric point of view, all points on a sphere are the same. One could select any point on the planet, and create a paper map that covers the globe with strips that come together at that point and the opposite point."
Ferret
"Ferrets (""Mustela putorius furo"") are domestic animals. They are the domestic form of the European polecat. They are in the weasel genus of the family Mustelidae."
"Ferrets have an average length of 20 inches (51 cm) including a 5-inch (13 cm) tail, weigh about . They live for about 7–10 years. Males are larger than females. They are sociable animals, and are usually kept in groups of two or more."
"With their long thin body, ferrets look like a large weasel. They may have different colours and markings on their fur. A lot of ferrets in one place will sometimes have a strange smell. This is caused by natural oils produced by the ferrets."
Behavior.
"As naturally crepuscular animals, ferrets tend to sleep during the day. This deters many people from getting them although most ferret owners say their ferrets change their sleeping schedules to that of their owners."
Ferrets and humans.
"Domesticated ferrets are used for hunting, or can be kept as pets. Hunting with ferrets is called ferreting. Because of their thin body, they can go down into holes and hunt rodents and rabbits. Ferrets have been kept as pets since the Middle Ages."
Health.
"Ferrets suffer from several health problems. Some of the most common health problems are cancers affecting the adrenal glands, pancreas, and lymphatic system. Viral diseases include canine distemper and influenza. Health problems can happen in unspayed females when not being used for breeding. Certain colors of ferret may also carry a genetic defect known as Waardenburg syndrome. Similar to domestic cats, ferrets can also suffer from hairballs and dental problems"
Ferrets as pets.
Ferrets are legal to have as a pet in most places. They are not legal in a few places in the United States. Ferrets should be vaccinated. A breeder or pet store will get it spayed or neutered and also de-scented. Ferrets can spray the natural oils from their anal glands similar to that of a skunk if not de-scented.
Ferrets are very flexible and can fit into small holes to flush out rabbits or rodents. Ferrets can get through open vents or small holes in walls. Ferrets are good climbers so if curtains are touching the floor they can easily climb the curtains.
"Ferrets should be kept in a group, unless you can provide them with multiple hours of activity, they get quite bored when alone. Ferrets tend to sleep curled up together in a ball usually making them indistinguishable from one another."
Diet.
Ferrets are carnivores and cannot tolerate grains or vegetable matter well. Their diet should consist of around 20% fat and 80% meat. Ferrets need a high calorie diet: commercial dog and cat foods do not contain enough fats and protein to suit them. Feeding them such a diet while convenient will ultimately shorten the ferrets life.
"Ferrets are subject to insulinoma and as such they should not be given fruits except on rare occasions as a treat. Raisins are a favorite of most ferret but should be given extremely sparingly. Fresh chicken, turkey or even duck is a good choice for your ferret. Commercial ferret foods are available but many contain grains and also fruits and as such are not suitable for them. Research brand ingredients or find a recipe to make your own."
Three Dog Night
Three Dog Night is an American rock band. They were popular from the late 1960s and early 1970s. They had 21 hit singles and 12 gold albums between 1969 and 1975.
Grand Funk Railroad
"Grand Funk Railroad were an American rock group from Flint, Michigan. They were popular in the early and mid 1970s."
The Sweet
"The Sweet (also known as Sweet) are a British glam rock band. The group is famous for the songs such as ""Ballroom Blitz"", ""Little Willy"", ""Fox on the Run"" and ""Love is Like Oxygen"". The group was originally called Sweetshop."
Prince (musician)
"Prince Rogers Nelson (better known as Prince) (June 7, 1958 – April 21, 2016) was an American musician and dancer. He was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota."
"He was known for blending erotic lyrics with funk rock and technology. He had ten platinum albums and thirty Top 40 singles during his career. His releases have sold over 350 million copies worldwide. From 1993 to 2000, Prince changed his name to a glyph. Since this symbol was impossible to pronounce, people began calling him ""The Artist Formerly Known As Prince."""
"In addition to his own musical career, he was a ""talent promoter"" for the careers of Sheila E., Carmen Electra, The Time and Vanity 6."
"Since the ovules are protected by carpels, it takes something special for fertilisation to happen. Angiosperms have pollen grains made of just three cells. One cell drills down through the integuments, to make a passage for the two sperm cells to flow down. The megagametophyte is a tiny haploid female plant which includes the egg. It has just seven cells. Of these, one is the egg cell; it fuses with a sperm cell, forming the zygote. Another cell joins with the other sperm, and forms a nutrient-rich endosperm. The other cells take auxiliary roles. This process of ""double fertilisation"" is unique, and is common to all angiosperms."
Evolution of flowers.
"Flowers are modified leaves. They are only present in flowering plants (angiosperms), which are relatively late to appear in the fossil record."
"Early fossils of flowers and flowering plants are known from 130 million years ago, in the Lower Cretaceous. However, flowers had a much longer history, the extent of which is not yet fully known. There were flowers from the early Jurassic, 50 million years earlier than was previously thought."
"The flowering plants were thought to have evolved from within the gymnosperms. However, the known gymnosperms are a clade which is distinct from the angiosperms. Apparently, the two clades diverged (split) some 300 million years ago. That is about the boundary of the Carboniferous period with the Permian period."
Uses of flowers.
As decoration.
"Flowers have long been admired and used by humans. Most people think that flowers are beautiful. Many people also love flowers for their fragrances (scents). People enjoy seeing flowers growing in gardens. People also enjoy growing flowers in their backyards, outside their homes. People often wear flowers on their clothes or give flowers as a gift during special occasions, holidays, or rituals, such as the birth of a new baby (or a Christening), at weddings (marriages), at funerals (when a person dies). People often buy flowers from businesses called florists."
As a name.
"Some parents name their children, most often girls, after a flower. Some common flower names are: Rose, Lily, Daisy, Holly, Hyacinth, Jasmine, Blossom."
As food.
"People eat some types of flowers. Flower vegetables include broccoli, cauliflower and artichoke. The most expensive spice, saffron, comes from the crocus flower. Other flower spices are cloves and capers. Hops flowers are used to flavor beer. Dandelion can be made into wine."
"Honey is flower nectar that has been collected and processed by bees. Honey is often named by the type of flower that the bees are using (for example, clover honey). Some people put flowers from nasturtiums, chrysanthemums, or carnations in their food. Flowers can also be made into tea. Dried flowers, such as chrysanthemum, rose, and jasmine, can be used to make tea."
Special meanings.
"Flowers were used to signal meanings in the time when social meetings between men and women was difficult. Lilies made people think of life. Red roses made people think of love, beauty, and passion. In Britain, Australia and Canada, poppies are worn on special holidays as a mark of respect for those who served and died in wars. Daisies made people think of children and innocence."

Square kilometre
"A square kilometer (sometimes written ""km²"") is based on the SI unit of measurement of area, the ""square meter"". It is the area inside a square that has each side equal to 1 kilometer (1000 meters). This way of talking about area is often used to say how much land there is, on a farm or in a city, for example."
One square kilometer is just less than 0.39 square miles.
Judge
A judge is a person who is in control of a court of law.
"The way to become a judge depends on each country. In some countries, judges must work with the law (often as a lawyer) for a number of years before they can ""sit as a judge"" in a courthouse. Judges are supposed to conduct the trial in an open courtroom and impartially."
"In many English speaking countries, judges cannot make some decisions on their own. In these countries, juries are used, but not for all cases. The modern jury trial first developed in mid-12th century England during the reign of Henry II. Today, the details differ between one country and another."
"If there is a jury, the judge has the job of making sure the person taken to court is treated in a fair way. Some courts will have more than one judge. For important decisions about the laws of a country, countries may have a ""supreme court"" or ""high court"" with many (nine or more) judges in it. In the United States, judges on a supreme court are called ""justices"" and are led by a ""Chief Justice""."
"In many countries, judges wear special clothes while being in court. Often this is a black robe or cloak. Supreme or High Court judges often wear a red cloak. Judges in some countries also wear a special long wig. They also used to put a piece of black material on their head when they sentenced a person to die."
Vincent van Gogh
"Vincent Willem van Gogh (30 March 1853 – 29 July 1890) was a Dutch post-impressionist painter. His work had a great influence on modern art because of its striking colours and emotional power. He suffered from delusions and fits of mental illness. When he was 37, he died by committing suicide."
"When he was a young man, Van Gogh worked for a company of art dealers. He traveled between The Hague, London and Paris. After that, he taught in England. He then wanted to become a pastor and spread the Gospel, and from 1879 he worked as a missionary in a mining place in Belgium. He began drawing the people there, and in 1885, he painted his first important work, ""The Potato Eaters"". He usually painted in dark colors at this time. In March 1886, he moved to Paris and found out about the French impressionists. Later, he moved to the south of France, and the colors in his art became brighter. His special style of art was developed and later fully grown during the time he stayed in Arles in 1888."
Early life.
"He was born Vincent Willem van Gogh on 30 March 1853 in Groot-Zundert, Netherlands. His father, Theodorus van Gogh, was a pastor. His mother, Anna Cornelia Carbentus, was an artist. Van Gogh was brought up in a religious and cultured family. He was very emotional and he did not have a great deal of self-confidence. He was also a replacement child. He was born a year after the death of his brother, also named Vincent. He even had the same birthday. Living at the church rectory Vincent walked past the grave of his dead brother every day. There has been speculation that van Gogh suffered later psychological trauma as a result, but this cannot be proved."
Career.
"Between 1860 and 1880, when he finally decided to become an artist, van Gogh had two sad romances. He also had worked unsuccessfully in a bookstore, as an art salesman, and a preacher. He remained in Belgium, where he had preached, to study art. The works of his early Dutch period are sad, sharp, and one of the most famous pictures from here is ""The Potato Eaters"", painted in 1885. In that year, van Gogh went to Antwerp where he found the works of famous artists and bought a lot of Japanese prints."
"In 1886 he went to Paris to join his brother Theo, who was the manager of Goupil's gallery. In Paris, van Gogh studied with Cormon. He also met Pissarro, Monet, and Gauguin. This helped the colors of his paintings lighten and be painted in short strokes from the paintbrush. His nervous temper made him a difficult companion and night-long discussions combined with painting all day made him very unhealthy. He decided to go south to Arles where he hoped his friends would join him and help found a school of art. Gauguin did join him, but it did not help. Near the end of 1888, Gauguin left Arles. Van Gogh followed him with an open razor, but was stopped by Gauguin. Instead, he cut his own ear lobe off. After that, van Gogh began to get fits of madness and was sent to the asylum in Saint-Remy for medical treatment. He painted over 1,000 portraits."
Death.
"In May 1890, he regained his health and went to live in Auvers-sur-Oise. However, two months later on 27 July, he shot himself in the chest with a revolver. He died two days later, with Theo at his side. Theo reported his last words as ""La tristesse durera toujours"", which meant, ""The sadness will last forever"" in French."
Legacy.
"During his brief career he had only sold one painting. After his death, Van Gogh's finest works were all sold in less than three years. His mother threw away a lot of his paintings during his life and even after his death. But she lived long enough to see him become a world famous painter. He was not well known when he was alive, and most people did not appreciate his art. But he became very famous after his death. Today, many people consider him to be one of the greatest painters in history and an important influence on modern art. Van Gogh did not begin painting until he was almost 30. Most of his famous works were done in his last two years. He made more than 2,000 artworks, with 900 paintings and 1,100 drawings and sketches. Today, many of his pieces portraits, landscapes and sunflowers are some of the most famous and costly works of art in the world."
Rainbow
"A rainbow is an arc of colour in the sky that can be seen when the sun shines through falling rain. The pattern of colours, called a spectrum, starts with red on the outside and changes through orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet on the inside. Sometimes a second, larger, dimmer rainbow is seen."
"A rainbow is created when white light is bent (refracted) while entering a droplet of water, split into separate colours, and reflected back. A rainbow is actually round like a circle. On the ground, the bottom part is hidden, but in the sky, like from a flying airplane, it can be seen as a circle around the point opposite the Sun."
"Rainbows often appear after storms, and are popular symbols for peace in many cultures."
Cause.
The rainbow effect can be seen when there are water drops in the air and the sun is giving light at the back of the observer at a low distance up or angle.
Rainbows always appear opposite the Sun: they form circles around the shadow of your head (which is the point opposite the Sun).
"While sunlight is white, all white light is actually a blend of many different colours. Water and other materials bend the different colours at different angles, some more strongly than others. This is called dispersion. By splitting up white light into its separate colours, rainbows appear colourful even though the source of light hitting them is white."
The rainbow displays with the deepest effect in our minds take place when:
Another common place to see the rainbow effect is near waterfalls. Parts of rainbows can be seen some of the time:
An unnatural rainbow effect can also be made by spraying drops of water into the air on a sunny day.
The seven colours of the rainbow.
"The rainbow has no definite number of physical colours, but seven are traditionally listed. Below is a commonly used list of seven colors in the order seen in a rainbow. Computer screens cannot show them precisely but can make colors that look similar. (Each color shows the number codes used to tell a computer how to display the color.)"
The gray rainbows.
"&lt;li style = ""background-color: #755496;""&gt; Violet-gray"
"(Hex: #755496) (RGB: 117, 84, 150)&lt;li&gt;"
Central Intelligence Agency
"The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is part of the US federal government and is located at the George Bush Center for Intelligence in Langley, Virginia. The agency was formed in 1947 after World War II. Many of the people who started the CIA had been in the Office of Strategic Services, the main American spy agency during the war. General John K. Singlaub was one of the people who created the CIA."
Types of retaining wall are:
Main type of walls.
"Load Bearing Wall is a structural element. It carries the weight of a house from the roof and upper floors, all the way to the foundation. It supports structural members like beams, slab and walls on above floors."
Non-Load Bearing Wall doesn't help the structure to stand up and holds up only itself. It doesn't support floor roof loads above. It is a framed structure. Most are interior walls whose purpose is to divide the structure into rooms.
"Partition Wall separates spaces from buildings. It can be solid, constructed from brick or stone. It is a framed construction. The partition wall is secured to the floor, ceiling, and walls. It is enough strong to carry its own load. It resists impact. It is stable and strong to support wall fixtures. The partition wall works as a sound barrier and it is fire resistant."
"Cavity Wall A cavity wall or hollow wall consists of two separate walls, called leaves or skins, with a cavity or gap in-between. The two leaves of the cavity wall may be of equal thickness if it a non-load-bearing wall or the internal leaf may be thicker than the external leaf, to meet the structural requirements."
Veneered Wall holds up the material. It can be made of brick or stone. The most famous veneered wall is made of brick. The wall is only one wythe thick. It became the norm when building codes began to require insulation in interior walls. It is light weighted. Veneered walls can be built quickly.
Coordinated Universal Time
"Coordinated Universal Time (or UTC) is the standard time system of the world. It is the standard by which the world regulates clocks and time. It is, within about 1 second, mean solar time at 0° longitude."
"The standard before was Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). UTC and GMT are almost the same. In fact, there is no practical difference which would be noticed by ordinary people."
"Some websites, for example Wikipedia, use UTC because it does not make any country look more important than the others. It offers one time for all the Internet (the same time can be used by people all over the world)."
"Time zones are often named by how many hours they are different from UTC time. For example, UTC−5 (United States east coast) is 5 hours behind UTC. If the time is 07:00 UTC, the local time is 02:00 in New York (UTC−5) and 10:00 in Moscow (UTC+3)."
07:00 UTC is also written more simply as 0700Z (or 07:00Z).
"Note that UTC uses the 24-hour clock. That means there is no 'AM' or 'PM'. For example, 4:00PM would be 16:00 or 1600. UTC also does not use daylight savings time - that way the time stays consistent the entire year."
"When this page loaded, it was , , in UTC."
Television
"A television set (also known as a television receiver or televisor or simply a television, TV set, TV receiver or TV) is a machine with a screen or set of lenses. Televisions receive broadcasting signals and change them into pictures and sound. The word ""television"" comes from the words tele (Greek for ""far away"") and vision (""sight"")."
Sometimes a television can look like a box. Older TVs had a large cathode ray tube in a large wooden frame and sat on the floor like furniture. Newer TVs are much lighter and flatter.
A TV can show pictures from many television networks. Computers and mobile devices also can be used for watching television programs.
"The television was invented in the 1920s but the equipment was expensive and the pictures were poor. By the 1950s, these problems had been fixed and TVs became widespread."
"At first, all televisions used an antenna (or aerial). This would pick up television programmes from broadcasting stations. A TV station could be many miles or kilometers away, and still be received. TVs can also show movies from VCD and DVD players or VCRs. Cable TV and Satellite television can provide more programs at once than broadcast can. Video game consoles connect to most modern TVs. Some computers can also use a TV as a computer monitor."
"All TVs have screens where the picture is viewed. Before the 1950s these were usually ""black and white"", which made everything look grey, but all modern TVs show colors. Most 20th century screens also had rounded corners. That is because television screens were cathode ray tubes. These are like heavy glass jars with one side bulging out to form the screen."
"Today flat panel displays are the usual kind. These are usually flat rectangles with straight edges. This long rectangle looks more like the shape of a movie theatre screen. This is called widescreen. If a widescreen set was 30 cm tall, it would be 53 cm wide. For this to work best, TV shows also need to be made in widescreen. Widescreen sets can still be any size, but they have the same widescreen shape."
The early 21st century is also when digital television transmission became more common than analog television.
Sociology
"Sociology is the study of societies and how humans act in groups. Sociology is a social science. People who study sociology are called sociologists. A society is the community of people living in a particular country or region and having shared customs, laws, and organizations."
"Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès in 1780 was first to use the term. The problems caused by the change to an industrial society, where many people moved to cities and worked in factories, were an early focus of sociology. Auguste Comte, Max Weber and Émile Durkheim were leading figures in the study of social phenomena. Themes included: community, authority, status, alienation and lack of power."
"In the 2000s, some sociologists look at such things as: race, ethnicity, class, gender, the family and social interaction. They also study the breakdown of social structures; crime and divorce."
Work of sociologists.
"Argon is gotten industrially by the fractional distillation of liquid air. About 700,000 tonnes of argon are produced worldwide every year."
"40Ar is made by the decay of 40K with a half-life of 1.25 billion years by electron capture or positron emission. Because of this, it is used in knowing how old rocks are."
Uses.
"Argon is often used when welding steel and similar work, to push away the air around the weld, so the oxygen in the air can't join with the metal being welded. It can also be used in neon lights for a purple color. Argon is used in the poultry industry to asphyxiate birds. Argon is sometimes used for extinguishing (ending) fires."
"Liquid argon is used in neutrino experiments and looking for dark matter. Argon is used to preserve food. Argon is sometimes used as the propellant in aerosol cans. Argon is also used as a preservative for such products as varnish, polyurethane, and paint. Argon has been used by athletes as a doping agent and has been banned as use. It is used to know how old rocks are."
Trade
"To trade is to willingly give things or services and get other things or services in return. For example, a person giving a thing must find another person who wants to get that thing. The giver gets something back in return. A trade is sometimes also called an ""exchange"" or a ""swap""."
An early type of trade is barter. Barter was the exchange of goods and services for other goods and services. Barter involves trading things without using of money. Modern traders commonly buy and sell by the use of money. Trade between two traders is called bilateral trade. Trade between more than two traders is called multilateral trade.
Terms.
The things that are given from one person to the other are called goods.
"Services can also be part of a trade. One person can do a job or work for another, and get something in return in a trade."
"Money can be given in return for a service or for a thing. If money is part of the trade, then the person who gives the money is buying, and the person who gets the money is selling."
A place where trading takes place is called a market.
"When there is no money involved in the trade, the trade is called barter. If there is money involved in the trade, the trade is called a purchase. In the past people would barter to get what they wanted, instead of buying goods and services."
Economics includes the study of trade.
"Trade occurs not just between people, but also between large companies and even countries. Governments sometimes take some of the money or goods involved trade between countries. This is a type of tax called a tariff. Smugglers try to trade without paying tariffs."
"Free trade between two countries is when there are small or no tariffs, quotas, or other restrictions on trade. When one country stops all trade with another country, it is called an embargo."
Types of trade.
Domestic trade.
Domestic trade is the exchange of goods within a country. Domestic trade is very important because it allows different types of goods to reach to all parts of the country. It makes the standard of living of the people of the country better. It helps an industry to grow by making sure that there are raw materials. Domestic trade may be divided into two. They are:
Wholesale.
"Wholesaling is the sale of goods to industrial, commercial, institutional or other professional businesses. They can also be sold to other wholesalers. It is the sale of goods to anyone that is not a consumer. Wholesalers usually buy and sort goods in large numbers."
Retail.
"Retail is the process of selling goods or services to consumers through many means of distribution to earn a profit. The term ""retailer"" usually means where a person sells a small amount of good to many individuals, who are consumers."
International trade.
"International trade is the exchange of goods and services between different countries. International trade has existed throughout history. Some examples include Uttarapatha, Silk Road, Amber Road, scramble for Africa, Atlantic slave trade, and salt roads. When there is trade between two or more countries, factors like currency, government policies, economy, judicial system, laws, and markets affect trade."
International trade may be split up into three different types.
Import.
An import is a good or service that was bought in one country but was produced in another country.
Export.
An export is a good or service that was produced in one country but was sold to another country.
"Pollyanna is an orphan. She arrives in the town of Harrington to live with her rich Aunt Polly. The girl is a happy youngster who believes in the goodness of life. She makes many friends. Aunt Polly controls the town because she is the richest citizen. The people of Harrington want an old orphanage rebuilt. Aunt Polly opposes the idea. The people defy Aunt Polly and plan a bazaar to raise funds for a new building. Aunt Polly is furious. She forbids Pollyanna to participate. On the evening of the bazaar however, Pollyanna slips away and has a wonderful time. She returns home. She tries to avoid her Aunt by climbing a tree outside her bedroom window. She falls and injures her legs. Her cheerful spirits sink, making recovery doubtful. The people of Harrington learn of Pollyanna's accident. They visit her and assure her that she is loved. Pollyanna's spirits return to their usual cheerfulness. She leaves for Baltimore with Aunt Polly to have an operation on her legs."
Tropaeolum
"Tropaeolum is a genus of roughly 80 species of annual and perennial herbaceous flowering plants and the only genus in the family Tropaeolaceae. The genus ""Tropaeolum"" is native in Central America and South America. The roots of the specie T. polyphyllum from Chile can survive underground when air temperatures drop as low as -15°C (5°F)."
Yun Hyu
"Yun Hyu (Korean:윤휴, 尹鑴, October 14, 1617–May 20, 1680) was a Neo-Confucian scholar, politician, and soldier during the Korean Joseon Dynasty. His other names were Baegho (백호, 白湖) and Haheon (하헌, 夏軒). His Chinese style names were Du'goe (두괴, 斗魁) and Huijung (희중, 希仲). He was a middle-ranking member of the North Man party."
The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)
"The Sleeping Beauty is a ballet in a prologue and three acts. Marius Petipa and Ivan Vsevolozhsky wrote the story of the ballet. It was based on Charles Perrault's 1697 fairy tale ""The Sleeping Beauty in the Wood"". Tchaikovsky wrote the music. Marius Petipa designed the dances. ""The Sleeping Beauty"" was first presented at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia, on 15 January 1890. Carlotta Brianza danced the Princess and Pavel Gerdt the Prince, with Marie Petipa as the Lilac Fairy and Enrico Cecchetti as Carabosse. It was first presented in Europe in a shortened version by the Ballets Russes in London on 2 November 1921. Catherine Littlefield designed the first complete ""Sleeping Beauty"" in the United States, and presented the production on 12 February 1937 at the Academy of Music, Philadelphia, with the Philadelphia Ballet."
Background.
"About ten years after Tchaikovsky's ""Swan Lake"" was presented for the first time, Tchaikovsky was asked to write a ballet for the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg. The ballet would be based on Charles Perrault's fairy tale ""The Sleeping Beauty in the Wood"". Tchaikovsky was very happy this story had been chosen. It was set in the age of Louis XIV. He would have the chance to write music in the Baroque style."
"Petipa gave Tchaikovsky very special directions about tempi, meter, and other musical matters. He even specified the length of particular pieces in exact numbers of bars. He asked for a Waltz in Act 1, a Mazurka in Act 2, and a Polonaise in Act 3. The ballet is tied together (and its drama and suspense heightened) through the repeated use of the two musical themes representing good and evil, personified by the Lilac Fairy and Carabosse respectively. Petipa's specifications stimulated Tchaikovsky's imagination, rather than hindered it as one might expect."
"Tchaikovsky's interest in setting the tale reaches back to 1867. It was then that he wrote a little ballet on the story for the children of his sister Alexandra Davydova. He had done the same for ""Swan Lake"". In November 1888, he had a conference with theater officials and Petipa. A draft of the scenario was drawn up. Petipa provided Tchaikovsky with a detailed analysis of the musical requirements. The composer set to work, and finished the score on 1 September 1889."
Story.
Prologue.
"A brief overture contrasts the themes of the malicious Carabosse and the benevolent Lilac Fairy. When the curtain rises, the court assembles for Princess Aurora's christening. Six fairies present their gifts. Carabosse, a fairy overlooked by the master of ceremonies, enters. She curses Aurora. The Princess shall die on her 16th birthday, she says, after pricking her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel. The remaining seventh fairy the Lilac Fairy comes forward. She cannot put the curse to rest, but she can soften it. The Princess shall not die, she commands, but sleep one hundred years. At the end of that term, a Prince will awaken her with true love's kiss."
Act 1.
"Sixteen years after the christening of Princess Aurora, the court assembles in the palace gardens to celebrate Aurora's birthday. Villagers dance a waltz. Aurora dances an adagio with four noble suitors. Carabosse enters unnoticed and slips Aurora a spindle. The Princess pricks her finger on the spindle. She falls to the ground, sound asleep. The Princess is carried into the palace by the noble suitors. The Lilac Fairy puts the entire court to sleep, then causes a dense forest of trees and thorns to surround the castle."
Act 2.
"""Scene 1."" ""The Prince's hunt. A woodland glade with a river in the background."" The stage is empty. Hunting horns are heard. Prince Desire, his tutor Galifron, and his friends enter. They have paused in the hunt to take refreshments. Several dances are performed by various ladies of the court. The hunt is resumed. The Prince is tired so chooses to remain alone in the forest. Here, he meets the Lilac Fairy who emerges from a boat of mother of pearl on the river. She has chosen him as the prince to awaken princess Aurora, and presents various visions of the princess to him. He quickly falls in love with her from the visions and begs the Lilac Fairy to lead him to her. The Lilac Fairy guides him through the forest until they reach the enchanted castle where Aurora rests."
"""Scene 2."" ""Sleeping Beauty's castle."" The Sleeping Beauty lies on a canopied bed. The King and Queen sleep in armchairs nearby. The courtiers and pages sleep standing up and leaning upon one another. Dust and cobwebs cover everything. The Lilac Fairy and the Prince enter. He tries to rouse the Princess and the court, but without success. The Lilac Fairy stands aside without interfering. The Prince kisses the Princess. She awakens. The dust and cobwebs disappear. The court awakens. The King grants the marriage of the Prince and Princess."
Act 3.
"""The Wedding of Prince Désiré and Princess Aurora on the esplanade of King Florestan's palace."""
"The court assembles to celebrate the marriage of Prince Désiré and Princess Aurora. The King and Queen make their entrances with the newlyweds. The festivities begin with a series of ""divertissements"". The Diamond, Gold, Silver, and Sapphire Fairies dance. Several fairy tale characters dance: Puss in Boots and the White Cat; the Bluebird and Princess Florine; Little Red Riding Hood and the Wolf; Cinderella and Prince Fortuné; and finally Hop o' My Thumb with his brothers and the ogre. The Prince and Princess dance a ""pas de deux"". Roman, Persian, Indian, American, and Turkish characters dance a Sarabande. The act ends with a ""tableau vivant"" representing the Glory of the Fairies. This ""tableau"" was changed to represent the Glory of Apollo."
Human settlement
"In archaeology, geography, and history, a human settlement is a place where people live, either permanently (all the time) or temporarily (only some of the time). When people go to an area to live there, it is called settling an area. When they come from far away it is sometimes called a colony. The term may include hamlets, suburbs, towns and cities. Nomadic people do not settle."
Microtia
"Microtia meaning 'small ear' is a deformation of the outer ear. Over 90% of the time, only one ear is affected, but both ears can be affected. More boys are affected than girls. The right ear is more affected than the left. One in 1000 people have microtia. It can affect hearing. There are four grades of microtia:"
"Grade III is most common, and can be corrected by surgery."
Act I.
"Jaquino is a prison guard. He wants to marry Marzelline, the daughter of Rocco who is the warden of the prison. But Marzelline has just fallen in love with someone she thinks is a man called Fidelio. Actually Fidelio is a woman who has dressed up as a man so that she can get into the prison where her husband Florestan is a prisoner (he has been arrested for political reasons). She is pretending to return Marzelline’s love so that she can find a way of rescuing Florestan. Rocco says he is happy for Marzelline to marry Fidelio. Fidelio (Leonore) says she will help Rocco with his job of looking after the prisoners. Rocco says she can do this, but there is one prisoner she is not allowed to guard. He has been locked up alone for two years. Leonore thinks it may be her husband, but she is not sure."
"Don Pizarro, the military governor of the prison, hears that the prison is going to be looked at by inspectors who make sure that the prison is being properly managed. He knows that he should not have locked Florestan up, so decides to kill him before the inspection starts. He asks Rocco to dig the grave so that he can get rid of the body quickly. Rocco does not want to do this, but has to agree."
"Leonore lets the prisoners have a walk in the garden. Rocco tells Leonore that he must help him dig the grave. Rocco is very cross that the prisoners are walking in the garden, but Rocco says they should be allowed because it is the King’s name-day. Rocco says they should be locked up again. So he locked them again."
Act II.
Florestan sits alone in his cell. In his mind he imagines an angel who looks like his wife who is telling him to come to Heaven.
"Leonore goes with Rocco to the prisoner. She is still not sure whether it is her husband. She gives him some bread. When Pizarro comes he gets ready to kill Florestan, but Leonore stands between them and tells Pizarro she will shoot him if he comes nearer. A trumpet is heard playing a fanfare because the Minister is arriving."
"Outside the prison the Minister says that all the prisoners are now free. He is horrified to find Florestan among the prisoners, because he is his friend. The crowd ask for Pizarro to be punished. Leonore frees her husband from his chains and the crowd say that she is a great heroine."
The Overtures.
"Beethoven made several changes to the opera at different times. This included writing four different overtures. They are called ""Leonore 1"", ""Leonore 2"", ""Leonore 3"" and ""Fidelio"". The overture ""Fidelio"" is the one that is normally heard now at the beginning of the opera. ""Leonore 2"" was the overture performed at the first performance in 1805. ""Leonore 3"", composed in 1806, is the most famous of the overtures. ""Leonore 1"" may have been written in 1805, or it may have been intended for a performance in 1807 in Prague which never took place"". Sometimes the ""Leonore 3"" overture is played during Act II between the two scenes. However, many people think it does not work dramatically there. It is usually heard today as a separate concert piece. The overture ""Fidelio"" was composed for performances of the opera in 1814."
Für Elise
"""Für Elise"" (German for ""For Elise"") is the common name of the ""Bagatelle in A minor"", written by Ludwig van Beethoven in 1810. The song is thought to be written for Therese, a woman that Beethoven wanted to marry in 1810, however his handwriting was misspelt undergoing transcription, allowing the piece to be known as Fur Elise rather the Fur Therese. Therese did not want to marry him."
"The piece of music, which was written for the piano, was not published until 1865, a long time after Beethoven’s death. It is one of the most well-known pieces of piano music in the world."
Form.
"The piece is in rondo form. There is a main section (A) which appears three times. Between these three sections there are two other sections (B and C), so the form of the piece can be described as: A B A C A."
"The main section has a time signature of 3/8. It is based on arpeggios which flow from one hand to the other. This is the section that many beginner pianists want to play. The two middle sections are harder to play at the correct speed. They have fast scales, arpeggios and left hand demisemiquavers (32nd notes)."

Teplice
"Teplice (German name: Teplitz) is a city in Bohemia, the western area of the Czech Republic. Teplice (pronounced in Czech: “Tep-li-tse”) is a famous spa town where, in earlier times, lots of famous people went for holidays to improve their health. Goethe, Beethoven, Chopin, Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner all stayed there."
Teplice lies between Prague and Dresden in a mountain area called Krušné hory (Iron Mountains). In the year 762 hot springs were found there. The waters from these springs helped people who were ill to get better so it became a spa town.
"Since 1990 many buildings have been restored. The Krušnohorské divadlo (Krušnohorské theatre) is now being refurbished. The North Bohemia Philharmonic Orchestra give concerts there in the open air. There is a museum and many restaurants, wine bars and cafés. In the winter the mountain slopes are good for skiing."
Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)
"Symphony No. 9 in D minor, Op. 125, is a symphony written by Ludwig van Beethoven. It is one of the most famous pieces of music ever written."
"A symphony is a piece of music for orchestra. Beethoven wrote nine symphonies. This one, the last one he wrote, is very unusual because the last movement also has singing in it: there are four soloists (soprano, alto, tenor and bass) and a choir. This is why it is known as the “choral” symphony (“choral” means: “for choir”). It is a very long work, lasting more than an hour. This, too, was unusual."
"This symphony has four movements. The first movement is in sonata form. The second and third movements come the other way round from the usual order: the second movement is the scherzo and the third movement is the slow movement. It is a theme and variations. The last movement sets the words of a poem by Friedrich Schiller, a famous poet who had only recently died. The poem was called ""Ode an die Freude"" (in English: ""Ode to Joy""). The poem has a strong message to all mankind: it is about living in peace and harmony together. It was written at the time of the French Revolution when these ideas were becoming very important in Europe."
"The main tune of the last movement (sung to the words: “Freude, schöne Götterfunken, Tochter aus Elysium”) is one of the best known tunes in the world. Many children like to play it on instruments because the first part of the tune only uses five notes (it can be played on C, D, E, F, G). When the tune comes the first time in the symphony it is played by the cellos and double basses."
"The ""Ode to Joy"" was adopted as Europe's “National anthem” in 1972, with an official arrangement for orchestra written by Herbert von Karajan."
"Beethoven had been interested in Schiller’s famous poem since he was young. In 1817 he started to write the first two movements of the symphony. In 1822 he decided to use Schiller’s poem in the symphony. Most of the rest of the symphony was written in 1823 and he finished it in 1824. It was first performed in May of that year. Beethoven conducted the performance. The story is told that he wondered why the audience were not applauding when it had finished. They were applauding, but Beethoven was deaf so he could not hear. Caroline Unger, the alto soloist, made him turn round, and he saw that people were applauding enthusiastically."

Bible
"The Bible, also known as the Holy Bible, is a group of religious texts of Judaism and Christianity, it contains both The Old Testament and The New Testament. The word Bible comes from the Greek word τὰ (""biblía"") which means ""books"" in English, because it is many books in one book. It includes laws, stories, prayers, songs, and wise words. A number of texts are both in the Hebrew Bible, used by Jews, and this Christian one."
"In considering the source and inspiration for the Bible one must see what the Bible says of itself. Several verses of scripture define the source, intent, and Author. 2 Peter 1:21 says this - ""No prophecy was ever made by the act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God."" Isaiah 55:11 tells us that His is a word of power - ""So shall My sword be that goes forth from My mouth; It shall not return to Me void, But it shall accomplish what I please, And it shall prosper in the thing for which I sent it."" Hebrews 4:12 says this - ""For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart."""
"When talking about the Bible, a ""book"" is used to speak about a number of texts. All the texts that make a ""book"" are believed to belong together. Most of the time, people believe they were written or collected by the same person. The Bible contains different kinds of such books. Some are history, telling the stories of the Jews, Jesus, or Jesus' followers. Some are collections of wise sayings. Some are God's commands to his people, which he expects them to obey. Some are songs of praise to God. Some are books of ""prophecy"", messages from God that he gave through chosen people called prophets."
"Different groups of Christians do not agree which texts should be included in the Bible. Christian Bibles range from the 66 books of the Protestant canon to 81 books in the Ethiopian Orthodox Bible. The oldest surviving Christian Bible is the Codex Sinaiticus, a Greek manuscript from the fourth century AD. The oldest complete Hebrew manuscripts date from the Middle Ages."
How it was written.
"For a long time the texts were passed on by word of mouth from generation to generation. The Bible was written long ago in Aramaic, Hebrew, and Greek. Translations were made later into Latin and some other languages. Now there are translations in English and many other languages. The books of the Hebrew Bible—what Christians call the Old Testament—were not all written at the same time. It took hundreds of years (about 1200 years). The process of putting it all together began around 400 B.C. The books of the New Testament, which was originally written in Greek, began to be collected together in about 100 A.D. It tells about events that happened between 4 B.C. and 70 A.D. These events included the birth, life, death and resurrection of Jesus. It also tells how his followers went around spreading his message. It ends with a description of how the world will end when Jesus returns to earth. Most of the writers of the New Testament were apostles of Jesus. These were people who said they had seen Jesus alive after his crucifixion."
Translations and versions.
A translation is when a scribe takes the source in one language and writes it in another language. Most texts of the Bible were written in Ancient Greek or in Aramaic or Hebrew.
"The first to provide a translation into Latin was Jerome, in the 5th century. He started what is known as the Vulgate today. Wufila translated the Bible into the Gothic language. In the early Middle Ages, people such as Petrus Valdes, and Jan Hus provided translations."
"The New Testament was first translated into English in 1382 by John Wycliffe, and his associates translated the Old Testament. The translation was made from the Vulgate Latin bible. Wycliffe did this so that people could see for themselves what the Bible said. The translation was completed in 1382. There were some later editions by other people to the Wycliffe bible, as it is called. It was translated into Middle English, the language of his day. Wycliffe did not have Church permission to do this, but he was protected by John of Gaunt, one of the most powerful men in the kingdom. After both Wycliffe and his protector were dead, the Church declared Wycliffe a heretic in 1415, and banned his writings. The Council of Constance decreed Wycliffe's works should be burned and his remains exhumed (dug up). Why was the Church so opposed? The translations challenged the Church's authority over the people. In church, explaining the Bible was the priest's work. Whatever he said could not be challenged. Once the ordinary people could read the Bible, they might have other opinions."
"The next step in translation was done in 1525 by William Tyndale. His translation was into Early Modern English, which we can just about understand today. Tyndale also did it without Church permission. His was the first translation to be printed, and several thousand copies were made. He had no protector, and his fate was terrible. He fled to Europe, but the agents of Thomas More (Chancellor of England at the time) eventually found him. Both Tyndale and his printer were executed by burning at the stake."
Another well known translation is the 1611 King James translation (commonly known as the Authorized King James Version of the Bible).
Some texts were written by historians who tried to show what Ancient Israel was like. Other texts are poems about God and his work. And others were used to make laws. Followers of Judaism and Christianity consider the Bible sacred but they do not all agree about what belongs in the Bible. What is considered part of the Bible changed with history. Different denominations include certain parts or leave out other parts. There is not one single version of the Bible; both the content of the books and their order may change.
"Languages do not match. When a translation is done, the translator has to decide between translation word for word, or capturing the sense of the text. When he decides to capture the sense, he will choose other words in the target language. This is called paraphrasing."
"Today there are dozens of versions of the Bible. Some are translations and some are paraphrases. A paraphrased version is where people take a translation and put it in their own words. As the Bible has been translated into modern languages, it is also possible that there are different translations of the same texts. The Bible is the best selling book of all time. 2.5 billion to more than 6 billion copies of the Bible have been sold to date. A complete version of the Bible exists in 471 languages. Parts have been translated in 2225 languages. Most Bibles can be found in the British Museum in London."
Old Testament.
"The Christian Bible is a collection of 66 books. The first 39 books are the Old Testament. It is the first part of the God's story of salvation. ""Salvation"" is God's long work of saving us from our sins. ""Sin"" is what happened when people decided to live their own way instead of God's way in the world that God created. That was when God began His great work of saving us from our sins."
"To prepare the way, God had to destroy the whole world by a great flood, except for the family of Noah. Then God raised up a new people for Himself. They were the ancient Hebrews. God promised the Hebrews they would bring His salvation to the whole world."
"The first five books of the Old Testament are mostly the story of how God chose the ancient Hebrews and taught them his laws. Following these are the twelve books that tell the history of the Hebrews. The next five are books of poetry and wisdom. One of these five books, the ""Psalms"", is a book of songs showing mainly how God wants to be worshiped."
"The last seventeen books of the Old Testament were written by Hebrew prophets. These books tell about God's disappointment with the ancient Hebrews and His promise to bring them back to friendship with Him. The prophets also foretell a great surprise God was planning for the world-He was going to send His very own Son, the Messiah (the ""Anointed One""), the Saviour, to save us from our sins."
You can read about this Messiah in the New Testament.
"In the Old Testament, Tanakh was mostly written in Hebrew; a few parts were written in Aramaic. This part of the Bible is considered to be holy by Jews as well as Christians."
"There are also a few books of the Old Testament's time called Deuterocanonical by those Churches that accept them as part of the Bible, and Apocrypha by those that do not."
New Testament.
"The second part is called the New Testament. The main part of this book is the story of the life of Jesus Christ. The four different versions of this story in the New Testament are called the Gospels. After the Gospels, there is also the story of what happened to the Church after Jesus's death and resurrection. Part of this is told through letters by early Christian leaders, especially Saint Paul. The final book of the Bible tells about a vision that St. John, one of the disciples of Jesus, had. In the vision John saw what would happen at the end of the world. This included judgement for evil and happiness for the people who had followed Jesus. One of the most quoted verses in the Bible is : ""For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish [die] but have eternal life."" NIV"
Views about the Bible.
Violin
"The violin is a string instrument which has four strings and is played with a bow. The strings are usually tuned to the notes G, D, A, and E. It is held between the left collar bone (near the shoulder) and the chin. Different notes are made by fingering (pressing on the strings) with the left hand while bowing with the right. Unlike guitar, it has no frets or other markers on the fingerboard."
The violin is the smallest and highest pitched string instrument typically used in western music. A person who plays the violin is called a violinist. A person who makes or repairs violins is called a luthier.
"The violin is important in European and Arabian music. No other instrument has played such an important part in Europe. The modern violin is about 400 years old. Similar string instruments have been around for almost 1000 years. By the time the modern orchestras started to form in the 17th century, the violin was nearly fully developed. It became the most important orchestral instrument - in fact, nearly half of the instruments in the orchestra is made up of violins, which are divided into two parts: ""first violins"" and ""second violins"". Nearly every composer wrote for the violin, whether as a solo instrument, in chamber music, in orchestral music, folk music, and even in jazz."
"The violin is sometimes called a “fiddle”. Someone who plays it is a “fiddler”. To ""fiddle"" means ""to play the fiddle"". This word can be used as a nickname for the violin. It is properly used when talking about folk music, but is used in all kinds of music."
History.
"The word “violin” and the word “viol” come from the same word. The violin was not made directly from the instruments called viols. The word ""violin"" comes from the Middle Latin word ""vitula"". It means ""stringed instrument"". This word is also believed to be the source of the Germanic “fiddle”. The modern European violin changed over time from many different bowed stringed instruments. They were brought from the Middle East and the Byzantine Empire. Most likely, the first makers of violins took ideas from three kinds of current instruments. They are the rebec, in use since the 10th century, the Renaissance fiddle, and the ""lira da braccio."" These instruments were held under the chin and bowed."
"In the 17th century, there were several families of luthiers who were very good at making instruments. The most famous violin makers were Stradivarius, Amati, and Guarneri. Some of the instruments that these luthiers made are still here today. They are kept in museums all around the world. They are some of the best instruments in existence. They can have prices over one million dollars."
Construction.
"The biggest part of the violin is the wooden body. This acts as a resonating box. It makes the vibrating strings sound louder. Many of the parts of the violin are named after parts of the body. The front is called the “belly”. The back is called the “back”. The sides are the “ribs”. The strings go from near the top of the “neck” down the “fingerboard” and on to the “tail piece”. The strings go across the bridge halfway between the end of the fingerboard and the tailpiece. The bridge is not fixed onto the violin. It is held in place by the strings. The strings keep it in place because they are so tight. If the strings are completely loosened, the bridge will not stay on. The bridge helps to send the vibrations of the strings down to the body of the instrument. Inside the body there is a “soundpost”. This is a small piece of wood. It looks like a small finger. It goes from the belly to the back. The soundpost is also held in place by the strings. In the middle of the belly there are two long, curved holes. They are called “f holes”. This is because of their shape. The top of the strings are wound around pegs. The violin can be tuned by turning the pegs. The very top of the neck is called the scroll. Violins today also have a chinrest. This helps to hold the violin against the player's shoulder. A shoulder rest can also be used. These are now made of foam. They have special legs to hold them on to the violin. Many beginners prefer to use a sponge and an elastic band instead."
"To make it easier to tune the violin, many people find it helpful to have “adjusters” for “fine tuning” when the string is only slightly out of tune. These adjusters go through holes in the tailpiece. They stop the strings from slipping when being tuned."
Strings used to be made of gut. They are now mostly made of steel or nylon. Adjusters can only be used with some strings. The front of the violin body is made of spruce. The back and sides of the body are made of maple. The bow can be made of several kinds of wood. An example would be pernambuco. Some players today use bows made of carbon fibre. The bow is strung with horsehair (horsehair is hair that comes from the back of the horse's head also known as the mane or from the horse's tail).
Playing.
"It takes years of practice to become a good violinist. A beginner will start with pieces and or exercises that do not require precise or complicated technique in right or left hand. Some examples of pieces that do not require great technique are ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" by Mozart, ""Children's Song"" (A German folk tune), and ""Over the Rainbow"". During these ""simple"" songs, the violinist will develop fundamental skills necessary for all other techniques, such as proper bow and violin holding. As the musician develops more and more confidence and skill in both left and right hand, pieces and exercises will become progressively more difficult. When necessary, they will also learn techniques and skills that will enhance their playing. Vibrato, smooth bow changes in the right hand, and shifting."
"The violinist has to learn to put the fingers in exactly the right place so that the music is “in tune”. This is called intonation. The musician will also learn vibrato. This changes the intonation of each note slightly by making it a little bit sharper (higher), then a little bit flatter (lower), producing a kind of wobble. This is important in many styles of music to create mood."
"Besides plucking (pizzicato), there are many special effects. Some of them are glissando, portamento, and harmonics. There is also double stopping, chords, and scordatura tuning."
"The violin can be played either standing or sitting down. When playing solo music the violinist normally stands. When playing in chamber music or in orchestras the violinist sits, but this was not always the case. When sitting, the violinist may have to turn his or her right leg in so that it does not get in the way of the bow."
Music.
"In the 17th and 18th centuries, composers wrote a lot of music for solo violin. Many of these composers were from Italy. They were themselves violinists. Some of these violinists are Corelli, Vitali, Vivaldi, Veracini, Geminiani, Locatelli and Tartini."
"In Germany, Schmelzer and Biber wrote some very virtuoso violin music. Later, in the early 18th century, Bach and Handel wrote many masterpieces for the violin."
"In the Classical music period, the great composers Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven all wrote solo works for the violin. They also wrote a large amount of chamber music, especially string quartets."
"In the Romantic period many virtuoso violin works were written. These include concertos by Mendelssohn, Saint-Saëns, Brahms, Bruch, Wieniawski, Tchaikovsky, and Dvořák. In the 20th century, many virtuoso works were written. These include Elgar, Sibelius, Szymanowski, Bartók, Stravinsky, Berg, Prokofiev, Shostakovich, Hindemith, and Penderecki. In the 19th century, Niccolò Paganini was the most famous violinist. He composed and played violin music that was harder than anything that had been written before. People compared him to the devil because he could play so brilliantly and because he looked thin and moved his body about in strange ways."
In recent years the violin has also been used in jazz playing. Stéphane Grappelli was especially famous for this.
Famous violinists.
"Some of the most famous violinists of the last century are Fritz Kreisler, Jascha Heifetz, David Oistrakh, Yehudi Menuhin, Ida Haendel, and Isaac Stern. Today some of the greatest players include Itzhak Perlman, Maxim Vengerov, Vadim Repin, Nigel Kennedy, Hilary Hahn, Joshua Bell and fiddler Sara Watkins."

Train station
"A train station or railway station (also called a railroad station, rail station, or depot) is a place where passengers can get on and off trains and/or goods may be loaded or unloaded."
"Early stations were usually built to handle passengers and goods. Today, goods are usually only unloaded at big stations. Stations are next to a railway line, or they are the terminus for a route. Usually there are platforms to let passengers get on and off the train easily and safely. Many stations have things such as shelters, ticket sales and benches."
"The legs of a butterfly are made for walking, holding onto things, and tasting. There are three pairs of legs. There are four main parts of the leg. They are the trochanter, the femur, the tibia, and the foot. At the end of each foot, there is a pair of claws. Butterflies in the family Nymphalidae have very short front legs. They keep there front legs close to their bodies. This makes it look like they only have two pairs of legs. In some species, there is a movable body part on the tibia that is used to clean the antennae."
"A butterfly has two pairs of wings. Each wing has hollow tubes called veins. The colors and patterns of butterflies are made by tiny scales. The scales overlap each other. They are connected to the wing. If a butterfly is handled, the tiny scales may rub off."
Abdomen.
"The abdomen is the third part of the body. It is made up of ten segments. The abdomen is much softer than the head and the thorax. At the end of the abdomen are the reproductive organs. In the male, there is a pair of claspers. They are used to hold on to the female during mating. In the female, there is a tube to lay eggs (the ovipositor)."
Life cycle.
Butterflies go through complete metamorphosis. This means that there are four parts in a butterfly's life. The first part is the egg. The second part is the caterpillar (sometimes called the larva). The third part is the chrysalis (sometimes called the pupa). The fourth part is the adult (sometimes called the imago).
Egg.
"A female butterfly will lay her eggs on or near the food plant of the caterpillar (the food plant is the plant that the caterpillar feeds on). The female will choose a place to lay her eggs using smell, taste, touch, and sight. Most species will lay just one egg on the food plant. Others will lay groups of five to over 100 eggs on the food plant. Most species will lay their eggs on the leaves of the food plant. Others will lay them on the flowers, stems, bark, or fruit of the food plant."
"The eggs come in many different shapes and colours. They may be round or oval, and flattened. In some species, the egg shell is ribbed. The most common colours in butterfly eggs are yellow and green. The eggs will turn dark just before hatching. Also, some butterflies take a day to come out of eggs, while others could take months."
Caterpillar.
"Butterfly caterpillars can vary in size, colour, and shape. They may have spines, bristles, or soft body extensions. All caterpillars have 13 body segments. The first three segments make up the thorax. The thorax has three pairs of legs. These legs are called true legs. The other 10 segments make up the abdomen. The abdomen has five pairs of soft legs called prolegs. The prolegs have tiny hooks at the end of each of the foot. They are used to hold on to things. The hooks are called crochets."
"A caterpillar's skin does not grow. As the caterpillar grows inside its skin, the skin becomes too tight. In order for the caterpillar to grow bigger, it sheds its too-tight skin. After the old skin is shed, there is a new, larger skin. This is known as moulting. A caterpillar will moult four to five times before turning into a pupa. Each stage between moults is called an ""instar""."
All caterpillars can make silk. The silk is made from the salivary glands. Silk starts out as a liquid in the salivary glands. The caterpillar draws out the silk into a small thread. The silk hardens as soon as it is exposed to the air. Caterpillars use silk to make nests or cocoons.
"Most caterpillars feed on leaves of plants or trees. Most species of caterpillars will feed only on a small number of certain kinds of plants. If the caterpillar's food plant is not found, it may starve to death."
"Some species of caterpillars (in the family Lycaenidae) are tended by ants. The caterpillars have special glands that make a sweet liquid called honeydew. The ants like the honeydew. In return for the honeydew, the ants protect the caterpillars from predators. The caterpillars also have special body parts that make sounds. The caterpillar will make sounds with the body parts and ""call"" the ants when the caterpillar is being attacked by predators. The ants hear the sounds and come to protect the caterpillar."
"Caterpillars in the subfamily Miletinae eat insects in the order Hemiptera. This includes aphids, mealybugs, leafhoppers and treehoppers.p356"
"Caterpillars in the family Papilionidae have a special organ. This organ is called an osmeterium. It is a bad-smelling gland that is shaped like a snake's tongue. It is kept behind the inside of the head. When a predator tries to eat the caterpillar, the caterpillar releases the osmeterium. This usually scares the predators away.p161"
Pupa.
"The pupa (plural, pupae) is formed after the last moult. The caterpillar will find a special place to pupate (pupate means to turn into a pupa). The digestive tract is emptied. The caterpillar sheds its skin. The pupa is now exposed. The caterpillar's tissues are broken down and rebuilt into the butterfly's tissues."
The pupa cannot move. It is attached to an object by tiny hooks on the end of the abdomen. These hooks make up what is called the cremaster. There are many tiny holes on the pupa. They allow respiratory gases to move in and out of the pupa.
"Many pupae are easy for predators to attack. Some caterpillars (in the family Hesperiidae and the subfamilies Parnassiinae and Satyrinae) make shelters out of silk and leaves to protect themselves when they become pupae. These shelters are called cocoons. Most butterfly pupae do not have cocoons to protect themselves. Instead, the pupae have brown or green colours to camouflage themselves among leaves and branches. Pupae that do not have cocoons are called chrysalids or chrysalises."
Survival.
"Some butterflies may be in trouble because of habitat loss. Because of the destruction of forests and grasslands, some types of butterflies have nowhere to feed and lay eggs. To help, some people plant a butterfly garden with flowers having lots of nectar for butterflies to feed on. Some people also keep plants that butterflies lay eggs on, and enjoy watching the caterpillars hatch out and feed on the plant. Chemical sprays that are used to keep pests away from garden plants, also kill butterflies."
Nazism
"Nazism (or National Socialism; ) is a set of political beliefs associated with the Nazi Party of Germany. It started in the 1920s, but the Nazi Party gained power in 1933 and started carrying out their ideas in Germany, which they called the Third Reich. They stayed in power in Germany until 1945, when they lost World War II."
"National Socialism is an extreme right-wing, fascist, ideology that is heavily inspired from the works of Oswald Spengler. The Nazis believed that only the Aryan (German) race was capable of building nations and other races, notably the Jewish race, were agents of the corruptive forces of capitalism and Marxism, both of which the Nazis opposed. They considered the Aryan race the 'Master race', which meant that they thought that the Aryans were the most biologically evolved of humans and therefore deserved to have power over all other humans. They adapted Charles Darwin's theory of evolution and applied it to humans."
"The leader of the Nazis Adolf Hitler wanted to a create a country where all Aryans were treated equally. They spent heavily on poorer people and began several huge government programs to help Germany deal with the unemployment and economic crisis caused by the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression which followed it. Some Nazis, such as Ernst Röhm, wanted the reforms to go further and called for a revolution, eliminating economic classes in Germany and for the government to take control of major businesses. Many of these Nazis were murdered on Hitler's orders during the Night of the Long Knives because they were a threat to his leadership of the Nazi Party."
"The Nazis blamed the Jewish people for Germany's defeat in World War I. This is known as the Stab in the Back Myth. The Nazis also blamed the Jewish people for rapid inflation and practically every other economic woe facing Germany at the time as a result of their defeat in World War I. For this reason, the Nazis not only viewed the Jewish people as inferior to them, but as oppressors of the Aryan people who were creating inequality. The Nazis' tactic of lazily albeit effectively blaming the Jewish people for all of Germany's problems is a propaganda tactic known as scapegoating and was used to justify the great atrocities committed by the Nazis against the Jewish people."
"To implement the racist ideas, the Nuremberg Race Laws (created in 1935) banned non-Aryans and political opponents of the Nazis from the civil-service. They also forbid any sexual contact between 'Aryan' and 'non-Aryan' persons."
"The Nazis sent millions of Jews, Roma, and other people to concentration camps and death camps, where they were killed. These killings are now called the Holocaust."
"The word ""Nazi"" is short for ""Nationalsozialist"" (supporter of the ""Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei"") in the German language. This means ""National Socialist German Workers' Party""."

"Yeah,"
"Last week going to the airport,"
I just hit a downpour
and I was on a highway going like eighty.
So I really did.
I mean I was soaking wet.
I thought I would drown in the seconds that it took me to pull over
Whoops.
"But it all dried out, you know. Didn't  take long when the sun came out"
Yeah.
but it was kind of funny.
I'm sure people around me really enjoyed it
"but,"
Oh. No I was just down in Austin last week
and the weather was pretty nice too.
"So,"
Oh
"and wasn't it pretty last week with the Bluebonnets and everything,"
"yeah,"
yeah.
"With the Bluebonnets out,"
yeah.
It really was.
Yeah
I decided that Austin is certainly someplace that I could handle living.
is Yeah.
A lot of people say that
and it's pretty far from where I live
I'm ready if you are.
Okay.
"Um, where do you stand, uh, on,"
"Well, I think that people should be allowed to have them."
"Especially  if they go hunting,"
"I think, I think because most kids don't have a car at college, the ones that do get taken advantage of"
"and, you know, there is just, I think it's just trouble waiting to happen."
"So I would advise they didn't, they didn't take a car"
"and, uh they didn't take a television"
"Is it,"
and they didn't take a refrigerator
"Maybe that,"
"Uh, I didn't do any of those, though,"
I feel less strongly about the T V and refrigerators.
"No,"
"I, I,"
"Yeah,"
"we didn't have,"
"Well, let me see,"
what have you seen lately?
"Well, uh, CITY SLICKERS, and STAR TREK FIVE."
FIVE?
Yeah
yeah.
"only, only five?"
Yeah.
I thought I'd better see that one before I go and see six.
"Well, no,"
didn't need to.
"No,"
I found that out
How about yourself?
I just saw the latest one.
How is it?
It was fantastic.
"Oh, I can't wait."
"Yeah,"
I have a personal computer at home.
It's an A T compatible.
I don't use it very much any more.
I used to use it quite a bit.
Uh-huh.
I also have a P C at work that I use as a terminal.
"I do some P C stand alone work on it,"
and I can transfer data back and forth between the P C and the main frame.
Uh-huh.
What about you?
Do you own a computer?
"Um, well I sort of own a computer."
"We have two P C at home,"
but neither one do we really own. Um.
Are you leasing them?
"No,"
"both of them are sort of work related,"
"and,"
Loaners from work?
"Yeah,"
"that's the nicer way, right."
Do you work for T I?
"No,"
no.
"Um, I, actually I'm doing consulting right now because I just had a baby,"
"and my husband's working at Bell Labs,"
"but he's really from France,"
and these computers actually are from France.
What brand are they?
One of them's a Compaq
Uh-huh.
it's a three eighty-six
"Yeah,"
"it, it, it was heavy when we were there though."
Yeah.
"I didn't see any boats there, though."
"Not, not, not too many, no."
"But, uh, no,"
I just got back from a weekend.
"We went and, uh, had a, kind of a picnic in the woods type thing."
"It was pretty nice,"
"but, uh, no, I, I have, uh, I had a boat last summer that I took out, a catamaran that I do, did a lot of sailing on and stuff."
Yeah?
"That's a lot of fun,"
"but, uh, my parents are pretty big sailors, too,"
they're kind of into it.
"Uh, all we, all we have up here mostly bass boats."
"Oh, yeah,"
"I guess it's pretty, uh, fishing's a pretty big thing, huh?"
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Lot of, lot of fishing going on up here."
Yeah.
All right.
"So, where about in Texas is that?"
Is that centrally located
"or,"
"It's, uh, well,"
you ever heard of Lufkin?
"Uh, no,"
"what, what major city is nearby?"
Houston.
"Okay,"
and that's south or north of there or something?
"Uh, in fact, I'm in the middle of a project right now making a bed for my son."
Um. What kind of
"It's, uh,  It's, uh, it's, uh, plywood, uh, face, I guess."
pine?
But I cut it out in the shape of a crayon box
"and then I painted, uh, about eight different, uh, colors, uh, you know,"
"the crayons that are sticking up, it will be the headboard"
Uh-huh.
I guess he's young.
"and then,"
yes
He's about five and a half years old.
"Oh, he'll be delighted."
"Oh, yeah."
Uh-huh.
Now I just have to finish it though.
"I got, uh, it got delayed for a little bit and, uh, because of work"
"and now, uh, I've got to jump back in and finish the,"
"because I've got it all cut out,"
"it's all, uh,"
I've done most of the coloring
but I've got to go a second layer with the yellow.
Did you do it with a jigsaw
"or do you have powered, you know, a,"
"Uh, yeah."
"Uh, I did, uh, jigsaw, uh, and the, uh, regular straight saw for some of it."
Um.
So yeah.
"to do the, uh, the turn cut."
"Uh, how about yourself?"
"Well I'm, I am interested in woodworking."
I don't have lots of tools.
"those those are,"
"we'd, I've done one,"
I helped somebody do one of those before.
"Those are, those are, you know,"
you can buy them in kits
but we didn't do that way.
"But it's,"
No
I designed it from scratch and did it  did a pretty good job.
Yeah.
Those are nice.
"They're pretty forgiving, you know."
You can always tear stuff out and redo it.
"It's a,"
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"That's not near, like building a house or anything"
"but,"
"Yeah,"
those are nice.
"Especially when you get done, you've got something, you know."
"I don't know,"
I like them.
You just sit down on on the deck and do whatever. Have  a barbecue
Yeah.
"I  I built it two levels and with a big toy box and some benches and, uh, a backrest and all that stuff."
"or,"
"I,"
"Yeah,"
that sounds nice.
"All done by yourself, huh?"
I had  a friend with a tractor who dug the pier holes
"and then, uh, and then you, and then you pass it on."
Yeah.
"It seems to be catching on, uh, slowly but surely, I guess"
Yeah.
"And, uh, my little boy has, watches a program that was really neat."
I sat and watched him.
You know the Barney?
"You know the little, I don't know if you know the little character Barney."
Uh-huh.
"They had one, uh, on that kind of, type of thing"
"and how children can, can do that"
and how to save water when you brush your teeth in water
and it's really caught on
and he's only four
and he's really caught on.
Uh-huh.
"Wow,"
that's cute.
"That's neat,"
yeah.
"When you,"
And keep the refrigerator door closed and that kind of thing.
He's really caught on
so that's really neat
"Well, when you start early, I guess,"
Hi.
How are you doing?
"What,"
I couldn't hear you?
"I said, how are you doing?"
I'm doing fine.
"I'm, uh, just editing a spreadsheet right now."
"But he's in a box, right?"
"No,"
"no,"
"no,"
"in fact, it's funny."
"He never did, does come in out of a box, I don't think."
"Yeah,"
he was just kind of walking around.
Didn't he used to?
Not really.
He was always in the box before.
Oh.
"Oh, that's, yeah, that's, okay."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
that's what I was thinking.
"Well, do you do any recycling?"
"Uh, we do here."
"Uh, see, what do we recycle?"
"We, they recycle,"
they have bins
Yeah.
"and they also have centers where you can take aluminum cans and, uh, plastic bottles"
and I think that's all they have.
Oh.
What about you guys?
"Well, we, uh,"
"there is a lot of things that you can recycle down here, although the only thing I guess I wind up recycling religiously is, uh, aluminum cans."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, we've got a, we've got a couple of different things, uh, places, uh,"
they're like unattended aluminum can smashers
"And you can go up there and, and, uh, redeem,"
"You know, if, if you really wanted a gun, you, you could make one. Uh,"
Uh-huh.
"And I think if they want one, they're going to get one."
"Oh, you know"
You know.
true.
That's true.
"The bad guys are, you know,"
"like I say, if they want a gun they're going to find out somehow to get one."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"it's,"
"yeah,"
"I mean,"
yeah
"there's, there's no way to stop, uh, stop anybody from getting a gun."
"Uh, I think there should be more control as, like, uh, like maybe waiting periods and things like that, you know, uh,"
"Well I agree with you on that because I know, uh,"
in fact I had bought my son a rifle like for a Christmas present one time.
Uh-huh.
And for a rifle there's no waiting.
There wasn't anyhow.
Now there might be now.
Yeah.
"But there wasn't anything for, you know, rifles and things like that."
Uh-huh.
"I guess  it was just handguns that there was a, some kind  of a waiting, you know, two weeks while they checked you out or something."
Sure.
Yeah.
Right.
"But, uh, most of these people that's got these guns that's going around, you know, robbing people and shooting people,"
Yeah.
If it could just be spread out a little bit.
Right.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
Yeah.
"It has really been nice here, uh,"
"we are supposed to have some rain this weekend,"
but I don't know if we'll get it or not.
A lot of times in our area the weather forecast has missed us.
"The, the weather they forecast for our area seems to go right past us and misses us. Just by, well not too many miles."
Uh-huh.
Are you in an agricultural area?
"Yes,"
uh-huh.
"We have,"
"Well, I know the I know the weather is very important for people who make their living off of, off of the land."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
Yeah.
We have quite a few farmers.
"We, we live out in the country."
"We are on a farm,"
but we are not a farming person
Uh-huh.
"Uh, we have a garden."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, but we are not farmers."
Huh.
"Well, you know there are some disadvantages to being down south."
Uh-huh.
"And that is, it gets so hot that, you know, a lot of things die during the Summer from the heat."
"And, uh, there's a lot of things that I see that are so obviously wrong. That you would think it would be easy to correct."
Uh-huh.
Right.
But the system doesn't allow for the corrections
Uh-huh.
How about you?
"Well, that's interesting."
"I have a sister who used to live in Kennesaw, Georgia."
"Oh, yes."
"And, uh, she has a young boy. Actually has two boys now but only had one when she was there."
And she complained quite a bit about their school system there.
Yes.
"And,"
And Cobb County is better than the county I'm in.
Right.
She was in Cobb County.
Right.
"I'm,"
I can't really say much about the schools up here.
I really don't come from here
Uh-huh.
I'm only up here temporarily on an internship
"but  uh, I live in Orlando, Florida usually."
Okay.
"And the schools down there, from what I know, are not bad."
They're pretty good.
"Well, that's great."
"But I know that in some, I know in a lot of rural areas they're not that good."
Uh-huh.
"For example, I have a brother in North Carolina"
"and he says the schools there are, are incredibly bad. Uh, just terrible."
"Well, I feel that we're way behind."
Really.
Yeah.
What have you been to lately?
"Um, let's see."
"Well, uh, this is almost, sort of funny."
"I was just um,"
"friend and I went to see OUT FOR JUSTICE which is Steven Segal, because, uh, we're both big karate fans."
Yeah.
"Oh, yeah."
So we wanted to see what this is like.
"And, uh, impressed with actually."
Is that right?
"Yeah,"
"I wasn't, I mean, I've seen his other movies,"
and I just think he's pretty good.
Yeah.
"But, uh, this movie,"
I'm convinced now he can act.
Uh-huh.
How's his karate?
"Oh, his, his, his karate is pretty good."
I think in this one it wasn't so good.
"I generally, um,"
"movies like that scare me, though."
"I'd be just fine without them, because, you know, kids come running out wanting to beat each other up."
"Well, well they do,"
they get
Fighting.
"I remember when we used to go to see, well I remember when GRAND PRIX came out when I was a kid, and some other movies like that."
We wanted to jump in the cars and race.
Right.
And I suspect today what they see is bound to be what they want to do when they get out of it.
"and,"
"Yeah,"
that's easy.
"I always like to have that, too."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Everybody seems to like that, too."
"I know,"
I don't think I've ever met anyone that didn't.
"No,"
everybody likes that.
Yeah.
"And, then, uh, if you have a nice big roast that you can throw in the oven, then you can put your potatoes and carrots or whatever else all in there, you know. Especially if a pork roast."
"Oh, yeah."
"That's what I love, with my"
"I like it, too."
"I do, too."
"And, uh, other than that, in fact, I'm just thinking of what next weekend when the Super Bowl's on"
Uh-huh.
I've asked a couple people to come over
"and I just, uh, had been thinking what to have for that"
Yeah.
"Well, have you had any good ideas yet?"
No
not yet
"Oh, okay."
"No,"
"and I, you know, I don't want to have to come away from the T V."
I want something that I can just take them and serve them while they're sitting in front of the T V.
Yeah.
"You know, so, I'll think of something, just that we can munch on over there, you know."
Yeah.
"and it has not, really. Which is a bit of a disappointment."
"But it is very warm here, which is typical for this part of the, time of the year."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
How about
"I think you are, I think you are earlier than we are, as a rule, aren't you?"
"Your, your, your growing Summer starts a lot earlier than ours."
"It starts in, uh, March as a rule."
Uh-huh.
"See that is quite a bit,"
we are just beginning.
"People are, have got their gardens in, a lot of them now."
We could still have a frost.
"Really,"
this late?
Uh-huh.
Could you have snow?
"Uh, probably not."
"But we have had, we have had a frost as late as, as in June."
"Oh, well, we do not have that problem"
Early June.
"So, but we have also had nice weather. An unusually, uh, nice Spring."
It is almost like an early Summer for us.
"Oh, that is nice."
Uh-huh.
"We could use a little more rain, I believe."
"Uh, well, we will be glad, I will be glad to give you some of ours"
Uh
"Usually we get it in, in great quantities in April and May."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And then it stops for three months.
and the they like it all right.
Yeah.
"And, um, then sometimes we do something,"
"it has to be fast because they're on their way to school,"
"we do like Eggo waffles and stuff like that,"
but.
"Oh, uh-huh,"
yeah.
"Yeah,"
"so, I try to, uh,"
and sometimes we do eggs if I get up early enough to do that.
"I used to do them in the microwave,"
but they don't like that.
"Oh, do they get rubbery,"
"or,"
Um.
I've never tried it.
It it depends.
If you let them cook too long then they'll turn a little bit gray.
Uh-huh.
You can tell if they've gone to long because they'll turn a little bit gray
"and they will be a little harder,"
and I don't like that.
Yeah.
"So you have to just let it cook a little bit less than what it says in, if you have a microwave book,"
"but you cook it a little bit less and then let it sit with a, like a plate over the top."
Oh.
And let it steam.
Uh-huh.
"And then, and then stir it up."
Huh.
"Yeah,"
"Designed,"
"so we could pour concrete and support it with a, a nice firm four by four posts."
"And, uh and then the rest of it I just did."
Yeah.
"A, a contractor friend helped me, uh, with some of the, uh, foundation work"
"but, uh, it was pretty,"
it was about four or five hundred square feet.
The same size as the addition that I just put on
so.
Yeah.
"That's pretty, that's a good size deck."
Yeah.
"So, yeah."
"That's,"
"It's, uh, not that expensive."
"I think it cost me three dollars a square foot and, uh, you know, no less than that."
Yeah.
"That's not,"
"cost me about five hundred dollars, six hundred dollars all together."
"Yeah,"
that's good.
That's not bad at all.
"Didn't  have to,"
Yeah.
the wood may
"it got surprising as to the fact that how much wood is, you know."
"To get, to get good lumber it costs,"
"I don't know about Dallas, but even in this little town, it's, it's not cheap at all."
I was surprised.
"I'd be surprised if it wasn't, uh, cheaper where you are."
It's probably more there.
"Well, yeah."
"and he said take it home and bring it back if you want to,"
and I never did.
I just went back and signed the papers
and I knew nothing about my car when I got it.
Nothing.
I didn't know how anything worked.
"Well, so it was a completely new experience for you."
And I'm sure you enjoyed every minute of it.
Yeah.
"And I've had it,"
it's almost three years actually.
"And I've, I still love it."
I put the top down everywhere I go.
I timed it when I first got it
and it took twenty I mean twenty seconds
"and so, I figured there was nowhere I was to late to go that I didn't have twenty more seconds."
Right.
So.
"And, and you couldn't get,"
how long does it take to go back up? About the same time.
"Twenty seconds,"
yeah.
That's all it takes.
"I mean, it's just a button, that's it."
"You  release it right at the top,"
"Yeah,"
so
so you don't have to  get out or anything.
"So you won't get,"
Yeah
and twenty seconds you probably won't get caught in anything too substantial.
"Well I did, actually."
"Yeah,"
I drink beer.
"have you noticed that, um, that a lot of the, um, a lot of ..."
"Yeah,"
whiskey is in liters.
Yes.
"And, and the next,"
"yeah,"
"point seven five liters and then liters and then one point seven five liters,"
yeah.
"It's like a fifth, like fifths of whiskey I thought was always kind of strange."
Yeah.
What's a fifth of whiskey?
Yeah.
"I, I always wondered about that myself."
It was a marketing ploy.
"And, and they had quarts at the same time though."
Yeah.
"But the idea was, is that by, with five fifths, um, they could, uh, they could, uh, they could sell five"
"and, and, um, it was simply a ploy to, to get people, you know to buy, to buy more for,"
Yeah.
"it's, uh, I find that interesting."
It's ...
"But it's like, you know, the, the, the, the soda and this kind of things coming in one liter bottles"
Liters.
"and, um, I, I think it's kind of generational."
Yeah.
"It, it's, like I say, I work in a machine shop"
"and, uh, everything's still inches."
"Everything's still fractions of inches, or or tenths  or thousandths, or, or ..."
Yeah.
"It's, it's hard to think  though."
"Oh, I think, I don't think so."
"I, I think that, uh, I think they've now just taken the attitude that, well, if it happens, if it,"
"because it, there a lot of things that, that, uh, um, like sports, you know."
It's a hundred meter.
"Oh, absolutely."
"And, uh, uh, but automobile races"
"if it,"
"I don't think they'd ever,"
it's still going to be the Indianapolis Five Hundred.
They're not going to ...
"Yeah,"
Yeah.
They're not going to change that to meters.
It will always be.
Yeah.
"And, and it, I, I don't think it, I don't, you know, I don't think, I don't think it's particularly bothersome because in reality, uh,"
"you, it's like troy ounces in ounces of gold."
"How many ounces of gold, you know."
Twelve.
"I was trying, I was trying to figure up gold content on something."
"It had, has, uh, gold plated, uh, header."
"And, and they're trying to think of what's a Troy ounce."
Yeah.
There's twelve troy ounces to the pound.
Yeah.
"Now that makes, you know."
Yeah.
"And, and is that going to change too?"
"Well, I mean, and, and then there's a metric ton"
and then there's a ton.
But what's a metric ton?
"Uh,"
and they have nothing to gain one way or the other.
"So if they say a certain way, then why not believe them."
Right.
"And I don't know all the details on that,"
"but I certainly think that we've come up with a good idea with the, the the students coming into the jury."
Yeah.
And I don't think that it would be such a bad idea even if the judge didn't have the final say.
Uh-huh.
Do you have any?
"Yes,"
we do have a pet.
"We have a, a dog that we got from the, uh,"
"well, we call it the S P C A."
"It's the, uh, from an animal shelter."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, he'd come in there as a stray."
All right.
"Uh, he's a Pomeranian and Sheltie cross."
Yeah.
"Uh, well, he was very well trained when we got him."
"Uh, he's,"
"Oh, that's good."
"You don't often find that,"
I don't think.
"No, uh,"
"we suspect that he was hurt in an accident, you know, got away from somebody traveling through, and hurt in an accident because a dog that looks as good as he does and is trained as well is someone that has lost him and not have been able to locate him."
Right.
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, if they were local people, they would have been able to find him."
Sure.
"There's a,"
"okay, uh,"
you could probably do that.
"Or is it,"
I've talked about adding at least one more room and definitely adding another bath on.
Yeah
"I would think so if you only have one bathroom for three bedrooms,"
that's tough.
"Do you not, like, have a half bath."
Not even a half bath.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's rough.
The house that I used to live in had one bath and a half.
And that was even just with two people.
That was a pain.
"The only thing that saves it, with the schedule I work and the schedule my wife works, we're getting ready to go to work at totally different times. So that. It's not like we're tripping over each other in the morning."
That's good.
Really.
That could account for a lot of marital problems I think
You get to know each other very well if you have to share a bathroom
It doesn't work if you're trying to shave and she's trying to put her eyeliner on
"and,  you're both fighting over the mirror."
No.
That's right.
It does not make for a happy situation.
That's true.
"Well, do you have any children?"
I've got one.
One child.
And they enjoy where they're living?
"We'll,"
he's nine months old.
"Oh, so he doesn't know, right."
"Sickle pomfrets are common bycatch in pelagic fisheries. They are often caught near seamounts. They are a minor commercially landed species. Sickle pomfrets are known as ""monchong"" in Hawaii, where they are popular in restaurants."
"Sickle pomfrets have a widely forked tail, with a clear to white trailing edge. The body shape is compressed laterally, and they have a very rounded facial profile. Their pelvic fins are small and dark black, with a small brilliant, opalescent white tip. Juvenniles of this species have a single prominent raised nub in the each scale along the sides of the body."

"""I Give You My Heart"" (sometimes called ""Lord, I Give You My Heart"" or ""This is My Desire"") is a 1995 song by Reuben Morgan, who wrote both the music and the lyrics.

""I Give You My Heart"" is a devotional song , part of the contemporary worship music genre, and also a slow ballad."
"In the liner notes of ""God is in the House"", Morgan said of this song: ""The heart of GOD is for us to be completely sold out to HIM. Our thoughts, passions and dreams (everything that makes us who we are) only have true life as they become HIS to shape and to mould. As we give our heart and our soul to GOD we then walk in the endless riches that are found in intimacy with HIM."""

Mining companies provided a good market for his beef. Although Ellis claimed all of that land as his own, much of the land that his cattle roamed on was not actually owned by him, but he built up his empire based on grazing rights."
"In the 1890s, Ellis arrived in the Mission Valley and purchased a pioneer ranch. Ellis' ranch had three stacks of premium hay in the yard. When he brought up his cattle he found two-thirds of his premium hay had burned. In the following investigation and trial, Arthur Booth (A.B.) Knox was found guilty of arson, although there was much doubt from early Kelowna residents as to whether he actually burned the hay."

The boat only lasted a short time before Ellis and Thomas Shorts sold the boat to Leon Lequime for five thousand dollars in 1892."

"Charles Bodinier (6 January 1844 - 1911) was a French theater manager. After working for the Comédie-Française he became director of the Théâtre d'Application and then of the Théâtre La Bodinière. La Bodinière appealed to an elite audience, and staged a variety of lectures and performances until Bodinier retired in 1902."
"Charles Bodinier was born on 6 January 1844 in Beaufort-en-Vallée, Maine-et-Loire."
"He became a professional soldier, and was captured in the war of 1870."
He was not released until 1874. In 1876 he joined the staff of the Comédie-Française.
Bodinier was Secretary-General of the Comédie-Française from 1882 to 1889.
"In 1886 Bodinier proposed to establish a small theater where the students of the Conservatoire could stage performances of the Classics, a concept that was well received by the Minister of Fine Arts."
"In his application to the ""Commission des Auteurs et Compositeurs Dramatiques"" Bodinier insisted that the Théâtre d'Application would be a school and not a profit-making enterprise, and on that basis he was given permission for six months."
Both the municipal council and the ministry subscribed to establishing the theater.
In 1887 Bodinier opened the Théâtre d'Application in an old tannery at 18 rue Saint-Lazare for use by students at the Conservatoire de Paris.
He became director of the theater in 1888.
"The foyer of the premises were used as an art gallery. The artists Jules Chéret, Ferdinand Bac and Théophile Steinlen had their first one-person shows there while the main room was being used for the Théâtre d'Application."
"The original purpose evolved. The theater at 18 rue Saint-Lazare became known as ""La Bodinière"" and began to be used for different purposes."
La Bodinière's audience came to include members of the Parisian upper class and intelligentsia.
"Starting in 1890, Bodinier began to put on ""matinées-causeries"", where well-known literary figures gave talks."
He also staged plays and shadow shows.
A popular format was a combined lecture with a recital that illustrated the topic.
Charles Bodinier abandoned the theater in 1902 and left philosophically to spend in a quiet retirement in the suburbs.
He died in 1911 aged 67.

= = = Brent W. Jeffs = = =
"Brent W. Jeffs is an author, advocate, and member of the influential Jeffs family in the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church)."
"Jeffs wrote the memoir ""Lost Boy"" along with author Maia Szalavitz, which was released on May 19, 2009. The book is a depiction of life within the FLDS Church and his ostracism from the organization at a young age. The title of the book comes from the term ""the lost boys"", which refers to the many young men expelled from the FLDS Church. Jeffs is a grandson to FLDS ""prophet"" Rulon Jeffs, nephew to imprisoned FLDS ""prophet"" Warren Jeffs and Lyle Jeffs, and his mother is the daughter of another non-FLDS ""prophet"" as well."
"Jeffs was born to Ward Jeffs, son of Rulon Jeffs. Ward had three wives, two of whom were sisters. Between these marriages, Brent had nineteen siblings. Ward eventually left the church, leaving Brent in the FLDS community per Brent's request. Eventually, Brent left the compound and moved into a small apartment with four of his older brothers, where they experimented with alcohol, drug use and partying."
"In 2004 Jeffs named Warren Jeffs as the perpetrator in a civil lawsuit seeking damages for sexual abuse he had suffered as a boy. ""Lost Boy"" depicts much of the sexual abuse that was inflicted upon him beginning at ages 5 or 6. The memoir also includes abuse from Warren's brothers and other family members."
"Jeffs has appeared on the NPR radio show, ""Fresh Air"", hosted by interviewer Teri Gross, the television show ""Polygamy: What Love Is This?"", ""Hannity"" and ""Dr. Phil"", with each appearance having to do with the FLDS and polygamy. In each appearance Jeffs discusses the dangers of the FLDS lifestyle and abuse from Warren Jeffs and other influential FLDS Church leaders."
"Since releasing his memoir, Jeffs has married and had a daughter. They live in Salt Lake City, Utah."

"""No Good Advice"" is a song by British girl group Girls Aloud, taken from their debut album ""Sound of the Underground"" (2003). The song was written by Aqua's Lene Nystrøm Rasted, Miranda Cooper, Brian Higgins and his production team Xenomania, and produced by Higgins and Xenomania. It has themes of rebellion, reflecting Higgins' general mood of failure after a business partnership fell through."
"Following the overwhelming success of Girls Aloud's debut single ""Sound of the Underground"", the group waited five months until May 2003 before releasing the follow-up. The song cemented their success when it peaked at number two in Ireland, Scotland and on the UK Singles Chart. ""No Good Advice"" performed moderately elsewhere, reaching the top forty in the Netherlands, the top fifty in Belgium and peaking at number 88 in Australia."
"The music video features Girls Aloud dressed in futuristic silver outfits and hologram effects. ""No Good Advice"" was promoted through various live performances and has since been performed on Girls Aloud's first three concert tours. Described as ""a disco track with guitar"", the song has heavy 1980s influences. The track was lauded by many contemporary music critics, who deemed it a worthy sequel to its predecessor and praised Higgins' production."
"Musically, the song was labelled ""a disco track with guitar - a cross between Blondie and The Bangles."" The song was written in the key of Bb minor. The song consists of a verse followed by a bridge and chorus. In place of a middle 8, there is a guitar solo instead. The song ends with a spoken outro."
"Originally written for Miranda Cooper under the pseudonym Moonbaby, ""No Good Advice"" seems to be about a rebellious girl who doesn't need ""no good advice"" and does things independently. However, according to an interview for ""The Guardian"" in July 2004, Brian Higgins said that the song reflected his general mood of failure after a special deal between Xenomania and London Records fell through in 2000, and about persisting in spite of what people told him to do or not to do. The song's chorus originally began with the phrase ""I don't like fried rice"". ""No Good Advice"" was sung over a rave backing track, until different Xenomania musicians were asked to contribute new backing tracks. Higgins was inspired by indie rock. He stated, ""pop music was on its backside and indie music was about to rise [...] The guitar riff on No Good Advice is very very similar to the riff on the track Michael by Franz Ferdinand."""
"Brian Higgins said that Girls Aloud initially didn't like the song - ""we played them some of it, and they said: 'That's not our sound.' I objected to the use of that phrase 'our sound'. I told them they had five minutes to talk about whether or not they wanted to continue with me. They went away and spoke about it and since then it's been fine. They come in expecting to work, and there's a trust there which, I think, dates back to that day."""

"The ""Sisu"" class motor torpedo boats () was a series of two Italian M.A.S. type motor torpedo boats of the Finnish Navy. The vessels were constructed in 1916 by the Orlando shipyard in Livorno, Italy. ""Sisu"" and ""Hurja"" were purchased by the Finns in 1920, and saw service in World War II. When dashing forward at full speed, the vessels sprayed water high in the air, earning the nickname ""the fountains"" from Finnish sailors."
"On 1 October 1941 ""Sisu"", together with ""Nuoli"", was patrolling east of Gogland when it came across a large, stationary Soviet minesweeper of the ""Fugas"" class. ""Sisu"" missed with her first torpedo, having mistaken the foam painted on the minesweeper's bow for an indication that it was actually moving. A second torpedo hit the minesweeper amidship and sank her."

"The 8-demicubic honeycomb, or demiocteractic honeycomb is a uniform space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb) in Euclidean 8-space. It is constructed as an alternation of the regular 8-cubic honeycomb."
"It is composed of two different types of facets. The 8-cubes become alternated into 8-demicubes h{4,3,3,3,3,3,3} and the alternated vertices create 8-orthoplex {3,3,3,3,3,3,4} facets ."
"The vertex arrangement of the 8-demicubic honeycomb is the D lattice. The 112 vertices of the rectified 8-orthoplex vertex figure of the ""8-demicubic honeycomb"" reflect the kissing number 112 of this lattice. The best known is 240, from the E lattice and the 5 honeycomb."
formula_1 contains formula_2 as a subgroup of index 270. Both formula_1 and formula_2 can be seen as affine extensions of formula_5 from different nodes:
"The D lattice (also called D) can be constructed by the union of two D8 lattices. This packing is only a lattice for even dimensions. The kissing number is 240. (2 for n<8, 240 for n=8, and 2n(n-1) for n>8). It is identical to the E8 lattice. At 8-dimensions, the 240 contacts contain both the 2=128 from lower dimension contact progression (2), and 16*7=112 from higher dimensions (2n(n-1))."
"The D lattice (also called D and C) can be constructed by the union of all four ""D8 lattices"": It is also the 7-dimensional body centered cubic, the union of two 7-cube honeycombs in dual positions."
"The kissing number of the D lattice is 16 (""2n"" for n≥5). and its Voronoi tessellation is a quadrirectified 8-cubic honeycomb, , containing all trirectified 8-orthoplex Voronoi cell, ."
There are three uniform construction symmetries of this tessellation. Each symmetry can be represented by arrangements of different colors on the 256 8-demicube facets around each vertex.

"St. Catharine High School is an all-girls, private, Roman Catholic high school in the Bronx, New York. It is located within the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York."
"The Sisters of Mercy, founded by Mother Catherine McAuley in Dublin, Ireland, opened an academy in the Washington Heights section of New York City in September 1889. The classes included were grades 1 through 12. At that time, the first academy resembled the large estates which surrounded it. Toward the end of the 19th century as registration increased, the Sisters erected a new building across the street at 539 West 152nd Street. In 1900 the University of the State of New York granted a Regents charter to the school."
The rapid growth of the area and the great increase in enrollment showed the inadequacy of the accommodations. The elementary grades in the academy were discontinued and these classrooms were used for high school students.

A slice knot is a type of mathematical knot.
"In knot theory, a ""knot"" means an embedded circle in the 3-sphere"
and that the 3-sphere can be thought of as the boundary of the four-dimensional ball
"A knot formula_3 is slice if it bounds a nicely embedded 2-dimensional disk ""D"" in the 4-ball."
"What is meant by ""nicely embedded"" depends on the context, and there are different terms for different kinds of slice knots. If ""D"" is smoothly embedded in ""B"", then ""K"" is said to be smoothly slice. If ""D"" is only locally flat (which is weaker), then ""K"" is said to be topologically slice."
The following is a list of all slice knots with 10 or fewer crossings; it was compiled using the Knot Atlas:
"6, formula_4, formula_5, formula_6, formula_7, formula_8, formula_9, formula_10, formula_11, formula_12, formula_13, formula_14, formula_15, formula_16, formula_17, formula_18, formula_19, formula_20, formula_21, formula_22 and formula_23."
Every ribbon knot is smoothly slice.
An old question of Fox asks whether every slice knot is actually a ribbon knot.
The signature of a slice knot is zero.
The Alexander polynomial of a slice knot factors as a product formula_24 where formula_25 is some integral Laurent polynomial. This is known as the Fox–Milnor condition.

= = = Kong Jie = = =
Kong Jie (; born 25 November 1982) is a Chinese professional Go player.
"Kong Jie turned professional in 1994 at the age of 12. He was promoted to 7-dan after eight years in 2001. In 2004 he was sent into the Teda Cup as China's representative against Lee Chang-ho and Yoda Norimoto. Kong Jie is China's 29th professional 9-dan, doing so by being runner-up in the 13th Samsung Cup, and entering the finals of the Asian TV Cup for the first time. In 2009, Kong Jie achieved a major international breakthrough by winning the Asian TV Cup—defeating Korea's top three players of Lee Sedol, Lee Chang-ho and Kang Dongyun respectively. His win marked the end of several years of poor personal international results. Later in the year, Kong Jie followed up by reaching the semi-finals of the 14th Samsung Cup and won the title by defeating his two compatriots Gu Li and Qiu Jun."
"In 2010, Kong Jie passed the preliminary rounds of the 14th LG Cup to face former champion Lee Chang-ho in the finals. Kong won the match 2–0 and also the tournament. Later in the year, Kong Jie successfully defended his Asian TV Cup, defeating Korea's Lee Chang-ho and Japan's Yuki Satoshi. He followed that with another big win over a red hot Lee Sedol, to win the 23rd Fujitsu Cup. He arguably cemented his status as the 2010 world's strongest Go player. In 2011, Kong overcame compatriot Meng Tailing to again reach the LG Cup Final, but was unable to defend his title against another compatriot, Piao Wenyao, thus allowing the latter to win his first world title and be promoted to 9-dan professional on the merit of winning a world championship."
"This was the last international final Kong played in. Within the next few years, with the rise of new 1990s generation professionals and the increased competition at the international level, only Gu Li and Lee Sedol would continue to have high tournament placings in big international tournaments. During the 15th Samsung Cup, Kong defeated a soon to be wedded Lee Chang-Ho before succumbing to Kim Ji-Seok in the quarterfinals. The match, with Kong playing Black, turned out to be a crucial ""fight to the death"" of both sides' dragons, but Kong miscalculated a combination by Kim on move 150, and on move 202, resigned, thus failing to defend his crown."
Kong Jie is considered to be an expert at life and death problems. In China he is known as the King of Tsumego (King Kong).
"King's latest record is another solo effort, released independently, and features King on a broad range of instruments, including cello, drums, keyboard, bass, and guitar. In addition to playing all the instruments, King engineered and produced the record. His Myspace page announced the title of the new album as ""Humilitas Occidit Superbiam"", and it was subsequently released digitally in November 2009."
"Justin has admitted to have spent ""more than his means"" on his gear. The following list includes some of his acoustic guitars, as well as the electric guitars he has owned and performed with."
"Justin first approached Mike Doolin, an innovative luthier with an excellent reputation, to build a double-neck steel-string guitar. Justin wanted a guitar with two identical DADGAD-tuned necks to expand on his unique two-handed tapping style. The challenge was to design an instrument that could handle 340 pounds of string tension and yet still be acoustically responsive. The instrument features many of Doolin's innovations, including a pinless bridge, and adjustable neck angles. Doolin and King chose an instrument with a modified jumbo-style body, cocobolo (rosewood) back and sides, and a redwood top. The redwood is incredibly strong and stable, while at the same time being dynamic and possessing a rich acoustic tone. They also decided on using B-Band acoustic pickups, which are known for their excellent fidelity. The result is an unprecedented instrument, completely unique, with a wonderful tone. This can be seen on the song ""Knock on Wood"" and ""Crown"" (unofficial title)."

"Stempniak graduated from St. Francis High School in Athol Springs, New York, in 2001, and played his college hockey at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. A well-traveled and versatile forward, Stempniak has played for ten different teams in his NHL career, which is tied for the second-most in NHL history. On October 1, 2019 after 14 seasons in the NHL he announced his retirement."
"Stempniak lived near an ice hockey rink where he knew the owner would let him practice whenever he could. After high school, he wanted to continue to play hockey, but his parents wanted him to go to college. Stempniak went to the only college that showed interest in him, Dartmouth. At Dartmouth, he majored in economics. He became a top player for the Big Green ice hockey team and was named a two-time All American, as well as his team's captain."
"Stempniak was drafted by the St. Louis Blues in the fifth round, 148th overall, at the 2003 NHL Entry Draft. He led the team in goals in his first full season (2006–07), with 27, despite being just 23 years of age. He and David Backes joined Jay McClement to form one of the NHL's youngest lines."

In the 2015–16 season, Stempniak made a seamless transition to provide instant value to the Devils. In a scoring role, Stempniak was leading the Devils with 41 points in 63 games, having his best offensive season since 2010."
"Stempniak was traded for a third consecutive season at the trade deadline to the Boston Bruins in exchange for a second-round and fourth-round pick on February 29, 2016. Stempniak finished out the season scoring 10 points in 19 games."
"Unable to help the Bruins into the post-season, Stempniak familiarly approached the off-season as a free agent. Following a successful individual year, on July 1, 2016, Stempniak was promptly signed to a two-year contract to join his tenth NHL club, the Carolina Hurricanes."
"Stempniak joined the Boston Bruins during the start of training camp, signing a Professional Tryout (PTO) contract on September 10, 2018. Stempniak began the 2018–19 without a contract, however continued to train with the Bruins at times throughout the first months of the season. While continuing informally with the team, Stempniak belatedly signed a professional try-out contract in the AHL to join affiliate, the Providence Bruins, on February 15, 2019.

"In a painting by Édouard Manet in 1863, Olympia, the artist endeavoured to evoke an odalisque, who receives a bouquet of flowers brought by her maid. According to Phyllis A. Floyd's study, ""The Puzzle of Olympia"", he gave the painting the features of Marguerite Bellanger."
"In June 1863, while on a carriage ride in Saint-Cloud Park, Emperor Napoleon III spotted Bellanger sheltering from the rain beneath a tree. Napoleon was bewitched by his new encounter."
"Marguerite Bellanger become the mistress of the Emperor. Soon, with the knowledge of all including the Empress Eugénie, she followed him on private and official trips."
"Amongst his numerous presents, the Emperor gave her two houses, one at 57 rue des Vignes, Passy, the other at Saint-Cloud, in the park of Montretout, which had a back door to the gardens of the castle."
"In February 1864, Marguerite Bellanger gave birth to a son; whom she named Charles Jules Auguste François Marie Leboeuf."
"After the birth, Bellanger retired for a while to rue de Launay in Villebernier and received a pension. In November 1864, the Emperor offered ""Margot"" the castle of Villeneuve-sous-Dammartin, near Meaux. The Emperor also gave the child a boarding house and the castle of Mouchy, in the Oise, which he had bought very discreetly some time before. Bellanger became usufructuary of the property."
"Always seductive, Bellanger still attracted men when she settled in Villeneuve-sous-Dammartin at the end of 1864. Among her lovers were General de Lignières and, according to some sources, Léon Gambetta."
"She was the subject of caricatures and gossip. Paul Hadol, in his series of caricatures on the ""Imperial Menagerie"", portrayed her as a cat."
"Her affair with the emperor continued during the Franco-Prussian War, and even during his captivity in Westphalia. In 1873, when the emperor died in exile in England, she travelled to England to mourn her 'dear lord'."
"At the fall of the Empire, she again traveled to England and married William Louis Kulbach, a British army officer. The presence of the couple William Kulbach and Marguerite Bellanger is recorded in Monchy-Saint-Éloi (Oise), France in the census of 1872. Bellanger gave her age as 30 years, whereas according to the data in her biography, she was 33 or 34."
"She lived the rest of her life as a member of the upper class, devoting herself to charity and good works."
"Marguerite Bellanger died at the age of 48 on 23 November 1886 after contracting a cold during a walk in the park of the castle at Villeneuve-sous-Dammartin. According to the declaration of death, her husband lived in Pau. The religious ceremony took place on 27 November at the church of Saint-Pierre-de-Chaillot and she was interred in Montparnasse Cemetery."
"Her brother Jules, who served as a gardener, benefited from her estate. He built a beautiful house in Brain-sur-Allonnes, which is now the town hall."
"Her only son, Charles Leboeuf, made a career as an officer and died without issue on 11 December 1941. He was buried with his mother."
"Bellanger's character appears in Christian-Jaque's film Nana (1955), in which her character is performed by Nicole Riche."
"Marguerite Bellanger has been associated with a chocolate specialty: a praline was created to honour her. A chocolatier from Saumur designed, with the help of archivists of the city of Saumur, a specialty ""The Marguerite""."
"The coat of arms of Marguerite Bellanger is reproduced on the chocolates: a daisy with a heart of silver and gold petals. The praline ""with four spices"" (cloves, cinnamon, pepper and nutmeg) echos the qualities that the second Empire sought to give her: a varnish of heart, a spicy charm and an imperial dress."

He met Peter again in 1825, after writing in his diary about wanting to ""get from him some memoirs about my great-grandfather."" He seemed to use his own experiences, along with Gannibal's to create the plot for ""The Moor of Peter the Great"". A stage version of the work was written by Carlyle Brown and premiered at the Alabama Shakespeare Festival's 13th Southern Writers' Project in March 2001."
"Abram Gannibal is a protagonist of the Soviet comedy movie ""How Czar Peter the Great Married Off His Moor"", although the film's plot has almost nothing to do with Gannibal's real biography. The film is partly based on Pushkin's ""Moor of Peter the Great""."
"There are several portraits thought to depict Gannibal, which include a painting of the Battle of Lesnaya by Pierre-Denis Martin the Younger. The young boy present in Martin’s painting is argued to be Gannibal, because of the young boy’s role as valet to Peter during military campaigns and Gannibal’s possible connection to the artist while in France. A portrait by Adriaan Schoonebeeck is also believed to portray Gannibal during his time with Peter the Great. In Schoonebeeck’s portrait of Peter the Great, the young servant boy directly behind Peter is thought to be Gannibal. Although there are a variety of portraits that claim to contain Gannibal, there is little evidence to suggest the claims are accurate."

"Au made his debut in Hong Kong First Division League for Tin Tin on 20 December 1988, against Happy Valley. He was 17 years old at the time and the final result of the match 0–2."
"Au was the leading goal scorer of the Hong Kong team, but retired from international football after an exhibition match with Manchester United on 23 July 2005."
"On the pitch, Au was recognised easily by his hairstyle – he sports peroxide-blond streaks in his locks. He wore the number 7 jersey for South China and was the captain of the team."
"He is also remembered by his famous ""cross passing during 1-on-1"" in the final of 2002 Carlsberg Cup against Honduras. In the match, he received a pass from his teammate, and got a goal opportunity. However, he passed the ball back and did not shoot. Further jokes on this were developed after this incident."
"Being a veteran striker, Au is valued for his international experience and his strong aerial ability. The 6' tall striker remains one of the best headers in the League."
"In the 2005–06 season, his good performance throughout the season could not prevent South China from finishing 7th in the league, with 2 points below the relegation line. He scored 8 league goals that season (4th among all players, 1st among Hong Kong players). Two years after retiring, he chose to return and play for Eastern, one of his former clubs."
"In the summer of 2007, after being offered a new contract with a salary cut by South China, he decided to retire. He claimed that the entire squad received new contracts with increments, but he was the only one with a salary cut. He thought the club was being unfair to him, who contributed for many years, even when the team performed so poor for several seasons."

It has been historically referred to as both Little Cacapehon and Little Capecaphon. The name is pronounced or ."
"The Little Cacapon is formed at the confluence of two small streams, the North Fork Little Cacapon and the South Fork Little Cacapon, shortly after they both pass north under the Northwestern Turnpike (U.S. Route 50) at Frenchburg. From Frenchburg, the Little Cacapon flows north between Town Hill, high, to its west and Little Cacapon Mountain, high, to its east. Flowing from a hollow in Town Hill, Shawan Run feeds into the Little Cacapon at Barnes Mill. Two miles (3 km) north, Three Churches Run also feeds into the river from Town Hill. At Higginsville on Slanesville Pike (County Route 3) near the old Vinita School, the river is fed by Crooked Run at Queens Ridge ( high). From Higginsville, the Little Cacapon continues northeast along Town Hill with Noland Ridge bounding it to the east. Also in the vicinity of Higginsville, Little Cacapon-Levels Road (County Route 3/3) intersects with Slanesville Pike, and as its name suggests, the road follows the Little Cacapon north until it diverges northwest to Levels via Hoffman Hollow. It is within this stretch of the stream that the Little Cacapon meanders by the community of Creekvale. At the entrance of Neals Run, the Little Cacapon is met to its east by Spring Gap Mountain and then flows beneath the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and empties into the Potomac River."
"The North Fork is a tributary of the Little Cacapon. The North Fork's source lies in a hollow between Piney Mountain and the southwestern end of Stony Mountain. From its source, the North Fork flows northeast along Grassy Lick Road (County Route 10). South Branch Mountain ( high) joins the North Fork to its west, and along with Stony Mountain to its east, the river diverges from Grassy Lick Road and continues its northeastern route to Shanks where it meets US Route 50. From Shanks, the North Fork merges with Camp Run and flows east under US Route 50 at Frenchburg, where it merges with the South Fork to create the Little Cacapon River."
"The South Fork is an tributary of the Little Cacapon. The South Fork is formed at its headwater in a hollow towards the southeastern end of Stony Mountain along South Fork of Little Cacapon Road (County Route 12) between the communities of Kirby and Ruckman. From its source, the South Fork flows northeast toward Bell Hollow, where it meets US Route 50 and turns north through Frye's Flat towards Frenchburg. The South Fork continues north under US Route 50, where it immediately joins with the North Fork to form the Little Cacapon River alongside Little Cacapon River Road (County Route 50/9)."
Tributary streams are listed in order from south to north.

"The Maryland and Delaware Railroad operates on three segments of track throughout the Delmarva Peninsula. Each segment intersects the Delmarva Central Railroad, which interchanges with the Norfolk Southern Railway in Clayton, Delaware."
"MDDE provides an engine for the ""Hurlock Express"" at the annual Hurlock Fall Festival. Train rides during the one-day event, held on the first Saturday of October, run from the town of Hurlock's historic train station (built in 1867) to Federalsburg, along the MDDE's Seaford Line. The town of Hurlock owns the train station and two passenger cars."

"Priory Meadow Shopping Centre is a shopping centre in Hastings, East Sussex, England. The centre was opened in 1997 by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. The local radio station Arrow FM, which was founded in 1998, broadcasts from the centre."
"The building was built on the site of the Central Recreation Ground, which had originally opened in 1864 and had since remained the main cricket venue in the town. This history is reflected by the statue in Queens Square of a batsman holding a pose having played a shot (""The Spirit of Cricket"" by Allan Sly). The observant shopper will be able to spot the ball that this batsman has hit (it can be seen in the wall above F. Hinds jewellers)."
"The land on which the shopping centre now stands had been underwater before the 13th century, and was the original harbour for Hastings. A series of severe storms, silting and sea erosion forced the town to move to where the current old town is. The Priory Valley eventually silted up completely and the area became known as Priory Meadow and turned into farmland in 1536."
"In 1864 the Priory Marshes were levelled and drained and opened as a Cricket Ground, by 1932 one corner of the ground was leased by the Maidstone and District bus company to use as a coach station, then in 1958 a row of shops was built on one side of the ground with seating above."
"In 1982 Hastings Council voted for a shopping centre to be built on the cricket ground and to move cricket to Summerfields, now Horntye Park. In 1987, planning permission for 420,000sq.ft of space for shops was granted. Due to the onset of recession, developer Speyhawk pulled out. By May 1993, a new developer, Boots had been found and developed the existing shopping centre which was then sold to a private Irish investor and is managed by BTWShiells. A scheme of approx. 264,000sq ft now exists. In 1989 the ground hosted its last Sussex county game, when they beat Kent in front of a crowd of 1000 people."

"Grahame Park, located on the site of the old Hendon Aerodrome in North West London, is a north London housing estate in the London Borough of Barnet, including 1,777 council homes built in the 1970s."
"The estate is named in honour of Claude Grahame-White, the pioneer of aviation who established the original aerodrome and aviation school on the site."
"The building of the estate was a joint project between the Greater London Council and Barnet Council. The plan was approved by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government in 1964, and the first family moved in on 23 October 1971. Sir Roger Walters was the Chief Architect and Gordon Wigglesworth was the Housing Architect."
"A typical characteristic of the estate was the plain, square, brick terraced houses and long winding low-rise flats, with flat roofs, also known as ""Brick Brutalist"" style. Most building names, walkways and roads on the estate have names linked to the aviation history of the site."
Not all of the old aerodrome was sold off for development; the Royal Air Force Museum is situated immediately to the south-east of the estate (with free entrance).
"A secondary road called Grahame Park Way, a typical 1970s-style collector road, runs along the eastern margin of the estate, parallelling the Midland Main Line (Thameslink) railway, and beyond that, the M1 Motorway."
The estate became the sole site of St. James Catholic High School in 1996.
"London Underground Colindale station, on the Northern line Edgware branch, is within comfortable walking distance of at least the south-east corner of the estate. The next tube station north, Burnt Oak is also accessible. Mill Hill Broadway Thameslink station lies to the north, a bus ride away. Several bus routes run into or near the estate."
"In the late 1980s, the estate went through its first regeneration process, which split the blocks of flats into smaller blocks, by removing connecting walkways, and added pitched roofs to many of the buildings."
"In 2003, residents voted in favour of a full regeneration of the estate. The Housing Corporation earmarked £15 million for the redevelopment."
"The redevelopment is managed by Choices For Grahame Park, a subsidiary of Genesis Housing Association, with new houses being built by Countryside Properties."
"In 2007 a web-site was launched by Countryside Properties, renaming part of the redevelopment as ""New Hendon Village""."

"KZOO has been broadcasting continuously in Japanese since the station signed on October 18, 1963. It was not the first Japanese-language station in Honolulu (competitor KOHO/1170 signed on in 1959), but it is the only one still on the air today."
"The station has been owned by Polynesian Broadcasting since 1967, when businessman Noboru Furuya took over KZOO's operations. Furuya's son David and his wife Robyn took over management of the station in the mid-1990s when Furuya's health began to decline. Noboru Furuya died in 2002 at the age of 82; David and Robyn Furuya (now the president and vice-president, respectively, of Polynesian Broadcasting) continue to run KZOO today."
"Though most of their programs are broadcast from their offices at the Japanese Cultural Center of Hawaii, in 2011 KZOO began broadcasting special interviews from a studio in the Shirokiya in Ala Moana Shopping Center."
"KZOO's programs include news, talk shows, and Japanese music. Most of it is original programming, but some of the talk shows are from Japan."
"Many of KZOO's current on-air staff have been with the station for decades, including Keiko Ura, host of an Okinawan language show on Sundays, who joined the station in early 1964; Maki Norris, one of the hosts of a popular daily talk show called ""Moshi-Moshi Time,"" who has worked at KZOO since 1976; and Harumi ""Danny"" Oshita."
"KZOO has a history of sponsoring Japanese speech (""Nihongo Hanashikata Taikai"", started by announcer Keiko Ura in 1965) and nodojiman and karaoke song contests in Honolulu, with winners going on to represent Hawaii at contests in Japan. The station's broadcast day also includes simulcasts of programs from Japan as well as local talk and advice shows on a variety of topics, from health to the law."
"When KZOO was knocked off the air by the 2006 Kiholo Bay earthquake, the station's assistant general manager, Kaoru Ekimoto, contacted English-language adult contemporary music station KSSK, who put her on the air with disaster relief information in Japanese; the station also set up a hotline to answer listener questions. The station later added a backup generator for its transmitter."
= = = Angletarn Pikes = = =
Angletarn Pikes is a fell in the English Lake District near the village of Patterdale. Its most notable feature is the summit tarn from which it derives its name.
"Angletarn Pikes stands on the western arm of the long horseshoe ridge which surrounds the Martindale catchment, a system of valleys draining north into Ullswater. The adjacent fells on this ridge are Place Fell to the north and Brock Crags to the south. Beda Fell, a subsidiary ridge, also juts out into Martindale from Angletarn Pikes. This separates the heads of Boredale and Bannerdale."
"The western side above Goldrill Beck is steep and includes the faces of Dubhow and Fall Crags. The long eastern flank above Bannerdale is also pock-marked with crags, Heck Crag being the principal feature. The narrow north eastern slopes above Boredale, although steep, are less rocky and are cut by the upper ravine of Freeze Beck."
"North from the summit a long ridge drops over Stony Rigg (1,640 ft) to the walkers’ crossroads of Boredale Hause. From here paths run down to Hartsop, Patterdale and Boredale, while a further bridleway cuts across Beda Fell to Bannerdale. Boredale Hause carries the tiny ruin of a building named ‘Chapel in the Hause’ on OS maps. A mountain pass at 1,300 ft seems a curious place to construct a church. From the Hause a good path carries on northwards up Steel Edge to Place Fell."
"The north-east ridge to Beda Fell is also well defined, a fair path traversing a series of rocky knolls before the final rise to the summit, named Beda Head."
"Southward from Angletarn Pikes is Angle Tarn itself. This indented waterbody is about a quarter of a mile long with an island in the middle and forms a picturesque foreground for views of the Pikes. The tarn sits in a hollow on the centre of the ridge, issuing westwards through a break in the parapet via the ravine of Angletarn Beck. The ridge proper runs to the east of the tarn above the Bannerdale face, rising again to the unnamed 1,870 ft top above Satura Crag. This overtops the summit of Brock Crags, but was made subservient to it by Wainwright in his ""Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells""."
"Angletarn Pikes takes its plural from the two rocky towers at the summit, separated by perhaps 200 yards of peaty bog. The northern top is the true summit, the other being some six feet lower. The southern top is compensated by a clear view of Angle Tarn, described by Wainwright as ""among the best of Lakeland tarns"". The wider view stretches from the Helvellyn range to the spine of the Far Eastern Fells across Martindale."
"The fell can be climbed via Boredale Hause, making Patterdale, Bridgend, Hartsop and Boredale Head all possible starting points. An alternative is to climb from Martindale Old Church, ascending via the Beda Fell ridge or Angle Tarn. The route from Patterdale is often undertaken as the first section of the ascent of High Street."

"Liberator is an arcade game released by Atari, Inc. in 1982. It is based on the ""Atari Force"" comic book series published by DC Comics from 1982 to 1986. ""Liberator"" has been described as the opposite of ""Missile Command"", in that the player destroys cities from space instead of defending them from the ground. Only 762 arcade machines were ever made."
"The story ""Code Name: Liberator"" describes the premise of the arcade game in detail and was included as a special insert in two comic books cover dated January 1983. Characters and concepts from the comic exist throughout the game. In the opening screen of the arcade game, Commander Champion of the ""Atari Force"" asks the player to help free the galaxy from the evil Malaglon Army."
"The ""Liberator"" controls consist of a trackball, fire button, and shield button. The player controls a coordinated attack from four star ships at the corners of the screen. The primary target of the attack are enemy bases on a rotating planet in the center of the screen. The trackball is used to move a cross-shaped cursor. The fire button fires a missile at the cursor's location from the closest ship. The shield button is used to activate force fields around the ships. The shield can only take four hits each round, and the count is shared between all ships."
"At the beginning of each level, the player is flying through outer space and spaceships fly on screen from the left and right and leave in an arc. They try to ram into the player's ships. Shields do not work during this stage."
"After this stage, the player is taken to a view of a rotating planet. The most prominent enemies are red flashing missile bases. They shoot missiles, fireballs, and star balls at the player's ships. The enemy bases can also detach from the planet, turn into satellites, and orbit the planet while shooting missiles. Once all missile bases are destroyed, the player moves on to the next level. At higher levels, there is the white master base. It is very intelligent, and it can change the direction or speed of the planet rotation to avoid getting hit. At the end of each stage, the player is awarded a bonus ship for every 20,000 points."
"Missiles can be destroyed, although some split into four smaller particles when destroyed. Fireballs take four hits to destroy, but they slow down on each hit. Star balls also take four hits to destroy, but return to normal speed soon after being hit."
"Flying saucers sometimes appear from the planet. Flying saucers shoot a large, deadly laser which cannot be stopped."
"A level select menu allows the player to start at any third level (1, 4, 7... up to 22)."
"""Liberator"" was released for Microsoft Windows, Xbox, and PlayStation 2 in 2003 as part of ""Atari Anthology"", a collection of Atari arcade and 2600 games."
"1990 also saw the first international tournament—""RugbyFest"" held in Christchurch, New Zealand. As well as a variety of club sides, including teams from Japan (but not the Japanese national team), were four ""national"" teams—USA, New Zealand, USSR, and the Netherlands—who played a round-robin tournament. The winner was New Zealand, who then played—and beat—a combined ""World XV""."
"""Rugbyfest 1990"" pointed the way to the next big leap forward—the first women's rugby world cup, which took place in Wales the following year. Timed to coincide with the second men's world cup being held in England it did not meet with official approval from World Rugby (then known as the International Rugby Football Board), a decision which threatened the competition and was a factor in the New Zealand RFU not supporting their entry. However, this did not stop the New Zealanders from taking part—nor Wales, the United States, England, France, Canada, Sweden, USSR, Japan, Spain, Italy, and the Netherlands."
"The competition was run on a shoestring. Russian players sold souvenirs before and during matches to raise funds to cover their expenses, while four England administrators re-mortgaged their houses to cover the expenses of attending the competition. But after fifteen matches the first world champions were crowned—the United States, who beat England in the final. Despite the lack of support from the men's game, and very little media coverage, the competition had been a success, and the women's game continued to grow."
"In 1994 a second world cup was awarded to the Netherlands, but constant prevarication by the IRFB about whether they would (or would not) give the tournament official status caused huge problems for the hosts. Without IRFB support there was a fear that many unions would not send teams which would threaten the tournament (and even the Dutch union's) viability. In fact the IRFB went so far as to threaten sanctions against any unions did take part—thus ensuring that New Zealand, Sweden and Germany withdrew. Faced with this the risk of major losses was as too great and the Dutch withdrew both as hosts and participants with barely weeks to go."
"It was Scotland who stepped in to save the event with only 90 days to organise it. The second world cup was in the end a purely northern hemisphere affair with 11 remaining teams (consisting of the four home nations, France, the United States, Japan, Sweden, Russia, Canada and Kazakhstan) joined by a Scottish Students XV. The final was a repeat of 1991, but with this time England overcoming the United States 38–23, the final being played at Raeburn Place, Edinburgh. Despite everything, the tournament had been a success, and the game continued to grow."
In 1996 the IRFB established a Women's Advisory Committee which produced a five-year development plan for the game. One of its main targets was a 100% increase in player numbers by 2001. Elsewhere in the world...
"Widespread acceptance of the game led to women's versions of other major rugby union tournaments (the women's Five Nations begins in 1999), and growing numbers of headlines. In 2000 the Irish WRFU affiliated fully with the IRFU—but there were still set-backs. In 2002 the Australian RFU dropped support for the women's team's entry to the World Cup. The decision was seen as a factor in IOC rejection of rugby as an Olympic sport, and was reversed two years later."
But this was unusual. Women's teams were now being accepted on the main stage. In 2002 Scotland played their first women's match at Murrayfield and in 2003 England staged the first women's international at Twickenham.
"In 2006 the RFU devoted the rugby museum's main annual exhibition to the history of women's rugby—""Women's Rugby—A Work in Progress"", and the same year saw the Women's Rugby World Cup broadcast live on the internet."
"The growth in popularity among women attracted women in both developed and emerging nations, being the fastest growing sport in the world. The participation rates in both rugby sevens and rugby unions (with 15 players) has close to 500,000 new players joining every year globally. According to World Rugby, women's rugby is growing faster (if not as fast) as men's rugby and it is estimated that by 2026 40% of the total number of rugby players will be female. The game remains an amateur, minority sport—but a fast-growing one played in over 80 countries worldwide. Cost and player numbers mean that, in many of these nations, sevens tends to dominate, but 15-a-side championships have now been established in all regions."
"The highest profile women's rugby tournament is the Rugby World Cup, historically known as the Women's Rugby World Cup. The women's World Cup began in 1991, and has generally been played every four years. The most recent World Cup was held in Ireland in 2017, where New Zealand were the winners. In 2019, World Rugby announced that sex/gender designations would officially be removed from the title of the World Cup; the first tournament affected by this policy will be the next women's World Cup in 2021, to be hosted by New Zealand."
"The most successful nations in the World Cup have been New Zealand, which has won it five times, and England, which has reached the final seven times."
The primary annual global competition for women's rugby sevens is the World Rugby Women's World Series. The Women's Series was launched in the 2012-13 season. It features 4-6 tournaments each year.
"Women's rugby sevens at the Hong Kong Sevens has been dominated by New Zealand, with either the New Zealand team (1999–2001) or the Aotearoa Maori team (playing as New Zealand) winning the annual tournament from 1997 until 2007. The United States won the Hong Kong Sevens in 2008 by defeating Canada in the final (New Zealand failed to send a team)."
The inaugural Women's Rugby World Cup Sevens tournament took place in Dubai together with the men's tournament in 2009. Australia defeated New Zealand 15–10 in extra-time to become the first to win the Women's Rugby World Cup.
"Women's rugby sevens was included in World Rugby's successful bid to reintroduce rugby to the Olympics in 2016. At the 2016 Olympics, Australia defeated New Zealand in the final to win the gold medal."

During the works, the train from Solingen Hbf to Remscheid Hbf terminated at Solingen Mitte and a bus continued to Remscheid."
"Originally the bridge was named ""Kaiser-Wilhelm-Brücke"" (Emperor Wilhelm Bridge) to honour Emperor Wilhelm I. After the end of the monarchy the bridge was renamed after the nearby settlement of Müngsten, which is close to the city limits of Solingen, Remscheid and Wuppertal. Today, the settlement no longer exists, so Müngsten is simply a landmark."
"First drafts for a bridge connecting the two cities of Remscheid and Solingen go back as far as 1889. Preparatory work began in 1893, the bridge was finished in 1897."
"The six support columns have a maximum height of 69 meters (230 ft). In the middle of the structure, the main arc has a span of 170 meters (560 ft). The overall length of the structure is 465 meters (1,530 ft)."
"A total of 5,000 tons (4,900 LT; 5,500 ST) of steel were used in its construction. 950,000 rivets hold the structure together. During construction, a number of advanced building techniques were used."
"Anton von Rieppel (1852 – 31 January 1926), an architect and engineer, was in charge of the project. A memorial plaque at the foot of the bridge reminds one of his efforts."
"Originally, the bridge was planned to be single-track. However, high future traffic growth projections led to the redesign as a dual-track bridge. Before its opening, the rail distance between the cities of Remscheid and Solingen was . With a direct connection via the bridge, this distance shrank to ."
The Prussian Parliament approved the 5 million Marks required to build the bridge in 1890.
"The first breaking of the earth was on 26 February 1894. A total of 1,400 kilograms (3,100 lb) of dynamite and 1,600 kilograms (3,500 lb) of black powder were needed during construction."
"The bridge's official inauguration celebration took place on 15 July 1897. Emperor Wilhelm II did not attend the ceremony in person. Prince Friedrich Leopold of Prussia attended the festivities instead. Emperor Wilhelm II visited the bridge two years later, on 12 August 1899."
"In 1948, platforms on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line from 103rd Street to 238th Street were lengthened to 514 feet to allow full ten-car express trains to platform. Previously the stations could only platform six car local trains. The platform extensions were opened in stages. On April 6, 1948, the platform extension opened for stations from 103rd Street to Dyckman Street, with the exception of 125th Street."
"This station, located atop an embankment, has two side platforms, two tracks and maintains a level grade. It lies at the northern portal of the Washington Heights Mine Tunnel, which takes the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line through the bedrock of Manhattan. North of the station, the terrain of Upper Manhattan drops abruptly and the line becomes elevated to Van Cortlandt Park–242nd Street."
"Both platforms have beige windscreens and red canopies with green frames at the center. A waist-level black fence runs along either side. The platforms are offset as the South Ferry-bound one inclines more to the north than the 242nd Street-bound one. Each platform has two ""DYCKMAN ST"" mosaics."
"This is one of only two aboveground Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line stations with two tracks (the other being 242nd Street). A center express track, which is currently unused in revenue service, forms just north of this station and runs nonstop to just south of 242nd Street. A spur track used to be located to the south of the station, but was removed when the platforms were extended."
"The station is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, as is the nearby Substation 17."
"A 1991 artwork in the waiting area is called ""Flight"" by Wopo Holup. It features ceramic relief tiles depicting birds in flight."
"The station's only entrance is a station house slightly above ground level at the southern corner of Nagle Avenue, Dyckman Street, and Hillside Avenue. There is a ramp and stairs from street level to the station house. It has a turnstile bank, token booth, and two staircases to each platform, with an elevator to the southbound platform."
"In February 2014, as part of an ongoing rehabilitation, the MTA built a ramp from street level to the mezzanine and opened an elevator to connect the southbound platform to the mezzanine. The elevator, which was not originally planned in the station renovation, was built due to a lawsuit by the United Spinal Association. The elevator is of a ""machine room-less"" design and is the first of its type to be installed in the New York City Subway system. The renovations also included rehabilitation of the tunnel portal, realignment and rehabilitation of the platforms and installation of new cast iron lighting fixtures."
"The southbound elevator is located at the southwest corner of Hillside Avenue, St. Nicholas Avenue, and Fort George Hill, and is accessible by a ramp to the station house."
"This station is not accessible to the disabled on the northbound side because the suit was settled only after the northbound side was already renovated, and in any case, the area's geography made it prohibitively expensive to add an elevator to the northbound platform. Northbound accessibility was proposed in February 2019 as part of the MTA's ""Fast Forward"" program."

"Acton was born and raised in Coleridge, Cambridge, England. Without any sailing experience, he departed in a used 18' 4"" bilge-keel sailing boat for which he paid the modest sum of £400. The boat was a Caprice, a Robert Tucker design originally named ""Super Shrimp"" but referred to by Shane simply as ""Shrimpy"". Later Shane was accompanied for much of the voyage by his girlfriend, Iris Derungs, a photographer from Switzerland. He sailed westabout through the Panama Canal, circling the globe and returning to England as a local celebrity eight years later. The voyage is chronicled in his book ""Shrimpy: A Record Round-the-World Voyage in an Eighteen Foot Yacht""."
"In 1984, he set off on a second voyage from England to Central America via the French canals, the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands and wrote a book of this voyage ""Shrimpy sails again""."

"Ruddy attended The University of Notre Dame from 1990–1994. He was a four-year letterman and two year starter during this time. He was selected as a second-team All-America and first-team All-Independent by ""The Football News"" and the Associated Press. Ruddy also posted a perfect 4.0 GPA his junior and senior years at Notre Dame. He graduated with 3.86 GPA. He holds a B.S. in mechanical engineering. He also earned post-graduate scholarships from the NCAA and the National Football Foundation. He is also a member of Tau Beta Pi (National Engineering Honor Society)."
Ruddy was the second-round draft choice (65th overall) of Miami in 1994. Ruddy started 140 games of his 156 games played in which 16 of those non starts were his rookie year but he saw time in all of them. During most of his career he was the center for Dan Marino who has held almost every meaningful NFL passing record and is widely recognized as one of the greatest quarterbacks in football history.
"In 2001 Ruddy was named to his first and only Pro Bowl. He was originally named a second alternate, but replaced the injured Tom Nalen of the Denver Broncos. He was the first Miami center to be selected to the Pro Bowl since Hall of Fame center Dwight Stephenson in 1987. The last few years of Ruddy's career were plagued with knee problems and his playing time was limited. Ruddy was released by Miami following the 2003 season. It was rumored he talked to a few teams after his departure from Miami but didn't sign with any team."
"Ruddy was selected as one of the top 40 Miami Dolphin players of all time, and was named as a second team offensive line selection to the Pennsylvania Football News All-Century Team."

"Itbāy () or ʿAtbāy is a region of southeastern Egypt and northeastern Sudan. It is characterised by a chain of mountains, the Red Sea Hills, running north–south and parallel with the Red Sea. The hills separate the narrow coastal plain from the Eastern Desert."
"The Red Sea Hills are composed of the exposed Neoproterozoic volcano-sedimentary rock of the Arabian-Nubian Shield. Although the rock itself is 550–900 million years old, the mountains were created by uplift when the Red Sea itself was formed in the Oligocene, only some 23–34 million years ago. The Red Sea Hills are thus part of the same formation as the Sarawat Mountains of Saudi Arabia and the mountains of the Sinai Peninsula. The Red Sea Hills rise almost to today, but in the past were much higher. The Oligocene uplift caused the rejuvenation of their streams and the increased erosion removed most of the limestone and sandstone to expose the basement layer."
"The Itbāy is arid, receiving less than of rainfall each year with high variability. The Barka River, the most significant of the few seasonal streams that flow into the Red Sea, rises in the Red Sea Hills of Sudan and empties into the sea at the Tokar Delta. In prehistorica times it was probably a permanent river."
"The Red Sea Hills are a source of porphyry, which was being mined as early as the fourth millennium BC."
"The Red Sea Hills are inhabited by the Beja people, who practice pastoralism and live mainly near the dry riverbeds, ""wādī""s, that flow seasonally into the sea and the Nile, where there is limited vegetation. In antiquity, the Beja were known as the Blemmyes and their presence in the hills is detected archaeologically by the presence of Eastern Desert Ware from the fourth century AD. The material culture of the hills places it firmly within ancient Egypt's sphere of influence. Extensive mining settlements have been found in the Wadi Allaqi and the Wadi Gabgaba. The early Blemmyes built platform tumuli (flat-topped burial mounds), and the appearance of cairns to mark burials in the late Middle Ages may be linked to Islamization."

= = = Itinerarium = = =
"An itinerarium (plural: itineraria) was an Ancient Roman road map in the form of a listing of cities, villages (""vici"") and other stops, with the intervening distances. One surviving example is the Peutinger Table (""Tabula Peutingeriana""); another is the Antonine Itinerary."
"The Romans and ancient travelers in general did not use maps. They may have existed as specialty items in some of the libraries, but they were hard to copy and were not in general use. On the Roman road system, however, the traveller needed some idea of where he or she was going, how to get there, and how long it would take. The ""itinerarium"" filled this need. In origin it was simply a list of cities along a road: ""at their most basic, ""itineraria"" involve the transposition of information given on milestones, which were an integral feature of the major Roman roads, to a written script."" It was only a short step from lists to a master list. To sort out the lists, the Romans drew diagrams of parallel lines showing the branches of the roads. Parts of these were copied and sold on the streets. The very best featured symbols for cities, way stations, water courses, and so on. The maps did not represent landforms but they served the purpose of a simple schematic diagram for the user."
"The Roman government from time to time undertook to produce a master itinerary of all Roman roads. Julius Caesar and Mark Antony commissioned the first known such effort in 44 BC. Zenodoxus, Theodotus, and Polyclitus, three Greek geographers, were hired to survey the system and compile a master itinerary. This task required over 25 years. The result was a stone engraved master ""itinerarium"" set up near the Pantheon, from which travelers and itinerary sellers could make copies."
"Archaeology has turned up some itinerary material in unexpected places. The Cups of Cadiz, four silver cups found by workmen excavating a foundation at Bracciano in 1852, are engraved with the names and distances of stations between Cadiz and Rome. The term itinerary changed meaning over the centuries. In the ""Itinerarium Burdigalense"" (Bordeaux Pilgrim, 333 AD), the itinerary is a description of what route to take to the Holy Land. The ""Itinerarium Alexandri"" is a list of the conquests of Alexander the Great. Today it means either a travel journal or a list of recommended stops."

The film is based on the 1993 young adult novel of the same name by Lois Lowry."
"""The Giver"" premiered on August 11, 2014, and was released theatrically in the United States on August 15, 2014, grossing $67 million on a $25 million budget. It received a People's Choice Award nomination for ""Favorite Dramatic Movie"". However, it received generally mixed reviews from critics."
"Following a calamity referred to as The Ruin, society has been reorganized. Conflict, pain, and suffering have been mostly removed from human experience, but emotion, love, freedom, individuality, and joy have also been removed. Babies are brought into being through genetic engineering, and sexual desire is chemically suppressed. All memories of the past are held by one person, the Receiver of Memory, for the purpose of shielding the rest of the community from pain. The Receiver of Memory and his/her protégé are the only persons able to see in color, an ability otherwise eliminated from the community to prevent envy. The community is ruled by elders, including a Chief Elder."
"Jonas is a 16-year-old boy whose best friends are Asher and Fiona. On graduation day, Jonas is told that he will become the next Receiver of Memory and will progressively receive memories from his predecessor, the Giver. During his training with the Giver, Jonas gradually learns about the past and about joy, pain, death, and love. Jonas stops taking his daily injections and begins to experience emotion. Those who leave the community are said to have been ""released to Elsewhere"", but Jonas learns that this is really a euphemism for death by lethal injection. Jonas also learns that the Giver's daughter, Rosemary, had preceded Jonas as Receiver of Memory. When she began her training, however, Rosemary became so distraught from the memories she received that she asked to be euthanized."
"Jonas begins to teach his findings to Fiona and shares the concept of emotion with her. Jonas then tells her to stop taking her daily injection. The next day, he kisses her; kissing is an antiquated action that is unknown to the community and which Jonas learned about through memories received from the Giver, and touching a non-family member is against the rules. Jonas also shares his memories with a baby, Gabriel, who was brought home by his father. He develops a close relationship with Gabriel after discovering that he shared the birthmark Jonas has—the mark of a potential Receiver of Memory."
"Appalled by the deception of his community and by the Elders' disregard for human life, Jonas comes to believe that everyone should have memories of the past. Eventually, the Giver and Jonas decide that the only way to help the community is for Jonas to travel past the border of their land into the area called ""Elsewhere"". Doing this would release memories and color back into the community. When Jonas tries to leave his neighborhood, he encounters Asher. Asher tries to stop Jonas, but Jonas punches him. Jonas retrieves Gabriel—who is to be ""released"" for having failed to meet developmental markers—at the Nurturing Center; Fiona kisses Jonas and helps him escape with Gabriel."
"Meanwhile, Jonas' mother and Asher go to the Chief Elder to tell them Jonas is missing. Jonas steals a motorcycle and drives away with Gabriel. Asher is assigned by the Chief Elder to use a drone to find Jonas and ""lose"" him. When Asher finds Jonas and Gabriel in the desert, Jonas implores Asher to trust him and let them go. Instead, Asher captures them with the drone, but then sets them free by dropping them into a river; when questioned by the Chief Elder, Asher lies and says that he has followed her orders."
"Fiona is condemned to be ""released"" for helping Jonas. Just as she is about to be ""released"" by Jonas's father, the Giver tries to persuade the Chief Elder that the Elders should free the community. Unmoved by the Giver's arguments, the Chief Elder asserts that freedom is a bad idea because left to their own devices, people make bad choices."
"Jonas and Gabriel enter a snowy area. Jonas falls to the ground, overcome by the cold weather. However, he sees a sled like the one that he rode in a memory he received from the Giver. Jonas and Gabriel ride the sled downhill and cross the border into Elsewhere, freeing their community. This action saves Fiona's life, as Jonas's father realizes what he is doing and stops short of ""releasing"" her. Jonas realizes that he has succeeded in his quest."
"Jeff Bridges initially wanted to film the movie in the mid-1990s, and a script was written by 1998. Various barriers marred the production of the film, including when Warner Bros. bought the rights in 2007. The rights then ended up at The Weinstein Company and Walden Media."
"Bridges originally intended that his own father, Lloyd Bridges, would play the title character, The Giver, but he died in 1998."

"Air Baron is an economic strategy game published by Avalon Hill in 1996. Despite its family-oriented marketing, ""Air Baron"" plays far more like a wargame than a typical family money-driven game like ""Monopoly"". ""Air Baron"" is for two to six players, adjusting the playable area and victory conditions accordingly."
"""Air Baron"" challenges players to build an airline empire in the United States by amassing a plurality of market share and liquid assets."
"Players seek to gain ""dominance"" or ""control"" of hubs in order to amass market share. Dominance of a hub is gained by controlling the majority of associated domestic spokes; it carries a moderate income potential and market share gain. Control of a hub is gained by controlling ""all"" of the associated domestic spokes; it doubles the income potential and market share gain of dominance."
Any uncontrolled domestic spoke may be purchased at face value. Takeovers of controlled spokes require a higher fee and an opposed dice roll versus the controlling player. Several factors contribute both positively and negatively to each player's dice total.
"If, at the end of his turn, a player has a combined total of market share and cash equal to or greater than the victory margin, he wins."
"At the start of each round, one color-coded chit per player is placed in a cup. The chits are drawn sequentially to determine the current order of play. While the order of play in an individual round is generally unimportant, the interval between turns for a single player is a significant consideration."
"Starting cash is determined by die roll. To offset the advantage of first play, each player receives cumulatively more money during the initial turn."
"Every purchased spoke, plus all hubs, have a unique chit placed in a cup. At the start of every turn, the player randomly draws two chits, paying the owner appropriately. Chits are replaced at the end of each round."
"Beyond the primary domestic spokes, players can also purchase foreign spokes and jumbo jets. Foreign spokes benefit opposed takeovers at the associated hubs. Jumbo jets provide similar bonuses on the domestic spoke where deployed, or they can be held in reserve for later use in an opposed takeover. Additionally, spokes with jumbos pay double the usual rate."
"Normally players are limited to one purchase or takeover attempt per turn. However, players can declare a state of ""Fare Wars"" that allow an indefinite number of domestic takeover attempts provided:"
"While in Fare Wars, players receive an additional takeover dice roll bonus. Profits, however, are not earned while in Fare Wars. Since the state can only be entered or exited at the beginning of a player's turn, the randomized play order has a major impact on the potential for income loss."
"Several optional rules, including strikes, crashes, government loans, and bidding, are provided as part of an ""advanced version"". These rules may be added to the basic game collectively or individually as desired."

"In Hungarian mythology, Csaba, the mythical son of Attila the Hun and ancestor of the Hungarians, is supposed to ride down the Milky Way when the Székelys (ethnic Hungarians living in Transylvania) are threatened. Thus the Milky Way is called ""The Road of the Warriors"" (lit. ""Road of Armies"") . The stars are sparks from their horseshoes."
"To the Māori the Milky Way is the waka (canoe) of Tama-rereti. The front and back of the canoe are Orion and Scorpius, while the Southern Cross and the Pointers are the anchor and rope. According to legend, when Tama-rereti took his canoe out onto a lake, he found himself far from home as night was falling. There were no stars at this time and in the darkness the Taniwha would attack and eat people. So Tama-rereti sailed his canoe along the river that emptied into the heavens (to cause rain) and scattered shiny pebbles from the lakeshore into the sky. The sky god, Ranginui, was pleased by this action and placed the canoe into the sky as well as a reminder of how the stars were made."

They called it Wodliparri (wodli = hut, house, parri = river) and believe that positioned along the river are a number of dwellings. In addition, the dark patches mark the dwelling place of a dangerous creature known as a ""yura""; the Kaurna call these patches Yurakauwe, which literally means ""monster water""."
Aboriginal groups from the Cape York region of Queensland see the band of light as termites that had been blown into the sky by the ancestral hero Burbuk Boon.

The Aranda who come from central Australia see the band of the Milky Way as a river or creek in the sky world. This stellar river separates the two great camps of the Aranda and Luritja People. The stars to the east of this river represent the camps of the Aranda and the stars to the west represent Luritja encampments and some stars closer to the band represent a mixture of both.

= = = Dynkin system = = =
"A Dynkin system, named after Eugene Dynkin, is a collection of subsets of another universal set formula_1 satisfying a set of axioms weaker than those of σ-algebra. Dynkin systems are sometimes referred to as λ-systems (Dynkin himself used this term) or d-system. These set families have applications in measure theory and probability."
"A major application of λ-systems is the π-λ theorem, see below."
"Let Ω be a nonempty set, and let formula_2 be a collection of subsets of Ω (i.e., formula_2 is a subset of the power set of Ω). Then formula_2 is a Dynkin system if"
"Equivalently, formula_2 is a Dynkin system if"
The second definition is generally preferred as it usually is easier to check.
"An important fact is that a Dynkin system which is also a π-system (i.e., closed under finite intersections) is a σ-algebra. This can be verified by noting that conditions 2 and 3 together with closure under finite intersections imply closure under countable unions."
"Given any collection formula_16 of subsets of formula_1, there exists a unique Dynkin system denoted formula_18 which is minimal with respect to containing formula_19. That is, if formula_20 is any Dynkin system containing formula_19, then formula_22. formula_18 is called the Dynkin system generated by formula_16. Note formula_25. For another example, let formula_26 and formula_27; then formula_28."
"If formula_29 is a π-system and formula_2 is a Dynkin system with formula_31, then formula_32. In other words, the σ-algebra generated by formula_29 is contained in formula_2."
One application of Dynkin's π-λ theorem is the uniqueness of a measure that evaluates the length of an interval (known as the Lebesgue measure):
"Let (Ω, ""B"", ""λ"") be the unit interval [0,1] with the Lebesgue measure on Borel sets. Let μ be another measure on Ω satisfying μ[(""a"",""b"")] = ""b"" − ""a"", and let ""D"" be the family of sets ""S"" such that μ[S] = λ[S]. Let ""I"" = { (""a"",""b""),[""a"",""b""),(""a"",""b""],[""a"",""b""] : 0 < ""a"" ≤ ""b"" < 1 }, and observe that ""I"" is closed under finite intersections, that ""I"" ⊂ ""D"", and that ""B"" is the σ-algebra generated by ""I"". It may be shown that ""D"" satisfies the above conditions for a Dynkin-system. From Dynkin's π-λ Theorem it follows that ""D"" in fact includes all of ""B"", which is equivalent to showing that the Lebesgue measure is unique on ""B""."

= = = Anita C. Hill = = =
Anita Carol Hill (born 1951) is a LGBT American minister in the Lutheran Church. She is one of the first ordained lesbian women in the church and became a pastor before the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) changed its policy on LGBT ministers.
"Hill was born in 1951 and was raised in the Roman Catholic faith in Shreveport, Louisiana. As a young adult, she lived in Crystal Springs, Mississippi, and became involved in the United Methodist Church. Hill attended Mississippi State University where she earned a bachelor's degree in science. Hill went on to gain a master's degree in religious studies and a master of divinity degree from United Theological Seminary of the Twin Cities and studied at Luther Seminary in St. Paul, Minnesota."
"In the 1980s, Hill started out as a lay minister in the Saint Paul-Reformation Lutheran Church. By the 1990s, her congregation wanted her to be ordained despite rules against lesbian pastors in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) at the time. The church's head pastor, Paul Tidemann, created the goal for his church that it would have a non-celibate, openly gay minister by 1993. Hill was an open lesbian in a committed relationship. She was ordained on April 28, 2001, within the Extraordinary Lutheran Ministries but was later censured for her ordainment as an LGBT person. On September 18, 2010, she was formally inducted into the ELCA Clergy Roster. She left working at the church in 2012 and went on to fight a state constitutional amendment in her state which banned gay marriage."
In 2012 Hill joined ReconcilingWorks as regional director for the St. Paul area and later became its deputy director.

"Gilbert Jesse Brown (born February 22, 1971) is a former American football player. A nose tackle who played for the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League (1993–99, 2001–03), Brown played 125 Packers games (103 starts) recording 292 tackles (186 solo) and seven sacks. Nicknamed ""The Gravedigger,"" in honor of his celebratory dance following a thunderous tackle, Brown played in 15 Packers playoff games. He was a major contributor on strong defenses during the mid-1990s. His best season was 1996, when Green Bay won Super Bowl XXXI. He was also part of the Kansas team that won the 1992 Aloha Bowl, and was selected for the All-Academic Big Eight team in 1991."
"Gilbert grew up in Detroit, Michigan with parents Leroy and Ann Brown, older brother Wes, and younger siblings, Sheri, Tommy and Anna (all of whom went to college and became athletes). Like Leroy, Gilbert was athletic and fast. Even his brothers could not run home before Gilbert if he was craving a biscuit."
"During his career at Mackenzie High School, he recorded 189 tackles and 19 sacks. His senior year culminated in all-state honors. Brown also lettered in track, competing in the shot put. He graduated from high school in 1989."
"Back in high school, Gilbert never looked at big-time football factories such as Michigan. He wanted to get away from what he saw in Detroit. He wanted a quiet, smaller environment in which to live after one of his classmates was gunned down. So he turned down Bo Schembechler and the University of Michigan to go to a school known for its powerful basketball program, and not for its football ability: the University of Kansas. The Kansas Jayhawks coach Glen Mason said, ""The very first play of the first drill, he goes up against a lineman and he absolutely demolished him. We just looked around at each other."""
"With the Jayhawks, Brown helped build a winning program along with fellow defensive lineman and future NFL first round pick Dana Stubblefield (Kansas went to the Aloha Bowl in '92). But Brown went through more difficult times during his college years: a friend Brown had just met on campus died unexpectedly of spinal meningitis, and Brown's father died of congestive heart failure during Brown's senior year."
"He started all but 2 games in four seasons at the University of Kansas (1989–92), and was tied for sixth in school history in tackles by a defensive lineman with 168, fifth in career tackles for loss with 30, and had 7½ career sacks. He finished second on the team in sacks, tackles for loss and fumbles recovered in 1991 while helping the Jayhawks hold opponents to an average of 150.9 yards per game on the ground, which was the best run defense at Kansas since 1968 at the time. A year earlier, as a sophomore, was named as the Jayhawks’ ‘Co-Defensive Most Valuable Player’ and earned second team All-Big Eight Conference recognition. Brown started nine games at nose guard as a freshman...An All-Academic Big Eight selection in 1991."
"He came up with the ""Gravedigger"" move at Kansas—after a big defensive hit, he would dig an imaginary grave, which became his trademark and nickname."
He majored in human development.
"Brown was drafted by the Minnesota Vikings in the third round of the 1993 NFL Draft (79th overall pick), but was waived during the final roster cutdowns on August 30, 1993 in his first training camp due to his weight. He was listed at 315 in college, but showed up to Vikings camp at a hefty 355. But the Packers, desperate then for defensive linemen, picked him up on August 31. Brown played in just two games that season while he worked off some of his weight in practice. In 1994, he played but his season was cut short with a torn Anterior cruciate ligament. Again in 1995, he played, but an elbow injury cut that season short. In 1996, he started all 16 games next to Santana Dotson, Sean Jones and Reggie White, a defensive unit that allowed a league record low 19 touchdowns. Brown had a career-high 51 tackles, and his first complete 16 game season."
"Brown became a fan favorite, partly because he was easy to spot, and partly because of his eccentric gravedigger dance. During the 1996 season, it became known that Brown would regularly order the ""Gilbertburger"" — a Double Whopper with extra everything, cut in half with extra cheese, no pickles — always obtained from the Oneida Street Burger King in Green Bay. Burger King even made it available for a short time as a promotion in Wisconsin Burger King restaurants."
"Brown was a highly sought after free agent after the 1996 season, but he elected to take a pay cut to stay with the Packers. On February 18, 1997, he signed a three-year, $8.25 million contract, which was 10 times his 1996 salary, but was about $1 million less than the offer he received from Jacksonville. He said that he would rather stay with the team and fans that he knew and loved."
"Many people thought that he started getting bigger around that time, and thought that he was as high as 360 or 375, much higher than his listed 345. ""That was outrageous, I never got that big,"" said Brown. ""The biggest I ever got up to was maybe 350, something like that."" But the Packers were fine with his size. Despite his weight, he posted three sacks during the 1997 season, which tied his career high from 1994."
"After playing all 16 games during the 1998 and 1999 seasons, he spent the 2000 season out of football after his contract with the Packers was not renewed. Before the 2001 training camp, he worked out and lived for a time with Fred Roll, his former strength and conditioning coach at the University of Kansas, and subsequently returned to Green Bay for training camp in July at a perceptibly more svelte 339 pounds — and once again equipped with his former quickness. He was re-signed by the Packers on March 23, 2001, after which Brown announced, ""If I didn’t think I could do this anymore, I wouldn't be here""."
"Brown had two good years after his return to football. However, he ruptured a biceps during the 2003 pre-season, but played on without having surgery. He recorded 14 tackles, one fumble recovery (the first of his career) and one pass defensed. In a victory over Chicago (Dec. 7), Brown posted a season-high four stops, along with a pass breakup."
"On March 2, 2004, the Packers released Brown. He had played 125 Packers games (103 starts) with 292 tackles (186 solo) and seven sacks. He also played in 15 Packers playoff games. In franchise history, only Brett Favre (22), Mason Crosby (18) and Aaron Rodgers (16) have more."
"Gilbert was featured in the ""Sports Illustrated"" special, ""Where Are They Now?"", featuring former professional athletes and what they are up to. Brown is currently a co-owner of the Milwaukee Mile, a racetrack that is often used for NASCAR races and at one time was the Packers' part-time home field. Gilbert even claims that he will occasionally fit his massive frame inside a race car and take a few laps."
"Gilbert, with the strong influence of his mother and family, felt that he wanted to give something back to the community, so he started his foundation which helps inner-city kids, and many other causes such as Breast Cancer and Make A Wish. In 2002, he combined his love for cars with his desire to give back when he organized a car show, Gilbert Brown and Friends, in Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin, which benefited the Make-a-Wish Foundation."
"Galesville, Wisconsin establishment Champions Sports Bar and Grill has a burger named in Brown's honor: the Gravedigger burger, which weighs in at 93 ounces (just over 5¾ lbs). The weight of the burger is a callback to Brown's jersey number, which was 93."
"On October 23, 2007, the Milwaukee Bonecrushers of the Continental Indoor Football League announced that Brown had signed a three-year contract to be the team's new head coach. The Bonecrushers began their season in March. However On Tuesday, April 8, 2008, Gilbert Brown resigned as head coach of the Milwaukee Bonecrushers citing irreconcilable differences with ownership."
"On December 11, 2007, the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame, Inc., Tuesday announced Brown would be inducted into the Hall at the 38th Hall of Fame Induction Banquet, to be held the evening of July 19, 2008, in the Lambeau Field Atrium."
"On August 6, 2009, it was announced that Brown would return to coaching as the first head coach of the expansion La Crosse Spartans of the Indoor Football League."
"On April 1, 2011, Brown announced he was taking a leave of absence from the La Crosse Spartans."
"As of Aug. 2011, Brown is the head coach of the Green Bay Chill of the Lingerie Football League, which was later renamed as the Legends Football League."
"On March 12, 2014 Gilbert Brown and his project partner, the Vistelar Group, launched an IndieGoGo project to raise money for the production/development/distribution of curriculum to counteract bullying, called the Bully-Proofing Playbook for Parents, Teachers & Kids."

"Mediated communication is not as commonly used as face-to-face communication in the workplace, but there are different preferred media of communication for simple forms of coordination. E-mails and phone calls tend to be used for simple or complex coordination, but e-mails are also useful for retaining information and recording the exchange of information. In terms of communication solutions to certain situational factors, e-mails are used for recording the transfer of information and sending long, complex, and non-textual information, and phone calls and pagers are used for immediate communication. E-mails and phone calls are also used in knowledge sharing and information gathering. E-mails are rarely used to accomplish relationship goals, but they are used for conflict resolution. Individuals have a higher motivation to use cell-phone texting for weak-tie communication. The network effect has the most impact on e-mail, meaning that people tend to use e-mail more if their peers use it, too."
Email
"Electronic mail is digital mechanism for exchanging messages through internet or intranet communication platforms. The first message that was sent through a computer was on October 29, 1969. Raymond Tomlinson is known as the father of email, he was the first person who sent a message electronically. Email messages consist of three different components: message envelope, message header, and message body. There are also multiple benefits to using email. It is easy to use, free of charge, fast, and delivers information in a digital format. Email is one of the earliest and most basic resources on the internet and those many computers may not be able to access other internet services they are still usually able to exchange emails with machines on the internet. There are many reasons why using email is more suitable when it comes to the workforce. the first reason is because it is faster than a conventional mail so that usually reaches its destination and minutes even when it's sent from different countries. Another reason why an email is more conventional is because of the fact that there is less physical efforts .while using email you don't have to worry about buying stamps or envelopes or taking a trip to the post office. Also the use of email helps in the financial state because once you have gotten the hardware and software together it is basically free from there on. Email messaging also helps when having to send the same message to multiple people because of the fact that it allows you to send the same information simultaneously."
Text message
"A text message is defined as a short message sent electronically usually from one cellphone to another. The first text message was sent in December 3, 1992. The engineer that discovered text messaging was named Matti Makkonen. Along with the development of text messaging came a new development of dialogue when texting. As I stated in while texting people tend to exaggerate how they usually talk. An example of this or shown in blank where somebody may state that ""this homework is so hard I'm going to kill myself!!"" This dialogue is normal and texting but not entirely appropriate and other scenarios. Another thing that texting changed was a person's grammar or writing style. In it showed that 75% of friends noted that their best friends grammar or writing styles. Though only 25% of acquaintances noticed that their friends grammar or writing styles had changed. The evolution of texting is evolving and its uses it is not only being used to communicate with friends and family but it is also spreading to the workforce. According to in Zambia they are finding the results of HIV testing faster due to mobile phone texting. The turnaround time for results notifying went from health facilities reporting the results in 44.2 days pre-implementation to 26.7 days post inflammation due to texting. They developed a customized software built to deliver the test results automatically and directly from the processing laboratory to the health facilities of sample origin via short text message service text."

"In addition, common Fulani were inspired by Adama's exploits and formed into bands. Adama created a new position for their leaders: The ""lamido"" (plural: ""lamibe""), who was the leader of a particular territory, as opposed to an ardo, leader of a particular people. Both groups received flags of command and shared the same status in Adama's armies. Before his death, Adama would appoint over 40 non-ardo lamibe. They would prove his most loyal lieutenants."
"Adama turned his attentions on the only major state in Fumbina that could present a threat to his fledgling emirate: Mandara. It was an attractive target. It lay between Bornu to the north and Baghirmi in the Chad Basin, so its fall would facilitate the conquest of these areas. Its people were already Muslim, though they mixed the religion with pagan practices. Moreover, it had a large population from whom soldiers could be conscripted, and it was renowned for its excellent horses. Mandara was well organised, however, and would not be an easy prize. The people who lived there, the Mandarawa, had a long-standing rivalry with the Fulani, who had fought them under the Bornu in previous years. This animosity only served to drive more Fulani to Adama's armies, though, as many veterans were eager for another crack at an old rival. Furthermore, Fulbe rulers Modibo Damraka and others were already embroiled in fighting against the Mandara in the Diamaré Plain. Sentiment for jihad was high."
"Adama reached Guringa in 1809 with a large army in good morale. He quickly conquered the Mandara settlement at Guider and headed north, taking several more villages along the way. Outside of the Mandara capital, Dulo, Adama demanded that the king, Bukar Djiama, swear his allegiance and convert to Islam untainted with paganism. Bukar agreed to acknowledged Adama's right to rule his own subjects, but he refused to yield his own sovereignty. Adama and his men took Dulo with little fighting."
"Adama searched for someone to rule the settlement, but he found no one whom he felt adequate for the post. Meanwhile, his troops revelled in their plunder. No one expected the Mandara counterattack, which was launched from nearby Mora. Adama fled the town, and Dulo fell from his grasp forever."
"Adama and his men retreated to Yola (in present-day Nigeria). The town would become his capital by 1841. From here, he and his lieutenants continued to expand the emirate, which he named Adamawa after himself. The subordinates had to send him tribute in the form of cattle. Large settlements such as Maroua, Garoua, and Ngaoundéré fell to Adama or his lieutenants. By 1825, the Fulani had penetrated the Adamawa Plateau. Nevertheless, Adama lived in relatively moderate surroundings and never acquired great wealth."
"From Yola, Adama began the administrative tasks necessary for his nascent state. He did this with Usman's advice; he was to foster understanding between his people and their governors, facilitate communication between elders and their subordinates, and prevent the stratification of society based on class or wealth. The empire eventually took on three administrative tiers. At the centre was the ""emir al-Mu'minin"" (""commander of the faithful""), Adama himself, ruling from Yola and answering only to Usman dan Fodio in Sokoto. A contingent of councillors and administrators directly aided him, and a household staff of non-Fulbe and slaves doubled as his bodyguard. Below him were a number of district leaders, the lamibe, who ruled key settlements. Under them were a number of villages, each headed by a village chief."
"Meanwhile, some of the older ardo'en grew powerful through their own conquests. They regarded the unconquered areas near their territories as their own private backyards and defended these zones from all comers. This sometimes surfaced in their relations with Adama, such as when Bouba Njida of Rai refused to come to Adama's aid when the emir was fighting the Namchi at Poli. Instead, Bouba waited for Adama to retreat from the area to bring in his own forces and finish the enemy off. He then sent prisoners from the battle to Adama as a gift."
"Adama died in 1847 and was laid to rest at Yola (his tomb survives to this day). Adamawa covered 103,000 km² from Lake Chad to Banyo and was inhabited by 1,500,000 people. Further expansion to the south had proved difficult and undesirable since the presence of the tsetse fly and thick jungle made cattle rearing difficult there."
"Adama's son Muhammadu Lawal succeeded him after a brief regency under Hamidu bi Adama. Eventually, three of Adama's other sons would at some point serve as Emir of Adamawa. Not until the British and German colonial periods would the emirate come to an end."
"Despite their loss of independence, the Fulani were now the preeminent ethnic group of Northern Cameroon. They spread Islam throughout the region, establishing it as the dominant religion. Education also flourished, as new converts learned Arabic writing and studied the Qur'an. Trade flourished, and communications with it. The conquests were also important ecologically. Lands that had once been used for cultivation now became part of Fulani pastureland. Herdsmen cut down trees to make way for cattle, and they burned grasses that their herds later trampled. Centuries of such behaviour have replaced the region's forest with savanna."
"Ironically, the Adamawa was more sparsely populated after Adama's conquest. Rather than fight the Fulani invaders, many peoples fled, displacing others in turn. The Adamawa Plateau, once home to many of Cameroon's ethnic groups, soon became a pastureland, and the forest zone of Cameroon became more heavily populated."

"It took Girls Aloud five months to release ""No Good Advice"". Nadine Coyle said in an interview with The Lipster, ""We were No.1 for a month straight and then getting songs from all these other producers and we were, 'Nah, don't like it'. We waited from December to May before releasing a second single because we knew it had to be our strong point or we might as well kiss our careers goodbye."" Kimberley Walsh further exclaimed, ""We knew it was strong enough to come back with."" Girls Aloud reportedly had to re-record ""No Good Advice"" because ""it features rude words"", such as ""damn"" and ""shit"". However, the line ""Here I am / Dirty hands, I don't give a damn"" was kept intact. An explicit version of the song appears on the special edition bonus disc of ""The Sound of Girls Aloud"", replacing the lyric ""shut your mouth because it might show"" with ""shut your mouth because your shit might show"". Furthermore, an early demo of the song appears on a singles boxset released in 2009; this demo including the clean lyric in the first bridge and the explicit lyric in the second bridge."
"The song was released as a CD single, featuring an exclusive b-side entitled ""On a Round"", which was later covered by Taiwanese singer Jolin Tsai under the title ""Run Run"" for her 2009 compilation album ""Jeneration"". The CD format also includes the Dreadzone Vocal Mix of ""No Good Advice"" and its music video. The DVD single did not actually feature the ""No Good Advice"" music video, just a photo gallery and behind-the-scenes footage. It did, however, include audio of the track and the video to ""Sound of the Underground"". Another remix, the Doublefunk Vocal Mix, was later featured on the ""Life Got Cold"" single and the remix album ""Mixed Up""."
"""No Good Advice"" received mostly positive reviews from music critics. A BBC review described the song as ""better than anything else [...] in the charts."" Unlike many other songs, it was said to be ""not obsessed with trying to be a cutting-edge club hit, [...] with at least three different killer hooks welded together"" that borrowed heavily from the 1980s. It was said to be ""just as good, if not better"" than ""Sound of the Underground"". It provides ""more brassy and in-your-face lyrics of defiance and determination [...] Higgins injects an element of instant-catchy-cool to the songs without going overboard in trying to shape uber-chic dance floor hits."" On a less positive side, Tourdates.co.uk said that ""No Good Advice"" was a failure at adding attitude to Girls Aloud's music and imitates ""as many songs as possible."" The song has been compared to The Knack's ""My Sharona""."
"In 2003, the song won the Popjustice £20 Music Prize, an annual prize awarded by a panel of judges organised by music website Popjustice to the singer(s) of the best British pop single of the past year. Popjustice founder Peter Robinson wrote that the song ""established a motif that would saturate Girls Aloud's string of subsequent singles: an unpredictable and triumphantly contrary desire to push and pull the band in exciting new directions at every turn."""
"""No Good Advice"" debuted at number two on the UK Singles Chart, held off by R. Kelly's ""Ignition Remix"". The song slipped to number five in its second week on the chart. The single lasted two more weeks in the top twenty at numbers eleven and seventeen respectively. Overall, ""No Good Advice"" was inside the top forty for six weeks; it spent an additional eight weeks in the top 75, selling over 105,000 copies.

"The video for ""No Good Advice"" was directed by Phil Griffin, who previously directed ""Sound of the Underground"" and would also direct ""Life Got Cold"". It features the members of Girls Aloud clad in metallic, silver, futuristic outfits (which are seen on the cover of the original release of their album Sound of the Underground). Girls Aloud fade in and out like holograms, centered around a rusty old car parked near a phone booth. They are joined by several men playing electric guitar, whom they flirt with while in various other poses. In a separate scene, while a black background with bright pinkish lights being emitted from behind, all five girls shake tambourines and dance. The last two scenes are intertwined with neon-coloured animated special effects the background, finally ending with an explosion scene."
"In a special programme shown exclusively on MTV to promote their second album ""What Will the Neighbours Say?"", Girls Aloud confessed that they hated the ""No Good Advice"" video shoot. According to the group, both Cheryl and Sarah's trousers ripped and the make-up artist shouted at them. The group woke with bruised thighs the following day. The music video can be found on the group's 2005 DVD release ""Girls on Film"". In the group's 2007 DVD ""Style"", which also features the music video, Girls Aloud were horrified by the video upon watching it again. Regardless, viewers of FHM TV voted the video for ""No Good Advice"" as the fifth sexiest music video of all time in 2006."
"""No Good Advice"" was performed live for the first time on """" on 5 April 2003, a month ahead of the single's release. Girls Aloud sang in front of a checkered background in red outfits with black accents, as seen on the single's artwork.

The rendition featured an introlude taken from part two of the Pink Floyd song ""Another Brick in the Wall"". The following year, ""No Good Advice"" was featured as the second track on the Chemistry Tour. The group, who were created by mad scientists in the show's opening sequence, wore lab coats. The performance, influenced by Broadway, was set in a laboratory as each member was paired with a male dance partner. After a dance break, the mad scientist dancers performed a ""magic trick"" in which he made Cheryl Cole ""disappear"" and then reappear.

"David Michael Brown (born February 25, 1970 in Summit, New Jersey) is a former professional American football quarterback who played for Duke University and later in the National Football League for the New York Giants and Arizona Cardinals."
"Brown grew up in Westfield, New Jersey and played high school football at Westfield High School, graduating in 1988."
"After his career in football, Dave went on to become a director at New York Life Investment Management. In 2008, Dave joined Lehman Brothers where he served as a Senior Vice President of Lehman's Private Fund Marketing Group. He left Lehman Brothers in 2008 to become the Co-Head of Greenhill's Private Capital Advisory Group. In 2015, he joined Moelis & Company to lead their new private equity fundraising business."
"Brown had a successful career at Duke University. In his November 4, 1989, starting debut he threw for 444 yards against Wake Forest University, including a 97-yard touchdown to wide receiver Clarkston Hines to establish Duke's longest play from scrimmage. Later that month, Brown set a school single-game record with 479 passing yards against the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, upending Duke's rival, 41-0, to finish the year with seven straight wins and a share of the Atlantic Coast Conference championship. The Blue Devils subsequently received a bid to play in the All-American Bowl, Duke's first bowl game in almost 30 years. In 1991, Brown was chosen as the recipient of Duke's Carmen Falcone Team MVP Award."
"Brown ranks in the top ten in the following categories for Duke football quarterbacks: pass attempts in a season (#4, 437), pass attempts in a career (#5, 845), pass attempts in a game (#8, 54), pass completions in a game (#5, 33), pass completions in a season (#5, 230), pass completions in a career (#5, 463), passing yards in a game (#1, 479), passing yards in a season (#5, 2,794), passing yards in a career (#5, 5,717), touchdown passes in a game (#2, 4), touchdown passes in a season (#3, 20), touchdown passes in a career (#4, 42), 300-yard passing games in a season (#2, 4), 400-yard passing games in a career (#3, 8), 400-yard passing games in a season (#1, 2), and 400-yard passing games in a career (#2, 2)."
"Brown ranks in the top ten in the following categories for Duke football offensive players: total offensive yards in a season (#5, 2,851), total offensive yards in a career(#5, 5,770), total offensive yards in a game (#2, 470), and two-point attempts in a game (#1, 3)."
"Brown was drafted by the Giants as the top overall selection in the 1992 Supplemental Draft. His first start came on December 12, 1992, when he was forced into the lineup due to injuries of Phil Simms, Jeff Hostetler, and Kent Graham, dropping a 19–0 decision to the Phoenix Cardinals. To make matters worse, Brown himself was injured during the game and didn't play a down the rest of the season."
"Following Simms' retirement after the following season, Brown won the starting job in 1994 and helped guide his team to a 9–7 record, including a season-ending six-game winning streak. However, the Giants won only a combined 11 games in the next two seasons and their offense finished statistically worst in the league in 1996. This finish led to the firing of Dan Reeves, and the hiring of noted QB guru Jim Fassel."
"After injuring his chest during a game against the Dallas Cowboys, Brown lost his starting job in 1997 and was never able to re-claim it. Jim Fassel went the rest of the season with Danny Kanell at quarterback and had an unexpected run to the playoffs and division title. In the off-season Brown was signed by the Arizona Cardinals to play primarily as a backup, and he ended up finishing his career in 2001 with Arizona."
"Following his career in professional football, Brown moved on to investment management."

"Bayamón could not run with Arecibo and Flor Melendez knew that he could control the tempo of the game in the first two games of this final series. Both were very close games. Despite these woes, the Vaquero fans hoped Bayamon would come back. This was dispelled as soon as Richard Lugo was able to play for the Captains in game three."

The Capitanes established two different talent pools. As well as the original BSN team, they had a roster for PBL play that included selections in that league's player draft. Their subsequent first signings were Andrés Rodríguez and Bonzi Wells. Other international players signed by the Capitanes during the off-season were Elías Larry Ayuso, Angelo Reyes and Walter Hodge.

Among the violations cited were, failing to appear at road games, failure to pay amount owed to the league, and lack of communication with league officers. At the moment, the team held the second best record in the league and had secured a spot in the playoffs."
"The Capitanes responded by hiring one of Puerto Rico's top litigation attorneys, Lee Sepulvado of the law firm Sepulvado & Maldonado. The team's lawyers filed a complaint seeking a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction before federal court in Puerto Rico. The PBL hired O'Neill & Borges, one of Puerto Rico's top law firms and was represented by attorney Salvador Antonetti Stutts whom attended Harvard Law School and is a former Solicitor General of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico."
After the attorneys conducted oral arguments before Federal Judge Juan Perez Gimenez the court entered a temporary restraining order against the PBL instructing the league to immediately reinstate the Capitanes and allow them to participate in the 2010 playoffs. Shortly thereafter the PBL agreed to the issuance of a preliminary injunction order formally reinstating the team.
The matter received extensive media coverage and the PBL was forced to accept its wrongdoing by setting aside the expulsion of the team. The Capitanes vehemently denied the charges and all along insisted their only goal was to win in the basketball court and not the legal court.

"Highwire artist Nik Wallenda had been planning to walk across the canyon since 2008, but put the plan on hold first due to logistical difficulties and then to highwire walk over Niagara Falls in 2012. After his success at Niagara, he accelerated plans to cross the canyon. In March 2013, Wallenda and Discovery came to terms on television rights for the walk."
"To prepare, Wallenda practiced in his home town of Sarasota, Florida in heavy winds, including during Tropical Storm Andrea. On June 23, he successfully completed the walk without safety devices in approximately 23 minutes, making him the first person to tightrope walk across a Grand Canyon area gorge. At , it was the highest walk of his career. Afterwards, Wallenda said it was more difficult than he had expected."
"""Skywire Live"" aired live in over 200 countries worldwide. It was a ratings success in the United States, generating Discovery's highest-ever rating for a live broadcast. The show also generated a lot of interest of social media, with Wallenda's public display of his Christian faith being a focal point."
"Nik Wallenda is American highwire artist and member of the famed Flying Wallendas circus family. He has been walking the wire since age two and now holds seven world records. In 2008, he set the record for highest and longest bicycle ride across a tightrope. In 2012, he became the first person to successfully tightrope walk directly over Niagara Falls. The feat aired live on ABC who, much to the dismay of Wallenda, decided at the last minute that he would have to wear a safety harness for the event."
"The Grand Canyon area has played host to a number of high-profile stunts and daredevil feats. In 1922, Royal Thomas flew a Lincoln Stanard biplane into Grand Canyon National Park, landing just from the Canyon's edge. The park did not yet have stunting regulations and the feat was approved by park superintendent Walter Crosby. In 1980, stuntman Dar Robinson drove a sportscar over the canyon's edge, parachuting out of the car as it fell. He did the stunt in Hualapai Indian Reservation after being denied a permit by the National Park. In 1999, daredevil Robbie Knievel jumped a narrow portion of canyon in Hualapai territory on a motorcycle, breaking his own world record for longest jump in the process. The event aired live on Fox News. In 2006, Bob Burnquist skateboarded off a ramp into the canyon, descending to the bottom with a parachute. In 2011, Yves ""Jetman"" Rossy used a custom made jet suit to glide above the Hualapai reservation for eight minutes. He covered a distance of before parachuting into the canyon."
"Nik Wallenda originally secured permits to walk across ""the Grand Canyon"" in 2008, and planned to make the trip as early as 2009. However, the walk was delayed due to substantial logistical hurdles. His agent, Winston Simone, commented ""There's no electricity [at the planned location], there's no hotels, and for the last half-hour there are no paved roads."" Additionally, at a then-estimated distance of , the feat would be the longest walk of Wallenda's career by a significant margin. When the opportunity to cross Niagara Falls arose, the Grand Canyon walk was put on hold. Shortly after crossing Niagara Falls, Wallenda said he would try to make the Grand Canyon crossing ""within a year"". In August 2012, he said that he was ""98 percent"" certain that the walk would take place in May or June 2013 and announced he would get ""something in writing"" that no safety harness would be required for the walk."
"On March 18, 2013, Wallenda announced that he had come to terms with The Discovery Channel for television rights. ABC also bid for the walk, but was concerned about the show being repetitive with the Niagara walk and was not prepared to pay as much as Discovery. Additionally, Discovery emphasized its international footprint and promised Wallenda that he would not have to wear a safety device. After he came to terms with Discovery, both Wallenda and his network partners had to finalize permits with the Navajo. According to a tribal spokesperson, the decision to allow the walk was not taken lightly. The process included archaeological, biological, and environmental impact studies."
"According to Wallenda, ""There's a lot of updrafts and downdrafts, and the winds are hard to predict [in the Canyon]"". The air temperature during the walk was expected to exceed , with the steel cable hitting . To prepare, Wallenda walked a wire twice daily along the banks of a Sarasota river with fans watching. He practiced with wind machines to simulate wind gusts up to . During Tropical Storm Andrea he practiced among wind gusts and heavy rain. Wallenda said it was ""hard to prepare for [the updrafts] ... when it comes down to Mother Nature, we’re not in control."" His highwire shoes, which are custom made by his mother, had elk-skin bottoms to counteract the heat."
"On June 19, Discovery aired a special episode of ""MythBusters"" titled ""Duct Tape Canyon"" to coincide with Wallenda's walk. On the episode, Wallenda appears to the show's team as a hallucination as they attempt to survive in the desert using only duct tape."
"On June 23, 2013, Wallenda highwire walked across the Little Colorado River Gorge in the Navajo Tribal Park. The location was outside Grand Canyon National Park's borders, about 40 miles east of the main tourist facilities. In its official press release, Discovery previewed the feat ""Nik Wallenda ... will traverse the majestic Grand Canyon"". Other interpretations of whether or not the location was part of the Grand Canyon varied. The Reuters news agency described the location as simply ""the Grand Canyon"", while the Associated Press described it as a ""gorge near the Grand Canyon."" Commentary by ""Forbes"" writer Andrew Bender said there was ""one problem"" with the walk – ""It [wasn't] at the Grand Canyon"". He did, however, say the risks were as real and the visuals as spectacular at the location. ""National Geographic"" described the location as ""the Grand Canyon"" but noted that, like previous ""Grand Canyon"" stunts, it was taking place outside the park's borders."
"According to the United States Geological Survey, the Grand Canyon geological area includes the Little Colorado River Gorge. A Grand Canyon National Park spokesperson said the walk ""would not have been approved"" to take place in the Park due to regulations that ""events must not unreasonably impair the park’s atmosphere of peace and tranquility or have an unacceptable impact on the experience of park visitors."""
"The event, entitled ""Skywire Live"", aired live on the Discovery Channel in 219 countries with a 10-second delay. Coverage began with an hour-and-ten-minute preshow, followed by an hour-and-ten-minute main event. It was produced by Peacock Productions and hosted by Natalie Morales and Willie Geist. During the event, viewers were able to select from five different camera angles online at SkywireLive.com, including one attached to his chest that faced straight down. Another camera attached to Wallenda faced straight ahead, and a film crew filmed from the bottom of the Canyon."
"Before the walk started, Wallenda and his family prayed with evangelist and family friend Joel Osteen. He was then helicoptered to an island in the middle of the canyon to start his journey. To limit environmental impact, the event was not open to the public. Members of the press were required to sign a waiver saying they would not sue for post-traumatic stress disorder in the event that Wallenda fell. An armed security guard was positioned at the bottom of the canyon to protect his body from animals."
"As the walk began at 7:38pm MDT, Wallenda realized the wire had become slippery due to gathered dust. He spat on his hands and rubbed his shoes for better grip. Shortly thereafter, he stopped and crouched down on the wire due to wind gusts. He later stopped a second time to break the bounce of the wire that his walking had induced. Throughout the walk, Wallenda could be heard praying, repeatedly saying ""Help me to relax, Lord"", ""God, you’re so good. Thank you for this opportunity, Lord"", and ""Thank you, Jesus."" Midway through he said ""Thank you Lord. Thank you for calming that cable, God"". Wallenda ran the last few steps then jumped off and kissed the ground. Completing the walk in 22 minutes, 54 seconds, Wallenda became the first person to highwire walk across a Grand Canyon area gorge."
"At , the walk was the highest of Wallenda's career, about seven times as high as the Niagara crossing. He covered a distance of approximately in 22 minutes, 54 seconds, using wire. He carried a balancing pole weighing . Wallenda said it was important for him to vary his pace throughout the walk to prevent resonance effects. Terry and Mike Troffer were his safety coordinator and chief engineer, respectively, for the event."
"Commenting on the walk, a Navajo spokesman said, ""We are honored to be a part of this historic event and showcase the beauty that exists on Navajo country,"" and said he expected the event to boost tourism. Tribal president Ben Shelly said he was grateful for the publicity. ""It’s exposing what a beautiful land we have"", he said. ""Another nation exists, and it's the Navajo Nation."" However, a group of Navajo and other Native Americans protested the event saying the tribe should not be promoting the risking of human life to promote tourism. The Navajos did not charge for the use of the site, but Discovery did pay for the paving of a new road and parking lot to accommodate spectators."
"After the walk, Wallenda said it was more difficult than he had expected and that ""it took every bit of me to stay focused"". He said that dust had accumulated in his contact lenses and called the walk unusually stressful. Additionally, he said an ""optical illusion"" made it hard to concentrate. However, he called the view breathtaking, and said the opportunity ""was a dream come true."""
"""Skywire Live With Nik Wallenda"" drew an average of 10.7 million viewers in the United States, making it the highest rated program of the night. It beat out NBC's ""Crossing Lines"" (4.4 million viewers) and CBS's ""60 Minutes"" (8.2 million) among other offerings. Viewership increased steadily throughout the program, with a spike as the walk itself began."
"During the walk, 13 million people were tuned in. Those numbers made ""Skywire Live"" the highest rated live program in Discovery's history, easily beating the 4.21 million people who watched Felix Baumgartner's skydive in October 2012, and third-highest overall. The 4.77 share during the actual walk was also the highest in company history. Pre-coverage of the walk also pulled in high numbers, attracting 6.25 million viewers. ""Naked and Afraid"" which debuted after ""Skywire"" attracted 4.16 million viewers. Overall, Discovery had its fourth highest-ranked night ever."
"Online coverage attracted 2.1 million viewers, and tweets hit 40,000 per minute. During the peak hour, the program had 648,000 mentions on Twitter. Additionally, Shark Week and #SnuffyTheSeal trended nationally after a commercial for Shark Week featuring a fictional seal named Snuffy aired during ""SkyWire"". Overall, the show won 71% of TV-related social media usage for the day."
"To capitalize on the program's success, Discovery aired a follow-up interview, ""Skywire: Nik Talks the Walk"", on June 30. In the special, Wallenda provided commentary on his walk as the entire 23 minute feat was replayed."
"Commentary by Sally Jenkins published by the ""Washington Post"" called Wallenda ""The ultimate athlete, free of all law except gravity ... Beyond criticism. Committing a pointless act — yet praying."" Jenkins remarked ""We thought daredevils were gone — too much science had reduced them to the predictable ... But along has come this new breed."" Comparing Wallenda and Baumgartner's record skydive that also aired on Discovery, she speculated that the emergence of online media combined with ""stale, stupid predictability"" of television shows has led the re-emergence of interest in daredevil activity. She concluded ""Wallenda’s meaningless act restored the meaning of real."" ""The Telegraph""'s Ben Fogle declared ""I have never felt such fear for another person ... I have a new superhero: not a superman with a cape, but a slightly tubby dad in jeans and a T-shirt."""
"On social media, Wallenda's prominent display of his faith was the most popular topic. Conservative talk show host Dana Loesch tweeted ""Evangelism via entertainment on a tightrope and a major cable network. Brilliant."" In contrast comedian and noted atheist Ricky Gervais poked fun saying ""Well done Jesus for getting that bloke across the Grand Canyon safely. I bet he feels silly for wasting so much time practicing now."" Actor Dean Norris remarked ""Regardless of religious belief or not,feel little happier bout life then had #wallenda kept saying thank you nihilists, life is meaningless."" Interviewing Joel Osteen after Wallenda's walk, Piers Morgan called the event ""an advertisement for the power of prayer and Christianity in America""."
"Blue jeans manufacture Buffalo David Bitton was surprised that Wallenda wore a pair of their jeans for the walk. To celebrate, they erected a billboard showing a picture of the walk and reading ""Dear Nik, Thanks for taking us to new heights. Buffalo David Bitton."" The company also offered Wallenda and his immediate family free jeans for the rest of their lives."

"The Bank of Starbuck, at Main and McNeil Sts. in Starbuck, Washington, is a historic building built in 1904. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978."
"It was deemed significant as one of few surviving commercial buildings from the town of Starbuck's heyday, after the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company's main railway line came through in 1882. Its NRHP nomination also asserts it is a ""fine example"" of a small town bank in the U.S. west."
