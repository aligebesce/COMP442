I'll turn it.
I hope we can get out at the road end.
"Have you stuck a poster in, no you haven't, in the back window?"
"No, I haven't."
I think more people see the back
"Well I know, cos"
coming up that way than they do the front window.
"a lot of people go to  now, more people"
Yeah.
"there, yeah."
So they'll see it
Yes.

Have I got my glasses with me or I can't see the prices.
Oh!
I haven't got my purse.
"Oh well, brilliant!"
Is that a squashed ball in the road?
That means I haven't got a key to get back in the house.
If you just stop here I'll run over the road.
If you give me the key please.
Thanks.
Ooh!
There's a car wants to be in.
It's there.
Sorry!
He didn't look very pleased did he?
If he was in a such a desperate hurry he could have gone down and gone  over there.
We don't usually get a second post on a Saturday.
"We do, you get a parcel delivery."
Oh yeah.
Has anyone not got a map here?
Yeah.
Is it up there?
I don't know!
Why don't you ?
"Now, who got the cigarettes?"
"Oh, some of them are outside, yes."
"And in ten minutes if they ain't down here, I'm going back up there!"
What you going back up there for?
To get them to remember you.
"I'll walk up there and he'll be coming back down, he'll give me a lift back down."
"This is the bit where mama says I'm just like Susan , I'll have a go at it, I'll demand it!"
"Susan says she does it, but she doesn't really do it!"

"Yeah, that's what Paul said!"
Old age pensioners?
But it wasn't here!
It wasn't on then!
"No, I've er, I, I, think it happened since."
And you see er  it's one of those things that can wait.
Nobody.

You think you have?
See

"This is so , you know so many days"
Yes.
Yeah.
Just use different options.
Alright?
Better put your name at the top of the page as well.
We'll go through the answers anyway.
"Instead of just spouting at me, I'd just like you all to engage brain with ."
"Do you do, I've got one wrong."
"Alright, just  make some notes  and stuff that you've got already."

Going  back to the old trams.
But how can they go through the towns?
"Well trams Dave  they do both, they go on the railway lines and they go through the town centre."
Right.
Oh dear!
Don't watch this .
"The Olympics, not that far away."
Right.
Let's see.
Seven minus two is
Good.
Ah ah!
That's wrong.
Right.
I'll just turn off the television then we can concentrate on
I can.
Da David!
You're not doing very well on that question and you've done harder ones.
Remember how you do it.
Add the four to the three
I have.

Eighteen!
No you don't.
"Well do it, do it the way on your fingers."
You've got thirteen plus four.
"We went there, had a look."
Perhaps they'll open at night time.
Dunno.
When he asked me when they opened.
I don't know I said.
And what time do they shut?
And I said I don't know but I said I shouldn't think it would be too late.
I dunno.
And er
Did he eat the dinner?
Well I dunno.
I left it there and then  went down the caravan.
When we come back he'd got the dishes all ready for me.
So you don't know if he ate it or not?
No  the dishes .

She gave me a key.
Mm.
She told me here's your keys now she said because you've lost a set.
You didn't tell her any different did you?

So she give me a set of keys.

"And I told him I want them back, don't take them to the office."
So  what did they say about you keeping them on??
"I went in there again and I told her that you'd rung and some  Angela from sales  Andrea, we haven't got an Andrea she said."
He come to pick Sarah up.
Has she been down?
She didn't go to work today.
The idle sod.
Oh I'll tell you later why she's  not been  sort of I'll tell you in a bit.
Yeah er  I told her all about it so she did some for me right?
"And she says to get Dave when he comes in, I says yeah but I'm supposed to tell people about it."
"She says no don't tell him she says you told me, just do it  she says and then when we stop it you can tell him."
Well he were killing his sides a laughing.
"We were talking about cars and holidays and his mum and dad, ta, and I ke I says to Sarah shall I tell him?"
Give me that plate.
Erm I'll have these.
Yeah.
Well I thought you'd've ate them before now.

Oh I never think of putting them in that.
Anyway it takes more.

"I thought he'd want to see,take my shower."
"Yes, off you go then."
See you later.
"Right Dave, what do you want to do now while you're waiting?"
Get really clever!
So how are you gonna get really clever?
I'm going to get two sheets of paper and two pencils .
I haven't got time for a lot of stuff.
Don don't be getting a lot out tonight cos you've got Julie coming.
They're not a lot anyway.
Only two of them each.
Okay.
Right what do you want?
Take one sheet.
I've got one sheet.
Take the green crayon then.
"Right, I've got the green crayon."
Put it that way.
Hang on let me just  turn the television down.
You  you keep your eye on it so that when your tra tram programme comes on we can watch it.
Right.
What to do?
Well it's
that way you need it.
I want a table for this.
Well you can't use these tables.
Don't  let me just move this  magazine.
He said he loo would die before he got into a car like that!
"A Renault, one of the Renault fours or something."

I think he'll be okay.
"Joanne, what will I do?"

"Nine ninety nine, that's good isn't it?"
"you mean I'll think get it when you and me  and you know,"
You'll have to cut up that smaller.
"I know, my, do yo ."
"But you see no, when you think my room, my room's maybe, right say seven feet wi wide right?"
But normally should have a wee bit that goes in  and hole.
"So like, I don't know."
I think you must prefer  everything in that room.
"I know, mum."
You'll have a like  and then you could
That's gone down again ain't it?
Hanging on her now.

What?
Mm.
"They're prone for that,little red lights."
Oil filter
Mine is an'all.
Have you got a little red light ?
"Yeah, it keeps flickering on and off."
"On me dad's van, that's a pick-up, when she's"
Yeah.
"been running for about half an hour or so, you know when you come to a junction  flicking on and off."
I thought you were a mechanic.
I am.
Well get rid of your little red light then!
I've done it now .
It'd cost a lot of money.
"What, to get rid of a little red light?"
Yeah.
"Well I would do, I'd walk back for , me."
I'd say it's not on now.
Well me dad's needs an oil pump on it.
Er  and he won't pay out for it  cos he's a bit tight.
Er there's mine needs a few bits and bobs  I can't do it though cos I haven't got enough money.
"Me mum's  me mum's is alright, it's just me dad g keeps saying oh there's these noises  and I'll, and I'll go in it and there's no noise."
But it's
His ears are getting old.
I know.
He's supposed to be getting a hearing aid or summat.
Soon as   soon as he starts talking about cars yap yap yap yap yap yap  he doesn't stop.
"Don't worry love it's nice to hear you talk, you carry on."
You're picking on me.
I'm not picking on you.
You're picking on me again.
Picking on me again.
I didn't say that.
I just said are you a driver?
Yeah I am.
Oh I mean you just sound so young to be a driver that's what I was going to say.
Well I am.
You are young?
I am.
You are young.
I am.
Yes you are young.
Yes.
Yeah.
You are also a woman.
I am yes .
Yeah yeah yes yeah.
You're not that blonde one I've noticed driving around and nearly swerved to have a better look at the other day are you?
Well no that just might have been Rachael you were just been talking to.
No she does she says she she wouldn't be allowed to drive she says scatter brain you wouldn't let her drive would you?
.
Mm?
No I can't say anything can I?
Is she your boss?
Sort of yes.
Do you get well paid for this job?
No.
You don't well you don't deserve to get well paid because
Not for all the hassle we get.
for all the time that we have to sit behind you when we're trying to drive around blowing our horns going  get out the way .
Well ninety per cent of the time you shouldn't be where we are cos it's no cars.
Absolute rubbish.
Unless you're a taxi.
Don't they know who I am?
"There 's always one little empty , aching spot ."
"Oh , if I had somebody of my very own to love and care for , a mother , a sister , even a cousin ."
But there 's nobody .
"I have n't a relative in the world , and there are times when I 'd give almost anything to have one ."
"Well , I must try to be satisfied with friendship , instead ."
"Margaret 's meditations were interrupted by a brisk footstep behind her , and presently Dr. Forbes came up ."
"`` Good afternoon , Miss Campbell ."
Taking a constitutional ? ''
`` Yes .
Is n't it a lovely day ?
I suppose you are on your professional rounds .
How are all your patients ? ''
`` Most of them are doing well .
But I 'm sorry to say I have a new one and am very much worried about her .
Do you know Freda Martin ? ''
`` The little teacher in the Primary Department who boards with the Wayes ?
"Yes , I 've met her once or twice ."
Is she ill ? ''
"`` Yes , seriously ."
"It 's typhoid , and she has been going about longer than she should ."
I do n't know what is to be done with her .
"It seems she is like yourself in one respect , Miss Campbell ; she is utterly alone in the world ."
"Mrs. Waye is crippled with rheumatism and ca n't nurse her , and I fear it will be impossible to get a nurse in Blythefield ."
She ought to be taken from the Wayes ' .
"The house is overrun with children , is right next door to that noisy factory , and in other respects is a poor place for a sick girl . ''"
"`` It is too bad , I am very sorry , '' said Margaret sympathetically ."
Dr. Forbes shot a keen look at her from his deep-set eyes .
"`` Are you willing to show your sympathy in a practical form , Miss Campbell ? ''"
he said bluntly .
`` You told me the other day you meant to begin work for others next year .
Why not begin now ?
Here 's a splendid chance to befriend a friendless girl .
"The front door stood hospitably open , flanked by rows of defiant red and yellow hollyhocks ."
"Harrington paused on the step , with his hand outstretched to knock ."
Somewhere inside he heard a low sobbing .
"Forgetting all about knocking , he stepped softly in and walked to the door of the little sitting-room ."
Bobbles was standing behind him in the middle of the kitchen but Harrington did not see him .
"He was looking at Mary Hayden , who was sitting by the table in the room with her arms flung out over it and her head bowed on them ."
She was crying softly in a hopeless fashion .
Harrington put down his strawberries .
`` Mary ! ''
he exclaimed .
"Mrs. Hayden straightened herself up with a start and looked at him , her lips quivering and her eyes full of tears ."
`` What is the matter ? ''
said Harrington anxiously .
`` Is anything wrong ? ''
"`` Oh , nothing much , '' Said Mrs. Hayden , trying to recover herself ."
"`` Yes , there is too ."
But it is very foolish of me to be going on like this .
I did n't know anyone was near .
And I was feeling so discouraged .
The colt broke his leg in the swamp pasture today and Hiram had to shoot him .
It was Ted 's colt .
"But there , there is no use in crying over it . ''"
"And by way of proving this , the poor , tired , overburdened little woman began to cry again ."
She was past caring whether Harrington saw her or not .
The woman-hater was so distressed that he forgot to be nervous .
He sat down and put his arm around her and spoke out what was in his mind without further parley .
"`` Do n't cry , Mary ."
Listen to me .
You were never meant to run a farm and be killed with worry .
You ought to be looked after and petted .
I want you to marry me and then everything will be all right .
I 've loved you ever since that day I came over here and made you cry .
"He seemed to muse awhile , holding his lip in his hand , and looking now at me and now upon the causeway of the street ."
"`` Yes , '' says he , `` that will be the best , no doubt . ''"
"And he led me back with him into his house , cried out to some one whom I could not see that he would be engaged all morning , and brought me into a little dusty chamber full of books and documents ."
"Here he sate down , and bade me be seated ; though I thought he looked a little ruefully from his clean chair to my muddy rags ."
"`` And now , '' says he , `` if you have any business , pray be brief and come swiftly to the point ."
Nec gemino bellum Trojanum orditur ab ovo -- do you understand that ? ''
"says he , with a keen look ."
"`` I will even do as Horace says , sir , '' I answered , smiling , `` and carry you in medias res . ''"
"He nodded as if he was well pleased , and indeed his scrap of Latin had been set to test me ."
"For all that , and though I was somewhat encouraged , the blood came in my face when I added : `` I have reason to believe myself some rights on the estate of Shaws . ''"
He got a paper book out of a drawer and set it before him open .
`` Well ? ''
said he .
But I had shot my bolt and sat speechless .
"`` Come , come , Mr. Balfour , '' said he , `` you must continue ."
Where were you born ? ''
"`` In Essendean , sir , '' said I , `` the year 1733 , the 12th of March . ''"
He seemed to follow this statement in his paper book ; but what that meant I knew not .
`` Your father and mother ? ''
said he .
"`` My father was Alexander Balfour , schoolmaster of that place , '' said I , `` and my mother Grace Pitarrow ; I think her people were from Angus . ''"
`` Have you any papers proving your identity ? ''
asked Mr. Rankeillor .
"`` No , sir , '' said I , `` but they are in the hands of Mr. Campbell , the minister , and could be readily produced ."
"Mr. Campbell , too , would give me his word ; and for that matter , I do not think my uncle would deny me . ''"
`` Meaning Mr. Ebenezer Balfour ? ''
says he .
"`` The same , '' said I. `` Whom you have seen ? ''"
he asked .
"`` By whom I was received into his own house , '' I answered ."
`` Did you ever meet a man of the name of Hoseason ? ''
asked Mr. Rankeillor .
"` Oo , ' and her arms went out to him ."
"` And you could darn our clothes , and make pockets for us ."
None of us has any pockets . '
How could she resist .
` Of course it 's awfully fascinating ! '
she cried .
"` Peter , would you teach John and Michael to fly too ? '"
"` If you like , ' he said indifferently ; and she ran to John and Michael and shook them ."
"` Wake up , ' she cried , ` Peter Pan has come and he is to teach us to fly . '"
John rubbed his eyes .
"` Then I shall get up , ' he said ."
Of course he was on the floor already .
"` Hallo , ' he said , ' I am up ! '"
"Michael was up by this time also , looking as sharp as a knife with six blades and a saw , but Peter suddenly signed silence ."
Their faces assumed the awful craftiness of children listening for sounds from the grown-up world .
All was as still as salt .
Then everything was right .
"No , stop !"
Everything was wrong .
"Nana , who had been barking distressfully all the evening , was quiet now ."
It was her silence they had heard .
` Out with the light !
Hide !
Quick ! '
"cried John , taking command for the only time throughout the whole adventure ."
"And thus when Liza entered , holding Nana , the nursery seemed quite its old self , very dark ; and you could have sworn you heard its three wicked inmates breathing angelically as they slept ."
They were really doing it artfully from behind the window curtains .
"Liza was in a bad temper , for she was mixing the Christmas puddings in the kitchen , and had been drawn away from them , with a raisin still on her cheek , by Nana 's absurd suspicions ."
"She thought the best way of getting a little quiet was to take Nana to the nursery for a moment , but in custody of course ."
"` There , you suspicious brute , ' she said , not sorry that Nana was in disgrace , ` they are perfectly safe , are n't they ?"
Every one of the little angels sound asleep in bed .
Listen to their gentle breathing . '
"Think of that , Sophia Crawford '' -- Susan shook a floury finger at Sophia -- `` not -- one -- child -- under -- eight -- years -- of -- age ! ''"
"`` I suppose the Germans has et 'em all , '' sighed Cousin Sophia ."
"`` Well , no-o-o , '' said Susan reluctantly , as if she hated to admit that there was any crime the Huns could n't be accused of ."
`` The Germans have not turned cannibal yet -- as far as I know .
"They have died of starvation and exposure , the poor little creatures ."
"There is murdering for you , Cousin Sophia Crawford ."
The thought of it poisons every bite and sup I take . ''
"`` I see that Fred Carson of Lowbridge has been awarded a Distinguished Conduct Medal , '' remarked the doctor , over his local paper ."
"`` I heard that last week , '' said Susan ."
`` He is a battalion runner and he did something extra brave and daring .
"His letter , telling his folks about it , came when his old Grandmother Carson was on her dying-bed ."
"She had only a few minutes more to live and the Episcopal minister , who was there , asked her if she would not like him to pray ."
"` Oh yes , yes , you can pray , ' she said impatient-like -- she was a Dean , Dr. dear , and the Deans were always high-spirited -- ` you can pray , but for pity 's sake pray low and do n't disturb me ."
I want to think over this splendid news and I have not much time left to do it . '
That was Almira Carson all over .
Fred was the apple of her eye .
"She was seventy-five years of age and had not a grey hair in her head , they tell me . ''"
"`` By the way , that reminds me -- I found a grey hair this morning -- my very first , '' said Mrs. Blythe ."
"`` I have noticed that grey hair for some time , Mrs. Dr. dear , but I did not speak of it ."
"Thought I to myself , ` She has enough to bear . '"
But now that you have discovered it let me remind you that grey hairs are honourable . ''
"`` I must be getting old , Gilbert . ''"
Mrs. Blythe laughed a trifle ruefully .
`` People are beginning to tell me I look so young .
They never tell you that when you are young .
But I shall not worry over my silver thread .
I never liked red hair .
"Gilbert , did I ever tell you of that time , years ago at Green Gables , when I dyed my hair ?"
Nobody but Marilla and I knew about it . ''
`` Was that the reason you came out once with your hair shingled to the bone ? ''
`` Yes .
I bought a bottle of dye from a German Jew pedlar .
"O , a great stroke ! ''"
"he sobbed , and rattled off a leash of prayers ."
Hatch meanwhile reverently doffed his salet and knelt down .
"`` Ay , Bennet , '' said the priest , somewhat recovering , `` and what may this be ?"
What enemy hath done this ? ''
"`` Here , Sir Oliver , is the arrow ."
"See , it is written upon with words , '' said Dick ."
"`` Nay , '' cried the priest , `` this is a foul hearing !"
John Amend-All !
A right Lollardy word .
"And black of hue , as for an omen !"
"Sirs , this knave arrow likes me not ."
But it importeth rather to take counsel .
Who should this be ?
"Bethink you , Bennet ."
"Of so many black ill-willers , which should he be that doth so hardily outface us ?"
Simnel ?
I do much question it .
The Walsinghams ?
"Nay , they are not yet so broken ; they still think to have the law over us , when times change ."
"There was Simon Malmesbury , too ."
"How think ye , Bennet ? ''"
"`` What think ye , sir , '' returned Hatch , `` of Ellis Duckworth ? ''"
"`` Nay , Bennet , never ."
"Nay , not he , '' said the priest ."
"`` There cometh never any rising , Bennet , from below -- so all judicious chroniclers concord in their opinion ; but rebellion travelleth ever downward from above ; and when Dick , Tom , and Harry take them to their bills , look ever narrowly to see what lord is profited thereby ."
"Now , Sir Daniel , having once more joined him to the Queen 's party , is in ill odour with the Yorkist lords ."
"Thence , Bennet , comes the blow -- by what procuring , I yet seek ; but therein lies the nerve of this discomfiture . ''"
"`` A n't please you , Sir Oliver , '' said Bennet , `` the axles are so hot in this country that I have long been smelling fire ."
"So did this poor sinner , Appleyard ."
"And , by your leave , men 's spirits are so foully inclined to all of us , that it needs neither York nor Lancaster to spur them on ."
"Hear my plain thoughts : You , that are a clerk , and Sir Daniel , that sails on any wind , ye have taken many men 's goods , and beaten and hanged not a few ."
"`` Nay , y ' are the best heart in England ; I but laughed ."
"Forgive me now , sweet Dick . ''"
"`` Nay , no fool words , '' returned Dick , a little embarrassed by his companion 's warmth ."
`` No harm is done .
"I am not touchy , praise the saints . ''"
"And at that moment the wind , which was blowing straight behind them as they went , brought them the rough flourish of Sir Daniel 's trumpeter ."
`` Hark ! ''
"said Dick , `` the tucket soundeth . ''"
"`` Ay , '' said Matcham , `` they have found my flight , and now I am unhorsed ! ''"
and he became pale as death .
"`` Nay , what cheer ! ''"
returned Dick .
"`` Y ' have a long start , and we are near the ferry ."
"And it is I , methinks , that am unhorsed . ''"
"`` Alack , I shall be taken ! ''"
cried the fugitive .
"`` Dick , kind Dick , beseech ye help me but a little ! ''"
"`` Why , now , what aileth thee ? ''"
said Dick .
`` Methinks I help you very patently .
But my heart is sorry for so spiritless a fellow !
"And see ye here , John Matcham -- sith John Matcham is your name -- I , Richard Shelton , tide what betideth , come what may , will see you safe in Holywood ."
The saints so do to me again if I default you .
"Come , pick me up a good heart , Sir White-face ."
The way betters here ; spur me the horse .
Go faster !
faster !
"Nay , mind not for me ; I can run like a deer . ''"
"So , with the horse trotting hard , and Dick running easily alongside , they crossed the remainder of the fen , and came out upon the banks of the river by the ferryman 's hut ."
"CHAPTER III -- THE FEN FERRY The river Till was a wide , sluggish , clayey water , oozing out of fens , and in this part of its course it strained among some score of willow-covered , marshy islets ."
"It was a dingy stream ; but upon this bright , spirited morning everything was become beautiful ."
The wind and the martens broke it up into innumerable dimples ; and the reflection of the sky was scattered over all the surface in crumbs of smiling blue .
"asked Jill , who kept all her questions for Frank , because she seldom alluded to the tender subject when with Jack ."
"`` No , he 's off for the summer ."
Got a place somewhere .
Hope he 'll stay there and let Bob alone . ''
`` Where is Bob now ?
"I do n't hear much about him lately , '' said Jill , who was constantly on the lookout for `` the other fellow , '' since it was not Joe ."
"`` Oh , he went to Captain Skinner 's the first of March , chores round , and goes to school up there ."
"Captain is strict , and wo n't let Bob come to town , except Sundays ; but he do n't mind it much , for he likes horses , has nice grub , and the Hill fellows are good chaps for him to be with ."
"So he 's all right , if he only behaves . ''"
`` How far is it to Captain Skinner 's ? ''
"asked Jill suddenly , having listened , with her sharp eyes on Frank , as he tinkered away at his model , since he was forbidden all other indulgence in his beloved pastime ."
"`` It 's four miles to Hill District , but the Captain lives this side of the school-house ."
"About three from here , I should say . ''"
`` How long would it take a boy to walk up there ? ''
"went on the questioner , with a new idea in her head ."
`` Depends on how much of a walkist he is . ''
"`` Suppose he was lame and it was sloshy , and he made a call and came back ."
How long would that take ? ''
asked Jill impatiently .
"`` Well , in that case , I should say two or three hours ."
"But it 's impossible to tell exactly , unless you know how lame the fellow was , and how long a call he made , '' said Frank , who liked to be accurate ."
"`` Jack could n't do it in less , could he ? ''"
"`` He used to run up that hilly road for a breather , and think nothing of it ."
"It would be a long job for him now , poor little chap , for his leg often troubles him , though he hates to own it . ''"
"Jill lay back and laughed , a happy little laugh , as if she was pleased about something , and Frank looked over his shoulder to ask questions in his turn ."
`` What are you laughing at ? ''
`` Ca n't tell . ''
`` Why do you want to know about Hill District ?
Are you going there ? ''
`` Wish I could !
I 'd soon have it out of him . ''
`` Who ? ''
Uncle Dick wrote to me to return home at once and pay my court to the lady ; I protested .
"He wrote again -- a letter , short and the reverse of sweet ."
If I refused to do my best to win Miss Mannering he would disown me -- never speak to me again -- cut me off with a quarter .
"Uncle always means what he says -- that is one of our family traits , you understand ."
"I spent some miserable , undecided days ."
"It was not the threat of disinheritance that worried me , although when you have been brought up to regard yourself as a prospective millionaire it is rather difficult to adjust your vision to a pauper focus ."
But it was the thought of alienating Uncle Dick .
"I love the dear , determined old chap like a father ."
But last night my guardian angel was with me and I decided to remain my own man .
"So I wrote to Uncle Dick , respectfully but firmly declining to become a candidate for Miss Mannering 's hand . ''"
"`` But you have never seen her , '' said Mollie ."
`` She may be -- almost -- charming . '' ''
"` If she be not fair to me , what care I how fair she be ? ' ''"
quoted Murray .
"`` As you say , she may be -- almost charming ; but she is not Eve ."
"She is merely one of a million other women , as far as I am concerned ."
Do n't let 's talk of her .
Let us talk only of ourselves -- there is nothing else that is half so interesting . ''
`` And will your uncle really cast you off ? ''
asked Mollie .
`` Not a doubt of it . ''
`` What will you do ? ''
"`` Work , dear Eve ."
My carefully acquired laziness must be thrown to the winds and I shall work .
That is the rule outside of Eden .
Do n't worry .
I 've painted pictures that have actually been sold .
I 'll make a living for us somehow . ''
`` Us ? ''
`` Of course .
You are engaged to me . ''
"`` I am not , '' said Mollie indignantly ."
"Not just an ordinary letter ; dear me , no ."
"I took a whole day to write it , and you should have seen the postmistress 's eyes stick out when I mailed it ."
I just told her everything that had happened in Greenvale since she went away .
I made it as newsy and cheerful and loving as I possibly could .
Everything bright and funny I could think of went into it .
`` The next was old Aunt Kitty .
"You know she was my nurse when I was a baby , and she 's very fond of me ."
"But , well , you know , Aunt Emmy , I 'm ashamed to confess it , but really I 've never found Aunt Kitty very entertaining , to put it mildly ."
"She is always glad when I go to see her , but I 've never gone except when I could n't help it ."
"She is very deaf , and rather dull and stupid , you know ."
"Well , I gave her a whole day ."
"I took my knitting yesterday , and sat with her the whole time and just talked and talked ."
I told her all the Greenvale news and gossip and everything else I thought she 'd like to hear .
She was so pleased and proud ; she told me when I came away that she had n't had such a nice time for years .
`` Then there was ... Florence .
"You know , Aunt Emmy , we were always intimate friends until last year ."
Then Florence once told Rose Watson something I had told her in confidence .
I found it out and I was so hurt .
"I could n't forgive Florence , and I told her plainly I could never be a real friend to her again ."
"Florence felt badly , because she really did love me , and she asked me to forgive her , but it seemed as if I could n't ."
"Well , Aunt Emmy , that was my Christmas gift to her ... my forgiveness ."
I went down last night and just put my arms around her and told her that I loved her as much as ever and wanted to be real close friends again .
`` I gave Aunt Mary her gift this morning .
"I told her I was n't going to Murraybridge , that I just meant to stay home with her ."
"She was so glad -- and I 'm glad , too , now that I 've decided so . ''"
"`` Your gifts have been real gifts , Clorinda , '' said Aunt Emmy ."
`` Something of you -- the best of you -- went into each of them . ''
Clorinda went out and brought her cornery armful in .
"`` I did n't forget you , Aunt Emmy , '' she said , as she unpinned the paper ."
There was a rosebush -- Clorinda 's own pet rosebush -- all snowed over with fragrant blossoms .
Aunt Emmy loved flowers .
She put her finger under one of the roses and kissed it .
THANK you .
I told Clarice Almira that I was sure it was only a misunderstanding and that a word would set it right .
Donnell ... accent on the last syllable ... and St. Clair ... on no account Jacob .
You 'll remember ?
THANK you . ''
When Mrs. H. B. DonNELL had skimmed away Anne locked the school door and went home .
At the foot of the hill she found Paul Irving by the Birch Path .
He held out to her a cluster of the dainty little wild orchids which Avonlea children called `` rice lillies . ''
"`` Please , teacher , I found these in Mr. Wright 's field , '' he said shyly , `` and I came back to give them to you because I thought you were the kind of lady that would like them , and because ... '' he lifted his big beautiful eyes ... `` I like you , teacher . ''"
"`` You darling , '' said Anne , taking the fragrant spikes ."
"As if Paul 's words had been a spell of magic , discouragement and weariness passed from her spirit , and hope upwelled in her heart like a dancing fountain ."
"She went through the Birch Path light-footedly , attended by the sweetness of her orchids as by a benediction ."
"`` Well , how did you get along ? ''"
Marilla wanted to know .
`` Ask me that a month later and I may be able to tell you .
I ca n't now ... I do n't know myself ... I 'm too near it .
My thoughts feel as if they had been all stirred up until they were thick and muddy .
The only thing I feel really sure of having accomplished today is that I taught Cliffie Wright that A is A .
He never knew it before .
Is n't it something to have started a soul along a path that may end in Shakespeare and Paradise Lost ? ''
Mrs. Lynde came up later on with more encouragement .
That good lady had waylaid the schoolchildren at her gate and demanded of them how they liked their new teacher .
"`` And every one of them said they liked you splendid , Anne , except Anthony Pye ."
I must admit he did n't .
"He said you ` were n't any good , just like all girl teachers . '"
There 's the Pye leaven for you .
But never mind . ''
"`` I 'm not going to mind , '' said Anne quietly , `` and I 'm going to make Anthony Pye like me yet ."
Patience and kindness will surely win him . ''
"`` Well , you can never tell about a Pye , '' said Mrs. Rachel cautiously ."
"`` They go by contraries , like dreams , often as not ."
"As for that DonNELL woman , she 'll get no DonNELLing from me , I can assure you ."
And we must make other things too .
I 'll help you in the morning .
"But I ca n't help you in the afternoon for I have to make a wedding-dress and time is the essence of the contract , Susan . ''"
Susan felt that she was really too old to be subjected to such shocks .
"`` Who are you going to marry , Rilla ? ''"
she asked feebly .
"`` Susan , darling , I am not the happy bride ."
Miranda Pryor is going to marry Joe Milgrave tomorrow afternoon while her father is away in town .
"A war-wedding , Susan -- is n't that thrilling and romantic ?"
I never was so excited in my life . ''
"The excitement soon spread over Ingleside , infecting even Mrs. Blythe and Susan ."
"`` I 'll go to work on that cake at once , '' vowed Susan , with a glance at the clock ."
"`` Mrs. Dr. dear , will you pick over the fruit and beat up the eggs ?"
If you will I can have that cake ready for the oven by the evening .
Tomorrow morning we can make salads and other things .
I will work all night if necessary to get the better of Whiskers-on-the-moon . ''
"Miranda arrived , tearful and breathless ."
"`` We must fix over my white dress for you to wear , '' said Rilla ."
`` It will fit you very nicely with a little alteration . ''
"To work went the two girls , ripping , fitting , basting , sewing for dear life ."
By dint of unceasing effort they got the dress done by seven o'clock and Miranda tried it on in Rilla 's room .
"`` It 's very pretty -- but oh , if I could just have a veil , '' sighed Miranda ."
`` I 've always dreamed of being married in a lovely white veil . ''
Some good fairy evidently waits on the wishes of war-brides .
"The door opened and Mrs. Blythe came in , her arms full of a filmy burden ."
"`` Miranda dear , '' she said , `` I want you to wear my wedding-veil tomorrow ."
"It is twenty-four years since I was a bride at old Green Gables -- the happiest bride that ever was -- and the wedding-veil of a happy bride brings good luck , they say . ''"
"`` Oh , how sweet of you , Mrs. Blythe , '' said Miranda , the ready tears starting to her eyes ."
The veil was tried on and draped .
Susan dropped in to approve but dared not linger .
"`` I 've got that cake in the oven , '' she said , `` and I am pursuing a policy of watchful waiting ."
The evening news is that the Grand Duke has captured Erzerum .
Emily was quite sincere .
"Lynde had not told her , and Emily did not recognize him ."
"`` Well , Mr. Douglas did a brave thing in rescuing him , '' said Dr. Ames ."
`` I 'll be back tomorrow . ''
Harmon remained delirious for a week .
"Alan went every day to Four Winds , his interest in a man he had rescued explaining his visits to the Rexton people ."
"The Captain had returned and , though not absolutely uncivil , was taciturn and moody ."
Alan reflected grimly that Captain Anthony probably owed him a grudge for saving Harmon 's life .
"He never saw Lynde alone , but her strained , tortured face made his heart ache ."
Old Emily only seemed her natural self .
She waited on Harmon and Dr. Ames considered her a paragon of a nurse .
Alan thought it was well that Emily knew nothing more of Harmon than that he was an old friend of Captain Anthony 's .
"He felt sure that she would have walked out of the sick room and never reentered it had she guessed that the patient was the man whom , above all others , Lynde dreaded and feared ."
One afternoon when Alan went to Four Winds Emily met him at the door .
"`` He 's better , '' she announced ."
`` He had a good sleep this afternoon and when he woke he was quite himself .
You 'd better go up and see him .
I told him all I could but he wants to see you .
Anthony and Lynde are away to Crosse Harbour .
Go up and talk to him . ''
Harmon turned his head as the minister approached and held out his hand with a smile .
"`` You 're the preacher , I reckon ."
They tell me you were the man who pulled me out of that hurly-burly .
I was n't hardly worth saving but I 'm as grateful to you as if I was . ''
"`` I only -- did -- what any man would have done , '' said Alan , taking the offered hand ."
`` I do n't know about that .
"Anyhow , it 's not every man could have done it ."
I 'd been hanging in that rigging all day and most of the night before .
There were five more of us but they dropped off .
I knew it was no use to try to swim ashore alone -- the backwater would be too much for me .
I must have been a lot of trouble .
That old woman says I 've been raving for a week .
"Oh no , he just tormented her refined womanhood to the verge of frenzy , that was all ."
He died when you were a baby .
"And a year later I found out your mother could love me , rough sailor and all as I was ."
I married her and brought her here .
We had fifteen years of happiness together .
I 'm not a good man -- but I made your mother happy in spite of her wrecked health and her dark memories .
"It was her wish that you should be known as my daughter , but under the present circumstances I know she would wish that you should be told the truth ."
"Marry your man , Lynde , and go away with him ."
Emily will go with you if you like .
I 'm going back to the sea .
I 've been hankering for it ever since your mother died .
I 'll go out of your life .
"There , do n't cry -- I hate to see a woman cry ."
"Mr. Douglas , I 'll leave you to dry her tears and I 'll go up to the house and have a talk with Harmon . ''"
"When Captain Anthony had disappeared behind the Point , Alan turned to Lynde ."
She was sobbing softly and her face was wet with tears .
Alan drew her head down on his shoulder .
"`` Sweetheart , the dark past is all put by ."
Our future begins with promise .
"All is well with us , dear Lynde . ''"
"Like a child , she put her arms about his neck and their lips met ."
Marcella 's Reward Dr. Clark shook his head gravely .
"`` She is not improving as fast as I should like to see , '' he said ."
`` In fact -- er -- she seems to have gone backward the past week .
"You must send her to the country , Miss Langley ."
The heat here is too trying for her . ''
"Dr. Clark might as well have said , `` You must send her to the moon '' -- or so Marcella thought bitterly ."
Despair filled her heart as she looked at Patty 's white face and transparent hands and listened to the doctor 's coolly professional advice .
Patty 's illness had already swept away the scant savings of three years .
Marcella had nothing left with which to do anything more for her .
She did not make any answer to the doctor -- she could not .
"Besides , what could she say , with Patty 's big blue eyes , bigger and bluer than ever in her thin face , looking at her so wistfully ?"
Christopher shook his head .
"`` No , I understand they 're not on very good terms ."
Sara do n't like Charles Stuart or his wife -- and I do n't blame her .
"She wo n't stay there , not likely ."
Probably she 'll go and live in town .
Strange she never married .
"She was reckoned handsome , and had plenty of beaus at one time . ''"
Jeffrey swung out of the group and started homeward with his dog .
To stand by and hear Sara Stuart discussed after this fashion was more than he could endure .
"The men idly watched his tall , erect figure as he went along the valley ."
"`` Queer chap , Jeff , '' said Alec Churchill reflectively ."
"`` Jeff 's all right , '' said Christopher in a patronizing way ."
`` There ai n't a better man or neighbour alive .
"I 've lived next farm to him for thirty years , so I ought to know ."
But he 's queer sartainly -- not like other people -- kind of unsociable .
He do n't care for a thing ` cept dogs and reading and mooning round woods and fields .
"That ai n't natural , you know ."
But I must say he 's a good farmer .
"He 's got the best farm in Bayside , and that 's a real nice house he put up on it ."
Ai n't it an odd thing he never married ?
Never seemed to have no notion of it .
I ca n't recollect of Jeff Miller 's ever courting anybody .
That 's another unnatural thing about him . ''
"`` I 've always thought that Jeff thought himself a cut or two above the rest of us , '' said Tom Scovel with a sneer ."
`` Maybe he thinks the Bayside girls ai n't good enough for him . ''
"`` There ai n't no such dirty pride about Jeff , '' pronounced Christopher conclusively ."
"`` And the Millers are the best family hereabouts , leaving the kunnel 's out ."
"And Jeff 's well off -- nobody knows how well , I reckon , but I can guess , being his land neighbour ."
"Jeff ai n't no fool nor loafer , if he is a bit queer . ''"
"Meanwhile , the object of these remarks was striding homeward and thinking , not of the men behind him , but of Sara Stuart ."
He must go to her at once .
"He had not intruded on her since her father 's death , thinking her sorrow too great for him to meddle with ."
"Wo n't you be frank with me , dear ?"
Do you honestly think you can never learn to love me ? ''
"`` It is not that , '' said Lynde in a hard , unnatural voice ."
`` I am married already . ''
"Alan stared at her , not in the least comprehending the meaning of her words ."
"Everything -- pain , hope , fear , passion -- had slipped away from him for a moment , as if he had been stunned by a physical blow ."
He could not have heard aright .
`` Married ? ''
he said dully .
"`` Lynde , you can not mean it ? ''"
"`` Yes , I do ."
I was married three years ago . ''
`` Why was I not told this ? ''
"Alan 's voice was stern , although he did not mean it to be so , and she shrank and shivered ."
Then she began in a low monotonous tone from which all feeling of any sort seemed to have utterly faded .
"`` Three years ago Mother was very ill -- so ill that any shock would kill her , so the doctor Father brought from the lake told us ."
A man -- a young sea captain -- came here to see Father .
His name was Frank Harmon and he had known Father well in the past .
They had sailed together .
Father seemed to be afraid of him -- I had never seen him afraid of anybody before .
"I could not think much about anybody except Mother then , but I knew I did not quite like Captain Harmon , although he was very polite to me and I suppose might have been called handsome ."
One day Father came to me and told me I must marry Captain Harmon .
I laughed at the idea at first but when I looked at Father 's face I did not laugh .
It was all white and drawn .
He implored me to marry Captain Harmon .
He said if I did not it would mean shame and disgrace for us all -- that Captain Harmon had some hold on him and would tell what he knew if I did not marry him .
I do n't know what it was but it must have been something dreadful .
And he said it would kill Mother .
"I knew it would , and that was what drove me to consent at last ."
"Oh , I ca n't tell you what I suffered ."
I was only seventeen and there was nobody to advise me .
One day Father and Captain Harmon and I went down the lake to Crosse Harbour and we were married there .
I hereby punish you by prompt departure from Orchard Knob .
"Yet I do not dislike audacity , at some times , in some places , in some people ."
It is only from a sense of duty that I punish it in this case .
And it was really pleasant in Eden .
"If you do not mail that letter , and if you still persist in your very absurd interpretation of the meaning of Eve 's kiss , we may meet again in town ."
"Until then I remain , `` Very sincerely yours , `` Dora Lynne Mannering . ''"
Murray kissed the grey letter and put it tenderly away in his pocket .
Then he took his letter to his uncle and tore it into tiny fragments .
Finally he looked at his watch .
"`` If I hurry , I can catch the afternoon train to town , '' he said ."
"Aunt Susanna 's Birthday Celebration Good afternoon , Nora May ."
I 'm real glad to see you .
I 've been watching you coming down the hill and I hoping you 'd turn in at our gate .
Going to visit with me this afternoon ?
That 's good .
I 'm feeling so happy and delighted and I 've been hankering for someone to tell it all to .
Tell you about it ?
"Well , I guess I might as well ."
It ai n't any breach of confidence .
You did n't know Anne Douglas ?
"She taught school here three years ago , afore your folks moved over from Talcott ."
She belonged up Montrose way and she was only eighteen when she came here to teach .
She boarded with us and her and me were the greatest chums .
She was just a sweet girl .
"She was the prettiest teacher we ever had , and that 's saying a good deal , for Springdale has always been noted for getting good-looking schoolmarms , just as Miller 's Road is noted for its humly ones ."
"Anne had yards of brown wavy hair and big , dark blue eyes ."
"Her face was kind o ' pale , but when she smiled you would have to smile too , if you 'd been chief mourner at your own funeral ."
"She was a well-spring of joy in the house , and we all loved her ."
Gilbert Martin began to drive her the very first week she was here .
"Gilbert is my sister Julia 's son , and a fine young fellow he is ."
"It ai n't good manners to brag of your own relations , but I 'm always forgetting and doing it ."
Gil was a great pet of mine .
"`` No , sir , '' replied the captain , `` only that he 's too familiar . ''"
"`` Well , now , and the short and long of it , captain ? ''"
asked the doctor .
`` Tell us what you want . ''
"`` Well , gentlemen , are you determined to go on this cruise ? ''"
"`` Like iron , '' answered the squire ."
"`` Very good , '' said the captain ."
"`` Then , as you 've heard me very patiently , saying things that I could not prove , hear me a few words more ."
They are putting the powder and the arms in the fore hold .
"Now , you have a good place under the cabin ; why not put them there ?"
-- first point .
"Then , you are bringing four of your own people with you , and they tell me some of them are to be berthed forward ."
Why not give them the berths here beside the cabin ?
-- second point . ''
`` Any more ? ''
asked Mr. Trelawney .
"`` One more , '' said the captain ."
`` There 's been too much blabbing already . ''
"`` Far too much , '' agreed the doctor ."
"`` I 'll tell you what I 've heard myself , '' continued Captain Smollett : `` that you have a map of an island , that there 's crosses on the map to show where treasure is , and that the island lies -- '' And then he named the latitude and longitude exactly ."
"`` I never told that , '' cried the squire , `` to a soul ! ''"
"`` The hands know it , sir , '' returned the captain ."
"`` Livesey , that must have been you or Hawkins , '' cried the squire ."
"`` It does n't much matter who it was , '' replied the doctor ."
And I could see that neither he nor the captain paid much regard to Mr. Trelawney 's protestations .
"Neither did I , to be sure , he was so loose a talker ; yet in this case I believe he was really right and that nobody had told the situation of the island ."
"`` Well , gentlemen , '' continued the captain , `` I do n't know who has this map ; but I make it a point , it shall be kept secret even from me and Mr. Arrow ."
Otherwise I would ask you to let me resign . ''
"`` I see , '' said the doctor ."
"`` You wish us to keep this matter dark and to make a garrison of the stern part of the ship , manned with my friend 's own people , and provided with all the arms and powder on board ."
"In other words , you fear a mutiny . ''"
"`` Sir , '' said Captain Smollett , `` with no intention to take offence , I deny your right to put words into my mouth ."
"When he had gone home Anne soothed and warmed the sobbing , shivering Dora , got her her supper and put her to bed ."
"Then she returned to the kitchen , just as Marilla came grimly in , leading , or rather pulling , the reluctant , cobwebby Davy , whom she had just found hidden away in the darkest corner of the stable ."
She jerked him to the mat on the middle of the floor and then went and sat down by the east window .
Anne was sitting limply by the west window .
Between them stood the culprit .
"His back was toward Marilla and it was a meek , subdued , frightened back ; but his face was toward Anne and although it was a little shamefaced there was a gleam of comradeship in Davy 's eyes , as if he knew he had done wrong and was going to be punished for it , but could count on a laugh over it all with Anne later on ."
"But no half hidden smile answered him in Anne 's gray eyes , as there might have done had it been only a question of mischief ."
There was something else ... something ugly and repulsive .
"`` How could you behave so , Davy ? ''"
she asked sorrowfully .
Davy squirmed uncomfortably .
`` I just did it for fun .
Things have been so awful quiet here for so long that I thought it would be fun to give you folks a big scare .
"It was , too . ''"
In spite of fear and a little remorse Davy grinned over the recollection .
"`` But you told a falsehood about it , Davy , '' said Anne , more sorrowfully than ever ."
Davy looked puzzled .
`` What 's a falsehood ?
Do you mean a whopper ? ''
`` I mean a story that was not true . ''
"`` Course I did , '' said Davy frankly ."
`` If I had n't you would n't have been scared .
I HAD to tell it . ''
Anne was feeling the reaction from her fright and exertions .
Davy 's impenitent attitude gave the finishing touch .
Two big tears brimmed up in her eyes .
"`` Oh , Davy , how could you ? ''"
"she said , with a quiver in her voice ."
`` Do n't you know how wrong it was ? ''
Davy was aghast .
Anne crying ... he had made Anne cry !
A flood of real remorse rolled like a wave over his warm little heart and engulfed it .
"So when the man woke , there was a poke beside him and something into the inside of it that moved ."
"Well , it seems he was one of these gentry that think aye the worst of things ; and for greater security , he stuck his dirk throughout that poke before he opened it , and there was his bairn dead ."
"I am thinking to myself , Mr. Balfour , that you and the man are very much alike . ''"
* Bag .
`` Do you mean you had no hand in it ? ''
"cried I , sitting up ."
"`` I will tell you first of all , Mr. Balfour of Shaws , as one friend to another , '' said Alan , `` that if I were going to kill a gentleman , it would not be in my own country , to bring trouble on my clan ; and I would not go wanting sword and gun , and with a long fishing-rod upon my back . ''"
"`` Well , '' said I , `` that 's true ! ''"
"`` And now , '' continued Alan , taking out his dirk and laying his hand upon it in a certain manner , `` I swear upon the Holy Iron I had neither art nor part , act nor thought in it . ''"
`` I thank God for that ! ''
"cried I , and offered him my hand ."
He did not appear to see it .
`` And here is a great deal of work about a Campbell ! ''
said he .
"`` They are not so scarce , that I ken ! ''"
"`` At least , '' said I , `` you can not justly blame me , for you know very well what you told me in the brig. But the temptation and the act are different , I thank God again for that ."
"We may all be tempted ; but to take a life in cold blood , Alan ! ''"
And I could say no more for the moment .
`` And do you know who did it ? ''
I added .
`` Do you know that man in the black coat ? ''
"`` I have nae clear mind about his coat , '' said Alan cunningly , `` but it sticks in my head that it was blue . ''"
"`` Blue or black , did ye know him ? ''"
"said I. `` I couldnae just conscientiously swear to him , '' says Alan ."
"`` He gaed very close by me , to be sure , but it 's a strange thing that I should just have been tying my brogues . ''"
"`` Can you swear that you do n't know him , Alan ? ''"
"I cried , half angered , half in a mind to laugh at his evasions ."
"`` Not yet , '' says he ; `` but I 've a grand memory for forgetting , David . ''"
"`` And yet there was one thing I saw clearly , '' said I ; `` and that was , that you exposed yourself and me to draw the soldiers . ''"
"`` It 's very likely , '' said Alan ; `` and so would any gentleman ."
You and me were innocent of that transaction . ''
"`` The better reason , since we were falsely suspected , that we should get clear , '' I cried ."
`` One ! ''
-LRB- Slightly had begun to count . -RRB-
"None too soon , Peter , every inch of him on tiptoe , vanished into the cabin ; for more than one pirate was screwing up his courage to look round ."
"They could hear each other 's distressed breathing now , which showed them that the more terrible sound had passed ."
"`` It 's gone , captain , '' Smee said , wiping off his spectacles ."
`` All 's still again . ''
"Slowly Hook let his head emerge from his ruff , and listened so intently that he could have caught the echo of the tick ."
"There was not a sound , and he drew himself up firmly to his full height ."
`` Then here 's to Johnny Plank ! ''
"he cried brazenly , hating the boys more than ever because they had seen him unbend ."
"He broke into the villainous ditty : `` Yo ho , yo ho , the frisky plank , You walks along it so , Till it goes down and you goes down To Davy Jones below ! ''"
"To terrorize the prisoners the more , though with a certain loss of dignity , he danced along an imaginary plank , grimacing at them as he sang ; and when he finished he cried , `` Do you want a touch of the cat -LSB- o ' nine tails -RSB- before you walk the plank ? ''"
At that they fell on their knees .
"`` No , no ! ''"
they cried so piteously that every pirate smiled .
"`` Fetch the cat , Jukes , '' said Hook ; `` it 's in the cabin . ''"
The cabin !
Peter was in the cabin !
The children gazed at each other .
"`` Ay , ay , '' said Jukes blithely , and he strode into the cabin ."
"They followed him with their eyes ; they scarce knew that Hook had resumed his song , his dogs joining in with him : `` Yo ho , yo ho , the scratching cat , Its tails are nine , you know , And when they 're writ upon your back -- '' What was the last line will never be known , for of a sudden the song was stayed by a dreadful screech from the cabin ."
"It wailed through the ship , and died away ."
"Then was heard a crowing sound which was well understood by the boys , but to the pirates was almost more eerie than the screech ."
`` What was that ? ''
cried Hook .
"`` Two , '' said Slightly solemnly ."
The Italian Cecco hesitated for a moment and then swung into the cabin .
"He tottered out , haggard ."
"`` What 's the matter with Bill Jukes , you dog ? ''"
"hissed Hook , towering over him ."
"`` The matter wi ' him is he 's dead , stabbed , '' replied Cecco in a hollow voice ."
`` Bill Jukes dead ! ''
"` What fun , ' he said doubtfully , and they did not dare expose him when Mrs. Darling and Nana returned ."
"` Nana , good dog , ' he said , patting her , ' I have put a little milk into your bowl , Nana . '"
"Nana wagged her tail , ran to the medicine , and began lapping it ."
"Then she gave Mr. Darling such a look , not an angry look : she showed him the great red tear that makes us so sorry for noble dogs , and crept into her kennel ."
"Mr. Darling was frightfully ashamed of himself , but he would not give in ."
In a horrid silence Mrs. Darling smelt the bowl . '
"O George , ' she said , ` it 's your medicine ! '"
"` It was only a joke , ' he roared , while she comforted her boys , and Wendy hugged Nana ."
"` Much good , ' he said bitterly , ` my wearing myself to the bone trying to be funny in this house . '"
And still Wendy hugged Nana .
"` That 's right , ' he shouted ."
` Coddle her !
Nobody coddles me .
Oh dear no !
"I am only the breadwinner , why should I be coddled , why , why , why ! '"
"` George , ' Mrs. Darling entreated him , ` not so loud ; the servants will hear you . '"
Somehow they had got into the way of calling Liza the servants .
"` Let them , ' he answered recklessly ."
` Bring in the whole world .
But I refuse to allow that dog to lord it in my nursery for an hour longer . '
"The children wept , and Nana ran to him beseechingly , but he waved her back ."
He felt he was a strong man again .
"` In vain , in vain , ' he cried ; ` the proper place for you is the yard , and there you go to be tied up this instant . '"
"` George , George , ' Mrs. Darling whispered , ` remember what I told you about that boy . '"
"Alas , he would not listen ."
"He was determined to show who was master in that house , and when commands would not draw Nana from the kennel , he lured her out of it with honeyed words , and seizing her roughly , dragged her from the nursery ."
"He was ashamed of himself , and yet he did it ."
"It was all owing to his too affectionate nature , which craved for admiration ."
"When he had tied her up in the back-yard , the wretched father went and sat in the passage , with his knuckles to his eyes ."
In the meantime Mrs. Darling had put the children to bed in unwonted silence and lit their night-lights .
"They could hear Nana barking , and John whimpered , ` It is because he is chaining her up in the yard , ' but Wendy was wiser ."
"` That is not Nana 's unhappy bark , ' she said , little guessing what was about to happen ; ` that is her bark when she smells danger . '"
"Here Michael , encouraged by his success , breathed so loudly that they were nearly detected ."
"Nana knew that kind of breathing , and she tried to drag herself out of Liza 's clutches ."
But Liza was dense .
"` No more of it , Nana , ' she said sternly , pulling her out of the room . '"
"I warn you if you bark again I shall go straight for master and missus and bring them home from the party , and then , oh , wo n't master whip you , just . '"
"She tied the unhappy dog up again , but do you think Nana ceased to bark ?"
Bring master and missus home from the party !
"Why , that was just what she wanted ."
Do you think she cared whether she was whipped so long as her charges were safe ?
"Unfortunately Liza returned to her puddings , and Nana , seeing that no help would come from her , strained and strained at the chain until at last she broke it ."
"In another moment she had burst into the dining-room of 27 and flung up her paws to heaven , her most expressive way of making a communication ."
"Mr. and Mrs. Darling knew at once that something terrible was happening in their nursery , and without a good-bye to their hostess they rushed into the street ."
But it was now ten minutes since three scoundrels had been breathing behind the curtains ; and Peter Pan can do a great deal in ten minutes .
We now return to the nursery .
"` It 's all right , ' John announced , emerging from his hiding-place . '"
"I say , Peter , can you really fly ? '"
"Instead of troubling to answer him Peter flew round the room , taking the mantelpiece on the way ."
` How topping ! '
said John and Michael .
` How sweet ! '
cried Wendy .
"` Yes , I 'm sweet , oh , I am sweet ! '"
"said Peter , forgetting his manners again ."
"It looked delightfully easy , and they tried it first from the floor and then from the beds , but they always went down instead of up . '"
"I say , how do you do it ? '"
"asked John , rubbing his knee ."
He was quite a practical boy .
"` You just think lovely wonderful thoughts , ' Peter explained , ` and they lift you up in the air . '"
He showed them again .
"` You 're so nippy at it , ' John said ; ` could n't you do it very slowly once ? '"
Peter did it both slowly and quickly .
"` I 've got it now , Wendy ! '"
"`` First ship that ever I lost , '' said Captain Smollett ."
"I was dead tired , as you may fancy ; and when I got to sleep , which was not till after a great deal of tossing , I slept like a log of wood ."
The rest had long been up and had already breakfasted and increased the pile of firewood by about half as much again when I was wakened by a bustle and the sound of voices .
`` Flag of truce ! ''
"I heard someone say ; and then , immediately after , with a cry of surprise , `` Silver himself ! ''"
"And at that , up I jumped , and rubbing my eyes , ran to a loophole in the wall ."
"20 Silver 's Embassy SURE enough , there were two men just outside the stockade , one of them waving a white cloth , the other , no less a person than Silver himself , standing placidly by ."
"It was still quite early , and the coldest morning that I think I ever was abroad in -- a chill that pierced into the marrow ."
"The sky was bright and cloudless overhead , and the tops of the trees shone rosily in the sun ."
"But where Silver stood with his lieutenant , all was still in shadow , and they waded knee-deep in a low white vapour that had crawled during the night out of the morass ."
The chill and the vapour taken together told a poor tale of the island .
"It was plainly a damp , feverish , unhealthy spot ."
"`` Keep indoors , men , '' said the captain ."
`` Ten to one this is a trick . ''
Then he hailed the buccaneer .
`` Who goes ?
"Stand , or we fire . ''"
"`` Flag of truce , '' cried Silver ."
"The captain was in the porch , keeping himself carefully out of the way of a treacherous shot , should any be intended ."
"He turned and spoke to us , `` Doctor 's watch on the lookout ."
"Dr. Livesey take the north side , if you please ; Jim , the east ; Gray , west ."
"The watch below , all hands to load muskets ."
"Lively , men , and careful . ''"
And then he turned again to the mutineers .
`` And what do you want with your flag of truce ? ''
he cried .
This time it was the other man who replied .
"`` Cap'n Silver , sir , to come on board and make terms , '' he shouted ."
`` Cap'n Silver !
Do n't know him .
Who 's he ? ''
cried the captain .
An hour passed away .
`` Hang them ! ''
said the captain .
`` This is as dull as the doldrums .
"Gray , whistle for a wind . ''"
And just at that moment came the first news of the attack .
"`` If you please , sir , '' said Joyce , `` if I see anyone , am I to fire ? ''"
`` I told you so ! ''
cried the captain .
"`` Thank you , sir , '' returned Joyce with the same quiet civility ."
"Nothing followed for a time , but the remark had set us all on the alert , straining ears and eyes -- the musketeers with their pieces balanced in their hands , the captain out in the middle of the block house with his mouth very tight and a frown on his face ."
"So some seconds passed , till suddenly Joyce whipped up his musket and fired ."
"The report had scarcely died away ere it was repeated and repeated from without in a scattering volley , shot behind shot , like a string of geese , from every side of the enclosure ."
"Several bullets struck the log-house , but not one entered ; and as the smoke cleared away and vanished , the stockade and the woods around it looked as quiet and empty as before ."
"Not a bough waved , not the gleam of a musket-barrel betrayed the presence of our foes ."
`` Did you hit your man ? ''
asked the captain .
"`` No , sir , '' replied Joyce ."
"`` I believe not , sir . ''"
"`` Next best thing to tell the truth , '' muttered Captain Smollett ."
"`` Load his gun , Hawkins ."
"How many should say there were on your side , doctor ? ''"
"`` I know precisely , '' said Dr. Livesey ."
`` Three shots were fired on this side .
I saw the three flashes -- two close together -- one farther to the west . ''
`` Three ! ''
repeated the captain .
"`` And how many on yours , Mr. Trelawney ? ''"
But this was not so easily answered .
"There had come many from the north -- seven by the squire 's computation , eight or nine according to Gray ."
From the east and west only a single shot had been fired .
"It was plain , therefore , that the attack would be developed from the north and that on the other three sides we were only to be annoyed by a show of hostilities ."
Then he looked sharply at his ward .
"`` Dick , '' said he , `` Y ' have seen this penny rhyme ? ''"
The lad replied in the affirmative .
"`` It bears your father 's name , '' continued the knight ; `` and our poor shrew of a parson is , by some mad soul , accused of slaying him . ''"
"`` He did most eagerly deny it , '' answered Dick ."
`` He did ? ''
"cried the knight , very sharply ."
`` Heed him not .
He has a loose tongue ; he babbles like a jack-sparrow .
"Some day , when I may find the leisure , Dick , I will myself more fully inform you of these matters ."
"There was one Duckworth shrewdly blamed for it ; but the times were troubled , and there was no justice to be got . ''"
`` It befell at the Moat House ? ''
"Dick ventured , with a beating at his heart ."
"`` It befell between the Moat House and Holywood , '' replied Sir Daniel , calmly ; but he shot a covert glance , black with suspicion , at Dick 's face ."
"`` And now , '' added the knight , `` speed you with your meal ; ye shall return to Tunstall with a line from me . ''"
Dick 's face fell sorely .
"`` Prithee , Sir Daniel , '' he cried , `` send one of the villains !"
I beseech you let me to the battle .
"I can strike a stroke , I promise you . ''"
"`` I misdoubt it not , '' replied Sir Daniel , sitting down to write ."
"`` But here , Dick , is no honour to be won ."
"I lie in Kettley till I have sure tidings of the war , and then ride to join me with the conqueror ."
"Cry not on cowardice ; it is but wisdom , Dick ; for this poor realm so tosseth with rebellion , and the king 's name and custody so changeth hands , that no man may be certain of the morrow ."
"Toss-pot and Shuttle-wit run in , but my Lord Good-Counsel sits o ' one side , waiting . ''"
"With that , Sir Daniel , turning his back to Dick , and quite at the farther end of the long table , began to write his letter , with his mouth on one side , for this business of the Black Arrow stuck sorely in his throat ."
"Meanwhile , young Shelton was going on heartily enough with his breakfast , when he felt a touch upon his arm , and a very soft voice whispering in his ear ."
"`` Make not a sign , I do beseech you , '' said the voice , `` but of your charity tell me the straight way to Holywood ."
"Beseech you , now , good boy , comfort a poor soul in peril and extreme distress , and set me so far forth upon the way to my repose . ''"
"`` Take the path by the windmill , '' answered Dick , in the same tone ; `` it will bring you to Till Ferry ; there inquire again . ''"
"And without turning his head , he fell again to eating ."
But with the tail of his eye he caught a glimpse of the young lad called Master John stealthily creeping from the room .
"`` Why , '' thought Dick , `` he is a young as I. ` Good boy ' doth he call me ?"
A pretty pass the world is coming to !
I 'll never consent to it . ''
"Perhaps if you had searched Greenwood and all the adjacent districts thoroughly you might have found a man who was more astonished and taken aback than old John Ellis was at that moment , but I doubt it ."
The wind was completely taken out of his sails and every bit of the Ellis contrariness was roused .
`` What have you got to say against my son ? ''
he fairly shouted in his rage .
"`` Is n't he good enough for your girl , Susan Oliver , I 'd like to know ? ''"
"`` No , he is n't , '' retorted Miss Susan deliberately and unflinchingly ."
"`` He 's well enough in his place , but you 'll please to remember , John Ellis , that my niece is an Oliver , and the Olivers do n't marry beneath them . ''"
Old John was furious .
`` Beneath them indeed !
"Why , woman , it is condescension in my son to so much as look at your niece -- condescension , that is what it is ."
You are as poor as church mice . ''
"`` We come of good family , though , '' retorted Miss Susan ."
`` You Ellises are nobodies .
Your grandfather was a hired man !
"And yet you have the presumption to think you 're fit to marry into an old , respectable family like the Olivers ."
But talking does n't signify .
I simply wo n't allow this nonsense to go on .
I came here today to tell you so plump and plain .
"It 's your duty to stop it ; if you do n't I will , that 's all . ''"
"`` Oh , will you ? ''"
John Ellis was at a white heat of rage and stubbornness now .
"`` We 'll see , Miss Susan , we 'll see ."
"My son shall marry whatever girl he pleases , and I 'll back him up in it -- do you hear that ?"
Come here and tell me my son is n't good enough for your niece indeed !
I 'll show you he can get her anyway . ''
"`` You 've heard what I 've said , '' was the answer , `` and you 'd better go by it , that 's all ."
"I sha n't stay to bandy words with you , John Ellis ."
"I 'm going home to talk to my niece and tell her her duty plain , and what I want her to do , and she 'll do it , I have n't a fear . ''"
"Miss Susan was halfway down the steps , but John Ellis ran to the railing of the verandah to get the last word ."
"`` I 'll send Burton down this evening to talk to her and tell her what he wants her to do , and we 'll see whether she 'll sooner listen to you than to him , '' he shouted ."
"`` Stand back , by ' r Lady ! ''"
"returned Dick , raising his bow ."
"`` Ah , y ' are a brave boy ! ''"
retorted Matcham .
`` Shoot ! ''
Dick lowered his weapon in some confusion .
"`` See here , '' he said ."
`` Y ' have done me ill enough .
"Go , then ."
"Go your way in fair wise ; or , whether I will or not , I must even drive you to it . ''"
"`` Well , '' said Matcham , doggedly , `` y ' are the stronger ."
Do your worst .
"I shall not leave to follow thee , Dick , unless thou makest me , '' he added ."
Dick was almost beside himself .
"It went against his heart to beat a creature so defenceless ; and , for the life of him , he knew no other way to rid himself of this unwelcome and , as he began to think , perhaps untrue companion ."
"`` Y ' are mad , I think , '' he cried ."
"`` Fool-fellow , I am hasting to your foes ; as fast as foot can carry me , go I thither . ''"
"`` I care not , Dick , '' replied the lad ."
"`` If y ' are bound to die , Dick , I 'll die too ."
I would liever go with you to prison than to go free without you . ''
"`` Well , '' returned the other , `` I may stand no longer prating ."
"Follow me , if ye must ; but if ye play me false , it shall but little advance you , mark ye that ."
"Shalt have a quarrel in thine inwards , boy . ''"
"So saying , Dick took once more to his heels , keeping in the margin of the thicket and looking briskly about him as he went ."
"At a good pace he rattled out of the dell , and came again into the more open quarters of the wood ."
"To the left a little eminence appeared , spotted with golden gorse , and crowned with a black tuft of firs ."
"`` I shall see from there , '' he thought , and struck for it across a heathy clearing ."
"He had gone but a few yards , when Matcham touched him on the arm , and pointed ."
"To the eastward of the summit there was a dip , and , as it were , a valley passing to the other side ; the heath was not yet out ; all the ground was rusty , like an unscoured buckler , and dotted sparingly with yews ; and there , one following another , Dick saw half a score green jerkins mounting the ascent , and marching at their head , conspicuous by his boar-spear , Ellis Duckworth in person ."
"One after another gained the top , showed for a moment against the sky , and then dipped upon the further side , until the last was gone ."
Dick looked at Matcham with a kindlier eye .
"`` So y ' are to be true to me , Jack ? ''"
"He rushed to Anne , hurled himself into her lap , flung his arms around her neck , and burst into tears ."
"`` I did n't know it was wrong to tell whoppers , '' he sobbed ."
`` How did you expect me to know it was wrong ?
"All Mr. Sprott 's children told them REGULAR every day , and cross their hearts too ."
"I s ` pose Paul Irving never tells whoppers and here I 've been trying awful hard to be as good as him , but now I s ` pose you 'll never love me again ."
But I think you might have told me it was wrong .
"I 'm awful sorry I 've made you cry , Anne , and I 'll never tell a whopper again . ''"
Davy buried his face in Anne 's shoulder and cried stormily .
"Anne , in a sudden glad flash of understanding , held him tight and looked over his curly thatch at Marilla ."
"`` He did n't know it was wrong to tell falsehoods , Marilla ."
I think we must forgive him for that part of it this time if he will promise never to say what is n't true again . ''
"`` I never will , now that I know it 's bad , '' asseverated Davy between sobs ."
"`` If you ever catch me telling a whopper again you can ... '' Davy groped mentally for a suitable penance ... `` you can skin me alive , Anne . ''"
"`` Do n't say ` whopper , ' Davy ... say ` falsehood , ' '' said the schoolma'am ."
`` Why ? ''
"queried Davy , settling comfortably down and looking up with a tearstained , investigating face ."
`` Why ai n't whopper as good as falsehood ?
I want to know .
It 's just as big a word . ''
`` It 's slang ; and it 's wrong for little boys to use slang . ''
"`` There 's an awful lot of things it 's wrong to do , '' said Davy with a sigh ."
`` I never s ` posed there was so many .
"I 'm sorry it 's wrong to tell whop ... falsehoods , 'cause it 's awful handy , but since it is I 'm never going to tell any more ."
What are you going to do to me for telling them this time ?
I want to know . ''
Anne looked beseechingly at Marilla .
"`` I do n't want to be too hard on the child , '' said Marilla ."
"`` I daresay nobody ever did tell him it was wrong to tell lies , and those Sprott children were no fit companions for him ."
Poor Mary was too sick to train him properly and I presume you could n't expect a six-year-old child to know things like that by instinct .
I suppose we 'll just have to assume he does n't know ANYTHING right and begin at the beginning .
"But he 'll have to be punished for shutting Dora up , and I ca n't think of any way except to send him to bed without his supper and we 've done that so often ."
"Ca n't you suggest something else , Anne ?"
"`` It was a coward blow , '' returned Matcham ."
"`` Y ' are but a lout and bully , Master Dick ; ye but abuse advantages ; let there come a stronger , we will see you truckle at his boot !"
"Ye care not for vengeance , neither -- for your father 's death that goes unpaid , and his poor ghost that clamoureth for justice ."
"But if there come but a poor creature in your hands that lacketh skill and strength , and would befriend you , down she shall go ! ''"
Dick was too furious to observe that `` she . ''
`` Marry ! ''
"he cried , `` and here is news !"
Of any two the one will still be stronger .
"The better man throweth the worse , and the worse is well served ."
"Ye deserve a belting , Master Matcham , for your ill-guidance and unthankfulness to meward ; and what ye deserve ye shall have . ''"
"And Dick , who , even in his angriest temper , still preserved the appearance of composure , began to unbuckle his belt ."
"`` Here shall be your supper , '' he said , grimly ."
"Matcham had stopped his tears ; he was as white as a sheet , but he looked Dick steadily in the face , and never moved ."
"Dick took a step , swinging the belt ."
"Then he paused , embarrassed by the large eyes and the thin , weary face of his companion ."
His courage began to subside .
"`` Say ye were in the wrong , then , '' he said , lamely ."
"`` Nay , '' said Matcham , `` I was in the right ."
"Come , cruel !"
"I be lame ; I be weary ; I resist not ; I ne'er did thee hurt ; come , beat me -- coward ! ''"
"Dick raised the belt at this last provocation , but Matcham winced and drew himself together with so cruel an apprehension , that his heart failed him yet again ."
"The strap fell by his side , and he stood irresolute , feeling like a fool ."
"`` A plague upon thee , shrew ! ''"
he said .
"`` An ye be so feeble of hand , ye should keep the closer guard upon your tongue ."
But I 'll be hanged before I beat you ! ''
and he put on his belt again .
"`` Beat you I will not , '' he continued ; `` but forgive you ?"
-- never .
"I knew ye not ; ye were my master 's enemy ; I lent you my horse ; my dinner ye have eaten ; y ' ` ave called me a man o ' wood , a coward , and a bully ."
"Nay , by the mass !"
"the measure is filled , and runneth over ."
You were quite glad that the night-lights were in .
"You even liked Nana to say that this was just the mantelpiece over here , and that the Neverland was all make-believe ."
"Of course the Neverland had been make-believe in those days ; but it was real now , and there were no night-lights , and it was getting darker every moment , and where was Nana ?"
"They had been flying apart , but they huddled close to Peter now ."
"His careless manner had gone at last , his eyes were sparkling , and a tingle went through them every time they touched his body ."
"They were now over the fearsome island , flying so low that sometimes a tree grazed their feet ."
"Nothing horrid was visible in the air , yet their progress had become slow and laboured , exactly as if they were pushing their way through hostile forces ."
Sometimes they hung in the air until Peter had beaten on it with his fists .
"` They do n't want us to land , ' he explained ."
` Who are they ? '
"Wendy whispered , shuddering ."
But he could not or would not say .
"Tinker Bell had been asleep on his shoulder , but now he wakened her and sent her on in front ."
"Sometimes he poised himself in the air , listening intently with his hand to his ear , and again he would stare down with eyes so bright that they seemed to bore two holes to earth ."
"Having done these things , he went on again ."
His courage was almost appalling .
"` Do you want an adventure now , ' he said casually to John , ` or would you like to have your tea first ? '"
"Wendy said ` tea first ' quickly , and Michael pressed her hand in gratitude , but the braver John hesitated ."
` What kind of adventure ? '
he asked cautiously .
"` There 's a pirate asleep in the pampas just beneath us , ' Peter told him ."
"` If you like , we 'll go down and kill him . ' '"
"I do n't see him , ' John said after a long pause . '"
I do . '
"` Suppose , ' John said a little huskily , ` he were to wake up . '"
Peter spoke indignantly .
` You do n't think I would kill him while he was sleeping !
"I would wake him first , and then kill him ."
That 's the way I always do . ' '
I say !
Do you kill many ? '
` Tons . '
"` Yes , I shall only bring a fairy story for my dowry , ' said he , and so they parted ."
But the princess gave him a sabre set with gold pieces which he could use .
"Then he flew away , bought himself a new dressing-gown , and sat down in the wood and began to make up a story , for it had to be ready by Saturday , and that was no easy matter ."
When he had it ready it was Saturday .
"The sultan , the sultana , and the whole court were at tea with the princess ."
He was most graciously received .
` Will you tell us a story ? '
said the sultana ; ` one that is thoughtful and instructive ? '
"` But something that we can laugh at , ' said the sultan ."
"` Oh , certainly , ' he replied , and began : ` Now , listen attentively ."
"There was once a box of matches which lay between a tinder-box and an old iron pot , and they told the story of their youth . '"
`` We used to be on the green fir-boughs .
"Every morning and evening we had diamond-tea , which was the dew , and the whole day long we had sunshine , and the little birds used to tell us stories ."
"We were very rich , because the other trees only dressed in summer , but we had green dresses in summer and in winter ."
"Then the woodcutter came , and our family was split up ."
We have now the task of making light for the lowest people .
That is why we grand people are in the kitchen . '' '
"`` My fate was quite different , '' said the iron pot , near which the matches lay . '"
"`` Since I came into the world I have been many times scoured , and have cooked much ."
My only pleasure is to have a good chat with my companions when I am lying nice and clean in my place after dinner . '' '
"`` Now you are talking too fast , '' spluttered the fire . '"
"`` Yes , let us decide who is the grandest ! ''"
said the matches . '
"`` No , I do n't like talking about myself , '' said the pot . '"
`` Let us arrange an evening 's entertainment .
I will tell the story of my life . '
`` On the Baltic by the Danish shore - '' ` What a beautiful beginning ! ''
said all the plates .
`` That 's a story that will please us all . ''
` And the end was just as good as the beginning .
All the plates clattered for joy . '
"`` Now I will dance , '' said the tongs , and she danced ."
`` And then Susan gave up .
` We can not save him !
"Oh , if your father was here -- look at him , the poor little fellow !"
I know not what to do . '
`` I looked at Jims and I thought he was dying .
"Susan was holding him up in his crib to give him a better chance for breath , but it did n't seem as if he could breathe at all ."
"My little war-baby , with his dear ways and sweet roguish face , was choking to death before my very eyes , and I could n't help him ."
I threw down the hot poultice I had ready in despair .
Of what use was it ?
"Jims was dying , and it was my fault -- I had n't been careful enough !"
`` Just then -- at eleven o'clock at night -- the door bell rang .
Such a ring -- it pealed all over the house above the roar of the storm .
Susan could n't go -- she dared not lay Jims down -- so I rushed downstairs .
In the hall I paused just a minute -- I was suddenly overcome by an absurd dread .
I thought of a weird story Gertrude had told me once .
An aunt of hers was alone in a house one night with her sick husband .
She heard a knock at the door .
"And when she went and opened it there was nothing there -- nothing that could be seen , at least ."
"But when she opened the door a deadly cold wind blew in and seemed to sweep past her right up the stairs , although it was a calm , warm summer night outside ."
Immediately she heard a cry .
She ran upstairs -- and her husband was dead .
"And she always believed , so Gertrude said , that when she opened that door she let Death in ."
`` It was so ridiculous of me to feel so frightened .
"But I was distracted and worn out , and I simply felt for a moment that I dared not open the door -- that death was waiting outside ."
Then I remembered that I had no time to waste -- must not be so foolish -- I sprang forward and opened the door .
`` Certainly a cold wind did blow in and filled the hall with a whirl of snow .
"But there on the threshold stood a form of flesh and blood -- Mary Vance , coated from head to foot with snow -- and she brought Life , not Death , with her , though I did n't know that then ."
I just stared at her . '' '
"I have n't been turned out , ' grinned Mary , as she stepped in and shut the door . '"
I came up to Carter Flagg 's two days ago and I 've been stormed-stayed there ever since .
"But old Abbie Flagg got on my nerves at last , and tonight I just made up my mind to come up here ."
"I thought I could wade this far , but I can tell you it was as much as a bargain ."
Also that there were very few birds in winter .
"` Of course they might want your clothes , ' he had to admit rather falteringly ."
She was somewhat indignant at this .
"` They are always thinking of their nests , ' he said apologetically , ` and there are some bits of you ' -- he stroked the fur on her pelisse -- ` that would excite them very much . '"
"` They sha n't have my fur , ' she said sharply ."
"` No , ' he said , still fondling it , however , ` no ."
"O Maimie , ' he said rapturously , ` do you know why I love you ?"
It is because you are like a beautiful nest . '
Somehow this made her uneasy . '
"I think you are speaking more like a bird than a boy now , ' she said , holding back , and indeed he was even looking rather like a bird ."
"` After all , ' she said , ` you are only a Betwixt-and-Between . '"
"But it hurt him so much that she immediately added , ` It must be a delicious thing to be . '"
"` Come and be one , then , dear Maimie , ' he implored her , and they set off for the boat , for it was now very near Open-Gate time ."
"` And you are not a bit like a nest , ' he whispered to please her ."
"` But I think it is rather nice to be like one , ' she said in a woman 's contradictory way ."
"` And , Peter , dear , though I ca n't give them my fur , I would n't mind their building in it ."
Fancy a nest in my neck with little spotty eggs in it !
"O Peter , how perfectly lovely ! '"
"-LSB- Illustration : Building the house for Maimie -RSB- But as they drew near the Serpentine , she shivered a little , and said , ` Of course I shall go and see mother often , quite often ."
"It is not as if I was saying good-bye for ever to mother , it is not in the least like that . '"
"` Oh no , ' answered Peter , but in his heart he knew it was very like that , and he would have told her so had he not been in a quaking fear of losing her ."
"He was so fond of her , he felt he could not live without her ."
"` She will forget her mother in time , and be happy with me , ' he kept saying to himself , and he hurried her on , giving her thimbles by the way ."
"But even when she had seen the boat and exclaimed ecstatically over its loveliness , she still talked tremblingly about her mother ."
"` You know quite well , Peter , do n't you , ' she said , ` that I would n't come unless I knew for certain I could go back to mother whenever I want to ?"
"Peter , say it . '"
"He said it , but he could no longer look her in the face ."
"` If you are sure your mother will always want you , ' he added rather sourly ."
` The idea of mother 's not always wanting me ! '
"Maimie cried , and her face glistened ."
"` If she does n't bar you out , ' said Peter huskily ."
"` The door , ' replied Maimie , ` will always , always be open , and mother will always be waiting at it for me . '"
"`` That wo n't do with me , my man , '' interrupted the captain ."
"`` We know exactly what you meant to do , and we do n't care , for now , you see , you ca n't do it . ''"
And the captain looked at him calmly and proceeded to fill a pipe .
`` If Abe Gray -- '' Silver broke out .
`` Avast there ! ''
cried Mr. Smollett .
"`` Gray told me nothing , and I asked him nothing ; and what 's more , I would see you and him and this whole island blown clean out of the water into blazes first ."
"So there 's my mind for you , my man , on that . ''"
This little whiff of temper seemed to cool Silver down .
"He had been growing nettled before , but now he pulled himself together ."
"`` Like enough , '' said he ."
"`` I would set no limits to what gentlemen might consider shipshape , or might not , as the case were ."
"And seein ' as how you are about to take a pipe , cap'n , I 'll make so free as do likewise . ''"
"And he filled a pipe and lighted it ; and the two men sat silently smoking for quite a while , now looking each other in the face , now stopping their tobacco , now leaning forward to spit ."
It was as good as the play to see them .
"`` Now , '' resumed Silver , `` here it is ."
"You give us the chart to get the treasure by , and drop shooting poor seamen and stoving of their heads in while asleep ."
"You do that , and we 'll offer you a choice ."
"Either you come aboard along of us , once the treasure shipped , and then I 'll give you my affy-davy , upon my word of honour , to clap you somewhere safe ashore ."
"Or if that ai n't to your fancy , some of my hands being rough and having old scores on account of hazing , then you can stay here , you can ."
"We 'll divide stores with you , man for man ; and I 'll give my affy-davy , as before to speak the first ship I sight , and send 'em here to pick you up ."
"Now , you 'll own that 's talking ."
"Handsomer you could n't look to get , now you ."
"And I hope '' -- raising his voice -- `` that all hands in this here block house will overhaul my words , for what is spoke to one is spoke to all . ''"
Captain Smollett rose from his seat and knocked out the ashes of his pipe in the palm of his left hand .
`` Is that all ? ''
he asked .
"`` Every last word , by thunder ! ''"
answered John .
"`` Refuse that , and you 've seen the last of me but musket-balls . ''"
"`` Very good , '' said the captain ."
`` Now you 'll hear me .
Smee had listened with growing admiration .
"` It 's the wickedest , prettiest policy ever I heard of , ' he cried , and in their exultation they danced and sang : ` Avast , belay , when I appear , By fear they 're overtook ; Nought 's left upon your bones when you Have shaken claws with Cook . '"
"They began the verse , but they never finished it , for another sound broke in and stilled them ."
"It was at first such a tiny sound that a leaf might have fallen on it and smothered it , but as it came nearer it was more distinct ."
Tick tick tick tick .
"Hook stood shuddering , one foot in the air ."
"` The crocodile , ' he gasped , and bounded away , followed by his bo ` sun ."
It was indeed the crocodile .
"It had passed the redskins , who were now on the trail of the other pirates ."
It oozed on after Hook .
"Once more the boys emerged into the open ; but the dangers of the night were not yet over , for presently Nibs rushed breathless into their midst , pursued by a pack of wolves ."
The tongues of the pursuers were hanging out ; the baying of them was horrible .
"` Save me , save me ! '"
"cried Nibs , falling on the ground ."
"` But what can we do , what can we do ? '"
It was a high compliment to Peter that at that dire moment their thoughts turned to him .
` What would Peter do ? '
they cried simultaneously .
"Almost in the same breath they added , ` Peter would look at them through his legs . '"
"And then , ` Let us do what Peter would do . '"
"It is quite the most successful way of defying wolves , and as one boy they bent and looked through their legs ."
"The next moment is the long one ; but victory came quickly , for as the boys advanced upon them in this terrible attitude , the wolves dropped their tails and fled ."
"Now Nibs rose from the ground , and the others thought that his staring eyes still saw the wolves ."
But it was not wolves he saw . '
"I have seen a wonderfuller thing , ' he cried , as they gathered round him eagerly . '"
A great white bird .
It is flying this way . '
"` What kind of a bird , do you think ? ' '"
"I do n't know , ' Nibs said , awestruck , ` but it looks so weary , and as it flies it moans , `` Poor Wendy . '' '"
` Poor Wendy ? ' '
"I remember , ' said Slightly instantly , ` there are birds called Wendies . '"
"` See , it comes , ' cried Curly , pointing to Wendy in the heavens ."
"I had heard the word , and I knew it stood for a horrible kind of punishment common enough among the buccaneers , in which the offender is put ashore with a little powder and shot and left behind on some desolate and distant island ."
"`` Marooned three years agone , '' he continued , `` and lived on goats since then , and berries , and oysters ."
"Wherever a man is , says I , a man can do for himself ."
"But , mate , my heart is sore for Christian diet ."
"You might n't happen to have a piece of cheese about you , now ?"
No ?
"Well , many 's the long night I 've dreamed of cheese -- toasted , mostly -- and woke up again , and here I were . ''"
"`` If ever I can get aboard again , '' said I , `` you shall have cheese by the stone . ''"
"All this time he had been feeling the stuff of my jacket , smoothing my hands , looking at my boots , and generally , in the intervals of his speech , showing a childish pleasure in the presence of a fellow creature ."
But at my last words he perked up into a kind of startled slyness .
"`` If ever you can get aboard again , says you ? ''"
he repeated .
"`` Why , now , who 's to hinder you ? ''"
"`` Not you , I know , '' was my reply ."
"`` And right you was , '' he cried ."
"`` Now you -- what do you call yourself , mate ? ''"
"`` Jim , '' I told him ."
"`` Jim , Jim , '' says he , quite pleased apparently ."
"`` Well , now , Jim , I 've lived that rough as you 'd be ashamed to hear of ."
"Now , for instance , you would n't think I had had a pious mother -- to look at me ? ''"
he asked .
"`` Why , no , not in particular , '' I answered ."
"`` Ah , well , '' said he , `` but I had -- remarkable pious ."
"And I was a civil , pious boy , and could rattle off my catechism that fast , as you could n't tell one word from another ."
"And here 's what it come to , Jim , and it begun with chuck-farthen on the blessed grave-stones !"
"That 's what it begun with , but it went further 'n that ; and so my mother told me , and predicked the whole , she did , the pious woman !"
But it were Providence that put me here .
"I 've thought it all out in this here lonely island , and I 'm back on piety ."
"You do n't catch me tasting rum so much , but just a thimbleful for luck , of course , the first chance I have ."
"I 'm bound I 'll be good , and I see the way to ."
"And , Jim '' -- looking all round him and lowering his voice to a whisper -- `` I 'm rich . ''"
"I now felt sure that the poor fellow had gone crazy in his solitude , and I suppose I must have shown the feeling in my face , for he repeated the statement hotly : `` Rich !"
And he pinched me again in the most confidential manner .
"`` Then , '' he continued , `` then you 'll up , and you 'll say this : Gunn is a good man -LRB- you 'll say -RRB- , and he puts a precious sight more confidence -- a precious sight , mind that -- in a gen ` leman born than in these gen ` leman of fortune , having been one hisself . ''"
"`` Well , '' I said , `` I do n't understand one word that you 've been saying ."
But that 's neither here nor there ; for how am I to get on board ? ''
"`` Ah , '' said he , `` that 's the hitch , for sure ."
"Well , there 's my boat , that I made with my two hands ."
I keep her under the white rock .
"If the worst come to the worst , we might try that after dark ."
Hi ! ''
he broke out .
`` What 's that ? ''
"For just then , although the sun had still an hour or two to run , all the echoes of the island awoke and bellowed to the thunder of a cannon ."
`` They have begun to fight ! ''
I cried .
`` Follow me . ''
"And I began to run towards the anchorage , my terrors all forgotten , while close at my side the marooned man in his goatskins trotted easily and lightly ."
"`` Left , left , '' says he ; `` keep to your left hand , mate Jim !"
Under the trees with you !
Theer 's where I killed my first goat .
They do n't come down here now ; they 're all mastheaded on them mountings for the fear of Benjamin Gunn .
Ah !
"And there 's the cetemery '' -- cemetery , he must have meant ."
`` You see the mounds ?
"I come here and prayed , nows and thens , when I thought maybe a Sunday would be about doo ."
"It were n't quite a chapel , but it seemed more solemn like ; and then , says you , Ben Gunn was short-handed -- no chapling , nor so much as a Bible and a flag , you says . ''"
"So he kept talking as I ran , neither expecting nor receiving any answer ."
The cannon-shot was followed after a considerable interval by a volley of small arms .
"Another pause , and then , not a quarter of a mile in front of me , I beheld the Union Jack flutter in the air above a wood ."
PART FOUR -- The Stockade 16 Narrative Continued by the Doctor : How the Ship Was Abandoned IT was about half past one -- three bells in the sea phrase -- that the two boats went ashore from the HISPANIOLA .
"The captain , the squire , and I were talking matters over in the cabin ."
"Had there been a breath of wind , we should have fallen on the six mutineers who were left aboard with us , slipped our cable , and away to sea ."
"But the wind was wanting ; and to complete our helplessness , down came Hunter with the news that Jim Hawkins had slipped into a boat and was gone ashore with the rest ."
Your voice is like music and your eyes are like pansies when the dew is on them .
You are like a tall stately queen .
Your hair is like rippling gold .
"Anthony Pye says it is red , but you need n't pay any attention to Anthony . '' '"
I have only known you for a few months but I can not realize that there was ever a time when I did not know you ... when you had not come into my life to bless and hallow it .
I will always look back to this year as the most wonderful in my life because it brought you to me .
"Besides , it 's the year we moved to Avonlea from Newbridge ."
My love for you has made my life very rich and it has kept me from much of harm and evil .
"I owe this all to you , my sweetest teacher . '' '"
I shall never forget how sweet you looked the last time I saw you in that black dress with flowers in your hair .
"I shall see you like that for ever , even when we are both old and gray ."
"You will always be young and fair to me , dearest teacher ."
I am thinking of you all the time ... in the morning and at the noontide and at the twilight .
I love you when you laugh and when you sigh ... even when you look disdainful .
I never saw you look cross though Anthony Pye says you always look so but I do n't wonder you look cross at him for he deserves it .
I love you in every dress ... you seem more adorable in each new dress than the last . ''
"` Dearest teacher , good night ."
The sun has set and the stars are shining ... stars that are as bright and beautiful as your eyes .
"I kiss your hands and face , my sweet ."
May God watch over you and protect you from all harm . ''
"`` Your afecksionate pupil , '' ` Annetta Bell . ' ''"
`` This extraordinary letter puzzled me not a little .
I knew Annetta could n't have composed it any more than she could fly .
When I went to school the next day I took her for a walk down to the brook at recess and asked her to tell me the truth about the letter .
Annetta cried and ` fessed up freely .
"She said she had never written a letter and she did n't know how to , or what to say , but there was bundle of love letters in her mother 's top bureau drawer which had been written to her by an old ` beau . ' ''"
"` It was n't father , ' sobbed Annetta , ` it was someone who was studying for a minister , and so he could write lovely letters , but ma did n't marry him after all ."
She said she could n't make out what he was driving at half the time .
But I thought the letters were sweet and that I 'd just copy things out of them here and there to write you .
I put `` teacher '' where he put `` lady '' and I put in something of my own when I could think of it and I changed some words .
I put `` dress '' in place of `` mood . ''
I did n't know just what a `` mood '' was but I s ` posed it was something to wear .
I have lost my favourite ring ; DO stop for a moment and look if you can see it . '
But Jose answered : ` You will find plenty of rings where you are going . '
And the horse galloped on .
"At last they entered the palace gates , and the king 's heart bounded with joy at beholding his beloved Princess Bella-Flor ."
"But the princess brushed him aside as if he had been a fly , and locked herself into the nearest room , which she would not open for all his entreaties ."
"` Bring me the three things I lost on the way , and perhaps I may think about it , ' was all she would say ."
"And , in despair , the king was driven to take counsel of Jose ."
"` There is no remedy that I can see , ' said his majesty , ` but that you , who know where they are , should go and bring them back ."
And if you return without them I will have you drowned . '
Poor Jose was much troubled at these words .
"He thought that he had done all that was required of him , and that his life was safe ."
"However , he bowed low , and went out to consult his friend the horse ."
"` Do not vex yourself , ' said the horse , when he had heard the story ; ` jump up , and we will go and look for the things . '"
And Jose mounted at once .
"They rode on till they came to the ant-hill , and then the horse asked : ` Would you like to have the bran ? '"
` What is the use of liking ? '
answered Jose .
"` Well , call the ants , and tell them to fetch it for you ; and , if some of it has been scattered by the wind , to bring in its stead the grains that were in the cakes you gave them . '"
Jose listened in surprise .
"He did not much believe in the horse 's plan ; but he could not think of anything better , so he called to the ants , and bade them collect the bran as fast as they could ."
"Then he saw under a tree and waited , while his horse cropped the green turf ."
` Look there ! '
"said the animal , suddenly raising its head ; and Jose looked behind him and saw a little mountain of bran , which he put into a bag that was hung over his saddle ."
"` Good deeds bear fruit sooner or later , ' observed the horse ; ` but mount again , as we have far to go . '"
"When they arrived at the tree , they saw the handkerchief fluttering like a flag from the topmost branch , and Jose 's spirits sank again ."
` How am I to get that handkerchief ? '
cried he ; ` why I should need Jacob 's ladder ! '
"But the horse answered : ` Do not be frightened ; call to the eagle you set free from the net , he will bring it to you . '"
"So Jose called to the eagle , and the eagle flew to the top of the tree and brought back the handkerchief in its beak ."
"Jose thanked him , and vaulting on his horse they rode on to the river ."
"A great deal of rain had fallen in the night , and the river , instead of being clear as it was before , was dark and troubled ."
"` How am I to fetch the ring from the bottom of this river when I do not know exactly where it was dropped , and can not even see it ? '"
"Turning their backs with snippy glee, that Pig said, ""Not I,"""
"and that Cat said, ""Not I,"" and that Rat said, ""Not I."""
"So the good Little Red Hen could do nothing but say, ""I will then."""
And she did.
"Carrying the sack of Wheat, she trudged off to the distant mill. There she ordered the Wheat ground into beautiful white flour. When the miller brought her the flour she walked slowly back all the way to her own barnyard in her own picketty-pecketty fashion."
"She even managed, in spite of her load, to catch a nice juicy worm now and then and had one left for the babies when she reached them. Those cunning little fluff-balls were so glad to see their mother. For the first time, they really appreciated her.After this really strenuous day Mrs. Hen retired to her slumbers earlier than usual indeed, before the colors came into the sky to herald the setting of the sun, her usual bedtime hour."
"She would have liked to sleep late in the morning, but her chicks, joining in the morning chorus of the hen yard, drove away all hopes of such a luxury."
"Even as she sleepily half opened one eye, the thought came to her that to-day that Wheat must, somehow, be made into bread."
"She was not in the habit of making bread, although, of course, anyone can make it if he or she follows the recipe with care, and she knew perfectly well that she could do it if necessary."
"So after her children were fed and made sweet and fresh for the day, she hunted up the Pig, the Cat and the Rat."
"Still confident that they would surely help her some day she sang out, ""Who will make the bread?"""
"Alas for the Little Red Hen! Once more her hopes were dashed! For the Pig said, ""Not I,""the Cat said, ""Not I,"" and the Rat said, ""Not I."""
"So the Little Red Hen said once more, ""I will then,"" and she did."
"Feeling that she might have known all the time that she would have to do it all herself, she went and put on a fresh apron and spotless cook's cap. First of all she set the dough, as was proper. When it was time she brought out the moulding board and the baking tins, moulded the bread, divided it into loaves, and put them into the oven to bake."
"All the while the Cat sat lazily by, giggling and chuckling.And close at hand the vain Rat powdered his nose and admired himself in a mirror."
In the distance could be heard the long-drawn snores of the dozing Pig.
At last the great moment arrived. A delicious odor was wafted upon the autumn breeze. Everywhere the barnyard citizens sniffed the air with delight.
The Red Hen ambled in her picketty-pecketty way toward the source of all this excitement.
"Although she appeared to be perfectly calm, in reality she could only with difficulty restrain an impulse to dance and sing, for had she not done all the work on this wonderful bread?"
Small wonder that she was the most excited person in the barnyard!
"She did not know whether the bread would be fit to eat, but joy of joys! when the lovely brown loaves came out of the oven, they were done to perfection."
"Then, probably because she had acquired the habit, the Red Hen called:"
"""Who will eat the Bread?"""
"All the animals in the barnyard were watching hungrily and smacking their lips in anticipation, and the Pig said, ""I will,"" the Cat said, ""I will,"" the Rat said, ""I will."""
"But the Little Red Hen said,"
"""No, you won't. I will."""
And she did.
OLD TALES FROM THE NORTH
EAST OF THE SUN AND WEST OF THE MOON
"Once on a time there was a poor husbandman who had so many children that he hadn't much of either food or clothing to give them. Pretty children they all were, but the prettiest was the youngest daughter, who was so lovely there was no end to her loveliness."
"""You'll let me fall if you carry me like that. I won't go with you!"""
"""Don't be afraid! I'll hold you quite tight all the way."""
"Then said the crab to himself, ""If this fellow once got hold of fish, he would never let them go in a pond! Now if he should really put me into the pond, it would be capital; but if he doesn't then I'll cut his throat, and kill him!"" So he said to him:"
"""Look here, friend, you won't be able to hold me tight enough; but we crabs have a famous grip. If you let me catch hold of you round the neck with my claws, I shall be glad to go with you."""
"And the other did not see that he was trying to outwit him, and agreed. So the crab caught hold of his neck with his claws as securely as with a pair of blacksmith's pincers, and called out, ""Off with you, now!"""
"And the crane took him and showed him the pond, and then turned off towards the Varana-tree."
"""Uncle!"" cried the crab, ""the pond lies that way, but you are taking me this way!"""
"""Oh, that's it, is it?"" answered the crane. ""Your dear little uncle, your very sweet nephew, you call me! You mean me to understand, I suppose, that I am your slave, who has to lift you up and carry you about with him! Now cast your eye upon the heap of fish-bones lying at the root of yonder Varana-tree. Just as I have eaten those fish, every one of them, just so I will devour you as well!"""
"""Ah! those fishes got eaten through their own stupidity,"" answered the crab; ""but I'm not going to let you eat me. On the contrary, is it you that I am going to destroy. For you in your folly have not seen that I was outwitting you. If we die, we die both together; for I will cut off this head of yours, and cast it to the ground!"" And so saying, he gave the crane's neck a grip with his claws, as with a vice."
"Then gasping, and with tears trickling from his eyes, and trembling with the fear of death, the crane beseeched him, saying, ""O my Lord!"
"Indeed I did not intend to eat you. Grant me my life!"""
"""Well, well! step down into the pond, and put me in there."""
"And he turned round and stepped down into the pond, and placed the crab on the mud at its edge. But the crab cut through its neck as clean as one would cut a lotus-stalk with a hunting-knife, and then only entered the water!"
"When the Genius who lived in the Varana-tree saw this strange affair, he made the wood resound with his plaudits, uttering in a pleasant voice the verse:"
"""The villain, though exceeding clever,     Shall prosper not by his villainy."
"He may win indeed, sharp-witted in deceit,     But only as the Crane here from the Crab!"""

"Once there was a king called King Dantal, who had a great many rupees and soldiers and horses. He had also an only son called Prince Majnun, who was a handsome boy with white teeth, red lips, blue eyes, red cheeks, red hair, and a white skin. This boy was very fond of playing with the Wazir's son, Husain Mahamat, in King Dantal's garden, which was very large and full of delicious fruits, and flowers, and trees."
They used to take their little knives there and cut the fruits and eat them. King Dantal had a teacher for them to teach them to read and write.
"One day, when they were grown two fine young men, Prince Majnun said to his father, ""Husain Mahamat and I should like to go and hunt."" His father said they might go, so they got ready their horses and all else they wanted for their hunting, and went to the Phalana country, hunting all the way, but they only founds jackals and birds."
"The Raja of the Phalana country was called Munsuk Raja, and he had a daughter named Laili, who was very beautiful; she had brown eyes and black hair."
"One night, some time before Prince Majnun came to her father's kingdom, as she slept, Khuda sent to her an angel in the form of a man who told her that she should marry Prince Majnun and no one else, and that this was Khuda's command to her. When Laili woke she told her father of the angel's visit to her as she slept; but her father paid no attention to her story. From that time she began repeating, ""Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun,"" and would say nothing else. Even as she sat and ate her food she kept saying, ""Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun."" Her father used to get quite vexed with her. ""Who is this Majnun? who ever heard of this Majnun?"" he would say."
"""He is the man I am to marry,"" said Laili. ""Khuda has ordered me to marry no one but Majnun."" And she was half mad."
"Meanwhile, Majnun and Husain Mahamat came to hunt in the Phalana country; and as they were riding about, Laili came out on her horse to eat the air, and rode behind them. All the time she kept saying, ""Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun."" The prince heard her, and turned round. ""Who is calling me?"" he asked. At this Laili looked at him, and the moment she saw him she fell deeply in love with him, and she said to herself, ""I am sure that is the Prince Majnun that Khuda says I am to marry."" And she went home to her father and said, ""Father, I wish to marry the prince who has come to your kingdom; for I know he is the Prince Majnun I am to marry."""
"""Very well, you shall have him for your husband,"" said Munsuk Raja."
"""We will ask him to-morrow."" Laili consented to wait, although she was very impatient. As it happened, the prince left the Phalana kingdom that night, and when Laili heard he was gone, she went quite mad. She would not listen to a word her father, or her mother, or her servants said to her, but went off into the jungle, and wandered from jungle to jungle, till she got farther and farther away from her own country."
"All the time she kept saying, ""Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun;"" and so she wandered about for twelve years."
"At the end of the twelve years she met a fakir he was really an angel, but she did not know this who asked her, ""Why do you always say, 'Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun'?"" She answered, ""I am the daughter of the king of the Phalana country, and I want to find Prince Majnun; tell me where his kingdom is."""
"""I think you will never get there,"" said the fakir, ""for it is very far from hence, and you have to cross many rivers to reach it."" But Laili said she did not care; she must see Prince Majnun. ""Well,"" said the fakir, ""when you come to the Bhagirathi river you will see a big fish, a Rohu; and you must get him to carry you to Prince Majnun's country, or you will never reach it."""
"She went on and on, and at last she came to the Bhagirathi river."
"There was a great big fish called the Rohu fish. It was yawning just as she got up to it, and she instantly jumped down its throat into its stomach. All the time she kept saying, ""Majnun, Majnun."" At this the Rohu fish was greatly alarmed and swam down the river as fast as he could. By degrees he got tired and went slower, and a crow came and perched on his back, and said ""Caw, caw."" ""Oh, Mr. Crow,"" said the poor fish ""do see what is in my stomach that makes such a noise."""
"The Rattlesnake, for it was he, raised his head to look at the bird. The young Blue Jay saw that his eyes were very bright. He looked right into them, and could see little pictures of himself upon their shining surfaces. He stood still to look, and the Rattlesnake came nearer. Then the young Blue Jay tried to see his tail, but he couldn't look away from the Rattlesnake's eyes, though he tried ever so hard."
"The Rattlesnake now coiled up his body, flattened out his head, and showed his teeth, while all the time his queer forked tongue ran in and out of his mouth. Then the young Blue Jay tried to move and found that he couldn't. All he could do was to stand there and watch those glowing eyes and listen to the song which the Rattlesnake began to sing:"
"""Through grass and fern,   With many a turn,     My shining body I draw."
"In woodland shade   My home is made,     For this is the Forest Law."
"""Whoever tries   To look in my eyes     Comes near to my poisoned jaw;   And birds o'erbold   I charm and hold,     For this is the Forest Law."""
"The Rattlesnake drew nearer and nearer, and the young Blue Jay was shaking with fright, when there was a rustle of wings, and his father and mother flew down and around the Rattlesnake, screaming loudly to all the other Jays, and making the Snake turn away from the helpless little bird he had been about to strike. It was a long time before the forest was quiet again, and when it was, the Blue Jay family were safely in their nest, and the Rattlesnake had gone home without his supper."
"After the young Blue Jay got over his fright, he began to complain because he had not seen the Rattlesnake's tail. Then, indeed, his patient mother gave him such a scolding as he had never had in all his life, and his father said that he deserved a sound pecking for his foolishness."
"When the young Blue Jay showed that he was sorry for all the trouble that he had made, his parents let him have some supper and go to bed; but not until he had learned two sayings which he was always to remember. And these were the sayings: ""A really brave bird dares to be afraid of some things,"" and, ""If you go near enough to see the tail of a danger, you may be struck by its head."""
THE RED SQUIRRELS BEGIN HOUSEKEEPING
"The first thing that Mr. Red Squirrel did after coming to the forest and meeting the Gray Squirrel was to look for something to eat. It was not a good season for a stranger who had no hidden store of nuts and seeds to draw upon. The apples and corn were not ripe, and last year's seeds and acorns were nearly gone. What few remained here and there had lost their sweet and wholesome taste. Poor Mr. Red Squirrel began to wish that he had eaten breakfast before he ran away. He even went to the edge of the forest and looked over toward the farmhouse, where his open cage hung in the sunshine. He knew that there were nuts and a fresh bit of fruit inside of it, and his mouth watered at the thought of them, but he was a sensible young fellow, and he knew that if he went back to eat, the cage door would be snapped shut, and he would never again be free to scamper in the beautiful trees."
"""I will starve first!"" he said to himself, and he was so much in earnest that he spoke quite loudly."
"The words were hardly out of his mouth when ""Pft!"" a fat acorn came down at his feet. He caught it up with his forepaws before looking around. It was smooth and glossy, not at all as though it had passed a long winter on an oak branch. He took a good nibble at it and then looked up to see if there were more on the tree above him. You can think how surprised he was to find himself sitting beneath a maple, for in all the years since the world began no maple has ever borne acorns."
"""There are no more to come,"" he said. ""I must take small bites and make it last as long as I can."" And he turned it around and around, clutching it tightly with his long, crooked claws, so that not the tiniest bit could be lost. At last it was all eaten, not a crumb was left, and then ""Pft!"" down came a walnut. This hit him squarely on the back, but he was too hungry to mind, and he ate it all, just stopping long enough to say:"
"""If this maple bears such fruit as acorns and walnuts, I should like to live in a maple grove."""
"Next came a hazelnut, then a butternut, and last of all a fat kernel of yellow corn. He knew now that some friend was hidden in the branches above, so he tucked the corn in one of his cheek-pockets, and scampered up the maple trunk to find out who it was. He saw a whisking reddish-brown tail, and knew that some other Red Squirrel was there. But whoever it was did not mean to be caught, and such a chase as he had!"
"Just as he thought he had overtaken his unknown friend, he could see nothing more of her, and he was almost vexed to think how careless he must have been to miss her. He ran up and down the tree on which he last saw her, and found a little hollow in one of its large branches. He looked in, and there she was, the same dainty creature whom he had so often watched from his cage. He could see that she was breathless from running so fast, yet she pretended to be surprised at seeing him."
"Perhaps she now thought that she had been too bold in giving him food, and so wanted him to think that it had been somebody else."
"""Good morning!"" said he. ""Thank you very much for your kindness."""
"""What do you mean?"" said she."
"""As though you didn't know!"" he answered. ""I never heard of a maple tree that bore acorns, nuts, and corn, and that in the springtime."""
"""Oh, well,"" said she, tossing her pretty head, ""you have lived in a cage and may not know what our forest trees can do."""
"That was a rather saucy thing to say, but Mr. Red Squirrel knew her kind heart and that she said it only in mischief. ""How do you know I have lived in a cage?"" he asked."
"""I I thought you looked like the Squirrel at the farmhouse,"" she said; and then forgetting herself, she added, ""You did look so surprised when that walnut hit you."""
"""Where were you then?"" he asked quickly."
"""Oh! I was on a branch above you,"" she answered, seeing that he now knew all about it. ""You looked so hungry, and I had plenty of food stored away. You may have some whenever you wish. It must have been dreadful in that cage."""
"Now Mr. Red Squirrel had loved his little friend ever since the first time he saw her on the rail fence, but he had never thought she would care for him a tired, discouraged fellow, who had passed such a sorrowful life in prison. Yet when he heard her pitying words, and saw the light in her tender eyes, he wondered if he could win her for his wife."
"""I shall never be able to do anything for you,"" said he. ""You are young and beautiful and know the forest ways. I am a stranger and saddened by my hard life. I wish I could help you."""
"""The Blue Jays! The Blue Jays!"" she cried, starting up. ""They have found my hidden acorns and are eating them."""
"And sure enough, a pair of those handsome robbers were pulling acorn after acorn out of a tree-hollow near by, and eating them as fast as they could. You should have seen Mr. Red Squirrel then! He leaped from branch to branch until he reached the Blue Jays; then he stood by the hole where the acorns were stored, and scolded them."
"""Chickaree-chickaree-quilch-quilch-chickaree-chickaree!"" he said; and that in the Red Squirrel language is a very severe scolding. He jumped about with his head down and his tail jerking, while his eyes gleamed like coals of fire. The Blue Jays made a great fuss and called ""Jay!"
"Jay!"" at him, and made fun of him for being a stranger, but they left at last, and Mr. Red Squirrel turned to his friend."
"The next day it rained, and the next, and the next. Mrs. Goldfinch did not dare leave her nest to make calls, lest the cold raindrops should chill and hurt the four tiny birds that lay curled up in their shells."
"At last the weather was warm and sunshiny, and Mrs. Goldfinch and some of her bird neighbors went to call on Mrs. Mourning Dove. They found her just coming from a wheat-field, where she had been to get grain. ""Oh, you poor creature!"" they cried. ""We have heard all about it. Your poor babies! How sorry we are for you!"""
"Mrs. Mourning Dove looked from one to another as though she did not know what to make of it. ""What do you mean?"" she cooed. ""My babies are well and doing finely. Won't you come to see them?"""
"Then it was the turn of the other birds to be surprised. ""Why,"" they chirped, ""we heard that your eggs had fallen through your nest and had broken and killed the tiny Dove babies inside. Is it true?"""
"""Not a word of it,"" answered Mrs. Mourning Dove. ""The nest is all right, and the eggs were not broken until my two little darlings broke them with their sharp beaks."""
"""Here they are,"" she added, fondly. ""Did you ever see such pretty ones?"
"See him open his bill, the dear! And did you ever see such a neck as she has? Mr. Mourning Dove thinks there never were such children."""
"""But do you feel perfectly safe to leave them in that nest?"" asked the Oriole politely. ""My babies are so restless that I should be afraid to trust them in it."""
"""That is what people always say,"" answered Mrs. Mourning Dove, with a happy coo, ""and I fear that I am a rather poor housekeeper, but it runs in our family. Mr. Mourning Dove and I have raised many pairs of children, and they never rolled out, or tumbled through, or blew away, and I do not worry about these. I shall never be thrifty like you good builders, perhaps, but I'm sure you cannot love your little ones any more than I do mine. It was very kind of you to be so sorry for me when you heard I was in trouble. I think I have the best neighbors in the world."""
"When her callers went away, they could not say enough about Mrs."
"Mourning Dove's pleasant ways, and her gentle, well-behaved children."
"""It is too bad she is such a poor nest-maker,"" the Vireo said, ""and I understand now what she meant when she told me that they sometimes used old Robins' nests for their young. She said they flattened them out and added a few twigs, and that they did finely. I thought it very queer in them to do so, but perhaps if I had not been a good builder I should have done the same thing."""
"""Perhaps we all would,"" the others agreed. ""She certainly is a very pleasant bird, and she is bringing up her children well. Mr. Mourning Dove seems to think her perfect. We won't worry any more about her."""
THE YOUNG BLUE JAY WHO WAS NOT BRAVE ENOUGH TO BE AFRAID
Everybody who is acquainted with the Blue Jays knows that they are a very brave family. That is the best thing that you can say about them.
"To be sure, they dress very handsomely, and there is no prettier sight, on a fine winter morning, than a flock of Blue Jays flitting from branch to branch, dining off the acorns on the oak trees, and cocking their crested heads on one side as they look over the country. They are great talkers then, and are always telling each other just what to do; yet none of them ever do what they are told to, so they might just as well stop giving advice."
"The other people of the forest do not like the Blue Jays at all, and if one of them gets into trouble they will not help him out. This always has been so, and it always will be so. If it could be winter all the time, the Blue Jays could be liked well enough, for in cold weather they eat seeds and nuts and do not quarrel so much with others. It is in the summer that they become bad neighbors. Then they live in the thickest part of the woods and raise families of tiny, fuzzy babies in their great coarse nests. It is then, too, that they change their beautiful coats, and while the old feathers are dropping off and the new ones are growing they are not at all pretty. Oh, then is the time to beware of the Blue Jays!"
"They do very little talking during the summer, and the forest people do not know when they are coming, unless they see a flutter of blue wings among the branches. The Blue Jays have a reason for keeping still then."
"They are doing sly things, and they do not want to be found out."
The wee babies grow fast and their mouths are always open for more food.
"Father and Mother Blue Jay spend all their time in marketing, and they are not content with seeds and berries. They visit the nests of their bird neighbors, and then something very sad happens. When the Blue Jays go to a nest there may be four eggs in it; but when they go away there will not be any left, nothing but pieces of broken egg-shell. It is very, very sad, but this is another of the things which will always be so, and all that the other birds can do is to watch and drive the Jays away."
"There was once a young Blue Jay in the forest who was larger than his brothers and sisters, and kept crowding them toward the edge of the nest. When their father came with a bit of food for them, he would stretch his legs and flutter his wings and reach up for the first bite."
"And because he was the largest and the strongest, he usually got it."
"Sometimes, too, the first bite was so big that there was nothing left for anyone else to bite at. He was a very greedy fellow, and he had no right to take more than his share, just because he happened to be the first of the family to break open the shell, or because he grew fast."
"This same young Blue Jay used to brag about what he would do when he got out of the nest, and his mother told him that he would get into trouble if he were not careful. She said that even Blue Jays had to look out for danger."
"""Huh!"" said the young Blue Jay; ""who's afraid?"""
"""Now you talk like a bully,"" said Mother Blue Jay, ""for people who are really brave are always willing to be careful."""
"But the young Blue Jay only crowded his brothers and sisters more than usual, and thought, inside his foolish little pin-feathery head, that when he got a chance, he'd show them what courage was."
"After a while his chance came. All the small birds had learned to flutter from branch to branch, and to hop quite briskly over the ground."
"One afternoon they went to a part of the forest where the ground was damp and all was strange. The father and mother told their children to keep close together and they would take care of them; but the foolish young Blue Jay wanted a chance to go alone, so he hid behind a tree until the others were far ahead, and then he started off another way. It was great fun for a time, and when the feathered folk looked down at him he raised his crest higher than ever and thought how he would scare them when he was a little older."
"The young Blue Jay was just thinking about this when he saw something long and shining lying in the pathway ahead. He remembered what his father had said about snakes, and about one kind that wore rattles on their tails. He wondered if this one had a rattle, and he made up his mind to see how it was fastened on. ""I am a Blue Jay,"" he said to himself, ""and I was never yet afraid of anything."""
"But the king would not listen. ""Take them away and cut off their heads,"""
he cried angrily. And when his nobles begged him to spare such brave enemies he would not listen to them.
"Then Queen Philippa, whose heart was filled with pity for the poor men, fell upon her knees."
"""My lord,"" she cried, ""if you love me, give me the lives of these men."""
"King Edward could not bear to see his beautiful queen in tears upon the ground, so he raised her, saying: ""Lady, I wish you had not been here, for I cannot say you nay. Take the men, they are yours."""
"Then Queen Philippa joyfully led the brave men away, and gave them food and clothes, and sent them back to their friends. So they, and all the people of Calais, were saved."
Wat Tyler
"In our days, all people in our land, except prisoners, are free to go where they will, and to do what work they please. In olden times it was not so. Then, the poorer people were treated like slaves by the nobles; they had to work hard for their masters, and they were not allowed to move from one place to another without asking leave."
"This was hard, and it made the people very angry. In the days of the boy-king Richard II, a great many workmen made up their minds to obey the nobles no longer. They banded themselves together in a large army, chose a man named Wat Tyler for their leader, and marched to London."
"The Mayor of London tried to stop them, by pulling up the drawbridge which crossed the river Thames, but they forced him by threats to let it down again. Then they rushed through the streets of London, frightening all the people they met by their wild looks and cries. They broke open the prisons, and set the prisoners free, and burned the palaces of the nobles, but they killed no man and robbed none."
"The nobles were much alarmed. With young King Richard at their head, they rode out to meet this army, and to ask the people what they wanted."
"""We want to be free, and we want our children to be free after us,"" said Wat Tyler."
"""I promise you that you shall have your wish, if you will return quietly to your homes,"" said the king."
"At this, the people shouted with joy, and all might have been well; but the mayor, seeing Wat Tyler raise his hand, and fearing that he was going to strike the king, drew his sword, and killed the leader of the people."
"Then the joyful shouts changed to cries and growls of anger. Arms were raised, and the crowd began to press forward. In a minute the little band of nobles would have been attacked, but the boy-king saw the danger. Boldly riding to meet the angry people, he put himself at their head. ""What need ye, my masters?"" cried he. ""I am your captain and your king. Follow me."""
"The crowd stopped, surprised by this bold act; the loud cries ceased, and swords and staves were lowered. These rough men did not wish to harm their young sovereign, but to free him from the nobles who gave him evil counsel. They were greatly pleased to find him upon their side, and, with perfect trust and loyalty, they followed where he led; and so for a time the danger was past."
Bruce and the Spider
"Robert Bruce, King of Scotland, sad and weary, lay upon the floor of a lonely cave among the hills. His mind was full of anxious thoughts, for he was hiding from the English soldiers, who sought to take him alive or dead to their king. The brave Scots had lost many battles, and Bruce began to fear that he would never make his dear country free."
"""I will give up trying,"" said he."
"Just then a spider, hanging from the roof of the cave, by a long thread, swung before the king's eyes, and he left his gloomy thoughts to see what the little creature would do."
"The spider began to climb its thread slowly, pulling itself up little by little; but it had gone only a short way, when it slipped and fell to the end once more."
"Again and again it started to climb, and again and again it slipped back, until it had fallen six times."
"""Surely the silly little creature will now give up trying to climb so fine a thread,"" thought Bruce. But the spider did no such thing. It started on its upward journey yet a seventh time, and this time it did not fall. Up it went, inch by inch, higher and higher, until at last it reached the roof, and was safely at home."
"""Bravo!"" cried the king. ""The spider has taught me a lesson. I too will try until I win."""
"Bruce kept his word. He led his brave men to battle, again and again, until at last the English were driven back to their own land, and Scotland was free."
Richard and Blondel
"""No,"" answered the Queen-Mother, ""I don't. You see, I have so much to think about, and happy thoughts make tasks light. And then, you know, it is not always the same kind of egg, and that makes a pleasant change for me. I will give you a motto to remember: 'As long as a Bee is well, work is pleasant when done faithfully.'"""
"""Perhaps that is the matter with me,"" said the Worker, raising her drooping head. ""I have been careless lately when I thought nobody was looking. I will try your way."""
"When she had gone, the Queen-Mother smiled to herself and said: ""Poor child! When work is no longer a pleasure, life is indeed sad. But any Larva should know better than to work carelessly when she is not watched."""
THE HAUGHTY GROUND HOG
"Not far from the home of the Rabbits was another burrow where the Ground Hog lived, and there was a very kindly feeling between the neighbors."
"They liked the same food, and as there was plenty for all, they often nibbled together near the edge of the forest. The little Rabbits were fond of him and liked to listen to his stories. Once the biggest little Rabbit had run into the Ground Hog's burrow by mistake when he was frightened, and that was the beginning of a great friendship between them."
"They were a queer-looking couple, for the Rabbit was small and quick and dainty, while the Ground Hog, with his stout body covered with thick, reddish fur, his broad, flat head, and his short legs, was a clumsy fellow. To be sure, he could get out of sight quickly if he had to, but he never scampered around and kicked up his heels for the fun of it, as the Rabbits did. He was too dignified to do that. He came of an old family and he could remember who his grandfather was. There were but few people in the forest who could do that; so, of course, he could not frisk like his neighbors."
"Perhaps if the Ground Hog had not belonged to so old a family, he might have had a better time. Yet the thought that he could remember his grandfather was a great pleasure to him, and when he was talking he would often remark in the most careless way, ""as my grandfather used to say""; or, ""That reminds me of something my grandfather once did."" Some people said that he did this to show off; but it may be that they were envious."
"However that may have been, the Ground Hog was certainly a haughty fellow, and if he had not been so gentle and kind a neighbor people would not have liked him. Only once had he been known to get angry, and that was when a saucy young Chipmunk had spoken of him as a Woodchuck."
"""Woodchuck! Woodchuck!"" he had grunted. ""You young Bushy-tail, I am a Ground Hog, and the Ground Hog family lived in this forest long before you ever opened your eyes. People with good manners do not call us 'Woodchucks.' We do not like the name. My grandfather could not endure it."""
"It was not very long after this that he told the wondering young Rabbits about his grandfather. When talking, the Ground Hog rested by the edge of his burrow, sitting on his haunches, and waving his queer little forepaws whenever he told anything especially important. And this was the story:"
"""Perhaps you may have heard me speak of my grandfather. Ah, he was a Ground Hog worth seeing! He was large, and, although when I knew him the black fur on his back was streaked with gray, he was still handsome. He was clever, too. I have often heard my father say that he could dig the deepest and best burrow in the forest. And then he had such fine manners! There was not another Ground Hog in the country around who could eat as noisily as he, and it is said that when he was courting my grandmother she chose him because of the elegant way in which he sat up on his haunches. I have been told, children, that I am very much like him."""
"Just here, a Red-headed Woodpecker gave a loud ""Rat-a-tat-tat"" on the tree above the Ground Hog's head, and there was a look around her bill as though she wanted to laugh. The Ground Hog slowly turned his head to look at her as she flew away. ""Quite a good-looking young person,"" he said, ""but badly brought up. She should know better than to disturb those who are talking. What was I saying, children?"""
"""You were telling how well your grandfather sat up on his haunches,"""
said the smallest little Rabbit.
"""So I was! So I was! I must tell you how my grandfather came to know the world so well. When he was only a young fellow, he made his home for a time by a Hen house, and so heard the talk of the barn-yard people."
"Once he heard them tell how the farmer watched on a certain winter day to see my grandfather come out of his burrow. Of course, you children all know how we Ground Hogs do; in the fall we are very fat, and when the cold weather comes we go to sleep in our burrows to wait for spring."
"Sometimes we awaken and stretch, but we go to sleep again very soon."
"Then, when spring comes we are slender and have healthy appetites."
"""The Hens treated my grandfather with great politeness, and the Black Brahma Cock showed plainly how honored they felt to have him there. They said that they were so glad my grandfather stayed out of his burrow awhile on this winter day when the farmer was watching, because they were in a hurry for warm weather. My grandfather did not know what they meant by that, but he was too wise to say so, and he found out by asking questions, that if a Ground Hog leaves his burrow on this certain day in winter, and sees his shadow, and goes back again, it will be cold for a long time after that. If he does not see his shadow, and stays out, it will soon be warm."
"""You see now, children, how important our family is; and yet we are so modest that we had not even known that we made the weather until the Hens told my grandfather. But that is the way! Really great people often think the least of themselves."""
"""And do you make the weather?"" asked the smallest little Rabbit."
"""I suppose we do,"" said the Ground Hog, with a smile. ""It is a great care. I often say to myself: 'Shall I have it warm, or shall I have it cold?' It worries me so that sometimes I can hardly eat."""
"""And how do you know when the day comes for you to make the weather?"""
said the smallest little rabbit.
"""Ahem! Well-er! I am sorry to say that my grandfather did not find out exactly what day it is that they watch for us, so I have to guess at that. But to think that we Ground Hogs make the weather for all the other people! It is worth a great deal to belong to such a family. I suppose I might have been a Weasel, a Fox, an Owl, or an Oriole. And it is a great thing to have known one's grandfather."""
"The little Rabbits sat very still, wishing that they had known their grandfather, when suddenly the biggest one said: ""If you should stay out of your burrow when that day comes, and another Ground Hog should go back into his burrow, how would the weather know what to do?"""
"""Children,"" said the old Ground Hog, ""I think your mother is calling to you. You might better go to see. Good-by."" And he waved his paw politely."
"The seven little Rabbits scampered away, but their mother was not calling them. She wasn't even there, and when they went back they couldn't find the Ground Hog. They wondered how he happened to make such a mistake. The Red-headed Woodpecker who came along at about that time, twisted her head on one side and said: ""Made-a-mistake! Rat-a-tat-tat!"
"Not he!"""
"What tangles they did get into! Each little Rabbit had four legs, two short ones in front, and two long ones behind to help him take long jumps from one place to another. So, you see, there were twenty-eight legs there, pushing, catching in the hay, kicking, and sometimes just waving in the air when their tiny owners chanced to roll over on their backs and couldn't get right side up again. Then Mamma Rabbit would come and poke them this way and that, never hurting any of them, but getting the nest in order."
"""It is a great deal of work to pick up after children,"" she would say with a tired little sigh, ""but it will not be long before they have homes of their own and are doing the same thing."""
"Mamma Rabbit was quite right when she said that, for all of their people set up housekeeping when very young, and then the cares of life begin."
"One fine morning when the children were alone in their burrow, the biggest little Rabbit had a queer feeling in his face, below and in front of his long ears, and above his eager little nose. It almost scared him at first, for he had never before felt anything at all like it. Then he guessed what it meant. There were two bunchy places on his face, that Mamma Rabbit had told him were eyes. ""When you are older,"""
"she had said to him, ""these eyes will open, and then you will see."" For the Rabbit children are always blind when they are babies."
"When his mother told him that, the biggest little Rabbit had said, ""What do you mean when you say I shall 'see'? Is it anything like eating?"""
"And Mamma Rabbit said, ""No, you cannot taste things until you touch them, but you can see them when they are far away."""
"""Then it is like smelling,"" said the biggest little Rabbit."
"""No, it is not like smelling, either, for there are many things, like stones, which one cannot smell and yet can see."""
"""Then it surely is like hearing,"" said the biggest little Rabbit."
"""Oh dear!"" exclaimed his mother, who was tired of having questions asked which could not be answered. ""It is not a bit like hearing. You could never hear a black cloud coming across the sky, but you could see it if you were outside your burrow. Nobody can make you understand what seeing is until your eyes are open, and then you will find out for yourself without asking."""
"This made the biggest little Rabbit lie still for a while, and then he said: ""What is a black cloud, and why does it come across the sky? And what is the sky, and why does it let the cloud come? And what is "" But he did not get any answer, for his mother ran out of the burrow as fast as she could."
"And now his eyes were surely opening and he should see! His tiny heart thumped hard with excitement, and he rubbed his face with his forepaws to make his eyes open faster. Ah! There it was; something round and bright at the other end of the burrow, and some queer, slender things were waving across it. He wondered if it were good to eat, but he dared not crawl toward it to see. He did not know that the round, bright thing was just a bit of sky which he saw through the end of the burrow, and that the slender, waving ones were the branches of a dead tree tossing in the wind. Then he looked at his brothers and sisters as they lay beside him. He would not have known what they were if he had not felt of them at the same time."
"""I can see!"" he cried. ""I can see everything that there is to see! I'm ahead of you! Don't you wish that you could see, too?"""
"That was not a very kind thing to say, but in a minute more his brothers and sisters had reason to be glad that they couldn't see. Even while he was speaking and looking toward the light, he saw a brown head with two round eyes look in at him, and then a great creature that he thought must surely be a dog ran in toward him. How frightened he was then! He pushed his nose in among his blind brothers and sisters and tried to hide himself among them. He thought something dreadful was about to happen."
"""I wish Mamma Rabbit would come,"" he squeaked, shutting his eyes as closely as he could. ""I wish Mamma Rabbit would come."""
"""Why, here I am,"" she answered. ""What are you afraid of?"""
"The biggest little Rabbit opened his eyes, and there was the creature who had frightened him so, and it was his own mother! You can imagine how glad she was to see that one of her children had his eyes open."
"""I will call in some of my Rabbit friends,"" she said, ""and let you see them, if you will promise not to be afraid."""
"The next day four of the other little Rabbits had their eyes open, and the day after that they all could see each other and the shining piece of sky at the end of the burrow. It was not so very long afterward that the Rabbit family went out to dine in the forest, and this was the first time that the children had seen their father. Often when their mother left them alone in the burrow she had pulled grass and leaves over the opening to hide it from him, for Rabbit fathers do not love their children until they are old enough to go out into the great world, and it would never do for them to know where their babies are kept. Then their father taught them how to gnaw tough bark to wear their teeth down, for Rabbits' teeth grow all the time, and if they were to eat only soft food, their teeth would get too long. He taught them, too, how to move their ears in the right way for keen hearing, and told them that when chased they must run for the burrow or the nearest thicket. ""Then crouch down on some leaves that are the color of your fur,"" he said, ""and you may not be seen at all."""
"""Why should we run?"" said the biggest little Rabbit."
"""Because you might be caught if you didn't."""
"""What might catch us?"" asked the biggest little Rabbit."
"""Oh, a Hawk, perhaps, or a Weasel."""
"""What does a Hawk look like?"""
"""Like a great bird floating in the sky,"" said Papa Rabbit. ""Now, don't ask me a single question more."""
"""Does a Hawk look like that bird above us?"" asked the biggest little Rabbit."
"His father gave one look upward. ""Yes!"" he said. ""Run!"""
"And just as the Hawk swooped down toward the ground, he saw nine white-tipped tails disappear into a burrow near by."
THE LITTLE BAT WHO WOULDN'T GO TO BED
"""Come,"" said Mamma Bat, flying toward her home in the cave, ""it is time that you children went to bed. The eastern sky is growing bright, and I can see the fleecy clouds blush rosy red as the sun looks at them."""
"When Mr. Red Squirrel first came to the forest, he knew nothing of the way in which they do, and he afterward said that learning forest manners was even harder than running away from his old home. You see, Mr. Red Squirrel was born in the forest, but was carried away from there when he was only a baby. From that time until he was grown, he had never set claw upon a tree, and all he could see of the world he had seen by peeping through the bars of a cage. His cousins in the forest learned to frisk along the fence-tops and to jump from one swaying branch to another, but when this poor little fellow longed for a scamper he could only run around and around in a wire wheel that hummed as it turned, and this made him very dizzy."
"He used to wonder if there were nothing better in life, for he had been taken from his woodland home when he was too young to remember about it."
"One day he saw another Squirrel outside, a dainty little one who looked as though she had never a sad thought. That made him care more than ever to be free, and when he curled down in his cotton nest that night he dreamed about her, and that they were eating acorns together in a tall oak tree."
"The next day Mr. Red Squirrel pretended to be sick. He would not run in the wheel or taste the food in his cage. When his master came to look at him, he moaned pitifully and would not move one leg. His master thought that the leg was broken, and took limp little Mr. Red Squirrel in his hand to the window to see what was the matter. The window was up, and when he saw his chance, Mr. Red Squirrel leaped into the open air and was away to the forest. His poor legs were weak from living in such a small cage, but how he ran! His heart thumped wildly under the soft fur of his chest, and his breath came in quick gasps, and still he ran, leaping, scrambling, and sometimes falling, but always nearer the great green trees of his birthplace."
"At last he was safe and sat trembling on the lowest branch of a beech-tree. The forest was a new world to him and he asked many questions of a fat, old Gray Squirrel. The Gray Squirrel was one of those people who know a great deal and think that they know a great, great deal, and want others to think so too. He was so very knowing and important that, although he answered all of Mr. Red Squirrel's questions, he really did not tell him any of the things which he most wanted to know, and this is the way in which they talked:"
"""What is the name of this place?"" asked Mr. Red Squirrel."
"""This? Why this is the forest, of course,"" answered the Gray Squirrel."
"""We have no other name for it. It is possible that there are other forests in the world, but they cannot be so fine as this, so we call ours 'the forest.'"""
"""Are there pleasant neighbors here?"" asked Mr. Red Squirrel."
"""Very good, very good. My wife and I do not call on many of them, but still they are good enough people, I think."""
"""Then why don't you call?"""
"""Why? Why? Because they are not in our set. It would never do."" And the Gray Squirrel sat up very straight indeed."
"""Who is that gliding fellow on the ground below?"" asked the newcomer."
"""Is he one of your friends?"""
"""That? That is the Rattlesnake. We never speak to each other. There has always been trouble between our families."""
"""Who lives in that hollow tree yonder?"""
"""Sh, sh! That is where the Great Horned Owl has his home. He is asleep now and must not be awakened, for Squirrels and Owls cannot be friendly."""
"""Why not?"""
"""Because. It has always been so."""
"""And who is that bird just laying an egg in her nest above us?"""
"""Speak softly, please. That is the Cowbird, and it is not her nest. You will get into trouble if you talk such things aloud. She can't help it."
"She has to lay her eggs in other birds' nests, but they don't like it."""
"Mr. Red Squirrel tried very hard to find out the reason for this, but there are always some things for which no reason can be given; and there are many questions which can never be answered, even if one were to ask, ""Why? why? why?"" all day long. So Mr. Red Squirrel, being a wise little fellow, stopped asking, and thought by using his eyes and ears he would in time learn all that he needed to know. He had good eyes and keen ears, and he learned very fast without making many mistakes. He had a very happy life among the forest people, and perhaps that was one reason. He learned not to say things which made his friends feel badly, and he did not ask needless questions. And after all, you know, it would have been very foolish to ask questions which nobody could answer, and worse than foolish to ask about matters which he could find out for himself."
"It is in the forest as in the world outside. We can know that many things are, but we never know why they are."
WHY MR GREAT HORNED OWL HATCHED THE EGGS
"If the Rattlesnake is the king of the forest in the daytime, the Great Horned Owl is the king at night. Indeed, he is much the more powerful of the two, for he is king of air and earth alike and can go wherever he wishes, while the snake can only rule over those who live near the ground or who are so careless as to come to him there."
"There was but one pair of Great Horned Owls in the forest, and they lived in the deepest shade, having their great clumsy nest in the hollow of a tall tree. You might have walked past it a hundred times and never have guessed that any Owls lived there, if you did not notice the round pellets of bone and hair on the grass. They are such hungry fellows that they swallow their food with the bones in it. Then their tough little stomachs go to work, rolling all the pieces of bone and hair into balls and sending them back to be cast out of the Owls' mouths to the ground."
"The Great Horned Owl was a very large bird. His whole body was covered with brown, dull yellow, and white feathers. Even his feet and legs were covered, and all that you could see besides were his black claws and his black hooked bill. Yes, at night you could see his eyes, too, and they were wonderful great eyes that could see in the dark, but they were shut in the daytime when he was resting. His wife, who was the queen of the forest at night, looked exactly like him, only she was larger than he. And that is the way among Owls, the wife is always larger than her husband."
"Every night when the sun had gone down, the Great Horned Owl and his wife would come out of their hollow tree and sit blinking on a branch near by, waiting until it got dark enough for them to see quite plainly."
"As the light faded, the little black spots in their eyes would grow bigger and bigger, and then off they would go on their great soft, noiseless wings, hunting in the grass and among the branches for the supper which they called breakfast."
"Mrs. Owl could not be gone very long at a time, for there were two large round white eggs in the nest which must not get cold. Her husband was on the wing most of the night, and he often flew home with some tender morsel for her. He was really a kind-hearted fellow, although you could never have made the small birds think so. Sometimes his wife would sigh and tell how tired she was of sitting still, and how glad she would be when the eggs were hatched and she could go more with him. When she began to speak of that, the Great Horned Owl would get ready for another flight and go off saying: ""It is too bad. I am so sorry for you. But then, one would never have young Owlets if one didn't stick to the nest."" He was always proud of his children, and he thought himself a very good husband. Perhaps he was; still he had never taken his place on the nest while his wife went hunting."
"He had a good mind to try it. There was nobody to watch him, and he crept up the trunk of a fallen tree which leaned over against its neighbors. It was a foolish thing to do, and he knew it, but young Rabbits are too full of mischief to always be wise."
"""I will hold my hind legs very still,"" he thought, ""and flap my forelegs for wings."" With that he jumped off and came crashing down upon the dry leaves. He felt weak and dizzy, and as he picked himself up and looked around he hoped that nobody had seen him. ""It may be a great deal of fun to fly,"" he said, ""but it is no fun alighting from your flight unless you have real feather wings. It is too bumpy when you fly with your legs."""
"At this minute he heard an old Gobbler call out, and saw the flock of Turkeys coming toward him. ""Wake up! Wake up!"" he cried to the Ground Hog. But the Ground Hog never moved."
"Still the Turkeys came nearer. The Rabbit could see that the fat old ones were getting ahead of the others, and that here and there a young or weak Turkey had to drop into the river and swim, because his wings were tired. They got so near that he could see the queer little tufts of wiry feathers which the Gobblers wear hanging from their breast, and could see the swaying scarlet wattles under their beaks. He called again to the Ground Hog, and getting no answer, poked him three times with his head."
"The Ground Hog turned over, stretched, yawned, moved his jaws a few times as though he dreamed of eating fresh spring grass, and then fell asleep once more. After that the Rabbit left him alone."
"The first to alight were the Gobblers, and they began at once to strut and chatter. Next came the mother Turkeys and their young, and last of all came the weak ones who swam across. It was a fine sight to see them come in. The swimmers spread their tails, folded their wings tightly, stretched their necks, and struck out swiftly and strongly with their feet."
"The young Rabbit could hear a group of mothers talking together. ""The Gobblers are growing quite fond of the children,"" said one."
"""Yes,"" said another; ""my husband told me yesterday that he was very proud of our little ones."""
"""Well, it is the season for them to begin to walk together,"" said the first speaker; ""but I never in my life had such a time as I had this spring. I thought my husband would break every egg I laid."""
"""I had a hard time too,"" said the other. ""None of my eggs were broken, but after my chicks were hatched I had to hurry them out of their father's sight a dozen times a day."""
"""It is very trying,"" said a third mother Turkey with a sigh; ""but that is always the way with the Gobblers. I suppose the dear fellows can't help it;"" and she looked lovingly over at her husband as he strutted around with his friends. You would not have believed if you had seen her fond looks, and heard her husband's tender ""Gobble,"" that they had hardly spoken to each other all summer. To be sure, it was not now as it had been in the springtime. Then he would have beaten any other Gobbler who came near her, he loved her so; still, the Rabbit could see as he watched them that when he found some very large and fine acorns, this Gobbler would not eat them all, but called his wife to come and share with him; and he knew that they were happy together in their own Turkey way of being happy."
At this minute the Ground Hog opened his eyes and staggered to his feet.
"The loud talking had awakened him. He did not look very dignified just now. His fur was rumpled, and he blinked often from sleepiness. There was a dry leaf caught on one of his ears, too, that made him look very odd. The Rabbit wanted to laugh, but he did not dare to do so. The Ground Hog walked toward the Gobblers, and raised himself on his haunches."
"""Good-evening, good-evening,"" said he (it was really morning, you know). ""We are very glad to welcome you to the forest. Make yourselves perfectly at home. The grass is not so tender as it was a while ago, yet I think that you will find good feeding,"" and he waved his paws politely."
"""Thank-you, thank-you!"" answered the Gobblers, while the mothers and young Turkeys came crowding up to look at the Ground Hog. ""We came for the acorns and nuts. We shall certainly enjoy ourselves."""
"""That is right,"" said the Ground Hog heartily. ""We have a very fine forest here. You will pardon me for remarking it. The Pond People have a saying that is very true: 'It's a mighty poor Frog that won't croak for his own puddle.' And my grandfather used to say that if a Ground Hog didn't love his own home he was a very poor Hog indeed. Good-night, my friends, good-night."" And he trotted happily away, followed by the Rabbit."
"When he was gone, the Turkeys said: ""How very kind of him!"" and ""What fine manners!"" And the young Rabbit thought to himself: ""It is queer. He was sleepy and his fur was rumpled, and that leaf bobbed around his ear when he talked. He said 'evening' instead of 'morning,' and spoke as though Turkeys came here to eat grass. And yet they all liked him, and were pleased by what he said."""
You see the young Rabbit had not yet learned that the power of fine manners is more than that of looks; and that people could not think of the Ground Hog's mistakes in speaking because they knew his kindness of heart.
THE TRAVELLERS GO SOUTH
"One night a maple tree, the very one under which Mr. Red Squirrel sat when he first came to the forest, dreamed of her winter resting-time, and when she awakened early in the morning she found that her leaves were turning yellow. They were not all brightly colored, but on each was an edging, or a tip, or a splash of gold. You may be sure that the Forest People noticed it at once."
"""I told you so,"" chirruped a Robin to her mate. ""The Orioles went long ago, and the Bobolinks start to-day. We must think about our trip to the South."" When she said this, she hopped restlessly from twig to twig with an air of being exceedingly busy."
"Her husband did not answer, but began to arrange his new coat of feathers. Perhaps he was used to her fussy ways and thought it just as well to keep still. He knew that none of the Robins would start South until the weather became much colder, and he did not think it necessary to talk about it yet. Perhaps, too, Mr. Robin was a trifle contrary and was all the more slow and quiet because his wife was uneasy. In that case one could hardly blame her for talking over the family plans with the neighbors."
"Later in the day, a Bobolink came up from the marsh to say good-by. He had on his travelling suit of striped brown, and you would never have known him for the same gay fellow who during the spring and early summer wore black and buff and sang so heartily and sweetly. Now he did not sing at all, and slipped silently from bush to bush, only speaking when he had to. He was a good fellow and everyone disliked to have him go."
"Mrs. Cowbird came up while they were talking. Now that she did not care to lay any more eggs, the other birds were quite friendly with her. They began to talk over the summer that was past, and said how finely the young birds were coming on. ""By the way,"" said she, in the most careless manner possible, ""I ought to have a few children round here somewhere."
"Can anybody tell me where they are?"""
"Mrs. Goldfinch looked at her husband and he looked at the sky. The Warblers and the Vireos, who had known about the strange egg in the Goldfinches' nest, had already left for the winter, and there seemed to be no use in telling their secret now or quarrelling over what was past."
"Some of the other birds might have told Mrs. Cowbird a few things, but they also kept still."
"""It is a shame,"" she said. ""I never laid a finer lot of eggs in my life, and I was very careful where I put them. I wish I knew how many there were, but I forgot to count. I have been watching and watching for my little birds to join our flock; I was sure I should know them if I saw them. Mothers have such fine feelings, you know, in regard to their children."" (As though she had any right to say that!)"
"The Mourning Doves were there with their young son and daughter, and you could see by looking at them that they were an affectionate family. ""We shall be the last to go South,"" they cooed. ""We always mean to come North in the very early spring and stay as late as possible. This year we came much later than usual, but it could not be helped."" They had spoken so before, and rather sadly. It was said that they could tell a sorrowful story if they would; but they did not wish to sadden others by it, and bore their troubles together bravely and lovingly."
"""How do the new feathers work?"" asked a Crow, flying up at this minute and looking blacker than ever in his fall coat. Then all the birds began to talk about dress. As soon as their broods were raised, you know, their feathers had begun to drop out, and they had kept on moulting until all of the old ones were gone and the new ones on. When birds are moulting they never feel well, and when it is over they are both happy and proud."
"""I changed later than usual this year,"" said the Crow, ""and I feel that I have the very latest fashions."" This was a joke which he must have picked up among the Barnyard People, and nobody knows where they got it. Fashions never change in the Forest."

“Why?” asked the old man.
There was a titter....
"Ffolliott, thinking he saw someone he knew, went up to Lovegood and"
slapped the big man on the back:
"“Hullo, old chap!” cried he."
Blank consternation came upon him as Lovegood slowly turned and
"solemnly faced him. The weak-knee’d, foolish Ffolliott faltered"
nervously:
"“Oh, er--er--I thought you were someone else,” he drawled."
Lovegood nodded gloomily.
"“I am,” he said sepulchrally."
Ffolliott tittered confusedly:
"“Ye-yes--indeed,” he said, twisting his fingers and fidgeting. “D’you"
"know, I feel such an awful ass----”"
Lovegood coughed:
“But that is no excuse for your being in the other ass’s skin!” he
growled.

fancy-dress affair....”

AT FONTAINEBLEAU.
"IT was a day of sun and rain,"
Uncertain as a child’s quick moods;
And I shall never pass again
So blithe a day among the woods.
"The forest knew you and was glad,"
And laughed for very joy to know
"Her child was with her; then, grown sad,"
"She wept, because her child must go."
And you would spy and you would capture
The shyest flower that lit the grass:
The joy I had to watch your rapture
Was keen as even your rapture was.
"The forest knew you and was glad,"
And laughed and wept for joy and woe.
This was the welcome that you had
Among the woods of Fontainebleau.
ON THE HEATH.
HER face’s wilful flash and glow
Turned all its light upon my face
night
As a stone that falls in a sounding well;
"Under us the Seine flows through dark and light,"
While the beat of time—hark!—is audible.
"Lights on bank and bridge glitter gold and red,"
Lights upon the stream glitter red and white;
"Under us the night, and the night overhead."
"We together, we alone together in the night."
“I DREAM OF HER.”
"I DREAM of her the whole night long,"
The pillows with my tears are wet.
"I wake, I seek amid the throng"
The courage to forget.
"Yet still, as night comes round, I dread,"
"With unavailing fears,"
"The dawn that finds, beneath my head,"
The pillows wet with tears.
TEARS.
"When you were here, I sometimes tired,"
"Ah me! that you so loved me, dear."
"Now, in these weary days desired,"
You are no longer here.
"When you were here, did either know"
"That each so loved the other, dear?"
But that was long and long ago:
You are no longer here.
APRIL MIDNIGHT.
"SIDE by side through the streets at midnight,"
"Roaming together,"
"Through the tumultuous night of London,"
In the miraculous April weather.
"Roaming together under the gaslight,"
"Day’s work over,"
"How the Spring calls to us, here in the city,"
Calls to the heart from the heart of a lover!
"Cool the wind blows, fresh in our faces,"
"Cleansing, entrancing,"
"After the heat and the fumes and the footlights,"
Where you dance and I watch your dancing.
"Good it is to be here together,"
"""Good Lord!"" moaned the Superintendent, ""and what's your salary?"""
The sergeant's good-humour was impregnable.
"""Give me time,"" he said, and the sentence was almost drowned in a loud"
knock at the door. An instant later Kilshaw rushed in.
"""What's this, Dawson?"" he cried to the Superintendent; ""what's this"
"about the murder?"""
"""You haven't heard, sir?"""
"""I went out of town to avoid this infernal row to-day, and am only just"
"back."""
Dawson smiled discreetly. He could understand that the proceedings of
the day would not attract Mr. Kilshaw.
"""But is it true,"" Kilshaw went on eagerly, ""that Mr. Benham has been"
"murdered?"""
"""Well, it looks like it, sir,"" and Dawson gave a full account of the"
circumstances.
"""And the motive?"" asked Kilshaw."
"""Robbery, I suppose. His pockets were empty, and according to our"
"information he was generally flush of money; where he got it, I don't"
"know."""
"""Ah!"" said Kilshaw meditatively; ""his pockets empty! And have you no"
The spectral custodian had refilled the tankards with amber liquid.
Thereof the Abbot sipped understandingly.
"""Lacrymae Christi,"" he turned to the duke. ""Vestrae salubritati bibo!"""
The duke raised his goblet.
"""Waes Hael!"" and he drained its contents with a huge gulp."
"""I would chant twenty psalms for that beverage,"" he mused after a"
while.
"The Abbot suggested ""Attendite Populi!""--""It is one of the longest,"""
"he said, with meaning."
"""Don't trifle with a thirsty belly,"" growled the duke. ""In these"
"troublous times it behooves men to be circumspect!"""
"""Probatum est,"" said the Abbot. ""It is a noble vocation! Jubilate"
"Deo!"""
And he raised his goblet.
The Duke of Spoleto laid a heavy hand upon his arm.
"""It is a Vigil of the Church!"""
The Abbot gave himself absolution on account of the great company.
"""There's no fast on the drink!"" he said with meaning. ""Nor is there"
"better wine between here and Salamanca!"""
Something in his tones brought to his hostess one of those swift fits of
repentance that were apt to wait for her whenever she allowed herself to
treat this visitor with friendliness. He was so very prompt in
responding!
"""She is not very well,"" she answered, rather coldly."
"""I--I hope I shall have the pleasure of seeing her?"""
Mr. Coxon's wishes were fulfilled to the moment. The door opened and
Alicia came in. On seeing him she stopped.
"""Come in, Alicia,"" said Lady Eynesford. ""Here's Mr. Coxon come to be"
"congratulated."""
Coxon stood up with a propitiatory smile.
"""How do you do, Mr. Coxon?"" said Alicia, giving him a limp hand. ""Shall"
"I ring for tea, Mary?"""
"""They'll bring it. You haven't wished him joy."""
"""Oh, are you in the new Ministry?"""
"""I have that honour, Miss Derosne. I hope you are on our side?"""
"""I don't quite know which side you are on--now,"" observed Alicia, in"
slow but distinct tones.
Coxon grew red.
energy enough to create more than the delicate measure of a gust of
chamber-music.
A burst of applause followed the recital of a poem.
Noll roused with a start:
"“Come, Madelaine,” said he--“this heavy air is making you faint. Come"
with me and we’ll have some supper.”
She gathered her skirts with wonted grace of gesture and took his arm;
and they made their way out of the room almost unnoticed.
"As the doors closed on them, she turned in the dim ill-lit passage,"
"drew down his face to her between her two hands, and kissed him."
She clung to him:
"“Thou must give me a bed too,” she whispered hoarsely; “I have no bed.”"
She was trembling.
"“You are tired, Madelaine,” he said."
She nodded:
“I have had no sleep for three nights.”
“What have you been doing?” he asked.
"“I walked about the streets,” she answered simply."
“Well?”
“Does it not seem odd to you?”
"“Not at all. A relation of her first husband’s, I suppose. In fact"
Yvonne said as much.”
"“I could not help being struck by the name, Everard. It is so peculiar."
I remembered it from the publication of the banns.”
"“I compliment you on your memory, Emmeline,” said the Canon."
"Mrs. Winstanley drew herself up, offended."
"She walked from the window where they were standing to a table, and"
fetched from it a newspaper.
“Do you remember the Christian name of Yvonne’s first husband?”
"The Canon drew himself up too, and frowned."
"“What is the meaning of all this, Emmeline? What are you trying to"
insinuate?”
"“If I thought you were going to adopt this tone, Everard, I should have"
kept my suspicions to myself.”
"“I certainly wish that you had,” said he, growing angry. “It is an"
insult to Yvonne which I cannot permit. My wife is above suspicion.”
"“Like Caesar’s,” said the lady with a curl of the lip. “Do you know that"
passing reference to yesterday's tragedy.
"""I didn't like him at all,"" she said; ""but still it's dreadful--a man"
"one knew ever so slightly!"""
"Alicia agreed, and the next instant she found herself practically alone"
with Medland; for Daisy ran off to pick a wild-flower that caught her
"eye in the wood, and Norburn followed her. Not knowing whether to be"
"glad or sorry, she made no effort to escape, and was silent while"
Medland began to speak of his prospects in that evening's division.
Suddenly she paused in her walk and lifted her eyes to his.
"""You look happier,"" she said."
Medland's conscience smote him: he was looking happier because the man
was dead.
"""It's at the prospect of being a free man to-morrow,"" he answered, with"
"a smile. ""You know, Cincinnatus was very happy."""
"""But you're not like that."""
"""No, I suppose not. Say it's----"""
"""Never mind."""
After a pause she made another attempt.
"""Mr. Medland!"""
"""Yes?"""
_gentleman_.”
"“Yes. Our gardener’s son has joined a circus too. Such an amusin’ boy,"
he was.”
"“It brings it all so home to one, doesn’t it!”"
"“Doesn’t it, indeed! But I confess I have always been fascinated by the"
stage. There’s somethin’ so very romantic about livin’ in green-rooms
"and paintin’ your face, and--pretendin’ to be someone else.”"
The other whispered in her ear.
"The lorgnettes were flicked open again, and glittered upon Sir Gilders"
Persimmon.
“Indeed! But he is so very old--and she--but there is such a difference
of social rank between a baronet’s wife and a mere painter--surely!
"Still, he _is_ very old. Almost permissible sin, Gerty.”"
They both tittered.
"“My dear,” said the other, “you are really quite naughty.”"
"Sir Gilders pounced upon Fosse, whom he had followed round the room,"
"put up a hand to aid his dull hearing, and said:"
“You were speaking of dotage----”
Fosse winced uneasily:
"“No, sir,” he shrieked--“I was _not_ talking of dotage. I say that the"
"""Exactly. Now read this,"" and he gave him the copy of a certificate of"
marriage between George Benyon and Margaret Aspland.
"""Quite so,"" nodded Kilshaw."
"""And this."""
"Kilshaw took the slip of newspaper, old and yellow. It contained a few"
"lines, briefly recording that Mrs. Benyon had left her home secretly by"
"night, in her husband's absence, and could not be found."
Kilshaw nodded again.
"""It doesn't surprise me,"" he said. ""I knew all this. I was in Mr."
"Benyon's confidence."""
"""Perhaps you can tell us how he lived?"" hazarded the Superintendent,"
with a shrewd look.
Mr. Kilshaw looked doubtful.
"""The inquest is fixed for to-morrow. The more we know now, the less it"
"will be necessary to protract it."""
"""I have been helping him lately,"" admitted Kilshaw; and he added, ""Look"
"here, Superintendent, I don't want that more talked about than"
"necessary."""
"""You needn't say a word to me now unless you like, sir; but I only want"
"to make things as comfortable as I can. You see, the coroner is bound to"
"look into it a bit. Had you given him money lately?"""
Now he is old: he asks for daily bread:
He who has sowed the bread he may not taste
Begs for the crumbs: he would do no man wrong.
"The Parish Guardians, when his case is read,"
Will grant him (yet with no unseemly haste)
"Just seventeen pence to starve on, seven days long."
THE ABSINTHE DRINKER.
GENTLY I wave the visible world away.
"Far off, I hear a roar, afar yet near,"
"Far off and strange, a voice is in my ear,"
And is the voice my own? the words I say
"Fall strangely, like a dream, across the day;"
"And the dim sunshine is a dream. How clear,"
"New as the world to lovers’ eyes, appear"
The men and women passing on their way!
The world is very fair. The hours are all
Linked in a dance of mere forgetfulness.
"I am at peace with God and man. O glide,"
"Sands of the hour-glass that I count not, fall"
Serenely: scarce I feel your soft caress.
Rocked on this dreamy and indifferent tide.
"she did so--""I suppose you've been too full of your politics to hear"
"much about the murder?"""
"""The murder?"" exclaimed the watchmaker. The doorkeeper crumpled up his"
"letter and stuffed it into the pocket of his coat, while his wife read"
to them the story of the discovery. The watchmaker listened with
interest.
"""Benham!"" he remarked. ""I never heard the name, did you?"""
"""You know him, Ned,"" said the doorkeeper's wife; ""him as Mr. Gaspard"
"used to go about with."""
"By a sudden common impulse, the eyes of the two men met; the woman went"
"off to brew them a pot of tea, and left them fearfully gazing at one"
another.
"""What stuff!"" said the watchmaker uneasily. ""It was only his blow. What"
"reason had he--?"" He paused and added, ""Seen him to-day, Ned?"""
"""No,"" answered Ned, fingering his note."
"""Wasn't he in the procession?"""
"""I didn't see him."""
"""When did you see him last?"""
The doorkeeper hesitated.
"""Night of our last committee,"" he whispered finally."
would send him word. In respect to giving him letters of introduction to
"influential persons in Spain, he had no objection."
They took leave of the abbé.
"“All this has to go slowly,” said Kennedy."
“Of course. One cannot insist that it should happen all at once.”
_BERNINI_
"“If you have nothing to do, let’s take a walk,” said the Englishman."
“If you like.”
“Have you noticed the fountains in this square?”
“No.”
“They are worth looking at.”
Cæsar contemplated the central obelisk. It is set on top of a rock
"hollowed out like a cavern, in the mouth of which a lion is seen."
Afterwards they looked at the fountains at the ends of the square.
"“The sculptures are by Bernini,” explained Kennedy. “Bernini belonged to"
"an epoch that has been very much abused by the critics, but nowadays he"
is much praised. He enchants me.”
"“It is rather a mixed style, don’t you think?”"
"""I can't."""
"""She'll be hurt, Alicia. She'll think you don't care. Come, dear."""
"""Tell her--tell her I'm coming directly. Eleanor, you must let me go,"""
and breaking away she fled into the house.
Eleanor went alone to seek Lady Eynesford. Somehow Alicia's words had
quenched her high spirits for the moment.
"""Poor child! I do hope she hasn't been foolish,"" she mused. ""Surely"
"after what Mary told her--! Oh dear, I'm afraid it isn't all as happy as"
"it is about Dick!"""
And then she indulged in some very cynical meditations on the advantages
"of being a person of shallow emotions and changeful fancies, until she"
"was roused by the sight of Medland and Norburn walking up to the house,"
to attend the Executive Council. From the window she closely watched
"the Premier as he approached; her mood wavered to and fro, but at last"
"she summed up her impressions by remarking,"
"""Well, I suppose one might."""
CHAPTER XXII.
THE STORY OF A PHOTOGRAPH.
There was a titter.
“Sharles ze Foorst--risen from ze dead!” announced Rippley.
“I say”--the affected drawl discovered Ffolliott. “Rippley told me it
"was a--fancy-dress--affair,” he said plaintively. “And to come early.”"
There was a wild shout of laughter.
"Ffolliott looked round nervously at the strange faces, and recognising"
"Aubrey at last, by the mirror, he said peevishly:"
“I am exceedingly displeased with Rippley--he--he chose my dress.”
Rippley wiped the tears from his eyes:
"“Well--don’t you see we are nearly all in disguise? ... except Aubrey,"
who thinks that because he looks like an ass no one will know him.” He
"turned to the others: “I say, boys,” he added, chuckling, “things are"
beginning to move at last. This _is_ going to be a unique night.”
“Hush!”
"They had all turned to Blotte, and a strange silence fell upon the room."
"Andrew Blotte stood listening, as to some strange sounds. He roused:"
"“Ay, I sup with the gods to-night.... And I can hear the guests"
arriving--all the clever fellows that have made the world a
delight--and with them come the dear dead companions that worked with
"us, and sang with us, and drank with us--in Paris.... I know them--they"
"haven't we, Tommy?"""
"""Double it,"" Tommy laughed. ""We agreed last night that you looked like a"
"million-dollar bill to us!"""
"""Oh, my boys,"" Monsieur sputtered with embarrassment and pleasure, ""you"
"disarm my power to thank you--see, I blush!"""
"""Damned if he isn't,"" Tommy grinned at me. ""What d'you know about this"
"little gezabo, anyhow!"""
Monsieur's face grew more composed as he showed his interest in a new
word.
"""You say--gazebo?"" he asked, blandly. ""Is that not a belvedere?"""
"""Gazebo is, yes; but I said gezabo--that's you!"""
"""Your American Indian language?"""
"""Sure thing. Pure talk. If you're interested in Indians, stick around."
"Why not get the Havana police to help us hunt the kiddie?""--I had known"
that before long Tommy would be using a first personal pronoun.
"""Bah! They are of no value! But even I have small hope of finding her."
"The report was written nearly six years ago, and she has been gone"
"upwards of twenty years."""
"""So it's a she,"" Tommy looked over at me and nodded. ""Well, nearly six"
"years, and upwards of twenty, plus what she was when she left home,"
leads me to believe the lady's almost old enough to take care of
"herself!"""
"""I don't know. I'm not a spaceman, responsible for the lives of three"
"people--at a hundred clams an hour."""
"""Some day I'm going to shove those hundred fish down your throat."""
"""Do. And I'll spit 'em back at you!"""
Norton roughly took her shoulders in his hands. He twisted her to face
"him, clamped down on her soft shoulders until she turned her face up"
to complain with welling eyes. He put his lips on hers and tried to
"force some warmth into them. She submitted calmly, and when he found no"
"response and opened his eyes, she was staring at him vacantly."
Abruptly he let her go. She relaxed in the seat.
"""I'm not afraid to work,"" he said in a hollow voice."
"""Prove it,"" she replied flatly."
"He got up, left her there, and went below."
V
Wilson sat in the Information Center and eyed the search grid glumly.
"It stretched stereoscopically out in the room, a lot of its vacant"
"network of gleaming white lines frosted over with white shading, to"
mark where the search had covered.
"""--what?"" fell from the Girl's lips, her face pale and set."
"""Are you deaf?"" demanded Rance; and then, emphasising every word, he"
"rasped out: ""The fellow you've been polkying with is the man that has"
"been asking people to hold up their hands."""
"""Oh, go on--you can't hand me out that!"" Nevertheless the Girl looked"
wildly about the room.
Angrily Rance strode over to her and sneered bitingly:
"""You don't believe it yet, eh?"""

"upon the last word. ""I know he isn't."""
"""Well, he _is_ Ramerrez, and he _did_ come to The Polka to rob it,"""
retorted the Sheriff.
All at once the note of resentment in the Girl's voice became positive;
"she flared back at him, though she flushed in spite of herself."
"""But he didn't rob it!"""
"""That's what gits me,"" fretted Sonora. ""He didn't."""
"""I should think it would git you,"" snapped back the Girl, both in her"

"“She is getting on,” said the Sister superintendent, frostily, “as well"
as can be expected.”
“Which means? Please tell me. I am here to know.”
"“She will take some time to recover from her injuries, and of course her"
nerve is broken.”
"“I'm afraid,” said John, “your institution can't afford many invalid's"
luxuries.”
"“None at all,” replied the weary-faced woman. “She gets proper care and"
"attention, however.”"
John drew out a five-pound note. “Can you buy her any little things
"with this? When you have spent it, if you will tell me, I 'll send you"
another.”
"“It's against our rules,” said the Sister, eying the money. “If you like"
"to give it as a subscription to the general funds, I will accept it.”"
“Are you badly off?” asked John.
“We are very slenderly endowed.”
John pushed the note across the small table near which they were
sitting.

real feelings.
"“I should like to see the dog,” remarked Kennedy simply."
"“Miss Sears,” asked her mistress, “will you get Buster, please?”"
The nurse left the room. No longer was there the laughing look on her
face. This was serious business.
"A few minutes later she reappeared, carrying gingerly a small dog"
basket. Mrs. Blake lifted the lid. Inside was a beautiful little
"“Peke,” and it was easy to see that Buster was indeed ill."
"“Who is your doctor?” asked Craig, considering."
"“Dr. Rae Wilson, a very well-known woman physician.”"
"Kennedy nodded recognition of the name. “What does she say?” he asked,"
observing the dog narrowly.
"“We haven’t told anyone, outside, of it yet,” replied Mrs. Blake. “In"

“You haven’t told anyone?”
“Only Reginald and my daughter Betty. Betty is frantic—not with fear

The Superintendent looked grave.

But Tommy was persistent at times. Unknown to me he was now preparing a

"""Oh, I've seen you improving from day to day, but we want to put it over"

And in all justice to myself and my friendship to Tommy I really did not

ACT I
The SCENE is the pretty drawing-room of a flat.  There are two
"doors, one open into the hall, the other shut and curtained."
"Through a large bay window, the curtains of which are not yet"
"drawn, the towers of Westminster can be seen darkening in a"
summer sunset; a grand piano stands across one corner.  The
"man-servant PAYNTER, clean-shaven and discreet, is arranging two"
tables for Bridge.
"BURNEY, the maid, a girl with one of those flowery Botticellian"
"faces only met with in England, comes in through the curtained"
"door, which she leaves open, disclosing the glimpse of a white"
"wall.  PAYNTER looks up at her; she shakes her head, with an"
expression of concern.
PAYNTER.  Where's she gone?
"BURNEY.  Just walks about, I fancy."
PAYNTER.  She and the Governor don't hit it!  One of these days
she'll flit--you'll see.  I like her--she's a lady; but these
thoroughbred 'uns--it's their skin and their mouths.  They'll go till
"they drop if they like the job, and if they don't, it's nothing but"
jib--jib--jib.  How was it down there before she married him?
"BURNEY.  Oh!  Quiet, of course."
"""You left her here?"" he inquired, interrupting.  ""Yes, in this very"
room.  But it seems that a quarter of an hour later one of the servants
"entered and discovered her lying upon the door, dead."""
"""Curious!"" he ejaculated.  ""Has a medical man seen her?"""
"""No.  The Countess sent for me as being one of her daughter's most"
"intimate friends, and I, in turn, sent for you."""
"""Where is the poor young lady?"""
"""In her room at the end of the corridor,"" I answered hoarsely."
"""Is there any suspicion of murder?"""
"""Apparently none whatever.  She had no visitor after I left."""
"""And no suspicion of suicide?"" he asked, with a sharp look.  ""Did you"
"part friends?"""
"""Perfectly so,"" I responded.  ""As to suicide, she had no reason, as far"
"as anyone knows, to make an attempt upon her life."""
He gave vent to an expression which sounded to me much like a grunt of
dissatisfaction.
"""Now, be perfectly frank with me, Gerald,"" he said, suddenly turning to"
"me and placing his hand upon my shoulder.  ""You loved her very dearly"
"once--was that not so?"""
I nodded.
last he stood still before her.
"“Among ordinary honourable people one takes such things for granted,” he"
said.
"“Forgive me,” she said again, humbly."
But he could find no pity for her in his heart. She had wronged him past
redemption.
“How much truth was there in the newspaper story?” he asked coldly.
She told him rapidly what Amédée Bazouge had said concerning his attack
in the hospital and his subsequent stroke.
“So the man is wilfully killing himself with absinthe?” he said.
"“It appears so,” replied Yvonne with a shudder."
“Could you tell me what passed between you otherwise--in general terms?”
"he asked, after a short silence. “You explained your position? Or did"
"you leave him in ignorance, as you were going to leave me?”"
“I told him--of course. It was necessary. And he laughed--I thought to
"spare you, Everard.”"
"“Spare me, Yvonne?”"
"“Yes,” she said, simply, “I could have borne all the pain and fright"
of it alone--why should I have made you unhappy? And _he_ said he would
"never interfere with me, and I can trust his word. Why should I have"
"told you, Everard?”"
"board H.M.S. _King Fisher_. Eventually he reached Bristol, where he"
"bought, with his share of booty, a horse and two pistols, with which to go"
on the highway.
"Hanged on June 17th, 1747, for stealing an old silver watch and 5s. from"
Mr. Francis Sleep at Dunstable.
"SKIPTON, CAPTAIN."
"Commanded a pirate ship, in which he sailed in company with Captain"
"Spriggs. Being chased by H.M.S. _Diamond_ off the coast of Cuba, Skipton"
"ran his sloop on to the Florida Reef. Escaping with his crew to an island,"
"they were attacked by the Indians, and many of them were captured and"
"eaten. The survivors, embarking in a canoe, were caught by the man-of-war"
and taken prisoner.
"SKYRM, CAPTAIN JAMES. Welsh pirate."
Hanged at the advanced age--for a pirate--of 44.
"Commanded the _Ranger_, one of Captain Roberts's ships that cruised in"
1721 and 1722 off the West Coast of Africa. In the fight with the King's
"ship that took him he was very active with a drawn sword in his hand, with"
which he beat any of his crew who were at all backward. One of his legs
"was shot away in this action, but he refused to leave the deck and go"
below as long as the action lasted. He was condemned to death and hanged
in chains.
"SMITH, GEORGE. Welsh pirate."
"the sea outside and the flowers in the delft bowl laughed, too."
“The angel has been having a good time.”
John cleared his throat again.
"“My dear,” said he, and then he stopped short. All the carefully"
prepared exordiums went out of his head. How now to break the news to
her he did not know.
“Are you very tired?” she asked.
"“Not a bit,” said John."
"“Then be a dear, and read me something. Read me 'Elaine.' ”"
The elevated and sophisticated and very highly educated may learn
with surprise that “The Idylls of the King” still appeal to ingenuous
fifteen. Thank God there are yet remaining also some sentimentalists of
fifty who can read them with pleasure and profit!
"“But that is so sad, Stellamaris,” said John. “You don't want to be sad"
this beautiful spring morning.”
"Which was a very inconsistent remark to make, seeing that he was about"
to dash the young sun from her sky altogether.
"“I like being sad sometimes, especially when the world is bright."
"And Lancelot was such a dear,”--here spoke ingenuous fifteen,--“and"
"Elaine--oh, do read it!”"
"So John, secretly glad of a respite, drew from the bookcase which held"
"voice. ""The Swabian dynasty is no more."""
"With a cry and a sob that shook his whole being, Francesco covered his"
face with his hands.
For a moment the duke stared blankly at the speaker.
"""And the Frangipani?"" he asked, his features ashen-gray and drawn."
The messenger pointed to Astura.
"""There is feasting and high glee: the Pontiff's bribe was large.""--"
Francesco trembled in every limb.
"""Such a day was never seen in Naples,"" the messenger concluded with a"
"shudder. ""To a man they died under the axe--the soil was dyed crimson"
"with their blood."""
There was a silence.
"The messenger pointed to the sea, which had melted into the indefinite"
background of the night.
"Dim and distant, like a pearl over the purple deeps, one sail after"
"another struck out of the vague west. They came heading for the land,"
the black hulls rising and falling against the tumultuous blackness of
the clouds.
A red gleam started suddenly from the waves. A quick flame leaped up
like a red finger above the cliff.
"""Another thief crep' into camp,"" coldly observed the Girl almost"
simultaneously with the report.
Johnson winced.
"""Poor devil!"" he muttered. ""But of course, as you say, he's only a"
"thief."""
In reply to which the Girl uttered words to the effect that she was glad
he had been caught.
"""Well, you're right,"" said Johnson, thoughtfully, after a short silence;"
"then determinedly and in short jerky sentences, he went on: ""I've been"
thinking that I must go--tear myself away. I have very important
"business at dawn--imperative business . . ."""
"The Girl, who now stood by the table folding up the white cloth cover,"
"watched him out of the corner of her eye, take down his coat from the"
peg on the wall.
"""Ever sample one o' our mountain blizzards?"" she asked as he slipped on"
"his coat. ""In five minutes you wouldn't know where you was. Your"
important business would land you at the bottom of a canyon 'bout twenty
"feet from here."""
Johnson cleared his throat as if to speak but said nothing; whereupon
the Girl continued:
"""You say you believe in Fate. Well, Fate has caught up with you--you got"
"to stay here."""
"Andrews chuckled. ""I'll do better than our young pilot friend. The man"
"is big, and should be muscular, but he is soft from lack of exercise."
"Yet he'll attempt to stay there longer than I did, I guess."""
"""No doubt."""
"He eyed her sharply, not missing her repetitious dry reply."
"""Which, incidentally,"" he said, ""gives me my first chance to speak with"
"you alone since we took off from Earth."""
"""That's so. But--"""
"""Miss Hemingway, you are an exceedingly brisk young woman, attractive"
"and intelligent. May I ask if you have ever taken a lover?"""
"""Why, no."""
"""Never considered it?"""
"She smiled thinly. ""Naturally. All women think about it. Most do."
"I--er--"""
"Alice let her voice trail away uncertainly. The direct, frontal attack"
"had put her off-balance, but she realized that this was Andrews' direct"
way.
"He had smiled at her uncertainty, and said swiftly, ""Then may I be the"
"first--"" when he noted the fading amusement in her face and glibly ad"
"libbed--""to congratulate you on your choice of young men? The space"
commodore to whom you bade farewell in Chicago was an up and coming
"man, I'd assume."""
"“H’m, h’m!--yes. Pills.”"
“Mr. Pangbutt’s father?”
"“H’m, h’m! Yes. I assure you.”"
“Dear me! And he has such a very distinguished manner!”
“And--d’you know?”
She whispered.
“Lady Persimmon? Indeed?”
The lady of the lorgnettes nodded mysteriously. The withered eyes
expressed shocked surprise. She gave a funny little laugh. The
"lorgnettes were raised again, and she said, surveying the assembled"
guests critically through the glasses:
“I absolutely _adore_ literary people--and artists--and actors--and
those sort of persons. It is so strange to think they have all slept
"in attics. And really, it’s quite the _fashion_ to go on the stage"
now.... Who’s the fright in the post-office red?... Oh! is it?... Lady
"Margaret’s son has gone on the stage.... Gerty, do you know who that"
"dark creature is? with the Italian-looking person.... Oh, yes; and the"
"young fellow is getting on wonderfully. You see, they like to have"
"a gentleman on the stage--besides, he acts in the most gentlemanly"
"manner--quite unlike a professional actor. And then, of course, his"
manager is rather exclusive--he called the company together the other
"day, and told them that he did not expect them to recognise him in"
the street. It’s so nice for the young fellow to be with such a
"let a lady go to bed?"""
One by one the men filed through the door which Nick held open for them;
"but when all but himself had left, the devoted little barkeeper turned"
"to the Girl with a look full of meaning, and whispered:"
"""Do you want me to stay?"""
"""Me? Oh, no, Nick!"" And with a ""Good-night, all! Good-night, Sonora, an'"
"thank you! Good-night, Nick!"" the Girl closed the door upon them. The"
last that she heard from them was the muffled ejaculation:
"""Oh, Lordy, we'll never git down to Cloudy to-night!"""
Now the Girl slid the bolts and stood with her back against the door as
"if to take extra precautions to bar out any intrusion, and with eyes"
that blazed she yelled out:
"""Come out o' that, now! Step out there, Mr. Johnson!"""
Slowly the road agent parted the curtains and came forward in an
attitude of dejection.
"""You came here to rob me,"" at once began the Girl, but her anger made it"
impossible for her to continue.
"""I didn't,"" denied the road agent, quietly, his countenance reflecting"
how deeply hurt he was by her words.
"""You lie!"" insisted the Girl, beside herself with rage."
"""I don't--"""
"Germans, or any other barbarians.”"
"“Yes, this hotel is a hive of petty aristocrats.”"
“Your sister was telling me that you might pick out a very rich wife
"here, among the girls.”"
"“Yes, my sister would like me to live here, in a foreign country, in"
"cowlike tranquillity, looking at pictures and statues, and travelling"
pointlessly. That wouldn’t be living for me; I am not a society man. I
"require excitement, danger.... Though I warn you that I am not in the"
least courageous.”
“You’re not?”
“Not at all. Not now. At moments I believe I could control myself and
take a trench without wavering.”
"“But you have some fixed plan, haven’t you?”"
"“Yes, I expect to go back to Spain, and work there.”"
“At what?”
“In politics.”
“Are you patriotic?”
"“Yes, up to a certain point. I have no transcendental idea of patriotism"
"at all. Patriotism, as I interpret it, is a matter of curiosity. I"
believe that there is strength in Spain. If this strength could be
"led in a given direction, where would it get to? That is my form of"
"harm."""
"""No; nothing will do anybody harm if it gives you pleasure."""
"At that bitter retort, he kept silence a long time, now and then heaving"
"a long sigh.  His words kept sounding in her heart: ""The soul, not the"
"body, is faithful.""  Was he, after all, more faithful to her than she had"
"ever been, could ever be--who did not love, had never loved him?  What"
"right had she to talk, who had married him out of vanity, out of--what?"
And suddenly he said:
"""Gyp!  Forgive!"""
"She uttered a sigh, and turned away her face."
"He bent down against the eider-down.  She could hear him drawing long,"
"sobbing breaths, and, in the midst of her lassitude and hopelessness, a"
"sort of pity stirred her.  What did it matter?  She said, in a choked"
voice:
"""Very well, I forgive."""

The human creature has wonderful power of putting up with things. Gyp

instinct told her that what Fiorsen might honestly mean to do was very

"weather isn't half as rough as 'the old dear' will be, take my word for"
"it!"""
"A shadow of mystification passed over her wonderful face, yet she smiled"
"with well-bred tolerance, saying:"
"""You are quite droll."""
"""Drollery is the brother of good fellowship,"" I replied, helping her"
"across the reeling cabin. As I had feared, she went directly to my room"
where the door had swung back showing an empty bunk.
"""Why, he's up, after all,"" she glanced over her shoulder at me."
"""I believe he is,"" I idiotically affirmed."
"""But where?""--this more to herself."
"""Hiding, maybe,"" I ventured, taking a facetious squint about."
"""Hiding?"" she asked, in mild surprise."

"""Don't laugh!"""
"""I'm not laughing,"" as indeed he was not."

"he's good, he's gran' an' he can have me."""
"""I could have you,"" murmured Johnson, meditatively."
The Girl nodded eagerly.
There was a long silence in which Johnson was trying to make up his mind
"to tear himself away from her,--the one woman whom he loved in the"
"world,--for it had been slowly borne in upon him that he was not a fit"
mate for this pure young girl. Nor was his unhappiness lessened when he
"recalled how she had struggled against yielding to him. At last,"
"difficult though it was, he took his courage in both hands, and said:"
"""Girl, I have looked into your heart and my own and now I realise what"
"this means for us both--for you, Girl--and knowing that, it seems hard"
"to say good-bye as I should, must and will . . ."""

CHAPTER XVIII
"""HOOK!"""
Sidney found it a little difficult to take up the fun with her
erstwhile chums where she had left off. When she stopped at the
"Calkins' house directly after breakfast, Mart coolly declined to go"
"anywhere with her, and smiled scornfully at her bare legs."
"""I s'pose your million-dollar friend is otherwise engaged today!"""
"Sidney truthfully admitted that she was. ""She's gone to Chatham with"
her mother to see some people they know. And I'm glad. I've been just
"dying for a good swim. Let's go out to the _Arabella_ this morning."""
But Mart declared she was tired of all that. In fact she was tired of
doing lots of the silly things they'd been doing. She'd promised Gert
Bartow to go there right after lunch.
Sidney had no choice but to go on alone in search of Lav. She was
discouraged to the point of tears. Yet she knew in her heart that she
deserved Mart's coldness. She remembered how she had felt once when
Nancy had deserted her for a new girl at Miss Downs'. And it had
seriously threatened their friendship.
As she wandered slowly toward the town Sidney wondered what Mart and
Gert Bartow were going to do. Gert Bartow was a girl of nineteen at
"least, and much more grown up than even that. Mart had pointed her out"
to Sidney. Sidney wished Mart had asked her to go with her to Gert's.
She felt very lonely.
“Quick!” he repeated.
It was too late.
"“For God’s sake, Kennedy,” shouted a voice at the street door, “what"
are you doing here?”
"It was McLear himself. He had come with the Hale patrol, on his mettle"
now to take care of the epidemic of robberies.
Before Craig could reply a cab drew up with a rush at the curb and two
"men, half fighting, half cursing, catapulted themselves into the shop."
They were Winters and Moulton.
"Without a word, taking advantage of the first shock of surprise,"
Kennedy had clapped a piece of chemical paper on the foreheads of Mrs.
"Moulton, then of Moulton, and on Muller’s. Oblivious to the rest of us,"
he studied the impressions in the full light of the counter.
Moulton was facing his wife with a scornful curl of the lip.
“I’ve been told of the paste replica—and I wrote Schloss that I’d shoot
"him down like the dog he is, you—you traitress,” he hissed."
She drew herself up scornfully.
“And I have been told why you married me—to show off your wicked jewels
and help you in your—”
“You lie!” he cried fiercely. “Muller—some one—open this safe—whosever
"it is. If what I have been told is true, there is in it one new bag"
"listlessly, and his large head drooped forward as if at last its weight"
had proven too great for the squat body.
"""What's wrong?"" I asked."
"""How do you know there is anything wrong, my boy Jack?"""
"""You look so killingly happy,"" Tommy said, joining us."
"Monsieur's pale eyes stared for a moment, then blinked several times"
before he murmured:
"""The man I went to see is dead--murdered, just after he mailed that"
report. So I have no information. These police called it suicide because
a knife lay in his hand. Bah! I could place a knife in the hand of any
"man I kill!"""
"""Was he a friend of yours?"""
"""No. I have never seen him. But he knew something!"""
"""He evidently knew too much,"" Tommy suggested."
"""You speak true, my boy. It seems to be a dangerous thing here to know"
"too much of certain matters!"""
"""Well,"" I laughed, trying to put a heartiness in my voice and drive away"
"his depression, ""let's go ashore for dinner! Then the Opera--and"
"afterwards another bite where the high life eats? What-say, Professor?"""
"As it turned out, however, neither the dinner, nor all of Tommy's"
"banter, nor Madame Butterfly sung in Spanish (as if it could!) succeeded"
"that scoundrel, not if you do divorce 'im.  No; she'll have her disgrace"
"for nothing."""
"Gyp, who had listened with her head a little bent, raised it suddenly,"
and said:
"""There'll be no public disgrace, Mr. Wagge, unless you make it yourself."
If you send Daphne--Daisy--quietly away somewhere till her trouble's
"over, no one need know anything."""
"Mr. Wagge, whose mouth had opened slightly, and whose breathing could"
"certainly have been heard in the street, took a step forward and said:"
"""Do I understand you to say that you're not goin' to take proceedings,"
"ma'am?"""
"Gyp shuddered, and shook her head."
"Mr. Wagge stood silent, slightly moving his face up and down."
"""Well,"" he said, at length, ""it's more than she deserves; but I don't"
"disguise it's a relief to me.  And I must say, in a young lady like you,"
"and--and handsome, it shows a Christian spirit."" Again Gyp shivered, and"
"shook her head.  ""It does.  You'll allow me to say so, as a man old"
"enough to be your father--and a regular attendant."""
He held out his hand.  Gyp put her gloved hand into it.
"""I'm very, very sorry.  Please be nice to her."""
"Mr. Wagge recoiled a little, and for some seconds stood ruefully rubbing"
his hands together and looking from side to side.
"Winstanley, after Yvonne had gone again."
"“I am sacrificing them for my wife’s happiness, Emmeline,” he replied,"
with a touch of irony.
"“Yes, it would be a pity to spoil her pleasure. She is such a child.”"
"“I wish we all had something of her nature,” said the Canon."
Mrs. Winstanley noted the snub. She was treasuring up many resentments
against Yvonne. In her heart she considered herself a long-suffering
woman.
"“You seem to enjoy it too, Everard,” said Yvonne to him that evening."
They were sitting near the entrance watching the smartly-dressed people.
“And I am so glad to be alone with you.”
"He was pleased, smiled at her, and throwing off his dignity, entered"
into the frivolous spirit of the place. Yvonne forgot the restraint she
had always put upon her tongue when talking to him. She chattered about
"everything, holding her face near him, so as to be heard through the"
"hubbub of thousands of voices, the eternal shuffling of passing feet,"
and the crash of the orchestra in the far gallery.
"“It is a _Revue des Deux Mondes,_” she said, looking rapidly around"
"her, with bright eyes."
“How?” asked the Canon.
"“The _beau_ and the _demi_,” she replied, wickedly. She shook his knee."
"“Oh, do look at that woman! what does she think a man can see in her!”"
Travers seized his arm. His eyes shone with a painful excitement.
"""Yes--yes!"" he stammered. ""You have a chance--a sure hope. I can save"
you; I can--atone. That's what I want. Only you must help me. I am a
dying man. I want you to bring me to the Rajah--at once. Only five
minutes with him--that will be enough. Then he will let you go--he
"must!"""
Nicholson freed himself resolutely from the clinging hands.
"""You exaggerate your power,"" he said, ""and, besides, what you ask is"
"an impossibility."""
"He turned away, but Travers caught his arm and held him with a"
"frantic, desperate strength."
"little given to humiliating your neighbours, male or female....”"
"“Yes, yes; but we are not so conceited or such play-actors as you are."
"A woman may think herself pretty and amiable and sweet, and not be so."
"That is true; but on the other hand, every man thinks himself braver"
"than the Cid, even if he is afraid of a fly, and more talented than"
"Seneca, even if he is a dolt.”"

“Just so.”
“And women spend their lives fishing for these calamities.”

spring. The illumination showed a moldy chamber with water dripping from
the walls in places.
At some distant day the chamber had evidently been occupied by human
"beings, for a great fire-place was cut in the rock at one end, and there"
were niches in the wall which had doubtless been used for storage. The
"floor was smooth, showing the work of human hands."
“Get onto the fire-place!” whispered Jimmie. “Where do you suppose the
smoke goes? There’s no chimney on the mountain.”
"“Probably it escapes through some opening in the rock,” Ned answered."
"“Do you suppose,” Jimmie asked, “that the smoke vent is large enough for"
us to hide in?”
"Before the words were out of the boy’s mouth, Ned was making toward the"
"fireplace. The light was out now, but Jimmie had no difficulty in"
following the boy in the darkness.
“Ned!” he called softly in a moment.
“Come on up!” whispered Ned.
"“Turn on the light, then,” Jimmie advised."
"Ned switched on the electric, but kept it inside the chimney into which"
he had climbed. Only a faint radiance reached the opening below.
"“Give me your hand,” whispered Ned, “and I’ll give you a lift.”"
The sound of voices and footsteps now echoed loudly through the cavern.
King Merriwig of Euralia sat at breakfast on his castle walls.  He
"lifted the gold cover from the gold dish in front of him, selected a"
trout and conveyed it carefully to his gold plate.  He was a man of
"simple tastes, but when you have an aunt with the newly acquired gift"
"of turning anything she touches to gold, you must let her practise"
sometimes.  In another age it might have been fretwork.
"""Ah,"" said the King, ""here you are, my dear.""  He searched for his"
"napkin, but the Princess had already kissed him lightly on the top of"
"the head, and was sitting in her place opposite to him."
"""Good morning, Father,"" she said; ""I'm a little late, aren't I?  I've"
"been riding in the forest."""
"""Any adventures?"" asked the King casually."
"""Nothing, except it's a beautiful morning."""
"""Ah, well, perhaps the country isn't what it was.  Now when I was a"
"young man, you simply couldn't go into the forest without an adventure"
"of some sort.  The extraordinary things one encountered!  Witches,"
"giants, dwarfs----.  It was there that I first met your mother,"" he"
added thoughtfully.
"""I wish I remembered my mother,"" said Hyacinth."
The King coughed and looked at her a little nervously.
"""Seventeen years ago she died, Hyacinth, when you were only six months"
old.  I have been wondering lately whether I haven't been a little

"Dennis went clumsily to his knees, his arms around her, and he pulled"
"her to the floor. She sobbed, but the tears were gone now and they were"
"dry, wracking sobs."
"""Undress me."""
She fumbled with his jacket and pulled it off while he knelt there in
"anticipation of he knew not what; wondering, wanting, knowing only an"
urge he could not understand but which had become a compulsion.
She took off his necktie and unbuttoned his shirt. Frank Corson stirred
"but did not regain consciousness. ""Please,"" Rhoda said, ""let me help"
"him."""
"In answer, Dennis put his arms around her and drew her to him. ""We will"
"make love."""
"""Yes--yes, we will make love--"""
"The ring of the doorbell was like thunder in the room. Dennis tensed,"
"his eyes widened, and he got to his feet and stood swaying. Looking up"
"at him, Rhoda saw a trapped animal, but the excitement was still there"
and she wanted to take him in her arms and hold him and protect him from
the world.
But he had forgotten her. A cunning sneer took the place of the
slavering animal look and he ran to the kitchen to reappear moments
later with a butcher knife in his hand.
"The bell rang again. Dennis snarled at the door and, in some kind of"
The orator finished his speech and looked upon his hearers with his
"dark, pathetic eyes, seeming to apologise to them for some unknown"
crime.
The public understands it.  They understand the morale of the creature
"who was once a man, the morale of the public-house and much misfortune."

Yakov understood that to beat her incautiously might be injurious to
"his wife.  He is silent, replying to his companions' jokes with"
confused smiles.
"""Then again, what is a wife?"" philosophises the baker, Mokei Anisimoff."
"""A wife ... is a friend ... if we look at the matter in that way.  She"
"is like a chain, chained to you for life ... and you are both just like"
"galley slaves.  And if you try to get away from her, you cannot, you"
"feel the chain ..."""
"""Wait,"" says Yakovleff; ""but you beat your wife too."""
"""Did I say that I did not?  I beat her...  There is nothing else"

And Simcox went below.

she saw the ruin that had been inflicted:

*CHAPTER VIII.*
*A STARTLING DISCOVERY.*
As Grey Dumaresq drifted downstream with the tide that sunny July
"morning, he felt as though something new and wonderful had come into his"
"life, as though some great and marvellous change had fallen upon him,"
"which, for good or ill, must leave its mark upon his life."
The pair drifted away.
And there is something else I cannot finish doing: withdrawing into
"solitude in the woods, alone with the good darkness round me. This is the"
last pleasure.
"One needs solitude and darkness, not because one flees the company of"
"others and can endure only one's own, but because of their quality of"
"loftiness and religion. Strange how all things pass distantly, yet all is"
near; we sit in an omnipresence. It must be God. It must be ourselves as a
part of all things.
"What would my heart, where would I stray?"
Shall I leave the forest behind me?
It was my home but yesterday;
now toward the city I wend my way;
to the darkness of night I've resigned me.
"The world round me sleeps as I tarry, alone,"
soothing my ear with its quiet.
How large and gray is the city of stone
in which the many all hopes enthrone!
"Shall I, too, accept their fiat?"
Hark! Do the bells ring on the hillside?
Back to the peace of the forest I turn
in the nightly hour that's hoarest.
There's a sweet-smelling hedgerow to which I yearn;
"I shall rest my head on heather and fern,"
and sleep in the depths of the forest.
For an instant Brand was dumbfounded. For here was language he could
understand--which was incredible on this far-flung globe. Then he
suddenly comprehended why her sentences were so intelligible.
She was versed in mental telepathy. And versed to a high degree! He'd
had some experience with telepathy on Venus; but theirs was a crude
thought-speech compared to the fluency possessed by the beautiful girl
before him.
"""Who are you?"" he asked wonderingly."
"""I am Greca""--it was very hard to grasp names or abstract terms--""of"
"the fourth satellite."""
"""Then you are not of these monsters of Jupiter?"""
"""Oh, no! I am their captive, as are all my people. We are but slaves"
"of the tall ones."""
"Brand glanced at Dex. ""Here's a chance to get some information,"
"perhaps,"" he murmured."
Dex nodded; but meanwhile the girl had caught his thought. She
"smiled--a tragic, wistful smile."
"""I shall be happy to tell you anything in my power to tell,"" she"
"informed him. ""But you must be quick. I can only remain with you a"
"little while."""
She sat down on the floor with them--the few bench-like things
obviously used by the tall creatures as chairs were too high for
"adopt her now,” said Miss Lindon, with an illuminating flash of logic."
"“Quite so,” replied John."
There was a span of silence. John mechanically drew his pipe from his
"pocket, eyed it with longing, and replaced it. Miss Lindon took the aged"
black-and-tan terrier in her arms and whispered to it in baby language.
She was a million leagues from divining the object of her nephew's
visit. John looked at her despairingly. Had she not a single grain of
"common sense? At last he strode across the room, a Gulliver in a new"
"Lilliput, and sat down again by her side."
"“Look here, 'Aunt Gladys,” he said desperately, “if I adopt a young"
"woman of sixteen, I must have another woman in the house--a lady, one"
of my own family. I could n't have people saying horrid things about her
and me.”
Miss Lindon assented to the proposition. John was far too young and
"good-looking (“Oh, Lord!” cried John)--yes, he was--to pose as the"
"father of a pretty, grown-up young woman."
"“The poor child is n't pretty,” said he."
"“It does n't matter,” replied Miss Lindon. “Beauty is only skin deep,"
and I 've known plain people who are quite fascinating. There was
Captain Brownlow's wife--do you remember the Brownlows? Your poor mother
was so fond of them--”
"“Yes, yes,” said John, impatiently. “He had wet hands, and used to mess"
"my face about when I was a kid. I hated it. The question is, however,"
whom am I going to get to help me with Unity Blake?”
affair.  The very existence of the secret has brought us together
"again."""
"""You mean that you have forsaken Edith and returned to her?"" he"
"observed, raising his brows slightly in surprise."
"""No; don't put it in that way,"" I implored.  ""I have not yet forsaken"
"Edith."""
"He smiled, just a trifle superciliously, I thought."
"""And the Countess is also in possession of this mysterious secret--eh?"""
"""Of that I am not at all certain,"" I replied."
He sniffed in distinct suspicion that what I had told him was not the
"truth.  At the same instant, however, the Countess entered and demanded"
to know the condition of her child.
"""She is much better, madame,"" he answered.  ""Perfect quiet is, however,"
"necessary, and constant observation of the temperature.  To-morrow, or"
"the day after, you may, I think, see her."""
"""Not till then!"" she cried.  ""I cannot wait so long."""
"""But it is necessary.  Your daughter's life hangs upon a single thread."""
"She was silenced, for she saw that argument was useless."
A few minutes later Jean entered with a message from Trepard asking Dick
"and myself to consult with him.  We therefore left the Countess again,"
and passed along the corridor to the room in which my love of long ago
He has taken his staff for the Pilgrim's way.
"His sandals are girt on his tender feet,"
And he carries his scrip for what gifts he may.
"What will you give to him, Fate Divine?"
What for his scrip on the winding road?
"A crown for his head, or a laurel wreath?"
"A sword to wield, or is gold his load?"
What will you give him for weal or woe?
What for the journey through day and night?
"Give or withhold from him power and fame,"
But give to him love of the earth's delight.
Let him be lover of wind and sun
And of falling rain; and the friend of trees;
"With a singing heart for the pride of noon,"
And a tender heart for what twilight sees.
Let him be lover of you and yours--
"The Child and Mary; but also Pan,"
"And the sylvan gods of the woods and hills,"
And the god that is hid in his fellow-man.
"Love and a song and the joy of earth,"
These be the gifts for his scrip to keep
"Till, the journey ended, he stands at last"
"In the gathering dark, at the gate of sleep."
_Ethel Clifford._
And so our stories should contain all the essentials for the child's
"scrip on the road of life, providing the essentials and holding or"
"The Frenchmen ""jabbered"" a bit among themselves."
"""Quoi donc?  Marcher?"" asked their skipper."
"""We, old son,"" said Hart; ""marshay if you like.  Just pack up and"
quit.  We gives you an hour to gather up your dunnage.  Now do you
"understand?"""
Whether the Frenchmen understood or not it was tolerably obvious they
"did not like the tone with which Hart spoke, or the looks of evident"
disfavour he cast at them.  The captain turned away.
"""Stop!"" said Hart, and he went in for a dumb pantomime, in which he"
vaguely suggested that over yonder hill was an army of Englishmen.
"""And we mean 'avin' our rights,"" he ended with.  And just then old"
Jones appeared in sight.
"""Are they jossers goin' to evacuate or not?"" he bellowed.  ""What's"
their captain say to the _statues quo_?  Don't they know the first
thing about diplomatics?  Tell 'em that to prepare for peace we makes
"war."""
"""War it is,"" said Hart, and he launched himself at a crowd of"
"Frenchmen, as his mates came tumbling down the hill."
"The fight was short, sharp, and pretty decisive, for the _Potluck's_"
"crowd numbered ten able seamen, one ordinary seaman, and two boys, or"
"with the captain and the two mates, sixteen in all.  Against this"
"array there were twenty-one Frenchmen, and though Hart, in his first"
"onslaught, knocked down two, he was himself stretched out by a third"
armed with a broken hand-spike.  And Simcox fled with the infuriated
"Dawson came back after a few minutes, picked up another cigar from"
"Cary's box, and sat down. ""You see, I have a letter from him. I found"
"it in his quarters where I went straight from the _Malplaquet_."""
"""May we read it?"" I asked gently. ""I was greatly taken with Trehayne"
"myself. He was a clean, beautiful boy. He was an enemy officer on"
"Secret Service; there is no dishonour in that. If he were alive, I"
could shake his hand as the officer of the firing party shook the hand
"of Lody before he gave the last order."""
"Dawson took a paper from his pocket, and handed it to me. ""Read it"
"out,"" said he; ""I can't."""
CHAPTER VIII
TREHAYNE'S LETTER
I took the letter from Dawson and glanced through it. The first sheet
and the last had been written very recently--just before the boy had
left his quarters for the last time to go on board the _Malplaquet_;
the remainder had been set down at various times; and the whole had
"been connected up, put together, and paged after the completion of the"
"last sheet. Trehayne wrote a pretty hand, firm and clear, the writing"
of an artist who was also a trained engineer. There was no trace in
the script of nervousness or of hesitation. He had carried out his
"Orders, he saw clearly that the path which he had trod was leading him"
"to the end of his journey, but he made no complaint. He was a Latin,"
"“Phoebe,” she said, when the angular and jilted maid appeared, “we are"
"going to keep house for my nephew, Mr. Risca, and a young lady whom"
he has adopted. Will you tell me one thing? Is the lady of the house
supposed to clean the gentlemen's pipes?”
"“My father is a non-smoker, as well as a teetotaler, miss,” replied"
Phoebe.
“Dear me!” murmured Miss Lindon. “It's going to be a great puzzle.”
CHAPTER VII
"IT was a puzzle to John as much as to the palpitating lady, and in the"
maze of his puzzledom the gleam of humour that visited him during
"their interview lost its way. Walter Herold's eyes, however, twinkled"
maliciously when he heard John's account at once rueful and pig-headed.
Then he grew serious.
“It will be comic opera all the time. It can't be done.”
"“It 's going to be done,” said John, obstinately. “There's nothing else"
"to do. If I were a rich man, I could work wonders with a scratch in my"
cheque-book. I could hire an unexceptionable colonel's or clergyman's
widow to do the business. But I'm not. How I'm going to get the house
"together, as it is, I don't know. Besides,” he added, turning with some"
"savageness on his friend, “if you think it a comic-opera idea, kindly"
remember it was you who started it.”
"Though Herold was silenced for the moment, to the back of his mind still"
not remember who gave me which.”
“Let us think. What sort of a stone would a politician be most likely to
choose?”
Mrs. Pendleton laughed. “A good idea. If couleur de rose be synonymous
"with conceit, then I think the ruby must have come from Mr. Trent.”"
"“I am sure of it. And as your author is always in the dumps, I am"
certain he takes naturally to the sapphire.”
“But the emerald—”
“Is emblematic of your deluded Teddy. The solitaire therefore falls
"naturally to Mr. Severance. Well, now that you have got through the"
"first interviews in safety, what are you going to do next?”"
"“Edith, I do not know. They are all so dreadfully in earnest that I"
"believe I shall finally take to my heels in down-right terror. But no, I"
won’t. I’ll come out of it with the upper hand and save my reputation as
"an actress. I will keep it up for two or three days more, but after that"
it will be impossible. They are bound to meet here sooner or later.
"Thank Heaven, we are rid of them for to-night, at least!”"
The manservant threw back the portière.
“Mr. Trent!”
"“Heavens!” cried Edith, under her breath; “I forgot to give orders that"
"we were not receiv—how do you do, Mr. Trent?”"
“And which is his ring?” Jessica made a frenzied dab at the jewels in
a case of a woman of her caliber gone wrong.
“But you must have read of the famous Moulton diamonds?”
"“Yes,” said Craig, blankly, as if it were all news to him."
“Schloss has them—or at least had them. The jewels she wore at the
"opera this winter were paste, I understand.”"
“Does Moulton play?” he asked.
"“I think so—but not here, naturally. In a way, I suppose, it is his"
fault. They all do it. The example of one drives on another.”
"Instantly there flashed over my mind a host of possibilities. Perhaps,"
"after all, Winters had been right. Schloss had taken this way to make"
sure of the jewels so that she could not redeem them. Suddenly another
"explanation crowded that out. Had Mrs. Moulton robbed the safe herself,"
"or hired some one else to do it for her, and had that person gone back"
on her?
Then a horrid possibility occurred to me. Whatever Antoinette Moulton
"may have been and done, some one must have her in his power. What a"
situation for the woman! My sympathy went out to her in her supreme
"struggle. Even if it had been a real robbery, Schloss might easily"
recover from it. But for her every event spelled ruin and seemed only
to be bringing that ruin closer.
"We left Winters, still watching on the trail of Schloss, and went on"
uptown to the laboratory.
"“Powder,” answered the Canon. “She has been using her puff too freely.”"
"“She has been putting it on with a _muff_,” cried Yvonne."
He laughed. Yvonne had such a triumphant air in delivering herself of
little witticisms.
"A magnificently dressed woman, in a great feathered hat and low-dress,"
"with diamonds gleaming at her neck, passed by. “You are right, I fear,"
"about the two worlds,” said the Canon."
“Are n’t there crowds of them? I like to look at them because they wear
such beautiful things. And they fit so. And then to rub shoulders with
"them makes one feel so delightfully wicked. You know, I knew a girl"
once--she went in for that life of her own accord and she was awfully
happy. Really. Is n’t it odd?”
"“My dear Yvonne!” said the Canon, somewhat shocked, “I sincerely trust"
"you did not continue the acquaintance, afterwards.”"
"“Oh, no,” she replied, sagely. “It would not have done for me at all."
A lone woman can’t be too careful. But I used to hear about her from my
dressmaker.”
Her point of view was not exactly the Canon’s. But further discussion
"was stopped by the arrival of the Wilmingtons, who carried off Yvonne"
"to the dancing-room. The Canon, drawing the line at his own appearance"
"there, strolled back contentedly to the hotel to finish the evening over"
a book.
Two mornings afterwards Yvonne was walking by herself along the _digue_.
"They were to leave for Switzerland the next day, and she determined to"
"want you to know. I tried to keep it from you, Everard! Don’t look at me"
like that?”
Her voice ended in a note of fright. For the Canon’s face had grown
ashen and wore an expression of incredulous horror. He shook her from
him.
“Do you mean that this is true? That you met your first husband this
morning?”
"“Yes,” said she, with quivering lips. Question and answer were too"
categorical for misunderstanding. For a moment he struggled against the
overwhelming.
"“Are you in your right senses, Yvonne? Do you understand what I asked"
you? Your first husband is still alive and you saw him to-day?”
"“Yes,” said Yvonne again. “Didn’t you know when you came in?”"
"“I did n’t know,” he repeated almost mechanically."
"The blow crushed him for a while. He stood quite rigid, drawing"
"quick breaths, with his eyes fixed upon her. And she remained still,"
"half-sitting on the edge of the bed, numb with a vague prescience of"
"catastrophe, and a dim, uncomprehended intuition of the earthquake and"
wreck in the man’s soul. The silence grew appalling. She broke it with a
faltering whisper.
“Will you forgive me?”
The poor little commonplace fell in the midst of devastating
emotions--pathetically incongruous.
"“Do you actually ask me such a question, honestly?”"
"“God knows I do,” she replied pitifully."
“And you would have gone on living with me--I not being your husband?”
"“But you are my husband,” cried Yvonne, “nothing could ever alter that.”"
"“But good God! it does alter it,” cried the Canon in a voice of anguish,"
breaking the iron bonds he had placed on his passion. “Neither in the
eyes of God nor of man are you my wife. You have no right to bear my
name. After this hour I have no right to enter this room. Every caress
"I gave you would be sin. Don’t you understand it, child? Don’t you"
"understand that this has brought ruin into our lives, the horror of"
loneliness and separation?”
“Separation?” said Yvonne.
She rose slowly from her seat on the bed and stared at him aghast.
The twilight in the room deepened; the shadow of a wall opposite the
window fell darker. Their faces and Yvonne’s bare neck and arms gleamed
white in the gloom. They had spoken with many silences; for how long
neither knew.
"“Yes,” replied the Canon in his harder tones, recovering himself “It"
means all that.”
“I am to go--not to live with you any more?”
“Could you imagine our past relations could continue?”
“What is it?” I asked eagerly.
"“A burglar’s microphone,” he answered, hastily looking over the"
contents of the safe. “The microphone is now used by burglars for
"picking combination locks. When you turn the lock, a slight sound is"
made when the proper number comes opposite the working point. It can be
"heard sometimes by a sensitive ear, although it is imperceptible to"
most persons. But by using a microphone it is an easy matter to hear
the sounds which allow of opening the lock.”
He had taken a yellow chamois bag out of the safe and opened it.
Inside sparkled the famous Moulton diamonds. He held them up—in all
their wicked brilliancy. No one spoke.
"Then he took another yellow bag, more dirty and worn than the first. As"
"he opened it, Mrs. Moulton could restrain herself no longer."
“The replica!” she cried. “The replica!”
"Without a word, Craig handed the real necklace to her. Then he slipped"
the paste jewels into the newer of the bags and restored both it and
"the empty one to their places, banged shut the door of the safe, and"
replaced the wooden screen.
"“Quick!” he said to her, “you have still a minute to get away."
Hurry—anywhere—away—only away!”
"The look of gratitude that came over her face, as she understood the"
full meaning of it was such as I had never seen before.
Lavender pulled up alongside of the _Arabella_ and deliberately made
the boat fast.
"""We got to act as though we haven't found the knife, y'see,"" he warned."
"""As though we were going just swimming."""
In her eagerness to board the _Arabella_ Sidney stumbled. Lavender had
to clutch her to keep her from tumbling into the water.
"""Oh!"" They both cried in one sound as they clambered to the deck--for"
the knife was gone!
"""Well, _that_ means they'd been on the _Arabella_. Jed Starrow dropped"
"that knife and he missed it and came back to look for it!"""
"""Lav, I believe they've hidden their treasure on the _Arabella_!"""
Sidney still reverted to the more romantic terms of buccaneering.
"""Let's look for it now!"""
"""With 'em watching maybe from the _Puritan_? I guess not. We got to go"
"ahead and swim the way we always do, Sid. Don't let's even appear to be"
"talking about anything. Come on, I'll beat you in!"""
For the space of the few minutes while the water closed about her with
delicious coolness Sidney forgot everything in an intoxication of
delight. Presently she came back to the _Arabella_ and climbed aboard
"with a sigh of utter content. ""Thank goodness _I_ haven't any"
"complexes,"" she laughed, shaking the salt drops from her bobbed head."
"""And now what?"""
Lavender pulled on the light sweater he had worn over his bathing suit.
"“What kind of a lady was Miss Sprowls—in looks, I mean?”"
"“Why, black-haired, sir, short, and stout, with a comical face. They"
left a week ago Tuesday.”
“And before they occupied it?”
"“Why, there was a single gentleman connected with the draying business."
He left owing me a week. Before him was Missis Crowder and her two
"children, that stayed four months; and back of them was old Mr. Doyle,"
whose sons paid for him. He kept the room six months. That goes back a
"year, sir, and further I do not remember.”"
He thanked her and crept back to his room. The room was dead. The
essence that had vivified it was gone. The perfume of mignonette had
"departed. In its place was the old, stale odour of mouldy house"
"furniture, of atmosphere in storage."
"The ebbing of his hope drained his faith. He sat staring at the yellow,"
singing gaslight. Soon he walked to the bed and began to tear the
sheets into strips. With the blade of his knife he drove them tightly
into every crevice around windows and door. When all was snug and taut
"he turned out the light, turned the gas full on again and laid himself"
gratefully upon the bed.
It was Mrs. McCool’s night to go with the can for beer. So she fetched
it and sat with Mrs. Purdy in one of those subterranean retreats where
house-keepers foregather and the worm dieth seldom.
"“I rented out my third floor, back, this evening,” said Mrs. Purdy,"
almost a cry for help. She was growing old and soured and worn by
"perpetual conjugal wranglings. John, her kinsman, counted for a great"
deal in a life none too rich. John and Stella were nearest to her in the
"world--first Stella, naturally, then John. To the woman of over fifty"
the man of under thirty is still a boy. For many years she had nursed
the two together in her heart. And now he was going from her. What
"would she, what would Stella, do without him? Her husband's direct"
interpellation aroused her from her reverie.
"“Julia, what was the name of the chap we met in St. Kitts who had been"
sheep-farming in Queensland?”
They had sailed away from St. Kitts in 1878. Lady Blount reminded
him tartly of the fact while professing her oblivion of the man from
Queensland. They sparred for a few moments. Then she rose wearily and
said she was going to bed. Sir Oliver looked at his watch.
“Nearly twelve. Time for us all to go.”
"“As soon as I' ve written my morning letter to Stellamaris,” said"
Herold.
"“I must write, too,” said Risca."
For it was a rule of the house that every visitor should write
"Stellamaris a note overnight, to be delivered into her hands the first"
thing in the morning. The origin of the rule was wrapped in the mists of
history.
So John Risca sat down at Sir Oliver's study-table in order to indite
his letter to Stellamaris. But for a long time he stared at the white
"paper. He, the practised journalist, who could dash off his thousand"
worth while to add that the next suite was his own.
"""A thousand pardons,"" repeated M. Dubois, very penitently. ""I am too"
stupid! But mademoiselle will perhaps be so gracious as to forgive me
"this time."""
"He bowed to Sallie again and to Slyne, and disappeared, sharply scanning"
the latter's face to the last.
"""Who's that son of a sea-cook?"" snapped Captain Dove, and Mr. Jobling"
looked wanly up out of one eye.
"""A French detective,"" Slyne answered reflectively. But Sallie felt sure"
"that he was afraid of M. Dubois, and wondered why."
"""Well, he has nothing against me that I'm aware of,"" the old man"
"declared. ""And now--what about this wire? Does it mean that some other"
fellow has scooped the pool--and that I've had all my trouble for
"nothing, eh?"" He clenched his fist again and shook it in the lawyer's"
face.
"""No, no,"" gasped Mr. Jobling. ""Don't be so hasty. It makes no difference"
"at all, now that we have Lady Josceline with us. I told you that the"
"American, Carthew, is of no account against her--and how he has ever"
"cropped up again I can't conceive. In any case--"""
"""In any case, you'd better be off to your room and ring for a bit of"
"beefsteak to doctor that eye with,"" Slyne interposed in a tone of"
intense annoyance.
"""And I wish to goodness, Dove!"" he added savagely, ""that you would"
"behave a little more like a reasonable human being and less--"""
"""I do not speak of these men, I am thinking of Judas Petunikoff, who is"
"one of them...."""
"""And you say you have nothing to do with them?"" asks the teacher,"
quietly.
"""But do you think that I do not live?  Aha!  I do live, but I suppose I"
ought not to be angry at the fact that life is desecrated and robbed of
"all freedom by these men."""
"""And they dare to laugh at the kindly anger of the Captain, a man"
"living in retirement?"" says Abyedok, teasingly."
"""Very well!  I agree with you that I am foolish.  Being a creature who"
"was once a man, I ought to blot out from my heart all those feelings"
"that once were mine.  You may be right, but then how could I or any of"
"you defend ourselves if we did away with all these feelings?"""
"""Now then, you are talking sense,"" says the teacher, encouragingly."
"""We want other feelings and other views on life.... We want something"
"new ... because we ourselves are a novelty in this life...."""
"""Doubtless this is most important for us,"" remarks the teacher."
"""Why?"" asks Kanets.  ""Is it not all the same whatever we say or think?"
"We have not got long to live ...  I am forty, you are fifty ... there"
"is no one among us younger than thirty, and even at twenty one cannot"
"live such a life long."""
"""And what kind of novelty are we?"" asked Abyedok, mockingly."
"The boys remained perfectly silent, then, and listened. There seemed to"
"be several men in the chamber below, and two were talking in angry"
"tones. There were plenty of torches below, too, for the red flare and"
the stink of them came into the boys’ hiding place by way of the
fire-niche below. This is what the boys heard:
"“You can see for yourself, Huga,” a voice which Ned recognized as that"
"of Toombs, was saying, “that the boy is not here.”"
“But I am certain I heard footsteps running in this direction when I
stood in the darkness before you men came in!” Huga answered. “He must
be in this chamber somewhere.”
“Look for yourself!” Toombs advised crossly.
“Isn’t there some hiding place in the walls?” asked Huga.
"Ned nudged Jimmie as they heard this, and both moved farther back in the"
hiding place. It will be understood how intently they listened for the
next sentence.
"“You ought to know that,” Toombs answered; “you are supposed to know all"
"about this old mission, while I am fresh from Wall street.”"
“I have never heard of any secret passage or room in this part of the
"excavation,” the half-breed replied."
“Then stop arguing that the boy is here!” roared Toombs.
"Huga made no reply, but the boys heard him poking about in the"
fireplace. Presently a light flashed into the chimney.
"“We might begin,” replied John, “with more elementary accomplishments.”"
"“I could teach her botany,” said Miss Lindon, pensively. “I got first"
"prize for it at school. I still have the book in a cupboard, and I"
could read it up. And I'm so glad I have kept my two volumes of pressed
"flowers. It's quite easy to learn, I assure you.”"
"“I'm afraid, my dear,” said John, “you 'll first have to teach her to"
"eat and drink like a Christian, and blow her nose, and keep her face"
clean.”
"“Ah, that reminds me. My head's in a maze, and I can't think of"
"everything at once, like some clever people. What kind of soap do"
"gentlemen use? I 'll have to know, so as to supply you with what you"
like.”
"“Any old stuff that will make a lather,” said John, rising."
"“But some soaps are so bad for the skin,” she objected anxiously."
“Vitriol would n't hurt my rhinoceros hide.”
"He laughed, and held out his hand. Further discussion was useless."
Miss Lindon accompanied him to the front gate and watched him stride
down the perky terrace until he disappeared round the corner. Then she
"went slowly into the house and uncovered the canary, who blinked at her"
"in oblique sullenness, and did not respond to her friendly “cheep” and"
the scratching of her finger against the rails of his cage. She turned
"to Dandy, who, snoring loud, was equally unresponsive. Feeling lonely"
"and upset, she rang the bell."
Suddenly a postmark on one of the letters on the little table at her
elbow caught her eye. Provincetown. Trude caught it up apprehensively.
That letter might be from their Cousin Achsa! She turned it over and
"over, wishing she might open it."
"""Good morning, my dear! I get up with the birds myself and find that"
"you're up before me!"""
"Trude laughed, to cover her anxiety. ""I told Jonathan I'd inspect his"
"new beds this morning."""
"""There, didn't I say you were supplanting me in Jonathan's esteem? But"
he only wants you to admire them and smile at him. He knows you know
"nothing about gardens, even though you are a very wise young woman! Ah,"
"the mail--is there anything there worth looking at before breakfast?"""
"""Two cards, three advertising envelopes and--and two personal letters."""
"Trude held out the two letters, her heart beating in her throat."
Mrs. White glanced at them indifferently. She turned one as though to
"tear open the envelope, then stopped to play with Mitie. Next she gave"
her attention to Pepper who appeared in the door to summon her to
breakfast. And all the time Trude's eyes were beseeching her to open
them--to open _one_ of them quickly.
Trude followed her into the breakfast room and sat down across from
her. After she had eaten her fruit Mrs. White took up the envelope that
was postmarked Provincetown and studied it while Trude waited.
"""Why, that's from Laura Craig--a cousin of mine. I remember now she"
said she was going to study in a summer school on Cape Cod. I hope the
“Is this the Velázquez portrait?” asked Cæsar.
“This is it.”
Cæsar looked at it carefully. “That man had eaten and drunk well before
"his portrait was painted,” said Cæsar; “his face is congested.”"
"“It is extraordinary!” exclaimed Cortés. “It is something to see, the"
"way this is done. What boldness! Everything is red, the cape, the cap,"
the curtains in the background.... What a man!”
"The German aired his opinions in his own language, and took out a"
notebook and pencil and wrote some notes.
"“What sort of man was this?” asked Cæsar, whom the technical side of"
"painting did not preoccupy, as it did Cortés."
"“They say he was a dull man, who lived under a woman’s domination.”"
"“The great thing is,” murmured Cæsar, “how the painter has left him"
"here alive. It seems as if we had come in here to salute him, and he"
was waiting for us to speak. Those clear eyes are questioning us. It is
curious.”
"“Not curious,” exclaimed Cortés, “but admirable.”"
“For me it is more curious than admirable. There is something brutal in
"this Pope; through his grey beard, which is so thin, you can see his"
"projecting chin. The good gentleman was of a marked prognathism, a type"
"of degeneration, indifference, intellectual torpor, and nevertheless, he"
"reached the top. Perhaps in the Church it’s the same as in water, only"
corks float.”
"""He isn't even thinking of coming, the wretch! ..."""
"""That means that he does not love me!"" sang Deacon Taras, leaning his"
chin on his hand and casting a humorous glance towards the mountain.
At last Petunikoff appeared.  He came in a respectable cart with his
"son playing the role of groom.  The latter was a red-checked,"
"nice-looking youngster, in a long square-cut overcoat.  He wore smoked"
"eyeglasses.  They tied the horse to an adjoining tree, the son took the"
"measuring instrument out of his pocket and gave it to his father, and"
they began to measure the ground.  Both were silent and worried.
"""Aha!"" shouted the Captain, gleefully."
All those who were in the dosshouse at the moment came out to look at
them and expressed themselves loudly and freely in reference to the
matter.
"""What does the habit of thieving mean?  A man may sometimes make a big"
"mistake when he steals, standing to lose more than he gets,"" said the"
"Captain, causing much laughter among his staff and eliciting various"
murmurs of assent.
"""Take care, you devil!"" shouted Petunikoff, ""lest I have you in the"
"police court for your words!"""
"""You can do nothing to me without witnesses ...  Your son cannot give"
"evidence on your side"" ... the Captain warned him."
"""Look out all the same, you old wretch, you may be found guilty too!"""
"And Petunikoff shook his fist at him. His son, deeply engrossed in his"
"half the listeners, had known the lady as Mrs. Medland."
"""No,"" said Mr. Medland; ""I lost sight of him."""
"""You did not hear from--from any one about him?"""
"""No."""
He gave the dates when he had last seen Benyon in old days. Asked
whether he had communicated with him between that date and the dead
"man's reappearance, he answered,"
"""Once, about four years ago. I wrote to tell him of that lady's death,"""
"and he pointed again to the picture, and went on to tell the details of"
Benyon's subsequent application to him for a post under Government.
"""You refused it?"" he was asked."
"""Yes, I refused it. I spoke to him once again, when we met on a social"
occasion. We had a sort of dispute then. I never saw him again to speak
"to."""
"""It was all done,"" said Mr. Duncombe, describing the scene, ""in a"
repressed way that was very effective--to a house that knew the
circumstances most effective. And the other fellow--Kilshaw--he gave
"some sport too. The coroner (they told me he was one of Medland's men,"
and I noticed he spared Medland all he could) was inclined to be a bit
"down on Kilshaw. Kilshaw was cool and handy in his answers, but, Lord"
love you! his game came out pretty plain. A monkey! You don't give a man
"a monkey unless there's value received! So people saw, and Mr. Kilshaw"
looked a bit uncomfortable when he caught Medland's eye. He looked at
"him like that,"" and Mr. Duncombe assumed the finest wronged-hero glance"
Before Peters could reply the red-haired man took a single step forward
and faced Bob.
"“I can tell you in two shakes of a lamb’s tail,” he snapped viciously."
"“This river hog o’ yours thinks he kin play the devil with my boom, but"
he’s got another guess comin’. I own this land an’ that sawmill. I got a
right to run my booms out in the river same as anybody else. I ain’t
"lookin’ for trouble, but the first man as tries any monkey business"
"wants to look out, that’s all.”"
"Bainbridge raised his eyebrows, and let his gaze wander leisurely from"
the man’s head to his heels with an expression which brought an added
touch of color to the already flushed cheeks.
“Indeed!” he drawled. “Who are you?”
“Who be I?” retorted the other angrily. “Humph! I don’t see that it
"makes no difference, but my name’s Joyce--John Joyce. An’ I ain’t the"
"kind as backs down an’ takes water, believe me!”"
A singularly irritating smile curved the corners of Bob’s lips. His
"unruffled composure served, as he hoped it might, to increase the rage"
of Mr. Joyce.
“Do you realize that you’re obstructing navigation?” he inquired
suavely.
"“I don’t admit it,” snapped Joyce. “There’s plenty of room for your"
"drive to git past if you had a gang that knew their business, instead of"
a lot o’ greenhorns.”
"“I dare say you could give us all points,” Bainbridge murmured smoothly,"
"""With gratitude,"
"""Your friend,"
"""LE BLANC."""
"I sought Frances, and when I told her the substance of George's letter,"
she was almost wild with joy.
"""Am I willing to try?"" she exclaimed, laughing while tears were hanging"
"in her eyes. ""I am not only willing to try, but am determined to succeed."
"Ay, I'd sell England itself in the same cause. Of all the men I have ever"
"known, this king of ours is the greatest dupe. Since the return of the"
"court to Whitehall, he has been growing more importunate every day. He"
"seems to have lost what little wits he had, and does and says the"
"silliest things one can imagine."""
"""And you do not fear attempting to lead him on to sell Dunkirk? You do"
"not fear going too near the precipice?"" I asked, wishing to weigh her"
self-confidence more by the manner of her reply than by her words.
"She laughed and answered: ""There is no precipice, cousin Ned; nothing to"
"fear save kidnapping, and I am always guarded against that danger;"
"nothing to do of which I need feel ashamed, save the acting of a lie, and"
"surely one may lie to the father of lies without sin."""
"""But the lie may be recognized,"" I suggested, ""if one be too bold about"
"it."""
"""My lie will go little beyond a smile or two. The king's vanity will do"
"the rest. He will make himself believe that I mean more than I say."""
"""To please me."""
Mr. Wagge's readjusted glance stopped in confusion at her waist. He
"answered, in a voice that he strove to make bland:"
"""If you put it in that way, I don't reelly know 'ow to refuse; but it"
"must be quite between you and me--I can't withdraw my attitude."""
Gyp murmured:
"""No, of course.  Thank you so much; and you'll let me know about"
"everything later.  I mustn't take up your time now.""  And she held out"
her hand.
Mr. Wagge took it in a lingering manner.
"""Well, I HAVE an appointment,"" he said; ""a gentleman at Campden Hill.  He"
"starts at twelve.  I'm never late.  GOOD-morning."""
"When she had watched his square, black figure pass through the outer"
"gate, busily rebuttoning those shining black gloves, she went upstairs"
and washed her face and hands.
"For several days, Fiorsen wavered; but his collapse had come just in"
"time, and with every hour the danger lessened.  At the end of a fortnight"
"of a perfectly white life, there remained nothing to do in the words of"
"the doctor but ""to avoid all recurrence of the predisposing causes, and"
"shove in sea air!""  Gyp had locked up all brandy--and violins; she could"
control him so long as he was tamed by his own weakness.  But she passed
"some very bitter hours before she sent for her baby, Betty, and the dogs,"
and definitely took up life in her little house again.  His debts had
squarely in the stomach.
"With a startled, disbelieving look the Japanese stumbled backward,"
crashing over a large chair positioned next to the table. The other
"_kobun_ instantly reached for his holstered Llama, but by then Kenji"
"Nogami had moved, seizing him and momentarily pinning his arms with a"
powerful embrace.
"For her own part, Eva had lunged for Vera and her purse, to neutralize"
"the Walther she carried. Comrade Karanova, however, had already"
"anticipated everything. She whisked back the purse, then plunged her"
"hand in. What she withdrew, though, was not a pistol but a shiny"
cylindrical object made of glass.
"It was three against three, a snapshot of desperation."
"We've got a chance, Vance thought. Keep him down. And get the Llama."
"As the _kobun_ tried to rise, gasping, Vance threw himself over the"
"upturned chair, reaching to pin the man's arms. With a bear-like"
"embrace he had him, the body small and muscular in his arms. Out of the"
corner of his eye he saw Kenji Nogami still grappling with the other
"_kobun_. The computer now lay on the floor, open and askew."
"Where's Eva? He tried to turn and look for her, but there was no sound"
to guide him. Then the _kobun_ wrenched free one arm and brought a fist
"against the side of his face, diverting him back to matters at hand."
Hold him down. Just get the gun.
"He tried to crush his larger frame against the other's slim body,"
forcing the air out of him. Focus.
"""Well, here goes for food!"" he said, as though he were going to require"
all his energy for the task of eating.
Why had she written? There was nothing to prevent her speaking to him. He
"had, after all, been sitting on the doorstep when she emerged from her"
room and passed him. Had she foreseen that the good comedian could not
"contain himself, but would surely let a third person into the secret?"
"Why probe or question further? The actor did not eat much, but he looked"
"very happy. So the note must have said yes, must have been a promise;"
perhaps she would not tantalize him further.
XXV
"A few days later, they were going to leave. They would travel together,"
and that would be the end.
"I might have pitied them both, for though life is good, life is stern. One"
"result at any rate was accomplished. She had not sent for him in vain, nor"
had he come in vain.
That was the end of the act. But there were more acts to come--many more.
"She had lost much: having been ravished, she gave herself away; why be"
"niggardly now? And this is the destiny of her type, that they lose"
"increasingly much, retaining ever less; what need to hold back now? The"
ground has been completely shifted: from half-measures to the immolation
"“I don’t understand,” she began feebly. And then the darkness fell upon"
"her, and her limbs relaxed. She swayed sideways and would have fallen,"
but he caught her in his arms and laid her on the couch.
"“Thank you,” she murmured faintly."
"She hid her face in her hands and remained, crouched up, quite still, in"
"a stupor of misery. The Canon stood over her helplessly, unable to find"
a word of comfort.
The sight of her prostration did not move him. He had been wounded to
"the very depths of his being. His pride, his honour, his dignity were"
lacerated in their vitals. He burned with the sense of unpardonable
wrong.
"“It is self-evident,” he said at last, “that we must part. Our remaining"
together would be a sin against God and an outrage upon Society.”
"She rased herself wearily, with one hand on the couch, and shook her"
head slowly.
“Such things are beyond me. No one will ever know.”
"“There is One who will always know, Yvonne.”"
"She pondered over the saying, as far as her tired, bewildered brain"
allowed. It conveyed very little meaning to her. Theology had not
altered her child-like conception of the benevolence of the Creator.
After a long time she was able to disentangle an idea from the
confusion.
"for herself, but with fear for me. No one can reassure her. In fact it"
was as much for her sake as anyone’s that I sent for you. Reginald has
"tried to trace the thing down himself, but has not succeeded.”"
She paused. The door opened and Reginald Blake entered. He was a young
"fellow, self confident and no doubt very efficient at the new dances,"
"though scarcely fitted to rub elbows with a cold world which, outside"
"of his own immediate circle, knew not the name of Blake. He stood for a"
moment regarding us through the smoke of his cigarette.
"“Tell me just what you have done,” asked Kennedy of him as his mother"
"introduced him, although he had done the talking for her over the"
telephone.
"“Done?” he drawled. “Why, as soon as mother told me of the letter, I"
"left an envelope up at the Prince Henry, as it directed.”"
“With the money?” put in Craig quickly.
"“Oh, no—just as a decoy.”"
“Yes. What happened?”
"“Well, I waited around a long time. It was far along in the day when a"
woman appeared at the desk. I had instructed the clerk to be on the
watch for anyone who asked for mail addressed to a Dr. Hopf. The clerk
slammed the register. That was the signal. I moved up closer.”
“What did she look like?” asked Kennedy keenly.
"“I couldn’t see her face. But she was beautifully dressed, with a long"
"light flowing linen duster, a veil that hid her features and on her"
“And do you like Rome; eh?”
"“I should say so! At first, I didn’t, I must admit. It was a"
disappointment to me. I had dreamed so much about Rome!” and Kennedy
talked of the books and guides he had read about the Eternal City.
"“I must admit that I had never dreamed about Rome,” said Cæsar. “And"
you boast of that?” asked Laura.
"“No, I don’t boast of it, I merely state it. I understand how agreeable"
it is to know things. Cæsar died here! Cicero made speeches here! Saint
Peter stumbled over this stone! It is fine! But not knowing things
is also very comfortable. I am rather like a barbarian walking
indifferently among monuments he knows nothing about.”
“Doesn’t such an idea make you ashamed?”
"“No, why? It would be a bother to me to know a lot of things offhand. To"
"pass by a mountain and know how it was thrown up, what it is composed"
"of, what its flora and fauna are; to get to a town and know its history"
in detail.... What things to be interested in! It’s tiresome! I hate
"history too much. I far prefer to be ignorant of everything, and"
"especially the past, and from time to time to offer myself a capricious,"
arbitrary explanation.”
"“But I think that knowing things not only is not tiresome,” said"
"Kennedy, “but is a great satisfaction.”"
“You think even learning things is a satisfaction?”
“Thousands of years ago one could know things almost without learning
"them; nowadays in order to know, one has to learn. That is natural and"
"stood a pile of grips, stacked up, packed, and undisturbed."
Winters who had been studying the room while we got our bearings picked
up a queer-looking revolver from the floor. As he held it up I could
see that along the top of the barrel was a long cylinder with a ratchet
or catch at the butt end. He turned it over and over carefully.
"“By George,” he muttered, “it has been fired off.”"
Kennedy glanced more minutely at the body. There was not a mark on it.
I stared about vacantly at the place where Winters had picked the thing
up.
"“Look,” I cried, my eye catching a little hole in the baseboard of the"
woodwork near it.
"“It must have fallen and exploded on the floor,” remarked Kennedy. “Let"
"me see it, Winters.”"
Craig held it at arm’s length and pulled the catch. Instead of an
"explosion, there came a cone of light from the top of the gun. As"
"Kennedy moved it over the wall, I saw in the center of the circle of"
light a dark spot.
"“A new invention,” Craig explained. “All you need to do is to move it"
so that little dark spot falls directly on an object. Pull the
trigger—the bullet strikes the dark spot. Even a nervous and unskilled
marksman becomes a good shot in the dark. He can even shoot from behind
the protection of something—and hit accurately.”
It was too much for me. I could only stand and watch Kennedy as he
deftly bent over Schloss again and placed a piece of chemically
"he had reached the corner house, their house. The carriage gates were"
pushed back; there were fresh marks of wheels on the drive. And then he
"faced the big white-painted house, with its wide-open windows, its"
"tulle curtains floating outwards, its blue jars of hyacinths on the"
broad sills. On either side of the carriage porch their
"hydrangeas—famous in the town—were coming into flower; the pinkish,"
bluish masses of flower lay like light among the spreading leaves. And
"somehow, it seemed to old Mr. Neave that the house and the flowers, and"
"even the fresh marks on the drive, were saying, “There is young life"
here. There are girls—”
"The hall, as always, was dusky with wraps, parasols, gloves, piled on"
"the oak chests. From the music-room sounded the piano, quick, loud and"
impatient. Through the drawing-room door that was ajar voices floated.
"“And were there ices?” came from Charlotte. Then the creak, creak of"
her rocker.
"“Ices!” cried Ethel. “My dear mother, you never saw such ices. Only two"
"kinds. And one a common little strawberry shop ice, in a sopping wet"
frill.”
"“The food altogether was too appalling,” came from Marion."
"“Still, it’s rather early for ices,” said Charlotte easily."
"“But why, if one has them at all....” began Ethel."
"“Oh, quite so, darling,” crooned Charlotte."
"Suddenly the music-room door opened and Lola dashed out. She started,"
"she nearly screamed, at the sight of old Mr. Neave."
"“You’ve been under arrest for ten minutes, ‘Silky’ Bob. Chicago thinks"
you may have dropped over our way and wires us she wants to have a chat
"with you. Going quietly, are you? That’s sensible. Now, before we go on"
to the station here’s a note I was asked to hand you. You may read it
here at the window. It’s from Patrolman Wells.”
The man from the West unfolded the little piece of paper handed him.
"His hand was steady when he began to read, but it trembled a little by"
the time he had finished. The note was rather short.
_Bob: I was at the appointed place on time. When you struck the match
to light your cigar I saw it was the face of the man wanted in Chicago.
"Somehow I couldn’t do it myself, so I went around and got a plain"
clothes man to do the job.
JIMMY._
LOST ON DRESS PARADE
Mr. Towers Chandler was pressing his evening suit in his hall bedroom.
One iron was heating on a small gas stove; the other was being pushed
vigorously back and forth to make the desirable crease that would be
seen later on extending in straight lines from Mr. Chandler’s patent
leather shoes to the edge of his low-cut vest. So much of the hero’s
toilet may be intrusted to our confidence. The remainder may be guessed
by those whom genteel poverty has driven to ignoble expedient. Our next
view of him shall be as he descends the steps of his lodging-house
"""So you're here at last----!"" then with a little gasp drew back, facing"
me in the most entrancing attitude of bewilderment.
It was the girl who had left that ball of paper!
"The sea, always my friend, at this moment did a rather decent thing; it"
gave the yacht a firm but gentle lurch and sent us into each other's
arms. Perhaps nothing else in all the world of chances could so
"effectively have broken the ice between us, for we were laughing as I"
"helped her back to the couch; and, as our eyes met, again we laughed."
"""I didn't know,"" she said, ""that Father brought a guest aboard last"
"night!"""
"""Awkward of him, wasn't it?"" I stammered, sparring for time."
"""One is apt to be awkward in weather like this,"" she graciously"
admitted.
"""You don't know how profoundly aware I am of--of how terribly true that"
"is,"" I stumbled along. ""Is he on deck?"" For, oh, if I could only get to"
see him five minutes alone!
"""No, he's unusually lazy this morning; but I've called, him, the old"
"dear!"""
"A chill crept up my spine--crept up, crept down, and then criss-crossed."
But she must know of her mistake before we had gone so far that putting
me ashore would be a serious inconvenience--for I knew he would put me
"ashore at the nearest point, if not, indeed, set me adrift in an open"
boat. Therefore I suggested:
"“I’m afraid it wouldn’t do much good in case of an attack,” Ned"
suggested. “We’d soon get hungry and thirsty and have to surrender.”
"“Anyway, it’s an all right thing to shoot from!” Jimmie announced. “If"
"you’d seen the way we sweat rolling those rocks, you’d think it was all"
"right, anyway. I wonder where the boys are.”"
"“I was thinking more about the boys than about the barricade,” Ned"
admitted. “Were they all here when you left?”
"“All sitting in front of the entrance,” Jimmie replied, “except Gilroy,"
and he was asleep on a pile of blankets in the cave.”
"“He may be there yet,” suggested Ned. “Suppose we go and see.”"
"Jimmie made his way through the narrow entrance, found a searchlight,"
and turned a round circle of flame on a great heap of blankets in a back
corner. There was no one in the cave at all save only himself.
"Before returning to report to Ned, the hungry boy seized a plate of corn"
pones and a can of tinned beans from the provision chest.
"“Look here, Ned,” he said in a moment, appearing before his chum with"
"his mouth full of beans, “the appetite of our midnight visitor seems to"
be for confidential clerks as well as for bread. Someone has stolen
"Gilroy! Anyway, he’s not in the cave!”"
"“He may have gone away with the boys,” suggested Ned."
"“He wasn’t thinking of going away with the boys when I left,” Jimmie"
"answered. “He was telling how much he liked New York, and how he’d like"
"this way, Mr. Gilroy,” he went on, “the bears out here are hungry for"
"fat clerks from Wall street. I’ve heard they make stews of ’em,” he"
concluded.
Gilroy now arose to his feet and stood gazing into the thicket in the
direction of the bear’s disappearance. Jimmie’s assertion that bruin
would hit the Arctic circle early the next morning seemed to give him
"great comfort. As the distance between the bear and himself increased,"
he grew braver and began throwing out his chest.
"“What a chance that was for me to kill a bear!” he began, boastfully,"
"“If I’d only had a gun with me, I might have had a fine rug made out of"
his hide! It would have been fine to show my friends.”
“Sure it would!” declared Jimmie. “I’m glad you didn’t remember that you
had a gun in your pocket. The bears out here are pretty sensitive about
"being shot at. If you’d blazed away at that cub, and hadn’t shot him"
"dead in his tracks the first time, he would have eaten you.”"
Gilroy put his hand to his pistol pocket and a look of pretended
amazement came over his fat face.
"“Upon my word!” he said, “I thought I left my gun in the bunk!”"
"“After this,” Ned advised, “always keep your gun in sight when you go"
"into the forest. Suppose there had been no tree to climb, what then?”"
"“I should have grappled with him, sir!” exclaimed Gilroy. “I certainly"
should have grappled with him.”
"“You would have had to catch him first,” Jimmie grinned."
cold fury:
"""You better stop that laughin', Jack Rance, or I'll send you to finish"
"it in some place where things ain't so funny."""
Something in the Girl's altered tone so struck the Sheriff that he
"obeyed her. He said nothing, but on his lips were the words, ""By Heaven,"
"the Girl means it!"" and his eyes showed a smouldering admiration."
"""He doesn't hear you,--he's out of it. But me--me--I hear you--I ain't"
"out of it,"" the Girl went on in compelling tones. ""You're a gambler; he"
"was, too; well, so am I."" She crossed deliberately to the bureau, and"
"laid her pistol away in the drawer, Rance meanwhile eyeing her with"
"puzzled interest. Returning, she went on, incisively as a whip lash:"
"""I live on chance money, drink money, card money, saloon money. We're"
"gamblers,--we're all gamblers!"" She paused, an odd expression coming"
"over her face,--an expression that baffled Rance's power to read."
"Presently she resumed: ""Now, you asked me to-night if my answer was"
"final,--well, here's your chance. I'll play you the game,--straight"
"poker. It's two out o' three for me. Hatin' the sight o' you, it's the"
"nearest chance you'll ever get for me."""
"""Do you mean--"" began Rance, his hands resting on the table, his"
hawk-like glance burning into her very thoughts.
"""Yes, with a wife in Noo Orleans all right,"" she interrupted him"
"feverishly. ""If you're lucky,--you'll git 'im an' me. But if you"
"lose,--this man settin' between us is mine--mine to do with as I please,"
"an' you shut up an' lose like a gentleman."""
"""You must be crazy about him!"" The words seemed wrung from the Sheriff"
against his will.
"presence, especially as I read he's indisposed, but really I hardly know"
how to bear the situation.  I can't bring myself to think of money in
"relation to that matter; all the same, it's a serious loss to my"
"daughter, very serious loss.  I've got my family pride to think of.  My"
"daughter's name, well--it's my own; and, though I say it, I'm"
"respected--a regular attendant--I think I told you. Sometimes, I assure"
"you, I feel I can't control myself, and it's only that--and you, if I may"
"say so, that keeps me in check."""
"During this speech, his black-gloved hands were clenching and"
"unclenching, and he shifted his broad, shining boots.  Gyp gazed at them,"
not daring to look up at his eyes thus turning and turning from
"Christianity to shekels, from his honour to the world, from his anger to"
herself.  And she said:
"""Please let me do what I ask, Mr. Wagge.  I should be so unhappy if I"
"mightn't do that little something."""
Mr. Wagge blew his nose.
"""It's a delicate matter,"" he said.  ""I don't know where my duty lays.  I"
"don't, reelly."""
Gyp looked up then.
"""The great thing is to save Daisy suffering, isn't it?"""
"Mr. Wagge's face wore for a moment an expression of affront, as if from"
the thought: 'Sufferin'!  You must leave that to her father!' Then it
"wavered; the curious, furtive warmth of the attracted male came for a"
"moment into his little eyes; he averted them, and coughed.  Gyp said"
softly:
to pound his ear for about three days and nights.”
"“Anyway,” Ned decided, “we’ll wait here a little while and see if they"
"don’t return. In the meantime, you can get yourself something to eat.”"
“Don’t you call this something to eat?” asked Jimmie.
“One poor little can of beans and one poor little plate of corn pones
"won’t make much of an impression on your appetite,” Ned laughed. “What"
"you need is one of those neat little bear steaks, about as large as a"
warming pan. You’ll have plenty of time in which to cook it.”
"“And that means that I can cook one for you, too?” asked Jimmie."
"“Why, of course you can!” returned Ned."
“I’d like to cook one for the Boy Scout who got us both into such
"trouble,” Jimmie declared. “I’d put poison on it!”"
"“Now, don’t you be too severe on that Boy Scout,” Ned advised."
"“According to your own story, he warned you and Frank in the thicket,"
"and I know very well that he wanted to tell me something, but didn’t"
dare do it.”
"“Well, here’s another thing,” Jimmie explained. “When I went out to look"
"for you, I gave the ‘help’ smoke signal from the top of a granite rock"
in the pines. In five minutes after the columns of smoke became large
"enough to be seen at a distance, the signal was answered from the north,"
"it seemed to me from the vicinity of the old mission. Now, of course,"
you didn’t send out that signal.”
"“I rather think not,” smiled Ned."
"“Thanks,” said Mrs. Winstanley, and then, suddenly looking at Yvonne--"
"“Mercy, my dear! How white you are!”"
"“There’s nothing the matter with me,” said Yvonne, trying to smile."
"“It’s past our _déjeuner_ hour,” said the Canon, briskly. “You want some"
food.”
"“Perhaps I do,” said Yvonne."
"She went with the Canon on to the _digue_, and walked along the shady"
"side, by the hotels, past the gay terraces thronged with lunching"
guests. But all the glamour had gone from the place. An hour had changed
it. And that hour seemed a black abyss separating her from happiness.
"An hour ago she had looked upon this kind, grave man who walked by"
her side as her husband. Now what was he to her? She shrank from the
"thought, terrified, and came nearer to him, touching the flying skirt of"
his coat as if to take strength from him.
"They entered the crowded dining-room, where the _maître d’hôtel_ had"
"reserved them a table. She struggled bravely through part of the meal,"
strove to keep up a conversation. But the strain was too great. Another
"five minutes, she felt, would make her hysterical. She rose, with an"
"excuse to the Canon, and escaped to her room."
There she flung herself down on the bed and buried her face in the cool
pillows. It was a relief to be alone with her fright and dismay. She
"strove to think, but her head was in a whirl. The incidents of the late"
"scene came luridly before her mind, and she shivered with revulsion. A"
rough hand had been laid on the butterfly and brushed the dust from its
"his grotesque body, spoke for him."
"""That,"" he was certainly saying, ""is what will happen to any on your"
"helpless planet who dare oppose the Rogan will!"""
He whipped out a command to the terror-stricken girl. She rose from
her crouching position on the floor; and at length formulated the
Rogan's last order:
"""You will explain the working of the engine that drove your space ship"
"here."""
"Dex laughed. It was a short bark of sound, totally devoid of humor,"
but very full of defiance. Brand thrust his hands into the pockets of
"his tunic, spread his legs apart, and began to whistle."
*       *       *       *       *
A quiver that might have been of anger touched the Rogan leader's
repulsive little mouth. He glared balefully at the uncowed Earthmen
"and spoke again, evidently repeating his command. The two turned their"
backs to him to indicate their refusal to obey.
"At that, the tall leader pointed to Dex. In an instant three of the"
guards had wound their double pairs of arms around his struggling
"body. Brand sprang to help him, but a touch of the mysterious"
discharge from the leader's tube sent him writhing to the floor.
"""It's no use, Brand,"" said Dex steadily. He too had stopped"
"struggling, and now stood quietly in the slimy coils of his captors'"
"arms. ""I might as well go along with them and get it over with. I"
"probably won't see you again. Good luck!"""
rather know that George had gone to Canada than to fear his return to
England under the circumstances.
"""The dastardly king will take his life if he comes,"" she said."
"""I admit the danger,"" I answered, as hopefully as possible, ""but I"
"believe, if George comes, he will be able to take care of himself."""
"""Danger!"" she exclaimed. ""It is certain death! George will find no"
"mercy."""
"""If he is caught,"" I answered. ""But the letter from King Louis will"
convince King Charles that Hamilton is in Canada and will throw our
jealous monarch off his guard. Perhaps Hamilton will be safer than we
"suppose. He speaks French like a Parisian, but, above all, he is cool,"
"calm, and thoughtful in danger. The London merchants will be far more"
"dangerous than the king."""
"""It does seem that we are guilty of treason to our country in thus"
"helping France,"" she said. Then laughingly, ""But I'll go back to the"
"palace at once and begin my task of wheedling the king."" She paused for a"
"moment, then continued hesitatingly, ""Do you suppose it possible that"
"George would doubt me afterwards?"""
"""Impossible,"" I answered, with emphasis that seemed to reassure her."
"""I am doing it for him,"" she continued with a sigh. ""God knows I would"
"do almost anything in the same cause. But I do not know men, and I fear"
it is possible that he will doubt me after I have succeeded. Let us go
"to see Betty. She is restful to me, and always soothes my nerves. But"
"besides, I want to have her help. I'll introduce her to the king--"""
"back and clicked his teeth at the ceiling. ""Think we'd have nested out"
"nicely."""
"I hitched myself up to him and we sat on the bunk, glooming away at"
each other. Then we heard the tramp of feet in the crossway.
Butt swung down and headed for the control compartment in the
nose of the lifeboat. He had his blaster out and was cursing very
"interestingly. I started after him, but he picked me up by the seat"
of my jumper and tossed me toward the door. The Captain came in and
tripped over me.
I got all tangled up in his gold braid and million-mile space buttons.
"When we finally got to our feet and sorted out right, he was breathing"
"very hard. The Captain was a round little man with a plump, golden face"
"and a very scared look on it. He _humphed_ at me, just the way Sis"
"does, and lifted me by the scruff of my neck. The Chief Mate picked me"
up and passed me to the Second Assistant Engineer.
"Sis was there, being held by the purser on one side and the Chief"
"Computer's Mate on the other. Behind them, I could see a flock of"
wide-eyed female passengers.
"""You cowards!"" Sis was raging. ""Letting your Captain face a dangerous"
"outlaw all by himself!"""
"""I dunno, Miss Sparling,"" the Computer's Mate said, scratching the"
"miniature slide-rule insignia on his visor with his free hand. ""The Old"
"Man would've been willing to let it go with a log entry, figuring the"
spaceport paddlefeet could pry out the stowaway when we landed. But you
"had to quote the Mother Anita Law at him, and he's in there doing his"
"duty. He figures the rest of us are family men, too, and there's no"
till the day I can hand you your hundred thousand in cash. Everything's
"fair, square, and above-board now. I'm not asking you to risk anything."
"""And where in the wide world can you expect to do better for yourself!"""
"he argued. ""If you go East you'll get no more for the girl--and look at"
"the expense! You'll be sorry all the rest of your life, too, for I know"
you'd far sooner see her decently settled than sell her to any dog-faced
son-of-a-gun of a mandarin!
"""You can say what you like,"" he concluded, although Captain Dove had"
"said never a word. ""Clean money's pleasanter to spend than dirty, any"
"day. If I had been born wealthy, I'd never have needed to touch a marked"
"card. And now's your chance, too, to pull out of a rotten rut that'll"
"sooner or later land you among the chain-gang."""
"Captain Dove came forth from his cabin, indifferently clad, and eyed"
Slyne with a sarcastic interest which somewhat disconcerted that
homilist.
"""You don't _look_ just like a Band o' Hope!"" said the old man, ""but--"""
"Slyne rose again, and bit his lip, in simulated impatience. ""Oh, all"
"right,"" said he. ""If you're not interested--"""
"Captain Dove scowled at him. ""I'm interested,"" he said grudgingly. ""I'll"
"see this lawyer-fellow of yours whenever you like to bring him aboard,"
"and--if the money's there, you can count me in."""
"""He isn't the sort of lawyer you've been accustomed to, Dove,"" said"
"Slyne. ""You've got to go to him."""
"Captain Dove did his best to out-stare him, but failed."
And he went out and banged the door behind him. He walked the streets
furiously angry with Herold. He had gone to consult him on a baffling
problem. Herold had suggested a maiden aunt as a solution. He had but
"one, his mother's sister. Her name was Gladys. What was a woman of over"
fifty doing with such an idiot name? His Aunt Gladys lived at Croydon
and spent her time solving puzzles and following the newspaper accounts
of the doings of the royal family. She knew nothing. He remembered when
he was a boy at school coming home for the holidays cock-a-whoop at
having won the high jump in the school athletics sports. His Aunt
"Gladys, while professing great interest, had said, “But what I don't"
"understand, dear, is--what do you get on to jump down from?” He had"
"smiled and explained, but he had felt cold in the pit of his stomach. A"
futile lady. His opinion of her had not changed. In these days John was
rather an intolerant fellow.
"Chance willed it, however, that when he reached Fenton Square he found"
a letter which began “My dearest John” and ended “Your loving Aunt
Gladys.” And it was the letter of a very sweet-natured gentlewoman.
"John sat down at his desk to work, but ideas would not come. At last"
"he lit his pipe, threw himself into a chair in front of the fire, and"
"smoked till past midnight, with his heavy brows knitted in a tremendous"
frown.
CHAPTER VI
THE same frown darkened Risca's brow the next day as he waited for
admittance at his Aunt Gladys's door. It was such a futile little door
"on his feet once more, pulling his clothes to rights, we looked at each"
"other. I had no wish to speak to him further, and left him. Besides, he"
was going away soon.
"After this, everything was dull and empty again. I went out alone, aping"
"myself and shouting: ""Bricks for the palace! The calf is much stronger"
"today!"" And when this was done, I did other nothings, and when my money"
"began to run out, I wrote to my publisher, pretending I would soon send"
"him an unbelievably remarkable manuscript. In short, I behaved like a man"
in love. These were the typical symptoms.
And to take the bull by the horns: no doubt you suspect me of dwelling on
the subject of Miss Torsen out of self-interest? In that case I must have
concealed well in these pages that I never think of her except as an
"object, as a theme; turn back the pages and you will see! At my age, one"
"does not fall in love without becoming grotesque, without making even the"
Pharaohs laugh.
*       *       *       *       *
_Finis._
"But there is one thing I cannot finish doing, and that is withdrawing to"
"my room, and sitting alone with the good darkness round me. This, after"
"all, is the last pleasure."
An interlude:
Miss Torsen and her actor are walking this way; I hear their footsteps and
"their voices; but since I am sitting in the dark of the evening, I cannot"
"see them. They stop outside my open window, leaning against it, and the"
"actor says something, asks her to do something she does not want to do,"
(_b_) The wife of a knight or baronet is _Lady_. Whether this title
precedes or follows her forename depends upon whether she had a title
before her marriage.
"That is, if Lady Mary Smith marries Sir John Brown (either knight or"
"baronet), she is _Lady Mary Brown_, also if Hon. Mary Smith marries"
Sir John Brown (knight or baronet) she is _Lady Mary Brown_; but if
"Miss Mary Smith marries Sir John Brown (knight or baronet), she becomes"
"_Mary, Lady Brown_."
"(_c_) A maid of honor retains her _Hon._ after marriage, unless, of"
"course, it is merged into a higher title."
"Thus, if she marries a baronet she is the _Honᵇˡᵉ Lady Brown_; if a"
"peer, the _Lady So and So_. In either case as though she had been a"
peer's daughter.
(_d_) The wife of an earl's (or higher peer's) younger son is never the
_Honᵇˡᵉ Lady_; if she used the _Lady_ before marriage in her own right
"she does not, of course, add anything by such marriage, but the wife"
of a younger son of a lower peer than an earl is _Honᵇˡᵉ Mrs._ (not
"_Lady_)--the younger children of all peers using, of course, the family"
"name, with or without their forenames, according to their rank."
(_e_) If the lady to whom the title _Hon._ belongs in virtue of her
"father's rank marries a commoner, she retains her title, becoming"
"_Hon. Lady_ if she marries a knight or baronet, and _Hon. Mrs._ if her"
husband has no title.
None of these courtesy titles is inherited by the children of those who
"bear them, the third generation of even the highest peer being simply"
"""You do!"""
"""I admit that every circumstance points to--"""
"""Stop! Don't you give me any more o' that Webster Unabridged. You git to"
"cases. If you didn't come here to steal you came to The Polka to rob it,"
"didn't you?"""
"Johnson, his eyes lowered, was forced to admit that such were his"
"intentions, adding swiftly:"
"""But when I knew about you--"" He broke off and took a step towards her."
"""Wait! Wait! Wait where you are! Don't you take a step further or"
"I'll--"" She made a significant gesture towards her bosom, and then,"
"laughing harshly, went on denouncingly: ""A road agent! A road agent!"
"Well, ain't it my luck! Wouldn't anybody know to look at me that a"
"gentleman wouldn't fall my way! A road agent! A road agent!"" And again"
"she laughed bitterly before going on: ""But now you can git--git, you"
"thief, you imposer on a decent woman! I ought to have tol' 'em all, but"
I wa'n't goin' to be the joke o' the world with you behind the curtains
an' me eatin' charlotte rusks an' lemming turnovers an' a-polkyin' with
"a road agent! But now you can git--git, do you hear me?"""
Johnson heard her to the end with bowed head; and so scathing had been
her denunciations of his actions that the fact that pride alone kept her
from breaking down completely escaped his notice. With his eyes still
downcast be said in painful fragments:
"""One word only--only a word and I'm not going to say anything in defence"
of myself. For it's all true--everything is true except that I would
"""Well, show me the girl that would want to go to Heaven alone! I'll sell"
"out the saloon--I'll go anywhere with you, you bet!"""
Johnson bent low over her hand and kissed it. The Girl's straightforward
answer had filled his heart to overflowing with joy.
"""You know what that means, don't you?"" a moment later he asked."
Sudden joy leapt to her blue eyes.
"""Oh, yes,"" she told him with a world of understanding in her voice."
"There was a silence; then she went on reminiscently: ""There's a little"
Spanish Mission church--I pass it 'most every day. I can look in an' see
the light burnin' before the Virgin an' see the saints standin' round
with glassy eyes an' faded satin slippers. An' I often tho't what they'd
"think if I was to walk right in to be made--well, some man's wife. It"
makes your blood like pin-points thinkin' about it. There's somethin'
"kind o' holy about love, ain't they?"""
"Johnson nodded. He had never regarded love in that light before, much"
"less known it. For many moments he stood motionless, a new problem of"
right and wrong throbbing in his bosom.
"At last, it being settled that Johnson was to pass the night in the"
"Girl's cabin, she went over to the bed and, once more, began to make it"
"ready for his occupancy. Meanwhile, Johnson, seated in the barrel rocker"
"before the fire, watched her with a new interest. The Girl had not gone"
"very far with her duties, however, when she suddenly came over to him,"
plumping herself down on the floor at his feet.
"""Say, did you ever ask any other woman to marry you?"" she asked as she"
"Petunikoff and his kind tremble and perspire before me!"""
"""Ah!  You have a courageous tongue!"" jeered Abyedok."
"""Yes ...  You miser!""  And Kuvalda looked at him contemptuously.  ""What"
do you understand?  What do you know?  Are you able to think?  But I
have thought and I have read ... books of which you could not have
"understood one word."""
"""Of course!  One cannot eat soup out of one's hand ... But though you"
"have read and thought, and I have not done that or anything else, we"
"both seem to have got into pretty much the same condition, don't we?"""
"""Go to the Devil!"" shouted Kuvalda.  His conversations with Abyedok"
"always ended thus.  When the teacher was absent his speeches, as a"
"rule, fell on the empty air, and received no attention, and he knew"
"this, but still he could not help speaking.  And now, having quarrelled"
"with his companion, he felt rather deserted; but, still longing for"
"conversation, he turned to Simtsoff with the following question: ""And"
"you, Aleksei Maksimovitch, where will you lay your grey head?"""
"The old man smiled good-humouredly, rubbed his hands, and replied, ""I"
"do not know ...  I will see.  One does not require much, just a little"
"drink."""
"""Plain but honourable fare!"" the Captain said.  Simtsoff was silent,"
"only adding that he would find a place sooner than any of them, because"
"women loved him.  This was true.  The old man had, as a rule, two or"
"three prostitutes, who kept him on their very scant earnings.  They"
"very often beat him, but he took this stoically.  They somehow never"
"beat him too much, probably because they pitied him.  He was a great"
"lover of women, and said they were the cause of all his misfortunes."
"""That's so,"" said the second mate, who had been listening.  ""Now last"
"v'y'ge in the _Battleaxe_, there was a Dago in my watch as come from"
the betwixt and between land where Spain jines France.  And he was
"the Dagoest Dago I ever sailed with.  But I knew the breed, and the"
first time he opens his garlicky mouth I hauled off and hit him.  And
then I took his knife away and snapped the point off.  And I says to
"him, 'Now, you black beggar, every time at muster you'll show me that"
"knife, and there'll be peace in the land.'  And he done so, and there"
"was peace."""
"The captain (or ""Guffin"") smote his thigh."
"""You're right, Simcox, you're right, and if Salisbury was to take a"
"leaf out of your log-book in respects of handlin' Dagoes, 'twould be"
"better for all concerned.  But no, not him.  He goes on seein' them"
French make a fleet and he lets 'em!  He actually sees 'em with their
"fleet sharpenin' on the grindstone and never says from the poop,"
"'Chuck that overboard, you swine, or I'll come and 'andle you so's"
"you'll be glad to die.'"""
"The second mate was much gratified, as was obvious by his standing"
first on one foot and then on another.  But Lampert was not so
pleased.
"""Why, you talk--you, captain and you, Simcox--as if they had a fleet."
"Why, it's my opinion--and experts say 'ditto' to me there--that a"
"string o' band-boxes with crackers in 'em, and all on a mud-flat,"
would do as much harm as the French fleet--unless they blows up when
"we takes 'em."""
The Guffin shook his head.
"me by speaking English, though I shall not attempt to reproduce his"
"pronunciation. ""How far better it is to say: 'Monsieur, permit to me,'"
before one runs a man through than to do it as though one were sticking
"a mere pig. Is it not so?"""
"""True as sunshine, my dear count,"" I returned. ""There's a vast difference"
"between the trade of butchering and the gentle art of murder."""
"De Grammont threw back his head, laughing softly. ""Ah, good, good! Very"
"good, dear baron! The sentiment is beau-ti-ful and could not be better"
"expressed--in English. You should have been born across the channel."""
"""I wish I had been born any place, not excepting hell, rather than in"
"England,"" I answered."
"""True, true, what a hole it is,"" returned the count, regretfully. ""The"
"Englishman is one pig."""
He saw by the expression of my face that while I might abuse my own
"countrymen, I did not relish hearing it from others, so with true French"
tact he held up his hand to keep me from speaking till he could correct
himself.
"""Pardon, baron, I forgot the 'r,' The Englishman's affectation of a"
"virtue he despises makes of him a prig--not a pig. Non, non! Mon Dieu!"
"Not a pig--a prig! Is it not so?"""
"""True, true, count,"" I returned, unable to restrain a laugh. ""It is the"
"affectation of virtue that makes frank vice attractive by comparison."""
"""Ah, true, true, my dear baron. May I proceed with my errand?"""
"next year it comes up thicker. If you mow it down, remove the seeds,"
"sow it with salt and kill the field, you have a useless plot of land, a"
worthless territory. Then some day up comes weed and briar--which then
must be removed root and branch before the land is plantable again.
"Just remember, we are after a profitable exchange of economy, not"
another stellar system to list as a conquest for the sake of history
"our children will read. I want my reward now, or next week. Having my"
"name on a monument does not have much appeal."""
"He was half standing with his hands closed into fists, his knuckles on"
the table supporting him as he leaned forward to drive his facts home.
"""Or,"" he added scathingly, ""are you two firebrands so youthful that you"
don't know that a man has only one single lone chance at this business
of living? And that your finest reward at eventide is knowing you have
lived a full and eventful life without screwing it up somewhere along
"the line by making a lot of idiotic moves?"""
Viggon Sarri turned on a heel and walked out.
*       *       *       *       *
Naylo and Twill turned to Linus Brein.
"""What do you think?"" Twill asked."
"Linus Brein shrugged. ""He is undoubtedly right. Besides, we don't know"
"all there is to know about the strange race out there yet."""
"""Oh, faugh! What else--"""
"Linus Brein smiled. He said slowly. ""We don't even know whether or not"
for a place where you will be sure to find the very last person in the
"world you desire to see, you will meet with every success at the Kursaal"
of Ostend.
Such was Mrs. Winstanley’s passing thought one day. She was there with
"Sophia and Evan Wilmington. It was always a great pleasure, she used"
"to say, to have young people about her; and very naturally, since young"
people can be particularly useful in strange places to a middle-aged
"lady. The brother and sister fetched and carried for her all day long,"
"which was very nice and suitable, and Mrs. Winstanley was in her"
"most affable mood. On the day in question, however, she saw, to her"
"astonishment and annoyance, Canon Chisely and Yvonne making their way"
towards her through the crowded lines of tables.
"“Good gracious, Everard!” she said as they came up. “How did you find"
your way here? I thought you were going to Switzerland.”
"“So we are,” replied the Canon. “We have broken our journey. And as for"
"getting here, we took the boat from Dover and then walked.”"
"“The frivolity of the place is infecting you already, Canon,” cried"
"Sophia, with a laugh. “I hope you are going to stay a long time.”"
"“Oh, not too long,” said Yvonne. “It wouldn’t be fair to the Canon, who"
needs some mountain air. This is just a little treat all for me.”
She glanced at him affectionately as she spoke. It was good of him to
tarry for her sake in this Vanity Fair of a place.
"“We were going by Calais, as you know,” said the Canon, explanatively"
to Mrs. Winstanley. “We only changed our minds a day or two ago--we
thought it would be a little surprise for you.”
"""Why, it's mutiny, sir."""
"""Exactly! You can say you went out under duress."""
"""I never heard of such a thing,"" stormed the skipper. Then, more"
"quietly, ""But I don't seem to have any choice in the matter; do I?"""
"""None whatever."""
"""Tell them to go to hell!"" growled Balt from the open window above"
their head.
"A blasphemous outcry floated up from the launch, while heads protruded"
"from the deck-house openings, the faces white in the slanting glare."
"""Why don't you heave to?"" demanded a voice."
"Peasley stepped to the end of the bridge and called down: ""I can't"
"stop, my good man, they won't allow it, y' know. You'll have to bloody"
"well come aboard yourself."" Then, obedient to his command, the"
"search-light traced an arc through the darkness and died out, leaving"
"the little craft in darkness, save for its dim lantern."
"Unseen by the amazed quartermaster, who was startled out of speech and"
"action, Emerson gripped the Captain's shoulder and whispered his"
"thanks, while the Britisher grumbled under his breath:"
"""Bli' me! Won't that labor crowd be hot? They nearly bashed in my head"
"with that iron spike. Four hundred pounds! My word!"""
The sputter of the craft alongside was now punctuated by such a volley
"of curses that he raised his voice again: ""Belay that chatter, will"
"you? There's a lady aboard."""
"ruffian,"" said he to himself. ""If they have the same effect on Sallie, I"
"won't grudge the few francs I paid for them!"""
"He tiptoed down the short stairway, and, having tapped very quietly at"
"the door of the after-saloon, entered without more ado. He judged that"
he might have difficulty in gaining admission if he delayed to ask
leave.
The saloon was empty. But from an adjoining cabin came the sound of
"splashing, and from its neighbour the shuffle of heavy feet, a faint"
suggestion of deft hands busy among crisp muslin and sibilant silk.
Slyne hesitated; he wanted to be very tactful and yet was unwilling to
give up the advantage he had thus gained. He closed the door carefully
behind him. It creaked a little.
From the room whence had come the rustle of feminine garments an
"uncanny-looking figure appeared, and darted an angry, apprehensive"
glance about the saloon. The sound of splashing had ceased.
"""'Morning, Ambrizette,"" said Slyne briskly and standing his ground. ""Is"
your mistress up yet? Tell her I have Captain Dove's leave to pay her a
"call."""
"The dumb black dwarf's scowl grew darker, but her hand fell away from"
her breast and she halted as Sallie's voice sounded from within.
"""Is that you, Jasper!"" it ejaculated. ""What do you want? I thought--"""
"""I've come back--with good news for you, Sallie--wonderful news!"" said"
"Slyne. ""And I'm in no end of a hurry to be off again. Call Ambrizette in"
"and get dressed, as quick as you can. Captain Dove's waiting breakfast"
"""We seem to be working toward different objectives,"" Novosty answered."
"""Michael has a solution to everybody's problem. I regret very much"
"you've chosen not to help facilitate it."""
"""The only problem he solved was yours,"" she shot back. ""Mr. Vance"
devised what amounts to an enormous check kiting scheme. You two
"planned to perpetrate fraud. You're nothing better than criminals, both"
"of you, and I intend to make sure you haven't also given us a short"
"count."""
"""Comrade, fraud is a harsh word,"" Vance interjected."
"""You are not as amusing as you think,"" she replied."
"""Humor makes the world go round."""
'This is not a joke. The negotiable instruments in this room are Soviet
funds. I intend to make sure those funds are intact. There will be a
"full and complete count. Now."""
"She's gone over the edge, he told himself. She's definitely going to"
"try and screw us, either wittingly or unwittingly. But who in the room"
is going to help her? That huddled group of Russian bankers now staring
"terrified at Novosty's 9mm? Not damned likely. She's improvising, on"
her own. But her little stunt could well end up sinking the ship.
The two couriers were now spread against the brown textured fabric of
"the wall, legs apart. He walked over and reached into the leather"
"holsters at their hips, drawing out their revolvers. They were snub-"
"nosed Smith & Wesson Bodyguards, .38 caliber. He looked them over,"
"cocked them, and handed one to Eva."
"“One or two other little things,” replied Herold, judiciously. “I 'll"
copy them out and bring them to you. But go on.”
"“Well,” she said, “yesterday afternoon a little bird--I don't know what"
"kind of bird it was--came and sat on the window-sill, and turned his"
"head this way and looked at me, and turned his head that way and looked"
"at me, and I did n't move hand or foot, and I said, 'Cheep, cheep!' And"
he hopped on the bed and stayed there such a long time. And I talked
"to him, and he hopped about and looked at me and seemed to tell me all"
"sorts of wonderful things. But he did n't somehow, although he came from"
"the sky, and was a perfect dear. He must have known all about it, but he"
"did n't know how to tell me. Now, you and John come from the beautiful"
world and tell me wonderful things about it; and I shall never go there
"really, but I can live in it through you.”"
"Constable, the Great Dane, known by this abbreviated title in familiar"
"life, rose, stretched himself, and went and snuggled his head beneath"
"John's arm. John turned, his arm round the hound's neck."
"“But you can live in it through anybody, dear,” said he--“your Uncle"
"Oliver, your Aunt Julia, or anybody who comes to see you.”"
Stellamaris looked at Herold for a characteristically sympathetic
"moment, and then at John. She sighed."
"“I told you it was hard to explain. But don't you see, Belovedest? You"
and Walter are like my gull. Everybody else is like the little bird. You
"know how to tell me and make me live. The others are darlings, but they"
don't seem to know how to do it.”
John scratched his head.
"There was no one in the lobby when he arrived there--no dead bodies,"
"either. But on the sidewalk, in front of the building, a woman lay dead"
in a pool of blood.
"In a sick rage, Taber looked in both directions and saw the android dive"
through a group of people half a block away. He tipped them over like
tenpins and ran on. Taber gripped the gun tight and started in pursuit.
He could not fire because there was enough sidewalk traffic to make it
"dangerous. On ahead, the android's path was blocked by a man. He sought"
to get clear but the android passed him close enough to jam the knife
into his neck and send him screaming to the sidewalk.
"A uniformed patrolman appeared on the other side of the street, further"
down. He took the situation in and understood Taber's frantic gesture. A
"car screamed to a halt as the patrolman raced across the street, drawing"
his gun.
"The android, seeing his escape cut off, veered into an areaway. The"
patrolman got there first and plunged in after him.
"Taber, gasps tearing at his lungs, arrived thirty seconds later. During"
"that time, he'd expected the sound of shots from the patrolman's gun."
But there was silence.
"He braked on his heels, skidded into the areaway, and saw the android"
"advancing on the patrolman. The latter stood motionless, the gun hanging"
useless at his side.
"""Drop! Drop!"" Taber yelled. He cursed as he tried to angle in the narrow"
areaway in order to get a clear shot.
"the limits of official discretion. If I now disclosed half, or a"
"quarter, of what he told me of the inner working of the Secret"
"Service, Scotland Yard, which admires and loves him, would cast him"
"out, lock him up securely in gaol, and prepare for me a safe"
"harbourage in a contiguous cell. So for both our sakes I must be very,"
very careful.
"""You have been most helpful to me,"" he said handsomely at parting,"
"""and if anything good turns up on the North-East coast, I will let you"
"know. Could you come if I sent for you?"""
"""I would contrive to manage it,"" said I."
"Dawson went away, and the pressure of daily work and interests thrust"
"him from my mind. For a month I heard nothing of him or of Cary, and"
then one morning came a letter and a telegram. The letter was from
"Richard Cary, and read as follows: ""A queer thing has happened here."
A cruiser which had come in for repair was due to go out this morning.
"She was ready for sea the night before, the officers and crew had all"
"come back from short leave, and the working parties had cleared out."
"Then in the middle watch, when the torpedo lieutenant was testing the"
"circuits, it was discovered that all the cables leading to the guns"
"had been cut. Dawson has been called in, and bids me say that, if you"
"can come down, now is the chance of your life. I will put you up."""
"The telegram was from Dawson himself. It ran: ""They say I'm beaten."
"But I'm not. Come and see."""
"""The deuce,"" said I. ""Sabotage! I am off."""
"""Now you be careful, Ferdinand,"" Sis called after me as she opened a"
"book called _Family Problems of the Frontier Woman_. ""Remember you're"
"a nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you."""
I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in
"front of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their"
hammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's
crews are men; women are too busy with important things like government
to run ships. I felt free all over--and happy. Now was my chance to
really see the _Eleanor Roosevelt_!
*       *       *       *       *
It was hard to believe I was traveling in space at last. Ahead and
"behind me, all the way up to where the companionway curved in out"
"of sight, there was nothing but smooth black wall and smooth white"
"doors--on and on and on. _Gee_, I thought excitedly, this is _one big"
ship_!
"Of course, every once in a while I would run across a big scene of"
stars in the void set in the wall; but they were only pictures. Nothing
that gave the feel of great empty space like I'd read about in _The Boy
"Rocketeers_, no portholes, no visiplates, nothing."
"So when I came to the crossway, I stopped for a second, then turned"
"left. To the right, see, there was Deck Four, then Deck Three, leading"
inward past the engine fo'c'sle to the main jets and the grav helix
going _purr-purr-purrty-purr_ in the comforting way big machinery has
"when it's happy and oiled. But to the left, the crossway led all the"
way to the outside level which ran just under the hull. There were
portholes on the hull.
"She looked at me keenly, and I fancied her colour rose. But she only"
"answered, 'Yes, Martin. But you see I have not one. I am alone.'"
"'And lonely, my lady?'"
"'Sometimes,' she answered, smiling sadly."
"'But this evening?' I replied, feeling that there was still something"
I did not understand. 'I should not have thought you would be feeling
"that way. I have not been here, but when I came in, my lady----'"
"'Pshaw!' she answered with a laugh of disdain. 'Those boys, Martin?"
"They can laugh, fight, and ride; but for the rest, pouf! They are not"
"company. However, it is bedtime, and you must go. I think you have"
"done me good. Good night. I wish--I wish I could do you good,' she"
"added kindly, almost timidly."
To some extent she had. I went away feeling that mine was not the only
"trouble in the world, nor my loneliness the only loneliness. She was a"
"stranger in a besieged city, a woman among men, exposed, despite her"
"rank, to many of a woman's perils; and doubtless she had felt Fraulein"
Max's defection and the Waldgrave's strange conduct more deeply than
any one watching her daily bearing would have supposed. So much the
"greater reason was there that I should do my duty loyally, and putting"
"her first to whom I owed so much, let no sorrow of my own taint my"
service.
But God knows there is one passion that defies argument. The house
next Herr Krapp's had a fascination for me which I could not resist;
"and though I did not again leave my lady unguarded, but arranged that"
"Steve should stop at home and watch the door, four o'clock the next"
afternoon saw me sneaking away in search of St. Austin's. Of course I
He intended to make sure it didn't. The planning had been split-second
up until now; this was no moment to relax his guard.
"Yes, it was good he was here. As he studied Comrade Karanova, he"
realized that something about her was still making him uneasy. So far
"it was merely a hunch, but his hunches had been right more often than"
he liked to think.
He tried to push the feeling aside. Probably just paranoia. She
"obviously was here today for the same reason he was, to make sure the"
Soviet money was returned safely. She probably was also still worried
"about the protocol, but that problem was hers, not his. From today on,"
the KGB would have to work out their in-fighting back home the best way
they could. The ground rules were changing fast in Moscow.
"Besides, Dzerzhinsky Square was about to become part of a previous life"
"for him. If he could just clear this up, get his commission, he'd be"
set. Forever. Enough was enough. Maybe he'd end up in the Caribbean
"like Michael, drinking margaritas and counting string bikinis."
The elevator door opened. Facing them were Michael Vance and Eva
Borodin.
"""Glad you could make it."" Vance glanced coldly at Vera. ""Right on time."
"The money arrives in exactly seven minutes."""
"She nodded a silent greeting, pulling her sable coat tighter as she"
strode past. The bank officials lined up along the corridor watched her
"with nervous awe. Even in London, T-Directorate brass had clout."
They moved as a group down the long carpeted hallway leading to the
"counting room. On this floor everything was high-security, with"
"""Mr. Vance."" Vera Karanova watched as the two security men unlatched"
their satchels and began withdrawing the bundles of open cashiers
"checks and bearer bonds. ""I want to recount these securities, now."""
"""There're double-counted tallys already prepared""--he pointed toward the"
"bundles--""yesterday by the main branch of Moscow Narodny. The printouts"
"are attached."""
"""That was their count,"" she replied. ""I intend to make my own, before"
"we go any further."""
"Which means time lost, he thought. Doesn't she realize we've got to get"
"this cash recycled, those bonds purchased and in place, before Tanzan"
Mino's _kobun _have a chance to move on us? If the deal to acquire
"Ken's new Mino Industries debentures doesn't go through, giving us"
something to hold over the godfather's head . . .
She's literally playing into his hands.
"""The instruments are all here, all negotiable, and all ready to go,"" he"
"said, stealing a quick glance toward Eva. One look at her eyes told him"
"she also sensed trouble brewing. ""Now, we're damn well going to move"
"and move fast. We credit the funds here, then wire them to Westminster"
"Union. And by God we do it immediately."""
"""Mr. Vance, you are no longer giving the orders,"" she replied sharply."
"""I'm in charge here now. As a matter of fact, I have no intention of"
wiring the money anywhere. There will be no purchase of debentures. As
"far as I'm concerned, it has now been returned."" She paused for"
"emphasis. ""But first we will count it."""
CHAPTER XXIII.
THE FLIGHT.
"One of the men--it was I--muttered something to Marie, and she snuffed"
"the wick, and blew up the light. In a moment it filled the room,"
"disclosing a strange medley of levelled weapons, startled faces, and"
flashing eyes. In one corner Fraulein Max and the two women cowered
"behind one another, trembling and staring. At the table sat my lady,"
"with dull, dazed eyes, looking on, yet scarcely understanding what was"
"happening. On either side of her stood Steve and I, covering the"
"general with our pistols, while the Waldgrave, who was still too weak"
"for much exertion, kept guard at the door."
"Tzerclas was the first to speak. 'What is this foolery?' he said,"
scowling unutterable curses at us. 'What does this mean?'
"'This!' I said, producing a piece of hide rope. 'We are going to tie"
"you up. If you struggle, general, you die. If you submit, you live."
"That is all. Go to work, Steve.'"
"There was a gleam in Tzerclas' eye, which warned me to stand back and"
"crook my finger. His face was black with fury, and for an instant I"
thought that he would spring upon us and dare all. But prudence and
"the pistols prevailed. With an evil look he sat still, and in a trice"
Steve had a loop round his arms and was binding him to the heavy
chair.
I knew then that as far as he was concerned we were safe; and I turned
"to bid the women get cloaks and food, adjuring them to be quick, since"
"rights, huggin’ a bunch o’ calico in de hot-house. She side-stepped in"
to pull some posies and yer was squeezin’ de oder gal to beat de band.
"She says it looked cute, all right all right, but it made her sick. She"
"says yer better git busy, and make a sneak for de train.”"
The young man gave a low whistle and his eyes flashed with a sudden
"thought. His hand flew to the inside pocket of his coat, and drew out a"
"handful of letters. Selecting one, he handed it to the boy, following"
it with a silver dollar from his vest-pocket.
"“Give that letter to the lady,” he said, “and ask her to read it. Tell"
"her that it should explain the situation. Tell her that, if she had"
"mingled a little trust with her conception of the ideal, much heartache"
might have been avoided. Tell her that the loyalty she prizes so much
has never wavered. Tell her I am waiting for an answer.”
The messenger stood before the lady.
“De gent says he’s had de ski-bunk put on him widout no cause. He says
"he’s no bum guy; and, lady, yer read dat letter, and I’ll bet yer he’s"
"a white sport, all right.”"
"The young lady unfolded the letter; somewhat doubtfully, and read it."
Dear Dr. Arnold:   I want to thank you for your most kind and opportune
"aid to my daughter last Friday evening, when she was overcome by an"
attack of her old heart-trouble in the conservatory at Mrs. Waldron’s
reception. Had you not been near to catch her as she fell and to render
"proper attention, we might have lost her. I would be glad if you would"
call and undertake the treatment of her case.
"for some word of Lavender, but the words failed in her throat. Cold,"
"forlorn, hungry, she crept to her room, threw off her clothes and"
huddled down into the bed-clothes.
"They would all blame her--Miss Vine and Mr. Dugald, Aunt Achsa, Doctor"
Blackwell. Probably now Pola would have more complexes to suffer;
Pola's mother would be angry and they could never be friends again. And
Mart--Aunt Achsa had said old Mrs. Calkins could be terrible when she
"was ""worked up!"" Even if Lavender lived Aunt Achsa would never forgive"
her and if he _didn't_ live--Mr. Dugald had said he was fighting. Those
boards creaking faintly meant that Doctor Blackwell and Aunt Achsa were
helping Lavender fight. Dear old Lav with his fine dreams!
The desperate longing for Trude shook her. She sobbed into her pillow.
And yet the longing brought only added remorse. Trude would scold her.
Trude would take her home. That meant stinging humiliation. How Vick
would laugh at her when everything was over. A case of rum! Sidney
writhed under the soft covers.
Somewhere boards creaked again--Lavender's fight. Sidney pictured the
doctor and Aunt Achsa bending over him. And outside everything was so
"quiet and gray. That was the way death probably came, Sidney thought."
On the morrow they would send her home--in disgrace. She might not even
"be allowed to see Lavender, or Mart, or Pola--or Mr. Dugald. Someone"
would telegraph to Trude and Trude would meet her back at Middletown.
"She would live a long, sad life of penance behind the crumbing stone"
wall she had so detested.
But the thought of the wall and the shelter of the old house brought
such a surcease of torment that the girl had fallen into a heavy sleep.
When she wakened it was to a consciousness of bright sunshine--and
"alone!"""
"""Oh, yes, I can,"" she murmured. ""I always make things alone!"""
"I tried to fathom the meaning of this, but gave it up and started to go"
"on deck. If I could take her father off to one side and explain, well"
and good. He would perhaps sympathize with my mistake when he understood
that it was partially the result of a desire to fill Monsieur with
"spirits. Considering this, I spoiled everything by asking:"
"""What does he look like?"""
"""My father?"" she gasped, in a wondering way."
"""No--yes--certainly not! I mean--oh, this is intolerable! I don't know"
"your father, never saw him in my life--unless he was the one with you"
last night when you drove me frantic with that ball of paper trick! But
what you did has nothing to do with my being here. I've not wilfully
followed. A stupid boatman mistook your yacht for my own when I was--I
"mean to say, when I was too engrossed with the memory of you to notice"
"his mistake."""
"From alarm her look gave way to wonderment, then almost to mirth. It was"
"a hard place for a girl to be in, and I expected her to leave me now,"
find the old chap and promptly have me hanged to a yard-arm. The fact
that there are no yard-arms on schooner yachts made no difference. And I
"do believe she was considering that when a sailor passed us, looking"
enough like Tommy to have been his twin brother.
"""Jack,"" she said to him, ""tell Mr. Graham to come below!"""
"The fellow saluted and left, and I stared at her in surprise, saying:"
removed from the trunk of your family tree. He had only the faintest
tinge of blue blood in his veins. He was an absolute outsider. We'll
"hear no more about _him_ now."""
"""You mean that it's an absolutely sure thing for her,"" Captain Dove"
"suggested, and Mr. Jobling looked pained."
"""I can't afford to risk anything on uncertainties, sir,"" he answered"
"stiffly. ""And I'll stake my professional reputation on--"""
"""Oh, never mind about all that,"" Slyne broke in, folding his share of"
"the papers together and pocketing them. ""The syndicate's safely floated."
And now--as to our next move.
"""You'd better get away back to Genoa by the five o'clock train, Dove."
And you must take Ambrizette with you; I'll get Sal--Lady Josceline
another maid in Paris--one who won't attract quite so much attention to
us as that damned dwarf would.
"""Jobling and I will go on there by the night-mail, on our way to London"
with--Lady Josceline. You can take the _Olive Branch_ round to some safe
"English port and lay her up there in the meantime. As soon as you land,"
you can rejoin us--at Jobling's address. By that time we'll probably be
"ready to redeem our note to you."""
"""By that time,"" Captain Dove returned with concentrated bitterness,"
"""you'll have found some way to give me the slip altogether. D'ye take me"
"for a blind idiot, Slyne? D'ye think I'm going to let Sallie out of my"
"sight, with you?"""
"Slyne was visibly disconcerted. ""But--aren't you going to take your ship"
"round to England?"" he asked, in genuine surprise. ""You can't very well"
"and saw, a hundred yards or so away, a bent and dreary figure trudging"
down the metal paving of the street. It was a figure like those to be
"seen on Earth, which placed it as belonging to Greca's race."
"The tall leader drew forth one of the shock-tubes. Seen near at hand,"
it was observed to be bafflingly simple in appearance. It seemed
devoid of all mechanism--simply a tube of reddish metal with a sort of
handle formed of a coil of heavy wire.
The Rogan pointed the tube at the distant figure.
"Greca screamed, and screamed again. Coincident with her cry, as though"
"the sound of it had felled him, the distant slave dropped to the"
pavement.
*       *       *       *       *
That was all. The tube had merely been pointed: as far as Brand could
"see, the Rogan's ""hand"" had not moved on the barrel of the tube, nor"
even constricted about the coil of wire that formed its handle. Yet
"that distant figure had dropped. Furthermore, fumes of greasy black"
smoke now began to arise from the huddled body; and in less than
thirty seconds there was left no trace of it on the gleaming metal
pavement.
"""So that's what those things are like at full power!"" breathed Dex."
"""My God!"""
"The Rogan leader spoke a few words. Greca, huddled despairingly on the"
"floor, crushed by this brutal annihilation of one of her country-men"
"before her very eyes, did not translate. But translation was"
"unnecessary. The Rogan's icy, triumphant eyes, the very posture of"
"""Won't you sit down?"" he suggested with debonair courtesy."
But she shook her head; she was evidently afraid to receive him on any
such friendly footing. She did not even care to ask him what he was
doing in evening dress at breakfast-time and on board the _Olive
Branch_. But in her troubled eyes he could read that unspoken inquiry.
"""I've been travelling all night to get back to you, Sallie,"" he told"
"her, in a low, eager tone, ""and I hadn't time to change--I was in such a"
hurry to tell you the news. I've come to take you away from the _Olive
"Branch_,--and Captain Dove. I've come to set you free."""
"She stared at him as though she had not heard aright, her lips parted,"
"her eyebrows arched, a faint, puzzled, questioning frown on her"
forehead.
"""I've come to set you free,"" he said again."
"""At what price?"" she asked suddenly, with disconcerting directness, and"
his would-be straightforward glance wavered.
"""Don't put it that way!"" he urged. ""I ask no more than the fulfilment of"
"the promise you made me. And--listen, Sallie. I've found out who you"
really are and where your home is. I'll take you there if only you--
"""I'm not asking you to marry me right away, either, remember. All you"
must do in the meantime is to sign without question some papers that
will be required. Then I'll make everything quite safe for you and take
"you to your own home."""
The quick doubt in her eyes had given place to an expression of helpless
amazement and growing dismay. But he did not wait to hear anything she
"we are beginning to quarrel, Everard? It is slightly vulgar. I am your"
"oldest friend, remember, and I am trying to acquit myself of a painful"
duty to you.”
"“Duty is one of the chief instruments of the devil, if you will excuse"
"my saying so,” replied the Canon."
"“Oh, very well then, Everard,” she said hotly. “You can go on being"
a fool as long as you like. I saw your wife struggling in this man’s
"embrace, more or less, this morning. Two or three strange coincidences"
have been forced upon my notice. For your sake I have been excessively
"anxious. My conscience tells me I ought to take you into my confidence,"
and I can do no more. You can see the Christian name of this Bazouge
"in the Visitors’ List, and adopt what course of action you think fit."
I wash my hands of the whole matter. And I must say that from the very
"beginning, two years ago, you have treated me all through with the"
greatest want of consideration.”
The Canon did not heed the peroration. He stood with the flimsy sheet
"clenched in his hand and regarded her sternly. She shrank a little, for"
her soul seemed to be naked.
“You have tried to ferret this out through spite against Yvonne. Whether
"the horrible thing you imply is true or not, I shall find it hard to"
forgive you.”
"Mrs. Winstanley shrugged her shoulders. “In either case, you will come"
"to your senses, I hope. Meanwhile, considering the present relations, it"
might be pleasanter not to meet at dinner to-night.”
"“I am sorry to have to agree with you, Emmeline,” said the Canon."
"""And what's more,"" said Slyne, playing a trump card with great outward"
"indifference, ""you can make him pay you for your time instead of you"
paying him. I told you I came back here to do you a good turn. There's
more than a hundred thousand dollars of easy money for you in this
deal--if you go the right way about it.
"""But--don't take my word for anything."""
Captain Dove had palpable difficulty in suppressing the obvious repartee
to that last bit of advice. But cupidity and cunning kept him quiet for
a space.
"""All right. I'll go with you,"" he agreed very gruffly at last. And Slyne"
heaved a silent sigh of relief; he had feared more than once that the
contest of wills would after all go against him.
"""You're wise,"" he commented carelessly. ""It will pay you."
"""You'd better see Sallie now, don't you think, and tell her--"""
"""I'm not going to interfere between you and her--till I get my money"
"from you,"" declared the old man with a crafty grin. ""You must tackle her"
"yourself. She'll be up by now, but breakfast won't be ready for half an"
hour. If I were you I'd take that coat off and let her have a sight of
"those diamonds of yours."""
"Slyne did not wait to hear any more. He was already on his way aft, a"
somewhat incongruous figure on the decks of the _Olive Branch_. When he
reached the companion-hatch on the poop he was smiling sardonically.
"""I do believe it was my 'diamonds' that finally fetched that old"
"""Yes. He is coming up soon for instructions. It's his last chance, as"
it is mine. He sees that he must be held responsible for the wire
"cutting in the _Antinous_, and to some slight extent also in the"
"_Antigone_, and that if anything goes wrong with the _Malplaquet_ he"
"will be dismissed. I shall be sorry to lose him, for he is an"
"exceptionally good man, but we can't allow failures in petty officer"
"detectives any more than we can in chief inspectors."""
"""Where does Trehayne come from? His name sounds Cornish,"" I asked."
"""Falmouth, I believe. He is quite young, but he has had nearly three"
years in the _Vernon_ at Portsmouth and in the torpedo factory at
Greenock. A first-class engineer and electrician and a sound
detective. He has been with me for some twelve months. You will see
"him if he calls soon."""
I had been thinking hard over the details of Dawson's plans while the
"talk went on, and then ventured to offer some comments."
"""It is fortunate that you have grown a moustache since you were in the"
"north; you could not have been a Marine as a clean-shaven man."""
"""I often have to shave it,"" said Dawson, ""but I always grow it again"
between whiles. One can take it off quicker than one can put it on
again. False hair is the devil; I have never used it yet and never
will. So whenever I have a spell of leisure I grow a moustache against
"emergencies--like this one."""
"My next comment was rather difficult to make, for I did not wish"
"either Cary or Dawson to divine its purpose. ""If I may make a"
suggestion to a man of your experience it would be that none of your
whilst I settle the bill and ask for food for the journey. The brown
woman fishes out from a huge black pot in the background sundry hunks of
"coarse boiled pork, and gives me two of these, hot, with bread and salt."
This is the luncheon. I pay the bill: which amounts to twenty-four
"francs, for everything. (One says francs or liras, irrespective, in"
"Italy.) At that moment arrives the train from Cagliari, and men rush in,"
"roaring for the soup--or rather, for the broth. ""Ready, ready!"" she"
"cries, going to the black pot."
V.
TO SORGONO.
"The various trains in the junction squatted side by side and had long,"
long talks before at last we were off. It was wonderful to be running in
"the bright morning towards the heart of Sardinia, in the little train"
"that seemed so familiar. We were still going third class, rather to the"
disgust of the railway officials at Mandas.
"At first the country was rather open: always the long spurs of hills,"
"steep-sided, but not high. And from our little train we looked across"
"the country, across hill and dale. In the distance was a little town, on"
"a low slope. But for its compact, fortified look it might have been a"
town on the English downs. A man in the carriage leaned out of the
"window holding out a white cloth, as a signal to someone in the far off"
"town that he was coming. The wind blew the white cloth, the town in the"
distance glimmered small and alone in its hollow. And the little train
pelted along.
"""That boy--there!"" she gasped, ""he frightens me--oh hateful! make him go"
"away!"" And she clutched the young man's arm with such a quick nervous"
"grasp, that a crimson flush rose quickly to Rollo's cheek."
"""No,"" muttered Etienne to himself as he watched the performance"
"critically, ""she was never in love with you, sir! She never did as much"
"for you as that. But on the whole, with a temper like Mistress Concha's,"
"I think you are well out of it, Monsieur Etienne!"" Which wise dictum"
might or might not be based on the fox's opinion as to sour grapes.
All unconsciously Rollo reached a protecting hand across to the little
white fingers which gripped his arm so tightly.
"""Go away, boy,"" he commanded; ""do you not see that you terrify the"
"Señorita?"""
"""I see--that is why I stay!"" cried the amiable youth gleefully,"
flourishing his crutch about his head as if on the point of launching it
at the party.
Rollo laid his hand on the hilt of Killiecrankie with a threatening
gesture.
"""If you come an inch nearer, I will give you plague!"" cried the boy,"
"showing his teeth wickedly, ""and your wench also. You will grow"
"black--yes, and swell! Then you will die, both of you. And there will be"
"no one to bury you, like those in the houses back there. Then all you"
"possess shall be mine, ha, ha!"""
And he laughed and danced till a fit of coughing came upon him so that
he actually crowed in a kind of fiendish exaltation. But Rollo Blair was
"not a man to be jested with, either by devil or devil's imp. He drew a"
"accents, eloquently addressed to the fair Aileen. They writhed in their"
"chairs to gaze around and over the impending form of Tildy, that"
Aileen’s pulchritude might season and make ambrosia of their bacon and
eggs.
And Tildy was content to be the unwooed drudge if Aileen could receive
the flattery and the homage. The blunt nose was loyal to the short
Grecian. She was Aileen’s friend; and she was glad to see her rule
hearts and wean the attention of men from smoking pot-pie and lemon
meringue. But deep below our freckles and hay-coloured hair the
"unhandsomest of us dream of a prince or a princess, not vicarious, but"
coming to us alone.
There was a morning when Aileen tripped in to work with a slightly
bruised eye; and Tildy’s solicitude was almost enough to heal any
optic.
"“Fresh guy,” explained Aileen, “last night as I was going home at"
"Twenty-third and Sixth. Sashayed up, so he did, and made a break. I"
"turned him down, cold, and he made a sneak; but followed me down to"
"Eighteenth, and tried his hot air again. Gee! but I slapped him a good"
"one, side of the face. Then he give me that eye. Does it look real"
"awful, Til? I should hate that Mr. Nicholson should see it when he"
comes in for his tea and toast at ten.”
Tildy listened to the adventure with breathless admiration. No man had
ever tried to follow her. She was safe abroad at any hour of the
twenty-four. What bliss it must have been to have had a man follow one
and black one’s eye for love!
"Among the customers at Bogle’s was a young man named Seeders, who"
"worked in a laundry office. Mr. Seeders was thin and had light hair,"
"""I am going as one of the Marine sentries."""
"""It's no use, Dawson,"" protested I emphatically. ""You are a wonder at"
"disguise, and will look, I do not doubt, the very spit of a Marine."
But you can't pass among the men for half an hour without discovery.
"They are a class apart, they talk their own language, cherish their"
"own secret traditions, live in a world to which no stranger ever"
penetrates. You could pass as a naval officer more easily than you
"could as a Pongo. It is sheer madness, Dawson."""
"He gave a short laugh. ""Much you know about it. I have served in the"
"Red Corps myself. I was a recruit at Deal, passed two years at"
"Plymouth, and served afloat for three years. I was then drafted into"
the Naval Police. Afterwards I was recommended for detective work in
"the dockyards, and at the end of my Marine service joined the Yard. My"
"good man, I was a sergeant before I left the Corps."""
"""I give up, Dawson,"" said I. ""Nothing about you will ever surprise me"
"again. Not even if you claim to have been a Cabinet Minister."""
"A queer smile stole over his face. ""No, I have not been a minister,"
"but I have attended a meeting of the Cabinet."""
"Cary interposed at this point. ""Yours is a fine idea, Mr. Dawson. As a"
Marine sentry you can get yourself posted by the Major wherever you
"please, and the Guard will not talk even though they may wonder that"
any man should want to do twenty-four hours of duty per day. The
"Marines are the closest, faith-fullest, and best disciplined force in"
the wide world. Bluejackets will gossip; Marines never. You will be
"able to watch more closely than even Trehayne, who, I suppose, will"
"also be on board."""
"smooth, the delicate tracery of veins could be distinctly seen, and each"
"muscle stood out hard and taut; there was no superfluous flesh, but a"
firmness and excellence of condition that brought a smile of
"satisfaction to Grey’s face.  He turned with a smile to Dick, who stood"
by beaming.
"""Not much fear of him to-day, eh, Dicon?"""
"""He would jump the moon, master, if you asked it of him,"" was the proud"
and confident answer.
"""How do the others look?  Have you seen them?"""
"""Pretty bits of horseflesh every one; and there is a black stallion of"
Mr. Artheret’s that will take some beating.  But he’s too heavy for some
of the jumps. He don’t take off fast enough.  And he’s a nasty temper
"too.  There’s a gray Arab with pace; but he falls away behind, as they"
all do.  I don’t think Don Carlos will be troubled long by him.  None of
"the others will take much beating.  Pretty to look at, but not trained"
"for what they’ve got to do.  Lord Sandford was here yesterday early,"
"looking at the jumps, and he had several of them made stiffer; but"
"there’s nothing Don Carlos cannot sail over like a bird!"""
"""Let us go and see,"" said Grey.  ""I will take a canter on the turf to"
"warm myself to the saddle. Soh, boy, soh!"" as he lightly vaulted to his"
"seat, and the horse curveted beneath him.  ""We will take a look at these"
"obstructions.  The stiffer they are, the better you and I will be"
"pleased—eh, my beauty?"""
"Dick mounted his nag, and rode beside his master to the course, where"
the horses were to be matched against each other when Lord Sandford and
"his friends should have finished their merry meal, and be ready to"
"changing slowly."""
"""Nay, the Queen herself will never change!"" cried Wylde, with an"
"emphatic gesture.  ""The Duchess has changed, and she seeks to use her"
"influence with the Queen to make her change also, and give up her Tory"
advisers altogether.  But she will not succeed.  The Queen may be timid
"and gentle, but she has all her father’s tenacity and obstinacy.  Let my"
Lady of Marlborough look to it!  She may strain the cord to breaking
"point.  Already they say that the new favourite, Mrs. Masham, is ousting"
"her kinswoman, the Duchess, from the foremost place in the Queen’s"
affections.  Favourites have fallen ere this through too great
"arrogance.  The victories of Ramillies and Oudenarde, and the successes"
"that have followed, make the Duke the idol of the nation and the"
"favourite of the Queen yet; but the day may come when this may change,"
"and then the high Tories may come in once more with a rush."""
"""I should be sorry for the Duke to lose favour,"" spoke Grey"
"thoughtfully.  ""I did see him once, and had speech with him after the"
"battle of Ramillies, and a more gracious and courtly gentleman it has"
"never been my lot to meet."""
Suddenly the Old Lion’s eyes flashed fire.
"""You have seen and had speech with the Duke on the field of Ramillies?"
"You saw the battle, or something of it?  Speak!  Tell me all!  I must"
"hear this tale.  It may mean much to us both."""
"""In sooth it is little I can tell you of the battle, for I was in the"
thick of it myself.  It was by accident that my servant and I came upon
the rival armies; and another happy accident gave me the chance of doing
"a small service for the Duke.  After the battle, when we were hard by"
"Louvain, he called me to him, and spoke many gracious words. I would"
"""We have one last chance here to deal with this problem. Tomorrow the"
"_oyabun's_ people arrive, and then they will be in control. The"
decisions will no longer be ours. Tonight I attempted to salvage the
"situation and failed. Surely you know what that means, for us both. But"
"if you will give me Vance, perhaps we can both still be saved. If you"
"refuse to cooperate, the _oyabun _will destroy you as well as Vance. We"
"both know that. I am offering you a way out."""
"""With deepest gratitude, I must tell you it is too late, Sato-sama,"
"which I am sure you realize,"" Nogami said, drawing on his cigar and"
"taking care not to disturb the ash. ""So with due respect I must inquire"
"concerning the purpose of this meeting."""
"""I need to locate this man Vance. Before the _kobun _from Tokyo arrive."
"If you care about his well-being, then you should remember that his"
"treatment at my hands will be more understanding than--"""
"""When do they arrive?"""
"""As I said, we received word that they will be here tomorrow, Nogami-"
"san. With respect, you have befriended a man who is attempting to"
"blackmail the Tokyo _oyabun_. That is a career decision which, I assure"
"you, is most unwise."""
"""It is made. And I am aware of the consequences. So it would appear we"
"both know all there is to know about the future."""
"""Perhaps not entirely. Someone has attempted to make us think Vance and"
"the woman were kidnapped, that they are being held somewhere beyond our"
"reach. Perhaps it is true, perhaps it is not. But if the transaction"
"for the hundred million is to take place tomorrow, then he must appear"
THE HAT OF THE _HULDRES_
"Once upon a time there was a big wedding at a certain farmstead, and a"
certain cottager was on his way to the wedding-feast. As he chanced to
"cross a field, he found a milk-strainer, such as are usually made of"
"cows' tails, and looking just like an old brown rag. He picked it up,"
"for he thought it could be washed, and then he would give it to his"
wife for a dish-rag. But when he came to the house where they were
"celebrating the wedding, it seemed as though no one saw him. The bride"
"and groom nodded to the rest of the guests, they spoke to them and"
poured for them; but he got neither greeting nor drink. Then the chief
cook came and asked the other folk to sit down to the table; but he was
"not asked, nor did he get anything to eat. For he did not care to sit"
down of his own accord when no one had asked him. At last he grew angry
"and thought: ""I might as well go home, for not a soul pays a bit of"
"attention to me here."" When he reached home, he said: ""Good evening,"
"here I am back again."""
"""For heaven's sake, are you back again?"" asked his wife."
"""Yes, there was no one there who paid any attention to me, or even so"
"much as looked at me,"" said the man, ""and when people show me so little"
"consideration, it seems as though I have nothing to look for there."""
"""But where are you? I can hear you, but I cannot see you!"" cried his"
wife.
"The man was invisible, for what he had found was a _huldre_ hat."
"""What are you talking about? Can't you see me? Have you lost your wits?"""
"""Nehal--turn back! Turn back!"""
He did not understand her. He thought she was still pleading with him.
"""I can not--God have pity on us both!"""
Then she too set her lips. She could not betray the last hope of that
heroic handful of men and women behind her. He must go to his
"death--and she to hers. She fired,--whether with success or not, she"
never knew. In that same instant another sound broke upon their
"ears--the sound of distant firing, the rattle of drums and the high"
clear call of a trumpet. Nehal Singh swung around. She caught a
"glimpse of his face through the smoke, and she saw something written"
there which she could not understand. She only knew that his features
"seemed to bear a new familiarity, as though a mask had been torn from"
"them, revealing the face of another man, of a man whom she had seen"
"before, when and where she could not tell. She had no time to analyze"
her emotions nor the sense of violent shock which passed over her. She
"heard Nehal Singh giving sharp, rapid orders in Hindustani. The room"
emptied. She saw him follow the retreating natives. At the door he
turned and looked back at her. At no time had his love for her
revealed itself more clearly than in that last glance.
"""The English regiment has come to help you,"" he said. ""Fate has"
"intervened between us this time. May we never meet again!"""
"He passed out through the shattered doorway, but she stood where he"
"had left her, motionless, almost unconscious. It was thus Nicholson"
"and the Colonel found her when, a moment later, they entered the room"
by the verandah. Colonel Carmichael's passionate reproaches died away
as he saw her face.
"There was a train back to Cagliari that night, said the conductor, at"
which the fat man nearly burst out of his clothing like a bursting
seed-pod. He bounced on his seat. What good was that? What good was a
"train back to Cagliari, when their home was in Snelli! Making matters"
worse--
"So they bounced and jerked and argued at one another, to their hearts'"
"content. Then the conductor retired, smiling subtly, in a way they have."
"Our fat friend looked at us with hot, angry, ashamed, grieved eyes and"
"said it was a shame. Yes, we chimed, it _was_ a shame. Whereupon a"
self-important miss who said she came from some Collegio at Cagliari
advanced and asked a number of impertinent questions in a tone of pert
"sympathy. After which our fat friend, left alone, covered his clouded"
"face with his hand, turned his back on the world, and gloomed."
"It had all been so dramatic that in spite of ourselves we laughed, even"
while the q-b shed a few tears.
*       *       *       *       *
"Well, the journey lasted hours. We came to a station, and the conductor"
said we must get out: these coaches went no further. Only two coaches
"would proceed to Mandas. So we climbed out with our traps, and our fat"
"friend with his saddle-bag, the picture of misery."
The one coach into which we clambered was rather crowded. The only other
coach was most of it first-class. And the rest of the train was freight.
We were two insignificant passenger wagons at the end of a long string
of freight-vans and trucks.
"There was an empty seat, so we sat on it: only to realize after about"
"five minutes, that a thin old woman with two children--her"
sleep. Good-night.”
"“Good-night,” she said miserably."
"And so, without touch of hand, they parted."
"The hours of the evening wore on, and night came. At last she cried"
herself to sleep. It had been a day of tears.
They left Ostend quietly the following morning by the Dover boat. During
the whole journey the Canon treated Yvonne with the deferential courtesy
"he could always assume to women, seeing to her comforts, anticipating"
"her wants, even exchanging now and then casual remarks on passing"
objects of interest. But of the subject next his heart he said not a
word. The crossing was smooth. The sea air revived Yvonne’s strength.
"His silence half comforted, half frightened her. Had he relented? She"
"glanced often at his impassive face, in cruel anxiety to pierce to the"
thoughts that lay behind. Yet a little hope came to her; for fear of
losing it she dared not speak. To her simple mind it seemed impossible
that merely conscientious scruples could make him cast her off. If he
"loved her, his love would triumph. If he persisted in his resolve, he"
cared for her no longer. In this case her future was very simple. She
would go back to London and sing.
She seemed to have cried her feeling away during the night--such as he
had left unbruised and untorn. For the quivering flesh is only sensitive
up to a certain point of maceration. He had trodden upon her pitilessly;
"but she felt no resentment. In fact, she would have been quite happy if"
"he had put his arms round her and said, “Let us forget, Yvonne.” By the"
end of the journey she had cajoled herself into the idea that he would
do so.
"""Don't waste your breath on them,"" Boyd advised. ""We're lucky enough as"
"it is. If that tug hadn't sheered off she would have cut us down, sure."""
"""That fellow done it a-purpose,"" George swore. ""Seamen ain't that"
"careless. He tried to tell me he was rattled, but I rattled _him_."""
"""If that's the case they may try it again,"" said the younger man."
"""Huh! I'll pack a 'thirty-thirty' from now on, and I bet they don't get"
"within hailing distance without an iron-clad."""
"The more calmly Emerson regarded the incident, the more he marvelled at"
"the good-fortune that had saved him. ""We had better wake up,"" he said."
"""We have been asleep so far. If Marsh planned this, he will plan"
"something more."""
"""Yes, and if he puts one wallop over we're done for,"" George agreed,"
"pessimistically. ""I'll keep a watchman aboard the scows hereafter."
"That's our vital spot."""
"But the days sped past without further interference, and the"
"construction of the plant progressed by leaps and bounds, while _The"
"Bedford Castle_, having discharged her cargo, steamed away to return in"
August.
"The middle of June brought the first king salmon, scouts sent on ahead"
"of the ""sockeyes;"" but Boyd made no effort to take advantage of this"
"run, laboring manfully to prepare for the advance of the main army,"
"that terrific horde that was soon to come from the mysterious depths,"
"either to make or ruin him. Once the run proper started, there would be"
no more opportunity for building or for setting up machinery. He must
be ready and waiting by the first of July.
knew must be the door. But I couldn't see any knobs or switches to open
it with. Not even a button you could press.
That meant it was a sonic lock like the kind we had on the outer keeps
back home in Undersea. But knock or voice? I tried the two knock
"combinations I knew, and nothing happened. I only remembered one voice"
"key--might as well see if that's it, I figured."
"""Twenty, Twenty-three. Open Sesame."""
"For a second, I thought I'd hit it just right out of all the million"
"possible combinations--The door clicked inward toward a black hole, and"
a hairy hand as broad as my shoulders shot out of the hole. It closed
around my throat and plucked me inside as if I'd been a baby sardine.
I bounced once on the hard lifeboat floor. Before I got my breath and
"sat up, the door had been shut again. When the light came on, I found"
myself staring up the muzzle of a highly polished blaster and into the
cold blue eyes of the biggest man I'd ever seen.
He was wearing a one-piece suit made of some scaly green stuff that
looked hard and soft at the same time.
"His boots were made of it too, and so was the hood hanging down his"
back.
"And his face was brown. Not just ordinary tan, you understand, but the"
"deep, dark, burned-all-the-way-in brown I'd seen on the lifeguards"
in New Orleans whenever we took a surface vacation--the kind of tan
that comes from day after broiling day under a really hot Sun. His
"hair looked as if it had once been blond, but now there were just long"
combed-out waves with a yellowish tinge that boiled all the way down
plaid bicycle cap perched on the back of his head. The lady looked at
"him coolly, without prejudice or favour."
"“Lady,” he said, “dat gent on de oder bench sent yer a song and dance"
"by me. If yer don’t know de guy, and he’s tryin’ to do de Johnny act,"
"say de word, and I’ll call a cop in t’ree minutes. If yer does know"
"him, and he’s on de square, w’y I’ll spiel yer de bunch of hot air he"
sent yer.”
The young lady betrayed a faint interest.
"“A song and dance!” she said, in a deliberate sweet voice that seemed"
to clothe her words in a diaphanous garment of impalpable irony. “A new
"idea—in the troubadour line, I suppose. I—used to know the gentleman"
"who sent you, so I think it will hardly be necessary to call the"
"police. You may execute your song and dance, but do not sing too"
"loudly. It is a little early yet for open-air vaudeville, and we might"
attract attention.”
"“Awe,” said the boy, with a shrug down the length of him, “yer know"
"what I mean, lady. ’Tain’t a turn, it’s wind. He told me to tell yer"
he’s got his collars and cuffs in dat grip for a scoot clean out to
’Frisco. Den he’s goin’ to shoot snow-birds in de Klondike. He says yer
told him not to send ’round no more pink notes nor come hangin’ over de
"garden gate, and he takes dis means of puttin’ yer wise. He says yer"
"refereed him out like a has-been, and never give him no chance to kick"
"at de decision. He says yer swiped him, and never said why.”"
The slightly awakened interest in the young lady’s eyes did not abate.
Perhaps it was caused by either the originality or the audacity of the
"snow-bird hunter, in thus circumventing her express commands against"
the ordinary modes of communication. She fixed her eye on a statue
"blowed ter bits. Oh, it's 'ard when yer've bin together all the time an'"
"shared everythink."""
He buried his face in his hands and made no further sound except an
occasional sniff and a hasty drawing in of the breath through trembling
lips.
"""It's bloody murder up the line,"" said a full Corporal. ""We were in a"
trench four feet deep and up to our waist in water. A Jerry sniper
"spotted us and one man got biffed, [killed] and then the next, and then the"
next all along the trench. We were packed together like sardines and had
no cover at all for our heads and shoulders. I got the wind up terribly
'cause I knew my turn was coming. He only gave me a Blighty though--I
"reckon I'm bloody lucky!"""
"""We was ready for to go over the top an' waitin' for the whistle to"
blow. We didn't 'alf 'ave the wind up. You could 'ear the teeth
"chatterin' all along the trench. I was shiverin' all over, I...."""
"""Next man!"" The conversation stopped while the next man went across, but"
"having once begun to tell their experiences, the men would not stop"
"altogether, and after a brief silence an elderly little man with a"
bandaged foot said:
"""What I couldn't get over was insomnia. I could never sleep at the"
right time and I was always dead tired on duty. Once I worked
forty-three hours at a stretch and after that I had to do a guard in our
trench. I felt sleepy all of a sudden. I pinched myself and banged the
"butt of my rifle on my toes, but everything seemed to swim round me."
"Then, I don't know how, I went off to sleep. I was awakened by an"
officer who shook me and swore at me. I was a bit dazed at first and
then suddenly it struck me what had happened. I never had the wind up so
and I can’t for the life of me see an earthly way of scraping the
money together. Last of all--and worst of all--I haven’t been able to
make a single sale of lumber for the simple reason that the trust has
cut prices below cost and has taken every customer from us. If I cut
to meet them they go lower. You can see that. They’ve got the stock
"and the resources. Crane’s set out to ruin us at any cost, and he’s"
"succeeded. It hurts like sin to say it, boy, but there’s nothing left"
to do but give in and make the best terms we can. Let me hear from you
"at once. Yours ever, John Tweedy."
CHAPTER XI. NO QUITTER
"The letter dropped into Bob’s lap, and for a long minute he sat staring"
"into the yellow, dancing flames. His face was blank, and just a little"
"white, for the blow had been a heavy one, and totally unexpected. He"
"could not seem to understand it. It was unbelievable that he and Tweedy,"
"who had been fair and square in every one of their business dealings,"
could be forced to the wall by such a monster of corruption as Elihu
Crane.
There must be some mistake. Tweedy must have been thrown into one of his
"unjustifiable panics. That was it, of course."
Bob picked up the letter to read it carefully again.
"He perused it to the last word, and then leaned back against the"
"sapling, his face drawn and somber. It really did not sound like a"
"mistake. It was all clear and logical, and singularly cohesive. It was"
the sort of thing Crane would delight in planning and putting into
execution--the cutting of prices on a competitor. Tweedy had written
"that if they attempted to cut under the trust’s present rates, there"
"some sand-bags, trembling all over and feeling as though I was going to"
"choke. I waited for a long time, but nothing happened, so I got up and"
looked round. Lucky escape for us! There's a terrific hole by the Red
Cross and another one behind the bath-house. The third's in the next
field. Only two men hit. O'Neil's got it in the elbow--he's all right
for Blighty. Poor old Hartog's badly hurt--a frightful gash in the thigh
with the piece still in it. I hope he won't have to lose his leg.
"Christ, I'm glad it's all over--I wouldn't like to go through that"
"again."""
"There was silence for a while, but soon the silence was broken by the"
distant muttering of anti-aircraft fire.
"""Jesus Christ Almighty--'e's comin' again--O God, why can't 'e leave us"
"alone."""
We stood outside the marquee and anxiously watched the horizon. We heard
"a faint humming noise. It grew louder and louder until it became a deep,"
droning buzz that rose and fell in regular pulsation. Then
boom--boom--boom--three times the sullen roar of distant explosions
"sounded. Then there came the familiar rushing, whistling noise of a"
descending bomb. We flung ourselves down in the wet grass. I felt every
muscle in my body contract as though I were trying to make myself as
small as a pin point in expectation of the terrible moment. There was a
dull thud close by and I felt the earth vibrate. The bomb had fallen a
"few yards away, but had merely buried itself in the earth without"
exploding.
"There was no anti-aircraft fire, but the droning noise continued loudly,"
"rising and falling. Private Trotter, who was lying beside me, was"
drawing his breath in sharply between his lips. Our fear of impending
disaster was prolonged intolerably. The droning propeller seemed to be
face had lighted at the girl’s words.
"""Methought I had come to a world where naught was dreamed of save"
"fashion and frippery, false adulation and falser scorn.  I am well-nigh"
"stunned by the clamour of tongues, the strife of parties, the bustle of"
"this gay life of fashion."""
"""Oh, and I too—I too!"" breathed the girl softly: and he flashed at her a"
"quick, keen glance of sympathy and interest."
"""I was bred in the country; my grandam brought me up.  I lived with my"
"books, amid silvan solitudes, the songs of birds, the scent of flowers."
This great glittering world of folly and fashion is like a fiery wheel
"going round in my head.  Ofttimes I could cry aloud for mercy, the pain"
and bewilderment are so great.  I know there must be noble men and good
"in this strange Pandemonium; but I know not where to find them, and my"
heart grows sick.  Would that I could go back to my books and my dreams!
"But alas! a maiden may not choose for herself."""
"""Still there is life here,"" spoke Grey quickly, ""and it behoves us to"
know men as well as books.  I have studied both.  I will study them
"again.  I would fain learn all that life has to teach, whether for weal"
or woe.  No hermit-monk was ever truly a man. Yet there be times when
"one shrinks in amaze from all one sees and hears."""
The chord of sympathy was struck.  They passed from one thing to
another.  She found one at last who knew and loved the poets of her
"childhood’s dreams—who could talk of Spenser and Sidney, of Watson,"
"Greville, and Drayton, quoting their verses, and often lighting upon her"
"favourite passages.  Here was a man who knew Milton and Clarendon,"
"Hobbes, Herbert, Lovelace and Suckling, Lord Herbert of Cherbury and"
"Izaak Walton.  He had read eagerly, like herself, poetry and prose,"
"to which, thanks to the Captain's co-operation, he had fallen."
"""Now, then, my friend!"" said the Captain, glancing critically at the"
"restored client, ""we have a coat and jacket.  When I had respectable"
trousers I lived in town like a respectable man.  But when the trousers
"wore out, I too fell off in the opinion of my fellow-men and had to"
"come down here from the town.  Men, my fine mannikin, judge everything"
"by the outward appearance, while, owing to their foolishness, the"
actual reality of things is incomprehensible to them.  Make a note of
"this on your nose, and pay me at least half your debt.  Go in peace;"
"seek, and you may find."""
"""How much do I owe you, Aristid Fomich?"" asks the client, in confusion."
"""One rouble and 70 kopecks....  Now, give me only one rouble, or, if"
"you like, 70 kopecks, and as for the rest, I shall wait until you have"
"earned more than you have now by stealing or by hard work, it does not"
"matter to me."""
"""I thank you humbly for your kindness!"" says the client, touched to the"
"heart.  ""Truly you are a kind man....; Life has persecuted you in"
"vain....  What an eagle you would have been in your own place!"""
The Captain could not live without eloquent speeches.
"""What does 'in my own place' mean?  No one really knows his own place"
"in life, and every one of us crawls into his harness.  The place of the"
"merchant Judas Petunikoff ought to be in penal servitude, but he still"
"walks through the streets in daylight, and even intends to build a"
factory. The place of our teacher ought to be beside a wife and
"half-a-dozen children, but he is loitering in the public-house of"
"Vaviloff.  And then, there is yourself.  You are going to seek a"
was you. I'm so sorry I didn't have a chance to introduce you to mother
this morning. But mother wants me to take you back to the hotel. You
can have a room right next to mine and we'll have scads of fun--You'll
"come, won't you?"" For Sidney's face was unyielding."
"Like one cornered, Sidney stood straight against the table, her hands,"
"red from the hot dish water, clasped tightly behind her back. Though"
she knew that Pola was trying to make amends for her rudeness of the
"morning, something within her heart turned hard. The dusty idol was"
crumbling to bits of clay.
"""She's only inviting me because Mr. Dugald has told her to,"" she"
reasoned inwardly. And aloud she answered in a steady voice:
"""I'm sorry, but I simply can't leave Aunt Achsa. You must come here and"
"we'll find lots of jolly things to do--"""
"""Here?"" laughed Pola, glancing around the old kitchen."
"""Why not here?"" roared Mr. Dugald. ""As long as you've broken into our"
Secret Garden we'll introduce you to some things you've never done
before in your life. Only Sid will have to find some suitable clothes
"for you, and you'd better leave your complexion on the dressing table."""
"Pola accepted his banter good-naturedly. ""I shall be deeply grateful,"
"old dear, if you _will_ introduce me to any sensations I have not"
"experienced before. There, now, will that hold you for awhile?"" She"
"turned to Sidney. ""We quarrel like this all the time, but it's fun and"
I always have the last word. I make him so mad he can't think of
anything withering enough to say and I seize that strategic moment to
"cease firing. You see, I practice on Dug. I _will_ come tomorrow if I"
"may. Now, Duggie dear, lead me out of this funny lane or else I'll"
to prevent me. I had only to lie close among the rocks until Count
"Hugo left, and then I might plod back on foot and search as I pleased."
"In a flash I saw the poplars, and the road running beneath the"
"ash-tree, and the woman's body lying stiff and stark on the sward. And"
I burned to be there.
Left to myself I should have gone too. But the plan was no sooner
"formed than shattered. While I stood, hotfoot to be about it, and"
"pausing only to consider which way I could steal off most safely, a"
"rustling warned me that some one was coming, and before I could stir,"
a burly trooper broke through the bushes and confronted me. He saluted
me stolidly.
"'Sergeant,' he said, 'the general is waiting for you.'"
'The general?' I said.
"'The Count, if you like it better,' he answered. 'Come, if you"
please.'
"I followed him, full of vexation. It was but a step into the road. The"
"moment I appeared, some one gave the word 'Mount!' A horse was thrust"
"in front of me, two or three troopers who still remained afoot swung"
themselves into the saddle; and I followed their example. In a trice
"we were moving down the valley at a dull, steady pace--southwards,"
"southwards. I looked back, and saw the fir trees and rocks where we"
"had lain hidden, and then we turned a corner, and they were gone."
"Gone, and all round me I heard the measured tramp of the troop-horses,"
"the swinging tones of the men, and the clink and jingle of sword and"
"spur. I called myself a cur, but I went on, swept away by the force of"
"numbers, as the straw by the current. Once I caught Count Hugo's eye"
"fixed on me, and I fancied he had a message for me, but I failed to"
"“Fine man,” commented the younger man aloud. “Hope I do run into him"
"again. Meanwhile, however, the rear isn’t coming along half quick"
"enough, and I haven’t seen a darn thing all afternoon of the wangan. I"
hope nothing’s happened to it and the grub. That would be one awful
blow!”
It was one that was spared him. Within half an hour the clumsy scow hove
"in sight. It tied up to the bank a little later, and before dark"
preparations for supper were going on merrily.
Bob did not get in till later. Assured that all was well with the cook
"and his staff, he went on downstream to see how Peters and his gang were"
progressing. On his return he discovered a stranger warming himself by
"the drying fire. He looked like an old-time woodsman, and the instant"
"Bainbridge appeared he was on his feet, extracting an envelope from the"
interior of his hat.
"“From Mr. Tweedy, sir.”"
The young lumberman ripped it open without a premonition of the blow in
store for him. It was natural for Tweedy to write. He would be reporting
"his success in the matter of credit, of course, and probably gloating"
over the amount of manufactured lumber he had sold in so short a time.
Bainbridge noted that it had been written in the Bangor office the night
"before. Then, settling himself by the fire, he proceeded to read:"
"Dear Bobby: It’s all up with us, boy. We’re done, and we may as well"
admit it first as last and make what terms we can with the gang. I
can’t get credit anywhere. Crane’s been ahead of me and spilled the
"beans each time. What’s more, Gastich absolutely refuses to renew that"
"note. Says he must have the cash for some stocks he’s carrying, and"
"all that; but you know what it means. It’s due in less than a week,"
"What HAVE I done?""  No answer came.  And such rage against men flared up"
"that she just stood there, twisting her garden-gloves in her hands, and"
"biting the lips he would have kissed.  Then, going to her bureau, she"
"took up her address book and looked for the name: Wing, 88, Frankland"
"Street, Fulham. Unhooking her little bag from off the back of the chair,"
"she put her cheque-book into it.  Then, taking care to make no sound, she"
"passed into the hall, caught up her sunshade, and went out, closing the"
door without noise.
She walked quickly toward Baker Street.  Her gardening-hat was right
"enough, but she had come out without gloves, and must go into the first"
"shop and buy a pair.  In the choosing of them, she forgot her emotions"
"for a minute.  Out in the street again, they came back as bitterly as"
"ever.  And the day was so beautiful--the sun bright, the sky blue, the"
clouds dazzling white; from the top of her 'bus she could see all its
brilliance.  There rose up before her the memory of the man who had
"kissed her arm at the first ball.  And now--this!  But, mixed with her"
"rage, a sort of unwilling compassion and fellow feeling kept rising for"
"that girl, that silly, sugar-plum girl, brought to such a pass by--her"
husband. These feelings sustained her through that voyage to Fulham.  She
"got down at the nearest corner, walked up a widish street of narrow grey"
houses till she came to number eighty-eight.  On that newly scrubbed
"step, waiting for the door to open, she very nearly turned and fled."
What exactly had she come to do?
The door was opened by a servant in an untidy frock.  Mutton!  The smell
"of mutton--there it was, just as the girl had said!"
"""Is Miss--Miss Daphne Wing at home?"""
"In that peculiar ""I've given it up"" voice of domestics in small"
"households, the servant answered:"
and waited in the field. But this time there were several further
shell-bursts. No dull boom in the distance followed by a long-drawn
"whine, but only the earth and smoke thrown darkly up and then the"
deafening double detonation.
"The next day more shells came over, and the next day also."
The big holes with their earthen rims began to dot the fields in many
"places. No damage of ""military importance"" had been done. Not even a"
"soldier had been killed, but only an inoffensive cow."
"At night the sky was alive with the whirr of propellers, and shells"
whistled overhead and burst a long way off.
"One Sunday, toward the end of March, when we had a half-holiday, I"
walked up the hill that was crowned by a large monastery and sat down
on the slope by a group of sallows. They were in full bloom. A swarm of
bees and flies were buzzing round. Peacock and Tortoiseshell butterflies
were flitting to and fro. The sunlight filtered down through the bluish
haze. I rested and let an hour or two slip by. Then I got up and crossed
a little brook and strolled along a narrow path that wound its way
"through a copse. The ground was starred with wood-anemones, oxlips,"
"violets, cuckoo-flowers, and in damp places with green-golden saxifrage."
I came to a small cottage that had pots of flowers in every window. I
sat down while a hospitable old woman made coffee and chattered volubly
in Flemish. Another soldier arrived soon after. Had I heard the news?
The Germans had broken through on the Somme and had captured Bapaume. I
"asked him if he had seen it in print. No, he had heard it from an A.S.C."
"driver. He hoped it wasn't true, but he feared it was."
I returned to camp full of suppressed excitement.
falls--and over them.
"He took the drop easily, riding the log with that perfect balance which"
is second nature to the seasoned riverman. When the timber bumped
"against the rapidly forming jam, Curly leaped again, thrusting the log"
"down as he did so, and landed on the solid barrier. Scrambling lightly"
"over to the face of this, he thrust deftly with his peavey into the"
"mass, and began to work desperately to loosen the key log--that first"
"upended stick of pine which had started the whole trouble, and which"
must be started before the rest of the barrier would give.
"He got a good hold on it, but the thing defied his efforts to tear it"
"loose. It was wedged too tightly for even his great strength, and,"
"though he seemed to feel it move slightly, he strained his muscles to"
the utmost in vain to accomplish anything further. Presently he
"realized, with a thrill, that the jam was piling up behind him faster"
"and faster. He ceased his efforts, and clamping the peavey on timber"
"above the key log, pried it free, and sent it bobbing downstream."
"Another followed, and another still. Sweat poured in streams from him,"
"trickling blindingly into his eyes, but he did not stop to wipe it away."
"There was no time. He must go on doing his best till help came, or"
else----
A faint jar shook the jam. A second later Curly felt a hand lightly
touch his shoulder. A familiar voice sounded in his ear:
"“Good work, son! Where’s that trouble maker? Oh, I see. Let me drop down"
"to that ledge, where I can get a good hold. That’s the idea. Now grip"
"her above me. Fine! Ready, now? Yank away!”"
"It was Bainbridge--swift, agile, incredibly fresh considering what he"
had accomplished that day. For a moment or two Curly did not realize
were on the other side of the invisible screen.
"Determined however, to remove this invisible screen, I said"
"Good-evening, and it was very cold. They muttered Good-evening, and yes,"
it was fresh. An Italian never says it is cold: it is never more than
_fresco_. But this hint that it was cold they took as a hint at their
"caps, and they became very silent, till the woman came in with the"
"soup-bowl. Then they clamoured at her, particularly the _maialino_, what"
was there to eat. She told them--beef-steaks of pork. Whereat they
"pulled faces. Or bits of boiled pork. They sighed, looked gloomy,"
"cheered up, and said beef-steaks, then."
"And they fell on their soup. And never, from among the steam, have I"
heard a more joyful trio of soup-swilkering. They sucked it in from
"their spoons with long, gusto-rich sucks. The _maialino_ was the"
"treble--he trilled his soup into his mouth with a swift, sucking"
"vibration, interrupted by bits of cabbage, which made the lamp start to"
"dither again. Black-cap was the baritone; good, rolling spoon-sucks. And"
the one in spectacles was the bass: he gave sudden deep gulps. All was
"led by the long trilling of the _maialino_. Then suddenly, to vary"
"matters, he cocked up his spoon in one hand, chewed a huge mouthful of"
"bread, and swallowed it down with a smack-smack-smack! of his tongue"
"against his palate. As children we used to call this ""clapping""."
"""Mother, she's clapping!"" I would yell with anger, against my sister."
The German word is schmatzen.
"So the _maialino_ clapped like a pair of cymbals, while baritone and"
bass rolled on. Then in chimed the swift bright treble.
"At this rate however, the soup did not last long. Arrived the"
beef-steaks of pork. And now the trio was a trio of castanet smacks and
friends and forget all about the army and the war. I would be gay and
"frivolous and go to theatres, music-halls and cafés. And one day I would"
spend in the British Museum and lose myself in books--that would be
"just like old times! Of course, our leave would not last for ever and"
the return journey would be terrible. No doubt the fortnight would pass
"very quickly, but I determined to enjoy every single hour with"
"deliberation and understanding, and to squeeze every drop of pleasure"
out of it. How many hours were there in a fortnight? More than three
"hundred! Many would be wasted in sleep, but still, there would be many"
"left and by dwelling upon each one, the fortnight would seem an age."
*       *       *       *       *
An afternoon and an evening in a train that travelled all too slowly. A
night and half a day at Calais Rest Camp. How terrible was the rankling
impatience that gnawed our hearts as the hours dragged on.
"But at last we were on the leave boat. There was another long delay, and"
"then, with a feeling of immense relief, we heard the engines throb and"
the paddle-wheels begin to turn. I looked overboard and saw white foam
hissing along the surface of water rapidly widening between us and the
quay.
Seventeen months of exile and slavery had come to an end and before us
lay a wonderful fortnight of freedom and happiness. And at the end of
the fortnight? There was no need to think of that now.
The sea was blue and smooth and a cool breeze was blowing. We saw the
cliffs of England grow larger and larger. Soon we were able to
"distinguish the town of Dover, the houses clustered round the harbour,"
and the Castle up on the cliff. It was there that I had begun my career
as a soldier more than two years before. How much had happened since
"Several voices muttered ""Thank God,"" but one man's teeth were still"
chattering as though he was so absorbed by his own fear that he had not
noticed the disappearance of its cause. Soon there was complete silence
and one by one we fell asleep.
Another clear day and another clear night. We lay awake listening
anxiously to the bursting of bombs and the muttering of anti-aircraft
fire. But we went to sleep in the end and felt drowsy all the following
day--a clear day. Casualties came in from a camp that had been bombed
"overnight, and we saw shattered limbs, smashed heads, and lacerated"
flesh. Several of our men were looking pale through lack of sleep and
had dark rings round their eyes.
"Another clear night. The agonizing vigil began again, but I was so weary"
that I went to sleep a few minutes after lights out. Sullen thunders
mingled with my dreams and did not wake me up.
Another clear day. Would the fine weather never end? Late in the
"afternoon, however, a few clouds collected on the horizon. In the"
evening the entire sky was overcast and not a star was to be seen. And
as we went to bed we heard the rain swishing down upon the canvas roof.
The unspeakable joy we all felt at the prospect of an untroubled night!
"""Bloody fine, this rain: we'll get some proper sleep now, thank God. I"
"never had the wind up so much in all my life, and I've been out here"
"since '15 and in some pretty hot places too."""
"""I reckon the longer yer out 'ere the windier yer get. I joined up in"
'14 like a bloody fool. At first I didn't care a damn for anything. Then
I was wounded on the Somme an' sent across to Blighty. I dreaded comin'
"back agin. I only 'ad a little wound in me 'and, an' I used ter plug it"
"wi' dubbin' an' boot-polish ter keep it raw. It didn't 'alf 'urt, but it"
*       *       *       *       *
The train was running over the malarial-looking sea-plain--past the
"down-at-heel palm trees, past the mosque-looking buildings. At a level"
crossing the woman crossing-keeper darted out vigorously with her red
flag. And we rambled into the first village. It was built of sun-dried
"brick-adobe houses, thick adobe garden-walls, with tile ridges to keep"
off the rain. In the enclosures were dark orange trees. But the
"clay-coloured villages, clay-dry, looked foreign: the next thing to mere"
"earth they seem, like fox-holes or coyote colonies."
"Looking back, one sees Cagliari bluff on her rock, rather fine, with the"
thin edge of the sea's blade curving round. It is rather hard to believe
"in the real sea, on this sort of clay-pale plain."
*       *       *       *       *
But soon we begin to climb to the hills. And soon the cultivation begins
"to be intermittent. Extraordinary how the heathy, moor-like hills come"
near the sea: extraordinary how scrubby and uninhabited the great spaces
"of Sardinia are. It is wild, with heath and arbutus scrub and a sort of"
"myrtle, breast-high. Sometimes one sees a few head of cattle. And then"
"again come the greyish arable-patches, where the corn is grown. It is"
"like Cornwall, like the Land's End region. Here and there, in the"
"distance, are peasants working on the lonely landscape. Sometimes it is"
"one man alone in the distance, showing so vividly in his black-and-white"
"costume, small and far-off like a solitary magpie, and curiously"
distinct. All the strange magic of Sardinia is in this sight. Among the
"low, moor-like hills, away in a hollow of the wide landscape one"
"solitary figure, small but vivid black-and-white, working alone, as if"
"eternally. There are patches and hollows of grey arable land, good for"
corn. Sardinia was once a great granary.
soon found it; but there I came to a check. Round the churchyard stood
"a number of quiet family houses, many-gabled and shaded by limes, and"
doubtless once occupied by reverend canons and prebendaries. But no
"one of these held such a position that it could shoulder Herr Krapp's,"
or be by any possibility the house I wanted. The churchyard lay too
far from the street for that.
I walked up the row twice before I would admit this; but at last I
"made it certain. Still Herr Krapp must know his own premises, and not"
"much cast down, I was going to knock at a chance door and put the"
"question, when my eyes fell on a man who sat at work in the"
"churchyard. He wore a mason's apron, and was busily deepening the"
inscription on a tablet let into the church wall. He seemed to be the
"very man to know, and I went to him."
"'I want a house which looks into the Neu Strasse,' I said. 'It is the"
next house to Herr Krapp's. Can you direct me to the door?'
"He looked at me for a moment, his hammer suspended. Then he pointed to"
"the farther end of the row. 'There is an alley,' he said in a hoarse,"
croaking voice. 'The door is at the end.'
"I thought his occupation an odd one, considering the state of the"
"city; but I had other things to dwell on, and hastened off to the"
"place he indicated. Here, sure enough, I found the mouth of a very"
"narrow passage which, starting between the last house and a blind"
"wall, ran in the required direction. It was a queer place, scarcely"
"wider than my shoulders, and with two turns so sharp that I remember"
wondering how they brought their dead out. In one part it wound under
"the timbers of a house; it was dark and somewhat foul, and altogether"
so ill-favoured a path that I was glad I had brought my arms.
"""Lady, you have asked a hard question, inasmuch as I know but little of"
"the man, albeit I have lived with him above a month.  He attracts me,"
and yet there be moments when he repels me too.  He is a good friend—I
would not speak a word against him; yet it is said that he can be a
bitter and an unscrupulous enemy; and those who have lost his favour
"withdraw themselves as speedily as possible from his notice, fearful"
"lest some evil may befall them."""
"""Is he then cruel and rancorous?"""
"""I can believe that he might be, were his passions roused.  He has that"
forceful nature which tends to vehement liking and bitter hatred.  I
"have experienced the one; I have not tasted of the other.  For the rest,"
"he is a man of parts, and can do all well to which he puts his hand."
Methinks he would be strong enough to break off his reckless and vicious
"habits, had he but motive sufficient to make him! desire to do so.  But"
"for the nonce he floats with the current, and lives as the world lives."
"More I cannot say."""
"At that moment a swift, firm tread was heard approaching along the dim"
"alley; and Geraldine looked hastily round, her hand dropping from Grey’s"
arm.
"""It is he!"" she whispered, and there was a catch in her voice which the"
"young man heard without understanding.  He faced round, and beheld the"
towering figure of Lord Sandford beside them.
"""Well chanced upon!"" quoth he in his resonant tones.  ""I was sent by"
"your mother in search of you, Lady Geraldine.  The court of beauty has"
sat.  To her has been adjudged the prize.  She now desires the presence
"of her daughter, to share her triumph. We shall sup anon, and the table"
will not be complete without one gracious and lovely presence. Lady
"courage, I think we should have stayed there till daylight, and been"
caught like birds limed on a bough.
"As it was, we plunged and strove for more than an hour in that place,"
"the dark sky above us, the quaking bog below, the women's weeping in"
"our ears. Then, at last, when I had almost given up hope, we struggled"
"out one by one upon the road, and stood panting and shaking,"
astonished to find solid ground under our feet. We had still two miles
"to walk, but on dry soil; and though at another time the task might"
"have seemed to the women full of adventure and arduous, it failed to"
frighten them after what we had gone through. Steve took Fraulein
"Anna, and I one of the women. My lady and the Waldgrave went hand in"
"hand; the one giving, I fancy, as much help as the other. For Marie,"
"her small, white face was a beacon of hope in the darkness. In the"
marsh she had never failed or fainted. On the road the tears came into
my eyes for pity and love and admiration.
"At length Steve bade us stand, and leaving us in the way, plunged into"
"the denser blackness of a thicket, which lay between it and the river."
"I heard him parting the branches before him, and stumbling and"
"swearing, until presently the sounds died away in the distance, and we"
remained shivering and waiting. What if the horses were gone? What if
they had strayed from the place where he had tethered them early in
"the day, or some one had found and removed them? The thought threw me"
into a cold sweat.
"Then I heard him coming back, and I caught the ring of iron hoofs. He"
"had them! I breathed again. In a moment he emerged, and behind him a"
string of shadows--five horses tied head and tail.
'Quick!' he muttered. He had been long enough alone to grow nervous.
"'We are two hours gone, and if they have not yet discovered him they"
"body into which we may be born. It is the first duty of a monk, of him"
"who is trying to lead the purer life, to kill all these affections, or"
rather to blend them into one great compassion to all the world alike.
"'Gayüna,' compassion, that is the only passion that will be left to"
us. So say the learned.
"I met a little girl not long ago, a wee little maiden about seven years"
"old, and she told me all about her former life when she was a man. Her"
"name was Maung Mon, she said, and she used to work the dolls in a"
travelling marionette show. It was through her knowledge and partiality
"for marionettes that it was first suspected, her parents told me, whom"
she had been in her former life. She could even as a sucking-child
manipulate the strings of a marionette-doll. But the actual discovery
"came when she was about four years old, and she recognised a certain"
"marionette booth and dolls as her own. She knew all about them, knew"
"the name of each doll, and even some of the words they used to say in"
"the plays. 'I was married four times,' she told me. 'Two wives died, one"
"I divorced; one was living when I died, and is living still. I loved her"
"very much indeed. The one I divorced was a dreadful woman. See,'"
"pointing to a scar on her shoulder, 'this was given me once in a"
quarrel. She took up a chopper and cut me like this. Then I divorced
her. She had a dreadful temper.'
It was immensely quaint to hear this little thing discoursing like this.
"The mark was a birth-mark, and I was assured that it corresponded"
exactly with one that had been given to the man by his wife in just such
a quarrel as the one the little girl described.
The divorced wife and the much-loved wife are still alive and not yet
old. The last wife wanted the little girl to go and live with her. I
asked her why she did not go.

All the stations so far had had wire netting over the windows. This
means malaria-mosquitoes. The malaria climbs very high in Sardinia. The
"shallow upland valleys, moorland with their intense summer sun and the"
"riverless, boggy behaviour of the water breed the pest inevitably. But"
"not very terribly, as far as one can make out: August and September"
being the danger months. The natives don't like to admit there is any
"malaria: a tiny bit, they say, a tiny bit. As soon as you come to the"
_trees_ there is no more. So they say. For many miles the landscape is
"moorland and down-like, with no trees. But wait for the trees. Ah, the"
woods and forests of Gennargentu: the woods and forests higher up: no
malaria there!
"The little engine whisks up and up, around its loopy curves as if it"
were going to bite its own tail: we being the tail: then suddenly dives
over the sky-line out of sight. And the landscape changes. The famous
"woods begin to appear. At first it is only hazel-thickets, miles of"
"hazel-thickets, all wild, with a few black cattle trying to peep at us"
out of the green myrtle and arbutus scrub which forms the undergrowth;
"and a couple of rare, wild peasants peering at the train. They wear the"
"black sheepskin tunic, with the wool outside, and the long stocking"
caps. Like cattle they too peer out from between deep bushes. The myrtle
"scrub here rises man-high, and cattle and men are smothered in it. The"
big hazels rise bare above. It must be difficult getting about in these
parts.
"Sometimes, in the distance one sees a black-and-white peasant riding"
"lonely across a more open place, a tiny vivid figure. I like so much the"
proud instinct which makes a living creature distinguish itself from its
background. I hate the rabbity khaki protection-colouration. A
"black-and-white peasant on his pony, only a dot in the distance beyond"
"""Ah!"" cried the girl, laying her hand again on his cuff, ""that is"
because they do not wish you to share their plunder. But tell them that
you care nothing for that and they will welcome you readily enough. The
"place is plague-stricken, I tell you. The palace lies open. Little"
crook-backed Chepe brought me word. He says he adores me. He is of the
"village of Frias, back there behind the hills. I do not love him, even"
"though he has a bitter heart and can hate well. Therefore I suffer him."""
The Sergeant rose to his feet and looked compassionately down at the
"vivid little figure before him. The hair, dense and black, the blue"
"eyes, the red-knotted handkerchief, the white teeth that showed between"
the parted lips clean and sharp as those of a wild animal. Cardono had
"seen many things on his travels, but never anything like this. His soul"
"was moved within him. In the deeps of his heart, the heart of a Spanish"
"gipsy, there was an infinite sympathy for any one who takes up the blood"
"feud, who, in the face of all difficulties, swears the _vendetta_. But"
"the slim arms, the spare willowy body, the little white sandalled feet"
of the little girl--these overcame him with a pitifully amused sense of
the disproportion of means to end.
"""Have you no brother, Señorita?"" he said, using by instinct the title of"
respect which the little girl loved the most. She saw his point in a
moment.
"""A brother--yes, Don José! But my brother is a cur, a dog that eats"
offal. Pah! I spit upon him. He hath taken favours from the woman. He
hath handled her money. He would clean the shoes they twain leave at
their chamber door. A brother--yes; the back of my hand to such
brothers! But after to-night he shall have no offal to eat--no bones
thrown under the table to pick. For in one slaying I will kill the
"Italian woman Cristina, the man Muñoz who broke my mother's heart, and"
the foisted changeling brat whom they miscall the daughter of Fernando
for ever. But I _wouldn't_ think about it. I _would_ enjoy the present.
But the calm waters of happiness had been ruffled and it was beyond my
"power to restore their tranquillity. I began to think of many things, of"
"the war itself, of the possible offensive, and soon the fretful"
"rebellious discontent, that obsessed all those of us who had not lost"
"their souls, began to reassert itself."
But why not desert? Why not escape to the south of France? Why not enjoy
"a week, a fortnight, a month of freedom? I would be caught in the end--I"
"would be punished. I would receive Number 1 Field Punishment, and I"
"would be tied to a wheel or post, but nevertheless it would be worth"
it! I imagined myself slipping out of camp at night and walking until
"dawn. Then I would sleep in some wood or copse and then walk on again,"
calling at remote farms to buy bread and eggs and milk. I would reach
"the little village, the main street winding between white houses and"
flooded with brilliant moonlight. I would climb the wall and drop into
the familiar garden and await the morning. Then I would knock at the
"door and I would be welcomed by an old peasant woman, and she would ask:"
"""Tu viens en perme?"" How could I answer that question? It worried me, I"
felt it was spoiling my dream. But I dreamt on and at the same time
battled against increasing depression. Even a few days of freedom would
"be a break, a change from routine. And would the little village be the"
"same as when I saw it last? No, it would be different, it would be at"
"war. I might escape from the army, but I could never escape from the"
war. My dream had vanished.
But I _would_ make the best of things. I _would_ enjoy the immediate
present--was I not losing hours of sheer pleasure by harbouring these
thoughts and ignoring the beauty of the day?
Some distance ahead was a farm of the usual Flemish type--a thatched
"roof, whitewashed walls, and green shutters. Near by was a little pond"
another without a word spoken. There was no sign of surprise or fear
"in his face, just a queer little smile. Suddenly he moved, made a"
"snatch at the front of his overalls, and put something into his mouth."
"I guessed what it was, but did not try to stop him; it was the best"
"thing that he could do."""
Dawson stopped and pulled savagely at his cigar. He jabbed the end
"with his knife, though the cigar was drawing perfectly well, and gave"
forth a deep growl which might have been a curse or a sob.
"""Have you ever watched an electric bulb fade away when the current is"
"failing?"" he asked. ""The film pales down from glowing white to dull"
"red, which gets fainter and fainter, little by little, till nothing"
but the memory of it lingers on your retina. His eyes went out exactly
"like that bulb. They faded and faded out of his face, which still kept"
"up that queer, twisted smile. I've seen them ever since; wherever I"
"turn. I shall be glad of that bout of influenza, and shall begin it"
with a stiff dose of veronal.... When the light had nearly gone out of
"his eyes and he was rocking on his feet, I spoke for the first time. I"
"spoke loud too. 'Good-bye,' I called out; 'I'm Dawson.' He heard me,"
for his eyes answered with a last flash; then they faded right out and
he fell flat on the steel deck. He had died on his feet; his will kept
"him upright to the end; that was a Man. He lived a Man's life, doing"
"what he thought his duty, and he died a Man's death.... I blew my"
whistle twice; up clattered a Sergeant with the Marine Guard and
stopped where that figure on the deck barred their way. 'Get a
"stretcher,' I said, 'and send for the doctor. But it won't be any use."
"The man's dead.' The Sergeant asked sharply for my report, and sent"
"off a couple of men for a stretcher. 'Excuse me, Sergeant,' I said, in"
"my best detective officer voice, 'I will report direct to your Major"
and the Commander. I am Chief Inspector Dawson.' He showed no surprise
"nor doubt of my word--if you want to understand discipline, gentlemen,"
"little relieved, but drowsiness came on again. I fought against it with"
"all my strength, but with an agony no words can describe I realized that"
it was too strong for me. I pulled myself together with another
despairing effort. I noticed that my clothing felt cold and clammy--I
"had been sweating all over...."""
"The theatre orderly burst into the waiting-room and shouted: ""Are you"
"all deaf? I've been yelling out 'Next man' the last five minutes, but"
you won't take no bloody notice. Send us two or three. The Colonel's in
"the theatre--he'll kick up a hell of a row if you don't get a move on."""
"We were scared and sent three men across. When they had gone, we asked"
to hear the end of the story.
"""Well, I was absolutely desperate. I kept on looking at my watch, but"
"the minutes crawled along. I believe I must have started crying once,"
"but I don't know for certain, I was so sleepy that I don't remember half"
"of what I did and what I dreamt--I know I did dream, it's funny how you"
can start dreaming even when you're standing up or moving about. I
couldn't keep my eyes open and I kept on dropping off and pulling myself
"together. Suddenly, there was a terrific crash and a shell burst, it"
"must have been forty or fifty yards off. I thought, bitterly, that"
"there'd be no Blighty for me--no such luck. Then, high up in the air, I"
"saw a big shell-fragment sailing along in a wide curve, spinning and"
"turning. I looked at it--it was coming my way--Jesus Christ, perhaps I'd"
have some luck after all--and in any case a few more seconds would have
"passed by. It descended like a flash, I started back in spite of myself"
and held one hand out in front of my face. I felt a kind of numb pain in
"my right foot--nothing very bad. I looked down and, oh joy, I saw a big,"
"jagged bit of shell imbedded in my foot. I tried to move it, but the"
"pain was too great. Joy seemed to catch me by the throat, I began to"
"dance, but such a pang shot through my leg that I had to stop. I dropped"
"""We must take the rough and the smooth of life as we find it,"" answered"
"the other.  ""I have had my moments of rebellion—I have them still; but I"
seek the consolations of philosophy; and I have never yet wanted for
bread or shelter.  But there be times when the future looks dark before
"me.  Those who remember me, and pity my misfortunes, drop away one by"
one.  I lacked not for patrons at the first. When I could not longer
"tread the boards, I was ofttimes engaged to make men laugh or weep at"
"some gay rout at a nobleman’s house.  Then, too, my jests and quips were"
"in request at gay supper-parties, and I was paid to set the table in a"
"roar, which in all sooth was not difficult when the wine-bottle was"
"going round and round.  Oh, I knew gay times for many a year after my"
stage career closed. But patrons have died off one by one.  I am more
"crippled than I was, and the young wits are pushing to the front, whilst"
the Old Lion has been crowded out.  My pen still serves me in a measure.
"I can turn an epigram, or write a couplet, or even make shift to pen a"
"sonnet that lacks not the true ring.  Grist yet comes to the mill, but"
more and more slowly.  There come moments when I wonder what will be the
"end of the Old Lion’s career—the poorhouse, or a death by slow"
"starvation in some garret!"""
"""No, no,"" cried Grey almost fiercely; ""that would be shame indeed."
"Surely, if nothing better turn up, there must be places of refuge for"
"fallen genius. Have not almshouses been built, again and again, by the"
"well-disposed for such men as sickness has laid aside?  You smile, but"
"in sooth it is so."""
"""Ay, and how many are there to claim the benefits of pious founders?"
"Yet no matter.  I brought you not here to talk of my troubles, but of"
"yours.  That romance of which you speak—"""
"""It would seem the world cares little for such things.  I did hear the"
"same tale everywhere.  Was it a pamphlet I had to give them, a lampoon"
"killed in an accident, and that was some consolation to me. And the next"
morning--I can't bear to think of it--nothing happened: that was just
the terrible thing about it--nothing happened. The day passed and then
"another day. At times I longed to be taken out and shot, and once or"
twice I felt I didn't care about anything. I didn't care whether I died
or not. A week passed and then another week. I don't know how I lived
"through it. Then, one day, I was told to pack up and rejoin my unit. I"
"don't know exactly what I did, but I think I must have gone hysterical."
I remember some N.C.O. saying I ought to stay a bit because I wasn't
well enough to go up the line. He said he'd speak to the officer and get
me a few days' rest. But the thought of staying in that place made me
shiver. I said I was absolutely all right and went back to my unit.
"""But I never found out what had happened--you see, I was only a common"
"soldier, so they didn't trouble to tell me--until I got a letter from"
the Captain who was in charge of me when I was on that forty-three hour
job. He said he'd heard I was in for a court martial for sleeping when
"on guard, so he wrote to our headquarters to tell them I'd worked"
forty-three hours on end and wasn't fit to do a guard after a spell like
that. Then they must have made a lot of inquiries--I expect there's a
"whole file of papers about me at headquarters. Anyhow, that's how I got"
"off--it's more than a month ago now. Well, yesterday morning I was put"
"on guard again. I tried to get out of it, but the officer said I was"
swinging the lead and he wouldn't listen to any excuses. I told him I'd
had insomnia overnight and could hardly keep my eyes open. I said I'd do
"anything rather than a guard--a fatigue job or a patrol, no matter how"
"dangerous, as long as it kept me on the move. The very thought of doing"
a guard made me tremble all over. He swore at me and said he'd heard
"these tales before and told me to shut up and get on with it. Well, I"
had to stand in the trench in front of a steel plate with holes in it
through which I had to peer. It was just about daybreak. There was a
tree growing about fifty yards off. It had been knocked about pretty

What?
Sharks?
Ariel!
"[Grunts] Ariel, I can't..."
I mean...
"- Ariel, help!"
- [Laughs]
"- Oh, Flounder."
- [Whispers] Ariel.
Do you really think there might be sharks around here?
"Flounder, don't be such a guppy."
I'm not a guppy. [grunts]
This is great.
"I mean, I really love this."
"Excitement, adventure, danger lurking around every corner... [screams] Ariel!"
"[Grunts] Oh, are you OK?"
"Yeah, sure."
No problem.
I'm OK.
Shh!
"Oh, my gosh."
"Oh, my gosh!"
Have you ever seen anything so wonderful in your entire life?
Wow!
Cool!
"But, uh, what is it?"
"I don't know, but I bet Scuttle will."
-He's fine.
Look.
Here's your ball!
Get your ball!
Get your ball!
Get..
Of course.
You don't want a tennis ball.
Not when you can have a meatball.
"Come on, get the meatball."
"God, what have I done to you?"
"I broke the dog, Pheebs!"
I broke the dog!
Thanks.
I'm going to pick up Mona.
What are you doing tonight?
"Oh, I got big Valentine's plans."
"I got my Chinese food on the way, and your saltwater taffy."
"Interestingly, it isn't made with seawater.."
We actually watched the documentary together.
"Oh, my Chinese food."
I'll get my cash.
Mona?
What are..?
Hi!
How are you?
I'm supposed to pick you up.
I made you a Valentine's dinner.
Surprise!
-Oh!
"Hey, Mona!"
"-Hi, Rachel."
- Talkative.
- Mm-hmm.
- Rambling.
Is that a problem?
People sometimes talk more when they're afraid.
Helps compensate for the fear.
"- Masks it, too."
"- Oh, yeah?"
Similar to when you've got the TV on late at night.
The voices make you feel less alone.
Even though you are alone.
"You aren't scaring me, Katie."
Pity.
Is there like a refrigerator here?
There's some snacks in the cupboard.
Alrighty.
"Eenie meenie, miney..."
Mo!
Alright.
"Okay, ginger snaps."
Let's see.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
This'll do.
Now... um...
"He's gonna be right behind this door when I close it, isn't he?"
"Yeah, that's how this works."
Knew it.
Jump scares get pretty old...
Fuck!
"Oh, God."
- What the hell is that?
- What do you see?
I just have no idea what element goes there.
"Okay, Michelangelo, but we have to close our eyes to match the photo."
So you're the timekeeper.
Well- (SCOFFS)
"Yeah, dude, it's 7:59."
Just go ahead.
"Well, how long do we do it for?"
"10, 15 seconds?"
I'll tell you when to stop.
Just go.
(EXHALES)
I'll be thinking about my boyfriend.
Sweet.
Threesome.
"(SCOFFS) Come here, asshole."
(GASPS) Oh!
Of course.
"Oh, geez, did you guys-"
Hey!
(GASPS)
(DOOR SLAMS) Shit.
- Finn.
- Go get Jasper.
I just wanted to- Go get Jasper!
"- Finn, I'm sorry."
- Who is this?
That's my bookie.
Ivan.
The guy you're always talking on the phone to?
What is he doing in the apartment?
- I don't know.
- Is that normal?
Cheng Tachwan?
(dramatic music)
"Sir, these men."
Are you Cheng Tachwan?
"Sure, what is it?"
A search.
A search?
What's wrong?
Search.
"[Guard] Hey kiddo, you got a visitor."
Lun Taichen.
Go get some money.
Go into town quickly.
Do something to get me out of this place.
I'm innocent.
"Boss, selling drugs is serious, it's hard to fix."
What's more...
You see?
You are completely broke.
"In fact, you owe over $4,000."
You!
(laughing)
"You, you, son of a bitch!"
"Lun Taichen, you're a bastard."
You betrayed me!
"Madame, won't you?"
(laughing)
(plate crashing)
Really?
Cheng Tachwan was my father.
"I was young then, studying in Tensen."
And now.
It's Hendrix!
Ah!
No!
No!
I gotta get outta here!
"Hey, have you seen the Sheriff?"
Oh!
"Oh, my gosh."
"- Hey, what are you doin'?"
"- Get a good peek, city boy?"
I just need my daily gas ration from the Sheriff.
Wait for him at Flo's.
Get outta here.
I've been trying to get outta here for three days!
Hope you enjoyed the show!
"Whoa, Doc."
"Time to clean out the garage, buddy, come on."
What?
He has a Piston Cup?
"Oh, my gosh."
Three Piston Cups?
Sign says stay out.
You have three Piston Cups.
How could you have...
I knew you couldn't drive.
I didn't know you couldn't read.
- You're the Hudson Hornet!
"- Wait at Flo's, like I told ya!"
Of course.
I can't believe I didn't see it before.
You're The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!
You used to hold the record for most wins in a season.
Like when you shut it off.
- Jeff Schultz.
Where's your diver?
- He fell off.
Open it up.
"Stand back, please."
Shot in the heart.
Small caliber.
Been in the water 48 hours.
Less. 24 hours.
She's been dead 48 though.
Somebody held on to her a while.
- Who's this guy?
- Tom Hardy.
- Tom Hardy?
- The infamous.
- Uncle Nick.
- How are you?
- How come you never call me?
"- I call, you're always busy."
- Danny's back.
- Where was he all this time?
"California, some place."
- What did he say?
- Nothing much.
You know Danny.
- How are the treating you at work?
- Good.
I read that Rossmore is retiring.
Are you gonna be the next chief?
"Not me, kid."
I'm just a Larimer Avenue dego.
I'll revive the whole thing right.
"Now, watch-- here."
"That was the beach, right?"
-ALL:
Right.
-Okay.
This was Hill 405 right here.
I'll tell you why.
Zeke...
"All right, this was zero hour."
This is the way it went.
Everybody in posi...
"Gunther, in position?"
"-Right, sir."
-All right.
What are you doing there?
You're with the artillery.
"-Get over there, Tubby!"
"-All right, all right."
"Morgan, get behind the foxhole."
"Zeke, you got the bazookas ready?"
"-All set, all set."
-Now... wait a minute.
Then there came that air...
air raid!
-Air raid!
-Get in position.
(mimicking machine gun sounds)
You got him!
All right.
All right.
Set your watches.
"You know, we are a team today."
Jin.
- Male said something yet?
"- Jin-san, Yankee is not responding."
"I have a bad feeling, we must go up immediately."
Ram!
The joints... are not moving...
There's another GUNK.
Take cover!
Gimlet!
Deploy the launchers!
Male!
Are you hurt?
Ram's suit is freeze.
Smoke!
Male!
Wait!
Even if you launch them here...
Discharge! Ram!
Damn it!
Gimlet!
Where's Ram?
Was evaporated...
Gimlet!
We have signal from the UAV camera.
Yankee!
Yankee!
Are you alive?
Yankee!
Jin here.
I just snaked behind.
Use the EMP grenades!
I'm going up.
Right.
"Oh, I'm coming now."
[Wind howling]
[Seagulls screeching]
Janet?
- Janet!
-Hmm?
The sun is out again.
[Janet groans]
"[Sighs] Oh, good."
Oh.
It's so gorgeous.
Everything smells so fresh after the storm.
We seem to have escaped relatively unscathed.
"Oh, the buddleia's knocked about a bit, though."
The tide was quite high last night.
Yes.
What's that?
"Janet, quick, come here."
What's that?
At the end of the beach.
That black thing?
- I can't see it.
- There ... there.
Oh.
"Oh, dear."
I think it's a body.
I'll telephone Pendered.
[Ursula]:
Where do you think he's gone?
I don't know.
Idiot.
-Guess what?
What?
It carries more fish than penguin that any existed.
In-land.
-And he's amazing ...
Impressive ...
-Sven?
What?
Is anyone down there very special.
"If I know Gloria, she will not eat until everyone eat."
Can you take this for her?
"Yes, do not be silly, where is he?"
"No, she."
"Ali, surrounded by children."
-That is your wife?
-Yes.
Really?
-Yes.
-Your wife?
"Yes, take the fish."
"No, no, no."
She deserves the best.
-Want to hear a song?
Do not.
Let's listen to a song.
I expect before leaving.
Why not plan stay out.
Wake me before leaving.
Will you shut up.
Shut up!
I'llneverletyou  norwillIdisappointyou
- [sighs]
- Mm.
- Ahh.
- [sighs]
Look...
I think you're so great.
Ah.
But I just broke up with Bill...
- Right. [clears throat] - ...and I got all this
"""Girls Are Funny, Too"" stuff happening..."
- Right.
- ...and Goldie's actually letting me do a rewrite of one of the sketches.
"Oh, wow."
Congratulations.
"Thank you, so it's just-- man, it's just-- it's really bad timing for me right now."
"Timing, right."
So...
is there any chance we could just be friends?
Of course.
[laughs]
"Yeah, yeah."
"- Okay, good."
"- Yeah, friends."
"- I'll see you later, friend."
- All right.
Oof.
Hey.
"Missed your time, Sull."
"By ten minutes, just put me up next."
- Sorry.
- Who's here?
Booked until 1:45.
"All right, get up."
"I'm awfully sorry, sir."
I made the mistake.
I press this button.
Same mistake.
(SINGING IN FRENCH)
"Pardon moi, monsieur."
I'm a wee bit nervous.
(CONTINUES SINGING)
Just relax.
BARBER:
"Now, monsieur, the egg."
(BARBER SCATTING)
(SINGING IN FRENCH)
(CONTINUES SINGING)
"(IN FRENCH ACCENT) Oh, pardon, monsieur."
"Oh, I am so sorry."
I make the mistake.
"I am sorry, sir."
Please forgive me.
I am...
"Oh, please..."
I didn't come here for breakfast!
"Now, let's forget the whole thing!"
Forget it!
"Just relax, sir."
Here.
Forget it!
This button will make you relax.
"(MACHINE WHIRRING) No, it's all right."
Will you stop this?
How do you stop this?
He's a good photographer.
"Come on, hurry up!"
Stand closer.
"Look at me, and don't move."
Give me a smile.
Almost done.
Almost there.
Ready.
Bastard!
Do you want to die?
How dare you bother Brother Koon!
"Lucky you're with Sifu Tam, or I'd have broken your hands!"
"Get lost, now!"
Go!
"Auntie, get me a cup of tea."
Husband... run!
"Sister Ping, are you free later?"
- Let's go for supper.
- Really?
- Of course.
- You're lying.
- Big Mouth!
- You always lie to me.
"No, read this."
Big Mouth is... is...
"Sister Ping, what are the two characters under ""Big Mouth""?"
- Something nice about me?
"- Yeah. ""Like a tortoise""."
How dare you make fun of me!
- Help!
- Stop!
Stop!
- I'm clean!
"- If I do, you know what happens."
- Yeah.
I said I'm clean.
Get off!
I'll break your motherfuckin' ass!
Give me a nickel.
Give me a nickel.
Come on!
I told you I'm clean.
What the fuck you wanna come down on me like that for?
This is goddamn full of shit.
- How's everything?
"- Everything's everything, baby."
There's nothin' out there.
It's all milk.
- There ain't nothin' around.
Nobody's holdin'.
- I got a name for you.
Sal Boca.
Brooklyn.
- Boca?
- Yeah.
B-O-C-A.
- Never heard of him.
- What about his wife Angie?
Doesn't register.
"There's been some talk, though."
- About what?
- A shipment.
"Comin' in this week, the week after."
Everybody's gonna get well.
"Tony, unstack the gold bars and deliver them to Mr. Sickle."
"Move it buddy, move it."
We gotta get out of here!
"Las Vegas, here we come."
Look.
"Come on, follow me."
"Tony, make them go faster."
Watch out!
"Hey, Letha!"
"Hey, Letha!"
"Look out, lady."
"Yeah, why don't you watch where you're going, you big dummy."
"Look out, Eddie!"
"Tony, what's happening?"
Molecular flow reversing.
- Are you doing this?
- No.
Then who is?
It would have to be one of my people.
- There are more like you?
- Yes.
- Let's get out of here.
- Tony!
Tony!
Who's that?
It's my sister.
"My sister, Tia."
This is no time for a family reunion.
Letha!
Tony!
You fool!
How could you do this?
That's mine.
This is so sad.
Really sad.
You're right.
It's... sad.
We've reduced ourselves
To animals.
That's what we are.
"Yeah, a bunch of dumb ass,"
Animal house frat boys.
Morons.
Morons might be a bit harsh.
No.
Morons is right.
"Cause all of the porno tapes,"
"The dvds, are up in the"
Bunk room.
Son of a bitch.
What in the hell happened
To him?
"Man, he must have taken the"
White pills.
The sleeping pills.
He's totally dead to the
World.
What kind were they?
Somunall.
Somunall?
"Goddamn, Tommy."
Those are the pills that have
Been in the newspaper.
"I know, I know."
(CHILDREN SHOUTING GLEEFULLY)
I just wanted to do something different.
Yeah.
"Well, it's definitely different."
(BOTH CHUCKLE)
You don't like it?
"No, I like it."
I like it a lot.
"I'm just surprised, that's all."
"What's goin' on, Tris?"
Nothin'.
I'm fine.
Just...
Still having nightmares?
No.
We're good.
You and me.
I know nothing else is.
But we are.
WOMAN ON PA:
"Good morning, and have a blessed day."
(SIGHS)
Time for chores.
"WOMAN""."
"All planters, report to the dome."
All planters to the dome.
(TRIS LAUGHING)
TRIS:
"How much longer do we have to stay here, Four?"
FOUR:
Until we know it's safe to leave.
FOUR:
If you hire me--
"Thank you, Marva!"
I really need this job.
"You're a deportee, aren't you?"
It's complicated--
"Marva, please, I'm afraid I can't hire a criminal."
"No, I'm... ♪"
"Yes, dear, do have those colours for me?"
"Oh, this is beautiful, this is what I had in mind..."
"So, you can take this one to the front, this one to the back... ♪"
"Yo, cous--"
"You sure about this, man?"
"Yo, brethren, don't worry yourself, mon."
Ya understand?
"Yeah, mon, you're good."
"Yo, is this that same dude?"
Eh?
"Yeah man, yeah man-"
- Three times!
"Oh, cool."
"Hey, you know what?"
"This place has got that New York flavour, man."
Jammix--
Yeah?
What happened?
We thought you was in Florida.
"Well, you know what they say--"
"Yeah, of course."
"Yo, Mr. Carlson."
Mr. C!
Mmm Mmm.
We can't do it.
"Let's go, it's just a short trip to Rome."
"Yes, Sgt, your platoon too."
Let's go!
The 5th Army marches over Rome.
You take Cap.
Malaparte and Cap.
Wren.
"Captain, it seems we've made it without the queen of the skies."
- What happened?
- She went back to the USA.
"Malaparte, you're a genius."
"Is this my transport, Colonel?"
"Yes, General, take your seat here."
"Gen. Howes, sit on the other side."
Cap.
"Malaparte, there's your jeep."
"You too, Cap."
Wren.
"And you, General, there's your jeep."
"Well, Sir, that's it."
"Good job, Colonel."
"General, I'd like to shake your hand."
Sic iter ad astra!
What?
That's the way to the stars.
"Well, let's go."
Tempus fugit!
"Yes, Sir!"
This is a page in history.
Is Rome really like this?
"Yes, that's 'the' Rome."
I always thought it was a city.
- Come on.
"- Come on, gang."
- Wait--
"Come on, come on, out this way."
- Yeah?
- Message from Mr. Thompson.
"You killed him, huh?"
Get the essentials out of there.
"Come on, get those guys out of here."
Get them out of here.
"Now, I'm going to Peakstown to get Dr. Loring to sign the death certificate."
You phone him and tell him I'll be there in 15 minutes.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello--
The line is dead.
Hello.
"All right, use the one in your office."
Every man in this room is under arrest.
Stand where you are.
"You, come on."
Start walking.
Come on.
Get going.
Come on.
- Who's there?
- Mike.
- Patsy.
"- Oh, sweet."
I had to bring her.
"I made him bring me, darling."
I had to see you.
Who needs to know the truth.
Will you do something for me?
Get my father to do something for me?
"I love you, dad."
"And I love you, mom."
Devalos  arianna:
"""you both gave me so much love,"
"""and I'm taking that with me wherever I'm going."
"Devalos : ""now you'll need to give it to each other."
"""goodbye, daddy."
"""goodbye, mommy."
I love you.
"Arianna."""
A Hannah Special's here once more.
Doo dah doo dah.
You won't believe what is in store.
Oh the doo dah day.
Secrets and romance.
I'll even do a dance.
[Rico grunting]
-Rico!
-Rico!
Sorry.
We'll be here to help you through.
Doo dah doo dah.
"Me, the dork, his girlfriend, too."
Oh the doo dah day.
Don't call me a dork.
He's mad 'cause we're in love.
"I was mad, but now I'm glad to give this friendly shove."
"-Hey, don't shove him!"
Did I just say hung?
Hang.
Let's hang each other!
Sure.
We could go to Eddie's tonight.
"Sparkle, I'll see you there!"
Cool!
[cackling]
"What up, fam?"
"I was all, like, ""Yo, babe, you and me, tonight."""
"She was all, like, ""Oh, my God!"
"I've loved you forever, I'm so excited you asked me!"""
"You nailed it, now all you have to do is get through the actual date."
"Oh, God!"
Emma's almost here.
Any last words of encouragement?
Ignore all your instincts.
So Clark likes Emma.
Who knew?
Me.
I know all the office secrets.
You don't know all the office secrets.
"Oh, really?"
What don't I know?
Is it about Clark?
Emma?
Jack?
It's about Jack.
[stammering]:
I didn't say that.
Didn't need to.
Jack and...
Sit down.
Talk to each other.
"Hey, Mr Einstein..."
-The cake.
"-Sally, get in here!"
-I was scared.
-Come on.
-Where's your father?
-Christmas shopping.
Let's see that thing.
That's nice!
-Should I put the candles on now?
-Yeah.
"You help her, Carlo."
-What is that?
Rum?
-Yeah.
Don't touch the antipasto until Pop sees it.
He's not ugly...
What do you think of the nerve of those Japs?
Bombing us on Pop's birthday.
They didn't know it was Pop's birthday.
Not surprising after the oil embargo.
They've got no right dropping bombs!
Are you a Jap-lover?
"-30,000 enlisted this morning."
-Bunch of saps...
-Why are they saps?
-Let's not talk about the war.
You talk to Carlo.
Only saps risk their lives for styangers.
-That's Pop talking.
"Oh, but this is very important."
"I'm sure it is, and I want to hear all about it."
"Well, I'd like to start from the beginning."
After breakfast.
But this is very important!
"Now, what would you like?"
"How about some oatmeal and a nice big glass of milk, huh?"
That'll build up your strength.
I'll take a look down this way.
"Oh, hello."
Hello.
Do you have a Nancy Collins listed?
Nancy Collins.
Let me see.
"Cooper, Collins, yes."
Drawing Room B. Right in here.
Thanks.
(BELL BUZZING)
Nancy?
Nancy?
Nancy.
(SCREAMS)
"Beg your pardon, I must have the wrong..."
Wrong room.
Excuse me.
That's quite all right.
Oh!
"Oh, why, Gretchen."
What are you doing here?
I drove down with Bob.
He was worried about you.
How nice.
We'll have an army with us!
Tony.
[chuckles]
Tony?
Tony?
"Tony, why can't I getthroughtoyou?"
Tony?
"I'll pick up the new transistors, make a few stops."
Be back later on.
[Letha] don't worry.
Everything's under control.
Tony.
"This is Letha wedge,"
Commanding you to open your eyes.
"Now, stand up."
We're going to the museum for education and profit.
[brakes squeak]
Tony and I will do a little...
Sightseeing.
[indistinct chatter]
[Tia] wait.
Gold!
I see gold.
- Hey it's mine.
- Where is it?
"- Hey, give it to me!"
- No!
A stagecoach.
She must be tuned in on a western.
Yeah.
I see dummies.
[both] that's you.
Is this enough?
- Plenty.
And a donut or some churros.
Keep them lucid.
- And for you?
- Another beer.
I'd better not mix anymore.
"Well, okay."
Give me both.
- What time is it?
- Late.
Get up.
They gave us a car while they fix ours.
FAIR WAGES
I heard last night the girls wanted to leave town.
- People talk a lot when they drink.
- And go where?
Anywhere.
Their father wasn't very happy with them.
Rocio.
Give these gentlemen some wine.
Say when.
When.
- For you?
"- No, thank you."
Smells good.
What is it?
- River crabs.
- Spicy?
- So what now?
- Which is their bedroom?
May I?
Vegas.
I could leave Detroit.
Run things from out here.
Put a little space between Marcus and I.
What for?
Is he hurting you?
No.
Not yet.
It's complicated.
Alright.
Then what is Taylor asking for?
Four million.
It's a drop in the bucket for a guy like Marcus.
I think he wants me to fail.
Why?
I almost died in Berlin.
Blade.
I got burned.
I think Marcus lost faith in me.
All he needs is an excuse to replace me.
Then he's a goddamn fool.
Lisa?
Lisa.
I called the house but nobody's there.
Nobody's answering.
Is the nurse there?
Lisa?
You chill to the bone.
Do you wanna go to the hospital?
"Alright, alright..."
"Well, let me take you home."
I don't want to go back there.
I think the point is to make us despair.
To see ourselves as animal and ugly.
To reject the possibility that God could love us.
"Will you excuse me, Damien?"
"Dimmy, why do you do this to me?"
"Please, Dimmy."
I'm afraid.
You're not my mother.
"Dimmy, please!"
What is it?
Her heart.
Can you give her something?
She'll go into a coma.
You're not my mother!
Don't listen.
"Why, Dimmy?"
Damien!
"Dimmy, please!"
Get out.
You son of a bitch!
Take me!
"""Our Father..."
"""...who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name...."""
Is it over?
Is she going to die?
No.
Come in to me!
"Goddamn you, take me!"
Take me!
No!
Mother.
Mother.
Got it?
"- Well, yes, but..."
- But what?
Well...
"- Hello, Mac."
"- Am I breaking in on anything here, Jim?"
"No, not at all."
Come right in.
I want you to meet Rocky Sullivan.
"Pleased to meet you, Sullivan."
I know all about you.
You're okay.
- When did you get out?
- Couple days ago.
- What are you doing?
- Looking around.
- Maybe I might have a spot for you.
- We were just talking about that.
- Where you stopping?
"- A room at my old neighborhood on Dock Street, number 24."
"Well, I'll blow now."
"I'll drop up, say, Monday?"
- Monday?
That'll be fine.
- I'm going downtown.
I'll give you a lift.
- Thanks.
"- See you later, Jim."
Monday.
Get me Steve.
There's a fella leaving with Mac.
I want you to...
As a friend?
Please?
SHUTTER CLICKS
That's it.
Look over your shoulder.
Look to the side...
INAUDIBLE
SHUTTER CLICKS
SHUTTER CLICKS
MAN GROANS AND GASPS
How did you do it?
Ohh!
Must've blacked out.
I don't remember much.
Banged my head on something.
There was...someone.
Where?
In the flat upstairs?
No.
"No, no, I can't be sure."
"Look, thank you, Miss Khan."
I'm really sorry to keep imposing on you.
"Let me call one of your colleagues, they can drive you back."
"No, no."
"I'm OK now, really."
What happened to her?
The girl upstairs.
You keep coming back.
You must think she...
Was she killed?
I can't rule that out.
WOMAN SOBS
- Thank you.
"Yeah, big boy!"
Mmm!
What... what are you watching?
!
Your girlfriend.

How could you do this?
You're a horrible friend!
Horrible!
"Aaron, 100,000 guys can watch Liza Blue online every day, but your roommate can't?"
You are a horrible friend!
Horrible!
That's not her name.
"Her name is Mary, okay?"
Mary!
"Okay, fine."
Mary!
"What are you going to do, man?"
Erase Mary from the entire Internet?

"Liza, it's Phillip."
No one can find you on the Internet.

Only one lame ass thing comes up when I Google your name.

"We're trying to get to Eugene, and I think we've been going the wrong way."
Can you show me what's going on here?
"Where are we, first of all?"
"Okay, wait."
Do I look like a tour guide?
"Why don't you buy the map, then I can help you."
Okay.
"Okay, now."
"Your problem is... (MAP RUSTLES) ...is you're way up here, you see that?"

So give me the edited highlights.
OK.
I'll know more after the second martini.
Hello.
"Caleb, wow."
"Hello, Mrs. Marin."
Hanna thought it was about time...

- I did?
I did.
"Um, Mom, this is Caleb."
Rivers.
"Nice to meet you, Caleb."
"Mrs. Marin, you have a lovely home, from what I've seen of it."
Caleb is new to Rosewood this year.
They brought me in to class the place up.
I see.
"Hanna, can I talk to you for a second?"
Is he some sort of rebound from Sean?
What?
No.
I don't want you alone with him in the house.
Go out.
"If you're gonna study, go to the library."
You let me study here with Sean.
"Well, I knew Sean."
Sean was a minister's son.
"Sean called you ""Hanna Banana."""
I'll get that for you.

I'll lay you 3-to-1 !

- That's right!
"Well, I don't know!"
- What do you want?
- I've seen these guys fight!
"Three-to-one, and I'll give you the draw!"
Here comes Nelson!
"Here he comes, Little Boy!"
Sit down!
You're making too much noise!
"Okay, Little Boy!"
"Hello, Little Boy!"
"Hello, Bunny!"
How are you?
See me after the show.
I'll tell you more.
"I hate Huang, and Huang's suspicious of you."
Let's cooperate.
I'll send you out of the country afterward.
They'll never get you.
But you may not be able to take Huang single-handed.
- Mayor!

Thanks for coming.
Have a seat please!
"Have a few more drinks, Marshal."
I'll get myself drunk alright.

"Trevor, it's okay."
"Oh God, what happened?"
I was crossing the street.
Lights changed on me.
Did he stop?
"No, he just kept going."
He fucking hit 'n run drivers man.
He gotta be hanged.
It was my fault.
I wasn't paying attention.
"Trevor, I gotta get you to a hospital."
You may have some internal injuries.
It's just bruises.
"Okay, you see this?"
"This is a bruise, and this is a train wreck, alright?"
What is it with you and doctors?
Don't you trust anyone?
I trust you.
Now I know you're crazy.
Can I stay here tonight?
"Baby, you can stay here every night."
"Hey, my veil is the same as yours."
"Oh, you're right."
It is.

I've changed my doctor.
But Boss.
Trilok's contract is for tomorrow.
And tomorrow's Saturday.
Trilok!
Saturday means no work.
Only singing and dancing.
"Well, what do you mean you don't-- What do you mean you don't need me?"
"- Al, if I'm here to help this girl,"
- You don't need... me?
I'm a little late.
[ Chuckles Nervously ]
Maybe I will sit this one out.
"[ Whirring ] Uh, Ziggy doesn't know why you're here, and about all he's got on the girl there is--"
Hilla.
Yes.
Hilla.
"Is she committed suicide by drowning... on November 9, 1 957."
November 9?
What?
What?
Today's her birthday.
She's 1 9.
Forever.
Why am I here?
I told you we don't know.
It's gotta have something to do with her.
Right?
"Who was she, Al?"
Who was she?
What songs did she like to sing?
Who'd she dream about at night?
William Holden.
What?
William Holden.
It's 1 957.
She's a teenager.
She had to have a crush on either William Holden orJames Dean.
"Uh, knowing her background, my money's on Bill."
He's also lucky because of you.
About what?
"You know, the go-getters."
Then feature your Auntie Isabel.
-She's a breast cancer survivor.
-That's right.
And guess what she's doing now?
-She's good!
-That will do.
-Why don't you feature your mom instead?
"-Oh, never mind."
"Dad wait, how many years have you been with mommy?"
Is it 29?
"Ara, is it 29?"
That's sweet!
You know what?
I wish me and Joy are just like that too.
Wait a second.
"-Oh, are you going to tell us something?"
"-Yes, of course!"
Why won't I?
.
"Dad, wait."
"It's like this, actually..."
She said...
Brother.
"-You've been together for just 1 year, right?"
-Yes!
So what?
Are you sure about your decision?
.
This is really all I want in my life.
- Okay.
- Okay.
"Uh, just grab a couple of bottles of chardonnay."
I'll get the sandwiches.
- These bottles?
BELINDA:
Yeah.
"- Christine, hi."
- Hi.
Um...
- I thought we didn't invite...
- We didn't.
She's here with Belinda.
- But I thought you fired...
- I didn't.
Hi.
I'm just helping out.
I'm a parent at Westbridge too.
"Actually, our kids are in the same class."
"Oh, The Kite Runner."
Oh.
What a great book.
The writing is super lyrical.
"Oh, not that chardonnay."
"Uh, could you see if there's any more Stags' Leap?"
"- Uh, I'd have a Merlot."
"- Oh, I'll have Merlot too."
Would you see if there's any bubble water in the fridge?
Yes.
"For you, a thousand times, yes."
Thank you.
"No, that's a line, um, uh, from the book."
He seems to...
"Well, he has..."
- a female.
- A female?

"Why, you brazen hussy!"
- Good heavens.
They're asleep!
"- Mumsie, look!"
Sergeant...
"The police, they found out!"
They've doped themselves.
We may still get away.
"- Mumsie, look!"
His moustache!
- They're onto us all right.
He's a plain-clothes brute disguised as an ordinary policeman.
We must get an earlier plane.
Stand guard while I finish packing.
- What's this for?
- To crown him with if he wakes.
- No!
"- In for a penny, in for a pound."
(Screams) No!
No!
Another?

Who is he?
- It's him!
- Him?

Can't think with the phone ringing.
"Dorothy, get over to the window and shut the blinds."
The rest of you stay put.
Don't do anything stupid.
"Come on, Dorothy!"
"All right, back with the others."
( cell phone rings )
What's that?
Whose is that?
Is that you?
Yeah.
- Answer it.
- You sure?
"Just don't say anything stupid, huh?"
Okay.
Hello?
"Ni-Ni-Nina, it's really not a good time."
"Allie doesn't run off, Nina."
That's not something she does.
I-I can't.
It's really hard to explain.
- Hang up.
- My daughter's missing.
- Hang up the phone.
- You can just wait.
Is she okay?
"- Yeah, she's all right."
- How do you know?
.
I know.

My 20th.
My parents couldn't be fucked to even phone.
They're on business in New York.
But they sent me this.
So the bar's free tonight.
Unlisted number
"Hi, mum!"

"Wait, right..."
Coming.
No.
No.
No.
- That's a cool shot.
- This.
Here it comes.
- Now.
- Bingo.
I love that.
I love that so much.
That gets a huge...
People will really laugh at that too.
That lipstick on the windshield thing took us a long time.
I know.
I know it.
Yeah.
- I had to be in a very specific spot.
- Yes.
"- Mike, you're thinking about me here."
- Yeah.
- Were you thinking about Kat here?
- No.
- He was thinking about...
- Food.
"I forget what I was thinking about, it wasn't Kat."
I don't think it was to do with the movie.
"It was probably, like, ""Why""..."
You were thinking about seeing No Country for Old Men.
"Oh, we gotta talk."
- You gotta show me your tricks.
Please.
- I tried that.
You won three times!
Look at those trophies!
You look.
All I see is a bunch of empty cups.
"You know, some automotive yoga could really lower your RPM's, man."

- Doc?
Our Doc?
- Not Doc Hudson.
"No, no, no, no, it's true!"
He's a real racing legend.
He's The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!
Fabulous?
I never seen Doc drive more than 20 miles an hour.
"I mean, have you ever seen him race?"
"No, but I wish I could have."
They say he was amazing!
- He won three Piston Cups!
- He did what in his cup?
- No.
"She does, doesn't she?"
JMJ?
"JMJ, we need to talk."
"- All right, just stop."
"- JMJ, we need to talk."

She may hurt you.
Just drop dead!
"JMJ, you gotta stop Pamela from telling on you."
- I'm gonna get Pamela to tell me...
- Shut up!
I want JMJ here in front of me!
She won't come!
I want JMJ right now!
I want JMJ right now!
JMJ?
JMJ?
"Jesus, Mary and Joseph?"
JMJ.
The nuns made us write that at the top of our worksheets every day.
I won't let her come.
She gets screwed if she comes.
"JMJ, I order you to come in the name of Jesus, Mary and Joseph."
Come out.
Hi.
Do you know where you are?
You're in a police station.
Do you know who I am?
"I'm Detective Pembleton, Homicide."
You killed eight people.
"I'm seven, duh!"
"$10,000."
And Desmond?
Des is out.
He's an addict.
I can't rely on him.
"I want to keep doing this, so I need a supplier and I need a partner."
Why do you want me to be your partner?
I've come to accept certain things about the work I do.
It's dangerous.
"I need protection, which I think you can provide."
Mm-hmm.
But it's up to you.
Uncle Grady?
"Hey, monkey, what are you doing out of bed?"
I had a bad dream.
- Monsters again?
- Yeah.
"Hey, come here."
I got ya.
I got ya.
It was really scary and they were chasing me.
"It's okay, baby."
There's nothing wrong.
Maya...
"I'd like you to meet my friend, Mary."
Hi.
You know what I do when I have a bad dream?
"I go right back to sleep, or else the monsters win."
To our future.

What is wrong with our Georgie?
She is incurably disgusted.
With what?
"Love, no doubt."
She should only have what Marie and I have.
(MEN LAUGH)
Only God deserves love.
I adore this silence.

Not presently.
I need this rest.
My tour next month is 20 cities.

You're going on a tour?
"Darling, did I forget to tell you?"
"What of your writing, your work?"
What of me?
Am I going with you?
We'll talk about it later.

"Hey, Woody's got something like that."
His is a pull string.

That's it.
There you go.
"Thank you, Grandad."
"You deserve a medal, mate."
Johnnie.
- Johnnie.
Johnnie.
- Careful.
The kid's pretty messed up.
He kept talking about some broad called Nancy.
I guess that must be you.
I'm Rose.
This is the Nancy.
Rose.
The propeller's snarled.
If I-
- If I can just cut it free--
Just pretend you're Errol Flynn.
He can do anything.
I've cut it free.
- She's moving.
"Come on, you beauty."
- She'll do it.
"I haven't had the chance to thank you, Mr. Brannigan, for bringing Johnnie back."
"There's no mister, and back home, they call me Gene."
"- Thank you, Gene."
"- Thank you, Gene."
- Tell me one thing.
"- Ah, yeah."
"Yeah, that's not a bad idea, that."
"Yeah, let's stick a foot on there!"
I tell you what.
I'll do a few remixes for you.
"If you like 'em, we'll sort something out."
- Remixes of what?
"- Shut it, Gollum."
It's none of your business.
- None of my business?
Remixing?
DJ Troy?
- Them's the words.
Now make sense of 'em.

Will you stop getting 'em out your bag?
It looks like a cannibals' picnic round here.
"- Who have you remixed, then?"
- Me.
"- Yeah, you."
"- No, me."
I've remixed me.
I remix me own tunes.
Right.
Any good?
No.
You've got one more guess.
"Think more ""opposite of good""."
"Just finished me album, ""Troy's Noise""."

Why don't you take Mr. Mansley with you?
Show him the sights.
"Oh, Mom, the sights?"
"Hey, I'd love that."
"Give us a chance to get acquainted, swap some stories, huh, chief?"
- He's a thief.
- Meantime I'II report him.
- He's gone.
- Afugitive?
"- No, he checked out."
He popped off.
- He croaked.
- I don't understand.
- Dead.
- Great start!

There must be a hotel around.
"This time of year, at this hour?"

Okay.

Want me to carry it?
Come in.
It's kind of you to host me.

All done.

Okay.
"What is this, like, some kind of memory test or something like that?"

You might feel a slight twinge as it initializes.
"Oh, okay."

Nearly there.
I thought I turned that off.

"Yep, yeah."
- And now?

"Ilango, where is Kutty?"
Tell him to come.
He went somewhere.
Cuddappah Raju questioned him where he went.
He didn't tell him anything.
He hit him with an iron rod.
No Velu.
Listen to me.
Cuddappah Raja asked him several times.
He should have told him the truth.
That's his fate.
No Velu.
This is our curse.
Let's go.
How many times to tell you?
Are you deaf?
You fear death.
Not me.
Singamuthu is in jail.
I saw him.
They threatened me.
But I told them nothing.
Take him to hospital.
Make it fast.
Shocked?
I'm not Murugesh to get beaten up.
"I'm Vel, Singamuthu's son."
Vetrivel.
He will come.
I swear.
His words have come true.
One must give birth to a son like him.
"Oh, wow."
I love pie.
"I was just kidding, but so do I."
Oh.
"So, um, anyway, uh..."
Night.
Good night.

I'm coming out of a... pretty dark time in my life right now.
You are?
Why?
"It's-it's just been, like, everything that, like, could go wrong has... gone wrong."
"And I almost... didn't make it to this party tonight, but I'm-I'm so glad that I did."
"You're, like, the, uh- the first good thing that's happened in my life in the last two years."
I am?
"You are like this amazing, shining, positive-"

Lunch?
No.
"Well, my daughters are fixing me lunch."
Why don't you come over?
"Uh, I don't want to impose."
You're not imposing.

Give me a buzz.
I miss you.
Here's to Simon.
Cheers.
- I love Cristal.
"- Simon, you're a darling."
"Happy 20th, buddy."
Let's party!
- I didn't bring a present.
- None of us did.
- He didn't tell us.
- I'm just glad you all came.
This rocks.
Where did you get it?
Yugo Danny.
It's hard-hitter blow from Columbia.
"- Angel, come on."
Are we going?
- Yes.
"- Come on, let's go."
"Come on, Mike."
Reply to the phone.
- Will not Answer?
- Do you have to move this bear herey Hery?
- My mother had given me.
- Okay.
I'm sorry.
What do you think?
"Beautiful, is not it?"
- What's the problem?
- I do not like this place.
"This is only temporary, okay?"
Just for a two nights.
Remember?
"Soon, not whisper their home."
"Who knows, maybe one of those pools."
"First, a few need to handle the job, okay?"
"Then they whisper very, very far away."
- Really?
- Yes.
- You know what?
I am sure that Bella liked here.
"- No, I did not like."
Is that right?
Let us ask him then.
"It's beautiful, Bella?"
See?
Complacent.
Ah...
Yeah.
- Wow.
- Huh?
You're amazing!
What are you doin'?
"Doc, wait!"
Giddup right in there!
"Come on, Rusty."
"Doc, hold it!"
"Seriously, your driving's incredible!"
- Wonderful.
"Now, go away."
"- Hey, I mean it."
You've still got it!
- I'm askin' you to leave.
- Come on.
"I'm a racecar, you're a much older racecar, but under the hood you and I are the same."
We are not the same!
Understand?
"Now, get out."
How could a car like you quit at the top of your game?
You think I quit?
Right.
Your big wreck in '54.
They quit on me.
"When I finally got put together, I went back expecting a big welcome."
You know what they said?
"""You're history. """
Moved right on to the next rookie standing in line.
There was a lot left in me.
I never got a chance to show 'em.
-Yes.
He tries to buy their freedom.
Why would he do that?
He lives a good life in Malaysia with his wife and children.
How do you know?
"William, have you had contact with him?"
I had to do something.
-Oh my God.
No.
It is you.
You asked him to come here.
10.2 million euros.
That is the price for Karine?
"He killed her, he hit her head against the stone until it cracked!"
Finally.
It was not him.
Tonje saw him somewhere else.
The alibi was a joke!
We all know it!
Try to think ahead.
Think of the responsibilities we have.
Here you can not ask me.
Never.
Never.
Hey dear.
"God, so good to see you."
-Oh?
Has it been good?
Aksel Nilsen.
It's rescuer.
-The Aksel Nilsen?
-Yes.
Perfectly harmless.
- Vets use them all them time.
- Will it hurt it?
No.
It'll put it out for a few minutes.
Everyone stay quiet.
"Jo, don't miss this."
I never miss.
- Did you miss?
- No.
There's two of them.
Two beasts?
Wait.
They might not be fully under yet.
- I have to see them.
- Let me and Steve get them into the container.
"Safety first, OK?"
- OK.
- Jo.
What about safety first?
Fine.
Miss the reveal.
"Steve, go ahead and check they are out."
Maddy and Rhydian are going to be mad they missed this.
- You OK?
"- Yeah, why?"
You're shaking.
Is this happening?
"Like, is this actually happening?"
Yeah.
Believe it.
I don't think I can.
End of discussion.
If the contract's been taken the job will be done.
Fine then I'll leave.
- See you uncle.
- Bless you.
Boss.
An elderly person's waiting for you outside.
I asked him to come in but he refused.
He's standing outside in the hot sun.
Ask him what he wants.
No he wants to meet only you.
What's his name?

I'm surprised you've come to our home for the first time and you didn't bring anything.
You're the first woman I've met at this school with a job.

But they got to her.
They reprogrammed her at Nordstrom's.

Cary asked me.
I know.
He's just on a call.
"So, the IRA agreed to an Offer and Compromise, on your tax case."
The IRA?
The... the IRS.
"You'll have to pay a penalty, we can deal with all the specifics later, but you have some un-cashed checks in your file."
You should take a look at those.
Thanks.
I'm not gay.
You asked whether I was gay?
Yes... two years ago.
I know.
I wanted to answer.
"I'm not gay, I'm flexible."
Okay.
Flexible.
Good.
"And, uh..."
"Lana Delaney, this FBI agent, that's... flexible?"
Yeah.
"More importantly,"

"The one you really liked, but he was married and his wife was your patient."
What was his name?
Noah.
"Yeah, Noah."
I have never felt this way.
I would have never known if I hadn't met you.

You know you totally get me.
It's weird.
You are so my type.

"Stylish, cool."
"A little crazy, but not bad."
This is the kind of boy I wanted.
But this...
"Actually before I met him, I didn't know what I wanted."

"But sometimes it helps, it calms you."

Let me ask you something.
Did you bring a gift?
- Of course.

Nobody means that.
You took that seriously?
- Of course I did.
Look at all these.

"Oh, what do you got there, chicken?"
"Oh yeah, thank you."
"- No, I'm fine, thank you."
"- No, thank you."

- Good.
He's worth over a billion and started out flat broke.
- But you can't tell.
- That he started flat broke?
"No, no..."
- Jacob Pedersen is here.
- Have a seat.
Just for a moment.
"- It was nice to meet you, Jacob."
I don't know what you're doing or who you are.
"- Yes, you do."

"Now, that's unusual-- somebody who'd do something like that, something worth that much."
"Yeah, and we'll swing by and pick up Stu at the Bullfrog."
Yeah.
I gotta get a shirt.
Shirt.
Have you redone the bedroom?
You like it?

Can I go to the museum?
Sure.
"Hey, yeah, that's a good idea."
You got your gun?
Yeah.
I'm going to go in there like Billy the Kid and plug anyone that gets in my way.
"- Right, Mike?"
"- Hey, Billy."
- Well...
"Hey, there!"
"Bring me some of that strong Russian shit, ladies."
"Okay, now where's that booster pump?"
Where is it?
Did you get it?
Did you get the fucking... (PANTING)
Yeah!
Fucking hell.
This is it.
"This is it, yeah?"
"Okay, hang on."
"Okay, hold this, lady."
Shit.
"Okay, I gotta get this little fucker in there."
Who am I kidding?
I'm in no condition to do this.
I'm sorry.
"I'm in no condition to do this, mate."

I didn't see anything.
That was funny.

Hey!
Looks like TV.
Can I use your phone?
The phone's over here.
Where are your parents?
I only have one.
A father.
He's in the T onapiya Wetlands.
What's that?
"Well, this was all once the T onapiya Wetlands."
"He's trying to save the last five acres, but he won't."
Why?
No money.
"He teaches science by day, and, I don't know, tries to save the wetlands by night."
"I admire him, but I pity him, too."
You pity him?
"Well, yeah, his goals aren't realistic."
That's him.
"Look, would you mind getting out of here?"
Not at all.
(PEOPLE EXCLAIMING)
"Oh, I'm..."
What is the matter with you?
I'm awfully sorry.
I'm just a little nervous.
"I'm awfully sorry I dropped my suitcase, and I hope I didn't hurt you, mister."
"I'll put all my things back in the suitcase, and I'll get out of your way."
What is this?
(EXCLAIMING)
"Look out, conductors!"
It's the little boy!

You've got to find him?
We've got to find him.

CONDUCTOR 2:
He must be around here someplace.
Hello.
Goodbye.
The train hasn't stopped.
He couldn't have gotten off.
"What's the matter, son?"
You're trembling.
I have very loose bones.
Are you lost?
Why don't you take it?
I don't know.
It was Bennet's.
- I'd feel weird.
- Carrie...
"It's not your fault, what happened to him."
It's Bennet's.
You did a good job.
You should own that.

Look at this.
Dude's got a memory blocker.
"Well, that's about all I can do for you, mate."
Time for a reboot.
"See you in about 15 minutes, hopefully."
Hey.
He's awake.
Your eyes might be a bit blurry.
"It's just your depth perception trying to calibrate, yeah?"
"Follow me as I walk, yeah?"
Get up.
Okay.
All right.

It's like burying treasure.

Let them leave.
I have the package.
"Ground floor, through the library and down the stairs."
- The library.
We're on our way.
- We'll be waiting for you.
That's the library.
Don't go in there.
"Just-- Oh, this is so stupid."
You're not gonna get away with this.
Martin!
What are you doing?
"No, Mr. President."
"The question is, what are you gonna do?"
Gonna shake my hand again?
Give a little speech?
Is this about Kevin?
"Look, I'm sorry--"
"Run, Mr. President!"
"To me, to me, to me!"
Move!
Walker.
"Move, move, move!"
"Let's go, let's go, let's go!"

"Go, go."

He's hypoxic.
Let's change him over to a Shiley.
"Dr. Greene, the press is going berserk."
They want a statement.
We're a little busy right now.
Tell them he's holding his own.
Right.
"Let's get a CBC, lytes, blood gas and coags."
- What's his core temp?
- Eighty-two degrees.
That's too low.
Put him on heated humidified O-2.
Heated saline.
"Let's start him on lidocaine, 0.8 mgs per minute."
Hope he doesn't go back into V-fib.
"Doug, you're a mess."
Samuel's sister.
Ah!
He was in office.
Last night he was working late.
It was bombed.
They have asked me to identify him.
I...
I'm unable.
Mr.Hilliard?
Mr.Hilliard?
"I'm afraid my dear, someone has made a mistake."
I almost did that myself.
"You see Sammy Smith, has two fingers missing from his left hand."
I'm sorry.
We tried very hard to...to make a whole person.
For the relatives.
Is it him?
Is it your friend?
My agent...
Yes.
That's him.
"You can stay with us, if you like."
It's very peaceful.
I'm sure we can make room.
"To Mrs.Cole, Seasonal Greetings."
With very best wishes

P.S. We hope the film is going well.
"Happy New Year, Mr.Hilliard."
"Sammy, liked the veal, I believe."
Do you also recommend it?
It's not veal in the pre-war sense.
"I don't think I can drink any more water, Howard... especially with this belt."
What's that got to do with it?
"Well, I have to go to the bathroom, and I..."
- can't stand up.
"- Oh, honey."
Bob's gotta go to the... bathroom.
Excuse us.
"- Honey, you okay?"
"- Oh, oh."
"Oh, oh."
Shh.
Quiet.
- Surprise!
- For he's a jolly good fellow
For he 's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
Which nobody can deny
- Speech.
"- Speech, speech, speech."
All right.
"This, I'll have to admit this really was a surprise, and I-"
"I wanna tell you how much I appreciate it, but-"
- Aw.
- I really have to go to the bathroom.
"- Uh, Emily?"
- What?
How do I look?
"Oh, I love the pants."
But the jacket doesn't match.
"No, no."
I lost two inches around my waist.
"Oh, Bob."
I will investigate it all.
What's this?
- We found something.
- Come here.
This...
"What do you think this is, Team Leader Song?"
When you choke someone by the neck...
Seo Jun Seok and President Hwang's... necks?
Tell Im Tae Ho to come out here!
Wait a minute.
What is that?
That wasn't in our car before!
Sir.
"This is what I think, in all seriousness."
"There are times when you must run away, even when you did nothing wrong."
"I think that's your best move, to make some time for yourself."
Honey.
"You trust me, right?"
Take good care of the kids.
"Hey, hey, hey!"
"Look, look, look!"
Look over there!
Go catch him!
Oh...
Hey...
- What are you doing?
- Let go of me!
Let go!
Will you be okay?
Are you okay?
- Come here!
- Hey!
Meet me at Omar's.
Be ready for me.
I'm going after that truck.
How?
I don't know.
I'm making this up as I go.
Ew!
He's there!
Idiot!
Idiot!
Everything at last has been arranged.
The Ark?
Is on board.
"Nothing is lacking, now that you're here."
Or what is left of you.
You trust these guys?
Yes.
Mr. Katanga.
"Mr. Katanga, these are my friends."
They are my family.
I will hear of it if they are not treated well.
My cabin is theirs.
Mr. Jones...
"I've heard a lot about you, sir."
Your appearance is exactly the way I imagined.
Good-bye.
Look out for each other.
I am already missing you.
You're my good friend.
Sallah.
That is for Fayah... that is for your children... and this is for you.
Thank you.

"Come on, get in the car."
- It's Ryan Gosling.
Come on.
- This is gonna be amazing.
"- I assure you, it's just fine and dandy."
"- He invited us, sweetheart."
- Can we stop by my house?
I don't really wanna be wearing this.
- You look fine.
- You look like schoolgirls.
"- Hey, let's go shopping."
"- Oh, my gosh."
This is amazing.
"Okay, Grace, you have the coolest mom in history."
- Ryan Gosling.
"- Oh, my gosh."
Aah!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
"Wait, wait, what did he say?"
"""Absolutely."
"We'll be here working all night long."""
"I said, ""Really?"
"It's okay if we come by?"""
"He said, ""Yeah, we're just rehearsing now."""
- Ohh.
"- Uh, um..."
- What are these?
- She doesn't know what they are.
Ha-ha-ha.
They're goldfish.
"I know what a goldfish is, but why do you have goldfish in your car?"
- Can't believe I got all my stuff back.
"- You did, but most of it's broken."
"Yeah, it's broken, but, I don't know, it's mine."
"Yeah, but it's broken."
"Hey, look at that."
I think it's working.
"- Oh, my God!"
- We got a TV again.
- It's a TV and it's working!
"- Hey, we got the TV back!"
All right.
You guys are awesome.
I'm gonna make you so much jam.
"- Please, don't."
"- Oh, we're gonna have ajam sess."
Absolutely not.
"- Okay, what are we watching?"
- I have some DVDs.
"Adventures in Babysitting, Prancer, Newsies, Curly Sue."
- I'm going out.
- Yeah.
Wait.
Where are you guys going?
These are heartwarming films.
- Curly Sue.
Let's do this.
"- All right, let me go get it."
- Get out.
- Why?
"Unlike your father, I am a man who keeps his word."
(SPEAKING IN SUDANESE ARABIC)
I love this song uh.
It reminds me of being in Rome.
I wonder if toe sucking is big in Rome?
Baby you want a beer?
The six pack no?
"Baby, we have good energy."
We have a good energy me and you no?
Yes.
Come here...
Come dance with Papi.
Me and JP have been together on and off for about six months.
It's going pretty good but sometimes I get the feeling I'm not the only girl JP's seeing.
"Oh, JP..."
Ahhhh no no...
Are you still there?
Just stay here.
Who is that JP?
"Ah, computer is broken"
Is crazy joke ha ha...
No...
Come out where ever you are.
I only have eyes for you.
Hey JP!
Let's do that thing with the toes again.
Call me if you want to rendezvous.
Hey...

OK?
That's a reasonable explanation... right?
JP...
JP...
- Never mind.
Dad's at Aunt Rosa's.
She wants us to come.
- What?
- Dad is at Aunt Rosa's!
- He came especially?
Why?
- How should I know?
He isn't answering.
Where is he?
Ricky doesn't have to follow us everywhere.
- What did Rosa say?
- To come.
You're more hysterical than her.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Why didn't you invite me along?
That was very unkind of you.
You want to know who your father is.
Good for you.
Really.
"But I want to know, too."
"I want to know who raised you, who was with you all your lives."
I won't hold you up.
Have some tea and go.
It seems Aunt Rosa has something to say that I thought you should hear.
That's all.
"Rosa, where's the Sweet'N'Low?"
In the kitchen?
I swore to Jonah.
"I have to pinch myself, I think I'm dreaming."
Cut it out!
Were you looking for dr.
Shep--
Are you a good girl?
I-- What?
A good girl.
I don't mean perfect.
I mean...
Relatively speaking.
- Are you?
- Yes.
How many sexual partners have you had?
I won't judge.
Six.
"No, s-seven."
K-kinda six.
But kinda seven.
- Criminal record?
- Speeding ticket.
- How fast?
- 12 miles over.
That's fast.
"Well, it wasn't too-- it wa-- it was way too fast."
But I was-
- I was downhill and I was-
- I was-
"- I was coasting, ma'am."
Now I don't suppose you can tell me...
Where the gift shop is?
"First floor, east wing."
It's like pudding in here.
This is exactly why I don't do this procedure.
"I mean, you're living with broken legs for months."
"Now, who is ready for their yoga?"
My name's Jason.

"Hello, Cynthia."
"Yes, we have a brave peacock."
Use that.
Yes.
Yes.
"Hi, you must be Veronica."
Hi.
"Yeah, how did you know?"
"Why, I have read that you have studied the yoga for five years."
"Oh, well, I mean, just off and on, you know, before the kids came."
Nonsense.
"You know, there is such thing called the muscle memory?"
"And I could tell by looking at your gait, your muscles remember."
Thank you.
Yes.
"Okay, we are going to do the children's position."
What's that?
"Head down, buttocks up."
Everybody on your mats.
"Yeah, that's good."
That's good.
Very nice posture.
Yes.
Encouragement.
I'm maintaining pressure on the baby's head.
"Yes, sir."
Is there something wrong with the baby?
"- Hey, it's okay."
Everything's fine.
- What?
- It's okay.
- Get some techs in here.
Chadway will meet us in the OR.
Try not to push on your next contraction.
You may have to have a caesarean section.
Your baby's head is pressing against the umbilical cord.

Caught up with a girl
Girl...?

And she falls for me.

He bored me.
"He had me all alone, and he began flirting"
Same old hat... haven't I seen you before?
She sidled up to me.
- What?
I was scared!
"Only so much space, and there she was with me"
Then?
- Then what?
She was lost in my eyes
He was after my eyes.
Wouldn't shut up.
Boys these days...
These girls!
I just managed to come out unscathed
What's that?
I got a better shot letting him fuckin' drive.
What are you waitin' for?
The car's cold.
Get the fuck out of here!
"What, warm it up?"
Get out of here!
-Who is it?

Let me in.
Morris didn't come home.
He's missing.
I know something's happened.
Calm down.
He's missing!
I know something happened.
He's probably drunk and fell asleep somewhere.
In 27 years he's never been away all night without calling.
I know something's happened.
I know you know.
Let me get changed.
I'll take you home then look for him.
I've been home!
I've been on the phone--
-So what the fuck you want me to tell Belle?
-Who gives a fuck?
Tell her he ran off with some broad.
What do you care about her?
-Watch this.
-Don't fuck with them.
I do it all the time.
Let's get you into makeup.
Hm...
You do look handsome in your sowester.
Mr.Hilliard's going to be awfully angry.
I'll blame War Transport.
He'll have to make a deal with me.
So?
Fishes!
Fishes every....
Don't...stand under any thousand pounders.
Uh.
The Director wants to speak to you.
Let me guess.
He's canceling my fitting for the dog costume.
He didn't say what it's 'bout.
"Tell him, ""he can find me""."
But...
I have found you.
No you haven't.
You are a masseuse.
Leaning the way of the ship.
"With Johnnie cradled, cradled in your arms."
Cradle.
Oh!
No...no thank you.
You look up.
And you see coming towards you...across the deck.
A vision of loveliness.
And you say.
Get up!
"""Kid's pretty messed up."""
"Girl, kid's pretty messed up."
He's my arch enemy...
in affairs of the heart!
Alright!
I promise you!
I won't be with him after you've rescued him!
Really?
"Yes, I really mean it."
Will you come with me then?
"Sure I will, wherever you go!"
Yoyo's locked up there.

From here!
I go first!
Come up.
Hurry!

Old friend!

Ask him!
"Yoyo, tell us."
I won't!

You'll get Amelian!
"(A million) ln that case, I won't say anything!"

"- Say, ""Thankyou, Snookie."""
"- Thankyou, Snookie."
Get your ass on the floor.
"Ticket, please."
Have a good trip.
"Excuse me, is this seat taken?"
No.
I love ballet.
I never had the body for it.
You dance?
I used to.
I've got something for you.
"It's for love, not luck because you don't need luck."
You dance like an angel.
Mom...
You're the best luck I'll ever have.
- Are you okay?
- I keep messing up the pirouettes.
"It's frustrating, but it'll be okay."
My mom's gonna be there.
You have nothing to worry about.
You're the best dancer in Lamont.
"This is not Lamont, it's Julliard, New York City."
- Do you want to pray?
- What?
You're leaving for St. Louis.
I'm not gonna see you.
We should pray.
"Awesome Father, S.J. Auditions today, let her do okay..."
- Give me two cards.
- It's good for 80000.
I can only get 1500 from the ATM.
I'll transfer the balance and add 2000 for your trouble.
Did your mum drop you as a baby?
I don't want 4500 in the bank.
I am on welfare.
So get another card or go elsewhere.
- Give me yours.
- Mine's behind the bar.
I need it.
Wait here.
Back to the Edge.
Out of the car!
- What are you doing with Yugo Danny?
- Nothing.
What's this?
- ID.
ID.
- In my right-hand pocket.
Alexander Seeberg?
Judge Seeberg's son?
- Did you hurt your footsie?
- Just come along.
Not with you.
You and your partner broke my rib last time.
See you in court.
Can I see your watch again?
How much did you say it cost?
25000.
- How about going somewhere else?
- Right.
Run!
Don't let them catch you!
"Jeffrey, run!"
The cops are afteryou!
Freeze!
"Jeffrey, the cops are all around!"
The cops are everywhere!
Run!
"Jeffrey, run away!"
"It's me,Jenny."
Don't move!
Let's go.
"What's wrong, officer?"
Flirting isn't a crime.
Arrest him!
"Keep clear, everyone."
Let me through.
Open those suitcases.
- What were you doing at the airport?
- Chasing a piece ofass.
What's yourjob?
I'm a casting agent for movie companies.
- But you resisted arrest!
- I was drunk.
Stand up and walk a straight line!
- Where's your friend?
- What friend?
You know who.
He's in grave danger.
Help him.
Tell me where he is.
I want to help him solve his problem.
We all had that.
Why can't they have that?
I don't know.
"There, did you see that?"
- What?
- That guy.
- People are looking at me.
- That's good.
They're looking at me.
"Oh, they're looking at you."
H i.
H i.
See?
Now what was that about?
- He said hi?
- That was not hi.
- That was hi.
- That was a different hi.
That was a he wants to get to know you hi.
From someone who never talks to me has never talked me...
and would never talk to me.
Except now he thinks you put out so he talks to you.
"- See, I told you that note was good."
- Rayanne.
Maybe Jordan started the rumor.
Don't be ridiculous.
It's a very guy thing to do.
- Hey Catalano.
- Hey.
"So, what about this gun thing?"
I would hate to be that soda bottle.
Splat.
"Don't worry, boss, I will."
[Rustling]
[Toilet flushing]
[Gasping]
Charlie!
Tommy!
"Hey, you!"
"I know you're out there, somewhere!"
What are you doin'?
"What the hell are you doin', huh?"
"What the... oh, Jesus Christ, no, no."
"Hey, look..."
"Hey, listen, pal."
"Wait a minute, wait a minute!"
I wanna talk to you.
I wanna talk to you...
look.
"What are you doing, huh?"
"Listen, who hired you..."
Who hired you?
What are you doin'?
"Wait a minute, wait a minute."
"You're not gonna get away with it, you hear me?"
"Holy shit... what are you, crazy, or something?"
"Hey-hey, you don't wanna fucking talk to me?"
What are you doin'?
"Hey, leave that alone, huh?"
"Oh, Jesus Christ, hold it... take it easy."
"Don't do it, don't do it."
"Hold it... no, no, no."
Holy shit.
"Holy... hey, wait a minute."
-And I went up.
"-Son, we are penguins"
-We can not fly.
-But Sven is a penguin.
"I do not know what type of penguin Sven is, but penguins are"
"Emperor, we can not ..."
-If I learn to fly
Mom can get out of there.
I do not know if there is a way out.
"Erik, surely, is not flying."
If you want you must desire and if you want
-What is your wish!
"-Erik, get real."
They are trapped.
They are hungry and afraid.
The last thing we need is false hope.
-Boys?
-Then all will die.
"Boys, what's the problem with you two?"
It's just a conversation.
-Erik?
We need a mother's love.
It will explode.
"Dude, why will not catch a few more fish?"
"He is not hungry, Aunt Gloria."
"Yeah beauty, Atticus, I know, I understand."
I'm going fishing.
"Erik, stop with this anger."
"Calm down, Erik."
"Honey, take a step back."
Close your eyes ...
Take a deep breath ...
"God bless the moon, and God bless me"
And God bless the somebody
I'd want to see
God looked down from up above
And he picked you out for me to love
He picked you out from all the rest
'Cause he knew that I loved you the very best
I see the moon and the moon sees me
And the moon sees somebody I'd want to see
God bless the moon and God bless me
And God bless the somebody I'd want to see
Good morning.
Hey.
Sit down.
Thanks.
Guess what.
What?
I'm pregnant.
You're kidding.
Never more serious.
Wow.
"Oh, uh..."
Are you happy?
Yeah!
Are you happy?
I think so.
"Yeah, I think I am."
Sit down.
Should you sit down?
"I'm only two months along, I'm fine."
"Oh, my God."
A baby.
Do you have children ...
Appear in your profile.
"All have a profile, right?"
"On ""Com all2gethr.""."
"Take a good, I saw the picture marriage is crazy."
And i. .. beautiful
I'm sorry.
That was three years ago.
Naughty girl ...
Naughty.
- Is it for your friends.
- Who cares?
It seems very friendly ...
"Do not worry with it, getting married next month."
"Really, who benefits?"
"So, something about you, Mr darkness ..."
- About me?
- Yes.
You do not need to profile even photos.
What can I say?
Hold them for me.
We waited in rare cases.
"Well, for me, is in order."
Damn.
And say once again.
Hey ... empty.
Let ...
Thank you.
That's all right.
This from the host ...
Hey!
We are ready to go.
- Yeah.
Shady Lady.
"Oh, my God."
Stop!
Whoa.
"Take a right, Nicolas!"
"Take a right, a right!"
Nicolas!
Nicolas!
"Hey, Nicolas!"
I need some help here.
Okay.
Somebody get a doctor!
"Hang on Nicolas, I'm going for help."
Nicolas!
"I swear to God, I don't know what happened."
He's epileptic.
I should have told you.
- I'll call an ambulance.
"- No, it will pass."
"It's okay, baby."
This hasn't happened for a while.
I didn't think to mention it.
I could kill myself for taking him on that ride.
"It's okay, it's not your fault."
He won't even remember it.
It'll be as if nothing ever happened.
Wanna come in?
I think you could use a drink.
I hope wine's okay with you.
That'll work.
What good is a home if you can't relax in it.
"- Just myths, of course."
I doubt they're true.
That Hori...
Hiromitsu.
- Yes.
He died.
It's probably impossible to find out who has the other 11 tattoos.
Not at all.
But I'd like to know what this has to do with Lynn's death.
Nothing.
Just curious.
Actually I'm not supposed to give you this stuff.
Since you're on leave.
"Yeah, I know."
It's just for my report.
Oh well.
The case is closed.
"And anyway, you played a part in it, too."
Yeah?
"Yeah, did you check the list of names?"
Just a sec.
I got Lynn Wilson.
I need the other 11 people with a Hiromitsu.
Yes.
And all of them are reported dead or missing?
Thanks.
Thanks.
Schrader.
Schrader!
You aren't needed here.
Dix.
How observant.
I don't feel very well.
What the hell is that?
"Ok, I'm gonna call 911."
"Come on, pick up that goddamn phone."
I think I need something to eat.
"Please hang up, and try your call again."
"Please hang up now, this is a recording."
"Please hang up, and tr..."
Krista.
Oh no!
No!
Is he dead?
Yeah.
- What are you doing?
- Make it sure he stays that way.
Where will she go now?
I don't know.
- Think.
- I don't know!
They are all dead!
My entire family is... dead.
Not yet.
But the sun is coming up soon.
Let's go.
She's hanging out with a different crowd now.
Ever heard of Marcus Van Sciver?
"Van Sciver Incorporated, how can I direct your call, hello?"
Hello?
Krista.
All you have to do is die.
Welcome to the family.
Family?
I suppose?
Nazi bastard.
Over behind the church.
You know where I mean?
It's a red-brick wing.
St. Mike's.
What goes on there?
Who's the priest I keep seeing there?
He's there all the time.
"He has black hair, and he's intense-looking."
Damien Karras.
That's his office behind St. Mike's.
He's our psychiatric counselor.
"Had a pretty rough knock last night, poor guy."
His mother passed away.
"She was living by herself, and I guess she was dead a couple days before they found her."
Cunting hun!
Bloody damn butchering Nazi pig!
Stop it!
I'll kill you!
Aah!
Leave him alone!
Get out!
Get out!
[Shouting]
What's the matter with you?
What's for dessert?
You sleeping?
[Drunken singing]
Whoa!
"Steady, big fella."
Ok.
Get your Late Afternoon Star.
Afternoon Star:
Latest news in the latest paper.
That's the idea.
"Thank you, sir."
Late Afternoon Star right over here.
Get your Late Afternoon Star.
Here comes the colonel.
"He's in that cabin, colonel."
"You can't go down there, colonel."
The boy's gone crazy.
BROCK:
"Go on, back!"
No one's taking me and that goes for you too.
"Stay there or I'll drop you, I meant it."
Your last chance to turn around.
I'll count three.
One.
Two.
Three.
Send the doc.
Hurry it up.
"Hello, Dad."
Why am I calling you dad;
"-You used to call me that, Brock."
-Not since I got old enough to know better.
Growing up.
"That's great, isn't it;"
Don't talk.
Don't talk.
"You don't scare worth a nickel, Dad."
"-Docs always try, don't they;"
- What?
- No...
"No, not that."
Small...

Fly!
Flying Tart!
"No, no, no, it got off to a flying start, and it's name... was Dragonfly!"
"Thank you, Polly."
"If I find out the money on that horse was yours, you know what I'll do, Basil."
You'll have to sew 'em back on first.
"- Ah, Major!"
"- 6:00, old boy."
"Oh, so it is."
"Uh, Major..."
"Can I offer you, uh..."
"Oh, very decent of you."
Just a quick one.
Going to a memorial service.
Ah.
"Tie's a bit bright, isn't it, Major?"
- What?
- For a memorial service?
"Oh, I didn't like the chap."
One of those.
Know what I mean?
- Cheers.
"- Uh, Major... could you do me a favor?"
"Well, I'm a bit short myself, old boy."
"No, no, could you look after some money for me?"
I won it on that horse.
"Only Sybil's a bit suspicious, you see?"
Do... no.
"My... my father never looked like that, so he can't be."
He isn't.
"He isn't, he isn't."
- But he is.
- Mnh-mnh.
He's the best version of your father.
"Physically, his cells were recoded for optimal capacity."
"Physically, he is the best version."
"Inside, however, I'm still just me."
You saw it.
"I think Gracie saw it, too."
Don't you say her name.
Arthur:
Agent Pritchard's facial effect indicates he is at 54% acceptance.
What the hell is that thing?
"Agent Pritchard, let me take you through this slowly, from the start."
You're not taking me through anything.
Mnh-mnh.
Mnh-mnh.
"You two, this... this apartment, this... that tank out there."
That... that thing in the mirror.
- I'm not...
- Duval!
Son.
It's me.
I'm back.
No.
I buried you.

The Pentagon will hear about this.
- I'm not really built for war.
- Get out here.
Did you hear about Mr. Rossi.
"-No, what?"
-He's leaving town.
-Leaving?
"-Well, not really leaving."
They're trying to make him principal of a high school in Portland.
-Are you sure?
-Of course.
I got it first hand.
From Mr. Rossi?
"From Kathy, who got it from Betty, who got it from Miss Thornton."
I suppose that's first hand.
I guess we won't be able to keep him here.

No.

"Your uncle must've taken the tonic, too."
It's turned the town upside down.
We've gotta bring him in.

"If you do it well, you can record your own song, become rich and famous and make a gazillion new friends."
How does that sound?
I'm all ears.
Uh...
- Oh.
"- That was, um, original."
Thanks.
It's called Funky Sitar Groove To The Max.
"Oh, Yeah."
Uh...
"Relax, okay?"
Scanning.

"Wonderful, Henry."

"Cool, right?"
Integument?
Please don't move your hand.
You probably don't recall.
You were never a big fan of my work.
Maybe this will change your mind.
Right?
Memory's a funny thing.
I'm an expert and I don't know if you'll ever get yours back.
"You don't remember me at all, do you, Henry?"
My name is Estelle.
You and I were... we still are... husband and wife.
"I love you, Henry."
I can't wait to hear you say it.

His memories are still catching up with him.

That's why I called Greg.

I insisted.
Hilla was one of my best employees.

Mr. Truesdale.
"Uh, she's back here."
Oh.
You were close?
Uh--
Yeah.
We were friends.
"I-- Ah, he's a good-looking kid."
Lots of girls at the lodge have their eye on him.
"Suck it up, Greg."
[ Chuckles ] Kid's got his mother's stomach.
Seems like there was more to it than that.
Her name's Hilla.
Hilla Danner.
I hired her as a desk clerk at the beginning of the season.
"She, uh, have any family?"
I believe they were all killed during the war.
"Well, looks like you're gonna have to bury her in potter's field."
I'll pay for it.
"Well, that's real nice of you, sir."
"Maybe I can help, you know."
You just need to communicate.
See this book?
It talks about all the different stages of forgiveness.
"- You know, they say that""s very important."
"- Thank you, sweetie."
"Daddy""s home."
How do I look?
You look great.
Thank you.
Do you like it?
Yeah.
I got some strawberries.
Do you want me to say things?
Dirty things?
Is that what you want?
How does she touch you?
Does she touch you like this?
"Does she let you, you know..."
- Would you like me to try that?
"- Don""t talk, Clara."
"I will try it for you, David."
It might excite me.
"You excite me, David."
See how we fit?
"I can hold you all night, David."
"- I hate it, Clara."
- I love it.
"- Oh, my gosh, y""all!"
"Lt""s beautiful."
- Wait.
"Hold that up higher, honey."
"Nice kicks, by the way."
Where did you get them?
Some place on Melrose.
I'm waiting for these limited-edition Japanese imports.
They've got blue and orange on the side and this red mesh on the soles.
- I had my publicist put me on the list.
- They sound great.
"I could ask her to put you on it too, if you want."
If you don't mind matching.
- No.
Sure.
- Right on.
"I'll need your info, though."
I'm so sorry.
"You're Dr. Phillip, right?"
From Tempest Bay?
- That's me.
"- I know it's completely hicksville,"
- but would you sign my gym bag?
- Sure.
No problem.
Thanks.
"Oh, my God."
My mom's gonna flip out.
Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
"- Too bad it's always moms, right?"
- Yeah.
Bummer.
- He was hitting on me.
- You are so full of yourself.
"Lindsay, no kid talk."
We get enough of that when the nannies take a break.
- Let's talk about the book.
"- Well, I loved it."
You know what else I love?
Hummus.
Couldn't stop thinking about it when they described the Middle Eastern-y part.
Oh.
Hummus.
Fun idea.
Belinda.
"Christine, where's Belinda?"
"Uh, I guess she stepped away."
Ugh.
I am gonna have to let that girl go.
"Oh, but I'm sure she's coming right back."
- Is there anything I can do to help?
- We need hummus.
- And sangria.
"- Ooh, that sounds good."
"Oh, that does sound good."
And roasted red peppers.
"Oh, me make it."
Right.
"Belinda, are you in there?"
I need you.
"Christine, for God's sake, I asked for that sangria a week ago."
- Where's Belinda?
"- Oh, she's not feeling well."
She's lying down.
Probably.
By now.

"Man, them sorry ass cats can't play no ball."

You got pay stubs for me?
Yeah.
"Hey, what's up?"
Any police contact?
Hey.
Any police contact?
"Nah, nah."
All right.

You're doing all right.
I'll see you next week.
All right.

(Angela) Enrique?
"Yeah, in the bathroom, ma."
What are you doing?
What do you mean?
Isn't tonight Michael's school thing?
"Yeah, but I didn't think you were going."
Now you got a hot date.
It's not that big a deal.
Come quickly.
Would you like soup kitchen?
It's not him.
It's alright though.
"He don't like strangers, see."
Don't like a lotta things.
But you took his boat without asking.
Weren't you scared?
One of the soldier's had this kit bag and suddenly it woofed!
It gave us such a fright.
It was a dog.
And one of them Frenches tried to kiss her.
I'm scared now of what your dad might do.
No!
He got himself a bottle.
He thought we'll be back before he woke up.
"Besides, Eric was in Dunkirk."
Eric?
Dad's first-mate.
Got us photographs for our birthday.
Yeah.
He got same birthday.
"Robert Donat in ""The 39 Steps""... and John Clements in ""The Four Feathers""."
Have you ever met John Clements?
No.
I haven't.
Those ones are mum's.
We don't know who he is.
Oh!
I did meet him.
Is there going to be a film?
Probably not.
- Hi.
"- No, thanks."
Why not?
"If I let you, it'll cost me more."
"All right, all right, fair enough."
"How about if I can get you to say the word ""seventeen""?"
"I bet I can get you to say ""seventeen,"" and if I do, you have to join us."
- You're on.
- All right.
- What's two plus two?
- Four.
- Four plus four?
- Eight.
- Eight plus eight?
- Sixteen.
"See, I told you I could get you to say ""sixteen."""
"- No, you said ""sevente""..."
- See?
What?
You walked right into that one.
"Okay, I'm impressed."
"All right, you can buy me a drink now."
- All right.
- What's going on here?
Mr. Heller.
"Gary, you... know this one?"
Ms. Keyes works for me.
Really?
Give your HR person a bonus.
"All right, all right."
What are you doing here?
I live right around the corner.
"Uh, with a ""v"" and a lot of dollar marks."
And this one from mayor hoffman and the board of aldermen.
Jim!
I just saw old drew in the lobby.
How do you know it was him?
"Well, he looks like a runt pickle and he's got an old umbrella stick with a goose-head handle."
That's him!
I knew it!
Bellboy?
"Yes, sir."
Go and tell mr.
Fisk that mr.
Daniel drew is waiting to see him.
"Yes, sir."

It's mr.
"Daniel drew, sir."
Oh.
Here.
Tell him i'm busy.
"Yes, sir."
"Dale, go!"
Well ...
Lord.
"No, it's not real."
It seems to me.
Rory had to pee with laughter.
How do you know?
It looks real.
"Come on, it's a reality."
There are millions of people watching us right now.
Addons Now that the penalty completed.
Back to the game.
- What are you doing?
- Shut up!
Max!
You'd be annoyed.
"Addons Are you having fun, Max?"
Locked.
Addons Max has violated the rules try to contact with people outside the game.
How can break the rules?
Addons I was in the terms and conditions.
Damn.
Addons I have to take a penalty again.
"No, please."
No more.
"Addons Max, you have to lose a friend."
Lord.
Addons Let us choose to Max.
Addons may not realize it.
Say you're sorry.
Addons Let's see.
They are your friends!
Hooray!
That dog done it.
- He all right?
- Hope so.
"Oh, I beg your pardon, old boy, but haven't you forgotten about the money?"
The gelt?
Please.
Mmm!
"Thank you, sir."
"- Oh, say."
You know something?
- Well?
You'd make a good dog biscuit.
"- What's that, a halter?"
- Yeah.
Hmm.
"Being as I'm working like a horse, I just as well look like one."
There you are.
Now hang on to this.
Is that all?
Did you remember nails?
Nails.
Hammers and saw.
Look.
You bought 'em yourself.
What's the matter with you this morning?
- Nothing.
Get out.
- Mmm.
"Oh, hey, listen-"
There's something we did forget - a medicine kit.
"We need some iodine and quinine, just in case."
Oh.
* Got the devil to pay
* Living in a great big way
* Got a snap in my fingers
* Got a rhythm in my walk

[tapping continues]
[piano music] [tapping continues]
[music continues]
"Did you hear, what the lady said?"
"Not exactly, what did she say?"
She said
* I got a snap in my fingers.
And.
* And a rhythm in my walk.
You don't tell me.
* As the elephant say
* I'm livin' in a great big way *
"Oh, get away from here."
That's too much.
* I got a handful of nothin'
What?
* But I peep at it like a hawk.
Peep at nothin'?
* I'm doing okay livin' in a great big way *
Tell me more.
Tell me more.
They're up there!
Goddamn!
We've lost the package.
Secure the exits.
- Which Way's this go?
- West Wing.
"Run, Mr. President!"
Move!
Move!
This leads to the basement.
"- We 're in the stairwell, coming your way."
- Shit.
We gotta go!
"Elevator's here, let's go!"
Shit!
God!
They're in the elevator heading up!
- Cut them off in the Central Hall!
- What are you doing?
Get him!
Take care of Bobby.
"- Killick, stop them at the elevator."
- I'm on it.
He's in the residence!
Cut him off at the residence!
Son of a bitch!
"You screwed us, Walker."
You've got one of your guys running around.
- Not one of my guys.
- Then who is he?
"I don't know, probably some schmuck from one of the tours."
Your tourist killed one of my best men!
"Yeah, how do we know we're not asking a ballerina, or a lawyer, or a math teacher to take off her clothes?"
We just got to go for it.
"Frank, I think I need to see the money."
"Excuse me, miss, do you have a minute?"
"Uh, ma'am?"
Get out of my way.
Excuse me.
Yes?
Are you a prostitute?
What?
Will you take your clothes off for $103.62?
"Thanks, Kevin."
What?
What'd I do?
-You all right?
-No.
"Psst, psst, psst."
Guys...
You guys need some help?
Are you talking to us?
Yeah.
We want to see a naked lady.
"Ooh, how much money you got?"
$103.62.
Really?
That'll do it.
Come on.
Right through here.
"Come on, come on, come on."
Where?
There are naked women in here?
"Guys, you got to trust me."
He got married when he was 21.
There's no evidence he ever cheated on his wife.
Too bad we're not running in France.
We could really nail him on that one.
When do you have your lunch with him?
With Shelly Runyon?
I'm not having lunch with him.
"Friday, 1:00."
It's scheduled tomorrow.
It's automatic.
He's committee chairman.
It was set up.
S.O.P.
- Laine.
- Shelly.
I'm sorry I started.
You were late.
"- I'm not too late, I hope."
- A minute or two.
- Were you tied up with anything?
"- No, sorry."
I'm just late.
"- Hi, Clem."
You too.
"- Senator, nice to see you."
- I ordered you the porterhouse.
"- No, I don't eat meat."
- I'll have the penne.
- You should really...
Mmm.
- Try the steak.
Ask Hugo to burn it on the outside.
- No.
- Thanks for your help.
- Yeah.
Big and ugly.
"Man, this case is just getting better and better."
"If Taggot picked her up, she's probably at his place."
Doubtful.
He's married.
I know.
Right?
Why don't you take the lead on this one?
- Really?
- Sure.
What are you doing?
"Uh, exercise."
I'll meet you up there.
We just need to ask you a few questions about last night.
I'm a little drugged.
Pain killers.
Right.
"Well, this won't take long."
How well do you know off--
How well do you know Officer Taggot?
- Who?
- Officer Taggot.
He your boyfriend?
"No, no."
Then why did he pick you up last night from the hospital?
"That's right, we know about that."
He just--he felt bad that I got hurt.
"Valerie, hey, whoa!"
Focus...
"Repeat, we are at Code Red."
Recon plan Charlie.
Execute!
Let's move!
"Move, move, move, move!"
Yeah!
"Okay, come on, kids."
Everyone in the living room.
It's almost time for the presents.
"All right, gangway, gangway."
And this is how we find out what is in those presents.
"Okay, who's hungry?"
Here come the chips!
I've got Cool Ranch and barbecue!
What in the world...
Oh!
I thought I told him to pick these up.
Shouldn't they be there by now?
What's taking them so long?
"Hey, these guys are professionals."
They're the best.
Come on!
They're not lying down on the job.
Go on without me!
Just go!
A good soldier never leaves a man behind.
"Okay, everybody, come on."
Everybody settle down.
"Now, kids."
Everybody...
You sit in a circle.
"No, Andy."
Karate-chop me or something!
That is not...
Okay.
All right.
Let's just do one simple move.
Okay.
"Now, this won't wrinkle my top, will it?"
Ohh!
Wow.
That was actually fun!
Show me one more time.
"Oh, no!"
"Oh, my gosh."
I thought I lost you again.
"Wait, wait, wait."
Back up.
Again?
"Oh, yeah, when we almost got killed,"
I thought I lost my phone.
It was really scary.
"Mentos-pramp-climb, test number two."
"Lesson learned... when pressure builds to dangerous levels, it must be released."
Is your lip getting better or your face getting redder?
Just gonna pop into the family room.
What the hell was that?
!
"Oh, I'm just getting started!"
Ohh!
Why do you have to be such a silly...
"Haley, stop!"
Mom!
"Phil, honey."
"- Yes, fine, thanks."
Hello.
"Oh, hello!"
Your first night with no phone wasn't too hard?
It was.
But I made an effort...
"Sorry, I must have seemed ridiculous yesterday, right?"
No.
Sometimes people blow it.
I saw you had a car.
Are you going back to Bordeaux?
Yes!
"Oh, yes!"
I'm leaving...
Oh dear!
In 5 minutes.
Could you handle a stowaway?
"I've a son, Louis, who lives abroad."
The rebel of the family.
"At 18, with a culinary arts diploma, he went off to Asia."
He's in Vietnam now.
I tried to stop him.
Well... in my own way.
"Now he's opened a restaurant, and is doing well."
His taste for adventure doesn't come from me.
- Is Vietnam nice?
- I've never been there.
Even to see him.
I'm a disgrace.
"Stupid, isn't it?"
Am I boring you?
Yes.
The End.
I'm pretty sure that's cheating.
Ha.
"It worked, didn't it?"
Hmm.
Who's next in our little contest?
Oh.
Has anyone seen the mice?
Are we there yet?
- Ha.
- Okay.
I think it's time for a story that's actually scary.
Pff.
"Yeah, whatever."
Whoop.
"Pshh, pshh, pshh."
You had your chance.
"Now, then..."
Something beyond comprehension was happening to a little boy on this street... in this house.
A man had come as a last resort.
Because... no one else would go near the place.
Gah!
I hear you've been expecting me.
- You are the...
- That's right.
I am... the babysitter.
"Yes, sir, yes, thank goodness you've come."
My boy.
I don't know what's gotten into him.
I've-a never seen anything like it.
"Trust me, buddy."
I've got three little ogres at home.
"Take a look, Aunt Rosa."
"On the bench, next to Mom's purse..."
- Yes?
- There's a man's bag and hat.
So what?
Lots of men in Marseille wear hats.
Marseille?
When were we in Marseille?
"What do you mean, Marseille?"
"I told you, this is Paris."
You just said Marseille.
"I made a mistake, so what?"
I'm not feeling well.
- Just tell us who took the picture.
- I did!
"Don't be angry, Aunt Rosa."
When Morn and Dorona came you'd just had surgery.
You couldn't have taken it.
What surgery?
- Eye surgery.
- Oh...
But that wasn't then.
"I'm telling you, I took the picture."
Then your mom photographed me with Doborobon-.
I'll show you.
- What?
- Your whole hat theory...
I feel like an idiot.
Why does she call me Doborobon?
It's been half an hour.
She fell asleep.
"Check her, maybe she's dead."
- 7:20.
- Bob Landers set him up.

He's in a staff meeting right now.

He's on the move.
Have a nice day.

Oh!
We know you set up George Salt.
Got him to work early for a meeting that didn't exist.
"Listen, they said if people start to ask questions, not to say anything, and if I did, they would kill me."
And George.
"Please, they're watching."
- Who?
"- I don't know exactly, but they are."
- No one's seen you here.
"- Look, you don't understand..."
"Look, we got to move fast before someone does see you."
- Where's your car?
- It's in the lot down the street.

Okay.
You're gonna walk there.
Calm.
Like you're going to a meeting.
Gonna drive to 1220 Summer Street.
Park on level four.
Congratulations.
"Well, thank you."
Hey.
Hey.
So we made an A.
Did we really?
Yeah.
Yeah.
"It's cool, right?"
Congratulations.
It was the best grade in the class.
Thank you.
"Also, I made you something."
"I sensed a bit of reluctance on your part to embrace the cheese that is power metal, so it's your very own power metal mix."
Wow.
It's actually...
"You said, ""Parking lot mix"" on here."
"It's like heavy metal parking lot, you know?"
Do I have to listen to it in a parking lot?
"No, cars, bedrooms, whatever."
Bedrooms.
Wow!
Sweet.
Whatever.
Anyway.
But it was nice seeing you.
I'll see you around.
"Well, I appreciate it."
"Bye, guys."
Yeah.
Thank you.
Cheers.
just stand still.
Papi!
Stop it!
"Papi, please stop!"
Shh.
Papi!
"Stop, stop."
I fucking love you.
I'm not going to let you do this to yourself.
"Be strong, be strong."
There you go.
There you go...
beautiful man.
"Viente nueve, trienta."
You got 30 pills here.
And you got the testosterone blocker.
Okay?
Otherwise you be growing a beard with tetas.
You don't want that.
That should take care of you for the month.
Anything else?
Um...
"Oh, you wanna get pumped... huh?"
You got the coins?
"Yo, damn, that needle's big."
I can't believe you doing this shit.
The price you pay for beauty.
"You want some, too?"
"I'm just here for moral support, mama."
You want anything on top?
"No, Papi would kill me."
"Okay, just the culo?"
"- Damn right, it's an error."
POLICE OFFICER:
Unless he set you up.
- (GUN CLICKS)
"- Hands above your head, please, miss."
Wait.
Why?
Possession of stolen goods.
He left you holding.
I have nothing.
"Sorry to tell you, but your boy took off."
Probably in Canada by now.
He called in a tip.
Told us to take a look at the surveillance footage at the train station.
Give me the watch.
Now!
You know your rights?
EMMA:
Yeah.
Good girl.
Turn around.
Where's the rest of the watches?
Gone.
They're not coming back.
Let's go.
EMMA:
"So, it's just in here somewhere."
HOOK:
Allegedly.
"Give me a boost, would you, love?"
So I can't see what you're pocketing?
No way.
Stop before I blush.
Actually I need your help.
I want to break up with my Thai boyfriend.
Ok and then?
He can't speak English and I can't speak Thai.
You guys can't even talk to each other and how did you get together?
You know S-E-X?
It's all about SEX.
Because sex is my life.
Okay enough.
I got it.
Thank you Tutor Pleng.
For what?
For agreeing to help me breaking up with him.
Oh no!
I didn't say I would.
But...
I got you this Louis Vuitton bag for you.
Oh yeah
Breaking up with the guy is so easy.
Don't worry.
Thank you
I grabbed it already.
You have good taste.
One original mocha ice blended please.
Oh!
I'm sorry.
You have a problem?
What are you looking at?
Do I look like your husband?
Gym?
Kaya's boyfriend?
Finished.
Just do some cardio.
I got to train 'cause I took a fight.
You did what?
I took a fight.
It's in Fresno next week.
Are you out of your fucking mind?
You put yourself in a bad situation.
"Hey, listen, I can train here or somewhere else."
It's up to you.
- I'll leave right now.
"- Oh, will you?"
"What do you think this is, huh?"
You making a fucking...
You making a choice here?
You're making a big fucking mistake.
You understand me?
You're gonna fuck everything up.
I'll fucking leave right now.
"Oh, yeah?"
Give me the fucking word.
Okay.
Ground only.
No fucking striking.
Got it?
Give me the gloves.
Ground only.
Fucking Fresno.
[Gloves thud]
Fucking idiot.
Here you go.
[Lounge music playing]
You are too... a child.
It's dangerous to go alone!
I wonder if it is God's messenger.
Kill me...
I beg you....
Kill me...
This are the demon seeds...
Before they birth...
Kill me I beg you!
This is terrible....
Terrible...
Please stop it!
Don't look away.
Pray!
You prayed for help...
You must believe until the end...
But...
If you pray...
Pray for death!
Devil!
Shoot!
Gambo.
Thank you!
What....?
Explain it!
What is this white bear?
I think....
You may not believe it...
"Well, when you get discharged... what will you do?"
"Jin-san has been here for so long, he well deserves a big payroll."
If that's so...
It's good.
Oh my!
It's so hot outside!
And these things I bought are so heavy!
Sis?
"Sis, why?"
What happened?
.
Why am I being like this?
What's the matter?
.
Come here.
"Don't cry sis, it doesn't look good on you."
"Because of my jealousy, because of my suspicions, I'm turning into something else."
"If I keep on being like this, Migs wouldn't like me."
"Come on Sis, you know you're not really like that, right?"
.
I'm already choking Migs.
"I've smothered him so much,"
"You know, it's like this Sis don't put him on a leash."
He has to be with you because he loves you.
Right?
Come on!
Brother Migs!
Happy Birthday!
"By the way, my sister left your cell phone."
She told me to give it to you.
Wait a second okay?
.
Brother!
-Who's that girl?
-I'm your wife!
"Bela, what's this?"
"She can't recognise anyone, she can't speak."
What did the doctor say?
That there's no hope.
- The doctor said that?
- Yes.
Who's watching her?
"My mother, the neighbours, the family, my young uncle."
Your young uncle?
He's called in three times.
His holidays are over.
My grandmother's better.
How old is she?
100... 150... 100 or 150?
100.
Special rate?
Yes.
"After one hundred, the rest doesn't matter."
Do you know that or not?
I don't know.
"We grow old, you know."
"I have to go, I have exams."
I'll be back.
Come back quickly.
Don't forget.
"Hello, Tajdolat."
"Hello, are you well?"
Are you looking for something?
My camera.
We left it here and it's gone.
You didn't lock the car.
"One night has passed, you expect it to be there?"
"Hello, good luck."
Eat.
O-Waka-chan!
Matsuki-chan!
O-ume you are not quite good.
Right?
I'll go see.
Sada-don!
Sadakichi-don!
Yes.
Where's the fire?
There's anyone on the rooftop?
I'm on my way.
It's in the Honjo district.
You know?
Also the wind comes from the northwest.
Don't worry.
Matsuki-san?
The son of the neighbor!
Isn't he?
!
The love of Matsuki-san for fire will give him trouble.
Right?
Matsuki!
Where did he go?
Told you to keep an eye on him if the fire bell was heard.
Where did the keeper go?
Send people to the fire chief place.
Tell him I said not to let him in to the place of fire.
It took a lot of dealing.
You heard it?
"Dear, will you talk about that again?"
It's because Naritaya-san has a reputation of being meticulous.
Alex Dolgin is so busy?
I'm Jonathan from the junior company.
I'll be reading Reno Laroire.
Would you like something to drink?
"No, thank you."
This is my brother-in-law.
Hello.
- Hello.
"And this is Goni, his daughter."
Hi.
Jonathan.
"- Yeah, I heard."
So the actors are coming at 12:00?
"Yes, so we should hurry."
At one there's a small reception for the new season.
Only one hour for the reading?
"That's what we were told, Mr. Ben-Shmuel."
Call him Yitzhak.
"It's just the first act, Daddy."
It's ridiculous.
- I'll talk to Alex.
"No, I'll talk to him."
Things must be done properly.
"Yitzhak, please don't be stressed."
"""Don't be stressed."""
Where is the rehearsal?
In the makeup room?
"Yes, at the end of the hall."
I'm going home.
I told you this would happen.
I'm going to talk to Alex.
Sit with Dad and calm him down.
"Uh, um..."
OK.
I've done the catheterization.
"Yeah, no, I wasn't talking to you."
"Hey, Sam."
You two know each other.
"Yeah, that's right."
"Biblically, even."
We dated.
We did not date.
We were in love.
Or at least I was.
I'm really sorry about Stephanie.
Sam...
"Hey, sweetie."
- I don't want to.
I can't.
- I know.
- Not without Stephanie...
- I know.
I don't want to go on.
"I know, listen:"
"I gotta tell ya,"
"I have never been afraid of anything my entire life, except for your father."
"So I have got to go in and look for blockages and try to fix them so he doesn't kill me, OK?"
"OK, let's do this."
Alright...
"OK, Dr. Conner, you are looking at perfectly healthy arteries."
There's no blockages here.
So it's not a heart attack.
No.
"OK, let's check the ventricles."
Wu-tang!
"Good morning, Master Law!"
Jun-kit...
Our students used to learn kung-fu as Shaolin monks.
Any better now?
"Yes, Master!"
Fung-wu!
Do all our students understand the mystery of the sword?
"Yes, Master!"
They all understand!
"Good morning, Master Law!"
Let's get together tonight at the old place.
I'll be the host.
"No, I should be the host!"
I will be the host!
I'll be the host!
I've told you I'll be the host!
I'll be the host!
Don't argue!
No...
I will!
Don't argue!
"I'll be the host, do you hear?"
Fung-wu...
What's happened to you?
There's nothing to argue about!
Don't snatch!
Who's the host really?
I am!
I am!
"Fung-wu, try to use our sword skills!"
"Jun-kit, attack him with the Shaolin fist!"
Together forever.
Together forever.
Together forever.
- Hey...
So what's up?
- Together forever.
I think we both may have said some things I might regret.
- Together forever!
"- Gosh, your eye is pretty!"
"Look, I know you're upset, so..."
Aah!
Why don't we just sit down... and discuss this?
Then... they ate me!
"Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee!"
They're gonna do that all the way home.
I...
I gotta go.
They're my ride.
Wait a minute.
"If they ate you, how is it that you're still here?"
Did you not say this was a true story?
Um...
"You made it up, didn't ya?"
"I... hey, look!"
Lord Farquaad's ghost!
Aah!
Doody heads!
And then there were three.
Who else wants to step up?
"I, too, have a terrifying tale to tell."
It was a dark and stormy night!
Hey... what the...
- Will I?
"- Yeah, totally."
"You've got the pony bug now, and there's no cure for that."
- Granddaughter 1 returns.
- That's my girl.
Back in time for dinner.
"Okay, I've had the most insane day."
I don't know where to start.
Uh...
"Sam, she asked me to help with Raven, he's a horse."
"And Pin was like, ""Back off, tourist."""
- And I...
- You've been at the stables?
"It sounds like you had fun, whatever you were doing."
Everybody's actually kind of cool.
Apart from Mia...
I don't want you riding.
What?
Why?
Because I need you keeping an eye on Rosie.
- She could come with me.
- Rosie at a stable?
I don't think so.
Okay.
It's fine.
She doesn't have to be with me the whole time.
This isn't up for discussion.
I've got enough to worry about with Gramps and your dad and...
Just... promise me.
No riding.
Sure.
No riding.
And she became a billionaire.
Weren't you going to call Philip?
- Who do we know with money?
"- Philip, Jonas and Tommy."
Why?
We'II do what Anna Nicole Smith did.
Hook a guy with money.
- Sounds a bit risky to me.
- What else can we do?
Move to Virum and end up like Vanessa?
Add Bjarke to the list.
He's dying to screw me.
- Patricia?
- Sofie?
Where have you been?
- What happened?
- Simon's been really worried.
- I've been sleeping in the park.
- Why?
- I said no and that's that.
- I'm sick of you.
You never think of anyone but yourself and I'm sick of school...
I hate you.
"Stop it, Simon."
"I am not in the mood, OK?"
- She looks just like you.
- You creep!
You'd be great in porn.
You fuck just like her.
Didn't you hear mum?
She totally lost it.
What did she say?
- Let's have a look.
- There's fighting outside.
I haven't fought!
Please don't misunderstand me!
I just came to stop the fight.
He's fantastic!
Fantastic!
"I can't fight, I'm innocent."
You've cheated me.
Now you have taken my girls.
I haven't!
You don't have to deny it.
I understand!
Good!
Wu-tang will not lose to your Shaolin fist.
Shaolin?
Wu-tang?
What a minor art!
Are you really good at kung-fu?
He's inferior to you!
Please excuse me!
Thanks!
Shaolin won't lose to you Wu-tang.
"Jun-kit, you want to compete with me?"
Good...
let them compete!
"Sure, if you're interested!"
Good fist!
Watch out!
Shaolin Chin Kang Fist is not bad.
But now watch mine!
Are you alright?
Guess he wasn't a person after all.
"V, Cash said that you took the money."
That's not true.
"I, I believe you, but... you got to tell Waltzer in person."
Um...
"T ell me where you are, and I'll come to you."
V?
Got to...
"Oh, shit."
Got to get out of here.
Okay.
Oh!
Excuse me.
"Sorry, excuse me."
Thank you.
Who do I need to find?
What am I doing?
"Uh, Dad."
Dad.
Find Dad.
"Um, excuse me."
I'm looking for Frank's father.
He's a teacher here.
"Oh, what's his goddamn name?"
"His name is, um..."
T om.
"T om, that's his name."
...the edges on the sedge.
That's one of the ways you can tell-- sedges have edges.

No.

"Look at me, Jacob!"
Don't you see that there is a point to all of this?
"You have a responsibility here, Jacob."
Do I have to live on the other side of the world to get your help?
"Hi, Anna."
It's Jacob.
Would you please call me?
I need to speak to you.
Call as soon as you can.
I'm leaving now.
I have to go take care of my hubbie.
Anna?
Is something wrong?
- Can I sleep here?
"- Yes, of course."
"Anna, what happened?"
There.
- Hello.
"- Mrs. Shaw, it's Jacob."
"- Hi, Jacob."
Want to talk to Pramod?
"- No, just let him sleep."
"- So let's sit down, and we'll..."
"- Nope, stay on up here."

- [grunting and yelling]
- You're dead!
She's still alive!
"Keep it moving, keep it moving."
"- No, no!"
"- I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead!"
Why are you still talking?
"Yeah, that's right."
Dead men tell no tales.
- [yells]
"- Oh, God!"
You're dead.
And that's self defense... [softly] For moms.

When did you come here?
"Anyway, get out."
"Scared you, didn't I?"
"Scared you, didn't I?"
Get out.
It's been a long time since we were in the bath together.
That's disgusting.
I feel like getting out of here right now.
You're blushing.
You're shy?
Your skin's so thin?
Who's the one that wants to get out?
- Tell me clearly.
- Shuddap.
When we were bathing together while you were young didn't you like to put your legs like this?

It was horrible.

Why did you let one of DI Orwell's stooges in on this?

We're still working it out.

You?
But you are so adorable.
"I know, that's what I keep telling her!"
"I need a good woman, Muffin Man."
"I can help you, Gingy."
How about this one?
- I don't know.
- You like her?
No.
Weird hair.
- How about this one?
- Too skinny.
No!
Don't like it!
OK.
"Well, how about this one?"
Yes!
That's it!
She's perfect.

Good night.
What about the mouth thing we'd talked about?
- Mouth thing?
- I want to show off my new skills.
- Not right now.
- Go to sleep and I'll go to work.
- Can't we just...
"- Okay, I'll back off."
Sleep tight.
- I'm not ready for the tournament.
- You sure aren't.
- Did you give Mia head then?
- You're disrupting my swing!
It just occurred to me.
Try it out.
"If it works, I've got another trick."
- Just a little one.
- Could you open the door a little?
Well put!
It's all about opening the door and ringing the bell.
- Isn't that Mia's brother?
- Mads?
Yes.
"- Hi, Mads."
- Hi.
- Nice guy.
"- Yes, and one hell of a lawyer."
- Hi.
How was your swing?
- Fine.
I just bought a painting marketed as being mouth painted.
Put your hands up.
Would you mind?
Thank you.
How nice to hear from you.
Of course.
"Yes, that shouldn't be too difficult, sir."
You would prefer it in the morning?
By all means.
Yes.
Good night.
I want that in the diplomatic pouch to Lisbon this afternoon.
- And on to Berlin?
- As soon as possible.
Fine.
May I ask you...
It's insurance.
You don't come to us very often.
- Not very.

We're going to be a family again.
Always.
"Marcus,"
Will you take me back?
"well, i don't know."
- That's all right.

Yes.
Oh marcus.

We don't have anything else for you to take.
"Mama, you let them come in here and take whatever they want,"
Because everything i need i already have right here.

"- Oh, hi, Fez."
"- Oh, you wish, baby."
"Why don't you take your ""Hi, Fez"" act and try it on someone else?"
'Cause I don't need it.
"- Nice work, Fez."
- Shut up.
I don't need your accolades.

"I am a joke to you, and an offence to her."
- I had no right to come.
"- Oh, Edward!"
- Where are you going?
- Far enough not to cause her more pain.
Pain?
Oh!
"Go to her, Edward."
"She is just out of her wits, that's all."
(LAUGHS) And so are you.
Go on.
Lucy took him for his money.
My mother's settlement cannot be revoked.
- And a fitting pair they make.
- I was a free man.
"I rode down here to marry you, and marched in upon you like a clumsy brute."
No.
Even now that I am asking for your hand...
- Are you?
- Yes.
And blundering again.
- I love you.
"- Oh, Elinor."
But you will have to ask my mother's consent more gracefully.
"Oh, yes."

"Oh, I am so happy to welcome you."
You said so.
"He gives that appearance, yes."
"But in disturbances of this sort, we can't always be sure."
"No, I'm afraid John has to stay here."
But he can't.
We need him.

I must take him home.
You'd only be taking home his body.
His mind is...
Look for yourself.
I hope that ending was properly terrifying.

"No, hang on, Cumber..."
"Oh, that way, oh yes!"
"So, around there."
Cumber...
And then...
- I don't know.
It's OK.
I've got my badges.
- Why?
"- Look, all I know is that... that there was a girl, some stripper who worked in Soho."
"Freddie Lau stole her from Grey, and Grey went mental."
- Kayleigh Fenchurch?
"- Stop the machine, I'm dying here!"
Come on.
"One last push, JC."
Huh?
"He was wearing a barman's outfit when he came in, wasn't he?"
Try the King's Oak in Chinatown.
Cough fit.
It's all the rage in LA.
I need to see Lily-Anne.
"- It's not gonna happen, Grey."
- Why?
"What do you mean, why?"
You're the prime suspect in her father's murder.
I need her help to get me out of it.
Time is running out for me.
Like it was running out for poor Freddie.
Either she helps me get out of here or they're gonna catch me.
And I will not keep my mouth shut.
All right?
- There you are.
"- Thank you, Stan."
Kevin Grey is now working in Kinzoku.
Lily-Anne Lau's karaoke bar.
- Who's that?
- No-one.
- No!
"- I don't need to go to a doctor, no."
"- Meemaw, Meemaw..."
"- No, no, no."
"- Meemaw, I promised..."
"I promised my mom that I would take you to the doctor, okay?"
Okay.
Then I'm gonna drive.
"You're not gonna drive, Meemaw."
- I'm gonna drive.
- No.
Too many DUls.
"Hey, scoot over, four eyes."
- Oh...
"- Come on, come on."
"- Martha, just..."
- But you're not...
You're not on my insurance policy.
"Oh, we won't tell anybody."
"Well, legally, I have to call the police if you drive."
"Legal, schmegal."
"Move over, honey."
Wow.
Ten years I haven't driven.
"Chip, what's new?"
What's happening at the Arby's?
"Uh, I don't work there anymore."
I'm a professional clown.
Oh.
"So, that means you're the breadwinner, Martha, darling?"
What do you mean?
"A man shouldn't rely on his wife for money, Chip."
Every young student doctor...
She wanted to know my menstrual history.
I didn't know what she was talking about till she told me.
I felt like a right bleeding'eejit.
"Why didn't she just say ""your periods""?"
"We'll weigh you now, Sharon."
Doctors are always like that.
"""Menstrual history."""
"I got a ""C"" in that in me inter."
How are your movements?
Not bad.
How's yours?
There's the heartbeat now.
See it?
Yeah.
Only one heart.
What?
There aren't twins in there.
"Oh, yeah."
That there is a leg.
See it?
"Oh, yeah."
Sharon?
Why didn't you come in this morning?
Had a checkup.
I swapped with Mona.
You should be on check...
Ask her.
You should be on check-out now.
I can't do it!
Why not?
'Cause I have to keep going to the toilet!
Feel with your fingertips
I can't reach it.
- Don't kill him!
"- Can't just let him live, can I?"
- Please!
"- Weakness, Luke!"
Weakness!
"Gem... come on, you can do it."
Reach.
Tell you what... three bullets left.
50-50 chance of getting a live round.
If he lives...
I'll let him go.
- You want me to sh-shoot him?
"- Wake up, Luke!"
"I'm giving you the chance to save him, or you can point the gun at me, but you'll only get one chance, and if there's no bullet... well... it's all over for you."
"- Please, please don't shoot me."
Please.
"- It's not up to me, sunshine."
"Decision time, Luke."
Me or the fag?
"Either way, it's 50-50."
Time to pick a side.
Five seconds...
Four...
- No!
- Three...
Two...
- One.
"- Please don't, please, Luke, Luke..."
"- No, Gem, Gem, run, run."
- But what about you and Paul?
"Right, let's rest and consolidate."
That's what I want to hear all day.
Call you when I wake up.
Bye.
What are you up to?
Where are you going?
Dinner with Lisa.
What?
I'm a bit hungry too.
I can sleep after dinner.
"You won't go, we're eating at street stalls."
Bullshit!
Who says so?
"I go there often, let's go."
Really?
More beer!
Coming!
"No big deal, I eat this often."
Isn't it better at my home?
Why do this comrade like our HK street stalls?
Cos Lisa likes it.
Why didn't you tell me so?
Why you never ask?
Why do you always talk to me like this?
Bad temper.
Yes...
"I'm bad-tempered, lots of faults."
"But my plus point, likes the famous jockey, Silent Witness,"
I never give up.
Lisa...
Marry me?
He's said it.
Get over agin that wall!
And you're the guy that's been riding me to the nut house!
Stop him!
"Somebody, stop him!"
He's crazy!
Get him away!
Get the warden!
And you're the dirty screw that killed my pal!

MEULLER:
That's for all the guys you beat up and put in the Hole!
And that!
And that!
And this is for Lassiter!
[MEN SILENCE]
[MEN MURMURING]
We're crashing out!
Who's coming with us?
[CHEERING]
Come on!

"Come on, get going."
[MEN YELLING]
"Come on, Ross."
We need ya.
"You're all crazy, men."
Don't try it!
They'll blast you before you get to the gate!
Don't be suckers.
Stay out of it!
"If I didn't know you were stir-nuts, I'd blast ya!"
Was that a person?
Wife
The rat fell into the trap.
"You all right, baby?"
You Okay?
I'm okay.
Come here.
You're okay now?
You're okay now?
Drink up.
Good girl.
Leaveit
I want to tidy up a little.
Leave it.
We've got the shaman to thank for everything.
Get some rest.
You must be exhausted.
Shaman
Damn fool.
Suspect arrested in the mushroom-tonic case...
Victims have developed severe mental derangement...
Mr. Yang E-sam?
Yes.
The landlady was a victim.
"Your uncle must've taken the tonic, too."
It's turned the town upside down.
We've gotta bring him in.
You should get a lawyer.
"After all, he's a victim, too."
What the fuck?
What are you doing here?
Get out.
- How on earth did you find me?
Your beloved boss.
"Fuck you, Cavit!"
Can?
"It's OKauntie, he's a friend..."
"C'mon girl, I need to go shopping!"
I've nothing left to wear.
Nothing?
As if you ever had anything...
I can buy your entire day.
"It's my photo shoot day, with that German."
Why don't you meet him later?
Then you'll get paid twice!
What's going on?
I can't go out during daylight.
Do I need to talk to yourmom?
Fuck you.
My ass is freezing'...
Swimming in November?
!
No whole wheat?
I called yourmom when you left your phone at the bar...
Why is that?
She was one mean woman.
You idiot!
What did you say?
Don't shout!
"All I said was ""Ahmet"", and she was already yelling..."
Sorry...
My mom is a little bit weird.
I'm not in the mood anymore.
Hellooo!
That was a long-ass leg.
Ain't know where the hell I was going with that.
"That's just a long-ass, Wendy Williams-sized leg."
Damn!
It was big--
You ain't been here the whole show?
"You talking about some, ""Damn."""
I've said some fucked-up shit.
"My God, man."
Jump on it.
That shit remind me of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air... when Will Smith and Carlton got in that--all right.
I love Fresh Prince.
That's my show.
"But y'all, I'll be honest with you."
Will Smith does not think I sound like him.
Nope.
"First time I met him, it was weird."
He was like...
"""Yo, Jay, I don't think you can sound like me."""
And I was like...
"""Yo, Will, stop playing."""
"He was like, ""Yeah, that's good."
"""Check it out."
Whoo!
"Miami."""
"He made some good music, man, you know?"
"No, but I was raised mostly on, like,"
Biggie Smalls and Tupac.
That's what I like listening to.
Biggie Smalls is just cool.
Just cool.
¶ First of all I Poppa.
(STOMACH GURGLING)
Just hold that thought and stay right there.
Oh-oh.
(MANSLEY SIGHS)
DEAN:
Little lower.
Little bit lower...
Hey.
I thought you were in trouble.
DEAN:
That sucks.
Let me just...
Up a little.
I had to ditch this weird guy who's staying at our house.
It took me hours to shake him!
I kill myself to get out here!
And you have him doing...
Arts and crafts!
"You got a problem with arts and crafts, little man?"
"He's a giant robot, Dean."
It's a little undignified.
Yeah?
"Well, smart guy, what would you have him do?"
(MAKES ENGINE SOUNDS) Main systems on.
Main engines.
"One, two and three."
All systems go.
"Five, four, three two, one!"
Blast off!
(SCREAMING)
We're landing.
We're landing!
-Don't.
How's the court?
We're digging our own graves here.
"Keep it, Superman."
"Coffee, please."
It's on the house.
-Thanks.
Where's Hakkarainen?
-I told him to get a job.
Said that to the King!
He'd rather kill himself than get a job.
-Let's drink to that!
Hakkarainen is going to jump from the crane!
Buy me a beer when you get down!
What's this?
You're off-duty.
I know him from way back.
Who am I to stop anyone?
"You want to exercise, fine."
Hakkarainen!
"Show us a somersault, faggot!"
You're a mountain lion!
You'll always land on your feet!
A career leap!
Where did the tomato go?
Show us a fucking triple lutz!
Get back or I'll jump!
-No you won't.
"Don't you know your old friends anymore, King?"
Garbage Jesse!
Dammit...
It's been a while.
"I'm gonna set your nephew straight, get him singing like a canary... all's right with the world."
"$10,000."
"10,000."
Cash to you.
I'm not saying to throw the case.
Just... no talking to the DEA.
Are you saying what I think you're saying?
Yes.
What's it going to be?
What?
That dude wouldn't take a bribe?
That dude in there?
Saul Goodman we're talking about?
"""Morally outraged"", he said."
Threatened to call the police.
And Badger's gonna spill?
Like the Exxon Valdez.
So what do we do about it?
"Francesca, how about I follow you home?"
- No!
- For safety!
What?
"God, you are killing me with that booty."
"Talk to me, guys!"
Come on.
Just tell me what you want!
Jesus!
"No, no, no."
No.
It wasn't me!
It was Ignacio!
He's the one!
Why would you be doing that?
You got a really good face.
Bullshit.
Don't give me that.
"No, no, really."
You got some great character--
Who are you doing this for?
Seriously.
"Just for practice, just for the heck of it."
This is what I do.
"I sit here all day, and I draw--"
- You've been here all day?
- ...people as they come by.
"All day, yeah."
"And you draw other people, too."
"- Yeah, plenty of them."
- Let me see.
I can't because actually I gave them the pictures.
Would you like your picture?
- You'll give it to me?
- Absolutely.
Here we go.
All yours.
Enjoy.
Okay.
"Sorry about that, man."
You just never know.
- You know what I mean?
- It's not a problem.
- Enjoy it.
"- Okay, buddy."
I haven't stuttered once in over six weeks.
- Skip the captain.
Where is he?
"He's been holed up at my place, until two days ago. I ain't seen him since."
- Who else has he seen here?
"- No one, that is, ex cept her."
The Chandler doll?
What's she like?
She's tops.
"With him, with everyone."
- When did he last see her?
- l don't know that.
"Just bef ore he left my place, he gave me a letter f or you."
What are you waiting f or?
Give it to me.
- Come on.
Where is it?
- Here.
- Hand it over.
Give it to me.
- Go on and give it to him.
Not here.
Tomorrow morning at your hotel.
"- l have that table f or you, f riend."
- l didn't want a table.
"Sorry, sir."
My mistake.
There was something about him I didn't like.
"Maybe his calling me ""friend."""
"Evening, Mrs. Chandler."
A Ramos gin fizz?
Nobody can make them the way you can.
Thank you very much.
What is it?
The Ark.
If it is there at Tanis...
Then it is something men was not meant to disturb.
Death has always surrounded it.
It is not of this earth.
Do we need the monkey?
"I'm surprised at you Jones, Talking that way about our baby."
He's got your looks too.
And your brain...
"I noticed it, she's a smart little thing, smart!"
Hey!
where are you going?
"She'll be all right, have a date."
"Come on, come on..."
Marion!
What's this?
It's a Date.
You eat 'em.
Sieg Heil!
Ja.
Sieg Heil.
Ist Nae.
"Ja, ja."
"How come you haven't found some nice girl to settle down with, raise eight or nine kids like your friend Sallah?"
Who says I haven't?
"Ha, ha!"
I do.
Dad had you figured a long time ago.
He said you were a bum.
"Oh, he's being generous."
The most gifted bum he ever trained.
At least you had an idea.
I didn't know which goddamn way
To go.
Yeah.
"You know, Lou, you know when"
"I get stuck like that, there's"
Only two people who's lead I'd
Follow in a heartbeat.
That's you and Tommy.
"You've saved my ass, goddamn I"
Don't even know how many times.
So tonight you didn't.
Yeah.
"That's all you gotta say,"
Is yeah?
Uh-Huh?
"No sweat, man."
"Hey, buddy."
Where's the mustard?
Thanks very much.
"You know something, pal?"
"You got to lose, like, 75 pounds."
"Seriously, bro."
If I got to pull you out of a
"Fire, it's gonna be awful slow"
Going.
Juice.
"Hey, lady."
"Wow, that's a really ugly baby."
"I mean, I'm sure she's gonna"
Grow up to be a very gorgeous
"Person one day, but there's no"
Yeah.
"And when you're 15,"
I'll teach you how to roll your own.
"Wink, wink."
"Cleveland, you've worked enough to go on the cruise."
(goofy grunting)
Now it's time to put those pills away and get some rest.
Nuh-uh!
There's still days before this cruise.
"I can keep working and have weeks, maybe even months off!"
Months!
Do you know how long a month is?
"I'm asking you a question, Donna!"
"Ah, forget it!"
The pills will tell me.
(crazy laughter)
That man's a mess.
"Howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy!"
Let's see.
Hmm.
How many Mega Energy Pills can I get for... this?
(grunts)
"This says: ""Happy birthday, Rallo, from Grandma."""
(grunts)
"And this is a Post-it note that says: ""One hundred dollars."""
Is it hot?
It's hot in here.
Are you hot?
I'm hot.
"Guy back there taking a long time with them pills, huh?"
!
"Sorry, sir."
Hallelujah.
Auf Wiedersehen.
I'll see you around.
- You okay?
- Sure.
Is this what you really want?
Do I have a choice?
Molly?
"Molly, do you know where you are?"
You're in the hospital.
You were hit by a car.
We're taking very good care of you.
You like my ring?
"I know you're scared, but I'll stay with you."
We called your parents.
They'll be here very soon.
"Okay, let's extubate her."
Carter....
- What's her tidal volume?
-500 ccs.
Gases are good.
All right.
Excellent.
- We're gonna take this tube out.
- Squeeze my hand.
Make sure the cuff is down before you extubate her.
Good.
"Now, what I want you to do is pretend you're blowing out your birthday candles."
Take another big breath.
"When I say go, blow out real hard, okay?"
Go.
- Nice.
"Rose, I'm his only chance."
Let's go.
- You workin' with the feds?
- No.
- IA?
- No.
You're alone.
Let's go.
"- Oh, shit."
- All right.
Get down.
Get down.
"- Oh, shit."
- And stay down.
Shit.
"Bill, where are you?"
"Bill, if you read, we're going back to the station."
You gonna keep me in here?
You gonna keep me in here with cuffs?
"- You don't know what you're doing, do you?"
- Shut up.
"You don't have a clue as to what the fuck is going on, do you, Sheriff?"
"Bill, do you copy?"
"Bill, do you read?"
"- It's just club soda, Freddy."
- Finish it.
"- Hey, Ray."
"- Hey, Freddy."
I came to tell you I found Superboy... and I'm bringing him in tomorrow morning... and I'd like you to come with me.
I owe you that much.
"He's a fugitive, Ray, and he's convinced you're tryin' to kill him."
"Just tell me where he is, Freddy."
"Oh, yes..."
I am.
"- Hey, douche bag, get out of there!"
- What does this mean?
"- Come on, fuckface!"
"- Alright, pig... get out here!"
Come on!
"- Come on, come on!"
- Get out here.
"Don't hurt me, I'm just a poor college student!"
"Poor, poor?"
Then we'll find someone who'll pay for you.
"No, not my mother!"
"Please, not my mother."
"- Guys, what should we do?"
- Let's knock him off!
"No, no."
Please!
I'll give you everything I have!
- Like what?
"- Everything, everything."
Candies?
"No, I don't like breath mints."
This linen handkerchief.
My mother gave it to me for my birthday.
- It's not worth anything.
- Come on.
Come on!
I have 16.600 liras to last me to the end of the month.
- I'll take that.
- What about me?
You get nothing!
- I just got a daughter.
- Congratulations.
- Do you have a wife?
- No.
- You haven't married?
- No.
A girlfriend?
No.
- Is it rude of me to ask?
"- No, no."
- Why don't I get that wine?
- Good idea.
"When I went home, I thought you would follow me."
I thought so too.
I thought you would come back.
You did?
But we didn't.
We should go to India.
- Why?
- It's warm.
They've got good hotels.
Stop it.
Why?
Look at this apartment.
We're lying on a mattress.
There's lots to do.
- It doesn't matter.
- It does.
- And we're going to Val d'lsere.
"- We can go there, but not India?"
Give me a break.
"Ever since you met your real, holy father   you've been really irritating to be with."
Hello?
Yes I'm fine.
Normal.
Hear about what?
Of course I've read the newspapers.
"Yes, I'll wait."
Luisa.
I prefer to meet Laura by myself.
As you want.
Yes.
Yesterday.
Almost at eight.
Sometimes I heard him saying at dusk time.
When I walked in the terrace door was opened.
"When I saw it, I knew what happened."
Soon people screamed.
Windows opened.
Everybody showed up.
They said someone fell out.
As I was going up in the elevator he was falling down.
Did he try it before?
Never.
I was scared of him doing it before.
But he was fine now.
You know they had to confine him.
He told me the day we met.
He was very good now.
But I have an idea that comes to my mind.
Julian wanted to win.
To win?
Why don't we leave?
I'm afraid of people coming here.
"Eddie, don't..."
Can you...
I got to go.
"[click, dial tone]"
Fuck.
Fuck.
[spit] [flush]
"You were in there a while, Eddie."
I was just...
I don't know how many times I got to tell you guys.
"If it's a big one, take it upstairs."
"Christ, did you even spray?"
- No.
There was...
- Look at you.
You look like shit.
- Yeah.
- What's going on?
- I feel...
"- What is it, first night back jitters or something?"
- Maybe.
Maybe.
- All right.
"Well, just relax, okay?"
This is probably inevitable.
"Look, I'm gonna put Tate on the big table."
You can deal razz to those English pricks.
- No.
No.
- I'm gonna ease you back in.
"Yeah, that's what we're going to do."
- You sure?
Please don't make a scene.
Where's the restroom?
"Yes, I called him."
When?
Why?
Because.
Want something to eat?
The cafeteria's closed.
He's sleeping.
"It went well, but took a long time."
"We will wake him up soon, to see he's all right."
"Good thing he came in, it was almost too late."
There's a problem with his papers.
- If you don't mind...
- I'll take care of it.
"We almost killed him, and for what?"
My battery's run out.
I need to make a call.
I need to talk to Raziya.
This whole costume is for her sake.
All because I love her.
What's the sense in hiding all this from her?
You know what she calls Him?
Daddy.
"She calls God ""Daddy"" and me she calls ""Honey""."
Do you need help?
No.
What's your name?
Dorona.
- And your brothers?
"- Natanel, and the little one is Shai."
- There's another one.
"It's the Sunland Arms, apartment 12B."
You'd better hurry.
There's no time to lose.
Her scalp must be in very bad shape.
It is.
(DOORBELL BUZZING)
"(IN FRENCH ACCENT) Oh, uh, hello, I am Wilbert."
Your husband sent me here to make the scalp happy.
"Oh, come in."
It is not easy to come through this little hole.
"Oh, I'm sorry to have kept you out there in that cold hall, honey."
"But, you know, a nice girl can't be too careful."
(COUGHS)
Why don't you take your coat off?
"Oh, no, this is fine, thank you."
"All right, here is the coat."
(COUGHS)
I must find the place to plug in the equipment.
Over there.
"Oh, merci."
(CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY)
(WHIRRING)
"Well, I am now ready to begin."
So am I.
You know something?
What?
You're cute.
Do you know something?
Whisper it in my ear.
The scalp is dry.
Come with me.
Where?
–Damn it!
Open the door!
–Just let go of me!
"Well, maybe I should just let my dick do the talking."
"How about that, huh?"
–Huh?
–Open the goddamn door!
"–Shane, come on!"
–Where is he?
Where is he?
He told me to meet him at the stash house.
–Where?
–Open up!
Come on!
Near the bridge.
"You have no idea what you just missed, darlin'."
–Come on!
–Asshole!
"Couldn't split town before you picked up the merchandise, huh?"
"You were always such an idiot, Fleetwood."
Weren't you?
–You can't arrest me.
"–I'm not here to arrest you, asshole."
–Drop it!
Put that on the ground!
"–You heard him, asshole!"
Now!
Turn around!
Turn around!
"Your girlfriend gave you up, man."
She couldn't resist my charms.
–You found something?
"Hey, man, I don't want to put any kind of pressure on you, but..."
I bet every dime I got on you.
You what?
I guess I got carried away.
No pressure?
You call that no pressure?
Trainer coming through.
Excuse me.
Just take it easy.
Come on.
All right.
Has anyone given him a salt tablet?
No.
Okay.
"I've got your glucose, your dry socks, liniment, bandages."
Bandages?
Bandages?
"- Just relax, okay?"
Relax.
"- Come on, Magnum."
Warm up.
Warm up.
"Yeah, get them legs goin'."
- Get them legs in shape.
"- Two minutes, swimmers."
Two minutes.
"- Oh, no."
- Don't use them too much on the swim...
What?
What do you think you're doing.
I'm sorry.
No one informed me of the dress code.
It's not your fault.
"Still, sorry."
"C'mon, Kim, you gotta pull it tight."
"You forgot this, too."
Where's the candy?
Candy?
Didn't bring one?
"We call condoms ""candies"" here."
Mom.
Mom.
Can you hear me?
What're you doing?
I'm back.
Hey.
I'll go to the immigration office the day after tomorrow.
"Don't worry, they won't detain me for overstaying."
It's not like I entered with a fake passport...
Thank you for calling Juicy Fruits.
"Yes, any girl in particular?"
Ilia?
"Sure, for how long?"
"One hour, got it."
"Yes, no problem."
- Ilia.
- Yes?
You have a booking.
Okay.
"Mom, I'll call you again when I'm about to depart."
"Yes, sorry about that."
I'll get more days off so I can train at the gym.
"Yes, thank you."
"Ilia, it's your last day?"
Tell me.
What are you doing?
- She wants me to buy her flowers.
"- It's not true, Master!"
That's enough...
I'll buy you some then.
"You naughty pair, go!"
It's all your fault!
- Don't behave like that next time!
- It's all your fault!
He asked me to go to the brothel with him.
So you!
Surely you know what kind of man he is by now.
You!
Interesting?
"Mr. Chao, are you satisfied with three girls?"
Not bad... not bad!
"That's fine, enjoy yourself!"
Ah-chuen!
Master!
Reward!
Yes!
"Thanks, sir!"
"Well, let me continue!"
Do you know what's happened to him?
What?
He can't stand it!
Look how happy you are.
"Jun-kit, you should enjoy yourself in this place."
Why are you sitting there like a fool?
"Come on, cheers!"
"Chung-Ian, go and toast to Mr. Hong."
"Don't say a word without a lawyer, even if they beat you."
- Stay strong.
- Not tonight.
Nobody's beating me.
You get out of here.
I don't want you mixed up in this.
"- If i go to jail, I'm goin' alone."
- Wait!
Your money's in your briefcase!
Don't do it!
Don't take that sled.
It's a piece of shit.
Take the 4-40!
Excellent power-to-weight ratio.
- What?
- Two-year unlimited warranty!
- An on board toolkit!
- Okay!
Fine!
This beauty is built for you!
"- Hand warmers, halogen lights!"
- Shut your trap.
I got it!
No!
Pull the choke.
The lines are dry.
"- No, don't flood it."
- You said pull the choke.
Finesse.
Like getting a chick off.
We went over this!

"That's very funny, Shrek, but I know it's you doing this."
"Hey, I..."
"I'm standing right here with you, Donkey."
No way!
This place is not haunted by a ghost!
"And when the sun comes up, Donkey will be the new king of... it's right behind me, isn't it?"
Aah!
- Donkey!
"- Oh, my goodness!"
Aah!
Ha ha ha ha!
Ah...
"Well, that's what I'd call a knight to remember."
What do you say we scare ourselves up some dinner?
I'd say...
"Grab the kids, and let's get going."
And that's why we're the kings of Halloween.
He was so scared.
You probably won't see him for a month.
So what else have you got in your bag of tricks?
Hmm.
I've got seven eggs.
Perfect.
I love this holiday.
Hey!
I am not happy!
Run!
Run for your life!

Keep away!

You're welcome.

It hurts so much!

You missed the birth of our firstborn.
"I did, but I saw the sheets."

"Back-up needed at the King's Head pub, Fairview Avenue."
Hey!
David?
Please just go.
Don't do this.
Talk to me.
David...
I know you weren't at the bank vault.
I followed you to the lock-up...
- I don't care any more.
- Is that where Julie-Ann died?
"If you jump, they'll say you did it."
I didn't!
I'd never hurt her.
But you were her boyfriend and you never came forward.
"David, I know about you and Julie-Ann."
No.
"No, you don't."
She was everything to me.
She...
She was beautiful.
She took away my pain... all of it.
"All I wanted was for us to get away from here, from the estate, the drugs."
From her selling herself.
He thought she was just a junkie with a big mouth.
He didn't know who she was or what she meant to me.
"Oh, look."
The Granola family left this.
- What is that?
- It's a native American dream catcher.
It's supposed to keep all the nightmares out and only let the good dreams in to protect your home.
It's flypaper for nightmares?
Mm-hmm.
- Let's keep it.
- Yeah?
"Hang it where, the car?"
It's not much of a home.
Maybe it's time we get a real place.
Are you saying...
Why not?
We've been on the road long enough.
Maybe it's time we retire the Bonnie and Clyde act.
So I think...
I think it's time.
Together?
- Don't you wanna?
"- Like where, Neverland?"
I'm serious.
We could do this.
Where?
Where?
I'll tell you where.
Close your eyes and point.
Whatever spot you pick... that's our home.
Tallahassee.
We got a winner.
Is it near a beach?
"Yeah, it's Florida."
"Fi, we need to get the biggest armed response we can get at that place."
How big?
Very big.
Jabbar's guys are armed to the teeth
And aren't gonna go down without a fight.
I think I have an idea.
Remember that burner phone we gave your mom?
Hello?
"Mom, I don't have a lot of time."
"I need you to say, in a loud, clear voice,"
"""1212 Bayshore Avenue."
"Yes, Michael, I can be there."""
Are you sure?
I don't know if anybody's told you --
I know Riley bugged the house.
It's what I'm counting on.
I need to get the CIA to show up someplace fast.
Can you do that for me?
"Yes, Michael."
1212 Bayshore Avenue.
I can be there.
"Thanks, Mom."
I'll be in touch when I can.
M-Michael --
"We lost his pulse, Sam!"
What?
I can't find a pulse!
"There's nothing, man."
Nothing.
Nothing.
Do it!
Do it!
Like where?
Neverland?
I'm serious.
We could do this.
Where?
- Where?
I'll tell you where.
- Pfft.
Close your eyes and point.
"Whatever spot you pick, that's our home."
Tallahassee.
We got a winner.
Is it near a beach?
"Yeah, it's Florida."
Everything's near a beach.
"Okay, then."
Tallahassee it is.
Tallahassee it is!
Are you sure?
Is this what you really want?
What I really want is you.
What is that?
It keeps the time.
You have somewhere to be?
We can mark watches.
Take turns sleeping.
"We'll most likely have to walk through the night again, so we should rest while we can."
- I'll take first shift.
- I'll stay up with you.
Okay.
When's the last time you slept?
I don't really sleep now.
Is everything all right?
"Lynn, are you all right?"
You look strange.
Is anything wrong?
I was scared by the lightning and Stan hasn't gotten home yet and I just didn't want to be alone in the house.
When do you expect him?
He didn't say when he'd be back.
I'm terribly sorry.
"But as you probably know, Lynn and I are concerned about Stan."
I had a feeling that something was wrong with Stan.
A hunch.
So I drove out to see if everything was okay.
- I'm sorry.
"- Of course, I understand."
It was nice to see you again.
"Bye-bye, Lynn."
"Douglas, what is it?"
I don't know.
I don't know.
I have a strange feeling something's wrong.
A feeling like I had when Bobby... died.
Stan?
Stan?
Stan is here.
My brother is here.
And he's dead.
My brother is dead.
It could be Bobby.
No.
"No, it's Stan."
Pull yourself together.
He's dead.
"Both of you, out!"
"- But we're waiting for a call, sarge..."
- Look.
Stand by at home.
I will phone you when the call comes in.
Good.
We'll both be at my place.
"I don't care where you are, as long as you're not here."
Got it?
- Right.
- Good.
Good.
"Hey, why your place?"
I want you to see Melinda.
- Melinda?
- Yup.
"Oh, yeah, the one with the sexy feet."
Right.
And you'll get a free introductory lesson to the Poncherello School of Cool.
"Hello, Henry."
"That's a boy, that's a boy."
Feel better?
What do you think I should use?
Do I give her my Redford approach?
"Or maybe I'll be more continental, like Rex Harrison."
I just want to see her feet.
"Well, maybe I'll try my Stallone."
"Hey, hey, come here."
Hey!
"Hey, Ponch."
"Oh, mister, don't open that hood."
"Don't open that hood, whatever you do."
The hell with it.
The hell with you.
"Uh, you know, about the other night."
I don't want there to be--
"Don't even worry about it, man."
Myjaw's not made out of glass.
"Yeah, well, you know, blood's thicker than blonds, right ?"
"So, you got my back on Saturday ?"
Derek...
"I ain't got nobody else, man."
- You got Lip.
- Lip ?
"Man, that fool will get a nigger killed quick, man."
"No, I need you there."
"47th Street, under the El."
"I'll call you, man."
Are you down ?
"- Yeah, I'm down."
"- All right, man."
"Let me get to class, get some education like you."
All right.
Uh... I don't wanna bug you. I just came in here to say good luck.
"So, tomorrow's the big day, huh ?"
Yeah.
- You scared ?
- Shitless.
You got a minute foryour old man ?
I wanna show you something.
Sure.
Be careful.
"That wall, it's, uh, still wet."
"That'syourmother when she was 19, when I fiirst met her."
You didn't eat the turkey sandwich I brought you last night.
I know you must be hungry.
So I...
I've prepared a protein drink and a wonderfully nutritious salad.
"Looks good, doesn't it?"
Doesn't it?
Yes.
You look pale.
- Do you have a fever?
- No.
Let me see.
Watch what you're doing.
Damn it.
I don't have time to change.
It's getting late.
- Are you going out?
"- Yes, I'm going out."
Where?
"Well, let's just say I'm..."
I'm going to make a house call.
What does that mean?
"That's my business, Mrs. Carrington."
Just as I want you to make it your business to clean up that mess.
And to eat something before I get back.
Hello.
I'm Dr. Travers.
"Yes, please come in, you've been expected."
"Why, thank you."
"Anna, please take Dr. Travers' coat."
Thank you very much.
Mrs. Carrington?
Yes.
Get the hell out of here Danny!
You drunk!

- What's wrong with him?
"- Oh, Danny was so mean to him this morning."
I can still totally picture it.
"So it all started when Justin, he woke up."
He was in a great mood.
"He was like, man, I love being in love, man."
I just love it.
Makes me wanna do the moonwalk.
I could do the moonwalk.
I could get jiggy with it.
I could...
I could spin.
I could jump.
I could dance for days and days but I'm not.
I'm just gonna stand completely still.
Completely still.
Still like a stone.
Like a stone.
"And then... and then Danny,"
We pan over to Danny and Danny was all like grrr.
I think love is stupid.
Getting married.
"Getting married, ""pfft""."
That's all like a dumb mistake.
I would never do that.
And I get to be mean to you for just no reason because I'm a big baby.
I'm a big baby.
My hair's too long to be a baby but I act like a baby anyways.
I see.
No nausea?
No vertigo?
Here.
Now?
No.
Not at all.
OK.
I'll be able to send a positive report to the insurance then.
You were lucky.
But I wouldn't recommend these little escapades.
At least not unprepared.
Going out won't kill me?
Your respiratory system and your heart are very weak.
It's summer time.
You were dressed for the North Pole.
Yes.
Well.
Thank you.
Doctor.
Goodbye.
The member you require is no longer connected to Visiocom.
Shit.
"You have selected Eva, but she no longer works here."
Damn!
It's you.
- I'd like to talk to Eva.
She doesn't work here anymore.
I must find her.
- You must do nothing.
You've done enough.
She lost her job.
I'm the friggin' host of the show.
"Oh, okay."
We're being interviewed by a 12 year old.
Hi.
"I'm 14, and my show gets the most hits on Viddimension."
- You dig?
- Yeah.
I dig.
"I guess ""dig's"" back in."
"Now, I hope you noobs are ready 'cause I've played your beta, and I got some serious questions for you guys."
So who's gonna walk me through the demo downloads?
- I hope it's you.
"- Uh, I will."
- Come on.
"Yeah, that's a good idea."
"- Yeah, that's awesome."
Hi.
"Oh, hey, you must be Suzanne."
"I'm Deena, Dave's wife."
Of course.
Really nice to meet you.
Dave's told me so much about you.
"Oh, not too much, I hope."
Hi.
Hey... honey.
What are you doing here?
"- Hi, honey."
- What are you doing here?
"Well, you know, today's a big day for you, so I just, uh--"
I'm--I'm glad you came.
And I finally get to meet the famous Suzanne.
"- I just can't believe it's taken this long-- - oh, it's been really crazy."
A small chill by the column?
"No, a great chill."
"In addition, one is going away to me to melt."
"-Then, it is very urgent."
-It is what I am saying to him.
And if Lella had to be late?
It would be a disaster.
Then I to me leave orders before she is too much behind schedule.
Mother mine!
In fact...!
I am going to eat you!
-A moment.
"Before, undress."
-you quiet...
How long you take in uninformed?
Ever since I was born.
By where one begins?
"Hey, Gloria..."
-Álvaro!
-Lella!
So that is your fiancee.
You pick in your subjects.
And what do you do here?
I had brought you an ice cream for your birthday.
What do you do dressed like this?
You seem one whore.
"Alvaro, I..."
What I do with this?
Not even I like.
To the devil!
Lella.
-By the way?
"Okay, I'll meet you over there."
You got it.
Come on!
Didn't tell me it was this heavy.
Hey!
"Hey, what the fuck are you guys doin' in here, huh?"
"You got a problem, buddy?"
"Uh, no-no problem."
"No, you ain't got no problem, right?"
That's right.
"Just be cool, motherfucker."
"Yo, Bobby..."
"Yo, yo, come here, man."
Hold this one.
Come on.
"Now, I advise you two to take that beer out the trunk of your car."
"And I advise you, smiley, to put that knife away."
You advise?
That's a pretty big word for a nigger.
- Yeah.
"- Oh, fuck!"
[Grunting]
[Box cracking]
"You okay, buddy?"
"Yeah, sure."
"Well, let's get rid of these turkeys and clean up this mess, huh?"
- Hey.
- Hmm?
Thanks.
You okay?
"Yeah, sure."
"Hey, how do you feel about goin' to shoot some pool?"
"Yes, I think."
Thank you!
Thank you?
By words only?
Earlier your smile was beautiful.
Can you smile again?
I don't like to smile!
Really?
"You don't like to smile,"
- or you don't like me?
- Let go of me!
Let me go!
Let me drive you home.
Why do you keep bothering me?
Why?
"It's not bothering, it's love!"
"If I tell you that I don't like you, will you stop what are you doing?"
What you do is not love!
Didn't I tell you that I have a boyfriend already?
So what?
"As long as I like you, I will make you fall in love with me!"
Xiamu...
Xiamu!
Xiamu!
Xiamu!
- Are you allright?
- I'm allright!
Did you get injured?
Don't come near Shu Yawang anymore!
"I come near to her,"
- so what?
- I'll kill you!
Daddy lets us play.
I don't care what your father does.
This is important.
I want you to look at me.
- Alright then.
- Excuse me?
Nothing.
The doctor told me to rest.
And I expect support.
There are some new rules.
I want absolute silence in the house.
I need sleep.
"If it's important, you knock."
And no visitors.
"If someone asks, tell them mom's sick."
We keep the curtains closed.
I need to avoid sunlight.
"You play alone in the garden, very quiet."
You take nothing inside.
"No branches, no animals ..."
What are you doing?
We start over.
Well?
We need to keep this family together.
One for me and one of Luke.
Very nice.
I meant what I just said.
"We're sticking to this plan, huh?"
Good.
Now it's bedtime.
Goodnight.
- She is so different.
I have you.
They're wonderful.
You must let me try one on.
It is good to be working at my trade again.
It's just a pity you have to make them for her.
What is the hatter with me?
Hatter?
(CHAINS RATTLING)
(THUNDER CRASHING)
Hatter.
Have you any idea why a raven is like a writing desk?
"I'm frightened, Alice."
I don't like it in here.
It's terribly crowded.
Have I gone mad?
I'm afraid so.
You're entirely bonkers.
But I'll tell you a secret.
All the best people are.
Here.
That's better.
You look yourself again.
RED QUEEN:
Hat man!
Where are my hats?
I'm not a patient monarch!
I'm told she keeps the Vorpal sword hidden in the castle.
The rabbit will help you.
"Find it, Alice."
Take it to the White Queen.
We'll go to the White Queen together.
Why is it you're always too small or too tall?
Colton!
Colton Graham can help us out.
- No!
Fuck that!
- Yes!
No doubt.
"If anyone could clear your names, it's him."
"No, I'm sorry."
That dickweed is not helping us.
Wait a second.
Do you have his contact info?
Not anymore.
"But the wedding is at his family's estate in Hewitt, Texas."
"But you don't want to bother them when they're doing their whole... wedding thing, right?"
"You know, that actually might be our only hope."
Fuck!
How do we get there?
We can't go to the airport.
They're looking for us.
- I'll loan you one of my cars.
- Really?
But first...y'all got to get in the spirit of the party.
"- What do you mean, spirit of--"
- What do you think I mean?
- What about you?
- Me?
I've been in the spirit.
"- Oh, God!"
"- Oh, my God, dude!"
"Oh, my God!"
"- Love your dickdo, Raza."
- Yeah.
"I think you hit it again, sir."

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:
"Ready when you are, Mr. Fowler."
Be right there.
"Oh, sir, if you didn't think I was gonna be in the way,"
I would love to...
No.
Not at all.
Be my guest.
"Oh, thank you very much, sir."
I appreciate that.
"Excuse me, sir."
"I don't wanna appear grabby, but do you think I could have one of these, sir?"
Certainly.
As many as you want.
That's the usual publicity nonsense.
"Ward Fowler this, Ward Fowler that."
Nothing.
"Nothing to you sir, but to my wife..."
"Boy, she's gonna be tickled pink."
(CLEARS THROAT)
But blend it on.
All right.
No.
"I mean blend it, especially on this side."
"Oh, I see."
All right.
Like that?
I can't tell.
"Oh, am I in the way, sir?"
"Oh, forgive me."
You've got to show them...
You have to stick it right up them...
you have to flabbergast them.
- What do I do?
- Put in first gear.
- Where's the handle?
- There.
Put it into second.
"On the left, by your leg."
Press the clutch at the same time.
Your left leg!
- Your left leg!
- Which is that?
The clutch!
- Which?
- Your left leg!
The left pedal!
- Fucking pedal!
"Oh, I'm sorry!"
"Hit me, to check I'm not dreaming!"
Must be that southern wine!
I'd better give it up.
- I can't believe it!
- Good God!
It can't be possible!
- Who's the crazy guy?
- The steel-drum champion!
"Go to it, Jean-Marie!"
Super-dooper!
He plays on Radio Luxembourg.
"- Put it into third, Goubi."
- If I can.
I'm gonna go have a shower.
Ok.
"Uh, Sarah?"
What should I make us for dinner?
"Don't you mean, what should you order in?"
"No, I cook."
S-sometimes I cook.
"Yeah, I'd wait for mom if I were you."
"Wow, look at you."
"Yeah, please don't."
"I look like I walked off the set of ""7th Heaven"" or something."
"I hope you don't mind, I put my clothes in the wash."
And since everything else I own is in Martin's van...
It's totally fine.
What's that?
This is fettuccine bolognese.
Wow.
"Props, dad."
Thanks.
Hello?
Tom?
"Yeah, we're in the kitchen."
Sarah.
"Hey, mom."
"Um, dad said it'd be ok if I came home with him."
"Of course it's ok, if you're here to stay."
"Sarah's here for dinner, which, uh... is actually going to be ready momentarily, so..."
"So, what was it this time?"
"Did you run out of money, or did you have another fight with Martin?"
"Yeah, it was a big mistake."
I really shouldn't have come here.
"Sarah, wait."
No I mean we've hung out a lot but...
nope.
Well if you were telling me you were just going to leave him to the uneducated models in LA then I am going to have to jump his bones.
For both of us.
So are you an actress?
No no not really.
I thought I was for a minute but.
Turns out it's not for me.
Way too much self-analyzing.
So what do you do now?
I design jewelry.
These are mine.
They're very nice.
- Thanks.
Did you hear?
Hear what?
Zaps magazine just named you number one in their Hottest Man Alive issue.
Yes!
Can I...
"Oh, come on are you kidding?"
"I mean come on Cece, it's Zaps magazine."
Yeah.
- It's not exactly...
Wait you're leaving?
Yeah where's Becca?
She's with the producer.
Make sure she gets home OK.
Ok!
Bye... mwa.
Hang on excuse me for one second.
"Hey, Dale..."
Hey Dale.
like some company?
"Yes, I would."
Hi.
"Hi, Andy."
"Hi, boss."
Hi.
Did you hear that?
That was bad.
"That was very, very bad."
Want a date?
I don't think that's going to work.
That's Reverend Whitehead.
God doesn't let him do that.
Got you an ice cream.
Being on the job probably makes you hungry.
Thanks.
What are you doing here?
Looking for you.
Where are you going to sleep tonight?
"In a hotel, if you'll get lost and let me make some money."
I-I don't think you should be doing this.
"What are you, some kind of child missionary?"
Sort of.
I did have an idea about the sleeping thing.
"Hi, Frank."
She spoke to me.
"I speak to her, but she never speaks to me."
"Hey, Frank, going to the dance?"
I-I can't dance.
"Me, neither."
"Aren't you going to introduce us to your friend, Frank?"
"I'm Frank's father's sister, Aunt V, and Frank and I are very, very close, aren't we, Frank?"
- Good.
"Sifu, there's a tailor outside... to make your birthday robe."
- What?
He said he wanted to make a new robe for you.
Ask him in.
BIRTHDAY ROBE TAILOR
I thought you were the tailor Thao.
Thao has gone back to his village.
"Sifu Wong, can I take your measurements?"
OK.
"If you wear what I make for you, you'll look good."
"Why don't you make one for yourself, too?"
"- Front chest, 24 inches."
Strong torso.
- Thank you.
"Arm, three feet."
What sleeve do you want?
Literati style.
"Sleeve width, six inches."
Two feet split.
"Height, five feet."
1.8 for the shoulder.
"Waist, 30."
Do you need a nail to take measurements?
A button was loose.
I was trying to fix it.
"Oh, thank you."
Any time.
Let me measure your neck.
"Collar height, two inches."
- Are you done?
"- If you'd stayed still, I'd have finished."
"Don't worry, Goni."
They'll be leaving soon.
"Mr. Ben-Shmuel,"
I'd like you to come down to the station with me.
Now?
"- Yes, now."
I don't want you to go.
I'll just go for an hour.
"Finish the bookshelf, then go through the house."
He'll stay here to finish.
Sorry for the disturbance.
Alex?
The police came and took Yitzhak.
I don't know.
- Detention center-
Will Daddy come home with us?
"I don't know, Goni."
Is it because of the policemen who came to the house?
- Yes.
What did they find?
- I don't know.
Then why did they take him?
Did he do something wrong?
"No, he didn't."
"Always remember that, Goni."
When will Daddy come home?
"I don't know, Goni."
He said he'd be back in an hour.
They took him to ask questions.
Are they allowed to?
- Yes.
Can we spend Saturday with him?
"Yeah well, let's call it my retirement plan."
You killed Yale.
And Paolo.
You dragged them into this.
Now give me the fucking numbers.
You're outta luck asshole.
I forgot 'em years ago.
Really?
Oh you did?
I don't think so.
"- Papa, please help us."
- Please...
Mama?
You know it's gonna take me a little while to get to Zurich so make yourselves at home.
There's a bottle of Chateau Le Fit in the cellar.
You kids knock yourselves out.
I'll see you at the bank at four.
You remember where that is.
"'Kay, we're not staying here."
And I am not letting you out of my sight.
Get her ready to go.
Hurray.
"No, no."
Please.
- Please.
- Listen.
Listen to me.
Listen.
"You say nothing about this, and your daughter will be home tonight."
Talk to anyone and she's dead.
You understand what I'm saying.
"Look, I"
"Now, wait a minute."
Josephine was abducted from her husband.
Tony was abducted from his wife.
You think these couples represent a happiness he covets?
[Morgan] Or something he lost.
He's a young guy with a deformity.
Major insecurities come with that.
A trauma like that would be devastating for him and anyone in his life.

(Mrs Drayton) I'm always saying the wrong thing.
I'm sorry.
(Jo) Not in the least.
"Dr McKenna, do you -"
"Why don't all of you sort of turn around here, or something."
It's kind of - kind of hard on the neck.
(Mr Drayton) It's in one of our English counties.
It's not what you'd call a farm.
It's more of a small holding.
Here we are.
- 0h.
- lsn't that fascinating?
Yes.
- There we are.
- Uhh.
"- Hey, they look good."
- Surprise.
"0h, they look wonderful."
"Ah, looks like bread."
"- We're not going to eat all that, are we?"
- No.
- (All Laughing) - ls that the way you do it?
"Yes, just break it, just like this."
"It won't break. 0h, no."
"Well, I'm gonna"
- There.
- ls that the way you do it?
- That's quite alright.
That was a tough one.
Does it chew any better than it tears?
- ls it fattening?
- l imagine it must be.
Yeah.
"Yeah, it really is."
No.
Mom...
"Squirt, where the heck's your mom?"
I know I asked you to be my stepdad.
Do you mind being my friend instead?
"So Julie's had enough of the old Bullit, eh?"
We can still play ping-pong together.
Come on.
"You know, I let you win."
"No, you don't."
"Yes, I do."
In your dreams.
You ever see that movie Casablanca?
No.
It goes like this:
"Peanut, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."
"Come on, luck be a lady, luck be a lady."
Oh!
"I can't believe this, I didn't win."
Shocking.
"Well, if it's any consolation, though, this soft serv is outstanding."
Would anyone like seconds?
"Yeah, I would."
"Yeah, me, too."
Thank you.
Sorry things didn't work out with you and Julie.
Hey...
I'm sitting here sharing ice cream with my kid.
It's been a long time since I've done that.
Tell me that's her.
We got in an accident.
"Oh, my God!"
We almost got in an accident.
That seems like a really important distinction.
"There was this big truck, and it barreled through a stop sign, and it missed our car by inches."
"Oh, my God!"
And everyone's okay?
"- Yes, just very shaken up."
- Aw.
"But, Mitchell, I am so sorry that I yelled at you before."
It's fine.
"Look, I brought you the birthday card for mom,"
- and you can sign it.
- Okay.
Thank you.
"- ""To our best friend."""
- Mm.
That's a little sarcastic.
It's her birthday.
- I don't know.
"- No, I mean it."
"Mitchell, I almost died."
I want our mom to have a great birthday.
"Oh, and we're doing this again."
- Okay.
"- Oh, God."
Yeah.
Hi.
"I'll be there in a sec, yeah."
"Okay, my deposition got moved up."
That's great.
So I'll just have to move everything... you know what?
No.
Bring her back!
Bring her back!
No!
Bring her back!
Come on!
Come on.
Come on.
Bring her back!
Test Subject Seven is no longer viable.
(PANTING)
I really thought you were the one.
We'll just...
We'll just have to resume our search.
"Find solace in your faction, Caleb."
We're your family now.
Jeanine wanted me to show you this.
(INHALES)
(GASPING)
"Hey, Four."
Maybe do that thing you do?
(ALL GRUNTING)
PETER:
"Hey, Four, come on, that was pretty good, right?"
"First, I swiped a paralytic from the infirmary."
Then I shot her up when she was all freakin' out about you.
"I mean, I told these guys I was pretty smart."
Guess they shoulda listened.
You're real.
"Yeah, I'm real."
What are you doing here?
"You die, I die."
Is she my daughter?
Of course not.
She is mine and Jørgen's.
What were you thinking?
- Is she my daughter?
- I'll call tomorrow.
- I asked you a question!
- I'll call you tomorrow!
Won't you come to bed?
"- Why did you do it, Jørgen?"
- Do what?
"I didn't know it was him, Helene."
It's just too much of a coincidence.
- He shouldn't have come.
- No.
But we can't control everything in the world.
"Hi, it's 602 again."
Do I have any messages now?
Fine.
Thanks.
- That's nice.
- Let me have a look?
- It's got small swastikas on it.
- They're not swastikas.
It's wonderful.
It's from...
- It's from Allan and Kristina.
- One of our really good lawyers.
"He'll be fired for giving such an ugly vase, right?"
- Put it over there.
- It goes in the basement.
I have to talk to Helene.
I have to pee really badly.
Hot.
- What?
- Hitchcock!
"- Guys, enough!"
- Sarge...
"Yeah, I know!"
"You got to pee, I got it!"
"- No, brake lights!"
"- Oh, crap."
Everyone hang on!
There's no side-impact airbags!
Did you get breakfast?
"I tried, but I got recognized."
Do I know you from somewhere?
Do you watch a lot of pornography?
'Cause I'm in most of it.
"Oh, boy."
What if you were followed?
I don't think it's safe to stay here.
Where are we gonna go?
- The cops?
- Or Figgis!
Do we have any weapons?
I have the pipe we pulled out of me.
I would sooner surrender than go anywhere near your gooey body pipe.
"Oh, no, I'm gonna do it."
- Oh!
- Jake?
Amy...
It's so good to see you.
Thank you guys so much for coming.
"-Cora, how much we pay last guy?"
-Eight dollars.
-And you promised him....
-Eight dollars.
"Room, board and you say you like my wife's cooking."
-Your wife?
"-Oh, sure."
"Tell you what, Nick."
I got to track my guy down in L.A.
"If it don't pan out, I take you up on it."
"Well, okay."
If we still got it.
And I'll send you some money in any case for the breakfast.
"-Oh, yeah."
Do that.
-Okay.
"Thanks a lot, Nick."
"Goodbye, now."
Missus.
Be right with you there.
"Here's a change, 20 cents."
Thank you very much.
"What you need, Mr. Papadakis, is more coverage."
I hadda lass year.
"Last year you had fire, theft, no liability."
So what I need it now for?
"Well, you should've had it then."
Suppose a customer comes in here and there's a spot of grease on the floor?
"No, I'm sorry."
There's no grease onna floor.
"-No, I'm just sayin' suppose."
-No.
- Stop that!
"Hey, what are you doing?"
"- Don't worry Miss Morgan, I'll call the police."
"Don't call the police, this is my husband!"
- He doesn't have a key?
- Don't ask.
"See, I told you I know her better than you."
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
What... what... what is going on?
What are you doing here?
"Well, I..."
I came to see YOU.
Why?
- Why did you come to see me?
- Well...
I...
"In... in... in light of our last conversation, and after speaking with Henry, I..."
I...
I've come to realize... that... alth... alth... alth...
although you might... might have significant reservations about e... e... even considering...
Gregory!
What!
I'm aging here.
What is it you want to say?
"God, you're beautiful."
Thank you.
"Thank you, Gregory."
What?
"I'm so sorry... for the way I acted and for the things I said, I..."
"- I know that I hurt you, and..."
- That's okay.
"You could have it all, my empire of dirt."
I will let you down.
I will make you hurt.
"I wear this crown of shit, upon my liar's chair."
"Full of broken thoughts, i cannot repair."
"Beneath the stain of time, the feeling disappears."
"And you are someone else,"
And I am still right here.
What have i become?
My sweetest friend.
"Everyone i know, goes away in the end."
"You could have it all, my empire of dirt."
I will let you down.
I will make you hurt.
"If i could start again, a million miles away."
I would keep myself.
I would find a way.
-One more try!
-One more try!
"-No, that didnt count!"
Thats...
"-Yeah, really..."
"Oh, we get a light, we got a ...."
Woo!
All right!
Awesome.
This way?
We can go this way...
Polaroid!
.
-Ready?
-OK!
I love vinegar.
"So, your office is in Peel House?"
I've got clients on the fourth floor.
My office is just across the square.
We're on the first floor
- Stanley Brothers.
Pop in some time.
Pauline loves a visitor.
"Right, I shall."
I shall pop!
Please...
Are you Jimmy Baker?
Yeah...
Is your mother in?
"No, she's at her other job."
"Oh, right."
"Well, how are you doing?"
Have you been out playing?
"Singing, I'm in a choir."
"I sing, with a dance band."
We've been on the wireless.
So I've actually sung on the wireless.
"I gave you a rubber ball once, do you remember?"
You would have been about three.
"It was a big, coloured ball."
Have you not still got it?
I had better go in.
Hang on a minute.
I'm off to Canada.
Pastures new...
As they say.
Have you heard that?
"Mandy, I really like you."
That's for making me fall for you.
"Aw, they're in love."
"Ah, my face!"
We got our very own chocolate fountain!
Some of it just went down my underwear.
I like it.
This is the best weekend of my life.
It doesn't even matter that I'm allergic to chocolate.
"Rudy, what?"
"Ugh, stop eating it, then."
"Oh, 'cause I'm allergic to it?"
"Yeah, what happens when you eat it?"
"I don't know, I've never eaten it."
I don't know what...
Rudy!
Rudy!
Just kidding.
"Damn it, Rudy."
It's not that bad.
I just get a rash on my back.
There's my babies.
Why are you covered in chocolate?
Why are you covered in wine?
Don't ask questions.
"Yeah, ditto."
Oh.
I feel like I French-kissed the whole train.
Uh... yum.
"Hey, Mom, did you have a nice birthday at least?"
I did.
"Wait, who told you it was my birthday?"
We will manage any expense.
Please go on and make necessary arrangements.
- Sure.
What's wrong with you?
I know what I'm doing.
The way my son saw me before 10 years
The way he likes to see me.
That's exactly how I'm dressed up.
He will cry out asking if this is what he got his vision back for!
You are jealous.
He won't even be able to identify you.
Shall I stick a mustache?
Mom!
Mom!
- Sir.
Please sit.
It's a hospital.
- Where is my mom?
She will be here.
- Who are you?
Varun!
- Mom!
Where were you?
I have no clue.
What is happening?
Nothing.
You are in a hospital.
You met with an accident.
"Varun, please don't strain."
Be calm.
You were hit by a car while getting back from the restaurant.
How long have I been kept here?
He doesn't get to win.
"Farm-to-table, huh?"
[phone rings] [ring]
- Hey.
- Julia:
How's it going?
"Oh, it's okay."
What's up?
Your parents want to hang on to the kids a little longer.
"I told you, you have to beat them off with a stick."
So I'm thinking an afternoon without the flesh anchors.
Let's do a little day drinking.
I could certainly use one.
Everything okay?
"Oh, fine."
How about that place down by the marina?
Sunday's all day Happy Hour.
I love it.
"Uh, I need to finish up here."
Give me an hour?
I may have to start without you.
It's one of the reasons why I love you.
"Okay, I'll see you soon."
Okay.
Gentlemen.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
"Dr. Barrett, I'm ready to sign the papers."
You have been a terrible drinking buddy.
Why?
You've barely said two words since you got here.
You're so quiet.
I'm sorry.
Get rid of that.
Got some housekeeping to do on the cool wall.
"Anne Robinson said it's silly the TT is this far down, because it's a cool car, it needs moving up."
There.
You're doing that cos she's not here.
Exactly!
I have one - there's an omission off the cool wall.
And it's this.
Which is the Mercedes SL55 AMG.
Mmm.
What a car.
Jeremy's car!
What a car!
There is an issue with this.
It's just been bought by somebody quite famous.
Do you want to guess?
Brad Pitt.
Cameron Diaz.
way.
"Let me help you, Jeremy."
It's Dale Winton.
Dale Winton's a nice chap.
"No, he's orange."
It's uncool.
Sorry.
I'm glad you brought my car up.
I've got one I'd like to share with you.
The least cool car I've seen in a while - 1982 Porsche 911 SC.
Particularly if someone has written on the back and fitted a turbo body kit.
That's my car!
That really is your car!
"And it's hideous, so it's going here."
Yeah.
"Uh, yeah, this is much better than watching Damon visit Cougar Town."
- No offense.
- Don't remind me.
I've always wanted to see this place.
"Yeah, I guess it's a bit much."
Heh.
"Yeah, my entire house could fit in here, like, twice."
I feel like I've been here before.
It's weird.
Do you guys wanna watch a movie or something?
These are great.
That's just a little hobby of mine.
I did the entire Mustang series when I was 9.
- You like cars?
- That's an understatement.
Come with me.
"So the thing about cherries, you have to..."
Mm-mm.
"Oh, my goodness."
That's amazing.
You were quick.
And that would be my cue.
You're giving up already?
"Oh, yeah."
"See you, guys."
"Prepare yourself, my friend."
"Whoa, wait."
How do you have this?
It got passed down through the family.
Why don't you?
I mean...
Promise you'll do it.
Not until you tell me what's going on.
"Okay look, just get out of your apartment."
Turn off your cell phone.
I'll call you at the inn as soon as I can.
Go now.
Okay.
Tell Julia I love her.
Mama?
Right.
Who's Julia?
She's my daughter.
You were married.
Kyra's a friend of mine.
We both wanted a child.
I want you to tell me the truth.
About what?
"You, me, what happened in Berlin."
"I told you, we worked together."
Don't.
"The memories are fading, I can feel them disappearing."
I wanna know the truth while it still matters.
Please.
You were studying in Washington.
I was assigned to recruit you.
You seduced me.
It was part of the job.
Why me?
We knew you could help flip Kozlenko.
Who am I?
What is my name?
Kozlenko.
~ Um...
~ What?
Do you not think she has the right to know her husband was murdered?
No.
No-one has a right to know anything till I know who killed Mr Newcastle.
"We work for the dead, not the living."
Off you go.
Are you sure she can manage it?
She's never done it before.
Only one way to learn.
Are you ready?
"Is this your husband, Mrs Parker?"
"I-I-I mean, yes."
"It's Scott all right, but... just the shell of what he was."
What he used to be.
"(I'm sorry, Scottie.)"
~ All right.
~ Where did you find him?
"I, er..."
I don't have any details.
How did... he do it?
Do what?
Kill himself.
I'm afraid I don't know anything about his death.
"Don't know much for a copper, do you?"
Are you the tea lady?
When did you last see Scott?
Night before last.
Me birthday party.
Happy birthday.
~ Thanks.
~ Was it?
- (HORN BLARES)
I am not having drinks with you.
You might be a pervert.
"I might be a pervert, but you're definitely a car thief."
I said I was sorry.
"- You didn't, actually."
- (SIREN WHOOPS)
- Oh.
- Damn it.
"That's why I said, ""Eyes on the road!"""
Screwdriver. (GRUNTS)
License and registration.
Hi!
"Terribly sorry, officer, but it's actually my car."
I'm trying to teach my girlfriend how to drive stick.
She's got a lot to learn.
I know.
"But, you know..."
Women.
"All right, I hear you."
It's a warning...this time.
Yeah.
Thank you so much.
What are you?
Some sort of misogynist?
You're welcome.
"Go, go, we got lucky."
We?
"- This isn't your car either, is it?"
- Hmm?
I stole a stolen car?
Now how about that drink?
You know it'll be three months until we get a spare part.
Make sure it doesn't happen again.
It won't.
Back to work!
I've got them very cheap.
Take a look at the large one.
- How much?
- 350 FM.
That's for women!
Try it on.
Too small for my girlfriend.
Look at him!
She's looking good.
How much for the trousers?
I'll give you 50 FM.
"No, 150!"
I can't give you more than 50... for that used rag.
I've made some progress with a serious man.
A rich man from Sarakollé.
He just needs to swallow the bait.
This has no future.
"She'll end up getting married, like our sisters."
Watch out!
The Director's coming.
You old whore!
Who did you date yesterday?
"In the afternoon, Seydow."
The ugly one?
Is the Minister in?
I'm Makan's secretary.
Fatou!
The Director wants to see you... tomorrow at 4 pm.
Might be able to pick up his movements.
I've got a croupier to find.
(PANTING)
"You're a hard man to track down, JC."
I need your help with something.
"Get lost, Harry, this is my downtime."
(yells) What the hell are you doing?
Did I not tell you?
I'm your new personal trainer.
- Please!
- Ah-ah!
The tall guy the other night in the casino.
The one that got chucked out.
What's his name?
"- You can't do this, Harry."
- This is just the warm-up.
What's his name?
The one that was screaming for Freddie Lau?
Alright.
Alright.
Stop.
His name's Kevin Grey.
He used to be on the staff.
He got chucked off a couple of months ago.
- Why?
- I don't know.
"It's OK, I've got my badges."
Why?
"Look, all's I know is that..."
is that there was a girl between them.
Some stripper who worked in Soho.
Freddie Lau stole her from Grey and Grey went mental.
What happened to your head?
"Uh, the sky is falling."
Do you have a pair of dress pants or a skirt or something I could borrow?
"Thank you, Lee."
Whatever.
"Hey, you know in that Cat Lady sketch?"
Do I have to hold a real cat?
Cat Lady sketch?
That thing's gonna get cut.
"Oh, good."
Who's that?
That is the new network dude.
"Mmm, yummers."
He reminds me of Scotty on General Hospital.
What?
"No, ew, Jenna."
Do not like that man.
That is a bad man.
"God, you have a gift."
Laura Bush is your size.
"Hi, uh, what are you doing down here?"
I'm known for being hands-on.
Clearly.
"That's how you should dress for work, by the way."
"Yeah, if I was president of the Philippines."
Afghanistan is a different situation...
I'll have an apple juice.
"Oh, we don't have apple juice, sir."
Then I'll take a vodka and tonic.
"Hi, I'm Liz Lemon."
I know who you are.
I thought there was a...
"Please God, don't."
Don't fucking take me out.
Please don't.
Please don't take me out.
-It's okay.
-Please don't.
I'm not feeling that.
What's up with the gallop?
The tempo's shit.
-I'm right.
Right?
"-Yep, tempo's shit."
"No, no, no, no."
Let us get into it.
It's gonna have texture.
"Like, you know, like ooze."
Sonic ooze.
Great.
Sonic ooze.
"Okay, baby, how about a horn section?"
"A little Tijuana Brass, maybe?"
I heard Herb's in town.
-Let's not get patronizing.
-That's not patronizing.
That was accommodating.
I was accommodating you.
"Against my better judgment, even."
"-Sweet, that's it."
That's the direction.
-I've overplayed it.
No.
We just gotta straighten out the beat.
It's not just a game.
Not to me.
I can see that.
"Where were you a week ago, Monday, sir?"
"A week ago, Monday."
"That would be 4, 7, 23, 35, 44, 53."
"Uh, excuse me?"
I was here.
Like always.
Watching a drawing.
Three prime numbers!
I did not see that one coming.
"Do you own a pair of scissors, Mr. O'Dwyer?"
Of course I do.
Who doesn't?
"May I see them, please?"
How about some metallic paint?
Paint?
"Yeah, a shade called titanium black."
Do you think I killed Marissa Kessler?
"Well, you do have her picture up all over the wall."
I've got everybody's picture up on the wall.
"I mean, these are the past lotto girls."
Jackpot winners.
People who work there.
Secretaries.
Gaffers.
They all know me.
I'm a freelance journalist.
I publish a newsletter.
A lotto bulletin.
"Yeah, I've seen that."
- Do you have many rooms?
"- Yeah, we do."
Do you need one?
"- Yes, maybe."
- We have many.
"I'll think about it, and come back later."
Let's go.
I'm going back to Seoul.
You are?
Why?
It's too quiet here.
Don't think I'll be able to write in this lonely place.
Makes sense.
"Okay, let's go together."
"Yeah, let's."
Hwasung Rest Area
- Do you want some coffee?
- Sure.
Over there.
- Hello.
"- Potatoes, large size, please."
"It's 2,400 Won, sir."
Director Kim.
You know I once lost my father in a rest area like this.
You did?
There was this little stream behind a building like this one.
"I was there, but no one knew."
They went crazy searching for me.
My dad really scolded me for that one.
Let's see each other in Seoul.
Don't strain yourself for me.
"No, don't say that."
Brought you something.
- Is it chocolate?
- No.
"Oh, wait... it is chocolate."
How's she doing?
"Couple more hours, and she should be out of the woods."
Mel...
I don't think you should come to Dallas.
I said I was scared.
I didn't say I didn't want to go.
"I know, but..."
You're getting cold feet.
- No my feet are fine...
- Liar.
I think you're going for the wrong reason.
Is this your thing?
Thrill of the chase and then lose interest?
I'm the bad boyfriend you want to make happy.
"- Peter, what the hell?"
- And you don't even know it.
- I'm going to Dallas.
- I don't think you should.
Tough!
"You made your bed, you're gonna sleep in it... with me."
I saw you kissing Jerry.
- That wasn't...
I wasn't kissing...
- Looked like you were.
He was kissing me.
- I actually came up here to see a patient.
- The jackass?
- Don't...
We were playing!
I don't care.
Dad lets us play.
I don't care what your dad does.
This is important.
I want you to look at me.
- So start already.
- Excuse me?
Nothing.
The doctor said I need rest.
And I expect your support.
There'll be some new rules.
I want absolute quiet in the house.
I have to sleep.
"If it's important, knock."
And no visitors.
"If anyone asks,"
Mom is ill.
We'll keep the blinds closed.
I have to avoid sunlight.
"You'll play only in the garden, quietly."
Bring nothing inside.
"No branches, no animals..."
What are you doing?
We'll start over.
Right?
We need to hold this family together.
One from me and one from Lukas.
Very nice.
I'm serious about what I just said.
"We won't forget, right?"
Good.
-Can I turn on the light?
-No.
I put it in here to keep it fresh.
Can we leave this open to get some light?
This is our baby's birthday cake.
I don't want any.
Suit yourself.
It's good.
You should try some.
Today's his birthday?
No.
It was in September.
I missed it.
I left him with Mama before he was two years old.
That means I've missed four birthdays so we celebrated all four of them last night.
Does your mama know about....
Know what?
"No, I never told her."
"I never meant you any trouble, Dale."
I still don't.
Wouldn't Bonnie be surprised to know she had a half-brother in Nigger Town?
You should have some of our baby's cake--
Quit calling him that.
Why?
That's what he is.
"Damn it, I told you I didn't want any."
-Do you want this?
-What are you doing?
-This is what you want.
-Cut it out.
"Cut it out, goddamn it!"
Why did you ever fuck with me?
- Jean-Claude?
- What?
I don't have a hard-on!
So what?
Me neither.
In whose honor should we get it up?
I always wake up with one.
You're probably too filthy...
There's so much dirt id take a bulldozer to dig it out.
Come on.
It feels great...
I can't.
I'll start bleeding again.
"Well, how about your feet?"
We could clean them up a bit.
Purify the air...
You'll be all right...
Stop worrying.
Is all in your head and you're getting obsessed...
"Feels good, huh?"
Feel any lighter?
You're real pretty!
You're almost desirable...
Hands off!
What hands?
"Yours, faggot!"
Don't be ashamed...
I'm not ashamed.
I just don't want to.
I don't want to...
How do you know?
If you've never tried it?
"- I have not been a good person, mama."
"I put everything in my life before you,"
"Before my daughter, before the man that i love..."
My husband.
"Yes, well, we can just put god's will back in our lives."
"I've lost everything, mama..."
Everything.
"But like saul, you can get it back."
"Mom, i just..."
I think it's too late.
- No.
"No, it's never too late."
"- Yes, i don't think..."
"- Yes, it is."
"- You'll see, regina."
It's never too late.
"- I'm right here, mama."
- Oh my god!
- See?
See?
- Oh my baby!
- Oh my baby.
"- I'm so sorry, mama."
"Oh marcus, look at our baby."
Look at you.
"Oh, sweetheart, will you ever forgive me?"
- Please?
"- No, mama, you were forgiven"
The minute i walked in the house.
It's me who you need to forgive
For doing all those things to you.
And then after that we can go swing and go to the park.
Stop calling here or I'm calling the police.
"Oh, my God."
Who was that?
No one.
Noannie.
"It's just some idiots calling saying stupid things, okay?"
Like what?
"Brian, it's stupid."
"Like what, Noannie?"
He says he hears I put out to white boys.
"He calls here again, you give the phone to me."
Do you hear me?
Do you hear me?
Yeah.
"This is all my fault, isn't it?"
No.
"No, don't you ever say that."
"Noannie, look."
"Look, this has nothing to do with you."
Come here.
Come here.
"I know, I know, I slept with my paralyzed boyfriend's best friend."
It's the worst thing I've ever done.
It would be great if you said something.
"Sorry, I'm just thinking how hard that must have been for you to tell me."
And I'm really glad that you did.
I just want us to be honest with each other.
Do you still have feelings for him?
Nope.
No.
No.
Okay.
I knew you fucking looked at me funny.
(sighs)
Liar.
I should have listened to myself.
-Where are you going?
-Nowhere!
Where am I gonna go?
-l'm stuck here with you.
-Yeah.
"And what have you got, huh?"
What have you got outside of this?
Do you have a life?
-How could that possibly matter?
"-What do you mean ""how does it matter""?"
-lt means everything.
-What is...
What have you got?
You've got nothing to live for except for this!
-Mmm-hmm...
-This is all you've got.
You've got your protocol.
You've got your numbers.
You're on the other side of the fucking numbers.
And you read them and you take their money.
"You think you're not a part of this, huh?"
Do you think you can fuck around with these people?
What's wrong with you?
What are you doing here?
You're in it.
You asked for it and you're in it.
"Here, locked and loaded."
-Safety's off. lt's good to go.
You have to see the view.
Join this road.
"Gentlemen, this is our research department."
We are proud of what we gained through research.
"Yes, here is Frederik Jackman and Tonje Sandvik."
Tonje Sandvik our research leader.
Is that you?
Aksel god.
Do you know me again?
-Yes.
Of course.
-Here's Report.
-It's Not necessary.
But it is the latest version.
"We have what we need, thanks."
Shall we proceed?
-Yes.
OK.
"Thus, it is so ..."
It's so disrespectful.
"Yes, it must have been a shock."
Where is Lars?
I need to call him.
"No, wait a minute."
"Eva, listen to me."
PWG is the only card we have.
"In a few days the deal is done, and so you'll never have to see him again."
-What do you mean?
-Drag Back.
Hear what they have to say
He will not getting buy a single share.
-So You'd rather go bankrupt?
'Cause there's a jungle out there
It's a jungle out there
There's something wrong here.
This is wrong.
This is very wrong.
"This is very, very..."
Wrong?
This was no random mugging.
This was all about her.
He was after her.
He took her purse and some jewelry.
He wanted us to think robbery.
She was stabbed six times.
That's right.
Two in the neck.
Four in the back.
"Or, was stabbed three times."
Look at the pattern.
"It's two, two and two."
Three times.
With a pair of scissors.
Yes.
That's possible.
Who brings scissors to a mugging?
Scissors say what?
Spur of the moment.
Not planned.
Plus the mud on her shoes.
There's a mud puddle near the exit.
But there's a light right there.
"If she was walking, she would have seen that."
"So, she was running when she left the building."
- There is something decadent.
- Only in the entire universe ...
It is cool the actors Simon.
You will have you.
- It's great what he says.
I want the book.
- Leave me.
- She has had?
- Who was I?
- Who you had?
- Tu.
I love you.
"You know, I love you."
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
Maybe you should remove trousers if you have the Holy Spirit.
You want to do?
Why?
Why are usually them that they do it to me.
I can also legarti feet.
"For the same reason, usually because ... to me that is doing this."
And this why?
Because usually Am I that are ridiculous.
So we can forget.
The return when I want.
Do not go!
"No, I must follow!"
You need to do evil to survive?
- Even a child?
"- Not a child, it's worse."
How old is he?
I'd say about your age.
My age?
Sit down.
But you don't understand...
Sit down!
I'm telling you all this in confidence.
He's the only hope we have of catching the killer.
The man we're after is after Hoolick.
He's after Hoolick.
"When he strikes, we'll catch him."
But we need someone to keep an eye on Wilbur every minute.
Do you mind if I tell my girl about this?
You're to tell no one.
Wilbur's life is at stake.
It's more at stake than you think.
I knew we could count on you.
We'll keep in touch with you.
Good day.
Good day.
My age?
"Hello, Mr. Miles."
Not now!
(WILBUR WHISTLING)
Wilbur?
"Oh, hello, Uncle Bob."
Did you see those men?
I saw them.
Wilbur.
What?
"When you were on the train, did you spend the whole night in Nancy's drawing room?"
Aunt Nancy's drawing room.
Should I throw in two wreaths and wait for the Père Lachaise to open?
Coming?
Just a sec.
Time enough to waste this jerk first.
- Are you retarded or what?
- He touched Martine.
This rat is jinxed!
Here they come!
"I'm warning you, lying is my speciality."
You're not what's lying.
- What is?
- Poverty!
"If one lies, it's to get... one shouldn't ever get!"
"Here, it's okay."
"Jeez, my clog!"
We can't stay here!
- Do you have money?
- No!
"It's full of memories, this place."
I started when I was thirteen.
I never hurt.
I made supermen out of them.
"Don't worry, my tiptoes are always cold."
The ice queen doesn't want to die.
To sleep... to die... to kill... to make love...
Same battle.
What are you?
- Hatchet man?
Pocket knife?
- Pardon?
Friend of a friend?
Where did Mickey unearth you?
You'll find Mrs. Karras in the last bed on the left-hand side.
"No, no."
"No, no."
Go get someone else.
Don't bother the father.
Go to your bed.
Go to your bed.
"No, no."
"No, no."
The father will be back to see you.
It's all right.
Mama.
"It's Dimmy, Mama."
Dimmy.
"Why you did this to me, Dimmy?"
Why?
"Come on, I'm gonna take you out of here, Mama."
I'm gonna take you home.
"I'll get you out of here tonight, Mama."
"Mama, everything's gonna be all right."
"Mama, I'm gonna take you home."
"Mama, I'm gonna take you home."
-Couldn't you have put her someplace else?
-Like what?
Private hospital?
"Who got the money for that, Dimmy?"
You?
There seems to be an alien pubic hair in my drink.
-I beg your pardon?
-Never seen it before in my life.
Have you?
We're pretty comfortable up there compared to the Gemini and Mercury programs.
I simply don't know what to do!
Yeah.
You good in the garden?
I think so.
Yes.
Yes.
Have you thought about...
Carrots?
Right!
I'll get that recorded.
Thank you.
How's it been anyway?
What the scenario didn't make you feel welcome?
He can't see the point in me.
There's a dog in the script.
"We don't even employ Jack Russel to write woof woof, do we?"
Just been readin' your work.
Umm...them could be better.
We should get some lunch.
I don't accept charm.
It's official business.
I've a proposal for you.
"When I'm not busy special advising, I work for a man called Gabriel Baker."
Remember him?
The Hungarian.
He's a producer.
Desperate to me.
A film that will make a difference.
"Hello, Tom."
Hello.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
I'm going up.
Are you OK on your own while I get you something to wear?
Will you tell Simon I'm here?
Of course.
Got your plastic tits yet?
No.
But I will get some as soon as I'm 18.
"- Hi, Patricia."
- Sofie's here.
She's crying.
She's crying again?
- Sofie.
"Are you OK, baby?"
- I just feel so low.
- Where have you been?
- Sleeping in the park.
- Why didn't you go down to the boat?
- You can't help me.
- Of course I can.
- What's up?
- My mum.
- She'll calm down again.
She's thrown you out.
Tell the bitch I did the right thing.
- It's dead embarrassing for me.
- What the hell is going on?
"Morning, girls."
Is something wrong?
- What's this?
- Check out the centre spread.
"- No, thank you."
- You've got to see it.
Let me think about it.
don't you?
Frabjous Day.
How could I forget?
Wish I'd wake up.
do you?
N-Of course.
This has all come from my own mind.
Which would mean that I'm not real.
Afraid so.NYou're just a figment of my imagination.
I would dream up someoneNwho's half-mad.
yes.
But you would have to beNhalf-mad to dream me up.
(LAUGHS ) then.
I'll miss you when I wake up.
(playing TRUMPET)
Who will step forth to be championNfor the White Queen?
That would be I.
You have very poor evaporating skills.Nl should be the one.
I'll do it.
me.
nohow.
it ain't dead.
you cannot live your lifeNto please others. you will step out alone.
Nothing was ever accomplishedNwith tears.
Absolem?
Why are you upside down?
I've come to the end of this life.
-You're going to die?
N-Transform.
Don't go. I need your help.Nl don't know what to do.
stupid girl.
- That's what I mean.
- We're not a thing.
- We're not married.
"- Oh, no."
You're not married?
- No.
"- No, we're just friends."
- Aren't you pregnant?
"- No, I'm not..."
I'm not pregnant.
"What happens, Martha, if you have a child out of wedlock?"
You'd better do something.
You'd better pop a question today.
"Would you just pull over, Meemaw, and let Martha..."
"- Martha, would you drive?"
"- No, no, no."
We're on vacation.
Your mom's out of town.
She left me in charge for once.
"No, she left me in charge, by the way, Meemaw."
"Wait, where are you going?"
"Um, just making a stop."
"Well, you have an appointment."
"I do, but you know what?"
[Tires squealing]
Chip:
Meemaw.
[Elevator dings]
Christine:
Hello.
[Cell phone rings]
- Hello.
I see a light.
- You're not dying.
It's just your ankle.
"Oh, God!"
- You're supposed to help me!
- Watch where you're going!
- You ran into me!
- Haleh?
Where's the trauma?
"Throw a rock, honey."
Blunt chest in 2.
"You look wonderful, by the way."
- Eighty-five pounds and counting.
- Good for you.
You cut your hair?
"- BP's falling, 70 systolic."
- Keep squeezing that bag.
- Where are we?
- Flail and crepitus.
Needs a tube.
- Who has an angio cath?
- Right here.
How can I help?
"Given there's only one, I don't see how you can."
- What is that?
What are you doing?
- It's a tube to help him breathe.
"He has a collapsed lung, this will re-inflate it."
I need a thoracostomy tray.
"All right, let's see how much air he's got in here."
"Oh, God!"
"That any better, Mr. Chambers?"
Likewise!
"Come on, boy!"
Come on!
Schnapps?
"Well, Sam, here's to your very good health."
- Skoal.
- Prosit.
"You know, that's a lot of money that fellow offered you for your dog."
Yeah?
That's a lot of dog too.
Ja!
"- Hey, boss, let's head for the hotel, huh?"
"- No, no, no, not yet."
Maybe somebody we know will show.
Ole!
Ha-ha!
How are you?
I got lots trouble.
"Nowhere I can get two dogs, cheap."
"What matter, huh?"
I got load of thousand-pound flour...
I got to get over to 40-Mile Creek.
"Two of my dogs, they die."
It's too big load for the other four dogs to pull.
"Quiet, now!"
Yo!
"That's one fine dog, mister!"
"You want to sell, maybe?"
"- No, I don't."
- I'll say he don't!
"You know, that fellow back there... just offered him 1,000 bucks."
- One thousand bucks?
Just put her in the oven!
"OK, a little privacy?"
Take a hike.
"Oh, oui."
"Oh, my gosh, I'm in love!"
You're like a cookie angel.
Wow!
"And you're hot, too!"
Hello?
I guess it didn't work.
Gingy.
Is it you?
The one I was made for?
We'll be together forever.
Sweet!
"Are you happy, Gingy?"
You bet!
The time since I met you has been the best...
seven and a half minutes of my life.
Good!
Because this is only the beginning.
"I'm going to love you and hold you, and feed you and dress you and cling to you and hang onto you and smother you with my love."
- Yeah.
- Forever and ever and ever and ever...
"You know, it's getting a little stuffy in here."
"You know, I'm gonna go get some air."
"- Oh, no, you don't."
"- Oh, no!"
Not without your umbrella.
Come on!
"Here, let me get that."
Wait for me.
Good to know.
- Where's Jackson?
- Change of shift.
"Come back for more, have you, tough guy?"
"Oh, you're looking a whole lot worse than I am."
Whatever.
Where are you going?
Tequila and tacos.
You want?
"Come back inside, we need to talk."
- I'm done talking.
- Let's head inside.
"Ah, shit."
Seriously?
Okay.
I get it.
"Jackson's hatchet, man."
Come on.
"Here I am, do it."
"Go back inside the house,"
"I'll grab my service weapon, tell Jackson I made a move on you."
He doesn't have to know.
"I'll take it from here, Agent Briggs."
Let's take a drive.
She's beautiful.
"I envy you, your emotional responses to things, I..."
I train myself out of it.
But there has been a cost.
"Well, maybe you should stop with the daddy routine."
Let people figure it out themselves.
"You're right, Flynn."
I can't fix you.
"Oh, no, don't."
I'm coming.
Seth Cohen says happy birthday.
Who?
She says thanks.
"Uh, look, I got to go."
Bye.
I got to go meet my friends.
My... other... friends.
"I should get back, too, and protect my cover."
"But wait, listen."
"We have to promise not to tell anyone about this place, okay?"
"Now, Ryan's not going to obviously, and I could get grounded, so that leaves Marissa."
I can keep a secret.
See you tomorrow.
"Me, too."
We'll fix this place up.
Cool.
"I'm telling you, Ryan, this plan is foolproof."
"Hey, Ryan!"
"Hey, Ryan, you ready?"
"Okay, the key here is not to panic."
Do you have your supplies?
"Yeah, but there are cops at your house."
"I mean, do you think it's safe?"
I'll handle Johnny Law unless...are you losing your nerve?
Meet me in the driveway.
He couldn't have gotten far.
We'll search the neighborhood.
Seth.
I was going to get you.
We got to talk about Ryan.
That's not true.
I'm not going to have a child until there's peace in the world.
You just confuse me when you make declarations like that out of the blue.
"OK, I take it back."
I'll put it this way:
"Until the world becomes a peaceful place,"
"I'll be dancing alone, waiting all by myself."
How's that?
"Sounds like something out of a religion called ""dance""."
Good morning.
Thank you.
You're early.
"Yes, yes."
Just a moment.
"Tomoko-san, the phone is for you."
OK.
Excuse me.
"Hello, hello, this is Tomoko."
Yes.
Yes.
Alright.
"I'm sorry, but may I go out for a bit."
"Yes, certainly."
Sorry about this.
Tomoko.
Yes?
"Things are difficult for you, aren't they."
I'm certain about that.
I can tell.
"Yes, there is."
I'll tell you later.
"Pick a good time, but let's talk soon, OK?"
"It's dirty, there's something in the..."
- Jerry.
- What?
What are you doing?
Being forced to work quickly.
"- Normally, I'd be much more charming."
- Take it back!
"It was the biggest mistake I ever made, in my life,"
- not giving that to you.
- Don't... don't...
- Don't do this.
- The situation calls for a grand gesture.
That's all I got.
"I love you, Mel."
"And not being with you, it hurts."
Every day.
"- And it's my fault, I blew it."
- Stop.
"You're right, I should stop."
Jerry this...
- ... isn't going to work.
- It could.
It did.
And then it didn't.
Keep it.
I don't want to throw it away.
OK.
"So, like, hmm, I am..."
"I'm, well..."
"My boyfriend, Luke, hi Luke, he.. he said that he... he wants me to do this, and he told me he doesn't think that I will."
"I, Stacey Ragota, hereby accept the cinnamon challenge."
OK.
He must be someone famous.
Stand back.
I'm going to jump.
"Go ahead, you first."
Rm lumping now.
Go ahead.
I'll wait for my turn.
I'm jumping because nobody loves me.
Nobody loves me either.
I'll get the fireworks going and jump into the garbage can.
How could anyone love someone in this world?
I'm the least loved person in this world.
Me too.
Marjukka doesn't love either of us.
-No.
Let's count to three.
One...
You could've made a good father for me but Mom's too difficult.
Three.
You skipped two.
I'm sorry.
I'll try again.
One...
Two...
I knew you'd chicken out.
There's an ostrich down there.
-What?
Look...
Let's make sure there are no feathers on the scooter.
Then we're out of here.
Do you really think that ostriches would like it here?
It's gotta be around here...
About what?
Maybe we should take him to see a shrink.
"Look, honey."
"If we can just be patient,"
I think we can handle this.
We both love Mikey; right?
We're the ones that are gonna help him out.
Mom.
Mom!
( Gasping ) Mikey.
I was looking for you.
- What are you doing?
- I have something for you.
"Mikey, you have to learn to knock."
They're for being such a great mom.
Why don't you take the flowers downstairs and put them in some water while I get out; okay?
Mom.
Hmm?
"Mom, what if I..."
I'm getting cold.
"If I threw this in the bathtub, it would work just like an electric chair."
You're right.
Be a good boy and unplug it.
( Gunfire on TV )
This is so cool when they blast their way out.
- How do you know?
- I've seen it three times.
"Hi, guys."
How many dead?
"I know how much you miss your cat, so I got you a new one."
"Oh, thank you, Mick."
( Doorbell Ringing )
"Oh, they're a bunch of fucking liars."
The president is a liar.
I think there may be a problem.
Only problem is you motherfucker think I can't hear you!
"Hi, Mr. Freeman."
Unh!
Hey!
"Damn it, watch where you're going, bitch!"
What the fuck is wrong with you?
!
Shit I ought to whup your big ass!
Now get the fuck out of my way!
"- Slow down, granddad!"
"- Granddad, watch out for that curb!"
Ow!
I can't find my seat belt!
"Whoa, hey, granddad, I think we should talk about your eyesight and whether it's safe to drive."
I've been driving my whole life!
I don't need to know how to see to drive!
Shut up!
"Now, what the fuck is this?"
!
I hate when people do that.
I hate it!
I hate it!
I fucking Hate it!
That was supposed to be our space!
You know what?
You know what?
!
Fuck That!
"That's our space, God damn it!"
Can't stand it!
Can't stand it!
Why are they treating this car like it's a hotel?
What's wrong?
Why did you suddenly stop?
It's no fun.
Okay.
I can get out.
What are you doing?
Are you teasing me?
What's the matter?
Did something happen?
Just restrain yourself for another 2 minutes.
We will be arriving at the hotel in 2 minutes.
"Hey, who do you think you are?"
"If I say I can't help it, what will you do?"
Hey?
!
"Even if I am prepared to be understanding,"
"I just can't stand you people, I can't drive you anymore."
I'm not driving!
I quit!
I quit!
Hey!
Drive.
I'm not driving.
I quit.
You!
We originally agreed that I will get 20 000 Won for driving you there.
Just give me 10 000 won.
What?
"I've worked, so you need to at least pay right?"
Hey.
Hey.
Hey!
I can't believe you guys are both here again.
Neither can I.
I can't believe it even more.
"Uh, I thought we agreed Lana was off limits."
"No, I wasn't there for Lana."
"Okay, I care about Noel."
Noah.
His name is Noah.
"It is, right?"
Wait.
Now Noah sounds wrong.
Wait.
"Why are you scolding me, man?"
You were the one bringing her flowers.
They were for norm.
Noel.
Man...
"All right, look, look."
We're both wrong.
"Hitting on Lana is a total violation of several commandments, many edicts, and at least one mores."
Or hang on.
I'm about to blow your mind.
It's only bad if we like the dude.
"Uh-huh, uh-huh, I'm listening."
"Yeah, this guy owes me eight bucks!"
You know what?
He does not return phone calls promptly!
Let me ask you this.
What if he's a racist?
No le dejen mover.
Take off your clothes.
She's clean.
"Viktor Karp, I'm Regan."
Agent Regan of Homeland Security.
ETU.
I'm out.
That's why I'm here.
What happened here?
I had a baby.
The humans took it.
Why you want to see Liana?
I'm her daughter.
Liana doesn't have a daughter.
You're at home.
So I see.
I had you brought here.
We needed you someplace private in case you said something you shouldn't.
"Flynn, you got a drug problem."
No.
- No.
I got an alien problem.
"- Well, you need to deal with it before I let you back on the team."
Team?
Right.
"'Cause we're all just team players, aren't we, Truss?"
You're using me.

Josh needs my help.
Esme's stoned.
- What?
- Yeah.
He wants me to go over and give her a talk.
- Really?
- Mm.
The first thing I got into trouble with as a teenager was smoking weed.
Mmm.
Let me know if there's anything I can do to help.
It's delicious.
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.
I'm glad you called.
"Guess you want me to come down pretty hard, right?"
Yeah.
She'll listen to you...
I hope.
- She's pretty stoned.

Aunt Kate?
What are you doing in my office with your butt in the air?
I was hoping for an injection.
Go to the waiting room.
This isn't an outpatient surgery!
They told me to wait here.
See?
Another example.
"This is an affront to Professor Ciotti,   and shows lack of respect for a person of his stature."
I'll report you to the Academic Senate and have you expelled.
"Cicchirini, calm down!"
And you... get out of here.
Out!
What about my injection?
You expect me to give you an injection?
Get out!
Out!
Motherfuckers...
- Did you do it?
- Me?
No.
Was it you?
"- No, no!"
Maybe it was him.
- I didn't do... it was him.
It wasn't me.
Who is it?
"""Who is it?"" That's for me to say!"
Who is it?
Am I disturbing you?
"No, no, my dear."
Come in.
You're never disturbing.
- I'm...
Shh!
(Whispers) I came to apologise about yesterday.
Is that the only reason you came?
"No, it isn't."
Now I've really lost Bill.
- I am going to the police.
- Please...
That's no good.
No point crying over spilt milk.
You don't understand.
It's not his money I care about.
I really love him.
"So, now I'm getting my own back on that beastly Dennis."
Just a minute.
You said you saw a file on that authoress Flora Ransom?
- Yes.
- Right!
We're going to see her.
I have a few questions to ask that murderous woman.
Excuse me.
- Have a good time.
- I am not going to have a good time!
Is Mrs Ransom in?
She's out but we are expecting her back soon.
Come in.
Thank you.
My name's Bastable.
I'm the lucky fellow she's consented to marry.
"She's a widow, you know."
This way.
"Oh, was Flora expecting you?"
"No way, we have a show coming up tonight."
Do the box again.
"Kids, didn't you hear me?"
We have a show tonight.
"Bye, kids."
All the best.
"Everything will be okay, my sweetie."
Give me a hug.
Barbuda loves you.
"- Bye, kids."
- Bye.
Here.
For you.
Maybe you'll need it someday.
"It's yours now, Maria."
"We promise that whenever the circus is around, or close enough, we'll come visit you, okay?"
"Look out for her, Quico."
"Maria, let me go."
"Be good, sweetie."
"Bye, kids."

Come on and eat Maria.
Do you still like chocolate milk?
Yes.
So...
Didn't you like the nightgown I bought for you?
But it's so pretty.
I've picked your school.
I'll take you to meet the principal.
She wants you to take a test.
But I've always studied!
In the circus?
"- No no no, not yet."
Don't you just love the city at night?
I wish I was one of those insomniacs.
I could live my whole life at night.
"Well, except I'd probably get rickets or something."
- Try a doughnut?
"- No, I'm alright, thanks."
Where is she?
In there.
So what's the story then?
"Just look after her, make sure she's OK."
Help her settle in.
- Be kind.
"- Yeah, good."
Ready?
Brit!
"No, I should check it."
Let me guess: work?
What?
We have finally finally traced the mobile of the victim from the scene where we found your friend's DNA.
Her name's Annie Green.
"For the best bit, it's turned on."
- You saying we track it?
- Already on it.
Alright.
I have to go.
"Momma, my sister, I have to go."
- Go.
- I'll see you later.
- I'll come back.
- Go.

"""Oh, it's horrible."
"Someone wrote in the sky for me. """
I'd kill to find a little note in my diaphragm case.
Oh...
But that's just me.
Then maybe he should be with you.
"No, Joanne."
"Joanne, wait."
Wait.
This is the best party ever.
- Nice speech.
- It was horrible.
I thought it was great.
"Oh, happy people complaining."
"No, they deserve to be yelled at."
I'm Richie.

'Cause I don't think I could handle-
"No, I like it."
"It's, um... jaunty."
Hey.
"Couldn't have looked like crap just a little, huh?"
"- Sorry, it looks like a pigsty."
- Do you spend wisely.
So it is now.

Do you know why we tolerate your kind?
Because I just fit your work.
But you have gone too far.
Now there shall be no rules anymore.
I have not done anything.

Put your pistol away!
What secret?
Get it out!
"Alright, but I have one condition!"
What condition?
I want Yoyo to kiss me once.
Supermac 99!
I order you to kiss her.
"Lucky you, kiddo!"
"In the name of our country, kiss her!"
Go on!

That's why the other secret is even more important!
What other secret?
"I'll tell, but I have to kiss Yoyo this time."
What a pity!
Serves you right!
"Alright, but you have to close your eyes again!"
Sure thing!
My first kiss!
"Don't faint, wake up!"
"Now, what's the secret?"
My father Fat Pig is coming with his troops to get you.
- Fuck!
Watch out for cheetahs!
This is cheetah turf.

"I'm telling you, Jorge... the first thing you have to do when you get to America... buy a device called TiVo, OK?"
Freedom means nothing if you're a slave to regular programming...
I promise you that.
"And now, how about you focus?"
We gotta figure out what to do when we get to the States.
We don't have wallets.
We don't have any ID.
We've got nothing.
"Well, I figure we're gonna land somewhere around Miami, right?"
There's only one guy we know who lives down there.
- Who do we know that--Raza.
- Yeah.
We gotta go see Raza.
- Adiós.
- Hasta luego.
- Adam.
"No, dude, that is Adam."
"Dude, that is Pete."
Can you give us a sec?

Bucky Martin?
Sounds like a stud.
- He actually wasn't.
- Stop it.
"But I knew he could be, if he-- if he just believed."
"And then when I saw Cindy Lee standing alone at the punch bowl,"
Hold it!
"Ah, Mr. MacGyver, we've been expecting you."
You should know your partner here tried to kill us.
Cleeve!
Is this true?
Don't be naive.
Did you really think I'd leave them to follow us or call the police?
Good thinking.
We didn't come alone.
"Oh, come on."
You don't think I'm gonna fall for an old trick like that?
No!
"Yeah, sure, now who's side are you on?"
Yours.
Can we discuss it later?
"He's got a point, MacGyver."
Come on.
Which way?
The plane.
"Oh, MacGyver..."
"Uh, MacGyver."
There's something I've got to tell you.
Later.
Get in.
Um...
The window!
There's no key for the magneto switch.
That was what I was trying to tell you.
I removed it so they couldn't take off with the artifacts.
That's a great idea.
Where is it?
Out there.
What're you doing here in the middle of night
You want to break into my shop?
"I'm sorry, boss, I need 1 0 grams of Tianqi 50 grams of Baiyao, also..."
Are you mad?

Come again tomorrow!
Please help.
It's a matter of life and death
What does it have to do with me!
I need to sleep!
"You can't sleep, boss!"

Think you can sleep no more?
What are you looking at?

Come in!
Hello.
Hello.
What do you think?
Will you let us use it?
It's a little embarrassing.
It'll get you a lot in return if you do let me use it.
My mother says that she can't make it today.
I think you were supposed to go the Kabuki with her.
Has something come up?
My father came back.
I see.
Welcome.
It's been a while.
How are you?
Same as ever.
"Takao, I haven't seen you in ages."
Is your mother well?
Yes.
You should come to Kamakura.
The beach is really popular.
I'd like to get there this summer.
Excuse me.
Someone from the Kokuminsha is here.
"Send him in, please."
Will you be going in the bath later?
"I will, but after we're done talking."
Make yourself at home.
Mother was a friend of hers wasn't she?
"Yes, I think they were very close."
I'm sorry.
l-l don't even like Nikki.
I was trippin' off Kenny.
"You can't help who you love, Derek."
You're not supposed to.
"When you love somebody, you love them."
Look at me.
At least you found somebody who loves you back.
I gotta go.
Where you going ?
"Stay out of my business, Chenille."
I know what Malakai wants you to do.
"Why are you trippin' off him, Derek ?"
All you're trying to do is get the hell up out of here.
Ain't no shame or blame in that.
It's getting cold out here.
Take that baby inside.
Hey.
Hey.
"Kai, I've been trying to catch up with you."
I gotta talk to you.
- Ready to roll ?
- l gotta talk to you.
- Wassup ?
"- Look, man. I ain't going with you."
What you mean you're not going ?
-You know what I mean.
-Did you come here to waste my time?
"This shit is nonsense, Kai."
It's dangerous nonsense.
"Just back up off it, man."
Come on.
- Yeah?
"- Yeah, of course."
- We'll have you guys over.
Maybe I'll make some of my famous apps and we can throw some games in there.
"- That'll be fun, right?"
"- Hey, can you make those baby hot dogs that look like they're taking a nap in pastry?"
"- Oh, pigs in a blanket."
"- Yeah, I guess you could make those, too, if you want, pfft."
All right.

All right.
Bon appétit.
All right.
"Now, is this a chicken or a fish?"
It is a chicken.
"Mm, can't wait."
Okay. [crunches]

What is this?
There are...

Rice Krispies.
It's a Rice Krispie crusted chicken.

I did.
I didn't have any hazelnuts.

- Are you busy with that case?
- Yeah.
"Well, I heard that woman died when you were there."

And you are?
He has come with me.
Take your seat.
Tell me.
The car parked outside...
Is it yours?
Yes.
You have changed the windshield of the car on the 19th.
How did it break?
Why do you want to know about that?
A small enquiry.
Tell me.
Some drunkards pelted stones on it as I'd parked it outside.
So I covered it and parked inside later.
You seem to have changed the glass in a hurry.
Small shards of broken glass pieces are still there.
I can't tell.

"Oh, no, I can't bear to watch one of these again."

I'd better take a look anyway.
Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
"That's why, Sid."
Sure is a hairy fellow.
"No, no, that's Scud, you idiot."
That is Sid.
-You mean that happy child?
-That ain't no happy child.

"87,000?"

Let's enjoy ourselves.
"Oh, thank you very much."
"Oh, Major!"
Major!
"Um, can I have it now?"

- The money.
The money I gave you last night?
What... what is all this about?
You remember I gave you some money just before you went to that remembrance service?
- Remembrance service?
- Yes.
"I don't remember that, old boy."
It was for a chap you didn't like.
"You know, he was..."

One of those what?

- That would be wonderful.
"- Oh, but he's in Germany."
- l'll go and get him...tomorrow.
Tomorrow?

Didn't you feel it?
"No, there's a numb spot on my back."
Strange...
Clean sheets?
I didn't come back to the house ever again.
I haven't seen her or the kids since then.
Thing is I don't exactly remember how that fight begun.
But that's not important.
You've been married and you'll underst...
-Careful!
Hey!
I found a big fridge full of food!
I told you!
Ramón keeps the house ready for everything.

No.
Do you like the house?

What are we going to do?
Nothing.
Goal!
It's your turn now.
Now you.
I did know that Clara would talk about us.
About our relationship.
About how was everything.
But I didn't expect what she said.
Did she talk about me?
You weren't the point.
-The point was you two.
"Yeah, us..."
"Okay, Jenny a-and I, we're looking to have a new nanny."
"Or in Tyler's case, a... a manny."

- What?
- Yeah.
[Both chuckle]
Stop it.

Who is this guy?
He's Lanie's new boyfriend.
She wanted me to check him out but not to tell you.
"You know what this means, right?"
We... are gonna have some fun at Lanie's expense.
"Hey, Lanie."
I got your text.
And I've got your murder weapon...
"A picture of it, anyway."
I used the autopsies of The Phantom's victims to generate this.

Hmm.
Those serrations near the base are pretty distinctive.
Exactly.
Find the knife...
Find the killer.
Nice work.
"So, how's the background check going?"
"Oh, pretty good so far."
I don't like the sound of that.
"No, t-there's..."
there's nothing to worry about... y-yet.
It's... it's just a rumor.
Let's hear it.
"Well, it's going to better use there."
What use?
Do you know what they're using that money for?
"They're feeding refugees, building houses."
You guys don't help anyone!
We help you.
"W-we help you, and we helped you save that money."
Please do not roll your eyes at me.
You can show me some respect.
"Paige, you started lying to us..."
I didn't lie.
"Well, you certainly don't seem to know the difference."
Do you?

"We go, Lella, only a little."
-No.

As a neighbour?
You'll be just like your dad.
"Shut up, shut up, shut up."
"- That's what really scares you, isn't it?"
- Stop it.
- Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
- You're going the same place he did.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
- You're going nowhere.
- Shut up!
Shut up.
Youshouldhavecalledmum.
She's all that's left.
- You abandoned her.
"- No, no, no, no!"
Get out of my head!
You'll never see her again.
You'll never speak to her again.
- Never see her face.
- Get out of my fucking head!
Get out of my fucking head!
Get out of my fucking head!
You're a bad son.
You'll never see your mother again.
You're going nowhere.
Straight into oblivion.
You deserve it.
You should have called her.
Get out of my fucking head!
Hadn't you better catch him up?
You don't want him taking the hump again.
"Oh, lord, he could be anywhere."
I'll see you at Popmobility.
Thanks for everything!
Bye!
Bye.
"You'll have to take the lift, love."
"Oh, flip."
It's all right.
You don't have to fling me into the gutter by the seat of my trousers.
It's not the Beano.
"Quick as you can, boys."
Up over there!
Who is it?
Sir!
"It's Jimmy Baker, he's up on that ledge."
Everyone shush!
"He's too late, though, isn't he, sir?"
"Because he didn't come on the tram, sir."
"Climb over, jump down, I'll catch you!"
Look lively.
Is everything all right over there?
Get in your place!
"Yes, thank you, Sir Hamilton."
Baker was just helping me up.
"Lost a leg, sniper, Vimy Ridge."
Good man.
I was Naval Reserve.
North Sea.
Lot to be grateful for.
You said Baker hadn't turned up.
It was just a question of time.
"Shall we go, son?"
Now?
You wouldn't want to worry Mama.
"No, I wouldn't."
Take good care of him.
"Oh, he'll be taken care of."
I don't want to go.
"Why, Wilbur?"
"Yes, tell her why."
"Well, because, you see, I'm not really a little..."
I like it here.
I want to go to school here.
This is a girls' school.
That's why I like it here.
"Now, Wilbur, you mustn't hurt your father's feelings."
"You wouldn't do that, would you, Wilbur?"
No.
You know how sensitive I am.
He's very sensitive.
"You're choking him, Mr. Hoolick."
Oh.
(COUGHS)
"Come along, son."
You don't have much time.
"It's been nice meeting you, Mr. Hoolick."
"It's been very nice meeting you, Mrs. Brendan."
"Goodbye, Wilbur."
"Don't say that, Mrs. Brendan!"
"All right, you."
Where is it?
Why did you tell Mrs. Brendan you're my father?
It's an Audi.
Give me that.
How fast does it go?
"I don't know. 140, I think."
What fish are they?
They're meant to be sharks.
But I think they're sort of catfish.
Do they cost a lot?
"Yeah, they cost $100 billion."
"""Smoking kills."""
"Thank you for that, cheers."
I'd forgotten.
"You know, Will, you've got a nice flat."
Thank you.
"Only one bedroom, though."
Largely because I find I can only sleep in one bed at a time.
You could get a bigger place.
"I mean, if you needed to."
"Would you like anything to drink, Marcus?"
"Thanks, just got a Pepsi."
Who are these people with the saxophones and trumpets?
Saxophonists and trumpeters.
Why have you got pictures of them?
'Cause they're cool.
What's cool about them?
I don't know.
They took drugs and died.
A vowel.
"""A."""
- And a final consonant.
- And a consonant.
Thank you.
- Do me a favor.
"Finish this beer upstairs in my office, quick."
Huh?
Higgins is here.
It's after 6:30.
"If he catches you in here without a jacket, he's gonna string me up alive."
"No, he won't."
What?
"I can guarantee ya, five gets you 50, he's gonna lay that old line on me that he's on the board of directors."
He's gonna tell me to throw your butt out of here.
Money's up.
[ Sighs ]
You're on.
"Hi, Hig."
And how is your investigation progressing?
"Oh, not too well."
- Are you sure there's nothing more I can do to help?
- [ Rick ] To help?
No.
Positive.
"Well, if there is anything, please don't hesitate to ask."
- Put Magnum's beer on my tab.
- I always do.
- Tomorrow at 3:00?
- I'll try.
Thank you.
You believe that?
"You're catching flies, guys."
Give that guy a drink.
?
[ Lounge Piano ]
?
Oh.
Marissa?
Look who's here.
Luke!
Hi.
Hey.
Mm.
Just grabbing a little grub before we take the boat out.
Boat?
"Yeah, I thought we'd take my dad's DawnSea."
"Do a little water skiing, have a little lunch."
So you have no idea where Ryan might've gone?
I don't know.
He did say something about going down to Mexico and gambling on cockfights.
"I mean, I don't know what kind of jurisdiction you guys..."
Quit joking around.
Will you answer his question?
"Yes, I did."
I really don't know.
I do not know the guy.
I never got the chance.
"Hey, there's eggs."
"Oh, I'm taking Caitlin to the stable, so I need to get that check."
Does Caitlin really need a pony?
"In a couple of months, she's not even going to like horses."
What?
!
I love China.
She's the prettiest pony.
We're not giving up China.
"Now go wait in the car, sweetie."
Mommy will be right with you.
I don't care as long as she's lucky.
Is it too much?
You look great.
Excuse me.
"New girl, new girl."
You're off your mark.
My mark?
Yeah.
"The big ""X"" on the floor."
Look where I'm pointing.
Oh.
90 seconds!
90 seconds?
Wait.
"No, no, no."
I don't have a script.
Excuse me.
I never got a script.
There is no script.
This is the lottery.
"For the love of God, if there was a script, we'd all be rich."
God.
Amateurs.
Captain.
Lieutenant.
How is the investigation going?
"Well, we're just getting started."
"Spoke to the staff, the camera crew, everybody said they left the building after the show."
They usually do.
"Well, somebody was here."
The girl didn't stab herself.
You wanted to know if Marissa received any fan mail.
""" Love is a virus... that infiltrates itself... in the system of two lovers."
"Yours, Gary"""
"He didn't sign off""love,"" but there are two ""loves"" before."
"It's good, no?"
Remember me?
Of course.
My public defender.
"- Beautiful, isn't it?"
- What?
Far out.
Can I try it?
Far out.
I need to tell you that I love you
I could win or lose you
But I need to tell you that I love you
Beautiful.
You have mine.
I have yours.
Miami I can get you for $7 50.
It has to be New York.
Can I just buy a one-way ticket?
There's a flight with stopover in Paraguay for $650.
$650...
It's still a little high.
"No, thanks."
You can't get a hotel in New York for less than $7 0 a day.
I'm staying with my boyfriend.
- He has a loft in Soho.
- Can't he lend you some money?
"No, he doesn't know me yet."
Your boyfriend doesn't know you?
No.
It looks like there's some tidy minge here.
"Yes, it's tidy because there's no hair on it."
"Oi, Si, Hannah Fields is over there."
It's her who write your Valentine?
"Oh, yeah, shit."
She looks quite fit actually.
"Right, I'll go over and tell her you fancy her."
- No.
- Why?
"Well, you going over and telling her I fancy her, seems a bit, y'know, childish."
When in Rome.
That's how you got to play it with younger girls.
You go over...
"Shit, she's coming over here."
So did you get my valentine's card then?
"Oh, yeah, great."
Thank you.
- Do you want a drink?
- I've got one thanks.
"No, I mean a proper drink."
Oh... right.
"Yeah, thanks."
You're fit.
- Sorry?
"- Oh, forget it."
Come on.
"You're well sexy, I used to stare at you in assembly."
Right.
"Ooh, you're so horny."
Tongue me!
"Um, how old are you?"
"Blimey, that didn't take long."
"I don't think you are, Dad."
"You know who's in there, right, besides the little girl?"
Her mother and her father--Charlie.
That means he knows.
And that's two people with a lot of information that have had some pretty bad experiences with us over the years.
They have to go.
"Dr Penzler, too."
I can't risk a leak.
It's too important.
They don't matter anymore.
It's all about Allie.
"You're not in charge here, Mary."
I am.
Take a step back.
Calm down.
I'm sorry.
You're right.
"Just, the two of them having gotten together has made me a little nervous."
- They could really gum us up.
"- No one's getting killed here, Mary."
Of course not.
CYNTHIA:
I got to go to the bathroom.
Grab a cup.
Knock yourself out.
"Lisa, hows he doing?"
He's still breathing.
Are you all right?
I just don't want any more bad news.
Mr Watson?
"Luke, when he died, he wasn't mad at you anymore."
DALE:
Or you're just acting blind to the truth that we're husband and wife!
And the way to Bela is the only thing I remember.
Can't you understand that?
"I don't want to understand it because I'm so tired of you, Migs."
"Well, I'm tired too."
I can't take it anymore.
One more chance?
I will change.
"If I would keep you hoping, you'll get hurt even more."
"Migs, I need you."
I'm begging you.
-I'm here for you now.
-What are you doing here?
.
This is wrong.
-Wrong!
-Wrong?
.
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
My heart and mind says you're the one I love.
You're the one my heart is screaming out.
"But what if, what if your memory comes back?"
How?
What if the accident really happened so I can come back to you?
.
I don't want to get hurt again.
Don't be scared.
Don't be scared.
What did she say?
.
"Hello, this is Joy."
You named your battleship after your assistant?
Yep.
"They're both cold, heartless war machines."
"Your tea, sir."
"Look, I am truly sorry for the mess I caused."
Let me make it up to you.
Take Zhu Li.
"My battleship, it's yours, and everything on it."
"It's not the fleet we were looking for, but it's the next best thing."
All right!
Team Avatar is back in business!
It's okay.
We're gonna stop Unalaq and get Jinora back.
I hope my dad's all right.
I'm sure he's fine.
Get the men and fall back.
What about you?
I'm going to end this right now.
Go!
"Hello, Tonraq."
Looking for me?
"Brother, I'm too strong for you."
You're no brother of mine.
You betrayed me.
You had me banished.
"Yes, I did."
Stop!
He's mine.
You are not the true chief.
I am.
And you will bow to me.
"Now that I've defeated you, your daughter is next."
The war is like a time bomb for everyone who stuck their neck out.
How did you recognize me?
You said my name right away.
Your voice.
It hasn't changed.
"Like in the past, when you'd brief us before we'd go."
I'll visit again soon.
Maybe with good news.
"Whatever you'll do, good luck."
"The children would say ""Mazzel and broche""."
Ok.
Thanks.
More chicken and we're also out of orange juice.
"Ab, come on."
-Orange juice.
I like to have a full fridge.
In case something happens.
What happens?
-Anything.
War.
-You and your war.
There.
-Thank you.
Juice.
And juice.
I called you at the office earlier.
-I wasn't there.
And you weren't there yesterday or the day before yesterday.
That's true.
I was away for work.
-But they didn't know where you were.
Jealous?
"Hello sis, how are you?"
"I'll go to your house later, okay?"
.
"Sis, are you okay?"
.
They really are close to each other.
Who?
Migs and Bela.
I'm not used to seeing them like that.
"Sis, be strong."
Fight for Migs.
"You know, show Migs why he fell in love with you."
I just find it so hard every time he sees me but he doesn't remember me.
But I can't make it obvious.
I have to hide it.
-It hurts so bad.
"-Sis, you can do that."
I have to carry on.
I'll show him why he loved me.
Take a bath.
"You know, this is where we had our second date."
And you always take something home for Raya and Mrs. Robles.
That's why Raya loves you so much because you always bring her food.
-It's because you keep bribing her.
-Is that so?
.
-Who were you talking to?
-It's Ara.
Later...
"I'll go to our house, I'll just get something."
-Do you want me to go with you?
.
Ahem.
"Okay, you're not helping, really, with my nerves here, so I gotta go."
Goddamn it.
"Hi, I'm Lucy Miller."
Um...
You must be Maggie.
I'll be representing you.
"I brought warm, comforting beverages."
Or what's left of them.
The rest is on my new white shirt that I wore to impress you.
"Uh, can we sit?"
Great.
Oh.
Sorry about your chips.
Um...
"Look, uh, yours is not a hopeless case."
Seems pretty hopeless to me.
Hm.
I can see that.
I'm not saying it's going to be easy.
They do have your son's voice on the 911 call.
I don't even know what happened to me.
I didn't mean to scare him.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
"You know, um, I'm scared too."
You're scared?
This is my first day in the field.
That's comforting.
I volunteered.
I specifically wanted your case.
A charity case.
Because I think I can help you.
A clown ba...
It's like a baby...
It's like a clown that is a baby.
- I said cl... clown baby.
- Mm-mmm.
You said baby clown.
- I don't even care.
- Yep.
"""Clown Baby""?"
What in the hell kind of a name is Clown Baby?
"Bro, it's perfect."
Nobody's gonna bet on a guy named Clown Baby.
He's gonna be a huge underdog.
- Which means we stand to make even more money off him.
- Exactly.
"- Oh, that's brilliant."
"- Hey, pal, 500 bucks on Clown Baby."
"Oh, Dennis. 500?"
"That's all we got, dude."
You saw Charlie.
We turned that kid into an animal.
"Oh, yeah?"
Call me a Holocaust victim?
Say you're prettier than me?
"Okay, maybe that part might be a little bit true."
We'll see how pretty you are as soon as I punch a hole in your...
Wha...
Where the he...
Who took my shit?
I might have had some.
"What did you just say, you little bitch?"
I might have had some of your pills or whatever.
"We're on an island, all alone."
"Look, we appreciate the imagery and all that, but this is no time for existential metaphors."
No.
Really.
The pier's been washed out.
"Summer, you're okay !"
I am so glad to see you.
"Hey, where's Ryan ?"
He's...
Hey.
"Hey, Atwood."
I got to look for Pancakes.
"Oh, my God !"
Pancakes !
I'm gonna go with you.
Great.
"While you guys do that, Ryan and I will, uh..."
Go.
"Yeah, we're gonna go."
Where are you gonna go ?
"Yeah, we just got here."
"Well, we need supplies."
I have supplies.
"No, I know, but, uh, who knows how long those will last."
"Yeah, and there'll probably be a run, especially when the zombies come out."
Seth.
Ryan.
"Look, guys, we'll be fine."
"Just stay here, lock the doors and don't open them."
"Summer,"
Pancakes needs you right now.
Be careful.
I just wanna walk.
How is he?
"Well, he's doing pretty good, considering."
Do you think she ever really loved him?
It doesn't look like that matters.
"- Breathe, Harriet, breathe."
- I am breathing.
We need to come up with a better game plan for that next contraction.
You're doing just fine.
- Let's just have a look at you.
- Okay.
You're going to feel a little pressure.
A little pressure might be a nice change.
Where's Dr. Gettis?
He was due in here 10 minutes ago.
- I don't know.
I paged him.
- Get him in here.
- What is it?
- I need you to roll over on your side.
- I need Dr. Gettis right away.
- Okay.
Get that pillow down.
Yes.
- Don't push yet.
- What's happened?
Just something the doctor needs to look at.
They can't find him.
I've got Dr. Chadway.
"Doctor, we have a prolapsed cord."
The baby's heart rate is showing decels.
"Yes, sir."
Wow!
Add one goldfish.
"Oh, no!"
"For him, time has stopped."
Is it dead?
No.
Watch carefully.
"Now, he's in the future."
He leapt through the time he was frozen.
"No, that's not right."
"On TV, time machines go zoom..."
"Yeah, up and back between past and present."
Correct.
And that's what I'm studying.
"Follow me, please."
I'll show you an amazing trick.
I'm going to make this Pikachu disappear.
Wow!
What did you do?
It's gone.
We created a mini black hole ...at the micro level.
It's called a worm home.
Where'd the paper go?
"First, it became incredibly small."
"Then, crossed dimensions, ...and came out of another hole."
Where's the other worm hole?
Wanna see it?
What if he kidnaps us?
You've got your cell phone.
No service.
Isn't he a weirdo?
That's only what my Dad said.
-I have an appointment!
What is happening?
Go and look.
"Maestro, I have something special and he won't let me come in."
-You cannot pass!
-Go away outside.
I have something truly exceptional.
"See, show the maestro."
Show it to the maestro.
-What is going on?
-Can't you see?
I only see a cheeky one.
"-In other words, two of those."
-Look at it maestro.
"Well, look at it."
Is it not a loveliness?
Show it.
Show it to the maestro.
-Congratulations!
- What did I say to him?
Doesn't she at least deserve a test?
"Yes, I don't know."
Perhaps.
At least it deserves the proof of the currency.
Show me how you move.
Pick it up.
Is it like this?
Or is it so?
Well you have a future.
"So says someone, who knows."
-Thank you maestro.
-Then you make her a star?
What are you doin' here?
You're gonna miss your race.
Don't worry.
"I'll give you a police escort, and we'll make up time."
"Thank you, Sheriff."
But you know I can't go just yet.
"Well, why not?"
I'm not sure these tires can get me to California.
- Peet stop?
"Yeah, does anybody know what time Luigi's opens?"
I can't-a believe it!
Four new tires!
I can't-a believe it!
Four new tires!
"Grazie, Mr. Lightning."
Grazie!
- Would you look at that!
- Our first customer in years!
"I am filled with tears of ecstasy, for this is the most glorious day of my life!"
"All right, Luigi, give me the best set of blackwalls you've got."
No!
"No, no, no."
You don't-a know what you want.
Luigi know what you want.
Blackwall tires.
They blend into the pavement.
But-a this...
Whitewall tires!
"They say, ""Look at me!"
Here I am!
"Love me. """
"All right, you're the expert."
She thinks she's doing her job.
I am going to pull him from her class.
Don't overreact.
The agency said there was gonna be emotional scarring.
"Hey, give it back!"
How could you like to be his parents?
Where are my baby fish?
Mr. Michaelson bought them for his aquarium.
They were mine!
They were grown up.
It was time for them to have their own home.
You had no right to sell them!
"- Mikey, what's wrong with you?"
- They were mine!
Calm down.
They were only fish.
You don't care about how I feel.
You don't love me.
I hate you
Calm down.
Stop it.
"When Daddy gets home, we'll talk about it."
He's not my real daddy.
You're not my real mother!
I hate you!
I wish I never met you!
"Mikey, wait!"
( Door Slamming )
I'm sure there's an explanation.
If we could just get him to talk.
I don't know.
Maybe they're right.
I owe a lot of money.
I can't pay him.
Pay who?
A loan shark.
Why?
Because I wanted to get my family out of here.
I didn't want my daughters in this town anymore.
You borrowed money for your daughters?
Stop...
What's wrong with you?
What is it?
What's wrong?
Two months ago I found a brick.
At the Point.
A brick of what?
Tobacco?
Heroin.
You know what that is?
How much did it weigh?
One kilo.
What did you do with it?
I sold it.
What did you do with the money?
I spent it.
On what?
The car outside.
Do you think that's why they killed your daughters?
I don't know.
They came here for their money.
"They took the washing machine, the fridge, the television..."
"If I don't pay, they'll take the car and the boat."
We'll have to move away.
Plus he's scared shitless of me.
We pay four large.
Cost of business.
Take it out of his payroll.
"And it's only his first dealing rap, so worst case scenario?"
"They plead him out, he does five months picking up litter in an orange jumpsuit."
So who goes inside?
I don't need them seeing my face.
"Well, I don't need them seeing my face."
Why not?
You look like his typical clientele.
Dick.
Fine.
We'll flip for it.
Call it.
Heads.
Mayhew?
Mr. Mayhew?
Mr. Mayhew.
Nice of you to come down.
Please.
Look at you.
Should I call the FBI and tell them I found DB Cooper?
Joking.
"Please, come on."
Come on.
Please.
Hello.
Saul Goodman.
Please sit.
So it's a shame that we have to meet under these circumstances.
I believe you have something for me?
You were the last one to see him.
Did you give him the suicide weapon?
-Me?
To commit suicide?
I'm from the insurance.
-That clears you.
Our company doesn't provide this service yet.
Excuse me.
Give me.
What was wrong with him?
Was he an alcoholic?
"No, acute leukaemia."
He only had a few weeks to live.
He was very scared.
Scared to tell his wife and afraid of total decay.
He couldn't handle the final weeks.
That's why.
Bang.
"This isn't possible, guys."
If only it had been a few days later.
Now we've been liberated.
Dorien.
Did I age that much?
-Ab!
I recognized you right away.
You didn't change a bit.
What a surprise.
Come in.
Were you working in the garden?
"-Yes, shall we sit there?"
I just made tea.
-Alright.
"If anyone asks, say we're looking for treasure."
Imagine I ask you:
"- ""What are they here for?"""
- Treasure.
It could mean trouble.
Not at all.
What a beautiful village!
"Yes, it's very beautiful."
You've hidden it well.
We haven't hidden it!
The ancestors built it here.
It was them then!
They built it like this so no one would steal it.
"Tell me, why do you think they built it here?"
Because I wasn't there.
You weren't here before then?
Did you arrive recently?
I think the car has a problem.
It's stalling.
It struggles on hills.
The gauge isn't working.
"Yes, it has a problem."
"Farzad, get out."
- ls there water here?
"- Yes, over there."
"Get out, guys, and check the car."
Try to find out what's wrong.
Has your car broken down?
Our car?
It's given up the ghost.
Meaning?
It can't go on.
I slipped on banana peel in alley way comin' back.
Let's go see about those dresses.
How are you girls holding up?
Fine.
Fine.
We're out of bullets again tho.
Why don't you use one of those guy's guns?
They seem to have plenty.
Why the hell didn't I think of that?
These guys got everything Daze!
Even a little Glock for your purse.
You know the blue one?
It's like Christmas!
I got you...
Sucker!
Take your pick mister.
Why don't you decide?
"Okay, let's see..."
"I'm gonna go with the .38, Daze."
"Alright, are you ready mister?"
Sure.
Okay.
Here goes nothin'.
Hardy har har.
What?
Are you done yet?
Come again?
"I said ""Are you done yet?"""
What are you talking about?
"You weren't serious you're gonna do it, were you?"
I most certainly was.
With that piece?
I think I can stand that.
[Greta snarling]
DAVE:
Scrub right here.
[Shower running]
[Monique gasps]
What the?
Oh well.
"Hey, this isn't so bad."
[Monique giggling]
"Dave, what's that?"
[Doorbell ringing]
I'd better see who it is.
I'm gonna check the breaker box.
The breaker switch jumped off for some reason.
"Hey, who was at the door?"
MONIQUE:
"Whoever it was, they left."
"OK, Richard."
"Stand there by the front, over there"
A little closer to the center.
That's about right.
"OK, now, I'm gonna kick the car out of gear."
"OK, you got it."
Can you hold it?
Yeah.
"Yeah, I can hold it."
I'm not gonna push it far off hill though.
"Well, uh, tell you what, now."
What I want to do is to kind of ease up on it a little bit.
"Like, you know, let it... as if you"
Were gonna let it roll forward and pick up a little momentum.
"I'm sorry, Mr Devereaux, but we get a lot of cars here and it's hard to keep track..."
- You mean the car is here now?
"- Oh, yeah."
It's right outside.
"They stole it right offthe street from you, huh?"
Goddamn.
"You're gonna have to pay the towing charge, you know."
"I was told these things happen in New York, but one never expects it."
"Yeah, well, that's New York."
Is this your first trip over here?
Yes.
"Where's my car, please?"
It's right over here.
You're lucky this time.
It's in perfect shape.
Not a scratch.
You must lead a charming life.
Henri.
Je vous attendais.
Let's go!
I wouldn't be surprised if I'd been followed.
"- Listen, I'll see you at Pop's tonight."
"- OK, babe."
Take care.
They got the bridge blocked off!
This is the police.
You're surrounded.
Come out with your hands up!
This is the police.
You're surrounded.
Give 'em the gas!
Hold your fire!
"Yes, Miss First Lady."
It's in my pocket next to my heart.
"You know, Mary Todd gave it to Lincoln to remind him he only had so much time to do good things while he was in that chair."
- I hear you.
"Well, kiss Amber for me, okay?"
I love you ladies.
Miss you.
- I gotta go back to being president.
- I love you too.
Did you know that 1.5 million people visit the White House every year?
"No, I did not know that."
"Look, I'm sorry."
I'm sorry that I didn't make it to your talent show.
I'm not.
Seriously.
Did you know the White House used to be called the Presidential Palace?
"Look, I need you to hear me right now."
Look at me.
I really wished I was there.
"No, you don't."
All I-
- All I did was twirl a flag.
It was stupid.
"You know that you don't have to do that with me, right?"
- What?
- Have thick skin.
You're 11.
- Good morning.
"- Good morning, sir."
- How are you?
"- Fine, thank you."
Yourself?
New York City.
"Relatives, you know."
Yeah.
"Well, you have a good time, anyway."
- Yes.
Is that my cheque?
- That is your cheque.
- Good.
"- Thanks, Saul."
- Shalom.
- Have a good time.
- I wonder how long he's been planning that.
- I don't know.
You heard him.
"Lena's been planning, he's been postponing."
"Hey, my new tux is in here."
He didn't even mention it. it's not on the bill either.
She must've really been anxious to get on that vacation.
I'm goin' that way.
"Come with me, pay him and we'll say goodbye to Lena."
"OK, that's a good idea."
- Here.
This'll keep you honest.
- Mac.
Will they keep the shop open while they're on vacation?
They might have someone part time to take orders.
Out of business?
"Hey, brahda."
Bet you'd like a ride to Diamond Head.
Ten bucks round trip.
Ten bucks?
"No, thanks."
I bet you anything he's well hung.
How do you know?
Did you see him?
You want a cookie?
Of course not.
You can tell from a guy's face.
And especially from his crotch.
I've got a sixth sense.
"He's friendly with Benigno, isn't he?"
Yes.
"He isn't a faggot too, is he?"
No way.
Are you nuts?
Are you insinuating Benigno's a faggot?
I'm not.
"It's vox populi, honey."
You're very wrong.
Dr. Vega confirmed it for me.
How would he know?
Alicia's father told him.
"I don't approve of him being so intimate with the patient, but Dr. Vega told me not to worry."
"Benigno doesn't like women, he's into men."
My God!
I'll leave so you can carry on pulling him to bits.
The poor thing likes Benigno.
"Good choice, sweetie."
Hey.
"Hey, Benigno."
I'm free tonight.
I'm going to the Cinematheque.
Want to come?
I'm meeting my editor.
What can I do then?
I got an idea.
What is it?
I can guarantee success with my idea.
- Your Highness will have to be patient.
- Why?
"If you can be patient,"
I'll guarantee you'll have the books of Chin Kang Fist and 8-divine Sword.
Brother!
What is it?
Fung-wu killed his master!
He killed his master?
How can it be?
How can it be?
It's true!
Fung-wu's master was playing chess with His Highness.
"Suddenly, he held a sword in his hand and plunged it into his master's body."
That's unreasonable.
How can it be?
I saw it myself.
His master told him before he died that he'd done the right thing.
Done the right thing?
That's strange.
What happened afterwards?
His Highness arrested him for murder.
Did he resist?
It was useless!
He's helpless!
"Yan-ling, don't be sad!"
I'll find out the truth.
"1, 2, 3!"
"1, 2, 3!"
And I am not apologizing.
My past isn't about you.
"-Oh, that is cold."
"-No, it's not."
It's clear.
"You're gonna keep me in my place, are you?"
I'm not gonna keep you anywhere.
You are free to move around.
"Well, I'm not moving, for your information."
"You can work your tough-girl thing, but I know you're in love with me."
That's irrelevant.
"Kind of tired, babe."
You know?
-You're up early.
"-I know, and I'm not happy about it."
-You need some Valium?
-I don't wanna get back into that again.
"Yeah, that wouldn't be good."
Try swimming.
It helps.
-So how are you?
How's work going?
-Good.
-Just not sleeping enough myself.
"-Oh, I'm sure."
-Hospital's been busy.
"-A lot of psychos, huh?"
"No, just a lot of pained souls."
"Listen, I appreciate your interest in Alex."
I meant to tell you that.
I really like Alex.
I like her a lot.
"Oh, mate."
That'll be a little surprise package I've arranged for us this evening.
"Without wanting to give the game completely away, they're twins, from Macedonia and..."
.. they don't have keys.
You - out.
"Laters, bro."
- Mr Douglas.
- Calum.
"- Oh, no."
- John Mercer!
I'm not staying here.
Where was it you shared the cell?
"Pentonville, wasn't it?"
- I'm not staying here.
The lad's an idiot.
- That's a bit harsh.
"Granted, he's no Stephen Hawking."
"- John, mate, don't be like that."
"- Don't ""John, mate"" me, please."
- I'm not staying here.
- You don't want to live with him?
Fine.
Get rid of him.
- John!
- What are you doing?
This way you get the flat to yourself.
"John, mate, please, I've changed a lot since then."
"I'm sorry about that deodorant, mate."
"Just tell him you'll stay with me, please."
John!
Please!
Don't...
(PHONE RINGING)
Hi.
So are we doing something tonight or not?
I can't.
My girlfriends are sleeping over.
I'm having a sleepover.
This is like the first normal thing I've done since I got pregnant.
"All right, well..."
Just let me know where I fit in here.
"Okay, I'll talk it over with Jody and Francine and I'll let you know."
(SCOFFS)
I'm just joking.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, not funny."
And...
You know what?
This isn't going to work out.
I have to go.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
"No, I have to go."
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
"And I don't like your friends, either."
They're not nice.
What does that have to do with anything?
They're still my friends.
We'll see.
"Yeah, we will."
Boyfriend problems?
He thinks my friends aren't nice.
And why would he say that?
Because they aren't.
But it's high school and you have to have friends and these are the only friends I can get right now.
My job with you always comes first.
I promise.
Come on.
We've got a million things to do.
Okay.
We've got to talk to the publicity people and set up a photo shoot.
Natalie.
I hate that picture!
"I like the other one better, the one on the trolley cars."
What do you think?
I don't know.
"Oh, my God."
It's so weird seeing myself on a bus like that.
"I mean, I can't believe it's really me up there."
I can't believe this is really happening.
"I can't believe it, either."
"I hate to bring this up, but we have work to do."
"Remember your predecessor, Marissa Kessler?"
Murder victim?
Multiple stab wounds?
Does that ring a bell?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
All right.
Randy and the Captain are probably already there.
It should be just around the corner.
It's number 24.
24. 24. 24.
Are you done?
Sorry.
Let's do this.
What's the guy's name again?
I just got so nervous.
- You were great.
- It's like a tax on the stupid.
"Come on, Randy."
We're parked out front.
Good job.
"Well, thank you, mr."
Monk.
- It was fun.
- Yeah.
I'm glad you did it.
What a fun thing to do only one time and never try it again or mention it again.
"Natalie, where you going?"
"Mr. Lawrence, I told you I wasn't an actor."
I'm so sorry.
Sorry about what?
That you did such a terrific job?
The phones are lighting up like crazy.
They love you.
And those little ad lib things you did.
You were wonderful.
Wasn't she wonderful?
So...
what do you say?
- About what?
- About doing it full-time.
It's just three nights a week.
I promise it won't interfere with your day job.
"I mean, I don't know."
You really thought I was good?
I told you when I met you you're a natural.
Mr. Monk?
"Hey, let me get two more."
And one for my buddy.
"Oh, man, you remember this?"
How could I forget it?
Good times.
Good times.
Good times.
Good times.
Yeah.
"Hey, you wanna get your sidekick under control?"
"Robbie, chill out, man."
It's $200 if I gotta recover that table.
You gonna pay for it?
"Yeah, I'll take care of it."
"Robbie, this isn't American Bandstand."
Get off the table.
"Come on, man, you're disrupting this whole establishment."
"Hey, man, you know what's good for your health?"
Get off the table.
"Police officer, put the gun down."
Hey.
No problem.
No problem at all.
"Lay it down, pal."
"Sonny, relax."
"Now this little guy didn't mean it, right?"
"Robbie, let me handle this."
Robbie!
Back off.
You never pull a gun out unless you're planning to shoot somebody.
You got it?
"Yeah, I got it."
We could've missed something.
All right?
"Look, here's the plan."
We're gonna...
"Um, start a fire in the kitchen, and it'll distract them."
Then we'll run.
There is no plan.
What are you gonna do with that?
I don't know.
I shouldn't have borrowed that money.
"No, Blair, this is not your fault."
Okay?
It's not.
All right.
Two kids come back from Christmas break.
"The first kid says to the second kid,"
I had the best Christmas ever.
"Got a new XBOX with every single game for it, a new bicycle, season tickets to my favorite basketball team."
What did you get?
"Second kid says, I only got a sweater."
"First kid says, why."
Second kid says...
"It's because I don't have cancer, Jimmy."
I know you're scared.
"No, it's..."
Actually kind of funny.
I'm pregnant.
What?
Oh my God.
I'm not.
I...
I just wanted to know what it would feel like to say that.
- Mwah!
Oh!
Mwah!
[Chuckles] Wait till I tell the ladies.
"- Okay, noon."
Noon.
"- Oh, ladies?"
Ladies!
What the hell?
What's that about?
I just wanna give them what we have.
What we have is 500 miles to drive.
"Yeah, but we came and we disrupted their lives, and I just feel like we owe them something."
"Yeah, we actually do..."
$230 for a night's stay.
Or how about you can support me on this?
I think it's disgusting.
Whoa!
What?
The two of them together is just gross!
It should be illegal!
"All right, I'm done with this."
- Come with me.
"- Dad, help me on this!"
"I'm not gonna help you, you little bigot."
Let me show you something.
See that crazy old man right there?
- He comes here every day...
- Hey!
To protest the love in this house.
"Yeah, and he's right."
Certain people just don't belong together.
It's written in my notebook right here.
See that?
"""It looks like her number came up."""
Let's see your notebook.
I didn't write it down.
I just thought of it.
"Please, come on!"
Can you believe this guy?
You know what?
"I'm gonna have your badge, officer Kil."
"Come on, Shecky, let's walk it off."
Excuse me.
I'm Stan Lawrence.
I'm the station manager.
- Here's that list you wanted.
"- Great, great."
I'll make sure they get it.
How long did she work here?
Not long.
Just a few weeks.
I still can't believe it.
I should've put more lights back here.
"No, you can't blame yourself."
It was after midnight.
The parking lot was empty.
More lights wouldn't have made a difference.
"Thank you, officer."
That's very nice of you to say.
I'm not an officer.
I work with Mr. Monk.
Is that Adrian Monk?
I've heard of him.
- A sandwich?
- Do you want to make me a sandwich?
honey.
you know I will.
Hey.
what's up?
- How's it going? but it's tomorrow.
set it up.
Are you sure?
Are you sure you can fit it in between your little palettes there?
all right then.
I'll pick you up at noon.
Get your ass back to work.
I need a word with you.
- What is it?
- l need some time off.
nothing like that.
Drake booked another fight.
It's tomorrow.
good.
Of course.
Of course.
Take the week off-- protecting my investment.
I appreciate that.
tell Todd I hope he's feeling better.
- What do you mean?
- You haven't heard?
That Victor kid kicked the crap out of him.
His mom said he worked him over really good.
When the fuck was this?
I guess.
I thought you knew.
"Please, come in."
We can do it like this.
I wouldn't like to bother you.
I have a plea for you.
- For me?
"Please, come in!"
Let's not stand here.
It's maybe inadequate.
The thing is delicate.
"They're not dangerous, aren't they?"
No... please come.
"Sit, please."
You just speak.
I don't know where to start.
Excuse me...
Have we met before?
No.
I wouldn't say so.
"You see, this is a bit..."
Would you rent me a room?
Me?
- Yes.
Have somebody send you to me?
"It's a mistake, then."
"No, I come by myself."
I heard in the neighborhood that you're a loner.
"I'm a loner, too."
"I was living in Trešnjevka, Gorjanska street."
It's a very similar street to this one.
So I thought...
I know Gorjanska street!
"You see, I was living there for two years, and now I got fired."
Leave Ringo alone.
Who the hell are you?
Let her go.
"Wait, you're him?"
Ringo...
You really are beautiful.
Mister...
You're Casshern!
No doubt about it!
They say the Ruin will stop if we eat you.
"Well, that story's too dumb for me to believe."
"But, I understand why some would want to believe it."
I've never seen a body as brand new as yours.
"But I'll never get to see it again, once I smash you--"
What are you...?
!
Mister...
S-Stop!
Don't.
I don't... wanna... die...
Ohji...
Stay away.
I don't believe my eyes.
Crying in sadness as you bid farewell.
"I thought it, but now I've seen your true colors myself."
Your ability to kill like that is impressive.
Yours is the lowest form of existence!
It always has been.
Do you know my past?
Enough to know that I want to kill you.
Tell me.
What am I?
I don't want to let them down.
"No, of course not."
"Well, I leave on Monday, and I'll be back in London for the exhibition."
I suppose it's not so very far off.
"No, it's not so very far off."
And I'll come and visit as often as I can.
"Right, then."
Veal's off.
I've ordered cutlets Milanese... and semolina... pudding.
You are Mr. Ambrose Hilliard?
Yes.
"I'm Sophie Smith, Sammy's sister."
Ah.
His office.
"Last night, he was working late."
It was bombed.
They have asked me to identify him.
I am unable.
Mr. Hilliard?
Mr. Hilliard?
"I'm afraid, my dear, someone has made a mistake."
I almost did so myself.
"You see, Sammy Smith has two fingers missing from his left hand."
"I'm sorry, we try very hard to... to make a whole person."
For the relatives.
Oh!
Is it him?
Is it your friend?
My agent.
Yes.
That's him.
"You can stay with us, if you like."
"Oh, God."
"Oh Albert, I love you."
Do it this way.
Oh yeah...
Oh Albert!
(wistful cello music)
That'll be nice.
You can pick me up at the airport Charles de Gaulle...
Anna!
I met this guy...
"I look forward to work with you, too."
"No, I talked with them yesterday."
Thank you.
"OK, goodbye."
Au revoir.
- I met this handsome guy at the gym.
- So Albert is history now?
No.
"But he needs a place to stay, so I said my flatmate was going away."
"That's fine by me, as long as you take care of it all."
"Thank you, God!"
This guy will make your mouth water!
Tell Mr Mouthwatering that he can rent my room while I'm away.
He can pick up the keys on Saturday.
I love you!
If I'd known the true identity of this Mr Mouthwatering -
- I'd never have said yes.
- I know a trick.
- What's keeping him?
- What if he can't find it?
- Relax.
He's smart and he's gorgeous.
bob?
bob?
[baby crying]
- have you seen tim?
- no. why?
- he isn't here?
- i don't know.
i just got here.
- why don't you ever know anything?
- i... i know she's -  he might not even -  hey.
you're all here!
come on. come on in.
- honey.
"oh, honey, what happened to your hair?"
and where are your glasses?
"- look at me, mom."
i'm cool!
"- i don't understand why she -  can you calm down, you beast, okay?"
his haircut ain't gonna cost you nothing.
"it's a freebie, and i can't believe i'm even saying that."
all right. hop down.
[grunts] - aah!
"- i think you might still need these, though."
come here.
- this is lovely.
"yeah, he's got it."
"- so you just remember that cool comes from the inside, okay?"
mwah!
hee-haw!
- how did you pull this off?
- let's just say that... mama made me do it.
"- mama, can we open our presents now?"
My aunt was a Grimm all these years.
I didn't even know it.
Look.
I can show you film right here that will blow your mind.
[Door closes]
Juliette!
I know how this sounds.
This is why I didn't want to tell you.
This is why my aunt told me I shouldn't be with you.
"You need to talk to somebody, Nick, but it's not me."
"Juliette, I'm trying to explain."
Okay.
"Okay, remember that hair you found on the horse when it was attacked?"
You couldn't figure out what it was.
That is what I'm talking about.
You need professional help!
"No, Juliette."
"Look, yes, I understand why you're saying that."
There's one more thing I can do to prove to you--
"- Nick, please."
"Stop, okay!"
- You're really scaring me!
- I don't want to scare you.
I just want you to know the truth.
Come with me.
Just give me this one last chance.
"Hey, Nick."
Juliette.
What a pleasant surprise.
I think.
Come on in.
All right.
Why aren't you in uniform?
It doesn't fit me anymore!
He must be a right fucking bastard!
I know what I'd have told him.
He blushed.
You should've seen him.
"Just 'cause I said ""toilet."""
"Is he good-looking, Sharon?"
"Ah, you're joking me."
You know Roland the rat?
"Well, he looks like him, only not as nice."
"He asked me why I wasn't wearing me uniform... so I stuck out me belly... and I said, ""It doesn't fit me anymore!"""
"You were dead right, Sharon."
You should've stuck one of your tits... in his mouth as well.
You should see the state of me nipples.
Jesus.
"Frank Kinsella's a ride, isn't he?"
- It wasn't him.
- I didn't say he...
It wasn't him.
It wasn't his brother.
It wasn't my brother.
It wasn't Bart Simpson.
It wasn't anybody.
"Now get off me bleedin' back, will ya?"
I'm sick of it!
- She didn't...
"- You keep out of it, right!"
"He is a ride, though, isn't he?"
Frank Kinsella.
Bitch.
"What's that that's on, Sharon?"
I'm just trying to deal with this shit. I didn 't ask forthis.
"What, and I did ?"
I climbed on top of myself and got pregnant ?
You want me to take him to my mother's ?
I'll take him.
Get his shit ready.
Get him ready !
"Oh, no."
You're not going now here with my son tonight.
"Not on that temper, and not with that attitude."
"Look, you know what ?"
Fine.
"Then, I won't take him. I'm outta here."
"Go ahead, leave."
That's what you're good at !
Your son ain't seen nothing but your back since he was born !
- [DoorCloses] - [Baby Crying]
"[Babies Crying, Murmuring]"
[Woman] Shawana Clarke.
Shawana Clarke.
Do you want me to take him ?
No.
"[Woman] Travis, come here."
"Come here, Travis."
"Travis, put that down."
Excuse me. I have been here for an hour and a half.
Am I gonna be able to see a doctor anytime soon ?
"I've already told you, we'll get you in as soon as we can."
My appointment was an hour ago.
I already got here early.
We are doing the best we can.
We have a lot of people.
"Me, too."
"Money or not, I'll stay."
I'll need a third.
"Sorry, Captain."
I have a family.
I'm not crazy.
"Captain, three men can't hold off a party of Ree, much less some boys."
"Besides, $70 ain't gonna buy nobody a new set of ears."
"A hundred, then."
This man is the only reason we're still alive.
We were 45 men when this started.
Now we're ten.
Almost nine.
HAWK:
He's my father.
He can have my share.
JIM:
"Mine, too."
He can have my share also.
All right.
"If Mr. Bridger feels the same way,"
I'll lag behind with them.
You?
Yep.
You already lost my share of the pelts so I got no choice but to make it up by some other means.
Sticking around for another day or two don't make no difference.
$300...at least I get to go home with something.
"Glass is to be cared for until, understood?"
Yeah.
You have my word.
I understand.
HENRY:
What is it?
What's wrong?
"Sorry, it's just..."
Didn't know I'd put it on.
Old habits...
It's cooler.
"Yeah, it is, isn't it?"
It is very cool.
Bow ties are cool!
"No, the room."
The room is getting colder.
She's coming back!
What's she going to do?
Is she going to punish me?
Uh... uh...
She's learnt not to melt.
"Of course, she's not really a governess, she's just a beast."
She's going to eat you.
Run.
"Children, what is exp..."
Who the devil are you?
!
What are you doing in my house?
It's OK!
"I am your governess' gentleman friend, and we've just been upstairs... kissing!"
"Captain Latimer, in the garden, there's snowmen!"
"And they're just growing, out of nowhere, all by themselves - look!"
"Good evening, I'm a lizard woman from the dawn of time and this is my wife!"
This dwelling is under attack!
"Remain calm, human scum!"
So!
Any questions?
"Well, I won it."
"Hey, mate."
I want a shot to get it back.
"Fuck you, Commodore."
I won this money.
All right?
"It's all right with me, pal."
-Good meeting' with ya.
"-Come on, Jim."
Wait a minute.
Let's play.
Did you see that good-looking girl that I was talking to leave here?
"No, I don't know where she went."
"Okay, you can turn 'em on."
I told you we shouldn'a hooked this up in the rain in the first place.
"Finish up, already."
-You check the connections?
"-Yes, I checked the connections."
-Did you check the switch?
-I checked the switch.
"Well, go check the hookup."
"Your boss say, ""Sign work both day and night."" I wanna lights on."
"-Want a cup of coffee, Nick?"
-Turn 'em on.
He's checkin' the hookup.
"Well, hurry up."
I wanna see lights on.
Turn on.
"Where the hell is it, anyhow?"
"Go around there, he said it's around to the left."
"Yeah, I think I've found it."
He would have found us anyway.
But don't think that's an end to this.
You and your bitch will regret this.
Mark my words.
- Right.
- OK.
I need a drink.
Aargh!
Hm.
Your name is reynolds and before that it was knealy.
"And you ain't never been no jones,"
- So get over it.
"- You'll never get it, will you, mama?"
You just don't understand.
"If it makes me act the way you've been acting all your life,"
- I hope i never get it!
"- Whatever, mama!"
And you know how you're always giving me those bible scriptures
And those quotes from famous people?
"Well, here's a bible scripture for you..."
"""The wealth of the wicked is laid upon the righteous."""
"Well, i am the righteousness of god."
"- Why didn't you give me that scripture, mama?"
- Oh.
Oh.
"God, forgive her."
"Oh, give me the strength."
"Hold me back, jesus."
Hold me back.
"Hey, it's me..."
Marcus.
Marcus!
Come in.
"Oh, come on."
Who'd check out some gorgeous hottie walking down the street?
- Thanks.
- I was talking about me.
Alex... there's no reason to get paranoid.
But just to be on the safe side...
- What?
- Just go with me on this.
Who was that?
No idea.
I'm really starting to like this hiding thing.
- Don't answer it.
- Not planning on it.
I have to answer it.
It's my assistant.
"Hey, Molly."
"Okay, calm down."
I'm on my way.
I have to go sign some contracts that were dropped off at my apartment by mistake.
Can we pick this up a little later?
It's not like I'm a faucet.
You can't just turn me on and off.
Step.
Step.
We're just going in there to pick up some documents.
Fine.
- And make out a little.
- Works for me.
Surprise!
"Scott, this is everybody."
"Everybody, you all know Scott-- the enemy."
Molly... you did all this for me?
- Really?
- Sure did.
"So, what made you just call me out of the blue like that?"
"Oh, well, Gary told me you said hi."
- I didn't say hi.
- You didn't?
"No, I told him to send you my regards."
I didn't say hi.
- Regards?
"- Yeah, regards."
"Anyway, I admit I was dumb to go to the bookstore to tell him I didn't say hi, but he didn't have to act so smug."
"Oh, I hate smugness."
Don't you hate smugness?
Smugness is not a good quality.
"Oh, my God, that man over there."
I think he's wearing glasses that look like Jake's.
Pull over.
Stop the car.
Here.
I think I've got a way of getting back at my ex- boyfriend.
Good.
Revenge is very good.
Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
Excuse me.
"Sir, sir?"
- Yeah.
"If you don't mind my asking, could you tell me where you got your glasses?"
- Malaysia.
- Malaysia?
Yeah.
"Look, I know this'll sound odd, but can I buy them from you?"
There's been a breach in the sim room.
JEANINE:
Get me a remote feed.
I wanna see who the hell is in there.
"The cameras are down in the sector, too."
I'm sending guards there now.
Let's go.
Bring up every cell.
Now.
Show her.
Tori finally found a way to get 'em out safely.
EVELYN:
How many others?
Every last one.
Let's go.
SOLDIER:
"South corridor, 40 yards down."
Tris?
"Tris, come on, we gotta move."
"Tris, we have to move."
I can't.
I can't.
My mom died protecting whatever's inside of this.
I have to open it for her and I think I know how.
"Tris, if we don't leave now, we're not gonna get outta here."
I have to do this first.
"Look, I know it doesn't make any sense, but you have to trust me, please."
"With my life, apparently."
MAN ON PA:
"All security teams, be advised, breach in..."
Do it.
MAX:
"I'm not prying or anything, but as the manager, I should..."
What's with the rubber bands?
"An inmate in a Tokyo prison put 11 rubber bands around his neck and managed to commit suicide,"
so I wondered if that's possible.
Turns out it kinda works.
"Oh yeah, you could die."
You okay?
Yeah.
This is intense.
"We're done filming, thank you."
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
"Kim, they're done on floor 2, so grab some guys and clean up."
Miyu.
What?
"Porn wasn't... your first time, was it?"
First what?
First time having sex.
"No, of course not."
Someone you liked?
Yeah.
Glad to hear that.
But he died in the tsunami.
"We're leaving, Azusa."
Okay.
See you.
Maybe I'll come again.
"No, don't come."
"We're staying overnight, right?"
"Yeah, choose any room."
"Any room, really?"
The cheapest is fine.
- No.
- Huh?
Are you goin' sick?
- No!
"What do you say we ""popeye"" down to the Chez and have a couple of drinks?"
- I'm beat.
I'm gonna go home.
- All right.
One drink.
- Drink this.
- Whip it out. [Laughs]

So h-how am i gonna get these doses of sage wisdom
When i'm living at the dorms at n.y.u.?
I'll appear to you like obi-wan.
Now go young jedi.
All right. bye. have fun.
Our kids graduated high school today.
And i felt... old.
And so i wanted to do something young and crazy
And you're the only one i wanted to do it with.
Something I found in Chuck's room.
Well then I bet it's good.
Are you dressing for someone?
Yes.
Someone I hope is finally ready to love me
The way Cyrus loves you.
Cyrus told me.
You told Chuck how you felt and...
He ran away.
You seeing him tonight?
Yes.
Don't let him get away again
Oh..
Hey..drunky.
Don't embarrass yourself.
Dan.
You're here.
There's something I have to tell you
And it's only because I'm drunk
And I'll probably never see you again.
I um....
Oh God.
I have to go.
Turn over the money I only took in this much all day!
How can I?
So what!
?
"Come on, come on"
Turn over the money
Bring it here!
"I've paid the fee everyday, Master"
But business was bad today
Please be patient!
Don't think you can put it off!
Stop!
You bastards
You drink the people's blood!
Let's see how fast you can kill me!
Beat him!
You bully as too much!
"Well, go teach them a lesson!"
Okay!
Use this
Okay
What are you doing?
Let us borrow this for a minute!
Stop!
What are you doing?
Go after you've paid the fees!
Fees?
What fees?
I don't have any money!
"I have a life, though!"
That's enough!
I'll see how hard your bones are!
What are you looking for?
- Death?
- That's funny.
That's all the Death Zone offers your people.
I'm looking for a man.
He is not a man!
His blood is as black as coal!
You know it.
I saw how he buried you alive.
For him you are dead now.
It will not give you more trouble.
I stole something.
Something very special.
What?
My daughter.
Is the child yours?
- Little?
- Yeah.
But I thought she was one of them.
Can you take me with her?
"Dangerous, she is protected."
"Please, Atka."
My life is nothing without it.
"Quannik thought, that the time of red blood soon ends."
Soon comes the time of black blood.
He lives for 143 years.
Many of his visions came true.
He said there will be no cure for black blood.
Ash is nearby.
I can feel his presence.
Its smell is lifeless.
Your path does not make sense.
"Look, I said I was out."
"I know, I know."
I respect your decision.
This is for Morgan.
He was your patient.
He talk about medieval torture?
In disturbing detail.
Big weirdo.
"Well, see ya."
"Annie, wait."
You just said you respected my decision.
It's not about that.
I have a favor to ask you.
A favor for you is like the kiss of death.
"I need you to go to this address and babysit on this guy for the day, make sure he stays sober."
- Not interested.
- I'll pay you.
"Look, I know I'm an asshole."
And I've been reckless... but everything I've done was to try to protect us.
"And I can fix this, but I need your help."
Who is he?
He's a friend.
$50 an hour.
"You really will be a millionaire one day, Annie."
I know.
"Hey,"
I bet this is one of them self-melting driveways.
Yeah.
I bet you should've been a football player.
Yeah.
Mrs. Dixon?
What's going on?
Get away from the clown car...
- Nate:
"It's gonna be okay, sweetheart."
- You asshole!
She shouldn't have to bear witness to your hate!
You like that?
!
It's the hose of justice!
- The hose of just... oh.
- [Stops spraying]
"Well, obviously, I'm not gonna spray you."
How can you defend him?
"He's a pediatrician, for god sakes."
We trusted him with our children.
"Yeah, so did I, and he's got a very gentle hand."
Don't use us as propaganda!
What are you guys doing over there?
Get in here.
- We're on the right side!
"- No, you're not!"
"Fine, you're gonna have to spray..."
"Dad, I can't believe you sprayed... aah!"
Protestors:
Ohh!
Aah!
Get in here and get changed for the wedding.
What the hell?
!
Seriously!
Aah!
We've got you on camera.
You're gonna regret this.
"Me and him, we had a... talk."
A talk?
Sometimes that's all it takes.
Chivonne?
You won't have no more problems with him.
I promise.
Thanks.
I liked walking you home the other day.
I was thinking maybe we can make it a habit.
Don't.
Don't what?
I know what you want.
For you and me.
But I can't do it.
What you did doesn't change things between us.
It doesn't make us family.
I came to you because I had to.
Do you understand?
I understand.
You do what you need to do.

I know. I know.
"So, your dad's trippin' about the flight."
-Yeah.
-Probably thinks it's Derek's fault.
"No, I explained about Nikki."
"So, you put it all on her."
None of it's on you.
She started it.
I told you what she said.
"Maybe she didn't have no business getting up in your face, but she had reason to say what she said."
Wait a minute.
You agree with her ?
You and Derek act like it don't bother people to see you together.
Like it don't hurt people to see.
"Well, we like each other."
What is the big damn deal ?
"It's me and him, not us and other people."
"Black people, Sara."
Black women.
Derek's about something.
Did you know everybody at this school?
"Got to watch where you're going, man."
"Leave him alone, Dirk."
"You never learn, do you, midget?"
"Get to the bus, Barry."
What's the matter?
You scared?
Don't worry.
I'll go easy on you this time.
"Come on, Lose-Chester."

"Come on, freak!"
Freak!
You're not tough.
You're just a jerk.
"""Dirk the jerk."""
"""Dirk the jerk."" Yeah, that's pretty good."
Dirk the jerk.
"So, you were friends with Dirk?"
"Yes, sir, in high school."
I don't recall Dirk having many friends at Truman.
"Here, sit."
Sit down.
"When did, uh -- when did Dirk pass?"
He was 18.
What happened to him?
"Well, there was, first, drinking, then drugs, and then too many drugs."
And then he just slipped through my fingers.
It was my fault.
"I should have seen it coming, you know?"
"Dirk, he, uh -- well, he had his troubles."
What kind of troubles?
And I'll get you away from here.
"No, no, francis."
There's something else that you must do.
"Everything I did, I did for you."
You needn't remind me.
I need you to forget all of it.
What?
Everything I warned you of.
The warnings I gave mary.
"Go to her, tell her that I believe"
The two of you can be wed.
I don't understand.
Your fate has changed.
"Oh, what does it matter?"
You never believed
That nostradamus had the power
To see the future anyway.
What matters is that you love mary.
I did love mary.
You destroyed that.
Nonsense.
"She's with bash now, but she loves you."
You don't know that.
I don't know that.
What matters is what you want.
Is it mary?
Is it to save my life?
Is it the throne of France?
Is it the safety of your brothers?
"Say it, say it!"
I know it's true!
Yes.
Yeah!
"Yeah, yeah, kid, she's hot as a torch, but you don't know anything about her."
- I know plenty.
- Yeah?
Where's she from?
Somewhere else.
Why'd she leave?
Who cares?
"Her past doesn't matter, long as her future's with me."
"Oh, Petey, ever since this girl came to town, you got a dream in your head where your sense ought to be."
"- You know what, Dad?"
- What?
You're right.
Petey...
"I love you, Nicky Johnson."
Marry me.
Marcy came to see me.
She's fine.
Thought you'd like to know that.
Why didn't you bring her home?
She's 18.
"She's still my little girl, Agent Kelton."
"I'm sorry about that, but there was nothing I could do."
What we need to talk about is Curtis McNeal.
"Yeah, I just heard."
It's terrible.
"So what aren't you telling me, Senator?"
Excuse me?
"Look, I've worked a lot of kidnaps, but this one's different."
"They're trying to get to you, and they're trying to get to me."
Why?
I have no idea.
"Sis, if you only told me we're going here, I should've worn rubber shoes and pants!"
To think I gave too much effort.
Sis?
"Sis, are you okay?"
.
Do you know that Migs proposed to me in front of that tree?
"He told me, however strong that tree is, that's how strong his love for me is."
That's why I want to see that tree.
"As long as that tree is right there,"
I won't lose hope.
"Everything will be alright, Sis."

"But he seemed love, poor guy."
"Do not bother, you might You may be of help."
I was wondering who posted photos of my investigative files on the Internet.
He is not.
It can not be he said.
But you could be you.
Why would I do?
Because you hate cops.
Nothing!
Be careful who you get your information from.
- That guy is out for blood.
- Let me go.
It was an accident.
And it wasn't me.
It was my partner.
I didn't even draw my weapon.
"If you killed someone, I'd cover for you too."
Is that wrong?
Let's go to Marina's house.
"No, how could he be the father?"
He's 87 years old!
"Tell them I'll do anything, I don't care."
- Hello?
- It's me.
"Hi, Marina."
I wanted to know what's happening with Malaga.
When will they call me?
"Look, there was a problem with your contract."
They're not hiring anyone until next year.
Talk to them.
"Tell them I'll do anything, I don't care."
I have to get out of here.
I can't take it anymore.
Let's meet.
At the usual spot in half an hour.
She called this number.
It's the hunting lodge.
It's okay.
Coming!
Who is it?
# I need you to know that I love you
# I want to be the man you hoped I'd be
# To find my place amongst the crowd
# To see your face
# And know
# You're proud of me. #
Hewitt?
Was Baker not on your tram?
"No, sir."
That'll do it.
Here they come.
"Purcell, boys."
Too early for Humperdinck.
"Sorry, I'm not sure where I should stand for the microphone."
Probably best if I conduct.
"Get a chair for Miss Riall out of the way, Lionel."
Right you are.
Should I just warm them up?
"Oh, I don't think we need bother with that."
"Round about this tempo, boys."
Once through for luck.
"I didn't get the chance to ask, are we all here?"
Apart from Baker.
Baker?
But he was so excited about it.
Did he send a message?
No.
Just didn't turn up.
So he's out.
"Well, I'm very disappointed."
I had great hopes of Baker.
Aren't you disappointed?
Teaching me.
Here it is madam 42 it'll be perfectly fit.
"Dad, listen to me."
Brother.
"Not 42, give size 40."
42 will be perfectly fine.
"Brother I said not 42, give size 40."
What are you saying?
How do you know?
It's my size.
Do you know better or me?
I can tell the size of bra by looking at the blouse.
You know my nature.
Her husband even ask me for her size.
150 please.
Here.
Give me a bag.
What's the bag for?
You're going to wear it anyway.
"Dad, You'll have to leave for Pondi."
There you'll have to meet our designer who's worked on our valentines collection.
Actually I've seen the designs on the internet.
You just need to go and make an agreement with her.
Okay I'll go.
Don't you worry.
And if you like the design give her 100000.
She need it.
Okay.
What her name?
"Shut up, Not yours."
Leave the bra.
Speak.
They attract.
Simply great!
I deeply regret to have called you.
I won't make this mistake again!
A lady has come to see you.
"All right, come"
Didn't I say I'd drop in someday?
And here I am.
You did say.
But I never expected you.
I don't know how to welcome you.
Anybody there?
"Yes, sir?"
What would you have?
Hot or cold?
Any cold drink.
"- Two cold drinks.- l will bring now, sir."
How is your father?
is that Mr Vijay's photograph?
- Yes.
He is my only friend.
Which is why I have kept his photograph.
But the walls in this room are still empty.
Why don't you fill it up with some good photographs?
Shall I ?
"Yes, Mr Daaga?"
What's up?
Don't you wory.
What am I here for?
So what ifyour men are guilty of murder?
I am there to save them.
See this bungalow!
- lt's okay.
"But look, I landed it right?"
That's all that matters.
I don't think so.
- l don't think that's all that matters.
- Say what you mean.
I'm proud of you.
I'm glad you landed the account...
- and you're fired.
- What?
You're fired because I love you... because I don't want to lose you.
"No, no, Patty, it's okay, I can fix my responsibilities."
"I know, but you're not happy, you're not."
You're...
Something has to change.
- What will we do?
I mean...
- l don't know.
- What will I do?
I don't even...
- l don't know what you're going to do.
I guess you're finally going to figure it out.
"- You know that girl, Angela Chase?"
- That redheaded girl?
Yes.
Some redhead.
It's out of a bottle.
- Anyway. is she avoiding us?
- l think she is.
I think we make her physically ill or something.
I thinks so because...
Angela.
Jim.
"Come on, kids."
Time to go now.
BRlCE:
"I'm sorry, Lutie."
I shouldn't have come back.
I've brought everything to life again.
"And the children, Brice, they don't know me."
I'm not sure they even liked me.
They were just waiting for the time to go home.
They don't need me.
They don't need anything from me.
"Listen to me, Lutie, you and I, we could get Brock."
He's ours.
Let Brewton have Sarah Beth.
We could take Brock away.
He belongs with you and me.
We'd get as far away from here as trains could carry us.
"This is our last chance, Lutie."
The last chance for the three of us.
"I can't go away with you, Brice."
"I can't have Brock and I can't have Sarah Beth so I'm gonna go, but I'll go alone."
And you've got nothing for me;
"Not enough, Brice."
Not enough for that.
Come on in.
Doc.
"Glad Mac got you here, Jim."
Haven't been seeing very much of you lately.
-l haven't been looking for you.
-So I noticed.
I used to love you like the son I never had.
"Hogarth, we've been through this before."
No pets.
"But he's not a pet, Mom."
He's a friend.
We've got to rent a room if we're gonna make ends meet...
... andnoonewants shredded upholstery.
You won't know he's there.
I'II cage him.
until you feel sorry for him and set him free in the house!
"Do you remember the raccoon, Hogarth?"
I remember the raccoon.
"please, Mom, at Ieast look at him."
AII right.
Where is this guy?
I can't read this handwriting.
"That one should have lettuce, tomato, extra mayo."
"I will go get him, okay?"
So he wants us to hold the mayo and the mustard.
How about just hold the flavor altogether?
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Sir?
Excuse me--!
-What's that?
-please don't move.
My pet's under your table.
Don't look!
"If you make a scene, my mom won't let me keep him."
"-What kind of pet, kid?"
-A squirrel.
He's friendly.
"I'm telling the truth, dang it!"
- Me?
- And then he literally zipped his lips and threw away the key.
What's he gonna tell you?
"What, am I a fortune teller?"
You gonna put him in a room with me?
"Stripped, bound, and shackled."
"I told him nobody would be listening, but I was lying."
Man of the hour.
Who's speaking?
You have zero idea what he wants to tell you?
Invite me to Ruby's talent show?
Where are you?
"Market, crossing Geary."
DeBray's in the car ahead of me with Sarneau.
"All right, I'll see you in 30 seconds."
I'm headed out the door.
"If you want to shoot me in the back, my spinal column starts right here."
Get an ambulance!
"Stand back, sir."
"Hey, hey!"
What did you have to tell me?
They stopped looking for... ffor me.
Who did?
Who?
They didn't keep looking...
Who didn't keep looking?
The whole world's looking for you.
Who?
Hey!
Hey!
He...
"He took mine, so I..."
Gray sedan.
New York plates.
I've been a bad mother.
I did a terrible thing to let this happen to you.
It's all my fault.
I have an addiction.
You're so much stronger than I am.
"Time's up, Patrick!"
Drop the weapon!
Yaaah!
"Ok, bet's to you, General."
"All right, I see you and raise you 10 bucks."
"Oh, hell, no."
I'm out.
Too rich for me.
"All right, that general's out."
And the host makes 3.
"Ok, I'm really trying to figure out which one of y'all is bluffing."
The retired marine general of Mr. Rock and Roll hall of fame over here.
This hand's too good to waste on a bluff.
Ooh.
"Is that the lyric to one of yours songs, Joe?"
"All right, I think both of y'all are bluffing."
So here's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna see your 10 and I'm gonna raise you 20.
Mm-mm-mm.
What you think about that?
Step up.
Seriously.
"""Never interrupt an enemy when he's making a mistake."""
Ooh!
"Sun Szu, ""Art of War,"""
So why didn't they--
Why didn't they use Dave?
Because Dave was late to get in makeup.
"But by the time we did the scene, he was ready."
They just said no.
"I don't know, really."
Hi.
"I got you, man."
I got you.
We had people standing by.
We had no idea what we could do without Toxie.
And nobody could call.
But let's just-- can we get past this?
All we did was this long shot with a fucking
Shitload of smoke.
"Yeah, can we do it again with me?"
All right.
Let's see what I can do.
DAVE:
Tell me what you want me to do.
All right.
Trent give me some blocking here.
TRENT HAAGA:
Do you want to pick this one up from that point?
Just have him get up--
Can we just fill him up with smoke
And have him bring the kids on again?
Why?
I don't want to do it again.
-All right.
-Absolutely not.
"In fact, if it happens again, there's gonna"
- (SCOFFS) - (ENGINE STARTS)
(BIRDS CHIRPING)
"All due respect, I am the best equipped to go."
How many wars have you been through?
- My share.
- It should be me.
You?
You haven't fought in a battle.
This is about us getting home to our loved ones.
Why would you...
I have no loved ones.
"If I fail, you can still go on."
It's me.
I'm going and I'm not going to fail.
You're new here.
It's about getting back to Henry.
I don't care what I have to face.
You're not gonna argue with me?
Would it do any good?
No.
You got anything in that bag that's gonna help me with a giant?
Or Hook?
Hey!
Come with me.
This.
Powder made from poppies.
He has to inhale it.
And your sword.
How strong is it?
The most powerful blade in all the realms.
Is it strong enough to cut through that beanstalk?
Indeed.
And no more car privileges.
Give me your keys.
Give 'em to me!
"Oh, for the love of God."
"Mom, you want me to... no."
"Mom, come on, let me just... mom."
Mom!
What is going on with you?
Is this about Allison?
Do you really wanna know?
Yeah.
Is this about your father?
"It is, isn't it?"
"Okay, you know what, um..."
We'll talk about this at home.
I'm gonna go get the car.
I'm the worst son ever.
"Well, I'm not exactly winning any prizes either."
Dammit!
"You give him a restraining order, and he's mocking you!"
He was mo... and what do I do about going to the bathroom?
So why do we need their help?
Because it's harder to kill than I thought.
I still don't know who it is.
And they do?
They might.
Which is why I need one of you to get on their good side.
Scott or Stiles?
Either.
"You know, the full moon's coming, Derek."
I'm aware of that.
These look comfortable.
- It's never been about sex.
I don't understand.
Things were going so well.
Having sex now will ruin everything.
You're a very sick man.
Mmm.
"Johnson's been around both leagues, but seems to have found a home here in the Bronx."
He's leading the American league with a 2.34 ERA and 24 strikeouts.
And strike three.
That makes strikeout number 25 for Johnson in this young season.
- I have the game on for you.
- Oh.
Great.
- Some wine?
- I'll wake up with a headache.
- One glass.
"- All right, one glass."
Same score?
This is good.
Sweet.
I normally don't like sweet.
I'm glad you like it.
Do you...
Would you mind terribly if we muted the TV?
- What are you doing?
- Nothing much.
All right.
Would it be all right if I sat down?
- The wine made me warm.
- I can fix that.
- Good game?
- I can't hear.
- I have the rights to adoption.
- Never!
Thanks for freeing me.
I had no means... to get out.
Carry your papers... and no one will hassle you.
I didn't know that.
"It won't happen again, brother."
Have you finished?
- Have some more.
- I'm full.
You can always eat a little more.
- Have a roll.
"- I can't, really."
Try the salad.
Don't refuse everything.
Have some fruit.
I'll have a banana.
- I'm leaving now.
- Already?
"Wait for me, I'll wash my hands."
"As I foresaw, your employment has been arranged."
Come to the factory tomorrow.
There's no need for a ride.
- How will you go back?
"- On foot, as usual."
- I'll show you out.
- Don't bother.
Good evening!
Balla!
They set you free?
My boss paid for me.
Liar!
Get out!
Get out!
I helped you!
Out!
Shame on you!
You rat!
You swine!
Get out!
"""She's so gentle, so faithful..."""
I almost killed you... like I killed Ida.
"I want to go straight, but it's too hard."
Guys like me never get a break.
I'm going for a drive in the country with Karl.
I'm tired of doing nothing.
We've got some accounts to settle in Weissensee.
Ede and Biberkopf have to go along.
- You're taking Franz?
- Yeah.
When will you be back?
Tonight at the earliest.
All right.
"Hello, young lady."
My friend Biberkopf sent me with a message.
He'll be home late tonight.
He asked you to come by?
Not exactly.
I just thought I'd come over and patch things up from last night.
- What do you really want?
- I told you!
"And there's nothing wrong with calling on a pretty girl, is there?"
"I thought, ""It's a beautiful day."
"Let's drive out into the country."""
"Mom, Dad, you did all the hard work getting me through high school."
You deserve a gift.
But what do you get the Cadillac of parents?
A Rolls-Royce.
"Oh, my goodness!"
How did you afford that?
"- It was only $2,000."
- Huh.
"Judge Thompson, from the club,"
- got me into a police auction.
- Huh.
"If I had 40 more dollars, you'd be looking at a speedboat."
"So, what do you think?"
It's... it's wow.
- Right?
!
"- I loved the macaroni necklace he made me in first grade, and I even used the perfume he gave me in fifth grade, but this car is so gaudy."
People are gonna think I played for the Knicks in the '70s.
It's the most beautiful gesture
- I have ever seen.
- (car door opens)
It's 100% class.
"Hey, Mom, didn't you say you had some errands to run?"
Oh.
I... in a little while.
"Uh, yeah."
"But... um, gosh, it's got fur."
Wow.
It's like driving a lion.
"Hey, before you go, give us a honk."
All right.
"(horn honks to the tune of ""We're in the Money"")"
"- Yeah, why do you care?"
You only get to do a first date once.
It should be... fun and sexy and...
ask really good questions.
Ask him why he first decided he wanted to save lives.
"Ooh, ask him what his best surgery ever was."
I know how to go on a date.
Why is Meredith eating pot roast?
It's a show lunch for the mommy.
She's freaking out.
That ponytail?
It's gonna blow.
"Derek tells me you--you, uh, grew up right here in Seattle."
Are your parents...
"Mm, dead."
Mer's mother died last year.
"Oh, I'm so sorry."
And your father?
Oh.
"You know, I should go check on the patient who's the serial killer."
Who's here.
"Not killing people, so that's good."
- I should go.
- Yeah.
"Family isn't her favorite topic, okay?"
She's had a rough time of it.
- I didn't say a word.
- I know what you're thinking.
I was thinking...
It must be awful for you.
Treating a murderer.
Dad died a long time ago.
Of course I am.
I'm fine.
"Hey, Mom."
Mom.
"Hey, Mom."
What?
I'm trying to sleep.
"Uh, I was just making sure you're alive."
"I'm sorry, sweetie, it was a late night."
My head is throbbing.
"Yeah, um, I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't bring the party home."
I'm sure the neighbors would appreciate it.
It wasn't a party.
It was one guy.
Don't be so judgy.
"Yeah, well, I talked to Roberta at the Grill."
And there's still a bartending position open if you wanted to get a job.
"Well, I figured she'd still be pissed about the last time I worked there."
I think she's desperate.
I'll check it out.
- Yeah?
- Don't act so surprised.
I just...
I didn't know how long you planned on sticking around.
"- Well, there is back rent due."
"- There's back everything, Mom."
"Like I said, I'll check it out."
- Who's that?
- It's Caroline.
Easy.
Yeah.
Come in.
I'm only asking you to do it so that you can have the success you deserve.
Every bit of it.
Blake Carrington's a very smart man.
He'd know the difference.
Not if you control yourself.
Just joking.
"Now, don't be upset."
I thought you loved me.
"I'm sorry, it was-"
It was only an idea.
Bad idea.
You're right.
Sleeping with him is too risky.
"Anyway, I want you for myself."
Believe that.
Oh.
L.B.
What are you doing here?
"It's the man's birthday today, and that kiss was his present."
That damned kid.
He follows me everywhere.
What if he tells somebody about what he just saw?
"That is a problem, isn't it?"
"Well, why don't you just see to it that he doesn't?"
Mother.
Welcome home.
Adam.
Mm.
I can't tell you how proud I am of you.
And happy to be working together again?
Yes.
"Oh, what have we here?"
Hi.
Good morning.
"My day, like your smile, is brighter ♬"

"You, who shorten the street between us, are good.  ♬"

What is this?
Noona's has work now so I won't be able to take care of you as often.
So eat a lot.
Your sister wasn't even able to sleep last night because she was preparing all this.
So eat up and go to school already.
I'm so sad.
What's with you face.
Your friends don't give you food at their house?
Noona.
Ah for real.
If your that worried why don't you follow him with a bowl.
"It's all right, Bobby."
We're here together.
"Go to sleep, Bobby."
Go back to sleep.
"It's all right, Bobby."
It's all right.
Go back to sleep.
We're here together.
I think we could all use one of those.
Mr. Gordon?
Shall we go into the other room?
Let's go.
Get started on the clock.
"Stan and I had a brother, Bobby."
He was younger than either of us.
Not quite 7 when he died.
Stan and I were 12 and 14.
We lived in a big house with grounds that bordered a river.
"That particular day, our mother asked us to stay at home and look after Bobby."
We wanted to go swimming.
"What we wanted to do, Bobby wanted to do, naturally."
He idolised his big brothers.
"So we told him to stay in the house, and off we went."
He followed us.
We were pretty far out when we spotted him.
He was trying to...
To get to us.
He still is.
- You mean it's his...?
- Spirit?
Ghost?
"I don't know, Mr. Gordon."
- Eventually.
"But for now, we keep a low profile."
- No one knows who I am.
- The Salvatore brothers do.
And I wish to hell I could run into them.
They're the reason we were caught in the first place.
"So, uh, Matt, how do you like working here?"
"Uh, it's not that bad."
Wait staff tips out pretty good.
They can't keep a bartender to save their lives but...
I actually put my mom up for the job.
"How's that been, having Kelly back?"
"You know, same old Kelly."
"She's trying, sort of."
Kelly and my mom were best friends growing up.
That's how Matt and I first met.
We shared a crib together.
You're kidding.
"No, we've known each other our whole lives."
Whoo!
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Little Jen.
"- Oh, my God."
I know.
- It's big Jen now.
Let's have another one.
How many is that?
Ha-ha-ha.
Where are you going?
Bethanne and I are going out for a bit.
Hit the town.
Kick up our heels.
Little?
Any newbie can do it.
It will make no difference.
"How can you say that, Je?"
No difference?
It was a simple little job.
Be reasonable.
You turned off your mobile for half a day.
What was I supposed to do?
I had to fix it.
You weren't here.
Are you seeing someone now?
The hell!
Have you ever seen me with a girl?
No.
"But if you do, that's cool."
But turning off your cell phone.
That's too much.
"Normally you're more professional than this, you know?"
It's good that I noticed it first.
How could you miss that?
Even I noticed it.
"""Normally you're more professional than this, you know?"""
Shit!
It's not going away.
Not better.
So tired.
A waste of time.
What am I doing?
Hold on.
Shit!
November.
Boy:
Shake it!
Shake it!
Shake it!
But Jules and Laurie are!
What?
How?
We're going in!
"Laurie, this is why I love you!"
I can do anything when I'm with--
Laurie?

Give me the money.
Thank you.
That sure is a lot of milk money.
"Kevin, some things are more important than milk, all right?"
"Well, what do you need all this money for, anyway?"
"Oh, we're going to buy a pros thetic leg."
For his dog.
His dog lost his leg.
"So, what'd you tell your dad?"
I said I was eating at Kevin's house.
I said I was eating at Brad's house.
I said I was eating at Frank's house.
He burned them.
Where?
Where?
In the kitchen.
Bastard!
You!
What did you come here to do?
What did you come here to do?
Ask him again.
What did you come here to do?
To travel.

Tell him I'll throw him in jail if he doesn't fess up.
Tell us the truth.
"Even if I told you, you wouldn't believe me."
He says you wouldn't believe him.
"Look, you translate everything I say,"
- word for word.
"- Yes, sir."
You fucking prick!

"So, uh..."

Why was this in your house?
How did this...?
Who the fuck are you?
Who are you?
I know what you're doing in this village.
I saw that room.
And I know what the fuck you're doing to my daughter!
Come in.
Merry Christmas.
It's been a long time.
It is Christmas.
You don't have to explain a gift.
Thank you.
Come in.
Let me take your coat.
I can only stay a moment.
I have to deliver a few more things.
- Can I fix you a drink?
"- No, thank you."
"Well, come in, sit down."
"Well, I really came to... ."
Is it true that you might go to Portland?
"Well, I've received the offer."
"It's a larger school, and naturally, much more money."
- You'll take it.
- I don't know.
I have a week to make up my mind.
Sit down.
- Michael?
- Yes?
You were right.
I never thought I could say it but you were right.
- About what?
"During the past months, I've been able to come to a few conclusions about myself."
- And what were they?
"- Well, Michael, I've lied so long."
"I was everything you said, especially that night in the kitchen."
I wanted you more than you wanted me.
- I had no right to say those things.
"Here, in my head."
What's your name?
You don't want to tell me!
What about you?
How old are you?
I see.
You're not very talkative!
Are you hungry?
Thirsty?
Good that's a start!
But I would like to hear the sound of your voice.
Maybe you aren't able to speak!
Is that it?
Are you mute?
"Poor wretches, they are mute!"
"Monique, bring them some grenadine."
I understand.
You have to leave.
Let me look at you a while longer.
I'm afraid I may never see you again.
"Listen, I would never betray you."
You can always think of me as a friend!
Are you afraid of those girls?
Cowards.
Coward
You're running away.
You're terrified.
I'm not afraid of them.
I'm going.
I'll bring you back their heads.
Where are they?
- I'm not afraid.
You have company.
Just texting my girlfriends.
It's time for me to leave.
"Oh, It's only 9:00."
"We could have some coffee, watch a movie."
More cake?
"Oh, the cake was awesome."
"But really, I don't want to overstay my welcome, so, Dylan, do you want to walk me to the door?"
"Go ahead, Dylan."
Go ahead.
Of course.
What are you doing?
Ben has been waiting for hours.
"Oh, I doubt it."
You doubt it?
"Okay, let me rephrase that."
I don't care.
I don't care about Ben.
I care about you.
And I did see you first at that party and I am really smitten with you.
And I'm angry with myself for stepping aside for my friend.
You slept with Ben's wife that night.
"Yeah, I did."
"And it was a huge mistake, huge."
"But stepping aside, huger mistake."
He doesn't deserve you.
He's in love with Amy.
"He's always been in love with Amy, so don't waste your time."
And I hope you'll give me a chance.
"Good night, Robert."
"Good night, Cecilia."
BOTH:
Who asked you to lie?
They asked where my uncle was.
I said that he'd left.
They asked how he was and you said he'd left.
We don't want anything from your uncle.
They asked me.
I said that he had left.
They asked how she was.
It wasn't about your uncle.
Have they taught you anything at school?
Yes.
You don't give an answer until you're asked a question.
"Yes, I've been taught that."
I don't want any more bread.
You understand?
"If you have good news, come here."
"If not, don't bother coming back!"
All right.
- Understand?
- Yes.
Put the bread down there and go.
"Hello, engineer."
My mother wants to know if you want the milk cold or hot.
Warm it up.
Good day.
"There's nothing more to say, Mrs Godarzi."
As I told you before.
"No, it's the same."
What?
"No, we don't know what to do."
What does that mean?
"That's impossible, Mrs Godarzi."
But you can tell me some of the stuff you write about.
What for?
You wouldn't understand.
Why wouldn't I?
Because you live different.
That's true.
But I've also lived like you.
I also wrote in my diary.
Do you still have it?
I've lost it.
But do you remember the things you wrote?
Some of them.
Tell me.
See how one can't tell a thing about that?
It must've been too boring.
Why?
I remember how I wrote the things that happened to me.
For example:
"""I woke up at 8."
"It was cold."""
The bed was warm.
"""I was almost late... because Jacoba took too long to make breakfast."""
Things like that.
I've dreamt about dogs.
-With dogs?
Yes.
That happened very often.
I saw a square full of dogs.
"They moved, sniffed around..."
There wasn't any people.
Only dogs!
"And sometimes, me."
"Cover him, Ria."
Mr. de Vries... you're a doctor.
Mr. Reve!
Calm down.
What a shame we have to meet here.
Tension gauge.
Life takes strange turns.
I didn't know you were a doctor.
That's why matters of life and death interest me.
Bloem!
"Thinking of death I cannot sleep, remember?"
How is he?
How's Herman?
- He's in very bad shape.
- Dead?
Yes.
A friend of yours?
A relative?
The fourth man!
I told him but he wouldn't believe me.
"Doctor, the liver."
"Now Herman can go into a vase too, he can..."
- Enlarged but intact.
- Normal reflexes.
- She's done it again.
- You've had a lucky escape.
But she's done it again the fourth man.
She takes him like a spider a spider also fucks her mate and then devours him... dead!
Quite a shock for you.
"Keep on talking, it'll settle you down."
"She's a spider, a witoh."
She leads men to ruin.
Hey.
Constantino and those trucks are right on your doorstep.
You don't have much time.
What about that train?
"20 minutes, give or take."
"Tell me you have a plan, a really good one."
"Hey, I need to borrow your tank."
It won't fire.
"I told you that, right?"
There's not a single round of ammo in it.
I'm not planning on shooting anything.
"Uh, the throttle's there on your left."
"And to steer, you're just gonna..."
Hey.
This is not my first time.
Jake.
Good luck out there.
Yeah.
"You, too."
"Any minute now, huh?"
Yeah.
"I'm, uh..."
"You know, he's here, watching."
"You know that, right?"
They still doing the bunny hop in there?
I think it's the Macarena.
The what?
"Yeah, they're still doing the bunny hop."
Quite a speech you made in there.
I had no idea you were such a sentimental fool.
Mom wrote it.
You think?
He sees you and loves you.
Where is our mother?
Don't you know yourself when you have to urinate?
We can't help you with that.
Hello?
Untie me.
Now clean the bed.
Take the sheets off.
"Come on, get them off."
Elias?
Where is our mother?
"Elias, come here."
Where is she?
All right.
"Elias, let's make a deal."
I'll play the game again.
I will talk again to Lukas.
Lukas will live again.
"I'll make breakfast for the both of you, ready your clothes."
"We do everything again, as before."
But you have to believe me that I am your mother.
And you honestly want to do that?
I promise.
Elias ...
It's not your fault that Lukas died.
The accident was not your fault.
Do you really believe her?
She's lying.
Let her prove that she is our mother.
What do I do now?
What is Lukas now doing?
But I can't see him!
Your old man gonna be okay with this?
Don't worry about him.
He's fine.
"Yeah, I won't worry about him when he's ripping my fucking dick off."
Do you need me to sign something?
Good.
Relax.
"Look what you're doing with your shoulders, right?"
It's...
- Right?
- Okay.
Don't be wild.
And turn it over.
Nice and relaxed.
"Yeah, we're having fun."
You're not leaving yourself any room.
"So, what is she doing wrong?"
You need to stay back.
You're crowding your punch.
Crowding your punch.
"You come in here, you're not getting the full extension."
Right.
"The first one is here, here, and here."
You know what it's setting up?
"- Look what's coming, right?"
- Mm-hmm.
"If you throw it and you stay there, what's gonna happen?"
"I'm gonna knock you the fuck out, all right?"
Good.
"Come on, move."
Move.
Here I come.
"Rose, I came by your office today for lunch, but you weren't there."
- Were you at a staff meeting?
- I had lunch with Henry.
"Rose, he's a friend of mine, but you have to watch out for him."
"Believe me, I'm not his type."
He has trouble controlling himself.
- Oh.
- What?
What?
What?
- Did you pull something?
- I think so.
Right here.
A little lower.
Lower.
Closer to the spine.
There.
"Oh, yeah."
Lean back into it.
I thought you might like to meet me in Europe after your classes end.
We never had a honeymoon.
That's right.
I would love that.
- Would you?
- Mmm.
- Am I pressing too hard?
"- No, but I'm all sweaty."
And I have to floss.
"When you've got to floss, you've got to floss."
"Claire, I don't know how to ask for it."
"We're so polite, I feel like we're roommates in a charm school."
- I'm putting you on the speaker.
"Sure, but do you ever do anything about it?"
I lay them by the dozen if need be.
Don't you?
What do you think I did with Chrissy last night?
But Christine has often walked down the aisle.
Never had any luck.
Take me to the studios some time.
Stupid bitoh!
Wait... stop!
Stop!
You got something going with her?
!
I saw that woman in a dream!
Ma'am!
"Nothing, I guess."
Probably screwing on some tombstone.
I read about them: cemetery whores.
- Damn weather!
- There!
We'll get soaked.
- That one's open!
- ln that tomb?
!
"Dead men don't bite, only live ones do."
Do you want to get hit?
It wouldn't be the first time.
- But you won't.
- Won't I?
No.
Do you think I'll like it?
I'm gonna try...
"Keep going, Gerard."
Who are you?
I can't see very well.
Shall I read for you?
I'm a cop.
Pardon?
How can I help you?
This fabric isn't so fire resistant.
They're my family.
My blood.
We have to practice thoroughly before the performance.
One tiny mistake leads to a break in the neck and...
She's my eldest daughter.
The kid is my youngest.
My son is on the top.
And the one below is my son-in-law.
Son-in-law?
What can I do to help you?
"From now on, just answer yes or no."
"No explanations, no short answers, no multiple choices."
"Hasn't been that long since this circus opened, right?"
Early this month it...
Answer yes or no.
No.
"It hasn't been long, I see."
So about 4 weeks?
"Well, not that long."
Yes or no!
No.
- About 3 weeks?
- No.
- 2 weeks?
- No.
Just walk out from us?
He did all my homework.
Sit down.
So you did it?
I see you missed out on your education.
"""We walk""."
Walk doesn't take an 's' in the plural.
"Page 24, ""The blazing sun ripens the wheat."""
"Let me explain, Sir."
I'd like to explain to you.
What's the subject?
Wheat is the subject in this sentence!
Wheat is the subject and the subject is wheat!
So Napoleon said: 'Let my white panache be your rallying point'?
!
"Well, I did get my leaving certificate."
Stay right where you are.
Here?
There!
Open your books.
It's time for dictation.
- What are you doing?
- It's in my book!
Go and sit down.
Get back to your desk!
What's wrong with your book?
Don't panic!
Get back into class!
Time's almost up!
You can go home now.
You stay here.
I'd like a word with you.
I might know more than you.
That's why I'm not afraid.
Hold up.
I've met other people who talk like you.
They don't have anyone in their lives to care about.
Are you one of those people?
I think your diagnosis has gone too far now.
Being called out nosy is actually quite harsh.
I didn't mean it like that.
Okay.
It's a doctor's duty to never turn a patient away.
So I got to continue treating you.
Sorry for wasting your time.
"You still have the medicine, right?"
Here.
"Next time if you want to change doctors, you can."
Just inform them at the counter.
Never felt lonely.
"Because I have me, myself to care."
"Damn, so music video of you."
Up yours.
What's wrong?
Are you sick?
No.
You sure?
You want to see a doctor?
Damn.
To say sorry
I have to wait another month.
Yoon.
Yoon.
Yoon.
is he putting any food on the table?
We've got to help each other.
"We got to be really, really careful while we do it."
"I don't want to hear a word about her anymore, Henry."
Never.
-Daddy!
We missed you.
-Are you here to stay?
Did you see our pictures?
I did the one with the house and rainbow.
I did the sun.
My chorus concert is in two weeks.
Are you coming?
Do you like the house?
"-Karen, get packed."
We're moving out of here.
-With what?
Don't worry with what.
"Just start looking for a new house, ok."
I got to go to Pittsburgh in the morning.
"Those guys up there owe me $15,000."
We'll be alright. I got things lined up.
Pittsburgh?
You have to go see your parole officer tomorrow.
"Karen, don't worry about it."
Everything's gonna be fine.
Who wants to go to Uncle Paulie's?
What do you want?
"Sweetheart, let Mommy eat."
You look good.
Did you eat this good in the joint?
I don't want any more of that shit.
-Bail reports.
-Thanks.
Bull.
Right on time.
And in perfect order.
Billie. look how neat that is.
Yeah.
I didn't drool on it or anything.
Look.
Bull.
I'm sorry about what happened in the cafeteria.
It doesn't bother me that you laughed at my rhyme scheme.
You laughed at me.
Oh. come on.
Bull. that isn't you.
You never missed the boat of life.
Besides. there is no boat of life.
It's called a metaphor.
Harry.
A literary device used to illustrate dissatisfaction with my current status in the cosmos.
-Come again?
-My life is poo-poo.
Bull. we all feel like that from time to time. right?
I mean. everyone wants more out of life.
It seems to me like you've got it already.
You're a judge.
You stand for justice.
You're a public defender.
You stand for the underprivileged.
I'm a bailiff.
I stand.
Kind of like cattle.
And then you tripled them.
"Well, yeah, I guess I was overdoing it a bit."
I wanna do something fun.
I'm gonna take Quinn out of school tomorrow.
Douglas Park.
We ain't been there in years.
Uh...
"Yeah, about tomorrow..."
Um...
My man died.
Leonard died.
- This past Monday we lost him.
- What are you talking about?
You were in transit.
I had no way of contacting you.
"- When I left, he was in the hospital."
- I know.
Leonard died?
His funeral is tomorrow.
I thought he was gonna make it.
Come on.
"Yeah, I don't feel right."
I can't.
"You're getting out of this car, and you're gonna pay your respects to his family."
- I can't.
I'm gonna stay here.
- He was your commanding officer.
He was our country's hero.
He was like a son to me.
You owe it to all of us.
You got five minutes to get your act together and get out of this car.
"You hear me, sergeant?"
Okay.
Forget I said it.
"-Say, Josiah."
-Yep.
Have you ever thought about marriage?
"Well, animals mate."
"Plants grow, flowers bloom."
Seems to be the natural order of things.
Maybe that's it. lt ought to be natural.
Right?
It's not something that's forced on you.
JOSlAH:
Exactly.
Then again...
... couldbethefates sending you a blessing.
BUCK:
Yeah?
Fine wife.
The life of a child.
Most men would live and die for that.
Yeah.
"Well, tell me this."
How do I know that Lucy is the one for me?
"I mean, I hardly know her."
Seems to me that would be a good starting point. lf you want it.
"Well, what do you mean?"
Get to know the girl.
Circled back two miles.
Looks like they gave up on us.
Probably fixing to break camp and get the hell out of here.
"If they're smart, that's what they'll do."
He ain't getting away this time.
- Shut up?
How long you been waiting to say that to me?
You two.
I need an explanation that doesn't involve my dad coming back from the dead.
_
_
_
What is that?
What language is that?
What are you saying?
!
Don't even bother.
It's some twin thing.
"It freaks me out, too."
[Stammering] That's what freaks you out?
!
"Hey, get your panties out of a twist, take a deep breath, and admit you know who I am, kiddo!"
- Don't call me that!
- Don't call me that!
"Now, you hate being called kiddo 'cause you're a grown man."
You took care of the family when I wasn't around.
"That's right, isn't it, kiddo?"
It's a mind-bender.
I know.
Imagine how I felt.
No.
No.
- Don't backslide.
Stay with it.
"- No, no, no, no!"
I know this is a lot to take in.
No.
What a catastrophe...
Didn't you find her?
Yes.
Amelia.
The husband tried to throw us down the stairs!
She was completely fat!
They say us singers end up fat.
I'm sure you won't.
Laura says hi.
How is she?
-Fine.
She's still my guardian angel.
Always worried about me.
She asked me how were you doing.
And what was your answer?
That you look so great!
And what do you think?
I think you have a normal look.
"A moment ago, I was thinking how would you look without beard."
Taxi!
Luisa!
Make him come to the concert!
"Hey Max, if you don't come, let's not wait another 10 years huh?"
"Do you like singing, right?"
Yes.
It's what a like the most.
And do you like that song you sang before?
I know that poem is yours.
It'd be better to say it was.
I wrote it more than 20 years ago.
How were you like back then?
Without beard.
Do you feel older?
Yes.
So when is your tour starting?
"You know, we actually just had to push it another month."
Our tour manager totally screwed it up.
She got the dates wrong.
"Actually, Cece, who I think you've met."
Oh.
The blonde.
"Yeah, the blonde."
"At the park, and at the show."
Right.
"You... you had a thing with her, right?"
No.
"No, no."
She works with me.
"She's my tour manager, and not into guys."
But what makes you think that I was into her?
The fact that I'm now officially an idiot.
His lesbian tour manager?
Oh.
What's this?
It's a birthday present.
It'll bring you luck.
And I thought you could use a little bit.
Thank you.
It's beautiful.
You're welcome.
"You're not mad at me, are you?"
No.
"No, it's actually just the opposite."
And that's the problem.
Later I find out it's not.
I've been conned.
- What are my options?
"- Just drop it, right?"
- I'd say so too.
- Aren't there any legal measures?
- I'll look into it.
- I'll treat you to dinner.
Oysters?
- Oysters are just fine.
Call me.
- This weekend.
Mia's got a bag.
- Mia hasn't got a bag of oysters.
- I didn't buy them.
- You get them in a basket.
- You don't catch them in a basket.
"No, but you sell oysters in a basket and clams in a net."
You're confusing them with shrimp.
Way to go!
- Good morning.
"- My, fresh rolls and everything."
- Thanks for a great night.
"- Well, thank you."
You were great.
"It was mind-blowing, Frank."
"- Yes, I performed my magic."
- I've never felt anything like it.
"When you told me flat out, I was hurt, I have to admit."
- But Casper knew this little trick.
- You talked to Casper about it?
Yes.
"18 year old girl, like a rose."
"Boy at 18, nothing to boast;"
"Woman at 40, beauty most,"
"Man at 40, what a ghost."
"Woman at 80, sparkles and glows!"
"Man at 80, coffin soon to close."
What's your rank?
"Supermac 99, and yours?"
Supermac 98!
You've been found out.
You're done!
What shall I do?
"Only the Commissioner's fiancee, who can save you."
But I don't want to see her again.
This is an order.
Go immediately!
Why are you here?
You remember what you said to me yesterday?
I don't remember.
But I do. I remember it too well.
You said you'll never see me again.
I was just joking.
I don't mean what I say.
"But you said you love me, do you mean it?"
Of course I do.
I need you help.
My help?
To go after some girl?
Can't you even get Dumplings on your own?
All I want is to get the 'Beast'.
But Hiroshima has escaped and identified me.
I was told that only you can help me out.
I have to get him.
I have to get him.
- No!
Let me go!
I have to get him!
I'll drag him down to hell with me!
I'll drag him down to hell with drums and trumpets!
"The world can go to the dogs, every single man and woman!"
We're all going to hell with drums and trumpets!
You can't go out there!
We're all going to hell!
You're coming to the station.
You're Biberkopf!
We're all going to hell!
Don't ever come back here again!
REWARD!
MURDER IN FREIENWALDE
"Listen, wanna make some money?"
A pile of dough.
- How?
See what it says?
"""Blond hair."""
Still don't get it?
Sure.
But won't that get you in trouble?
Nah.
You just say you saw them together in the car.
Near my place around 9:00.
"No, make it 11:00."
COURT OF JUSTICE
Fifteen years' prison for Reinhold.
Pretty stiff.
I told you he was guilty.
Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?
"Oh, Slink, I hope he's okay."
"Oh, a survivor."
Where's the rebel base?
Talk!
I can see your will is strong.
"Well, we have ways of making you talk."
Where are your rebel friends now?
"Sid, your Pop Tarts are ready!"
All right!
Are you all right?
"I'm proud of you, Sheriff."
A lesser man would've talked under such torture.
I sure hope this isn't permanent.
Still no word from Star Command.
We're not that far from the space port.
The door.
It's open!
We're free!
"Woody, we don't know what's out there!"
I'll tell you wha...
"They're gonna eat us, Buzz!"
Do something quick!
Shield your eyes.
It's not working.
I recharged it before I left.
It should be good for...
You idiot!
You're a toy!
Use your karate chop action!
-Get away!
We're not the same breed.
Definitely not.
"I kind of like you, though..."
I know.
Me too.
I feel like getting closer to you.
Too bad I'm in a hurry.
I coulïve invited you to lunch.
You little bastard!
Isn't it nice here?
When no one bugs us we're content with simple pleasures.
"Just like flies, always buzzing around our balls."
Like we're indispensable.
Everything falls apart without us.
Don't go so fast!
My balls hurt!
Then stand up!
I win the prize!
Stupid ass...
Damn!
What a dumb way to get caught...
He's still thirsty.
Don't go away!
Give little Jesus a drink.
Here.
Take it and give him a drink.
Why?
I don't want your money.
Come on...
Don't give us a hard time...
Your tits really turn me on.
I'm meeting my husband.
"You're a loyal citizen of Germany, and I can respect that."
Sometimes I just don't know when to stop doing my job.
Thank you.
I wanted to ask...
How are they?
Ollie and Billy.
Oliver was killed last year in action.
- I'm sorry.
- And Billy...
William now...
He's missing in the Pacific.
I hope he will come back to you soon.
"I'm sure your father wants the same thing, Klaus, and I wish I could give it to him."
"But that's not the game, is it?"
"No, it isn't."
Thank you.
For your kindness.
It's the least I could do.
Maybe we can talk again.
Maybe.
- Soldiers are safe for now.
- That's great.
The Germans searched the Abbey last night.
They didn't find them.
We shouldn't leave them there too long.
We're gonna need a new camp.
Somewhere we can bring them longer term.
- Yeah.
- Varges is close to here.
Varges?
"Yeah, we talked about it."
Might be a good place to recruit more locals for the POWs to train.
"I want you... to stop what you're doing, and leave this village quietly."
I mean it.
Leave.
Quietly.
This is Gokseong.
My turf.
Don't mess around and get yourself killed.
Just leave.
"If you don't leave, you'll die."
"If you heard me, say something."
Or at least nod your fucking head!
Please answer.
"So, you're..."
"Shut up, bitch!"
You're blowing me off?
"Oh, I'm just not worth answering."
Is that it?
"You're not even gonna listen, right?"
Ain't that right?
"I'm trying to speak to you, but you're not listening!"
What's this?
What the fuck is this?
What the hell is all this?
What the...
What the fuck are these rituals you're doing?
!
What the fuck are you doing in my town!
Do you know whose daughter you're messing with?
Son of a bitch!
Look out!
Jong-gu?
Now what?
One breakfast like this could end all the day worries.
What an easy remedy.
As simple as making it everyday.
You'll have to come and make it.
I'll do it for a reasonable price.
Where will you say you stayed the night?
What is the matter?
Will you lie?
Nobody will ask me.
Where did you meet mom?
At college.
And had you met other girls before?
Yes.
Specially one.
What was her name?
Why do you care?
"Come on, tell me."
If you tell me about your writings.
That's blackmail.
Then I'm not telling you her name.
Her name was Amelia.
Was she pretty?
No.
"But she told me that she liked me, and that she was feeling good with me."
Are you and mom still arguing?
Much less now.
Poor Clara...
"Why do you say ""poor Clara""?"
-It's just a manner of speaking.
She says the same about you.
Is that right?
You're sad.
Anyway...
All the comforts.
- Can I have a look?
- Yes.
Do you know the area?
- Is the house yours?
- I wish.
We have fans available if you need them.
- Whose house is it?
- The owner lives in Valencia.
"She hasn't come in years, she's very old..."
- Who rented it last?
- I don't remember.
It's been closed for a long time.
It's the off season.
I was here yesterday and I saw three people enter the house.
"Nice, very pretty."
You're hurting me!
I asked you a question.
Who was here yesterday?
I don't know who rents it.
You rent it and you don't know to who?
I rent it to him by the day.
He calls me right before and puts the money in an account.
Lower your voice.
Who's the man in the hat?
Who is he?
I don't know anything.
I get paid not to meddle.
What are you doing?
What's going on here?
Nothing.
Understood?
"- Yeah, understood."
- Ok.
- This is ridiculous.
"- You, thank you very much for coming."
- Come anytime you want.
"- I will, I promise."
I promise.
Can I ride on the rig with you guys?
"Hey, chief, can the kid ride in the rig?"
"Sure, go ahead."
"Bobby, you ride with me."
Why do I got to ride in the suburban?
'Cause I said so.
"Come on, you big mutant."
I thought you were going over in that thing.
"No, I'm riding in the rig."
The chief said it's ok.
"Ok.Well, keep your hands to yourself, don't touch anything hot."
"If your kid's in trouble, I'm not looking out for him."
"He gets in trouble, mike's gonna watch after him."
"Oh, really?"
I guess he's in trouble already.
"Oh, whoa."
What the hell is this?
"Did you ok this, chief?"
It's ok.
Don't worry about it.
- I love you.
"- Love you, too."
"Hey, check out salt and pepper over there."
Wouldn't mind those two on a sandwich.
"Please, let me go!"
I can't stay here.
They told me to stick with him at all times!
Who?
The president of Yong Moon Plan...
I have to listen to him!
"Please, let me..."
You have to hide out somewhere that no one can find you!
"What bastard, in his right mind, stays home after stabbing a man?"
This is his house.
Stay here until things quiet down.
You...
- You can't call my mom.
- I don't even know her number.
I only stabbed him once...
Only once.
Do you think he died?
"What do I do now, Han Gyul?"
"Hey, how long will he be here?"
Suck it up...
You little...
Your phone.
You better never record me again.
Your voice recorder.
I gave that to the police at the station...
"Oh, is this it?"
The three million won you owe me?
Yes.
"Since you paid me back, aren't we done talking?"
Representative...
I'm a little scared.
Of what?
Freddie's got a brother from Oxford.
They want another girl to make it a quartet.
He's a bit of all right too.
And we're going to the Empire.
- The Empire?
- Yes.
"Oh, it's ever so gay there, lvy and the show is grand."
It's just where all the toffs go.
"- No, I don't think so, Marcia."
- Why not?
I just don't feel like it.
That's all.
"You ain't afraid to go, are you?"
Afraid?
- Why should I be afraid?
"- Oh, I don't know."
I just thought...
"Well, I ain't afraid of nobody."
"But you ain't been out for ever so long, have you?"
"- No, but..."
"- He ain't your lord and master, is he?"
I should say he ain't.
Or is it because you ain't got a nice enough dress?
Of course I have.
"What are you standing there for, then?"
Go and put it on.
All right.
What's that across your back?
What?
There's nothing.
Did he do that to you?
- Let me see.
- Would you use it?
Of course.
If necessary.
Jo asked me to say good night to Daddy for him.
He loves you very much.
I love him.
"But, darling, you don't show it."
You never tell him.
You never hold him.
Don't be afraid now that he's growing up.
Afraid of what?
What the hell have I got to be afraid of?
"I'm going to go for walks with him, aren't I?"
And swim with him and play football with him.
- David...
"- I want him to be proud of me, don't I?"
"To grow up like his father, a legless fucking joke."
I suppose you and your mother had a lovely time discussing me.
She's very concerned about you.
I don't need anyone's concern.
I can manage alone.
I can't.
"David, I need you."
- I love you.
- Don't.
"Please, don't."
I want to sleep.
"For God's sake, let me sleep."
Thank you.
You haven't let this room to anybody since the death of Mrs Garden?
"No, sir."
Not since Billy Parkin lived here.
Where's your dad...?
...He wasn't... my dad...
What this stuff?
I like puzzles.
I'm wanna go home now...
I wanna go.
Are you gonna let me...?
What are you gonna do to me...?
...I told you we couldn't be friends...
Hi...
Are you Larry...?
can I talk to you for a minute...?
Sure.
Sorry to bother you.
..How's... she doing...?
It's been... quite a night
They had to give her almost six pints of blood...
We're still waiting to see if her body rejects it.
I won't keep you too long.
I just want...
I need to ask you about the description you gave.
Of the little girl.
"You said she had long blonde hair was around twelve years old, and wasn't wearing shoes..."
- Right?
- Right!
Have you ever seen this man?
He's a suspect in a murder investigation.
Maybe...
Looks like a guy in our building
Did he have a daughter?
Like the girl you described?
I don't know.
What are you gonna do?
Let me think!
I gotta think.
Who else has a cell phone?
Um...turn 'em off and slide 'em over to me.
"- Ray, it's in my coat."
- Go ahead.
"- What happens now, Ray?"
- I'm thinking.
"There's no time, Ray."
Charlie doesn't have that kind of time.
Okay...
I want you to call the FBI.
You know which one of these is yours?
The little flip phone.
This one?
What should I tell them?
"The FBI, Ray."
What should I tell them?
"Um...tell 'em I'm armed, and I'm gonna have to start shooting people if my demands aren't met."
"Oh, God."
We're gonna die.
We're gonna die.
Just shut up!
I'm only gonna shoot you if they don't do what I'm asking them.
- Ray?
- What?
What demands?
What are you asking them to do?
"Tell 'em I wanna talk to the person in charge of their, um... you know, whatever they call it, their--their extraterrestrial project."
You want Will Smith or Tommy Lee Jones?
"Cynthia, you're not helping."
"I don't know, kid."
I'm too old for you.
I'm 31.
How old are you?
Almost 17.
"Means when I'm 21, you'll be almost 36."
That ain't so bad.
"- Edgar, I have to pee."
- God!
"How are you back there, Tillie?"
"- Hey, I'm pulling."
You talk.
- It hurts too much.
You talk.
It's hard for me.
I haven't had a lot of practice at it.
"When I was a kid up in Michigan, we'd go hunting."
For three days we'd not say ten words to each other.
Everybody just does what has to be done.
- Never told you about my first instructor.
- No.
His name's Sloaniger.
"God, he could talk."
"He'd yell at me, scare me to death."
"I was all thumbs for a while, the way you are."
"Dammit, he stuck with me."
"You know, he finally sent me off soloing."
I cried.
It's true.
"Before, I never felt I belonged anywhere and my parents didn't bother with me."
I kinda grew up all over the place.
That day I was up there by myself and I was just... weaving through clouds and...
"No, he wasn't there."
He really was a bus driver.
It looks like he got sick and quit about a week ago.
And what is he doing now?
I don't know.
"If he's sick, where could he have gone?"
You look sick too.
You should go home and get some rest.
I'll take you.
"I'm not going to go home, I'm going to see my mother."
"Well, I'll take you there."
Pull yourself together.
Let's go.
No one's here.
Woman Come in.
Where's my mother?
She just stepped out.
Is she going home?
"She did say that she'd be going home, yes."
This is a nice studio.
It has your mother's mark on it.
When did I last see her dance?
Hmm...
It must have been just as the Pacific War was starting.
That's right.
"When the war got worse, she stopped dancing in public."
She was dancing with Kayama-sensei.
Your mother's dancing was beautiful!
"You've danced with Kayama-san, too haven't you."
"Yes, many times."
He took me to many ballet performances.
"You can't forget Kayama-sensei, can you?"
I'll come back.
Are you staying?
You haven't seen my colleagues?
No.
Madam.
You left the baby!
I went to fetch you some milk.
You haven't seen my colleagues?
No. I only saw them this morning.
This morning.
And this afternoon?
- Did they have the gear?
"- No, they had nothing."
I've prescribed her some pills.
Give them to her to ease the pain.
We don't have a car to get to the chemist's.
Give her medicine.
There's none left.
What's the matter?
It's her prescription.
Whose?
The invalid's.
The old woman?
I'll fetch it.
Can you drop me off?
"Yes, of course."
Good-bye.
Drive safely.
I'm like a general without an army.
Where do you want to go?
I'm going to the hospital.
Are you worried about your car or about the victim?
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
"Sifu Wong, I propose a toast to your health."
- You're too kind.
- Thank you.
"Cheers, everyone."
I'll help myself.
- It's an honor to know you.
- Don't mention it.
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.
It looks like I blew my chance to be Sifu Wong's student.
Let's get out of here.
We're like brothers.
We'll find a way.
I've got it!
What?
You have to continue with schemes to show your heroism.
I promise this scheme will work better.
I don't want to be a hero.
You've got to appeal to Sifu's compassion.
"Good, that's the look!"
Let's go!
"- Sifu, we're in trouble!"
- What is it?
"A band of robbers was raiding the bank and Mousy was brave, he stood up to them without thought for his own life."
He beat them.
- What happened next?
- It's bad.
He's severely injured.
Were there any police around?
They disappeared when the robbers arrived.

Sonakshi I really liked that you attended the party.
Me too.
"- I mean, you got your ass kicked."
- Why wouldn't you tell me?
I could have taken a dive.
I wouldn't have had to get my ass kicked.
"Mac, it had to look real."
Were you gonna tell me eventually?
- Yes.
- Yeah?
- I was going to tell you eventually.
- Yeah?
You know what?
Stab this son of a bitch.
"Oh, wait a second."
"Oh, come on, Mac."
"Don't be like that, man."
You would have done the same thing.
"Come on, don't act like a baby."
Please don't stab me.
"Bash this ugly jerk's face in, Daddy."
- Your last chance to chicken out.
"- That ain't gonna happen, Bobby."
- I've been waiting for this for a long time.
"- All right, Frankie."
Seeing that we're a couple of old men here...
I think we should lay down some ground rules.
Now.
Number one.
Holy shit!
"Since I was currently homeless,"
Turk and Carla were letting me crash here as long as I needed.
"J.D., you have to get out."
"Then, we can have... fun afterwards."
Let's do that.
"Enough, okay?"
"I'm really sorry, so let's stop."
I'm a bastard.
"No, I'm an asshole, okay?"
I didn't ask you to apologize to me.
Have I ever done this to you before?
You've done wrong today!
What's wrong with you?
Is that the restaurant you mentioned?
"Yes, it is."
Let's go in.
We'll eat and have a drink.
You must be hungry.
You should eat.
"Let's have a drink, okay?"
Let's go.
Let's have some sushi.
- Welcome.
- Hello.
"- We can sit over there, right?"
- Yes.
- There's three of you?
- Yes.
I thought about it as I was walking.
You're too opportunistic.
Why all the fuss?
You nearly brought tears to my eyes.
What about me that's so opportunistic?
"Frankly, it wasn't tears but disgust."
You were just trying to show me that you're a man.
Sent it already.
Turn off the computer.
Turn off the computer.
Turn off the computer.
Turn off the computer.
Turn off the computer.
Damn it.
You shook her hand once.
Now you're all messed up inside.
That's the bravest you've been in 7 years.
The last time you were in bed before 9 was 7th grade.
Lord
Buddha
Lord
Buddha
Lord
Lord
Hold on.
"I have another deadline on Wednesday, right?"
Damn it. 7 hours gone with the wind.
I should have fixed the nail.
Shit!
I'm lying down but can't sleep.
Her nail is still broken.
Forget it.
No one will see it.
"But if you can see it, someone else might too!"
How could you send such crappy work like that?
Shit her nail is broken.
"If you try too hard to sleep, you can't sleep."
"If you want to fall asleep, don't try so hard."
But her nail is broken.
At least I got the one.
Right?
Yeah.
"Get out, get out, get out."
We got a lot of work to do.
"Good, good."
- Ah!
- Mm-hmm.
What are we doing?
"Charlie, you're, like, the toughest guy we know."
- Yeah?
"- So nobody can kick your ass, right?"
- Practically invincible.
- Yeah.
"Yeah, what's your point though?"
Well...
"So here's what's gonna happen, pal."
Dennis and I are gonna train you... to be an underground street fighter.
What?
That is brilliant.
"- Yeah, it is."
"- Okay, what's the first step?"
- First step is getting that shirt off.
"- Yeah, let's get that shirt off."
- Why would I do that?
- That shirt's just gonna weigh you down.
"Yeah, and Rocky never wears a shirt when he trains... so let's just go ahead and rip that bad boy off."
I think I'm gonna wear it.
That's ridiculous.
"You can't train and wear a shirt, dude."
Now it's becoming this whole big thing.
It feels a little gay.
Nothing!
Nothing!
"I tell you I saw them, as clear as I see you now."
The captain's gone completely crazy.
He should be locked up.
He's becoming dangerous.
Everyone seems to know about it.
News travels fast around here.
People are staying indoors.
- There's no way they can know.
- We've said too much.
There's that sailor who saw the girls in the ship cemetery.
"What about Louise, did she see anything?"
Louise?
"Yes, maybe."
She has second sight.
Tragedy is upon the village.
Tonight he will be free!
Who do you mean?
The one who hides in the ruins.
I can see him!
He is waiting
He is calling.
I can see you!
"Open this door, so the devil's fury may be unleashed on this cursed land."
Let the death of us all be the price of your life.
Unleash all the forces of evil upon us!
I will give you the power.
Go on.
That's it!
Now open the door.
Good.
Pardon me.
What are we going to do about this Chummy individual?
We can't allow her to sing.
"The minute she opens her mouth, the ushers will open the doors."
"That's where you're wrong, Chowsky she'll be the biggest laugh in the show."
- But she takes it seriously.
- The audience won't.
Tell her her number's in.
[sighs]
Go on.
"Alright, dearie, let's try it."
Start from the first.
[piano music]

"- Yea, I mind."
Actually...
Do what you like.
It doesn't matter anyway.
I'll take it out to the stairs.
"Oh Violet, you might wanna wipe your prints off those pieces."
Put them back on the fellas.
"Sounds good, Daze."
Come on sit down!
I wanna show you something.
You know you'd probably a millionaire if you clean your ears out more often.
No uh!
Here.
Now what were you going to tell me?
"Yea, the secret."
You were going to tell me.
Can I ask you somethin'?
Why is she so mad at you?
"- She's your friend, you tell me."
- I'm not talking about Violet!
- She blames me for something.
- For what?
- Her mother's death.
"- Why, did you kill her?"
"No, no."
She died after she left me.
- Why did she leave you?
- She didn't love me.
- Why didn't she love you?
"- I don't know, Daisy."
I don't think people have a lot of control over that sort of thing.
"As a husband, I wasn't much a prize anyway."
Yes.
I tracked you down.
I bumped into you in front of your apartment in Paris.
"Pretended it was just, uh, by chance."
We had a really good time in St. Tropez.
You stole my life.
"Look, if it's any consolation, it really wasn't much of a life."
You didn't seem very happy.
Oh.
Blame yourself.
"I mean, I tried to cut you in, but you wouldn't give me your pass code, so I mean, I had to use the drug."
How did I get away from you?
I guess I'm getting old.
Sloppy.
I forgot how physical you could be.
You ran off to tell Jacob.
(speaking German)
Please.
"Oh yeah, I'd be afraid too."
Why are you helping him?
Call it instinct.
You couldn't take that away from me.
"Uh, do you wanna see the girl or not?"
This way.
Stay.
What happened?
"It's under control, thank you."
"Julia, I'm Marta."
I'm a friend of your father's.
Where is he?
He's waiting for you.
Where?
I'd rather make sure the kids are tucked in.
They might have a nightmare and throw the covers off they could get a sore throat.
Wait.
"Give them something, Bruno."
Here...
Is all I have.
"Your wallet, Bruno!"
You punk.
Dirty little bastard!
Whas with this chick?
Just spreads her legs and stares at the ceiling...
Son of a bitch!
What are you complaining about?
"You got off, didn't you?"
Like screwing a piece of meat.
Get up now.
He needs to rest.
Look at this dumb chick!
No panties!
Hurry up.
I'd like to go now...
Don't you like panties?
You going to answer me or not?
Look what your friend did to me.
You should take it easy.
What if I can't get it up again?
"Look, you bitch!"
You're going to be all right...
Is not my fault!
I didn't shoot you!
I don't give a shit about his car.
He your boyfriend?
I don't know why you let him move in.
He's me brother.
You never know when you'll need bone marrow.
"He's rude, he's ignorant, he's lazy."
Yeah.
How could two brothers be so different?
"Anyway, he's gone."
Moved back in with Donna.
"That's the last we'll see of ""The Troyminator""."
"I had to tell you, at that party the other night in the bathroom, I saw..."
- What?
- What?
You was in the bathroom at the party the other night and you saw...
Saw... that it needed a makeover.
So paint it magnolia.
Put some decking' down.
Sort your taps out.
- Eh?
- Just a fuckin' thought!
Gotta go.
See ya.
What's up with you?
Looks like death row in here.
"Er... yeah, well, better get back in the saddle."
That horse'll be on bricks by now.
I'd best bust a move.
I've got to meet Amanda.
- Who?
- Amanda.
"You know, with weird eyes."
See ya!
"Gonna pop out, get some fags."
I should go.
Hang on.
"You might as well stay for the beginning of ""Saved by the Bell"", if you want."
"Okay, how do I look?"
Good.
How do I look?
"- Just be as normal as you can, okay?"
"- Wait, how much did I weigh at birth?"
I don't know.
It was your birth.
"But you should know, shouldn't you?"
"I mean, if you're my dad."
"Listen, she doesn't suspect that we're not father and son."
She's not going to be trying to catch us out.
When's your birthday?
Quick.
- August 19.
- Okay.
Who's my mum?
Your mum's your mum.
"So you were married to my mum, but now you've split up?"
Yeah.
Whatever.
Does it bother you or me?
"No, I'm comfortable with it."
But I think you still have a few issues.
"It's not funny, okay."
- Only cause you're a...
"- You love her still, don't you?"
- Christ's sake.
- I know you do.
- You love Mummy.
What was wrong with the last one?
Nothing.
And the people who bought it quite liked it too.
Really?
Really.
"Oh, for God's sake."
"Yeah, it's down again."
I called Ike.
"You call, I come running!"
"Ooh, OK."
Up and running again.
"Let me guess, he turned it off and turned it back on again."
"(LAUGHS) No, he replaced the router."
Apparently it was shot.
He swears it wasn't an excuse to come and see you.
Uh-huh.
Although I do think it got him here a lot quicker.
Would it be alright if I use the space?
To paint?
Yeah.
Or to hide from Ike?
To paint.
Yeah.
You go for your life.
Maybe I'll put one of yours on the wall and see how you like that.
Maybe.
"You know that Ike is a really lovely guy, don't you?"
And he really has a thing for you which means he's not going away anytime soon.
That's his problem.
Yep.
"But you'll still have to deal with it, right?"
"It's great out here, eh?"
Your date's here.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- It's good seeing you again.
"- You, too."
You didn't tell me you have a kid.
Huh?
Did you tell her you were my kid?
I am.
"What, did you have her when you were five?"
No!
"She's just, you know, a minor residing in my home."
"Hey, I know you."
"No, you don't."
"Yeah, I'm pretty sure."
"I don't know where from, but uh... why are you shaking your head?"
You know I
- I don't think we've met before.
"No, I'm pretty sure we're well-acquainted."
"You know, I think I would remember you."
You're pretty memorable.
Are you the babysitter?
Me?
"No, no I totally tried to fuck Ling before I found out she was seventeen."
"That doesn't sound right, taken out of context."
"Yeah, that doesn't sound right in any context."
-Let's go.
-Yeah.
"Nice meeting you Ling, Bender."
"Hey, how the fuck you know my name?"
Let's go!
The night is young!
"Murat, what happened?"
Don't tell her anything.
She doesn't know...
What the hell happened?
"Don't panic, he is OK."
I fucking fell down.
Tell me the truth.
Was it that little bastard?
"No, I just fell."
God.
Don't embarrass him.
Go back to bed.
OK.
I really am OK.
"Just leave, I got to pee."
"Don't worry, he's all right."
He is not my boyfriend.
He is my shadow.
Where I walk... he walks with me.
He knows what I eat... where I sleep... whom I am with.
Why is he following you?
Because here in Istanbul I have a different life.
"Yo wimp, do you think I didn't spot you the other day, mamma's boy."
That's not fair.
How are you bro?
Are you OK?
Just want you to know that I took care of your money.
It's all settled.
Do you need anything further?
"Off course, he would come back... every time I enjoyed freedom."
Why would he do that?
You should have gone to the police.
-Fill me in here.
What's...
"Okay, so what we're gonna do is I'm gonna go down there,"
"- have a 360 around, just doing a chair check... - ...before I get the hard hat on and suited up."
"Checking out to see if there's any foreign objects, debris that might come down on top of me."
"And then, once-once I've checked her out, top of the water level, um then I'll, come back up and get suited up."
-Okay.
Jump on.
-Fantastic.
Okay.
"-Cool, buddy."
Let's give it a go.
-Yeah.
"Okay, up."
Okay.
Lower down.
- Down slow.
"-That's good now, yeah."
Down four.
Slower four.
"What do you got there, Tony?"
Loose one?
"Yeah, I've got a loose rock here, mate."
"I want to take that out, um, before we go any further."
"It's...if that comes down, it's, it's bad news, man."
Got it.
That could make a good day go bad really fast.
"Okay, I'll take that hard hat back."
-Here you go.
"-Thanks, Mike."
"Take me down probably another two feet, Mike."
Roger.
Of course.
"Believe me, I never kill anyone unless I have to."
Well?
- We need...
- The hospital is surrounded.
Come out with your hands up.
You have 30 seconds.
"After that, we're going to open fire."
Resistance is futile.
I repeat:
Come out with your hands up.
You don't have a chance.
Come out.
"Go, go."
I'll never do what that bastard demands.
Give me a hand grenade.
We might have a chance.
"- Tomás, have you got a smoke bomb?"
- Yes.
Throw it out the door when I give you a sign.
"José, you'll be all right."
They don't know that you're one of us.
- Tell them we took you hostage.
- Thanks for everything you've done.
- Goodbye.
"- Mariá, you can't have a gun battle here."
- Think of the children.
"- They will torture me, if they catch me."
"Tomás, now!"
Let's get out of here.
Fire!
What have you done?
What is that on your face?
It's mu gaze!
What age is it... that you flirt in such way?
- Hello...
- Stop your work!
- Hello!
- I have something for you!
I'm in a meeting.
The signal is not good.
- What meeting?
- Hello...
- The signal is low!
I'll hang up.
- Yawang.
Get in.
I'll drive you home.
Don't tell Mr. Lin that I go with Mr. Qu!
Not you!
Why do I have to get in your car?
"Just take it, or I'll stop the work!"
Don't you think the workers will be so pitiful?
Hi girl!
Do you want to have some coffee?
Let's go for dinner.
No!
My parents are waiting at home.
"Being home right after work, is so boring!"
"Since you are in hurry, we will go back faster!"
Are you insane?
Why are you speeding up?
Don't you like excitement?
Stop the car!
It's already there?
Let me ask you one thing.
What is your true form?
What do you think is my true form?
The devil.
You're the devil.
Why can't you answer?
You've already said it.
I'm the devil.
Shaman
I'm almost there.
Where are you?
Are you home?
I'm with the woman now.
You mustn't let her tempt you.
Never.
"Whatever she tells you, you must go to your daughter now."
Do you understand me?
Understand?
Do you?
Is that your shaman?
Don't believe what he tells you.
They're in on it together.
Isn't that right?
You're already certain I'm the devil.
That's why you came here... carrying that sickle.
"My words, whatever I say- they won't change your mind."
No.
That's not true.
There's no doubt.
You came here to confirm your suspicions about me.
That's not true!
She's smart.
I was a little protective of her when we first got here.
I just wasn't sure how she was gonna deal with your scene.
I think she's dealing just fine with my scene.
I think she likes it.
"Obviously, she's getting stoned with you..."
-...and she's reading Spin.
-I don't read Spin.
I've never read Spin.
She found her own way into the studio.
It had nothing to do with me.
Yeah.
"It's always like that with you, isn't it?"
They....
They always just happen to find their way in.
What's that supposed to mean?
"It means you're charmed, that's all."
Someone's looking out for you.
Nobody's looking out for you?
I'm sorry.
Come on.
Your life looks good from my perspective.
-I've worked for what I have.
-And I haven't?
-You are so stuck on the negative.
-I'm not.
"Yes, you are."
-You've blocked out all the fun we had.
-I haven't blocked it out.
It's all filed.
What about the trip to Veracruz?
Yeah.
It took some time.
Will she be OK?
I don't know.
Her heart's gonna be weak for a while.
"Maybe forever,"
I don't know.
You know Dr. Jerry Gordon is the guy for you.
You do know that?
Thanks for your help.
- I couldn't get in.
- It happens.
And Dallas.
Exciting.
Big trauma centre...
Congrats.
That's great.
"You don't mean that, do you Jerry?"
Sure I do.
I'm thrilled you're gonna be thousands of miles away.
Doc?
- I didn't touch the guy.
"- No, that bruising around his neck just appeared like magic."
"What was it, a choke hold before you put him in the car, or after?"
"I wouldn't make accusations like that, Doc."
I'll do whatever I want.
He almost died.
Which would have been a real tragedy.
We still need to talk to Mr. Pike.
"He's going to be a little busy, what with the CT scans and the trip to ICU."
"Well, we'll just wait."
There it is.
Casa Natasha.
"And one and two and three, twist."
"A one, two, three."
"Onto the floor, class."
Down you go.
Onto your elbows.
Single leg lift.
Right leg first.
Left leg bent.
Here we go.
And up.
Down.
Up.
Two more.
Get ready to change.
Left leg.
Hold those tummies in.
Enid!
Single leg lift!
"Oh, sorry."
"So, Tubby."
Is he very sad?
What?
What did he look like when you saw him?
He looked like someone finishing off a pasty.
"For frig's sake, Enid, if there's any havoc caused, you've caused it."
Dithering and faffing about.
You never sort anything out!
"And everyone's favourite, the bicycle."
"Summer will come, let's get ready for those bikinis!"
# I am clear on the fear that has led up to where I am now
# Ie feeble and foolish and fed up and lost as to how
"# I can move from the safe and the timid, the fearful, the tepid"
Where are you guys going?
Don't you want to play anymore?
Was it something I said?
Sheesh.
"I know you're not counting cards, because I spot cheaters for a living."
So how do you do it?
Ever hear of just being good?
I make it a daily practice.
- I practice being the best.
- At cards?
And other things.
"Well, you'll have to tell me about it, someplace I can hear you."
I have a room.
I have a suite.
You win.
Watch those.
She's in.
Nice pad for a cruise line employee.
I'm an independent contractor.
Better perks.
"Now, where were we?"
You move fast.
- Life's short.
- I have a feeling...
I'm not the first girl you've brought to your suite.
Why waste the night talking about other women?
I like you.
I like champagne.
I'm gonna go freshen up.
Be my guest.
I caught you...
Putting on lipstick.
Okay.
"He needs extra oxygen, he's gonna have to spend the night."
"Okay, that will be fine."
"Then, we'll hold off on the film for now, but if he gets any worse... ."
He gets x-rayed.
He says he didn't do it.
"D, I don't like this any better than you do, man."
He wouldn't lie.
"Come on, man."
Did he lie about the tagging?
Or the weed they found in his pocket?
"Look, K.J.'s a good kid, but right now, his judgment basically sucks."
I wanna talk to this Doctor... .
-Dubenko.
"-Yeah, the security guard too."
"D, they don't wanna press charges, man."
"But they're accusing my kid, I just wanna talk to them."
Banana bag is finished and she took a few ice chips.
Who are you?
I'm Dr. Lockhart.
You're at County General.
"Let's see if you can sit up on your own, okay?"
She should be sobering up by now.
"Glenda, can you squeeze my hand?"
Let's see.
Try and squeeze my hand.
Squeeze my hand.
Come on.
Okay.
Can you open your eyes?
"Glenda, come on."
Good.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Surprised to see your pal Greg here.
Surprised to see your pal Greg here.
"He's undercutting us,"
"He's undercutting us, using our bloody network to sell his bloody gear."
using our bloody network to sell his bloody gear.
"Me, I'd set an example."
"Me, I'd set an example."
Prove to me you're not just another Kiwi wanker.
Prove to me you're not just another Kiwi wanker.
How you doing?
Fine.
How you doing?
Fine.
(SCOFFS) What's with you?
(SCOFFS) What's with you?
Greg.
Greg?
Greg.
Greg?
You know what he calls you - a poser.
You know what he calls you - a poser.
How can you be mates with him?
How can you be mates with him?
TERRY:
It's obvious you're not happy.
TERRY:
It's obvious you're not happy.
GREG:
"Mate, I'm as happy as a pig in shit."
GREG:
I am a parrot of the sea.
A puffin that is no longer the sea.
Do not.
"-Bravo, Loving brought us a strange bird, and told us it was a penguin."
Bravo.
"Thanks, I deserved."
"Sorry people, I'm sorry."
But when I lost my hometown.
I was very lonely and very scared.
"Then I met you, and you believed in me."
Sven ...
It was so good have a family.
Thank you.
And that goes up to heaven.
"Folks, let's try this."
"Come on, everybody together."
Fuck you!
[screams] [groans in pain]
You know now?
"Dad, listen to me."
"Dad, give me a second, would you?"
Please!
I'm doing it all now because you're not focused.
My guys have Angel.
There's nothing to worry about there.
You got to focus.
You have to focus!
He cut my face.
What the fuck you want me to do?
"You're standing in front of a mirror, aren't ya?"
"You didn't have to come here, Dad."
I can take care of this.
Enjoying yourself?
Don't be stupid.
This is work.
So flirting with girls is part of your job?
Seeing you grinning makes me want to puke.
Are you getting jealous?
You must be joking.
"Well, cut it out."
"You'll eat, right?"
"Hey, aren't you going to take my order?"
Leave it to me.
"Fine, then."
Reminds me of when we met.
"Just like now, you were quietly eating the kimchi meatloaf I made."
Was I?
Yeah.
You ate it and told me it was like your mom's cooking.
"Oh, I remember."
"You cook so well, I'm sure your restaurant will do well."
So good luck.
But not Korean food.
What?
My restaurant... will serve soba and sake.
You can make soba?
It'll take time.
So you'll have to work extra hard.
Hena.
Are we... breaking up?
Don't talk about that.
"Yeah, this really is good."
Your meatloaf really is the best.
Want some?
"Legs, up to here!"
I'll think about it.
"Good, don't take so long!"
I've got to drink something.
Why are you coming here?
I walk around the whole day  and think about how I could live.
I come back here and wait...
"Mainly, I've been waiting on you, my dear."
You've really downsized quite a bit.
My father started all that.
I've told someone about you.
Could you imagine living here with us?
He'd like to take a look at the hotel.
Why?
He could do a lot more for you.
Why are you coming here?
You leave everything open.
"Very nice, without any obligations."
We have the ability to speak.
What is it that you do all day?
What do I do?
But you're still staying?
I'm still staying.
It's so silent here.
No singing.
Where is Emilia?
She's taking a walk.
What?
It's one in the morning.
I have no idea.
Perhaps she's singing outside now.
What do you do before you come here?
We have a warrant to search the premises.
Thank you.
Hi.
Thank you for meeting me.
I didn't know I had a choice.
I want to take you somewhere.
"You know, you can't just take me out of class because you decided to just take a stab at being a mother today."
"You know, like, I could have tests and stuff."
Do you have a test today?
- No.
- Okay.
"Well, then, come on."
Come in!
Christ.
Did I order you?
No.
Mary did.
She hired me to help make sure that you stay clean.
Said you had somewhere to be later.
"I-I don't know if I'm hallucinating or dying, but either way, I like the view."
"Hello, Angel."
It's Annie.
And you look exactly like I thought you would.
Dashing.
Depraved.
"Okay, that's enough standing."
Come on.
"Now, sit."
Stay.
Drink this.
It's a protein shake.
I don't want it.
"Or did your father send you to detain us, while he flees to Russia?"
- Ha ha!
It was a joke!
Put that thing away!
Where is my father?
I could go take a look.
It's best if we all go together.
"No, we're all staying here!"
I've been preparing this evening for weeks.
"- I won't allow you to ruin my event, just because you've gone crazy."
- What do you want?
Just tell me exactly what it is!
What?
Yes!
What!
?
To go to Sweden.
To Sweden?
He wants to go to Sweden.
Why didn't you say that earlier?
Give Bulle a call.
He drives up there tonight.
He could pick him up.
"And get Angie, she can take over from here."
You will allow me to let someone take over.
I have to take care of my bar.
Tell me...
Couldn't we break off the pieces and move them?
We can't.
That's how the world champions would do it.
Fine then.
The knight goes from G5 to E6.
Where have I been?
I've been trying to get here!
"Look, we'll never be able to find her."
If...
"If I walk over there, she's gonna walk over here."
"If I'm on this side, she's probably gonna be on that side!"
"All right, panicking's not gonna help, Shane."
"Hey, want to dance, tough guy?"
"No, I'd step on your feet, I'd hurt you."
"Thank you, though."
"All right, now, everybody up, everybody up!"
This is Eden East!
This place is amazing!
I can't believe they kept this from us!
I knew you would love it.
This is why I brought you here.
Vitality!
"Oh, it is so nice to be out with lots of people!"
Everyone's smiling and laughing.
Don't you guys love this?
It's great.
"In a couple more minutes, I'll just roofie myself."
"I will go get my special Salvadore drink, yes?"
"Oh, yes."
"""Guess I am on my way."""
"""Mighty glad you stayed!"""
Yes!
Yes!
He is so much fun!
"Oh, God, don't even start."
I'm just having fun.
"No, it's just..."
Take a look over there.
They're having all this light come right through that.
Do you have to go now?
"Can you come back, or no?"
"- No, no, I'm going to go."
"- Okay, well, did you know why"
I came to see you today?
"Well, I'm making a film about Lou."
"- Well, I knew that."
- You knew that.
- I knew that.
- But...
I'm Lou's son.
God.
I saw you when you were six years old.
I saw you at the wake.
I saw you with your mother.
You remember that day?
What a crazy world.
You are Lou.
Have a nice concert.
- Where's Nathaniel?
- Why'd you get so upset?
"Gosh, you love a man..."
"and I knew Lou had a son, and I was told never to tell that Lou had a son."
I don't know.
"Lou was... didn't talk about his family much, except about his daughter."
He didn't talk about that.
Men don't talk about those things.
"That was his, that was his very personal thing."
We all have those personal things.
Thanks.
I did not say anything.
"No, we are not allowed to say."
He said not to talk assignment.
Thi What did he say?
"No, no ..."
Nonsense!
I do not believe it.
- To think about how to get out of here ..
- Thi-thin mouth!
Damn.
He told me to ...
I can not do what I asked.
You must stop this.
"No, no, please!"
"- Room, microphone ..."
Move!
- Are you sick!
If you do not see us or hear us ...
This will end the game.
Do not trust anyone but yourself.
"Sitting or hit you, you fool!"
Duties ...
I can not do.
You know what to say to me?
To kill anyone when you ask me.
Do not you understand?
"Do not want to kill us, want to punish us"
Do you think it will be a loved membiarakan If you follow the rules?
- Are you an idiot Dave.
- Are you crazy?
We can not do anything with it.
We must do what we were told.
"Hey, mi amor!"
"When you're finished playing with the kids, come play with me."
Where is the car?
I got a guy tuning her up in Yonkers.
Going out to the track next weekend.
I'm ready for Le Mans.
You ready to come with me?
Take a chance?
- I can't leave the kid by himself.
"- Excuses, excuses."
You're just fooling around with that register.
"- I have to pay you back, right?"
- That's right.
Good morning!
"The light, Mag."
I'm trying to finish this.
"- Good morning to you, too."
"- Hey, hey, muñeca."
Buen día.
What is it with these space chicks and the hugest tetas I've ever seen in my life?
What happened to the eggs?
The eggs I asked you to bring home last night?
Those eggs?
- I guess they're at the bodega.
- I guess so.
Why don't we go out for breakfast?
We haven't done that in a month.
- I've got to work.
- I thought you were hungry.
"I am, but-- hey, why don't you get the eggs?"
I've got to pick up beads for the dress.
You can't do me a favor?
"Okay, I'm coming."
I'm...
Here I am.
I'm coming.
I'm coming.
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
I'm here.
And the reason I chose my mother as the hero of this college essay?
She faces her battles every day even though she may never win the war.
She's helped me see... that I didn't cause her disease.
I can't control it.
And I can't cure it.
This is my mom.
And that is her story.
And now...
I'm ready to leave home... and claim my own.

Allison.
- Sorry.
What?
- We have to get your mom something.
She doesn't care about stuff like that.
She's just dying to meet you.
They both are.
"In the Midwest, you don't go to a person's house, let alone your girlfriend's parents', without bringing something."
That's S.L.
Hello.
"Yes, I'm Babette."
So are we going?
Are we staying?
"No, we have to go."
"Fine, okay."
Good.
If you're looking for me.
I'll be here.
Bye.
Where did you pick up the little one?
Blonde angel.
She just appeared.
How come that doesn't happen to me?
You are too pretty.
Should I make myself ugly or what?
Disguise yourself.
Take a look at this.
You know what this looked like before?
No idea.
I do.
What do we do now?
Do you want me to retrieve the file?
"If you ask me, It was a Halloween prank by a couple of kids from the tattoo shop."
"From earth, the sun and the moon appear to be the same size."
Is it coincidental or physical necessity?
This is good.
"So tell me, what kind of quiz show is this?"
Sauerbruch...
Who would be interested in that?
I don't want to discuss it with you now.
-I'm sorry sister.
-It's okay now.
Why are you soaked in rain?
Will you change your clothes!
They said Migs is not in their house.
I also called Ara but he isn't there either.
Where could he be?
I don't want to think he's with Bela.
You should've told me you were coming.
I could've prepared for your birthday.
What really happened to you?
And then you'll come here drenched in the rain.
I don't know.
I was disoriented.
"I can't remember, I didn't know where I live."
That's why I went to your house.
-It's good you didn't get lost--
"-Bela, I really wanted to be with you."
"Wait, wait!"
You have to go home.
-Joy might be looking for you.
-I don't give a damn about Joy.
What if he's not with Bela?
.
And he was picked on in the streets?
And something bad happened to him that I don't know.
"Sis, sister, just go to sleep."
Do you know that's what I wanted to hear from you when I came back from Canada?
But you chose Joy.
And you got married.
I know.
But I'm not happy with her.
This is where I was in foster care.
"Oh, sorry."
Me and two other dudes and a girl with messed-up fingers.
I'm so lucky I got out of here.
It's not luck.
"I mean, you got out of here because you're very talented and people love you and..."
Are you peeing?
Where's Donaghy?
I want to talk to him right now.
"Last time I saw him, he was riding the crane camera."
"Oh, I have Pete for you."
"Pete, oh, my God, I didn't know."
"No, hey, listen, it will give me a chance to spend more time with my kids."
I'm quitting.
I'm quitting right now.
"No, no, no, no, no."
You have the best job in New York.
Don't quit over this.
"Don't buy all the hot dogs, okay?"
I don't want to do this without you.
"Hey, I thought we cut the cat-lady sketch."
We're two minutes short!
[Cats meowing]
"[Scratchy voice] So, let me introduce myself."
My name is Lurlene Katz.
And these are my cats.
She's using a real cat?
I cast that cat myself.
"Why, they are my..."
Aah!
Ow!
[Peanut growls] Oh!
- What about you?
- That's okay.
- We'll just stay for one night.
- No vacancies on the weekend.
I think he's fooling us.
It wasn't so expensive before.
I agree.
It's a rip off.
The rooms seem pretty much empty.
- See?
No one's here.
- You're right.
He was trying to make you stay longer.
"We'll stay here the night, and I'll look for some place cheaper."
- Let's look for one after we eat.
- Sure.
There's a lighthouse.
The sandstorm is not so bad.
How fortunate.
"Oh yeah, I enjoyed the music."
- Wasn't it nice?
- Yeah.
- Did you really like it?
- Yes.
The melody is soothing.
Nothing exaggerated.
You sung how an average person would.
I liked that amateur feel to it.
I admire your good taste in music.
"Changwook, I admire you as well."
How?
It's hard for a married man to openly bring along his girlfriend like you.
Hey...
And you just left?
Yup.
So it's over?
I don't know.
She says that every time and then she goes back to him.
Well maybe I'm just being paranoid?
It was time for the bi-monthly...
breakup post modern.
Who said what...
did I handle it well etc.
Can I ask you something JP?
What baby?
Come back to bed.
How many girls are you sleeping with?
Baby why you so drama?
So what?
So drama.
"I mean why would he hang out with me for six months, and text and call... everyday?"
Last night I was trying to make this really good point.
We just had sex JP.
It's good.
I just had your penis inside of me.
But that sounded...
a lot better in my head.
Ouch...
- Sorry.
Last week bird crap this week balls in her face.
Ah it's typical.
Is it true he has a monster schlong?
I don't know where she gets her information.
But that's absolutely true.
"I was doing it in her sleep, but you woke her up."
I did wrap the blade in silk.
She's not hurting too much.
Come!
Do you want to finish the job?
Mary...
I love her.
And me.
- Do you love me?
"- Léo, yes!"
"Speaking of which, she told me again that I made love to her like nobody else."
Then she told me that it wasn't important.
"My father, my mother, you."
Love.
"The same feet, the same toes,"
the same footprints.
Footprints change with the sole of your shoes.
"The mud without marks, that's me."
You're cold.
You're warm.
You're hot.
You burn.
You kill.
Do you want to finish me?
Don't piss about!
"Take off your sneakers, so they think we aren't here."
I won't give her up to anybody.
No.
She belongs to me.
"If God made us, he would have made us different."
The rats have made off.
I'm offering you quiet on the Western front!
Rough day?
Y-yeah.
Were you -- were you saving this?
"No, no."
It's fine.
"But you don't usually drink, Clark."
What's wrong?
"Martha, you know how much I love you, don't you?"
Of course.
But with this job...
I can't always be as...
honest as I would like.
"Well, I know that."
"Thing is, you don't know."
"You don't know, so stop saying that you know."
Okay.
"It's okay that you have moods, Clark."
I'm not afraid of the different sides of you.
I love all of you.
"The world is an ugly place, Martha."
"And it is full of brutish, cruel, nasty people."
I heard something on the recording from Gaad's office.
Is he in more trouble?
He's probably gonna lose his pension -- maybe even go to jail.
- You shouldn't feel sorry for him.
"- Well, how can I not?"
- Martha.
- This is tearing him apart.
Martha...
Gaad is not your friend.
"Oh, come on, guys."
Martha's ugly.
That's the end of the day.
Thank you very much.
Your graded papers are down here at the end.
You can pick them up on your way out.
I am invincible.
"Guys, Jill Taylor, 10 o'clock."
Man.
That's brutal.
"You know, you should just ask her out, man."
It's not like she's a rocket scientist or anything.
"Oh, wait, she is."
"Well, why don't you ask her?"
Because I'm already dating someone.
"Yeah, your right hand doesn't count, Miles."
It does the way I use it.
It does the way I use it.
"Hey, you know what?"
Maybe I don't even want to go out with her.
"Yeah, that's funny."
"You know, you say you want a life experience, right?"
"Well, I'd say getting down with that would definitely qualify."
Cam!
Boy genius.
You have to follow me now.
- Excuse me?
- You have to follow me now.
Come on.
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.
Our honored guest.
"- How you doing, Ben?"
- I'm okay.
He did it.
"Hurry up, we only have 20 seconds."
Here it is.
All right.
What would have happened if he hadn't given himself away?
This is a dangerous game.
That's a passenger plane!
Now the myth of Carrasco is finished.
"Damn it, Enrique, they're simply cleverer than us."
They should have got them by now.
Let's go.
- We can't get through there in the Jeep.
- I want Carrasco!
Don't you dare come back without him!
Over there!
Find him!
Find him!
Enrique!
We'll get you out of here.
- Did you shoot the bastard down?
- No.
It wasn't him.
- We were set up.
- I knew it would go wrong.
I sensed it from the start.
"Come on, we must get away."
Help me.
"Hurry up, but be careful."
They'll remember us for a while.
Bastards!
I've always wished for something like this.
The bloody bastards!
"Prisoners are taken out on work detail one block at a time, right?"
- Same time every day.
- An ambush?
When guards are vulnerable.
It's not like we're liberating the whole camp anyway.
"Assuming we can get them out, there'll be search parties."
They're not in any condition to run for long.
I'll need to find a place to hide them.
"I'll do more recon, map out a route."
Gather all the guns
- we have.
- What can I do?
You've been through a lot.
Just stay out of trouble.
"What, am I grounded?"
I do something wrong?
I didn't say you did.
- I want to help.
- And you can.
Someone needs to hold the fort.
He'll be all right.
We'll look after him.
I'll be fine.
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
Of course I've thought about it.
It's all I think about!
- Really?
- Yeah.
Or have you just thought about yourself?
Do you think that this is good for him?
That kid is gonna hate us if he has to grow up listening to us fight all day long.
"So that's it, then."
What about me?
- Am I just so easy to walk away from?
"- Lisa, I love you."
Don't you fucking say that to me!
"You have no idea what love is, Chris!"
Lisa.
Listen.
We have a problem and we have to face it.
"Oh, you're right, Chris."
You are absolutely right.
"Get the fuck out, you fucking asshole!"
You know what?
"If you want to go, go."
I release you.
Go be free.
"But don't you ever expect to see me or your child ever again, ever!"
"Lisa, stop it."
"Jesus, stop it."
Just go.
Please.
Go.
- You're staying at a motel?
"- No, it's a hotel."
And it's really very nice.
I can still race!
What do you think?
A thing of beauty.
- McQueen made it!
- What?
He's not pitting!
You gotta get me out there!
Let's go!
Get me back out there!
McQueen's not going into the pits!
The rookie fired his crew chief.
The third this season!
- Says he likes working alone.
"- Go, go!"
Looks like Chick got caught up in the pits.
"Yeah, after a stop like that, he's got a lot of ground to make up."
"Get ready, boys, we're coming to the restart!"
"Come on, come on, come on!"
We need tires now!
"Come on, let's go!"
"- No, no, no, no!"
"No tires, just gas!"
- What?
"You need tires, you idiot!"
Looks like it's gas-and-go's for McQueen today.
Right.
No tires again.
"That's a short-term gain, long-term loss, but it's workin' for him."
He obviously knows somethin' we don't know.
"This is it, Darrell."
One lap to go and Lightning McQueen has a huge lead.
He's got it in the bag.
"Iwas so thrilled, Alicia, to see you coming in alone today, just with canes, on your own."
Did you see?
Howwas rehab today?
Very good.
Are you tired?
"Yes, very."
Doesn't matter.
We'll do some additional exercices.
We'll do some leg stretches.
I've done 100 today already.
We'll do just a few more.
Good morning.
I'm here to see Mr. Sanz.
Come in.
Thank you.
The fetus was born dead.
It was a boy.
But Alicia woke up.
Benigno should be told.
"Given his mental state, I think not."
He could do something crazy.
But Icant lie to him.
"I'm his only friend, he trusts me."
I'll do it.
It's not a dilemma for me.
I'll tell him that Alicia is still in a coma and the baby is dead.
But you must promise me that you'll say nothing.
What about bail?
"It'll be very difficult, and expensive."
But we can try.
Number eight.
You got wet.
- Cut it out!
- You're doing good.
- I know.
I've been on ice before.
I like your army jacket.
Is it from a real dead guy?
You're funny.
"Hey, you want to come back to my house and watch TV or something?"
- Really?
- My mom punched a cop so she's gone for a few days.
Uh...
"Yeah, sure."
Whatever.
Thank you so much!

"Leave us alone, Jimmy!"
"Oh, one lucky punch and you think you're tough now?"
It wasn't lucky.
It's such a blessing to have a husband who's so happy.
He's always singing.
- He loves to color my hair and do my...
"- Ginny, please stop."
"I'm really glad you and Greg are happy, but we are not doing well, okay?"
Frank's depressed right now.
Maybe he should take a Pray Away cruise.
We can barely afford to put gas in the car right now.
"It's just, he's really down in the dumps."
- He's usually so full of life.
"- Well, that's one way of putting it."
I just want my husband back.
Take him.
"Dad, I am fine..."
You forgot these in the car.
We'll take care of that.
I have to be honest.
I don't need these anymore.
Shove them up your ass.
How about shoving them up your girlfriend's ass.
Stick them up your mother's cunt.
"Pick on someone your own size, asshole."
"Dad, I will go faraway."
Forgive me.
I am a faggot.
It's all my fault.
What's your show tonight?
"Here, this is for making a Zenne out of me."
You're a natural.
"Take this, idiot."
Go to my apartment and take whatever you want.
I don't need your filthy stuff.
Ah OK then...
Don't you ever wear colourless clothes again.
I don't want to see you in white ever again.
I'll miss you too.
Answer the phone.
Please.
You sneaky little cunt.
"You faggot's daughter, you!"
My brother is saving himself from you.
Your God left you a cripple.
You're gonna die here all alone.
Dad.
Drinks on the house.
"No, have the drink with me."
The drinks are on...the house.
I fucked kids like that in the can.
In the ass.
Fucking break up my party.
You been away for six years.
Everything is different now.
"I did my fucking time, Jimmy."
I came home and I want what I got to get.
I got fuckin' mouths to feed.
-You're gonna get it.
-You understand?
Get the door!
"Let me shoot him in his big, fucking mouth!"
Let's shoot him.
Fucking mutt dented my shoes.
His whole crews gonna be looking for him.
This is fuckin' bad.
What do we do with him?
We can't just dump him on the street.
Don't worry. I know a place upstate.
They'll never find him.
"Come on, let's get some more tablecloths."
I didn't want to get blood on your floor.
"Henry, go open your trunk."
We'll pick up a shovel at my mother's house.
She keeps a shovel lying' around here somewhere.
"Just keep quiet though, I don't want to wake her up."
Look who's here.
What are you doing?
What happened?
An investment to be clear.
Not a fucking handout!
That said...
I did remind him... of the night we shared together.
"And how it would be a tad embarrassing if, uh... well, if anyone found out about it."
"Which is technically blackmail, I suppose, but whatever."
I filmed it.
You see?
Suck it.
I think we can all agree.
That the truth hurts.
Here.
This will help with the pain.
"Thanks for the party, guys."
She's dead.
"Get lost, you bloody queer!"
Oops.
We're done here.
May I invite you all to join me in a toast?
"Yes, you can."
One year's out and in the end we're all still breathing.
Gin - fucking gin!
Gin - fucking gin!
Yeah.
"We'll be celebrating later, aren't you?"
"Uh, Jesus Christ!"
"Oh, we're going to be right at the end of that--"
Get off me.
"Chris, I've seen you in the shower you were to be in heaven!"
- It's the old lad.
"- Oh, bad to be on that!"
- What?
- Where am I?
With me.
In my world.
What do you mean?
How could you bring me here?
I asked...
But you didn't reply.
"Obviously, I was drunk, right?"
Just a second.
What did you mix in my drink?
It took me 25 years to find you.
What?
What if I tell you that we've met before?
What if I tell you there was a time when we loved each other like crazy?
And then someone separated us.
What would you say to that?
Then I'd say that you have gone crazy and you need help.
No.
No.
I am not crazy.
Doctors too used to say the same.
They were treating me.
They were trying to erase the image from my mind.
But how could I forget you?
I found you.
All the questions became meaningless.
My existence is for you.
- This is what the universe wants.
- Just leave me.
Let me go.
"- Wait Saira, wait!"
Huge.
I'm the most wanted man on this planet.
Bounty hunters of all types are after me skin.
My face is plastered on wanted posters in every town on seven countries.
"Oh, yeah."
I'm infamous.
No.
I don't believe it.
Got it!
I think they're gone.
Are you sure?
"Aye, it's quiet."
Jump now!
- This might not work.
- Of course it works.
We're a lethal pair.
Behind you!
The arrow relies on the bow.
"The bow, on the arrow."
But they are not tied together.
"That would be pointless now, wouldn't it?"
Exactly.
"Together we are formidable but shackled, our power is pointless."
- We must be free.
"- Aye, free."
And we'll take them together!
Is that the best you can do?
I'd say we've wiped out our bounty-hunter problem.
- For now.
- Aye.
For now.
I was wrong about you.
"- Oh, great, now I'm all nervous."
- Don't be.
No man would invite you on his motorcycle unless he's ready to make a commitment.
You expect me to believe that?
"No, but you made lying look like so much fun, I thought I'd give it a whack."
"So, um,"
I'm going upstairs to throw out all my booze and not eat these donuts.
"Yeah, it is fun."
Morning.
"Oh, my God, I got flowers."
They're on my desk and you assume they're for you?
"Oh, I'm so sorry."
They're for you.
Hmm...
I wonder who they're from.
I wasn't even going to ask.
I know how much you value your privacy.
It's not signed.
"It just says, ""Had a great time."""
- Molly.
- What?
Are you seeing someone?
Someone I don't know about?
How am I going to help you cover it up if I don't know what you're hiding?
I've got nothing to hide.
But let's not mention these to my father.
"Or anyone who might tell my father, like... him."
"- Hey, Alex."
"- Hey, Stephen."
Alex?
One second.
Um... oh.
It opens up the room.
It can breathe.
Does it get you money?
You want it?
"Here, I'll give you the fucking money."
"If you want more, you can go down and tear some off the wall."
No.
I don't want your money.
I don't need it.
But I do need a door.
So I could close it behind me.
I thought you'd like it.
I do like it.
In some way I do like it.
It's dreary.
Of course.
"Arise, you wretched of the earth!"
"Arise, you wretched of the earth!"
"Arise, you prisoners of starvation!"
"Forjustice thunders condemnation,"
It is the eruption of the end!
Is this what you were thinking?
"- Okay, that's enough!"
You'll sing for me.
I'm not finished yet.
You're still singing for me.
- I have to ask Franz first.
You need written permission?
I'll think about it.
Don't take so long.
He found some chicks that aren't too bad either.
They're taller than you too.
Yeah.
"I mean, no."
"No, things aren't weird, or no to the sex?"
- Maybe we should just...
- You're right.
"Just concentrate on Figgis, and we'll figure this out later."
"No, I was gonna say maybe we should talk, but yeah, it can wait till after Figgis."
Ah.
We have the rest of our lives to talk.
"Yeah, unless he kills us first."
What a weird joke.
Regret saying that one.
"Wow, things are clickin'."
I'm gonna go make sure there's enough balls in...
in the ball pit.
Yup.
Important to get on them balls.
What is wrong with me?
"So then Trevor sends me a text, and he's like,"
"""At this point, I hate you."""
"I'm like, ""Oh, really?"
"'Cause you didn't hate me last week."""
Trevor sounds like a dog.
Right?
"God, I missed our daily dishes."
Me too.
"I'm sorry I'm not reciprocating with ""hot goss"" of my own."
I'm just worried about the Nine-Nine.
"Sir, they're gonna be fine."
They're my squad.
I should be there with them.
This is killing me.
- That's enough.
- I thought you quit smoking.
- The gum didn't work.
Who's she?
- That's my new partner.
- Not bad.
- You didn't know about that?
"- No, why should I?"
Coming back to the force?
See what you're missing?
Tommy!
- You want to get some dinner?
- What did I say?
- I just invited him to dinner.
- Go up there!
- He hasn't changed a bit.
"- Yeah, that's the problem."
- What do you know?
- We just fished out the body.
Don't play games with me.
I want to know what you know.
You don't want to hear it.
It's the same guy.
- The same guy?
As in Polish Hill?
- Fair hair.
Good bodies.
"These women were shot, not strangled."
They had neck bruises and were bound wrist and ankle.
- Eiler told me you know this girl.
- A lot of guys knew her.
"If I didn't know better, I'd think you didn't want to solve this case."
I like her.
"I like her, too."
She likes me.
I guess you didn't have your eyes peeled.
It was me she was flipping her frills and furbelows at.
"Just a minute, jim- here, here... if the lady comes up, i go backstage."
"If the eagle shines, the pass-through's all yours."
All right.
Uh- let me flip it.
Where did it go?
"I don't know, but you better hurry and find it."
The show's over.
She'll be going out with someone else.
"Nick, you go back to her dressing room and ask her if she'll go to a lobster party."
"Soon as i find this lucky piece, i'll join you."
Luke?
Yeah.
You go over to the astor house and reserve the best table in the place.
Yeah.
And send somebody here with a lantern.
Idiot!
Imbecile!
"You want to be an actress, eh?"
"Well, here is good luck!"
I've had just about enough of this!
Someone is at the door!
See who it is!
Yes?
"Oh, good evening, mademoiselle."
I see my flowers have arrived.
"Oh, you are mr."
Fisk.
- If you need anything else...
Yeah.
"Actually, um, is there any reason why people would be uncomfortable with me being here?"
No reason.
It's great.
But I'm swamped.
I should go.
"No, no, please."
"Really, I feel like I have spinach in my teeth and nobody is telling me."
We all just really care about the senator.
"Personally, I think you make a really cute couple."
Couple!
C...
Couple?
No.
"No, no, no, no, no."
We are...
That...
No.
There's no couple.
I'm just part of his communications staff.
- There's no coupling.
- I get it.
You want to keep it on the down low.
I don't want to keep it on the down or the low.
I don't want to keep it anywhere.
There's nothing to keep anyway.
- I arranged for you to go to his ranch.
- For the day.
For the day.
It was one day.
It turned into just a couple of hours.
Executive decision.
Horses can eat a bunch of pudding.
My cousin from Chernobyl had a dog this size.
He had three legs.
"My cousin, not the dog."
Something good did come out of Chernobyl.
Excuse me?
How much do you charge for pictures with him?
"Oh, it depends."
How nude do you want him?
Ew.
We mean for our kids... with the horse.
"I don't think the ""ew"" was necessary."
You don't know what you're missing.
"I mean, we're just walking him for our friend."
We'll give you $10 each.
Sold to the woman who...
"""Doesn't"" wanna see me naked."
"Come on, 18!"
Which is also the title of my adult film debut.
"Mine would have been called,"
"""Might As Well, I'm 24."""
"Excuse me, Mr. Moustache?"
Could you stop feeling my ankle with your toes?
I guess that's a no.
"Oh, 18 winner."
We won!
I'm rich!
Now you have no shot with me.
"Stay close, sweet cakes."
You're good luck.
"Here, buddy."
"Encouragement my ass, Daddy!"
You ain't even trying!
"Look, yoga's not my strong suit."
Yoga's not your strong suit?
"Oh, look at this one."
This little one is flexible.
She's good.
She's really good.
"Ooh, fantastic."
So you do like the lizard.
"Now is when we transfer the energy, you see?"
Yep.
And you just lay everything on top of her?
Yes.
Lay it on.
Stretch.
"That feels pretty good, hon?"
What?
"Am I straight enough here, do you think?"
Or am I curving a little?
Let me show you.
You feel the transfer of the energy.
"Well, it feels solid."
It is tantric energy.
Yeah.
It is karma.
Yes.
"Okay, now I want all my girls in a downward dog position."
"Yes, this pose contains a tantric hip thrust."
Now you and I will try this.
"You got a pose called ""Yoga Guy Gets His Ass Kicked',?"
"""Cause that's my favorite one."
Who was it?
Do you want me to sort him out for you?
"Sure, I already offered..."
"Grow up, will you?"
No bullets?
No.
"Well, what's the point of giving you a gun... if they don't give you Jesus bullets?"
So we wouldn't shoot anyone.
I thought that was the point.
How else you supposed to keep the bleedin' peace?
"That's crazy, that is."
"It was no joke, all right?"
You had to look straight at 'em.
- Who?
- The Arabs.
Straight at them.
Straight into their eyes.
Mesmerize them.
"Easier said than done, I'd say."
Who are you telling?
Thanks.
"Hit me, will you?"
Get out!
"Hey, Sharon."
You forgot your piss.
Urine.
Da!
"Next time you try that, you better watch it."
"For God's sake, are you daft?"
He's not only daft.
He's such a roving eye for everybody in this hospital.
Did you see him?
"Don't freak, all right?"
We didn't get ripped off.
But Badger hasn't kicked in his full amount.
I know he was planning on pulling an all-nighter so he's probably still in the sack.
Then wake him up.
He can sleep after we're paid.
Why you gotta be such a hard-on?
You're not his pal.
You're his boss.
"This only works when they're scared of you, remember?"
Jack-off.
It's going straight to voicemail.
Voicemail?
"Just chill, okay?"
Count your money.
- Combo.
"- Yo, what's up?"
You seen Badger?
"Don't you cover for him, bitch."
"I ask you a straight-up question, I expect a straight-up answer."
Well?
They were too scared to tell me.
Badger got busted.
He's in jail.
"Honey, I'm home!"
Too slow!
What's up?
Got more lives than a damn cat.
Now if I could only learn to lick myself.
"What's up, guys?"
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
That's good then.
Excellent.
I'll stay for a few more weeks for the peace and quiet.
We'll take the next boat.
"If you'd been really ill, I wouldn't have told you anything."
This is why I'm here.
He's in Holland for a week.
"Good morning, Mr Haverman."
"Morning, sir."
Here you are.
Your morning portion.
The doctor says you'd better stay in bed.
"Yes, I understand, nurse."
Thank you.
"Later, after the visitor will have left."
Don't be too long.
You have to be fit for the cure.
Busybody.
That's what I'm ripping those assholes of the insurance company off for.
450 guilders a day.
-462.50.
What?
-I work in insurance.
"Oh, yes."
I know where he is.
And what he's doing this week.
It's Niels for sure.
I have to tell you something.
It's such an old case.
"Back then, you swore we'd liquidate him."
I'm not well.
It's been so long.
- What a pro.
What a pro.
- I didn't ask him to do that.
- He's aces.
"- Yeah, I know."
I didn't ask him to do that.
He just did it.
Really thoughtful.
- He was hilarious.
- I didn't dislike smooching Jay.
It's hot.
I'm just gonna say it.
"- Just, you know, say it."
- Just gonna say it out loud.
- that gay band We're Gay.
It was great because...
- We're Gay.
- We're Gay.
We had been shooting for a while when he came in.
And we had all gotten pretty tight pretty fast and it was just cool.
He came in and was just so awesome.
"- Yeah, he jumped in."
- Just jumped right in.
"Oh, man, do you remember Rafi put a bunch of Babybel..."
"- You know, the Babybel cheese things?"
"- Oh, yeah."
They come wrapped in wax and Rafi got a bunch of those and balled them up and put them in the back of Jay's jacket as a joke.
"And Jay was okay, but the wardrobe lady was not pleased with it."
"Oh, man."
"I won't name names, but she was angry."
What happened?
Did they melt all over the place?
- Are you lonely?
- Yes.
I have no expectations.
Nothing.
We should earn the real thing without any help from others.
But I think I still want to get it through people.
I know I shouldn't expect it of them.
- A real pleasure meeting you.
- Same here.
"Me, too."
"You know my intentions were genuine earlier, right?"
"Yes, of course."
You never quit.
So strange.
I wonder what's so fun about it.
They're just enjoying themselves.
Why did Nature have to divide us into male and female?
I'm so sick of it.
"You're a male, yourself."
You know that.
"Yeah, yeah."
That's why I'm like this.
Want to drink some more?
"Yes, well, as you like."
As I like?
So you want to drink more or not?
"Really, do as you like."
"If you want to drink, then do so."
"Okay, I'll go buy some more."
"Moonsook, I need to ask you something."
Can you come over here?
Sure.
But now you've grown selfish and unkind.
"What's happened to your heart, jim?"
"It belongs to you, josie, just like you're going to belong to me."
Stop being afraid.
We've climbed above right and wrong.
"They're trying to pull us down, but they can't."
We're going higher and higher and higher!
Offering 150 for any part of 2 million!
"500,000 at 150!"
I'll take it.
Any more bids?
"If it breaks 160, it'll hit 200!"
We're not gonna let it break 160!
Jim!
She's just broke 150.
150?
157!
Why aren't you in the gold room?
"Oh, i'm getting jumpy, boss."
"I tell you, wall street's gone plumb crazy."
This thing's out of control!
Because i got 'em cornered!
I got all the gold there is outside the treasury.
"But i'm still buying, luke."
We can't hold anymore!
We're done for!
Let's get out of here while we're still alive!
I can't stay with you!
It's going to hit 200!
Stick with me!
You can't lose!
1621/2!
"Who are ""they,"" friend?"
"Marauders, maybe."
I don't know.
"The same ones that killed Silmser, huh?"
Maybe.
Now will you take these chains off?
Not yet.
That's Times' place?
That's right.
And it never runs dry?
So they say.
Get away from the rifle.
You are getting hasty.
You'll get yourself killed.
"I could die of thirst while you was being too careful, too."
- Anything in it?
- In what?
In the bucket!
"Well, it sure is heavy."
That was my shot foot you dragged me in here with!
- You gonna die on me?
- No.
- You still shoot?
- Yes!
"Friend, you wouldn't shoot me in the back?"
"Friend, if I was gonna shoot you, it wouldn't be in the back."
"Cover, please."
Just tell him to put that down on the floor.
That weapon gives him adult status.
Tommy... put it down.
Please.
"You hurt my sister, I'll kill you."
My mom is not sick.
She's not sick.
Okay.
Where you going?
Away.
With a man I met from est.
"What do you mean, ""Away""?"
Away.
I don't know.
"Uh, for a few days."
"We've, um had this emotional connection for some time, and we just want to see if there is something else there."
You're telling me you're going to have an affair?
Sandra?
I might.
I don't know.
At least I'm being honest.
Go ahead.
Tell me that you're not having an affair.
I'm --
You know what kills me about the whole thing?
"Is that you didn't have any idea anything was going on -- you, Mr. Counterintelligence Genius."
You just didn't see it?
So you either didn't want to know or you didn't care enough to pay attention.
Who is he?
"Oh, it doesn't matter, really."
"- Who is he, Sandra?"
Who is he?
- It doesn't matter who he is.
What are you gonna do -- go arrest him?
Sandra.
Sandra.
Are you leaving me?
That's quite good.
"Well, I don't know, it was very catty."
Hmm.
"Now if you want to ask me any questions, you can ask me through your animal."
Do I have to speak in the animal language?
That's what I said.
"""Why were you at Simon Cowell's house?"""
I went to see Simon Cowell.
"""What was it about?"""
"Can we stop asking the same question, please?"
"Yes, sorry."
This is a place of respite and I wish to meditate.
"Now, I will offer you guys the chance to join me if you'd so like to."
Would you like to?
"Yes, we'd love to."
Take a seat.
Of course.
Love to.
"Meditation, have you done it before, Dermot?"
Right.
Now I sense that you two are searching for answers on the outside.
Yes.
PHONE RINGS
Whose phone is that?
That's not my phone.
It's not my phone.
I gave Philip my phone.
It's coming from you.
Why can I hear it coming from this direction?
It's not my phone...
It's coming from here!
What's going...?
"Like I said, an open book."
How would you know that?
"I spent many years in Neverland, home of the lost boys."
They all share the same look in their eyes... the look you get when you've been left alone.
"Yeah, well, my world ain't Neverland."
But an orphan's an orphan.
"Love has been all too rare in your life, hasn't it?"
You ever even been in love?
No.
I have never been in love.
I think this little guy is hungry.
(Laughs)
"Go ahead and get whatever you want, sweetie."
- I'm gonna get directions.
- I will.
"Hey, man."
How are you?
I've been better.
"Listen, my wife and I... are really lost."
"I'm trying to get to Eugene, and I think we've been going the wrong way."
Can you show me what's going on here?
"Where are we, first of all?"
"Okay, wait."
Do I look like a tour guide?
Why don't you buy the map?
Then I can help you.
Okay.
Okay.
Now your problem is... (Map rustles)
Is you're way up here.
You see that?
"(Door bell chimes) Oh, my God."
- That's what I'm saying.
- His illness is your business.
"- Lf not mine, whose?"
"- Lf not now, when?"
Were you just talking about me?
"No, an old friend of ours, Gary."
"Oh, the guy with cancer?"
You told her?
She's not your wife.
"If I told you, you would've given it away."
- You don't think I can keep a secret?
"- No, but he would have read your face."
- You don't trust my poker face?
- Do you ever win at poker?
No.
Hey.
"Oh, I just saw your old boyfriend on TV."
- Jake Jarmel?
- Yeah.
I like those glasses he was wearing.
Where'd he get those?
- Why?
You don't wear glasses.
- I know.
But I need a new look.
I'm stagnating.
"I have to say, as a glasses- wearer, I take exception to that."
That's like me buying a wheelchair to cruise around in.
"Yeah, I've considered that."
"Look, how do I get in touch with this guy?"
He's having a two-day book signing at Walden's.
"You know, we had a really bad breakup."
"Dale, it's Gig."
- His machine.
- Oh.
"Um, see, things have got a little bit sticky over here."
"Slight change of plans, nothing that your deft touch couldn't rectify."
So either swing by or call back.
That'd be marvelous.
- Thank you.
- Great.
- Slight snag though.
- What?
"Well, Dale - blesshim - has been doing favor after favor for us."
"If it's not one thing, it's the other."
So -
- So what's your point?
- [ Sighs ]
"If he's gets the ticket back for us, we'll have to give him more money."
- No.
No way.
NO.
- That would only be fair.
There is a limit to my classiness.
- Quite obviously.
- Shut up!
I'll handle this.
You just leave Dale out of it.
Bunch of morons.
I have to do everything myself!
- Hi.
"- Well, well, well."
Look who it is.
An old face from the past.
"No, I'm not coming, I'm going to the fields."
"Come on, get in..."
No. I'm going to the farm.
"- Come on, I'll bring you back."
- No.
Why haven't you got out?
"Go on, get out."
Take the wheel.
Give my colleagues the keys.
Don't forget.
"Will he make it, doctor?"
"Yes, he just needed oxygen."
A jab and a respirator will put him right.
We've sent him to town.
Oxygen will save him.
- Where are you going?
- Down there.
There's a sick woman.
Perhaps you could see her.
All right.
- Do you mind?
"- No, no problem."
It's a miracle he survived.
He was lucky.
The stone got stuck before it struck his head.
Then some stones gave way.
"He was trapped, as if he was in a tiny cell."
He needed oxygen.
"If he gets oxygen, he'll pull through all right."
He was covered in dirt.
"""lf my guardian angel is hhe one I know,"
"""he'll prohech glass from shone."""
I got it under control!
I took a goddamn red-eye to be here this morning.
I'm exhausted.
I hate this fucking city.
You can't talk to me that way.
I'm not a fucking kid anymore.
What the fuck happened to you?
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
"You're a dead man, you know that?"
It's not the first time I've heard that today.
Stupid fucking cop.
Do you know who my father is?
Where's the little girl?
I don't know what you're talking about.
"For your sake, I hope that's a lie."
"Look at you, you stupid fucking nigger cop."
I'm gonna ask you one more time.
Where's the little girl?
[cell phone rings] [grunts]
Fuck.
[cell phone rings]
"Rook, did you--did you hang up the phone on me?"
"Is that what you did, Rook?"
I'm afraid Rook can't come to the phone right now.
Who is this?
Does it matter?
Put Rook on the phone.
It's too late for that.
If that's true
I'm talking to a dead man.
So they keep telling me.
Where's the girl?
Love you to drop by.
That's very kind of you.
Bring a guest if you like.
"A friend, lover."
Anyone you want.
"After you, sir."
Mr Harper.
Len.
How can I help you?
"It's this brochure of yours, it was found at a crime scene."
The police?
"No, no, I'm just making enquiries."
It's a personal matter.
"Yeah, those are our products, but...this isn't our brochure."
It has your company name on it.
"It's the 2010 line, but this isn't the promotional material we went with."
♪ Now I can't remember ♪
♪ How it goes but I know That I won't forget her ♪
♪ 'Cause we danced all night To the best song ever ♪

Am I better when I'm naked?
Ha-ha-ha.
"- I like being, um, free."
"I recorded ""What Makes You Beautiful"" in my boxers."
Who gets to go on the O2 stage in their dressing gown?
"Not many, so I'm gonna live that dream, boys."
And I'm gonna go out there and rock me little socks off.
"Thanks, everyone!"
♪ Said her name was Georgia Rose ♪
Free hugs.
Nita Caglar?
This is the name she spoke.
A Kurdish girl.
Okay.
She works a little for me.
"Without a permit visa, but that shit, I'm helping people."
How old is she?
15.
"A friend of his daughter, perhaps?"
Zana lives in Sweden with his mother.
What does this have to do with it?
When was the last time you saw her?
Six months ago.
Where is she?
She ran away from home.
Reported her as missing.
Why did she do it?
How should I know?
She contacted?
-I Would say is yes.
"If I do not get hysterical, does not mean I do not care."
Perhaps you do not have children.
Then I'll tell you something.
They are like a part of you.
But you can not make them be better.
"So if there is something more, take me to the police station."
One more thing.
I never liked cops.
No one died?
That's great!
Have you managed to track down the girl?
Let's wait for the experts.
I want to know when!
Years ago?
Months ago?
Weeks ago?
It was the night of the fire.
But it was friend sex.
I swear.
He was just so desperate.
He needed someone.
He needed comforting.
So you slept with him?
"Just so we're perfectly clear, you and Ben had sex?"
And he's been trying to make me feel bad about sleeping with Adrian!
And you didn't tell me?
You just let me feel bad about it?
You let me agonize over that one stupid mistake when the two of you did something just as bad!
Or even worse!
What did I ever do to you that you did this to me?
Were you ever going to tell me?
"I mean, if you did this just to get back at me for breaking up with me I think you'd want me to know."
"Geez, Alice."
That's really low.
Henry!
"Pick me up at seven, okay?"
Seven.
I got it.
I'll be there.
What?
You're gonna go through with this?
"Oh, yeah."
Game on.
Hi.
- I love you too.
I'm OK.
OK.
Your mom told me what happened.
I'm sorry.
- Sorry about missing dinner.
- It's OK.
I was just worried.
The last time you sounded like that...
I was with my sponsor.
Oh.
- That's good.
"- Look, I get it if you're angry at me."
I'm not angry.
I just don't know if I can handle it.
That's why they tell you not to date anyone your first year you're clean.
I never understood that before tonight because I couldn't deal with anyone or anything but me.
That's how it should be.
"Look, you weren't wrong to worry, OK?"
"I just don't think I'm ready for a relationship, Tyler."
I know.
I know.
I just want you to be OK.
"More than anything I want for us, I want that for you."
Come here.
It's OK.
Have you talked to Mom?
"I keep trying to reach her, but she's not picking up, at least not for me."
"Yeah, not for me either."
Let me be the one to kick Holly out of our lives once and for all.
"Sarah, Holly's not going anywhere."
Nor do I want her to.
"Lately, he's taken in two disciples and taught them kung-fu"
"They're not bad, I hear!"
Okay-find a way to get him here!
"We'll try him, and kill him if necessary"
This jade nine-dragon cup is our heirloom
Emperor Chien Lung liked it very much
Very nice
How nice for a common fellow to use it!
Come on-bottoms up!
"Please have some tea, sir"
A toast to you!
"Fine, fine..."
We'll drink until we're drunk!
Right-have some more!
Some more!
"No, no-that's dangerous!"
It's best not to drink too much
"Come on, have a drink!"
Have a drink!
"No, no..."
You've had a lot-l'll help you inside
Who says I'm drunk?
I'm no drunk!
What's this?
Playing for keeps?
Right-l wasn't your life for keeps
"Oh, no."
Master's falling-down drunk!
Don't stay here
We've got to find a way to save him!
Can we do it?
Yes-with this!
"How'd you like to help me do some good, serve up a little karmic justice?"
–Joe...
"–Hey, 20 bucks says we bust him on a felony before nightfall."
These assholes could win a lottery and still not keep their noses clean.
See that little prick?
"He got one over on me, man."
–You know that ain't right.
"–Yes, I know it's not right."
–Then here we go.
–Lookee here!
–Jesus Christ.
–Bitch that made me rich!
"You thought it'd be fun to beat on me like a punk nigga now, huh?"
–Who's the nigga now?
–Hey!
Step back!
Yeah.
Here.
Go get yourself some new gear on me.
"Go back to your party, burn out whatever brain cells you got left."
"Come on, bitch."
Hit me!
I could use another couple million.
–Put the camera down.
–Come on.
Show's just startin'.
"Hey, let go of him!"
Let go!
–Back off!
–That's all right.
I'll just buy me a new one.
"Hey, what's this?"
We're passing ships.
We've met a few times.
You were on tour somewhere and we...
Yeah.
Yeah.
And one time I don't remember.
"No, I don't."
Yeah.
It was a crazy night.
LAUGHTER
"Ten past one, Rob!"
I've had similar experiences with Ronnie Corbett where the two of us are smashed off our tits.
Literally no memory of what time we left the golf club.
So it seems silly to ask you if you're a party girl.
Don't you try to deny it!
Slightly retired.
I'm a country bumpkin now.
You moved to the country.
Is that a real thing?
It's not like a stage!
It's real.
I've got a veggie patch and everything.
A veggie patch?
"It's not a euphemism, Noel."
So you're out in the country and you're acting more now.
I am.
Is that as big a thing as the music?
I think music's my first love.
I couldn't ever not do music.
"But acting, yeah, totally."
Love it.
I nearly wanted you.
Please sit down.
How do you like it here?
"It's a beautiful country, isn't it?"
- Yes.
- Could I see your papers?
"- Oh, come on."
You can overdo things.
- I'm supposed to check all civilians.
Certainly.
Don't get worked up.
There you are.
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Where are you going?
"To the radio room, to check everything."
These militiamen are fanatical.
They'd frisk their own granny.
- We have nothing to hide.
- But it's unnecessary.
He's just a busybody who's seeing how far he can go.
Who is he going to call by radio?
The Holy Father?
"Oh, I'm sorry."
Priests have a sense of humour too.
Everything's all right.
Open the gate.
We're going to the depot now.
We'll be there soon.
- I'm sure it's hotter here than it is in hell.
- It might get even hotter.
"Oh, I see, yes."
We're nearly there now.
This is the fuel depot.
My memory is like a 70-year-old granny's.
I always leave my phone in the office once or twice a day.
I'm one of the better cases.
One of my colleagues has a neck brace for her phone.
What?
You said that we don't have enough time.
Let's use it wisely.
Is something wrong?
"I know you could be angry, but you shouldn't be this mad."
What's wrong?
Did you order steak?
They are cold.
-It's ok.
"-Leave them, I'll order again."
I can see stars already.
-I said leave them.
-You said there's no time.
Let's just eat.
Sit!
There's salad.
"Bread, plenty to eat."
"Oh yeah, I should drink wine first."
When you called me stupid my stomach got upset.
Even stupid people get shocked from that.
Did you know that I was stupid now?
"This isn't the first time you were called ""stupid."""
"That ""stupid"" was different from ""stupid"" before."
Aren't you going to drink?
You have to drive?
So do I.
A glass will be ok within an hour.
It shows.
On your feet.
Hold on just a second.
Where are your manners?
"If you try something, I'll kill her!"
Don't make it worse for yourselves.
Come out with your hands up.
We won't hurt you.
"Aldin, I'm here!"
Don't worry anymore.
Your Renato is here.
You're gonna ruin everything!
"Renato, I want to go home!"
Don't worry.
I'll take you home.
"Shut up, for God's sake!"
Get him out of here.
Don't talk to me in that tone of voice.
Don't get so excited.
I'll keep still.
Tie him up!
Listen to me.
The dastards took a shot at me!
Ask for a plane.
In exchange for what?
For that.
For that thing?
Would you exchange a plane for that?
"A child, a woman, a priest, yes, dut that?"
Pretend I'm not here.
It doesn't matter.
You have two minutes... or we'll open fire.
"Come and get us, you dastards!"
"You'll find out what's wrong, won't you?"
- You said you could.
"- Sure, my love."
"And you've always got me, in case of need."
Or did you want us both?
"No, I'm not like that."
Not the one and the other.
- lt's more either/or.
- Either/or?
What are you two either/or-ing?
"Gerard asked me about my morning, and I have to work."
"It's either working, or neglecting the salon."
Working?
Today?
I've taken the whole damned week off for you!
"It's just this morning, sweetheart."
Monday mornings I have to see my salesmen. I'll be froe this afternoon.
That's great!
I'll be bored to tears meanwhile.
- Do something with Gerard.
- He's here to work too!
So I don't work this morning.
Yes... show him around.
Or talk to him.
Perhaps he'll write about us.
Then we'll be in a book.
What's the use of being in a book?
You know what?
Take the car.
I don't need it anyway.
Shall we?
I have to get to the meeting.
Did you book this room in advance?
What do you think?
Did you push me into the lift on purpose?
"I just wanted to get to know you better, because you're the most popular girl in our company, ... but no one's ever dated you."
Please excuse me.
"Are you angry with me, princess?"
No!
Don't!
No!
I've got to have you.
I'll take them off myself.
I don't want you to laugh at what you see.
I'm not sexy.
Don't worry.
We're in a hotel room on the 32nd floor.
"If an earthquake hits, we'll die together."
I'm scared.
Moan more.
Is it nice?
Move your hips more.
Hold me tighter.
Shall we go to that hotel that has a revolving bed next?
"Yeah, I've always wanted to go there,"
You know how sexy your voice sounded?
"I liked it,"
Are you comparing me with someone?
Who?
Look at the TV.
- Come on.
Just look.
- l don't want to.
Nami's pussy's sucking my penis in.
I didn't mean to kill him.
I didn't mean it.
He's all right.
I didn't mean to...
He's fine.
"Calm down, be brave!"
- You stay there!
-Jeffrey!
Let's get out of here.
Then you can arrest me.
Let's getJenny out of here.
The car's outside.
Come on!
I won't let you put me behind bars!
Throw the gun down.
You wouldn't kill a cop.
Thankyou.
You could have killed me with one shot.
I don't kill anybody until I know they are the real enemy.
- Do you really know me?
- Fate controls everything.
The only person who really knows me turns out to be a cop.
You could always give yourself up.
No.
I made a promise.
I keep my word.
"Sometimes, I really envy you, your freedom."
It's something I don't have.
"I believe in justice, but nobody trusts me."
I have the same problem.
You're an unusual cop.
And you're an unusual killer.
Everything's near a beach.
"- Okay, then Tallahassee it is."
- Tallahassee it is.
Are you sure?
Is this... what you really want?
What I really want is you.
What is that?
Keeps the time.
(Crow caws)
You have somewhere to be?
"We can mark watches, take turns sleeping."
"We'll most likely have to walk through the night again, so we should rest while we can."
I'll take first shift.
I'll stay up with you.
Okay.
When's the last time you slept?
I don't really sleep now.
Not after what I've been through.
Sleeping curse.
"The one time I did sleep, I had horrible nightmares."
It's a side effect.
Same thing happened to me.
It did?
Mm.
I had them for months.
Charming... my husband... he used to wake me.
"When I cried out, he'd light a candle."
He said it would capture the nightmares.
He'd watch over me as I fell back to sleep.
Sounds like he lives up to his name.
Yeah.
Um... why don't you try... to sleep?
And also I'd like us a decent stove.
This one is covered in fat.
"It'd be nice to have like a white, beautiful place and a decent stove."
It's not a lot to ask.
"Wow, don't look so surprised."
Even a call girl can scramble an egg.
You know what's funny?
I don't think I ever cooked for a guy before.
I mean not even my husband.
Jesus Christ.
Where is he?
Who?
You know who.
- Trevor.
- Don't.
"Jesus, Trevor, what's wrong?"
"This, Ivan."
"He's your ex, isn't he?"
What?
Why is he doing this?
"It's because I'm fucking you, isn't it?"
Now it all makes sense.
"I'm fucking you, so he's fucking me."
Where is he?
"Hiding in the closet, beneath the bed?"
"I don't know what you are talking about, baby."
"Ah, don't baby me."
"Yeah, baby."
I'll change my whole fucking life for you.
"I'll do anything you want, baby."
"You know what, I don't deserve this."
What did you do?
- All right.
OK.
Spare me the lecture.
I already know what you're gonna say so I'm just going to fast forward through all the bull crap that you're about to...
You should be happy for Justin he's your...
Oh.
"I'm so disappointed in you,"
Danny.
Good night.
Let's get high and watch wrestling.
"To be fair, that is what I say first thing in the morning."
"- Danny, Justin's your best friend."
- So?
It's OK to be hurt that he's leaving.
Don't you understand that this is all a ruse on
Justin's behalf?
He's not even really moving out.
Look.
All these boxes are empty.
See?
Oh.
It's all of his khakis.
- I guess he really is moving out.
- Aw.
"Danny, I know how scary it can be to admit how you really feel."
"I mean look how long it took me to admit how I feel about Burski but now I can look you straight in the eyes and I can say ""I love Burski""?"
You don't even realize you said that as a question.
I really do?
I like him.
I do.
OK.
I like him.
"Mate, I'm as happy as a pig in shit."
"No, let's be honest."
It's not working.
"No, let's be honest."
It's not working.
"You're better off trying to run your own outfit, Greg."
"You're better off trying to run your own outfit, Greg."
"I'd rather a 2IC that was 100% happy,"
"I'd rather a 2IC that was 100% happy, not just 90%."
not just 90%.
You know?
You know?
This is what I'm thinking -
"This is what I'm thinking - pay you what I owe you, plus a few extras, pay you what I owe you, plus a few extras, we'll shake hands, part as friends."
"we'll shake hands, part as friends."
What do you say?
What do you say?
What extras?
How's a brand-new car sound?
What extras?
How's a brand-new car sound?
Plus a bag of your favourite scag as a bonus.
Plus a bag of your favourite scag as a bonus.
I could live with that.
I could live with that.
Lennie McPherson?
Lennie McPherson?
I am he.
I am he.
Phil Scott.
I rang you.
Phil Scott.
He's just sabotaging himself.
He's sabotaging this account that would mean so much to us and... I can't even say anything--
"Oh God, Patty."
What would I do?
"I mean, how would I survive?"
"Camille, Camille, it's okay, honey, you're going to be okay."
"No, you don't understand, I need him. I'm not like you."
"Wait, wait, what am I like?"
"I didn't mean that, I just mean I need him, I really need Andy to live."
This is incredible.
Right. I'm sorry that...
H i.
We can go downstairs.
"No, lt's fine. I was just..."
- l should probably go.
- No.
"No, don't go."
"- So, your room is..."
- A mess.
Different from the last time I saw it.
"Okay, well, I'm going."
I'm on hold.
"Rosenfeld, I got to call him back."
Good morning.
How long have you been up?
A while.
You can have the first shower if you want.
"That's okay, you go ahead."
There's nothing edible in here.
"Don't be ridiculous, sweetie."
That things crammed full of stuff.
Let me look.
-Just don't bustin' my balls.
"Hey, Tommy..."
"If I was gonna break your balls, I'd tell ya to ""go home and get your shine box."""
This kid was great.
"I used to call him ""Spitshine Tommy."""
I swear to God.
"Oh, he'd make your shoes look like fuckin' mirrors."
Excuse my language.
He was terrific.
He was the best.
He made a lot of money too.
"Salut, Tommy!"
"No more shines, Billy."
What?
"I said ""No more shines."" Maybe you didn't hear about it..."
You been away a long time.
They didn't go up there and tell you.
I don't shine shoes anymore.
Relax.
What's got into you?
"I'm breaking your balls a little bit, that's all."
I'm only kidding with you.
Sometimes you don't sound like you're kiddin'.
"You know, there's a lot of people around."
"Tommy, I'm only kidding with you."
We're having a party.
I haven't seen you in a long time and you get fucking fresh.
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you."
"I'm sorry, too."
"It's ok, no problem."
"-Alright, salut."
Now go home and get your fucking shine box.
"I mean, what the hell do they want with us?"
They wanna kill us.
Make sure you don't cancel the broadcasts.
Grab that.
Let's go.
Here.
"That's all the information from the laptop, in case..."
"I don't know, in case we don't get out of here."
Drink that.
"""Of course we'll get out of here, Katherine."
"Don't you worry about a thing."""
You ever get used to it?
Used to what?
Bodies.
Dead people.
Seeing them.
No.
They never seem to stay dead.
How's it going over there?
"There's stuff on here, but it's password protected."
"I know, but can you open it?"
I don't know.
I'm trying.
How do we know all this mayhem hasn't already happened?
We don't.
Good.
Just keep working.
Fuck.
Can you just talk to me?
"Yeah, what do you wanna talk about?"
Anything.
Just regular stuff.
Get in.
Where did you go?
"Hey, where did he go?"
Go inside.
Where did Kutty go?
Come here.
Where did you go?
Where did you go?
To pluck guavas.
There are only stones for 12 kms.
Where did you get the guavas?
Tell me the truth.
Where did you go?
I won't tell you.
Tell me.
I won't tell you.
Small boy!
Don't you fear me now?
Konda Reddy says that Singamuthu is in this quarry.
And is insulting me with a camera.
This bastard says that he went to pluck guavas.
Don't you have any fear?
"Until he tells me where he went, he must lie there bleeding."
"If anyone tries to save his life without my knowledge, your children's fate will be very much similar to his."
This is Cuddapah Raja's line of death.
"If anyone treads on it, I will kill him."
"Kutty, where did he go?"
He didn't come for lunch either.
He can't stay hungry.
"Kutty, come fast."
We might miss the bus.
Someone tell me where he is.
Then you whacked your aunt and uncle.
"Shut up, Calum."
I'm just saying.
At least with Lenny you know it's someone who probably deserves it.
Not just some scared kid in a trench.
"I didn't fight in the trenches, Calum."
You wouldn't be going to see your sister if Lenny hadn't got you out of prison.
"Yeah, well, I'm not gonna do it."
OK.
He can find himself another hitman.
I'm sure.
"OK, kids, lunch is ready."
You should get yourself a new map.
Nah.
This is my only school prize.
The names are out of date.
I know.
But the old maps are the best.
The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics that's a brilliant name for a country.
Are you gonna talk to me?
What do you wanna know?
How did you get out so early?
Where you're living now.
What you're planning on doing with your life.
I'm out on licence.
Living in a kind of halfway house.
My life?
"I don't know, Jess, you're gonna have to give me a little bit more time on that one."
Is that it?
Of course it's not it.
I did it for you.
No.
"So, you hated her."
No.
"No, no, no."
"Uh, no, she was a nice person, just sometimes she wasn't nice."
Now we're getting somewhere.
I saw that!
We have several eye witnesses that place you at the scene of the crime and a few hundred of 'em overheard you say you wanted to kill miss Weather.
"No, no, I di- I..."
"Okay, maybe, but I..."
"Look, I just..."
That's not the kind of thing I would ever...
"Okay, look..."
"I know, I know, I know, I gotta stop babbling."
"I gotta- and I gotta stop laughing nervously, right?"
She's going down.
I heard that!
Look you don't know what I'm going through.
You try being pregnant 27/4.
It's confession time.
You did it again!
Hey.
I'm Shaye.
"What are you doing here, Shaye?"
There's no way Corrinda coulda killed Heather.
And I have the footage to prove it.
Shaye.
"Look, I'm not gonna let my baby momma do jail time."
Even if I don't plan to help with the kid at all.
Mm-hm...
"Okay, I'm so mad!"
"I am so mad at her,"
I could just kill Heather Weather right now.
"Would Elisa roast it, just for me?"
If you catch one.
"Come, come here..."
Got you at last!
I caught it!
Help!
I'll show him yet!
"I'm only little, but I'm nifty, see."
"Jean, I discovered something awful!"
We'll write to daddy about your new tooth!
He'll be amazed at you.
When he comes back.
"My little turtle-dove, if it weren't for you..."
So that's the way it is!
That pigeon must be done away with!
Where am I?
What is this?
What have I done to deserve this?
A sword!
"You ugly bird, there..."
I'll get you yet!
Damned bird!
"We'll wring your neck, no more love-notes!"
"Good morning, Elisa."
"Hello, my little devil, have you seen my pigeon?"
"No, let's hope a fox didn't get it!"
Beast!
"I was frightened, where've you been?"
"Good morning, Elisa."
"Did you sleep well, Johann?"
"How else, under one roof with a lovely woman!"
For you I'd sleep on a bare rock!
"I'm telling you, Joe pulled a gun on Patsy."
"A guy like him, self-defense?"
Not a chance.
"- If you killed him, you're out of luck."
- But I didn't kill him.
You're okay.
Better dive in somewhere till you find out for sure.
You gotta get out of the state.
"Mike, find a hideout."
Quick.
For what?
You've got that much head start.
Keep in touch with the hospital.
"When he goes, you start going."
Laying down on me?
You gonna cover me?
Not if he passes out.
"He's living, I can cover you."
Newspapers won't print a word.
They won't look for you.
If he goes-
"- Patsy, I don't have to kid you."
"--you're all washed up, you're through."
"Listen, get across the state line."
Get in touch with Nasetti.
He'll help you find a safe place.
Go ahead.
Okay.
Take your hats off.
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.
Doesn't seem like Sunday without Patsy around.
- Go ahead.
- Short and sweet.
"I want half the money, or i'll have you arrested, and might even do it on the air, live."
- Imagine the ratings.
"- I'd like to see you try, asshole."
- You're gonna see me.
"- I'll kill you, I swear to God!"
- I'm gonna kill you!
- You treacherous little bitch!
You got one week to get your shit together.
- You listening?
I want the money.
- [Door Slams]
Okay.
Okay.
"Okay, let's do a little math."
"You want 20 percent, Dale wants half a million, and Dick wants half of everything."
"I don't have a calculator, but it seems I'm in debt again!"
Dale's money comes out of your share.
He's your friend.
- Not my friend.
He's his friend.
- I hardly know the man.
Who cares?
It's all fucking moot now.
The only thing that's moot to me is the Dick Simmons issue.
"You get a toothache, you pull the tooth."
What does that mean?
- Let's kill the son of a bitch.
"- Oh, God!"
- [Crystal] Yes!
- No!
"Guys pulling out, that's how I ended up with a kid in the first place."
"All right, fine."
I'll do it.
But it's not fair.
You asked me in the middle of sex.
"I was like: ""Uh, uh, uh, uh..."
"fine, I'll take him to Dave  Buster's."""
"Okay guys, quick announcement."
"It's a new year and I wanted to spice things up a little bit, so I decided to dye my hair red and then I chickened out."
Thank God.
Because red hair is the worst.
"However, I did convince Candace to do it."
Yeah!
I love it.
No.
I love it.
It's so good.
It's like a...
like a nice warm bowl of tomato soup.
"If I had a grilled cheese, I would just dunk it on your head."
No I love it.
Like your whole head's on fire.
"I love you, fire-head."
Yeah.
"All right, Brett, I'm going to kill you."
- What do you have against red hair?
- I love redheads.
"When you sleep with them, it's like putting a fire out with your penis."
Just look.
The first time my dad cheated on my mom he was
- dressed as Ronald McDonald.
- What?
"- I love you too, sweetie."
What's up...?
I literally just walked in the door.
What did I do?
You missed her talent show.
"No, I didn't miss it."
"That's, like, next Thursday."
"No, it was last Thursday."
It was on the school calendar.
What did she do?
She was a flag twirler.
That's a talent?
"She practised for like six weeks, John."
She thought you were gonna be there.
It would've been really nice to have a bit of a reminder.
"- Come on, I'm not your secretary, John."
- I'm not asking you to be my secretary.
"Look, I'm just-"
- I'm trying.
I'm trying really hard to be in her life.
"It's a little late for that, wouldn't you say?"
Have a good day.
Are you mad at me?
Just tell me.
Will you be on that all day long?
"""Yes."" Well, that sucks, because, you know, I thought you would want this, but..."
- Lame.
You don't even know what it is.
Do you really think a bribe's gonna work?
Yeah.
I'm hoping so.
"- We're both adults here, John."
"♪ Weaving the good life for you, sugar ♪"
♪ In every way ♪
[sighs]
"So, what can I do for you?"
"Well, I really need to talk to Topher in person."
- I called a bunch of times.
- Yeah.
He didn't know what it was about.
The hotel.
We had a deal.
- Did you?
- Yeah.
I got the good people of Venice to support the hotel development.
You remember.
"Come on, man."
You were there.
"And in exchange, Topher was gonna... well, I think I was gonna get a house."
[chuckles] A house?
Topher promised you a house?
"Well, not in so-- I know that that's what he meant."
"Look, all you did was... placate a community pressure group."
It was just PR.
[faint chiming]
You know what?
Why don't we just call it an even ten thou and we won't darken each other's doors again?
That's not gonna happen.
"Hey, I went to bat for you guys."
Okay?
I betrayed--
I upset a lot of good people who trusted me.
It's not right to do that and get nothing in return.
You owe me.
Are you all right?
Who did it?
This guy who lives across the street from me that I've known all my life.
He started to touch me.
He started to grab me... I told him to stop.
He didn't stop.
I hit him back.
And then he got really angry.
He pushed me out of the car.
You sure you're all right?
Huh?
Why don't you go inside and get yourself together.
Clean up.
"What do you want, fucko?"
"You want some, huh?"
"I swear on my fuckin' mother, if you touch her again, you're dead."
Don't shoot.
Hide this.
Are you all right?
Are you all right?
"I know there are women, like my best friends who would have gotten out of there the minute their boyfriend gave them a gun to hide."
But I didn't.
I got to admit the truth:
It turned me on.
Mazel tov!
Why don't you be like your friend Henry?
He's got a nice girl.
He's settling down now.
He's married.
Pretty soon he'll have a nice family.
And you're still bouncing around from girl to girl.
It was like he had two families.
You'll have to kill him.
Get my diamond before killing him.
I want that diamond at any cost.
Don't worry Bhai.
Have some opium and go to sleep.
I'm hearing a name that scary for the 1st time.
"Time is not good, let's go to the village."
We are in the village.
"Let's go to the city, Car is here."
I will kill him slowly.
Make a bomb.
Which blows.
"Laxminarayan will come, but he won't go back."
Listen to me carefully.
I've seen an old car on the internet.
"How is it, Sir?"
I want to buy this car.
Leave for Pondi now.
Check the car and give 1 lac as advance.
I will mail you the details.
"Which mail, Sir?"
"Sir, Today's Zapack mail comes very quick."
Fool.
I'll fax you from the computer turn on the fax machine.
"There are two fax machines here, which one, Sir."
Left or right?
Left.
Your left or my left?
My left.
"Which position are you in, Sir?"
Can't see on the phone.
This is your last chance.
May I help you?
I'd like to see the inmate Benigno Martin.
"This isn't a visitor's day, but let me see."
"I'm sorry, I can't hear you."
I'm sorry.
This isn't a visitor's day.
"and what's more, the intern hasn't requested a visit."
He doesn't know I'm in Madrid.
I arrived yesterday.
Are you a relative?
"No, I'm a friend."
My name is Marco Zuloaga.
"- May I see your ID, please?"
"- Yes, of course."
Can I phone him?
"You can't phone him, but he can phone you."
My number's changed.
Can you give him the new one?
- Of course.
- Thank you.
Great.
You should remember that visitor's days are Saturday and Sunday.
But it's the intern who has to request the visit.
"If he doesn't want to see you, we can't do anything."
He'll want to see me.
"By the way, we don't have inmates here, we have..."
I can't hear you.
I'm sorry.
"We don't have inmates here, we have interns."
"Good-bye, and thank you."
- 627...
- Wait.
What?
Am I wrong?
honestly?
I don't know.
Take a leak.
"This is bad, my friend."
"I mean, don't get me wrong."
I wouldn't piss on this ralph if he was on fire.
But to whack the guy over a horse?
How fucked up is that?
"If it can happen to him, it can happen to any of us."
What's next?
You get clipped for wearing the wrong shoes?
What can you do?
Tony's the boss.
Centuries of tradition here.
exactly my point.
If Tony did do this... whack ralph over a fucking horse... that guy would be the first guy on Iine to pull his fucking plug.
I think Justin recognized me a few minutes ago.
Thank you.
"Come in, he's getting dressed."
I'II wait in the car.
"well, welcome back."
I bring presents.
really?
That is so sweet.
"also, for the grownups, I bring some of my uncle's wine... but it's come later."
I just made some coffee.
Are you sure?
"Thank you, but I wait in the car."
What's the matter with you?
I'm sad for my father.
And all she wanted was for it to come true.
I bet she would still want it to come true.
She wouldn't want you to give that up.
I know. I just-- l don't think that I can do it without her.
What do you want ?
"Do you wanna do it, Sara ?"
I mean you.
Do you want Juilliard ?
- Yes.
- All right.
"Then, it's on you."
You're the one that's gonna have to make it happen.
You're the one that's gonna have to make the dream come true.
[KeysJingling]
"So, I'll see you tomorrow ?"
Yeah.
I promise not to have a nervous breakdown.
Good night.
Good night.
[Sara] I called Juilliard for an application.
They're holding auditions in Chicago next month.
[Derek] Next month.
That's cool.
"[Sara] I'm out of shape, and it hurts."
"If that's what you call out of shape, what does it take to get you in shape ?"
- Practice.
"- Okay, jog around the room, then."
Do some push-ups.
"I'll sit here, and I'm gonna watch."
That's not how I get into shape.
That's it.
Now shoulders down.
"""To each according to his needs""."
My poor little thing.
Is it love?
My cub...
Love.
I'll show you.
Mommy!
The smell is the proof.
You don't leave a friend wounded in the trenches of old age.
Especially when they're incontinent.
"Here I am, my friend."
"Come on, get down here, you prick."
Do you want me to snatch you by the balls?
Jump off!
And don't fidget!
"Do you remember when, you told me that"
I am doing all this for Mary.
You were right.
"Do you know what a ""lost girl"" means in French?"
Nobody knows any more.
It's a woman that keeps on walking until she falls apart.
You can never help her.
Ever.
You can try to kill yourself.
That's all.
"Yeah, I know."
"You could tell me that I could have nabbed the Munch Bunch at the parking lot, or the villa..."
I'm not God.
I'm just holding his crayon.
That's all.
"one more point, I'm not like the ones you've dealt with at home."
Come on.
"I mean, it was his flute that..."
You've the filthiest mouth!
"Ah, lay off, Kay, will you?"
I'm being harassed!
You just move!
"Look, do you want to keep it?"
What do you mean?
Do you want to...
He wants to know do you want an abortion?
I do not!
There's no way I'm having an abortion!
"Good, you're right!"
You definitely won't tell us who it is?
No!
Sorry.
"Well, there's no more to be said, is there?"
She's obviously made her mind up.
A man needs a pint after all that.
Hang on a second.
"Yes, love?"
Is that all?
What do you mean?
It's a terrible... the neighbors!
Do you care what the neighbors think?
"Yes, I do."
"Sure, the O'Neill young ones are after having kids."
The pair of them.
And the Bells would be the same... except they don't have any daughters... but you know what I mean.
Tara O'Neill had her baby for Paddy Bell.
Of course she did.
So fuck the neighbors.
"You coming for a drink, Sharon?"
Positive.
We'll walk home.
We almost died.
Yeah.
A-about what you said in the car...
Please don't make fun of me right now.
"No, I would never."
It was actually really honest.
And I need to stop taking shots at your intelligence.
You don't do it that often.
"Well, you miss a lot of it."
Oh.
"There, I did it again."
Did what?
"Uh, it doesn't matter."
"I always considered you to be this self-absorbed person, but you're more substantial than that, aren't you?"
Thank you.
You know what?
I'm blowing off Judo today.
Let's hang out.
What should we do?
Makeovers.
Okay.
Great!
We're gonna walk right past my waxing place.
Say goodbye to that gal stache.
Ow.
Ow!
"If it were easy, everyone would be hot."
"Yep, you know, I-it's not just my feet."
It's from when I walked into the stop sign because you wouldn't give me back my...
"Okay, fine."
No it's cool.
What's going on?
"Well, um, Nathan's talking about quitting the team."
"And I just, I don't know what to say."
"Yeah, look I could never find the words to get through that big wall that he puts up so I really can't help you out much."
But you're so much better with him than I ever was.
He's lucky to have you.
Thanks.
I don't want to keep you from your practice.
Hmm.
Go Ravens.
"Hey, um, I didn't mean anything, about your mom."
It's cool.
Okay.
You could have told me Travis was a group.
It's not like it's some big secret.
Lucas gave me the weirdest look when I said that.
I felt so stupid.
You're not stupid.
You guys just don't like the same things.
"See, that's the problem."
He brings up art and books and I've got nothing.
- Hey you.
- Hey you.
And you.
"Welcome back, gentlemen."
Lets see how soft you all got after that little hiatus.
Suicides.
Now.
"Better be a basketball in that thing, Jagielski."
"Come on, Coach."
It's either this or I miss practice.
"Oh, great."
Perfect turns on every track I've ever raced on.
"Sheriff, why don't you go get yourself a quart of oil at Flo's."
I'll keep an eye on him.
"Well, thanks, Doc."
I've been feelin' a quart low.
"This ain't asphalt, son."
This is dirt.
"Oh, great."
What do you want?
You here to gloat?
"You don't have three-wheel brakes, so you got to pitch it hard, break it loose and then just drive it with the throttle."
"Give it too much, you'll be outta the dirt and into the tulips."
"So you're a judge, a doctor and a racing expert."
I'll put it simple.
"If you're goin' hard enough left, you'll find yourself turning' right."
Oh...
Right.
That makes perfect sense.
Turn right to go left!
Yes!
Thank you!
"Or should I say, ""No, thank you""?"
"Because in Opposite World, maybe that really means, ""Thank you""!"
Crazy grandpa car.
What an idiot!
Turn right to go left.
Hmm...
Whoa!
Oh!
Ow!
"Oh, that..."
"Oh, my goodness."
Look at that power.
'The training had paid off.'
Well done!
Look at the speed of this man.
'Sort of...'
"Oh, mate!"
"Are you all right, mate?"
Talk us through it again.
Which one was a professional boxer(?
)
I was in the blue on the floor.
You were in the blue?
Looking ripped.
Yeah.
I look like somebody's made a human out of mashed potato.
JIMMY GUFFAWS
APPLAUSE
I would pay?
40 to see you fight Vladimir Klitschko.
I'd love to see that.
Yeah.
"He didn't like me when we met, either."
Why?
"Ah, I kept on, I said to him, ""If you win..."""
"He went, ""I will win."" I went on, ""If you win..."""
"""I will win."" Then I went,"
"""Isn't there any part of your head telling you you might not?"
"""How are you being that positive?"""
"And he went, ""Don't ask a fighter"
"""a question he can't answer with words."""
"And I tell you, I was that close."
Who are you?
I know what you're doing in this village.
I saw that room.
And I know what the fuck you're doing to my daughter!
"I want you... to stop what you're doing, and leave this village quietly."
I mean it.
Leave.
Quietly.
This is Gokseong.
My turf.
Don't mess around and get yourself killed.
Just leave.
"If you don't leave, you'll die."
"If you heard me, say something."
Or at least nod your fucking head!
Please answer.
"So, you're..."
"Shut up, bitch!"
You're blowing me off?
"Oh, I'm just not worth answering."
Is that it?
"You're not even gonna listen, right?"
Ain't that right?
"I'm trying to speak to you, but you're not listening!"
What's this?
What the fuck is this?
What the hell is all this?
What the...
What the fuck are these rituals you're doing?
!
What the fuck are you doing in my town!
Do you know whose daughter you're messing with?
"They're cops,jody."
What is she doing here?
I called her.
She should know what's going on.
"Well,it's coming out of your profits,bob."
"Wait a minute,jody."
That sisal's expensive.
"You need to calm down,mrs.Carvell."
Calm down?
I just found a dead guy in the living room and I am losing money every day.
"Ohand my father just died of leukemia, so don't you tell me to calm down."
"I'm thinking before we open this up, maybe we should rub some vick's under our noses."
I don't think we'll find a body.
Hope not.
Hate that.
Nothing?
"Well,whatever lance corporal finn was planning on putting in here, he didn't get a chance to."
"Mcgee,give me your flashlight."
You didn't bring your own?
It's too heavy.It pulls my pants down.
Now close the door.
To the right.To the right.
Yeah.
"Just,more to the left.More to the left."
-Okay.
"-Okay,hold it."
Yeah.
too small to hold a body.
Big enough to hold a head.
Is that what I think it is?
"Oh,yes."
Gold.
"I tried to give it to my daughter, but she... threw it back at me."
I think you're about her size.
Could you try it on?
I'll wait in the other room.
Got the bullets.
You'll be surprised how many places I...
What's goin' on?
How do I look?
Ok.
Where did you get it?
He gave it to me.
What for?
"I don't know, Vi."
Can I talk to you a minute?
Have you lost your mind?
- What's your problem?
- You're my problem!
I'll let you borrow it some time if that's what this is about.
It's not about the fucking dress!
"- Yea, right."
- That's exactly right!
"You don't run me, Violet!"
We don't know anybody.
or get involved in stuff or anything like that.
I never went to a prom.
"You did, but I didn't."
- Be glad you didn't!
- Why?
- Because they would laugh at you!
- How do you know?
Because that's what they do if you're different.
"Everybody isn't like that, Vi."
For what?
"You moved on, started a family."
It wasn't that easy for the rest of us.
"Look, Ted, I can't make up for not being around, okay?"
But I'm here now.
It's too late for that.
"I'm done with you, like you were done with all of us."
(crickets chirping)
It's very late.
I didn't hear you come in.
"Well, I wanted to let you sleep."
It didn't go well with the men?
These guys saw hell.
"You know, most of them are still paying the price."
"You feel the effects of war, too, Booth."
Yeah.
"Yeah, but I got lucky."
I got a great family and great life.
Got all this.
"You're an addict, just like Aldo."
Yeah.
"Unlike him, you got help."
Yeah.
But you're in my corner.
That's the difference.
Aldo had no one.
(beeping)
Hey.
"I just, uh, dropped off Jessica."
"And, let me guess, you thought you might check in to see what I'm getting from Tompkins' video doorbell."
Looks like it's rough going.
I thought those things actually worked.
I can't tell.
Uh...
Who is this?
We're her friends.
Do you have a problem with that?
"Yeah, I have a problem with that."
And I have a problem with you looking at me like that.
Who are you to look at me like that?
I don't like him.
Let's go.
Me neither.
Who are you to look at me like that.
"Come on, Kathy."
Bye.
Wait.
I can't.
"Friends are really hard to get, especially when you're pregnant."
I'll talk to you later.
Isn't it harder to get a boyfriend when you're pregnant?
(ALL GIGGLING)
Ben just wants to see his girl.
Ben needs some happiness in his life.
He deserves it.
"I don't feel like letting him pretend to date me, okay?"
I don't like that.
That would be using me to do something that I don't even think he should do.
And Ben's my friend.
He shouldn't ask me to do something I don't want to do.
I've got the harder part.
I have to go over and convince Dylan's parents to let her go out with me.
But I think I'm up to the challenge.
It could be fun.
I don't.
I don't care if we fail.
Failing's fine!
"If we go down in flames, at least there were flames!"
Wow.
"If we're gonna do this, I want to do TV that's bold and thrilling and dangerous!"
I can be dangerous.
I-I can.
You don't seem dangerous.
That's what makes me so dangerous.
I like you.
"I like you, too."
I think you are so much more than you've been allowed to be.
Really?
You need to stop trying to please people.
Can you do that?
If that's what you want.
I don't think she's coming back.
Amazing.
She gave you another chance?
You are an evil genius.
You're too kind.
And you're okay with her getting married again?
Yeah.
Why not?
Your ex-wife ever remarry?
No.
I like to think she exhausted all her misery on me and then left the business.
So I'm guessing you don't miss her.
No.
I do miss my current wife.
"Yeah, you guys are idiots."
"Well, it ain't my fault, is it?"
"If you're worrying about that dame, I'll call her up."
No cracks.
I don't want her to know anything about this or me.
"Yeah, I see."
- Get back to that hospital and find out--
"- Jeez, I've been sleeping in the halls."
Get out of here.
Get back to that hospital.
Stay with him.
Get in bed with him.
- Back.
Move it on those two sides.
- Stay in line.
Move it faster.
Come on.
"Come on, get in here."
Come on.
"Come on, boys, hurry up."
"- Mr. Thompson, look at that."
"- Well, what's the matter with it?"
- Can you eat it?
Those boys can't.
"- Well, they don't have to."
It's worse now than it ever was.
"Miss Griffith, kindly understand that I want no more interference in things that don't concern you."
This does concern me.
We started something.
It was successful.
"Every day, bit by bit, you're tearing it down."
- That will do.
"- No, it won't."
He was in for sex crimes.
Just got released two weeks ago.
Thanks.
Hello.
How are you holding up?
Fantastic.
What's a five-letter word for a cooking utensil?
A whisk?
That would be it.
We're all rooting for you.
I want you to know that.
Thank you.
I appreciate that.
You here to see Johnny Holt?
"Yes, I am."
We found his blood on Vince Nelson's throat.
Holt's a bad dude.
"If he gives you any problems, let me know."
I'll get in there and beat him up for you.
Whisk.
I knew that.
Never seen him before.
There's traces of your blood on him.
My blood's all over this city.
"Been shot nine times, knifed five."
We believe the victim was involved in child pornography.
Do you recognize this boy?
You implying I'm into kids?
Because I sure as hell don't fly that way.
Right.
"Right, you prefer to rape grown women. forgot."
They said it was rape.
"Come on, what are you going to do all by yourself in this gutter?"
"With me, you have a chance!"
You can all rot with her!
"This stare, not for me."
I've got to see Him!
Now I can't see a thing.
Now you can see for real.
"At the end of a regularfilm, I'd go on a killing spree too."
I'd be the hero.
But there are no more heroes.
Just the humiliated.
Stop your bullshit.
Let's walk out of here... barefoot.
"Made off, the rats, welfare!"
"This is the end, my only friend."
I won't have the lake.
There won't be any real revolution.
From now on don't budge!
Hear me?
Watch him.
Save me.
Take me.
Any place you want.
"This film was inspired by ""The Idiot"" by Fedor Dostoevsky."
It is intended as a homage to this great writer.
English Translation:
Daniel Bird and Andrzej Zulawski.
"Morena, get up on the dam."
I want you to deal with the radio room.
Come on!
José should be ready by now.
- I think it's strange.
Do you know how weird that makes me feel?
"A lesbian dream, and he's staring at me like I should include him."
I can't even fantasize in private.
Mom said you've been seeing someone steady.
Is he cute?
- What?
- What are you doing here?
I thought I'd meet you for coffee.
Is that a terrible thing to do?
Excuse me.
I'm going to the ladies' room.
Alone.
Can you believe this weather?
"It's almost April, and it's still cold."
I'm glad I have you alone.
Can I ask you a question?
"It'll sound strange, but..."
Is Claire happy?
"I mean, do you think she's happy?"
"Yes, I think she is."
Why?
I'm being silly.
"I'm a first-time husband, I guess."
"If she doesn't wake up and tell me she's ecstatic, I worry."
"Imagine, I have you to thank for the fact that we're married."
You made this possible.
Knowing you has changed my life.
- Don't do that.
- What?
What am I doing?
"You don't even know, do you?"
Aren't you hungry?
I want to eat something yummy.
Will you treat me?
"Sure, what do you want?"
Something really tasty.
Like spicy rice cakes.
Spicy rice cakes?
Spicy rice cakes?
Don't know if they have it here.
Don't think so.
Do they sell rice cakes here?
"If they do, I can cook it myself."
I'm really good at it.
Really?
Let's check out the grocery store.
Don't go out of your way.
"Don't worry, stupid."
Let's go down to that sand dune.
There's something real neat.
What is it?
I'll show you.
What is it?
"You see, I got the splinter out."
"I didn't get it out myself, and didn't know when it happened."
But I think it was when I bowed on my knees.
You went down on your knees?
"Yeah, I think that's when the splinter got out."
Why did you bow?
Come on and see.
"You'll feel like doing it, too."
Why are you laughing?
"Alright, let's go."
So j... give me your skates.
What?
Why?
"You've dragged me so far, we're closer to my office than we are to the car."
Take 'em off!
He just wasn't ready.
But me?
I had a message for the small stuff that used to rule my life.
"Hey, Phil."
"Honey, how you holding up?"
Good.
"So, I'm at the beach..."
Long story.
"Anyway, I was hoping you wouldn't mind waiting at the house for Luke's tutor."
"Actually, I would mind."
I'd mind quite a bit.
I'm kind of busy.
"Okay, great."
"Suck it, small stuff."
Why are we stopping?
"For many, a near-miss with death is a wake-up call."
"But when a man misses his own near-miss, he truly sees what he's been missing."
No more putting my dreams on hold.
"Five years ago, I made a bucket list."
It was time to start crossing things off.
Scariest moment of my life.
Ohh.
"Oh, my gosh."
I thought I lost you!
"But amazingly, something great came out of it."
I found out how my sister truly feels about me.
"Girls, are you sure?"
"I think about my father, about my mother."
I'm searching in the mud.
- Don't you want to look at me?
- It's difficult.
Tough day?
Was it easier with the gangster's woman?
It was just a reflex.
She loved me.
So one has to be in love to reflect?
It's better for the other one.
- The neighbor?
- Up above.
Do you mean God?
Could it be just the two of us for two minutes?
It'd be too sad.
"But everything's sad, open your eyes!"
I can't see.
"I can see into, but not..."
"And how am I, into?"
Young.
Would you like to visit?
"I can be just as cheap a tart as your tramp, you know!"
No you can't.
You enjoy that?
"You really are fucked up, friend of a friend!"
It's André!
"André, meet my friend of a friend, Léo."
André is a man on the move.
"He's moving in Mom, who's moving him up."
"Forget sweet talk, when it comes to whoring, I'm his bet."
"""But once in America, what will we do?"
"""Monsieur de la Fayette will provide you with instructions!"""
I wanna hear what she has to say.
"Bloody Mary, shadows have power, I get it."
But what if that's not just a shadow?
That look on her face is somebody who's trapped.
"Believe me, I know that look and so do you."
"If things get hinky, you can pull the plug."
What do you got to lose?
I do need to do this.
"Wait, wait!"
Let me think!
Where are you?
So Mr. Whitman doesn't look good.
- No sign of any artifact.
- Not even a glimmer.
- What's up with his hand?
- I don't know.
"If you want to get rest, I'll stay with them."
- Not if they split up.
- I'll call you.
"No, no."
Let's...
Let's stay together.
"If they've got something, it's on 'em."
I want to know what it is.
I've been burned by this before.
They look real and they'll say anything.
Say something.
"Artie, when I get out of here, I'm hugging her and"
I'm kicking your ass.
"Yeah, well, that won't be happening."
Why?
"- Artie, it's me."
And why things happen this way and not the other.
I think there's no much use in talking about what happened already.
Probably...
You're always trying to explain people what happens to them.
Instead of looking to yourself.
"Once, I was thinking of you.."
And then I got sad.
Then I'm not funny always.
You never put any effort in a better living.
"For example, you say you like living in the field."
Then why don't you move here?
Would you come with me?
Why do you say that?
I'm saying if you'd live here with me.
I don't know.
I told you I may not like the idea.
What does that mean to what we were talking?
Do you love me Sara?
And what did that come from?
I'm asking you.
How I couldn't love you.
You're my father!
And if I weren't?
Imagine for a moment that I weren't.
What a nonsense!
What do I know?
Could you give me a cigarette?
I'm going to bed.
We had a long ride.
Good night.
Bye.
Good night.
"Dale, Baby."
What you do here?
Wow let me guess...
Baby's mama?
Did you just call me a baby?
Baby she didn't just call me a baby now did she?
What?
Don't screw with me slut!
Excuse me?
You don't know her do you JP?
Yeah baby.
This is Dale.
Not anymore you don't.
Bye bye.
This is my first bitch slap but seeing the look on her Botoxed face.
You deserve him!
"Totally makes it worth it,"
I like!
And he's going to put me in his next movie.
But isn't he kind of old?
Aren't you going to have to you know...
Do him?
Probably.
Oh God!
If I have to stand here and listen to this bimbo yap about the blowjob she'll have to give to get a movie part.
I'll pee in my pants.
Um excuse me...
We're in line.
"Um, actually you're at the mirror which doesn't really constitute the line."
Well just go... fine.
I'll give you my number and then you know maybe we can hang out sometime?
You gonna give me your number?
Now.
"I can't, sweetheart, we've got a plane to catch."
"Oh, every time we're close, I feel something good is about to happen."
You've got to be...
You said you didn't want to see my face or hear my voice.
I can't think in there.
"Well, it wasn't my voice."
I thought you'd keep him in check.
I thought I could depend on you.
"- Well, Cari told Bob..."
- That she's going to Brazil...
Please.
"Jon, please."
I'm two cases short.
What?
You gotta be kidding.
You know that baby food was on the way to the lab.
It was contaminated with botulism.
I know.
I probably lost them when I got this.
I gotta make a phone call.
Four were crouched behind their car.
"It was just me and my bike against four men, two. 45s and two sawed-offs."
"I pulled my gun, grabbed my mike and called for backup."
Then they opened fire.
I was hit by a bullet.
"Oh, I hurt real bad."
I went down.
I got up and I got hit on this side...
"Oh, you girls..."
I was speaking very low.
Baker.
What do you say?
Sit down.
"- How they treating you, Rocky?"
- Like a prince.
I get three square meals and real butter on my bread.
What a life.
- Is that a bad cut on your eye?
- Not bad.
Just a few stitches.
I thought you knocked your eye out.
You coming to my trial tomorrow?
"Rocky, I've been worrying about this all last night."
- I can't let you take the whole blame.
"- Pipe down, want the flapper to hear?"
Now get this.
"You got away, didn't you?"
Okay.
I wanna be a sucker.
"But, Rocky, maybe if they thought I was in on it, they'd go easier on you."
In a pig's eye.
"Just because you can run faster, you don't gotta eat yourself."
"- But it ain't fair to you, Rocky."
"- Look, so they send me up."
So what?
What've I got to lose?
The old man's got troubles enough without me.
Forget it.
"I got caught, and you got away."
"But you, Rocky."
"Supposing I was the one who got caught, you wouldn't keep quiet."
- You'd make them send you up too.
- What do you think I am?
Is the bar open?
I mean can I get a decent cup of coffee?
Now that's a classic portrait.
What do you think Angie?
I'm not a fan of black and white photos.
I had a black and white photo taken of me as well.
I looked really great.
"Just fabulous, like a film star."
But I don't look like that at all.
Exactly.
That's why I like black and white photos.
So you lie to yourself quite a bit.
Right?
I think you are beautiful.
- Hi.
"Angie, clean up back there!"
"One thing after another, boss."
"This one is good too, by the way."
"Right, quite good."
"Okay, I'll take that."
You want to buy me a drink?
Why not?
Thank you for the sign.
Now go to your brother and pull the money off the wall.
Go fuck yourself Toni.
"You could stay outside as well, or sit in the lobby and drink tap water."
- Can we get a coffee here?
Sure.
Two coffees?
- Black.
Me too.
Thank you.
"All right, y'all, it's almost time for the mele, the Kanikapila luau drum show!"
The special blend.
"Yes, this is a magical drink."
You know what?
I'm gonna go get a good spot for the show.
Do you guys wanna come?
"No, no, we're good here."
Okay.
You're fine?
Okay.
And then there was two.
"Listen, I want you to come back with me."
I'm not going back to the other side with you.
"I'm gonna stay right here, get my celebration on and get another margarita made up in my face."
I came a long way to find you.
"Well, I know you ain't come to get a drink."
You damn sure ain't come to dance.
So what'd you follow me here for?
No.
I did.
"I came here to drink, party, scratch records, do it all!"
Do it...
It's just...
Just...
Just...
You know?
What am I saying?
I don't want to do any of those things.
Truth is that I'm exhausted just saying them.
"All right, y'all, it's time for the Kanikapila luau drum show!"
"Cynthia, hi."
Excuse me.
Just pass me the bill.
Okay!
Sir Wong is looking for you.
What's wrong with you?
You used my money to solve a kidnap case.
You saved the guy but my money is gone.
Now my money is strewn all over the streets.
Isn't that too much?
Capturing the baddies at all cost.
"Bro, you think I'm the richest man in HK?"
"I'm not your bro, Mr. Mak."
I'm your son.
Are there other cops like you?
Using money to work?
You're too busy to spend your money.
Treat it as a good cause.
You think I'm a charity?
Fine...
You only call when I spend your money.
Meet and scold me in person.
Isn't that more satisfying?
I'm always free to meet you.
I never wanted you to be a cop.
"I warn you, I'll freeze your account."
Excuse me...
Where's the resource room?
You can't buy style.
Shit!
We've the same tie!
"I asked for resource room, not fashion advice."
"No resource room, evidence room is ahead."
Thank you.
All I know is how to sit down and order a meal.
Not for you.
Just a place to hang.
The chef is great.
The fuckin'shows are good.
There's a lot of whores coming in.
What do you want from me?
Tommy's a bad seed.
What am I supposed to do?
Shoot him?
That wouldn't be a bad idea.
I'm sorry I said that. I didn't mean to say that.
I just mean that he's scaring me.
I just need help.
"Help me, please."
You know anything about this fuckin' restaurant business?
He knows everything about it.
He's in the joint 24 hours a day.
"Another fucking few minutes, he could be a stool."
That's how often he's in there.
You want me to be your partner?
is that what you're tryin' to tell me?
You want me to be partners?
What do you think I'm talking about?
"Paulie, please."
It's not even fair.
You don't understand.
You run the joint.
Maybe I'll try to help you.
"God bless you, Paulie."
You've always been fair with me.
Now the guy's got Paulie as a partner.
"-Yeah, right."
-What?
-Joey cracks me up.
"""Have your ex-wife move in."
"That wouldn't be awkward."""
"Imagine, I go away for a few days.."
and my boyfriend is living with a woman he got pregnant.
"So, what'd you tell him?"
You didn't tell Mona Rachel moved in?
She seemed to think it was such a crazy idea.
"Plus, she got me taffy."
-Really?
I've never had any.
-Ever?
My mom was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats.
Thank you.
Are you gonna tell her?
I will.
I want to butter her up first.
"I'm gonna take her to dinner, do all this romantic stuff."
When she thinks I'm the best boyfriend ever..
I'll tell her my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me.
"If I haven't said it before, she's a lucky, lucky lady."
So where are..?
What the crap is up with this stuff?
Is it gum?
Is it food?
What's the deal?
"Oh, it's nice."
May I try a pink one?
So I just have to plan the perfect night.
"Hey, what's the best date you ever had?"
Drop the weapon!
It's over!
Aah!
Aah!
Get away from me!
"Trevor, you don't want to do this."
Let me help you or you're gonna die.
You help me?
"Yeah, right!"
I know about Preston.
I know that he put you up to all of this.
You damn half-breed!
You don't know anything!
"Trevor, we pulled your phone records."
You called Preston 13 times today.
So what?
!
"We pulled his voicemail messages, too."
"He's using you, kid."
That's why he won't call you back.
Get out of here or I'll kill this bitch!
Listen to me.
Just listen.
"When those men broke in your house, you know who ended up buying it?"
It was your man Preston.
And he got it for nothing.
You're a liar!
All you people do is you lie!
"The men convicted of killing your family, they both said somebody paid them off to do that job."
They just couldn't prove it.
So now they're doing life.
"Yeah, well, they should have gotten the chair!"
No more mummy wife from now on.
Your eyebrows are going to be attached to here soon.
Then you'll be a monster.
"I'm warning you, this is really the end."
I feel like death.
"When you're sleeping next to a mummy, you yourself feel like you're dead."
Do you know how scary it is to see a mummy moving around at night?
Do you have nothing else to talk about?
I'm only saying it because it's us three.
Why are you still wearing that?
Is there still some bruising?
People will find out.
Stop it.
And the kids?
"They're here, they wanted to take a look at some things."
My husband's almost here as well.
The guest has arrived.
I'm not late.
I'm five minutes early.
I just got here as well.
Hello.
Hello.
Take that off.
"Right, shall I?"
Why is it so hot?
I'll be taking this off.
Sure.
She's got a sty in her eye.
She didn't want you to see it so she got surgery.
Oh...
This color!
"Oppa, pretty, right?"
Take a shower.
They're gonna be here soon.
You need to clean the grill.
"Why can't we just stay in, just the two of us, and just not do that?"
"You mean like when I'm up and I am doing things, and you're asleep?"
Let's save that for another afternoon.
Get up.
The joke's on you.
I'm not a ventriloquist dummy.
- That's all right.
- It's all right.
It's all right.
- You could use that in your act.
- I could.
You want cheese?
- Cheeseburger.
Cheeseburger.
- It's funny.
Can I do it?
Do you mind if I...?
I just don't need everybody touching my cheese.
Just...
No.
This will be mine.
- I'll have cheese.
No cheese for this guy.
- I can't have dairy.
I'm taking this cooking class where we're learning how to make a curry carrot corn queso.
It's like a dip.
"It's for Christmas and couples, or you can put it on salad."
- Was it sponsored by the letter C?
- Ha-ha-ha.
No chicks.
"Yeah, like you'd know what to do with one, you virgin!"
I know more than you!
Are you forgetting about that fox at the lake I boned all last summer?
How come we never met her?
I told you she died of leukemia.
Last time you said it was polio.
"Polio is a gateway disease to leukemia, stupid."
"Hey, look, Claire's here."
"Oh, she's so fine."
"Why don't you fuck her, Kevin?"
I blew my shot with her.
She was just about to touch it when my stupid brother boner-blocked me.
I'll never get laid.
"Hey, you know, I heard about this loose girl that goes to Roberto Clemente High."
She asks you to come to her house for a free haircut.
And then she fucks you.
"Well, that's something."
What's her name?
- I don't know.
Haircut Girl?
- That's no help!
"Oh, fuck it."
I'm gonna go talk to Claire.
"- No, you're not."
"- Oh, yeah?"
Watch me.
I will not die a virgin.
Ow!
My dick!
"Goddamn it, Maureen."
Don't sit like that.
- Malaysia.
I was in the area.
- Kramer.
- Just drive.
All right.
"Now you listen, and you listen good."
I know who you are.
You're the scofflaw.
- What are you talking about?
- Don't play dumb.
"It's me, Cosmo."
"All right, so it's me."
So what?
You don't think I know how you're feeling every second of the day?
Looking over your shoulder to see if someone's coming up sitting alone at night knowing they could be closing in.
"- I can't sleep, I tell you."
I can't sleep.
"- Of course you can't, you poor sap."
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I couldn't.
I couldn't tell anyone.
So you've been living this secret by yourself?
- It's been awful.
- Yeah.
I wanted to tell somebody.
"- Help me, Kramer."
Help me.
"- All right, I'm gonna help you."
"I'll try some on, we'll see how they look."
It's just hair.
Ever see what that looks like in the back?
You got natural curls on the bottom and that big phoney mat coming down on top of it.
Then the next thing I knew he had me pinned up against the wall.
It's OK.
Take your time.
He said he had a knife.
"And that if I didn't do what he wanted, he'd kill me."
And he told me to open the door.
And...
I was so scared I couldn't find my keys.
"You're doing really well, Lucy."
He got really angry and... he ripped the back of my dress.
With a knife.
And... he started touching me.
This car horn started beeping.
And he just grabbed my bag and ran off.
And...
I heard the cab pull away.
Can you describe the cab?
"It was green, I think."
Maybe blue.
Did you see his face?
Only for a second or two.
Anything else you can remember at all?
Something that sticks in your mind?
He had these trainers on.
They were white with a blue stripe.
And one of them had orange paint splashed on the toe.
It was on the right foot.
OK.
You've done really well.
"Thank you, Lucy."
"Right, if you'll excuse us."
Looks like the fiance is off the hook.
I'm not him.
"Uh, I know that, Aubrey."
(chuckles anxiously)
"He left his wife, he left me."
"You know, I would-- I would never ever do that."
What are you saying?
"I'm saying that... when I commit to something, it's real."
That I'm serious about us.
Did I say the wrong thing?
No.
"Of course not, Aubrey... (sighs) ...but there's a lot going on."
I know.
"And when it's all taken care of,"
I'm gonna feel the same way.
BRENNAN:
"I know this is difficult, Booth, but... (groans) ...you're gonna get through it."
"Yeah, sounds like something Aldo would have said."
He was right.
(Booth groans)
"Yeah, but this is different."
"Bones, he, um... he died... 'cause he was trying to protect me."
What do you mean?
You know that X-ray that we saw in the sound studio?
I know who that was.
There was no name on it.
I looked for that.
He died of a gunshot wound in the head.
Center core.
"3,000 feet away."
I'm the one who made that shot.
That is a ridiculous assumption.
There are other snipers capable...
- She looks mad.
"No, that's just her look."
What's that?
"- ""It looks like her number came up."""
- It's a zinger.
She's a lotto girl.
Her number came up.
Get it?
"You remember last year sergeant Beecham shoved that junkie into a lamp post, and he said, ""i'll keep you posted."""
- I heard about that.
- Everybody heard about it.
"I mean, people were repeating it."
It was famous.
This is even better.
- This is a classic.
- If you say so.
"Yeah, I just need to find the right moment."
"Captain, if you're ready to release the body, I can take her downtown."
I still don't get it.
Who'd want to kill the Lotto girl?
I guess her number came up.
"- Hey, what are you doing?"
"- Hey, what are you doing?"
"- That was my line, man."
- What are you talking about?
I just said the exact same thing two seconds...
Ask the captain.
"- This is a crime scene, for god sakes."
"- No, you heard me."
You know what?
He must've heard me.
"It's okay, look."
You want to take a swing?
Do it.
Nothing would make me happier.
Just want you to move your truck.
What was I thinking?
"You only beat women, right?"
Listen...
"You're not paying for a double, and even if you... even if you were, it wouldn't include Crazy Horse over there."
That's a whole other deal entirely.
- I'm trying...
- You're not trying hard enough.
"Get rid of him soon, or this doesn't happen."
He left New Haven an hour ago.
He'll be here.
"Yeah, well, I'm just saying."
"No, you're just worrying."
Hmm.
Where else is he going to go
- with a Geiger counter?
- Huh.
[phone rings]
"Hi, Julia."
I did what you asked.
I got him to the restaurant and made sure he was facing the door.
Thank you.
"Look, I know how tough this is for you."
Tough?
This is...
This is tough?
"No matter how this goes down, I lose."
"You get that, don't you?"
"If you're right, the father of my son is nothing better than a con man."
I can't afford to run down the boss's daughter.
Why don't I pack us a picnic lunch?
This is the kind of a day to play hooky.
I've already thought of that.
Good.
But I'm on my way to pick up Nancy.
"There was a washout last night, and the train's been stalled about five miles out of town."
Oh.
"Well, I guess a big railroad like that can get her here safely."
"Probably, but I..."
I did promise to pick her up.
"All right, I'll go with you."
"No, but I promised her, I..."
Unless I'm in the way.
"Oh, no."
"No, you're not in the way."
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)
What happened in Los Angeles?
"I saw Colonel Blair, and he thinks I should get my papers in a week or so."
I know Karen Blair quite well.
Perhaps I can speed up your orders?
That'd be wonderful.
Don't mention it.
Beautiful tune.
"The words are pretty, too."
Do you know them?
I think so.
* Love is all that matters
* And we've got love
* We have walked off with a prize
* The stars that I used to see
* Are not where they used to be
Your petticoat's showing.
Ek Number!
All's well!
Do Number!
All's well!
Teen Number!
All's well!
Chaar Number!
All's well!
Paanch Number!
All's well!
Swing those picks there.
You think this is a strawberry festival?
Shake a leg with that pole.
"Come on, get it up there at the double."
This is a fine time for things to go quiet.
Blast them Thugs.
Why don't they come and give us a good fight?
Then Bal will be a pipe to re-enlist.
"Come on, hurry up, I told you."
How can we get a nice little war going?
What if I were to blow up the Taj Mahal or one of them sacred tombs?
"What do you want to do, start the Indian Mutiny again?"
"Annie, get your back into it!"
Hurry up!
He's even snarling at poor little Annie.
"You can't work 24 hours a day, you know."
"In another 24 hours, my time will be up."
I don't want to leave anything undone that might detain me.
"Get it up, hurry up."
He's tired.
It just goes to show you what a piece of dry goods will do.
Whatever's happening to you penguins... don't blame it on me.
I'm not.
But you can help save them.
"Listen, fella, you look after your kind, and I'll look after mine."
"If I thought like that, I would have left you in that hole."
"That's it, I'm claiming a forfeit."
Get off my beach!
"Wayne, now I'm really gonna hurt you."
I saved your life!
And I'm gonna save yours.
Take your furball and fluff off... or I'm gonna turn carnivore... with a craving for penguin.
- But...
"- The only ""butt"" I wanna see is yours... walking away."
"Come on, son."
We're wasting precious time.
There's nothing for us here.
"Now, where was I?"
- Right here.
"- Oh, yeah."
- What are you looking at?
- What are you?
BRYAN:
"I don't know, but it sure is ugly."
ERIK:
"No, Pa."
This is so unfair.
[SINGING] After all you have done.
You really deserve better.
Nothing makes sense in this world.
It's all a big pile of crazy.
And the kings are all fools.
BRYAN:
Come on!
Teach me.
Are you afraid?
You're right.
Because they're all dead.
All my teachers.
-What time is it?
-What?
We go to the club.
"We go to the club, we'll dance."
"There's nothing else to do, we might as well dance."
"Come on let's go, let's go."
-Are you looking for Adrian?
"-Adrian is dead, it's every man for himself."
"I'm delighted to see you, you don't know how it thrills me."
-You're glad?
-Sure I'm baby you're the man.
I love your sexy body.
-You're freaky.
"-Sure I'm baby, freaky for you."
Let's go to my place.
Come on.
Well now that we've had dinner and coffee and everything...
Why don't you take off your jacket and make yourself at home.
I really should update my notes.
"You're absolutely right, now is ""the"" perfect time."
This is gonna be the fuck of your lifetime.
-I got some coke.
-I don't care about that.
I just want you...now.
"Orgasms, wasn't that the subject we were discussing?"
I think that right now I should study the alien.
Whoever took that wallet was about the most stupid sneak thief in the world.
Why do you say that?
Because the risks are to great and the reward is too small.
"I always say that if you're going to steal at all, steal in a way that will be admired."
"Let's get out of here, hm?"
Where will we go?
Anywhere.
I know the perfect place.
First time I've ever been in a subway.
What a fascinating experience.
Everybody who comes here wants to ride in the subway.
You'll get over it.
"Say, what about those abc's you were telling me about?"
We'll get to that.
This is where I live.
What kind of a district is this?
See for yourself.
You know Park Avenue is only three blocks away?
But I'll never make it.
"You know, I think I'm gonna like you."
You won't tire my mind.
I might wear it out my way.
Go on in.
It's safe.
Thanks.
Fix yourself a drink.
Fix me one too.
What'll you have?
Bourbon.
How?
Straight.
Okay.
You're a good man?
You like to hit women.
You like to hit children.
"That doesn't make you good and it sure as hell doesn't make you a man, so stop talking."
"Okay, I'm..."
I'm a good man.
"And if you say one more word, I might have to show you what this good man does to people like you."
"Dr. Bennett, you might want to rein in that charming bedside manner."
"Trust me, I was reining it in."
He's seizing.
Darren?
I need suction and an airway now.
Your incision is healing well.
"Just keep the area, you know, clean and dry."
Okay.
Anything else?
No.
Yes.
Um... you should probably get some light exercise.
Just go walk around the block or something.
"You know, just get out."
Wow.
"Your... your lips are moving, but your words sound just like Pete's."
"You were in the closet, Violet."
"Look, I'm..."
I'm doing the best I can.
"No, I know you are."
I do.
"Oh, look at that smile."
That's gas.
Sorry to tell you.
"No, it is not gas."
And now she's in the wind.
Kiddo.
Listen.
Go back to those twins.
They're your family now.
This was a bad idea.
So...
You.
Here.
This is what?
You giving up on working with your son?
Duval doesn't care what I think about this case or anything else.
You can't really believe that.
Your son wants very badly to please you.
Why do you think he became an FBI agent?
You don't follow in the footsteps of someone whose opinion doesn't matter.
You matter to him.
I never thought of that before.
He got into law enforcement because of me.
He wanted to please me. [Chuckles]
"His whole life, he just wanted to please me."
If he's her and I'm him...
Why am I here?
Because you want me to shut up.
Okay.
I'm good with that.
"No, no, no, no, no."
You want me to shut up.
You really want me to shut up.
And yet you still keep on talking.
Not now.
"I mean, probably now, but even when I was dead, did you ever hear me then?"
No.
"No, i guess it's just time for me to get out."
Nick.
"Jim, don't let him go!"
"If you're doing this for me, it's wrong!"
Don't worry.
He'll be back tomorrow.
"Just come from the gold exchange, boss."
It's buzzing over there like a hornet's nest.
"You know, i'm going to put a scare into washington till they padlock that treasury."
"There she goes, up again."
"You know, gold's jumped 4 points since you started buying it."
Jim.
"Oh, josie!"
You're just in time to see the fireworks start.
"Jim, where's nick?"
"In his office, i guess."
Haven't you seen him yet?
I've been waiting all day for him to come through that door.
It's not so far to come.
"But it's not so far to go, either."
"I'm sorry, josie, i can't do it."
"Please, boss."
"Jim, you've got to do it."
Do it for my sake.
"Hello, nick."
"Hello, jim."
Gold's just hit 125.
It's not too late if you still want to come in.
It's not too late for you to get out.
"Stop fooling with gunpowder, jim."
I won't stop until it hits 200.
"Jeeves, you don't mean you're leaving me still."
How are we gonna manage?
"The young lady may have some idea, sir."
I hear they generally have.
That's right.
I hadn't thought of that.
- Shall I have a go at it till the blacksmith arrives?
"- Yes, please."
"- Thank you, sir."
"- Thank you, Jeeves."
"Go on, take a card, any card at all."
Now look at it.
Put it back.
Ace of spades.
"- When did you change the act, Pop?"
- I didn't.
He did.
He did?
"Yes, he said straight magic is too old-fashioned."
"Wait a minute, take a bow."
"No, you take it."
I got to get married.
"Come here, they're applauding you."
They like it.
Lucky.
Now what?
"- I want to reason with you, if I can."
- But you already did.
Have you really made up your mind to leave me... just to marry some girl you happen to know?
"It's kind of customary to know the bride, isn't it?"
I hate to see you leave show business.
How?
I killed the people that fucked me.
"That's it, if you fuck me you'll die."
"Come on, baby!"
"No, it's true!"
It's not true.
I'm serious.
I'm serious too.
Hey you!
How many people want me see me fuck Margaret and not die?
It's too much Adrian
Lay off!
There's something very strange going on here.
I'm going to leave.
Right there's something strange going on here.
I bet you 300$ that I can fuck Margaret and not die.
Of course she won't die.
But I'm not sure watching you fuck is worth 300$.
But it sure sounds interesting.
I'd like to watch but I'm not sure Margaret's in the mood.
Adrian!
"You should stay away from me, I'm a killer."
"You like to fuck, baby, better than anything in the world."
I don't want you!
Why not?
Because I'm killing all the people that I fuck.
"You kill me bitch, that's the joke of all time."
Adrian...
Leave me alone.
You like it honey?
You like it...
"Don't do it, Adrian."
- Hey.
- Hey.
"I don't know whose day's been worse, yours or mine."
- You okay?
- Yeah.
You?
I never thought I'd see something like that.
It's different when they roll in on a gurney.
"Yeah, but you stepped up."
That's all that counts.
I did my job.
At least we saved one of them.
- So I heard she gave an ID.
- Partial one.
I filled in some details.
"What, you saw the guys?"
A glimpse as they drove off.
"- They were black, huh?"
- I think so.
You think so?
"Well, it was quick, you know?"
But- And I only saw one of them.
So that's why the cops are picking up brothers all over town.
I told them what I saw.
"What you saw, or what you thought you saw?"
"I was trying to help, Greg."
Can't you see you fed right into what they always wanna jump to?
"Look, I'm really sorry for what happened to you, but that's on the cops, not me."
It's all part of the same thing.
What are you talking about?
- I don't know.
"- So, what, now I'm a racist?"
It took me a year and a half.
It wasn't until he tried to hit my baby Stevie that I left.
A year and a half?
You leave your brains in a box somewhere?
He loved me.
Oh.
He told me so.
He just hit me 'cause I'm ugly.
You're not ugly.
You got a place to stay?
Yeah.
I found a cheap motel across from the airport.
"Cheapest place I could get, but... two or three nights working here, I think I can get a good place, move out of there."
And what if that bruiser comes looking for you?
He won't.
I talked to God at Kennedy Airport in New York before I left.
He told me that I have to live for my baby.
So I told him that I would kill anybody who tried to hurt me like that.
I don't think God is going to let Danny come near me again.
Dorothy?
Yeah?
I don't think it's gonna work out for you here.
I'm gonna have to let you go.
What?
I'm sorry.
It's just the way things worked out.
Help me.
What are you worried about?
I've known Frank Doss and Mr. Cannata for years.
"I'll speak to them, I'll explain things...."
It's gonna be all right.
Thank you.
Inter-planetary.
"So take him, Stanin."
"Look, tell me, do you love me?"
"Look, do you hear?"
Will you write to me?
"Tell me, do you love me?"
Will you write to me?
Manya?
Let's beat it!
Look...
We're just naturally loose!
"We can't broadcast this to our planet, nobody would believe it."
And why not?
"Because if they get to know this on our planet, then everyone will want to fly here."
And we don't have enough flying saucers for this.
It would be the end of our civilization.
You get it?
Hallo.
Hallo!
What do you think?
Should I write to her?
Don't pick it up!
What will you report to them?
This just isn't possible.
I'll adjust the message a bit so it won't be so shocking.
What do you think about this?
-No.
It's concealing facts.
-I know.
But it will be better this way.
Believe me.
I'll only a little bit more...
"We saved her, too."
My God.
Your brother.
"This time, the governor won't have Serena to use as P.R."
He won't have to die.
We did it.
We sure did.
My husband must be sending out a search party by now.
I left my car at the hospital.
Will you take me?
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey."
Friends don't let friends drive in a state of shock.
I'll drive you home.
They stopped looking for me.
They stopped looking for me.
They stopped looking for me.
Does this have anything to do with Ruby?
"No, it's..."
It's the police.
That's who's supposed to look for guys like... him.
Seat belt's stuck.
- Thanks for the ride.
"- Hold on, wait."
- I'll walk you.
- That's okay.
"If I let a girl walk herself to the door on a dark night,"
I'd have to commit ritual suicide.
"You don't want my death on your conscience, do you?"
Or your blood on my sidewalk.
Yeah.
"Well, hold on, hold on."
I want Pete back.
"I want it in writing that Jenna's job is safe, and I want a cappuccino machine for the writers' room."
Fine.
I thought you were going to quit.
"Yeah, well, you don't know everything about me."
You weigh 127 pounds.
Yeah.
"Thank you, good night."
You will be hearing from Peanut's lawyer.
"Good night, sleep tight."
I can't wait to do this with you every week.
[Horn honking]
Hello?
Excuse me?
"There's a line, buddy."
There's two lines.
"No, no, there's one line."
We're in it.
I'm just getting a hot dog.
We're all getting hot dogs.
"What, do you think there's two lines and we're all in this line and you're the only genius that got in the other line?"
You believe this guy?
Don't line up behind him.
He cheated you.
"Hey, shut up."
"Now I want all the hot dogs, please."
"Yeah, I'm buying all the hot dogs."
You don't have to do that.
"No, no, no, You don't have to do that."
That is ridiculous.
And I'm giving them to the good people.
Are you going to clean it?
The Blue Diamond Hotel is right beside it.
I want to go there.
Do you see that bufalow?
"Yes, On the right."
Follow it.
It takes bath everyday in it.
What Madam?
You're just wasting time.
There's nothing in my bag.
I can see that you're a riot without a weapon.
"Show me the bag, okay go ahead."
See this is a pant.
And this is my Gun!
Where did that come from?
Put the gun down and surrender.
Yes I'll put it down but first let me think where it came from?
Give me the gun or...
I'll beat you so bad.
No Madam don't come forward.
A stupid fool like you will shoot me!
You're scaring a Jatni with spray.
"Ma'am this is my gun, actually the holi is coming that's why."
But when I saw your physique I got scared and...
I hid the gun in his bag.
Let him go.
Please Ma'am.
Let him go!
Gentleman is telling me to let him go.
Let him go.
You'll have to file an application for it.
"I obliged you, Aren't you going to oblige me?"
Maybe Caleb is the same.
It's only Hanna.
I wasn't asking who you were on the phone with.
Do you want the last bit of cobbler?
I can just bring it up for you.
"No, thanks."
Okay.
"- What do you mean, ""only Hanna""?"
- It's my mom.
Things are still sub-zero around here.
Did you tell her about Paige's dad?
No point.
She'll say it's my fault for choosing a disgusting lifestyle.
Paige is such a knob.
- I don't think it's all her fault.
- What do you mean?
What's going on between you and Aria?
It's nothing you have to worry about.
You were snarking at each other like you were on a reality show.
The Real Teens of Rosewood.
"Oh, tell me about Toby."
He says we have what he wanted us to have.
"It's the right message, I'm just reading it wrong."
He wants me to come to his house Saturday.
Are you going?
"If I don't, how are we gonna figure this out?"
I'm shut out with Melissa and lan.
- Where are you?
- What do you mean?
I'm right here.
Any fire truck you can hear at your house I can hear at mine.
"Oh, my God."
I want Danny to spend more time with my son.
He made plans with him and now he's trying to pull out.
"And guys ""pulling out"" is why I have a kid in my first place."
"Okay, fine, I'll do it."
But it's not fair.
You asked me right in the middle of sex.
"I was like... ""Ah, ah, ah... oh, okay, I'll take your son to Dave  Busters."
"Okay, quick announcement."
It's a new year and I wanted to shake things up a little bit.
So I decided to dye my hair red
- But then I chickened out.
"- Thank God, because red hair is the worst."
"However, I did convince Candace to do it."
Yeah!
Ta-da!
You like it?
I love it.
I love it.
It is beautiful.
It is great.
Like a bowl of tomato soup.
"If I had a grilled cheese, I would just dunk it on your head."
It's like your whole head's on fire!
"Love you, fire head!"
Now all we have to do is fill in the gaps.
I'm buying it.
Down payment.
"Call it rent, call it what you like, but I am not leaving London."
- Hmm!
- Sorry.
Bad night.
"Buckley, Parfitt, meeting now."
"That way, we don't have to think about it."
"We don't even have to look either, because we're never gonna miss it that distance."
"It's a good plan, Daze."
A real good one!
- You think so?
- Totally.
Cool.
- Don't aim too high.
- Why not?
We don't want to that little bird.
"Oh, yea... good thinkin'."
Are you ready?
- Ready.
- Let's do it.
Who wants a snack?
Be careful they're hot.
Uhm... no thank you.
- Don't you like cookies?
"- Yeah, but..."
I feel kind of bad now.
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Are those oatmeal?
"Thanks, mister."
What's wrong?
"Wait a minute, did you put something in this?"
Why are you looking at us funny?
"No, no, no..."
It just that you girls aren't what I expect it.
We didn't picture you either.
Keeps life interesting I guess.
Do you have any milk?
"I hate to interrupt or anything, but... don't you think you girls are better be load?"
You told me to do whatever it takes to stay in.
That didn't including shooting your fellow agents.
Those guys should have never been there.
That's not the point.
That's exactly the point.
God damn it David.
You shot three agents.
I winged them.
I tried to keep them alive.
Which is more than they did for me.
They didn't know who you were.
I told them.
I surrendered.
What do you want me to do?
So are you taking me off the case or what?
"No, I wish I could."
"Believe me I wish I could, but no."
Is that it?
You risk blowing my cover to chew me out?
You risk blowing my cover to chew me out?
"No, littman told me to find out if you had gone nuts."
"So, I'm going to tell him you haven't, right?"
You tell him whatever you want.
Oh no.
"I'm going to tell him that you haven't, right?"
Will that be all?
Yeah.
Hi.
"Hello, Mr. Davis."
I am yuko.
How are you doing?
Mr. sawamato said you found this place empty.
I knew I had 'til eight or nine o'clock to talk Jimmy out of killing Morrie.
"But meanwhile, as far as Jimmy knew, I was going along with the program."
I pulled out his hair. I bit him.
He's out fuckin' cold.
I'm enraged.
I wanted to kill this little fuck.
I walk away.
We start to go in the fuckin' joint.
I don't want to turn around.
Jimmy's going like this to me.
I don't want to fuckin' turn around.
I don't want to turn around.
"He picks up his fucking head, he says, ""Ah...."""
"I said, ""Don't say it! """
"""Jerkoff! """
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
I fucking fly at him!
"I got him and I'm banging his head, biting his fuckin' face."
I'm pulling his hair out of his head.
I beat him to a fuckin' pulp.
"To a fuckin' pulp, I tells ya."
He's laying there full of fucking blood.
I'm out of breath.
Forget about tonight.
Forget about it.
It was like a load off my mind.
Poor bastard.
He never knew how close he'd come to getting killed.
Even if I had told him he would have never believed me.
"-Jimmy, could I talk to you now?"
-You're a pisser.
You know that.
I won't get a fair trial.
I'm not going to no prison.
"Lila, Chief Dixon said the cops that are after you..."
Dale Dixon?
Yeah.
He was the one that was by the house.
"You used to know him, didn't you?"
"Yeah, I used to know him."
"Ronnie, I didn't come all this way not to see my baby."
"Now, they'll be watching our house."
So you got to take me someplace outside of town.
"Oh, Lila."
And then tonight you're gonna have to bring my baby out to see me.
And then tomorrow I'll be gone.
"Ronnie, please."
I'm your sister.
I need your help.
"Okay, Lila."
Okay.
RONNIE:
A friend of mine's grand-mamma died a couple of months ago.
She had a house off the highway past the bait shop.
There's no one living there now.
"I'm going to be out there all night, honey, so don't wait up for me."
Are Dud and John going to be with you?
"No, they're not gonna be with me."
We don't need 19 goddamn people in a car to watch a house.
I don't mean you're incapable of watching the house.
"Hey, just 'cause I'm not from L.A."
don't mean I can't watch a goddamn house.
Okay?
Don't be ridiculous.
- Maybe he's wrong.
- Wait a minute.
Let's see that.
- What do you think of that?
"- You know, you're in a hurry and..."
"Garnett, you're wanted on the telephone."
Just a minute.
I'll answer it for you.
It will only take about five minutes.
Let us have your pants.
- Hello.
"- Hello, John."
Will you hurry?
Tell him the minister is here.
Margaret's been ready for an hour.
We're all waiting for him.
"All right, I'll tell him."
- Who was it?
- It was the minister.
He said to take it easy.
He'll be about a half-hour late.
- Good.
"- You see, there's plenty of material."
- I'll take them down and have them fixed.
"- No, you don't."
"Pop, take them to Schmidt's and have them back in five minutes."
- You want two cuffs on them?
"- Yeah, one on each leg."
And hurry up.
Tell him I got to have them back right away.
"While we're waiting, we'll indulge in the famous indoor sport."
"No image, no arrests, no Internet profile."
- No way to see what he looks like.
- So I could go undercover as him.
"- Could be pretty risky, Bos."
- But worth it.
This is more than just a gambling ring.
I can tell you he's scheduled for some casino time after his 8:00 massage.
Looks like one of us is gonna have to rub down a bad guy.
Good idea.
Massage?
No.
No.
Don't look at me.
I'm the cruise director.
I've already given up my cover.
I'm a dude.
You guys suck.
That's nice.
"Just a little higher up the thigh, honey."
There we go.
"Just a little higher, babe."
"There it is, sweet cheeks."
Why don't you just relax and enjoy the pressure points?
How's about you shut up and give me the happy ending?
Okay.
I'll give you a happy ending.
Once upon a time...
The end.
Bingo.
- You're back.
- I am.
I felt a little underdressed.
"Is that right, Denny?"
I'm Pica now.
"Some days yes, other days no."
(Mouthes) Pica.
"The police have your DNA on the knife, the victim's blood on your clothes."
Witnesses saw you running from the lane.
They may have.
But I didn't do it.
He was alive when I found him.
"I took the knife out, but he died."
OK.
"Alright, we'll look into it further and get back to you."
You can't possibly believe him.
We've got our instructions.
Got your baggy eyes spot-on.
"Thanks, mate."
"Who is he, for Christ's sake?"
He is Pica.
What do we know about his prior?
Statutory rape. 15-year-old girl.
He was 19.
Girl.
Interesting.
You reckon it was a stitch-up?
"Well, come on."
"He looks like he did it, he sounds like he did it, he's homeless, he's got a serious prior."
It's the easiest stitch-up in the world.
Jails are full of guys who are there because they look like him.
You know?
No.
So you guys have sorted things out?
We haven't sorted out a bloody thing.
- You slept with Jack?
- You slept with Vanessa?
Serena Van Der Woodsen here's looking at you.
Jack?
Blair?
Really?
That's calculating.Even for you.
I was sad and he tried to comfort me.
You call that comfort?
More like collusion.
Like you didn't do that with the dregs of d.u.m.b.o.
I'm standing right here.
I can't believe you slept with miss Carr.
And you were in jail?
I can't believe you let some guy take photos of you.
Wh-what was he doing there?
"No,no,no."
It wasn't as bad as it sounds.
Okay?
"You guys just stop it,okay?"
She's trying to create
A divide between us.
This is exactly what she wants.
We can't let that happen.
You want to know something?
I don't think it's her that created the divide.
I think it was you.
"You're the reason we're on ""gossip girl"" in the first place."
If it wasn't for you we'd all be safe.
Okay that's enough.
We all did what she said we did.
- You can't blame Serena for this.
"I'm used to it, but you?"
Are you saying you don't want to see me?
I'm saying that I'm scared of losing you.
The people I love all end up turning their back on me.
I won't be able to bear it if you do.
I don't fucking care if the judge can't find me a new home.
I'll manage.
Where will you sleep?
Under a bridge or on a bench.
"Anyway, it's cool you called me."
You'll sleep on a bench.
Or in a squat.
But it's dodgy.
There are always problems.
Sleep at my place.
We'll find a solution tomorrow.
Your place?
Just for tonight.
And don't tell anyone.
I'm not supposed to put you up.
Can I finish my pizza or should we go now?
"Go ahead, finish it."
I'll go and pay.
Your bathroom's so clean.
Don't you ever wash?
Help me with the sheet.
What are those marks?
Nothing.
You live alone?
- Yes.
"- You don't have a girlfriend, a wife?"
- I'm divorced.
"Second, you're lookout only."
You're not goin' inside.
Can't he be lookout?
It's fine.
"Actually, yeah, can he be lookout?"
I'm not done.
"Last, you need to respect my leadership skills."
"I'm the leader, okay, and you need to treat me accordingly."
"You realize that real leaders don't tell others they have leadership skills, but you got-"
"- You sure about that, man?"
"I mean, this is my heist, right?"
This is just a robbery.
"Look, this is your heist, you're the leader and I respect your leadership skills."
"Too late, homie."
All right.
All right.
You can come along on the heist.
It's not a heist.
Thank you.
"Hey, all right."
"Yeah, okay."
Thank you.
Yeah.
It means a lot.
You guys hear me okay?
Yep.
Clear up here.
All right.
Be back in a minute.
"All right, guys, let me show you how the big boys do it."
I'm buyin' boobs.
What are you gonna get?
Kike.
Did you hurt my baby?
"No, I..."
You son of a bitch.
"What did you do, where is he?"
Where is he?
I don't know!
You're going to find him.
"As God is my witness, you are going to find him."
"Yes... yes, you!"
"I'll call the police, I swear to God."
I swear to God I will throw you back in that cage
If you don't bring my baby home.
"Baby, how the fuck am I supposed to know"
Where he is?
I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck.
"I don't give a fuck, you will figure it out."
"Go, go, go!"
"Okay, okay."
"Fuck, I'm ready to go inside and get in shape."
I think my baby girl is in for a treat tonight.
"(Man) Yo, that's the shorty that wanted me to wifey it up,"
But she let the next nigga hit it.
"I was like, ""How you want me to wifey it up"""
"And you let dude hit?"""
"Shit, that's why you can't trust these bitches, man."
"(Pete) Can't trust niggas, neither, man."
"Yo, she even got the name ""Danny"" tattooed on her pussy,"
"But I don't know if it was for me,"
"'Cause that nigga's named Danny, too."
(Laughing)
Only place I didn't try was the men's room.
- You try Munch's cell?
- Yeah.
No answer.
"You know, Dr. Swan had to make sure Kyle and the donor were okay."
Maybe there's a problem.
Come on.
What the hell is going on here?
"Casey, take Ms. Solwey out to the car."
Leave her out of this!
We didn't drag her into this.
"John, relax."
Relax.
Why'd you bring her here?
Amy's next on the transplant list.
That kidney would've been hers anyway.
"You're doing what we're trying to stop, John."
That kidney was bought and sold.
So let's just throw it away.
She dies.
I know that you care about her.
But you can't do this.
- If that was your son in there...
- It's not my son in there.
We're not talking about my son.
"When you collar James McGovern, you tell him your son's life is worth more than Kyle's."
"I gotta collar you, John."
You arranged this.
Novak saw you here.
You don't think Swan gonna give you up to get himself a better deal?
Why would I do that?
Did he ask you to put that kidney in Amy Solwey?
Did he hang himself?
No... he goofed it up.
He...
The rain.
What's up with you?
Soft in the head?
Did you get lost?
Yes.
"Here, with you."
"It's not like in the movies or in books, where everything is precise, thought-out, organized... with a clear-cut goal."
"Everything's chaos, chance... pain... disorder..."
"Still, my way of putting things in order is to get them, one by one, my mother's lovers."
There's one left.
Do you want me to tell?
No.
What for?
To know my life.
There is no life.
There's only a war.
Listen.
I can't hear anything.
Close your eyes.
Mary?
"You're gliding too high, friend."
You're gonna crawl back.
I won't cushion your descent.
You're overdosing.
"If I were human, I'd waste you here and now."
I'm not going to be human.
I won't go back on my word.
"I wouldn't want to hurry you, but theaters run on precise timetables."
Go betweens too.
Obviously.
The lash will loosen their tongues.
Put 'em onboard the ship.
Won't find it so easy to launch an escape from there.
No!
You take 'em!
And you stay with them till I send for you!
Excuse me.
I got hit over the head by two men over there.
Shut up!
You lad.
Come here.
Mr. Atkins obviously needs all the help he can get.
So you go with him.
What will happen to the women?
You leave the women here.
It'll give Captain Taylor something to consider if he tries to plan another escape.
And what are you gonna do about those two men?
What I always do to people who try and cross me.
We have to get those women to safety.
Come on.
Who are you?
Bless you.
Don't be afraid.
He's a friend.
I need you to take them to the tree house.
But he's a savage.
"Far from it, madam."
He's my best friend and he's your salvation.
And where are you going?
I've got to find a way onto that boat.
You'll be fine.
I can't wait to dive in and find out all about you.
Mer looks weird.
Does she look weird to you?
She looks like she's gonna pee her pants.
"Oh, crap."
I made her hydrate.
Meeting the family always blows.
I'd never make you do that.
"Me, either."
One of the many perks of dating a dead guy.
Who's that lady touching Meredith?
Derek's mom.
"Oh, that's why she looks so weird."
"She does not look weird, okay?"
I've got it under control.
Mer is doing... great.
Looks like she's gonna pee.
"Dr. Yang, you mind checking on some of my post-ops?"
ER is swamped with traumas.
"Also, would you like to go on a date with me?"
I'm sorry?
A date.
"You said not to play hot and cold with you, so, um, I'll pick you up around 8:00?"
"Oh, and make sure mr."
Kenner in room 2-2-1-2 gets that enema.
He's been holding on to it for days.
Okay.
'Cause that wasn't weird.
"See, another perk of dating a dead guy."
No awkward dates.
"2-to-1, but who's counting?"
Why can't I have that nice man's organs?
Thank you.
There is the possibility that we might not actually win this thing.
"Oh, yeah?"
Bite your tongue!
Bite your damn tongue!
"Look, guys, we don't date, we don't travel, we don't have any money."
The only thing that we do have is the 2.09 Competition.
"If we can't even win that, what's the point?"
"Hey, hey."
Look at this!
"No, no, no, no."
Yeah.
We suck.
"Your father would be so proud of you, Ben."
Yeah.
Do you remember anything about him?
Not really.
Maybe when he shaved?
"Yeah, I think I watched him shave."
"So, what are your plans for the rest of the night?"
I don't know.
I'll probably just go back and work on that essay.
"Ben, you're working too hard."
"Between the job and school and the 2.09, you've had no time for just yourself."
"You have to squeeze in a little time for fun, Ben."
You only turn 21 once.
And it goes by very fast.
Okay.
All right.
- Good night.
"- All right, good night."
- Don't come home before 3:00.
But I'm gonna get you through it.
"Oh, God, I'm gonna throw up into your cut."
"Ahhh, I saw inside of you."
How are humans alive?
"Okay, uh, I'll do the surgery, and, uh, you just breathe, okay?"
We'll get you through this.
Okay.
"Ugh, what was that sound?"
I did not like that squish sound.
The pipe has been removed.
Now...
I'm sewing myself up.
"Okay, this is almost over."
You're doing great.
Just keep talking.
Keep talking.
Talking about what?
"Uh, tell me about Amy, hmm?"
You must be excited to see her.
"Very much, you know."
"Oh, God, what if it doesn't go well?"
"We haven't seen each other in a while, and what if it's weird?"
- Uhhh!
"- Keep going, keep going."
You're doing so well.
Why would it be weird?
I don't know.
I don't know.
"I mean, maybe we've grown apart."
Maybe she'll be repulsed by my frosted tips.
I was gonna defrost them before I saw her for the first time.
I'm sure it will be magical when you see her.
-Ninety seconds.
Ninety seconds is a long time not to think about it.
Except all I did was think about it.
I know.
It haunts me.
"Till now, the worst thing I'd seen was my dad doing shots off the houseboy."
"After this, I would gladly make that my screen saver."
We have to get past this.
We'll pretend it never existed.
I could do that.
Now all we gotta do is get rid of this chair.
"-Oh, thank God!"
-I know.
Come in!
Hi.
I'm sorry to barge in on your Valentine.
I had to get away from the yelling.
Mona's dumping Ross.
"-Oh, my God."
-Poor Ross.
"We watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes."
You know that birthing tape you wanted to see?
It's here.
We should warn you before you watch it.
Don't watch it.
You saw it?
Is it scary?
It's ironic how footage of someone being born..
can make you want to kill yourself.
"Honey, she may not have to watch it but she's going to have to do it."
Now I'm all freaked out.
Will you watch it with me?
Aren't you rushing things?
I find you irresistible.
I'll bet.
You know something?
Take off three inches of paint and you'd be quite attractive.
How do you like our country?
After tonight I'm going to become a citizen.
After tonight you'll be entitled to citizenship.
"Well, how long are you gonna be?"
Can't you see I'm busy?
Who was that?
My husband.
Your husband?
"Relax, we're not married anymore, we're just good friends."
He lives down the hall.
"Oh, come on, let's get out of here."
Where to?
I'll change my dress and I'll show you the town.
Which one?
"Oh, I don't know."
You're a better judge at that than I am.
This is my new one.
"Say, that's pretty."
I'll get into it.
I won't be a minute.
"Well, uh... take your time."
You married?
No.
Never been?
No.
How come?
I don't know.
"If you can't hold it, you take your ass to the men's room and cry in private on the toilet."
- Like a man.
- I need to use the men's room.
"Look, I know where Betty put the key."
I can get it tomorrow.
She's not gonna stay in her office all day.
What?
I thought you gonna start squawking about how dangerous it'll be to go back.
"Squawk, squawk."
I'm not gonna wag my finger.
It's Chuck's life and she can live it however she'd like.
I can't expect her to sit inside all day and...
- Hide!
"- No, I don't need to..."
"Woman, hide your ass."
"Oh, Vivian."
"I didn't know you were here, um."
We're just closing up.
There.
All closed.
- There's still people inside.
- Cleaning crew.
How are you?
"To be honest, I wasn't craving pie, I was craving company."
Lily absconded with herself.
First time in 30 years I don't know where she is.
I didn't know where else to go.
It's all right.
I'm sure Lily will be back.
"Oh, yes."
Though I don't know about Olive.
"And then of course, there's Charlotte."
"So I'm moving on, letting go."
Holding on to tomorrow.
I've always got the memories.
While I'm finding out who I'm gonna be.
We might be apart but I hope you always know.
You'll be with me wherever I go.
It's time to show the word we've got something to stay.
A song to sing out that will never fade away.
I know I'll miss you but we'll meet again someday.
We'll never fade away.
"So I'm moving on, letting go."
Holding on to tomorrow.
I've always got the memories.
While I'm finding out who I'm gonna be.
We might be apart but I hope you always know.
You'll be with me.
"So I'm moving on, letting go."
Holding on to tomorrow.
I've always got the memories.
While I'm finding out who I'm gonna be.
We might be apart but I hope you always know.
You'll be with me.
"Yeah, wherever I go."
"Wherever I, wherever I go."
[Music stops]
[Audience cheering]
Whoo!
"[Singing to the tune of ""Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star""]"
It used to be that no one knew.
"Except a very, very few."
-Lilly.
-Ollie.
"You don't want to die, huh?"
"Well, don't worry about it, sonny."
I'm gonna let you live.
"Oh, boy, thanks."
"Oh, boy, you're welcome, but on one condition."
"You gotta keep your mouth shut, you understand?"
Sure.
You don't talk to nobody.
You just keep your mouth shut.
(AGREEING) Don't say a word to no one.
You keep everything quiet.
You don't say nothin'.
Nothin'.
Nothin'.
You don't say nothin' to anybody.
You keep your mouth shut and be sure you just do like I tell you.
Then you won't get into any trouble.
Shut up!
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
Someone's at the door.
Let's see who it is.
"Well, let's go."
You get the door.
"Okay, sure."
"But be sure when you open the door, you don't say nothin'."
Remember what I told you.
Keep your mouth shut.
Don't say nothin' to nobody.
"Just open the door, see who's there, and that's all."
You don't talk to nobody.
You understand?
"Just open the door, that's all I'm askin' you to do."
Jeremy!
What?
"Haven't you read the studies, Liz?"
A glass a day is actually good for you.
Lowers your blood pressure.
"And smoking's good for your lungs, right?"
What do you expect?
You said we're a family full of addicts.
I never said that.
You said that you were the only one who wasn't hooked on something.
"That's, of course, unless you count the wine."
You.
"And then there's Nick, who's famous for his zany hi-jinx, and Nick's mom, a pill freak."
Jeremy...
"I'm a guest in your house, right?"
Yeah.
"So do you think it would be rude of me if I told you, as a guest, that you're a spoiled little jerk?"
What do you think?
I need a ride to this party.
I am not taking you.
We have guests.
"Oh, come on, mom, what am I gonna do?"
Sit here and watch figure skating-- [whispering] Sit down.
I'll take you.
It was very nice.
Thank you.
Liz:
You're welcome.
"Well, you sure do give your mom a pretty hard time."
I see her...
Like...
Twice a year.
"- Not yakuza, are you?"
- I'm sorry.
I hand out flyers.
So you're a loser.
"I was a real estate broker, but I didn't accept voluntary retirement, so they tried to force me to quit by making me hand out 2,000 flyers a day."
I don't care.
"When I did that, they made me do 3,000."
They know it's impossible.
"They want to make me quit, and I want to quit."
But my kid's still in high school.
I need to send him to college.
Then stay away from drugs.
Some people kill themselves.
If you won't use drugs...
I'll stay.
I hope you cheer up.
Thanks.
Can I see you again?
Were you okay?
You're kind.
I fell bad for him.
Dangerous work.
"Yours, too."
Not like I want to do this.
I wanna work front desk at a top hotel.
"I actually want to open my own boutique store, too."
Thanks.
Take care.
"Hey, no, no, no!"
Can't I just have one?
I always wanted to eat all the nuggets myself.
All the nuggets?
This is hard.
It doesn't have to be.
I just think the most important thing for you is going to be let him do the talking.
Right.
"Okay, you're right."
I got it.
I got it this time.
Hi.
Hi.
Excuse me.
That was better.
I am not cut out for this one-night stand thing.
It's not for everybody.
"I mean, I know it seems silly to you, Matthew, but I just wish somebody would notice me."
"Not as a mom or as a carpool captain, but as a woman."
Do you know how long it took me to do this to my hair?
A minute?
No.
"A long, long time."
"God, this is impossible."
"Come on, let's get out of here."
I'm never going to meet anybody in a grocery store.
"You met someone, didn't you?"
"Yeah, we had a moment over by the goat milk."
I think she's into me.
I'll see you at home.
Are you done with that cart?
"Hey, knock yourself out."
Wow.
"I don't want to embarrass you, but your hair is really pretty."
It must take you a long time to make it do that.
You're in a good mood.
- A real weird story.
- It makes me feel eerie.
I'm going to bed.
"Me, too."
I'm totally bushed today.
Good night.
"- Tomorrow, let's all go there and see."
- Go where?
See what?
Those two trees that committed double suicide by being struck by lightning.
Don't be stupid!
That happened a long time ago.
Those trees can't still be there.
I can't see them.
"Grandma told me they were still here, though."
Burnt trees keep standing forever because they won't rot.
There they are!
That's it!
Let's go and see.
Why don't we just look from where we are?
"I don't know why, but I'm a little scared."
"""Those two cedar trees look as if they have committed double suicide. """
"""We are two elopers."
"""Why not live next to them?"""
What are you doing?
Sorry!
I just got carried away because of the mood.
Stupid!
I'm going back!
Wait a minute!
"Hey, wait a minute!"
What's wrong?
"Well, I honestly think that you're a train wreck."
Hi.
Hey.
You look nice.
Thank you.
I'm glad you called.
Yeah.
"Um, I called to give you... this."
Found it...
"Grady's, yeah."
"He asked me to take my shirt off to see if I was wearing a wire, and the mouse ears, I don't know."
You don't have to do that anymore.
Case is closed.
"Okay, so how does it work, the dying part?"
"Well, in Switzerland, a doctor would give a patient such as yourself a lethal dose..."
"- Oh, my God."
- Of sodium pentobarbital with a drink.
"There is no pain, no suffering, you just fall asleep."
"An option is to go to Switzerland and be what they call a death tourist, and fly..."
So?
Did you ever find out if your mom was a drug dealer?
"Oh, yeah, she's like a kingpin."
She has a whole empire.
You're such an idiot.
Hey.
Who's cat is that?
It's Casper.
"I gotta go out of town, for another job."
How long will you be gone?
Maybe a few months.
And who will you be this time?
Hard to say.
"Well, he needs me."
You have your law and...
I have mine.
"Best thing you can do, Blake, is to get out of here as quick as you can."
You need medical attention.
Take the canoe.
"It's easy going now, but it won't be when the heavy snows come on."
Will you come with us?
"No, I'll stay here and work the mine."
"When you come back in the spring, we'll divide what I've found."
I came to say good-bye to Buck.
He never would have forgiven me if I'd forgotten that.
"Would you, Buck?"
You could have skipped that.
You're only making it tougher on everybody.
"Oh, Jack, put your arms around me."
"Well, I'll be seeing you."
Yes.
You'll be seeing me.
I'll be seeing you too.
Every day and every night and every minute.
This isn't the end.
It can't be.
Careful of that first stretch of rapids.
After that it's clear sailing.
"Good-bye, Thornton."
And God bless you.
"Good-bye, Blake."
"Good-bye, Jack."
"Good-bye, Claire."
"It's hard to say no to that call, isn't it, Buck?"
"It's all right, boy."
I think it's not a good idea.
-What do you mean?
-Maybe I call you.
But I don't think so.
-You didn't like it?
-I like it very much.
"But, Tony, come on."
"You're a nice guy, but I got my own problems."
I don't want all the time prop you up.
"What, are you fucking kidding me?"
-What you doing?
-I didn't expect you so soon.
Tell my uncle I'll talk to him later.
Lowe is not a 98-99 mile an hour guy.
Driven out to deep left field!
"Giving chase is Henderson, on the run!"
See ya!
An opposite-field home run....
-There ain't no bear back there.
-Fellas!
"Well, the way I feel right now, I'd like to meet a bear."
What would you do if you did meet him?
That bear would have just as much chance as this pork chop.
Where you boys all going?
It ain't over.
Somebody's going to get something they ain't expecting.
Have a bite.
"Look out, here he comes!"
Where's Furio?
"He couldn't get a flight out of Rome, so I'm driving again today."
"Come on in, he'II be right down."
You're not as important as this body.
When he said he was busy everyday...
I guess he had time to exercise.
"Then...when he said he was too busy, and didn't have the time,"
I wonder if it was all an excuse?
I wonder if he just didn't want to see me?
"What do you mean, he didn't want to see you?"
Even on that day...
He was on his way to see you.
That's right!
You said he even had something to tell you when he saw you!
The thing he was going to tell me when he saw me...
You think it was to tell me that he loved me?
What if it's not?
Gil Da Ran...
I love you.
Like this!
I'm sure he was going to say this to you.
Yeah...
I'm sure you're right.
"I'm sure that's it, right?"
That's it...
And here I am on my own...
How stupid I am.
"Yeah, yeah..."
That's stupid.
Let's pack up some clothes.
This color looks really good on Yoon Jae.
This color looks really good too!
Wow...
This color suits really well too...
Here.
We promised.
I thought you were OK with that.
Yeah.
That was when the wolf seemed a long way away.
"Now, I mean this room feels half the size it normally does."
I know what you mean.
It was fun the last full moon.
Yeah...
"Out there, all of us together."
It was...
It was a rush.
It was...
It was right.
"I mean, it was right."
Outside in a pack is where we belong.
The only reason we transformed outside last time is because we ran out of time.
"Mum and Dad, they won't let that happen again."
They can't stop us if we don't let them.
"Rhydian, I won't go against them."
"So, for the rest of our lives we'll just spend the one night we should we running wild, locked up?"
Yeah.
"No, I mean, no."
No.
I can't think about the rest of my life right now.
OK.
I'm with you.
Whatever you decide.
We stay.
Fancy coming to the exhibition with me?
Come on!
Don't you find it interesting?
What?
"Sir, get in here!"
"We have 5 deceased males and what looks to be a crude lab, all shot in the head execution style."
- Any anthrax on the scene?
- Only residue.
There's also packing and tags from 4 new backpacks.
"- All right, listen up."
- Backpacks?
They're already on the move.
We're too late.
Have you finished?
"As you said, the sun is set."
Yes.
I'd like you to meet a colleague of mine.
Dr. Reid.
- May we speak?
- Of course.
I have a little time.
That was a joke.
I have all the time.
Please.
A joke.
"- Well, we're making progress."
"- Yes, progress."
That is true.
Is there no way for this thing to end?
This Jihad?
The Jihad will end when Allah wills its end.
Then how will you know that it is Allah's will?
When the Jihad ends.
I have been lying to you.
Of course you have.
My colleague has been outside watching us as we talked on monitors.
Why are you so uncomfortable?
It's like you're somewhere else.
What is it?
"If there's a problem, I'll take care of it here immediately, so just tell me."
Is someone making problems for you or can you not pay the bills?
Dad!
"No, there's nothing wrong."
Why are you getting on his case?
This isn't the first or second time you've seen him.
"This isn't the first or second time, but it was bothering me."
It's so easy to bother you.
That's nice.
"I can't see your eyes, I can't see your third or fourth eye behind that."
- All right then.
- Good bye.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
"- Don't be late, it's at seven."
"I won't be late, I won't be late."
Good bye.
Seat him at another table tomorrow.
Ahjussi!
We should go too.
"Right, go, go."
You displeased me today.
Yes.
"Mom, stop it."
"- Bye, Ahjumma."
- All right.
I'll leave oppa in your care.
Don't worry.
"I'll call you, Oppa."
How were you going to act?
I'll just take it between us as who gets who first.
"That's how it's gonna be, then."
There won't be no more cows stolen.
"Not from the Wood River Cattle Company... the Bar-Three Cattle Company, or the Haley Cattle Company."
Consider that my last word on the matter.
"Come on, boys, let's have an auction."
"You know, I got a weird feeling."
"Yo, me too."
We're being followed.
Look!
Tell them what you saw here.
"That you, Horn?"
You coming in here after me?
Giddap!
Come on.
Get them up there.
Hang in there.
Come on.
"Let him stop first, then give him slack."
Hitch him up.
Hang in there.
Ease up on him there.
You got him.
"Yeah, he's a good horse."
You go ahead... ride him around a little bit and tire him out.
Keep his head up.
"If you keep his head up, he ain't gonna buck."
- Could I talk to you a minute?
- You bet.
"All right, you go ahead and take the rough off of him."
I'll come back after he's quieted down and put a handle on him.
What'll I do if I get into a real storm with this horse?

"Look, all I'm trying to say is it's not the same Natalie."
"If you knew her, you wouldn't know her."
"Last night after the show, she got somebody fired."
- Really?
"- One of the crew, the sound guy."
There were some wires on the floor.
She was like... complaining and
"I mean, I met the guy when I was."
He was a nice kid.
Now what's he gonna do?
What's he gonna do?
Wait.
Don't tell me.
"Sound engineer billy logan, right?"
My what are you doing here?
"My god, come in, come in!"
I can't believe this.
You've been taking pictures of me.
"Yeah, I thought I saw you."
I hope you don't mind.
"There was nothing on the web site, so I took a few candids."
They're for the next issue.
"Cast and crew after-hours, behind the scenes."
"While I have you here,"
"I have, well, a couple of questions."
It's not your lucky day.
What a shame.
Just a kid.
At least he didn't hit anybody when he jumped.
Are we sure he jumped?
"""Tired of losing."""
Not much of a note.
Bust that shit up!
Bust it like it's Dyson's douchey-ass face!
Yes!
That face is never kissing again.
- What else?
- We wallow.
Kenzi break-up mix on repeat all frigging afternoon.
- You have a break-up mix?
"- Dude, you have so much to learn."
Yes.
And then it's girls on the town.
"We're gonna burn this city to the ground, baby!"
I don't do that.
I'm not much of a party queen.
Drinking equals losing control equals someone gets dead.
"Yeah, but what a way to go, dude."
"Okay, fine."
We'll cut loose somewhere safe.
"You know, this is what I don't get, okay?"
"I did nothing wrong, and I'm the one whose day has gone to shit."
"For Dyson, it's like, ""Bo who?"" Totally unaffected."
Let's go.
Let's go.
We're gonna party.
We're gonna forget about it.
All right?
We'll see about that.
"Okay, this is me in the bar."
- And this is me going back to bed.
"- Oh, no."
We are not wasting hours of dress-up.
I don't care if I have to slather you with fairy dust.
"So his DNA is at a murder scene... and he's not the victim, so what does that leave?"
Is he a witness or is he just someone who happens to be there?
I'm gonna double-check the results.
"I'm gonna triple check them, okay?"
There's a possibility that the DNA is old.
20 years!
"I'm saying it's possible, okay?"
He may not have been there.
"Mark, just think about it."
It's Jesse!
- I know.
"- It means he's alive, yeah?"
"Yeah I know, you're right."
"I know, I know..."
"It's what we always wanted, isn't it?"
"Oh man, it doesn't make any sense to me."
"What am I gonna tell my Mum, Dad?"
"Nothing, not yet, okay?"
"Look, I shouldn't even be talking to you guys."
I could get fired.
Sorry.
This thing could end up being public.
I mean it's the sort of thing the papers have been all over.
"Yeah well, if it comes to that we'll let them know."
But don't you think there's someone else we should tell?
Someone who was with us that day.
Pru?
Come on.
"Dad, I wanna ask you something."
Do you remember him?
"This is Jesse, Dad."
You remember he went missing as a young boy?
What do you need to hide from?
Your life is perfect.
I'm serious. I would give anything to have your life.
My life is so pathetic.
You have this great house.
Parents that are there.
No one bothers you at school.
"Rickie, I need to talk to you about the gun."
Don't.
"- You can't carry a gun, Rickie."
- l don't.
Because it would be really bad.
Tragically bad.
"Angela, I don't carry a gun. I wouldn't even know how to shoot one."
But didn't Brian see you?
Isn't that what he's going to tell them?
This is really serious.
People are going to think you are dangerous.
I know.
That's what I want.
"So, what did happen?"
My cousin brought it in to sell it.
And I got real mad at him for bringing a gun into school.
"So, we got into this big argument..."
and the next thing I knew the thing fell out of the box and went off.
And he peed in his pants and ran away.
- He did not.
- He did.
Big stain.
And that's what happened with the gun?
That's the whole story of the gun.
And now Brian is going to say you did it.
It is my fault.
I should have worked harder.
Now she's gone!
She's not gone.
I know where she is.
Sit down.
How do you know where she is?
Now use your head.
She's a young girl.
She wants to party.
She wants to get wild.
Too late to leave the island.
Where is she?
Where's the only place she could go?
"Eden East, the singles' side."
We gotta go get her.
You're damn right we do!
And I'm going with you!
I am not letting you go alone!
I don't care if I have to go there all night!
To find Trudy.
We're gonna go find Trudy for him!
"We can't even go to that side, all right?"
"And it's gonna get very dark, very soon."
Plus we have to be in bed...
What are you talking about?
Listen to me.
We have to be to bed at a very reasonable hour tonight because we cannot miss the sunrise in the morning.
"Now, Marcel said if we miss that sunrise, we will not be completing our course."
"We are here for the course, all right?"
- Yes.
"And stop eating and drinking, as well."
"You did her, and now you've come to see what it did to me?"
"- I love her out of pity, Mickey."
"- Don't you, by chance, pity me a little?"
- I love her out of sorrow.
"- Me, I love her out of full stop!"
- She respects you.
- Like one respects graveyards.
I'll never leave her to you.
It's to have you in her mitt that she took that mad flat just across from yours.
"Yes, you did your bit to waste the Venom."
But there's still three to go in her noble cause.
You up for it?
Now it's you she'll run away from.
Mickey isn't the brute you believe he is.
I don't have beliefs.
It...
It's tough to hurt you.
"For me to be able to kill you, you need to be a woman."
I'd wrap the blade in silk.
You wouldn't feel a thing.
No.
She would.
Buzz off!
Oh no!
"We are such children, prince."
Mary...
See?
- D'you suffer?
- D'you?
Our clients!
"Right on time, like for church!"
"Hey degenerate, you got Gothic mosques at home?"
Let me ask you one last time.
Let us go.
You can call me an obsessed hypocrite if you want... but I can't let you go.
You never loved me back.
I thought things would get better if I held onto your empty glances... but you never thought of me the way I cherished you.
"If I can't have your heart, then I'll keep your body at least."
You'll stay with me until I die.
(Downtown Magok)
How did it go?
I found a merchant who trades with Puyo.
He's at the tavern.
Let's go.
I work for Sosuhno.
You want to buy seal fur?
Yes.
You're late.
Mr. Oh from Haengin bought all we have.
I heard the pirates smuggle seal fur.
I'll pay you handsomely.
"Let me meet Buwiyum, the pirate captain."
You can't meet him unless he approaches you.
Help me.
That's him.
Step back!
I want to see your captain.
I don't want to fight.
Lead us to him.
Mr. Yu in Magok sent them.
They have a letter from him too.
I'm Buwiyum.
You want to trade with me?
"I'm disguised as a merchant... but I'm Jumong, Commander of the Damul Army."
Have a spot?
Rather.
"Excuse me, sir."
"I wouldn't touch it if I were you, sir."
"Too watery, sir."
"Besides, it'll rust in the lining of your stomach."
- We'll be the judge of that.
"- Wait, sir."
There's a fly.
- I don't see a fly.
- Neither do I.
"There it is, sir."
It just dove under the ice.
I'll get the little nipper in half a jiffy.
I got him.
Hear him?
Humming like a beehive.
He's gone.
Ain't that a shame?
There he goes.
"Come along, Mitchell."
I think we'll forget the punch.
"Tommy, you know we have Sgt. Higginbotham to thank... for your being let out of the expedition."
That's right.
The Colonel says I'm the only man sharp enough...
- to replace Sgt. Ballantine.
- That's very flattering.
"I'm only glad to be so some help in, shall we say, Cupid's service."
"One thing I can promise... with Cutter and MacChesney about, you won't have one dull moment."
I've got a feeling they don't like me very much.
It's just as well.
"- The army's no place for sentiment, I says."
"All right, well, I would try to go to Applebee's with you."
"Well, I would try to go to Applebee's with you!"
So let's try.
I want to try!
"Well, let's try!"
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I am so sorry that it took all of that.
But you know what?
"Now I can honestly say, with love in my heart' that you are my man."
Could you ever love me again?
"Well, you're my wife."
And I never stopped loving you.
Now come here and give me a kiss.
This next jam goes out to all you party people in the house!
"And that time that you got sick, you didn't want me to see you, so you locked me out of the bathroom?"
No!
Then I passed out!
Yeah.
And you called the ambulance.
"Well, because, before you passed out, it sounded like you were dying in there."
You know?
I thought I was dying.
I did.
"Yeah, well, what was I supposed to do?"
I should have broken down the door.
You've been a really good friend.
You have been the best friend in the world to me.
"Now don't stop dancing, y'all!"
Party ain't over!
It's far from over!
"Silence, please!"
I don't know you.
Mujik.
Let go of my arm before I get mad!
I heard that you have a friend in the detention facility at the
Royal Repository.
I must see Chun-su.
Can you get me in?
You're the one who put him there and now you want to get him out?
I'm begging you.
What are you going to do?
Break him out of jail?
I'll find a way.
"And if that's the only way, I will break him out."
Now that's a joke!
What do you think you're doing?
!
"If I can just talk to him, I know I can find some kind of evidence."
Get up from there?
A nobleman can't kneel before a peasant!
A friend's life is at stake.
I don't care about status.
I have no excuse for what I have done to Chun-su.
But you have to know this.
Chun-su is a friend I treasure more than my own life.
Stop right there?
"Hey brothers, what are you still doing here?"
"Mujik, is that you?"
What are you doing here?
I told you to fetch the brothers!
Do you know this boy?
"Oh, he's a new kid that just joined the gang."
What are you waiting for?
I'm sort of a workaholic.
So you're a pro.
You can put it that way.
"Now, let me examine you first."
Sickness in the heart means that the left ventricular heart has a problem.
"To put it into exact terms, going down from the collarbone, passing by the diaphragm, meeting the third nerve cell."
Here.
How do you feel?
I feel hot all over.
I knew it.
- What happened?
"- It's gotten hard, you see."
Am I going to die?
You won't.
Then what shall I do?
I should set it free.
It'll get serious if you hold it in.
Wait!
Since when have humans become so scary?
You said it would be a piece of cake.
"You're the one who always said that, not me."
So then?
Are you trying to point fingers now?
How dare you speak to me that way?
Damn it!
I got you!
Damn it!
How dare you strangle your father...
Dad!
- Dad?
- What?
"Sir, I didn't intend on this."
No.
But why?
Are they doing this to spite him?
Could be.
Why?
Maybe they don't want him to be strong.
I'll tell him he has to be strong.
I'll hide in there and they won't find me and I'll spend Saturday with him.
"No, we won't go in now."
"We brought him his things, we'll give it to the guard at the entrance."
I want the guard to tell Daddy that I came to see him and to give him a kiss.
I'll write him a note.
"You're the witch and I'm the prince, okay?"
The princess too.
"You're the princess too, okay."
"No, you're the prince and princess, I'm the witch and all the guards."
Then the prince came.
"- Look, look."
"Hi, Alex."
I can't get a hold of you.
"I left you messages at the theater and at home, you haven't called me back, so I'm trying again."
Please call me back.
It's Ora.
Thank you.
"So, my child?"
I know what you're going through.
It's as if we're losing the ground beneath us.
Dear God.
Do you need money?
"There, there."
"Dinner is ready, and stop with your secrets."
"You're not alone, so stop whispering."
Be careful.
Means you are not shooting me?
I had to shoot.
But not with gud with boom.
Make a boom which blast.
"Bring the beg like he put in that locker, and we will put boom in it."
And after that we will exchange there bags.
Then we will have 900000/-.
And he will have the boom.
And by pressing the remote.
How can i do this.
I don't know how to press the remote.
He is big rascal.
He is trashing him with boom to have his money.
You stuff has also trash by him.
Should i shoot him right here?
Will we trash him in his style.
Means with boom?
Yeah.
And now there is no tension of getting same to same bag.
Really Bhai you have.
What?
Bag Bhai (brother).
This boom can blush even by touching hand.
What shall i do?
Put it in this.
"Now let me go, let me go Papa."
Papa?
"He is saying Papa just like us, Papa."
Papa we should took on photo.
"Sir, what are you doing, it will blast."
"Sir, do you also want to put bag in safe deposit."
Modified it how?
Not in a good way.
"Said he's a vet,right?"
Afghanistan?
- Maybe we crossed paths.
- l don't think so.
I wonder what he saw out there that made him like this.
You get to the good part?
You made it a loop.
What do you mean?
Can we unloop it?
The detonator and booster can't be separated from the main charge without triggering the fuse.
Designed it special for hotshots like you...
And me.
Anything that's put together can be taken apart.
And we ain't got nothing in common.
We'Il see.
- Can you do this?
- Yeah.
He's a punk.I got this.
All right.Here's the plan.
"On three,you're stepping off that mine."
Got to do it cleanly.Then get behind that blast wall.
- l can do that.
"- No,he's gonna need help."
He's been standing here for hours.His legs are dead.
I don't need you.
"As soon as he's off the plunger,I can find the back door to this thing and defuse the mine."
Let's go.
"All right,on three,you're hauling ass."
"One,two..."
Three!
"Well, I think it's way too soon to start packing up our desks."
Come on.
You know he's gonna bring in his own people.
"No, we don't."
we haven't even met him yet.
He might want to keep things intact.
Seriously?
And not clean house?
He's throwing out merc's toilet.
Mm.
Stop it.
We need to stay positive.
I have a good feeling about this.
You do?
I don't.
"Well, I really do."
I am so fucked.
No way this guy isn't gonna clean house.
"Well, you haven't even met him yet."
I don't need to.
It's what I would do.
But you're brilliant at your job.
Why wouldn't he want to keep you?
Because I'm brilliant at it.
"Okay, you know what you mean, but..."
You never want someone who can do your job better than you can.
Why do you think I've got Andy and myra?
"Plus, if this guy finds out they offered me the job before him, forget it!"
Fucked!
"Normally, at this point,"
I would try and be encouraging...
"Yeah, no point in that."
"Although, all of you will have to be out of here by then."
- Where should I go?
Should I make myself invisible?
- Well I think It's cool here...
"No doors, wild."
"Tell me, how did you find this place?"
"Angie, three schnapps, and no objections!"
"Okay, my last offer... 150 per show, and only if it works."
Why wouldn't it work?
You never know.
And what happens if it doesn't work?
God damn it!
Don't you start up again with me.
Yes or no?
I just want to have it cleared up.
This guy's got an issue earning money.
"He's in debt, fiddles around on his show for a year  lives from nothing, and he gets stuck on the fine print."
Thanks.
"Alfons, you're my uncle."
You can't do anything about that and neither can I.
"I'm sorry to say this but  every time you get an opportunity, you blow it."
He's got a point.
Fuck you.
I think we got him.
"Ah, a tent!"
I haven't gone camping in a while.
Fine.
We got a lot done today.
"Got a lot done, but for what?"
For what?
Well good night then.
Can I sleep here?
But maybe he's what we need to mix with our blood now that we've lost belle Reve and have to go on without belle Reve to protect us.
"Oh, how pretty the sky is."
I ought to go there on a rocket that never comes down.
"Which way do we go now, stella?"
This way?
"No, hon, this way."
The blind are leading the blind.
Red hots!
Are you going upstairs and tell her to cut that out?
"If I go up, I won't come down."
Let's just forget it.
Remember that night she poured boiling water through them cracks in the floor?
I gotta go home pretty soon.
"-Come on, what do you say?"
"-No, I'm out."
"Every time you win a big pot, you're out like stout."
I got a sick mother and she don't go to sleep...
-...until I get in.
-What do you say?
I'm gonna wash up.
-stella?
"-Yes, Eunice?"
You tell them guys the kettle's on the stove.
I'm gonna break up the game.
-What did she mean by that?
-She'II pour it straight through the cracks.
"stella, wait."
Wait till I powder.
I feel so hot and frazzled.
-Do I Iook done in?
-You look as fresh as a daisy.
One that's been picked a few days.
And then see if you can hold it.
"Otis, you've got to be kidding."
What if I can't stop it?
"Well, then I'll get a really good look at what happened."
"Yeah, you stay right there in case I need you."
"Well, of course."
I was gonna do that.
"I'll be right there by your side, OK?"
"Ah, ah, OK."
All right.
That's good.
[Sighs]
"Well, I guess you're right."
He should have been able to stop it.
One thing I can't figure though...
I
Can't see how the car would push them into the street.
"Yeah, well, I don't know."
Wait a minute.
"He could've slipped, right?"
He falls back as the car rolls forward.
"Uh, could be, I guess."
RICHARD:
It's got to be the way it happened.
The driver... he won't swear he saw anybody push him.
OTIS:
"No, he won't swear."
"Well, come on."
I guess we better get this heap back to the pound.
"You know, it's a damn shame this thing's got that little old"
Whine there in the rear end.
I always sort of imagined myself had a little old car like this.
Great job.
That's all for today.
"All right, well, great."
Yeah.
How did we do?
Did we do good?
"I mean, are we gonna make it?"
"Well, you know, it's just our first session, you know."
We're not looking for an end result here.
It's not a competition.
"I get all that, but have you seen couples that are worse off than us?"
Yeah.
Or are we that far gone?
We're...
Are you gonna put a...
Like a numerical value on it?
"You know, Doc?"
Like a one to 10?
"One being worst, 10 being best?"
"No, hang on one second."
Where would you put us?
"Right where you are, sir."
"What if someone put a gun to your head right now and said,"
"""You have to answer this second or I'll shoot."
"""Are they gonna make it?"" What do you say?"
What would you say?
Whoa!
"Okay, no one has a gun to my head, Mr. Smith."
It's hypothetical.
It's not a place for inappropriate behavior.
And you definitely don't pull a hypothetical gun on your therapist.
Sorry.
Why are you singing that...?
"Oh, my God."
You just had sex.
"No, I didn't."
I was peeing.
I thought I made that clear.
"No, no, no, no."
That's your sex song.
You always sing it after you... perform your act.
"- No, I don't."
"- Yeah, yeah."
"Who are you talking to, buddy?"
I was there.
"When we were married, I heard it many, many times."
And then not so much at the end.
"- All right, so I had sex."
- Yep.
Christine and I have been dating for over three months.
You can't be surprised.
"Oh, no, no, no, no, I'm not surprised."
"I mean, I never really thought about it."
"But, hey, if you want to jump into the sack with the first girl who comes along, be my guest."
Be... my... guest.
"Actually, she's not the first."
"Right after you and I split up, I got one under my belt."
"""Under your belt""?"
"What are you, a pirate?"
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have brought it up.
"Obviously, you haven't had any and you're a little..."
"Anyway, it's nothing to be ashamed of."
"We've been divorced for two years, which means you haven't had sex in... just over three years."
Who would like to speak to Senor Juan?
I have some papers for him to sign.
He's with a client.
You can leave them with me.
"Sorry, but I have instructions to bring these papers back with me, signed."
"You can wait, then."
- I don't need the Internet.
- You think you don't need it.
"- I don't need one of those, either."
- Soon you'll say you don't need man.
"Well, for the last two years."
Two years?
No man?
- Or the Internet.
- The best place to find a man.
What ever happened to dinner and a movie?
A guy who spends his nights in front of a computer has to be a good date.
"He's not married, and he doesn't sleep with a lot of girls."
Maybe there's a reason he's not married.
Maybe there's a reason he doesn't sleep with a lot of girls.
Maybe... he's not even a man.
How do you say...?
- Don't knock it till you've tried it.
"- Yeah, that's it."
Tonight come by my house and we'll go into a chat room together.
- I don't think so.
- Tonight.
Promise.
- We'll see.
- Okay.
I'm sorry.
I thought it was a robbery.
How much longer?
Not much longer.
"Look, I need to get Schmidt into this freezer."
The drugs work better if he's cold.
Come on.
We got one shot at this.
You want to do it right?
Well?
Do you want to do this or not?
Get in!
What are you doing?
!
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
We don't have a lot of time.
"I can get you out of this, but you have to do exactly as I say."
I'm going to inject you with a drug --
I already don't like this.
"Shh, shh, shh!"
"When I do, you have to resist for a moment and then tell me where you hid Jabbar's ex."
No!
No!
Do you know what he'll do to her if her finds her?
!
"If we pull this off, the last thing he'll be worrying about is his ex-wife."
T-t-this -- this drug -- w-w-what does it do?
I don't think you want to know.
"Hey, you know what?"
I'm sick of being the last guy who knows what's going on!
"Now, what does the drug do?"
It's going to paralyze your entire body and stop you from breathing.
I-I-I didn't need to know that.
- Don't say that.
"Without you, I would have no reason to live."
"But with you, I can handle anything."
I'll find Martina.
I'll get her to confess.
No matter what.
Have faith.
You'll see: we haven't lost yet.
"For the love of God, hurry up!"
I'm not risking my life for 20 Scudi.
I think I heard a woman scream.
- You hear women everywhere...
I'm sure I'm not mistaken.
"Well, I didn't hear anything, so let's go back to our quarters."
Let go of me.
"- If you scream, I'll kill you."
What did I do to you?
What do you want from me?
I know you told the judges that Beatrice paid you to let me into the castle...
Why?
It's not true.
You lied in court.
Who paid you?
"Tell me, or I'll strangle you."
"Shout if you want - you're the one they're looking for, not me."
You're finished.
All I have to do is call them.
You're right.
I'm finished.
"Thanks to you, they think I'm a murderer."
So it won't cost me anything to twist your neck!
Who paid you?
", you know what?"
No respect around here.
That's why we're not Making big gold right now.
I don't really now How to river mine.
Can't be that much Different than the ocean.
Suck it all up.
The kougarok river Can Reach depths of 6 to 8 feet.
"But at this river bend,"
Kris will brave depths of...
Less than three.
Wearing a wave belt when he's In The water that's 2 feet deep.
Just get down and dive!
"Okay, I'm sorry, But."
How's it looking Over there?
"It looks good, Lots of red sand."
I want the gold Not the garnet.
"Keep going, jay, You're going good."
It could be A good day after all.
Really fine gold here.
"Okay, Keep sucking it up."
"I got to say, jay,"
That is the fastest You've ever found gold.
"Dude, I'm not even trying, And there's gold."
I told you!
I told you!
"It's gold, it's gold, it's Gold!"
"Okay, not gonna lie, We didn't exactly know."
Where to go in the beginning.
But it turned out great.
I think all of our hard work Is gonna pay off.
I told you!
I told you it was good here!
Of course you are.
This is it.!
"Let go of the girl, Hammond!"
What are you doing?
Let's keep going.
"Look, Natalie, if I had things my way... you'd be the girl I'd run away to paradise with."
But I'm gonna be your hostage.
"Natalie, it's over."
I can't let you ruin your life because of me.
- I think it's time for you to go home now.
- You can't mean that.
"You know, until yesterday... the worst thing I ever did in my whole life was cheat on a biology exam."
"And now I'm a car thief... a kidnapper... cop-shooter, police-evader."
I can't do this to you.
I can't make you part of this anymore.
I care about you too much.
"Besides, I can't hold you hostage anymore."
We ate the gun.
But you have the real gun.
Uh... real guns make me nervous.
I do better with the candy ones.
"Jack, you're innocent."
We can make this work.
You...
You're really something.
You know that?
- Thank you.
- For what?
For believing in me.
"Let the girl go now, Hammond!"
"It's been a hell of a ride, huh, kid?"
"What say you, uh... step out of the car and walk away from me?"
Smearing you across the front pages is not enough.
Scum like you shouldn't be allowed to live.
You're gonna die.
"Stan, stop it."
Stop it.
Help him.
He'll kill him.
I can't believe it.
I'm rid of him.
It's perfect.
We just call the police and tell them it was self-defence.
Are you crazy?
That's the one thing we can't do.
But why not?
He was trying to kill you.
I'm a witness.
Shut up and listen.
Connie will take care of it.
You just go home.
Do whatever it is you'd normally do.
Just act as if nothing happened.
"When he doesn't come home tonight, call his brother, ask him where he is."
"When he says he doesn't know, act worried."
"Don't call the police until 2, maybe 3 in the morning."
Tell them anything you want to except that he came here.
You understand?
What are you gonna do with him?
He'll just disappear.
"Police will look for him a few months, then give up."
"Now, come on, get out of here."
Take his car.
"After you've gotten rid of him, drive out to the airport, leave the car there."
Come back.
The company needs you and...
And so do I.
"Oh, you mean leave here?"
"Oh, I'm afraid Dr. Croatman would have something to say about that."
"But you're so much better, John."
"You've had a long rest, and you look wonderful."
"Don't you think if the psychiatrist examined you again, he'd see that?"
He does seem rather pleased with my progress.
"Oh, good!"
Then I'll tell Sam about it.
He'll know what's best to be done.
"If you wish, my dear."
But I'm not sure it'll do any good.
Stop pacing like a caged animal.
What if they don't let him out?
Why shouldn't they?
There's nothing wrong with him.
I know.
But you can go off your rocker just being in a place like that.
"If it doesn't work, we're finished."
"If it does, what about you and me?"
We just have to be careful.
"Mrs. Brown, Dr. Helck is here."
I've just come from Dr. Croatman.
"My dear, John is waiting for you to bring him home."
Wonderful.
"Well, it was a great 10 months."
This isn't the end.
We'd better go in.
We won't be able to see each other.
We can't pull this trick again.
Said he had a plan that would get him out of the mob.
I guess he was wrong.
They found him.
What did my brother mean to you?
Everything.
Take me to his place.
I want to get to know him.
Take you to his place?
Are you crazy?
You show up and start this mess that almost gets us killed.
"You don't have a clue who you're dealing with, do you?"
"If you wanna kill yourself, be my guest."
But who gave you the right to risk my life?
I can't go home.
I can't go to work.
You painted a big red target on my back.
Where's the check?
Mikhail used to say we could never stay in one Place too long.
We have to move all the time.
It's time for us to move.
- They'll find us here.
- The cable didn't have to die.
This is just the beginning.
I've seen it before.
"They won't stop until you're dead, too."
You can't go to the police.
You can't hide.
"Lvan and his boss, Kirov, are relentless."
"All right, I'll bring you to your brother's home."
This explains why Mikhail picked a bank in Nice.
Holy shit.
Looks like we got another chance.
"Instead, you'll go with Jimmy."
You come with me.
Have a good time.
Sit in the sun.
Take a couple days off.
We'll have a good time.
"When you come back, you'll go back to Karen."
"Please, there's no other way."
No divorce.
We're not animali.
No divorce.
She'll never divorce him.
"She'll kill him, but not divorce him."
You going to pay us?
Just give us the fucking money!
I can't.
I swear.
Let's go.
We'll throw the bastard to the lions.
Lions?
"I ain't going near any lions, Jimmy!"
Just throw him over the moat.
I'll get the money!
"They must really feed each other to the lions down there, 'cause the guy gave the money right up."
I'll get the money.
We got to spend the rest of the weekend at the track.
They mean business.
"Then, I couldn't believe what happened."
"When we got home, we were all over the newspaper."
At first I didn't even know why we got picked up.
Then I found out the guy we roughed up had a sister working as a typist for the FBI.
I couldn't believe it.
Let's get clear of this god-forsaken place.
Let's go!
We need to drink.Please.
Make it quick.
What are you doing?
It will keep you cool.
We have been pursued.
Let us go.
Now!
You're going to leave us here?
"I could make my life a lot easier and return you to jacob moore, if you would prefer."
"Soon as we clear the rocks, boom the main sail!"
Give her everything she can carry.
This ship's mine now.
Not if I have anything to say about it.
Get him!
"Take the wheel, boy!"
This one's for me.
You fight like a man with a lot to lose.
But I have nothing to lose.
Which makes me far more dangerous!
"First blood, I think."
"So, the evil island spirit."
"You're going to attack me with a stick, are ya?"
"I have a very, very unfair advantage."
"Oh, well we'll just see about that."
Die!
"Hold the wheel steady, boy!"
While I finish him off.
You see?
I have been living the outdoor life.
"Fresh air, plenty of exercise and nutritious food."
"I had it for you, only as I said, I didn't expect..."
- I know.
You said it before.
- You don't have to worry about it.
- I'm not worried.
- I'll have it by the end of the week.
"In the meantime, I suppose you'd like some spending money."
"Here, here's 500."
I'll take that.
It'll take me a few days to get settled.
"By that time, you can get that dough together and tell me where I come in."
Where you come in?
What do you mean?
"What business you want me to handle, what parts of town and what my cut is."
- Your cut?
- Yeah.
"That was the idea, wasn't it?"
"I took the rap, three years."
"You took the dough, made connections, built it up."
For you and me.
Wasn't that it?
"Oh, I see."
Yes.
I understand but you've got this thing all wrong.
"See, I work for Keefer."
He's the boss.
I haven't anything to say.
"If you want a spot in his business, why you'll have to take it up with him."
"Now, look, Frazier, I'm not taking it up with anybody but you."
You figure it out for yourself.
I'm taking up with you where I left off.
"That was the agreement, and we're going to stick to it."

Borrow her lipstick.

JULlE KLAUSNER:
"Oh, the Cover Girl stuff?"
Doesn't she promote that stuff?

"Paul, you are in trouble."""
"Rio ""Wolf:"" All right, guys, tonight's challenge."
You have to cook a traditional campfire meal for these seven
Cub Scouts.
They'll also be your judges.
I've got two recipes in this bag.
So go ahead and choose.
BETH HOYT:
"Here's a tip, you guys."
"Put your red wine in the fridge, and it lasts longer."
"Also, this is four bottles in this box."

"Um, I do, but I don't remember."
BETH HOYT:
Alex said it.
Brooklyn and Alex s

Count us in.

Yes.
But I really feel bad.
I am always scared that grandfather will find out.
It's alright.
It's better for grandfather not to know.
What is it?
Why are you staring?
"Whatever, your personality is bad."

"OK, remember, if you guys have good ones, get them in the comments."
We've got a bunch to get us started.
We're going to take turns.

"I mean, my initial, my initial thought is that Tara"
Reid's gotta die.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
No.
TED LEO:
I don't know.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"Any of those, it would be a mercy killing across the board, you know?"
TED LEO:
Yeah.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"I can't say Courtney's full name because I feel like she's like, Beetlejuice."
"If you say it like, even once, she'll show up."
"So I'm not going to regard that, but I would marry--"
BETH HOYT:
"I would marry Lindsay, because I think she has a second coming."
TED LEO:
You think so?
JULlE KLAUSNER:
You do?
That's optimistic.
But you think Tara's a lost cause?
BETH HOYT:
"God, for sure."
TED LEO:
I would marry Courtney because I think she's on her last legs.
BETH HOYT:
"Yeah, you're right."
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"Oh, and you want to inherit that sweet, uh, that sweet, sweet publishing money?"
TED LEO:
"I just, I feel bad about saying that."

I'm the only one now.
And what do I say about him?
He's very hardworking.
But what do you mean?
Is she your mother?
"No, she's my sister."
- Tell her not to interfere.
"Jamna, just a minute."
"Actually, Mr. Shreekant, Radha and Jimmy... ...were in the same college."
They...
They are in love and they've promised to get married.
Uhjjoo!

Hey!
Baek Eun Jo!
Chef!
Are you worried about something??
Oh!
Your face has a look of concern.
"Oh, are you finished?"
"Yes, of course!"
I cleaned everything.
Good job.
"Perhaps, did something happen to Ha Ni?"
Huh?
Why would something happen to Ha Ni?
You can go home now.
"Yes, Chef."
I'll be leaving.
Okay.
Good work today.
- Get home safely.
- Yes!
"Here we go No Ri, let's check your temperature."
No Ri gets fevers very often.
He's also a patient that was in ICU for over 6 months.
"So, you should have been more careful around him."
"If you play around with a sick kid like this, what would happen?"
I'm sorry.
Please be cautious.
He has also sent few of yours photographs together.
See!
God!
I look so fat.
Read what he says.
"Dear Damodar, many thanks for your help... you gave me in India."
India's police and custom are very suspicious.
That's why I don't like there.
My business is well spread here.
Now it's not possible for me to come... to India before 2 or 3 years.
I'm also planning to get married here.
I'm sending few photographs of ours together.
I hope you'll like it.
Uma!
- Yes.
I got an idea of postponing Radha's marriage.
What idea?
- Fantastic!
"Mister, there are kids in the house."
"Whatever you want to do, do it slowly."
"Bittu, go to sleep."
It's none of your concern.
Sleep!
Sleep!
Shyamaprasad Shrivastava!
Who's he?
I don't know.
But he wants to see you.
Send him in.
- Okay.
Hello!
Hello!
No need to look so depressed.. ..you won't get an off.
Get that.
Just one idol left!
"By the way, where's the trip headed?"
I can't believe you're coming with us.
The children are so happy.
She thinks you are crazy.
"I am going on a visit to the temple. - "" Hare Rama; Hare Krishna. """
""" Krishna; Krishna; Hare; Hare. """
""" Hare Rama; Hare Krishna. """
""" Krishna; Krishna; Hare; Hare. """
Where is he?
- A dozen of pot-bellied Ganesh idols.
- What!
Those Krishnas worth 250.
Eight of those brawny Hanumans.
- What are you saying?
- And five of those 'Sherawali'.
The lady sitting on the tiger.
What's the total?
"Three dozen, sir."
"- Three dozen, right!"
"Then, three Sai Babas bonus."
- What?
They are in a big demand.
Send it to the white Volvo parked there.
"- Okay. "" Hare Rama; Hare Krishna. """
What did you give him?
Give me too.
"- Funny, people are distributing alcohol like offerings.."
What's that?
What should I say?
Still thanks anyway for saying so.
But I don't want to hear anymore.
"Otherwise, it will be too much to take."
Goodbye.

Mr. Jung Ha-seok.
I was sent by Choi Sook-hyun.
"You know her, right?"
Sook-hyun asked me to deliver this message.
Sook-hyun wants to break up with you.
"It was too hard for her to say it, so I came instead."
You understand?
Sook-hyun said she's met somebody new.
"Of course you're a good person, and she loved you."
"But without realizing it, a new love appeared."
Please don't take it too hard.
Wish her the best with her new love.
And she hopes that... you'll find a new love too.
With all of her heart.
"You heard me, right?"
Mom!
It'll be ok.
You'll get better soon.

Mom will hear.

Connor:
"Matt, calm down."
"If you know where to go, let's hear it."

Case on God admitted.
"Paper, paper, paper."
High Court has put it's seal on it.

I think he's mad.
Who is this guy?
"Hey Jigna, what happened?"
"See, his wife ran away."
Who can live with that madman?
I don't even talk to him.
Or the Lord might punish us as well.
What a splendid bike.
"- But, who is he?"
I think he arrived just last night.
Who's playing this classical music?
I've heard that the new guest is really handsome.
Don't I look handsome?

Anybody here who'd like to know the day of the week they were born?
We can do it that way.
"Of course, I could just make up an answer and you wouldn't know, so I come prepared for that."
I brought with me a book of calendars.
"It goes as far back into the past as 1800, because you never know."
(Laughter)
"I didn't mean to look at you, sir -- you were just sitting there."
(Laughter)
"Anyway, Chris, you can help me out here, if you wouldn't mind."
This is a book of calendars.
Who wanted to know their birth day?
"What year was it, first of all?"
Audience:
1966.
66 -- turn to the calendar with 1966.
And what month?
Audience:

Yes.

Ah yes!
The problem with the supersymmetric parameter lattice...
Dr. Niven:
I think I found a way to express it differently.
Dr. Niven:
I didn't implement it in my analysis code yet but you might like to try it.
Amy:
It looks more complex though.
I don't know if it'll work on my laptop.
Dr. Niven:
"Well, we'll deal with that later if we need to."
Amy:
But I never had the proof.

Frostbite.

He paid me with a five hundred note.
I didn't have change.
So I wrote it on the back.
"He forgot to take the change... hey, it must be him."
Who...?
This one always forgets.
"Sometimes he forgets to buy a ticket, sometimes it's the change."
"At times, he'll go on buying tickets."
He keeps on asking the names of bus stops.
Can you recognise him?
"- Why not... looks a strange sort, keeps his head shaven, has a long scar on the head."
"Every morning at ten, he takes the bus from Hiranandani."
It's nine.
We got an hour to get him.
Come on.

I saw a bitch die， survived by a puppy
I pitied him and lifted him up
He was so hungry he bit off my teat abruptly
The left one is artificial
And you?
The right one， not the left
Wrong， the left side
Right side
I'll go prepare her food before she comes.
She didn't look tired at all.
She was outside all day.
She went to the jail with Sami Amca.
- Jail?
"- Well, I was there as well."
That's how I saw her.
- Good evening.
"- Good evening, how can I help you?"
- Gülten Hanım?
"- Yes, it is me."
"I am Münir Erkut, lawyer."
I told Barış all I had to say.
I don't want anything from him.
I have no demands.
All I want is to divorce as soon as possible.
You didn't have to come all the way here.
I think there's a misunderstanding.
I'm not an attorney to the person you mentioned.
I am Kazım Gencerel's lawyer.
My condolences.
I had not told my daughter about it.
My condolences.
Your father wanted me to give you something.
Please come inside.
Gülten Hanım...
- Do you want me to stay?
"- No, Hüseyin Bey."
Thank you very much.
Come.
"No one from the mansion comes here, right?"
"Don't worry, no one can disturb us here."
- What are you guys doing here?
- Get lost!
Go on!
"- All right, all right!"
"- Dima, let's lure it out."
- One moment.
Stand back.
"Kosmos, get him!"
- He's done for.
- You fail.
"- All right, hold the latch."
Now!
- What did you do that for?
- Kostya?
- Attention!
Listen to this information.
Tomorrow is Parents' Day.
"Tomorrow, my friends, we need to aim for record heights."
Yes.
In being disciplined...
In being orderly...
In being talented.
- Who's missing?
- Inochkin.
- Fill the gap.
"- So, what about talents?"
- I've got three.
- From the entire troop?
"Don't tell me there are no talents among you, my friends."
"Sorry, I don't believe that for a moment."
"- Half a meatball, everyone."
"- And if you can't sing or dance, you can recite a poem."
I think.. you have gone mad.
"Go and find a big stone. okay, sir!"
Why are you all staring at me?
Go and search for a big stone! come on!
Hey!
Who are you?
"Aren""t you ashamed to steal! shoes thief! come on!"
Hey! shoes thief!
What is going on?
Beware if you touched our shoes!
I am sorry.
"I need stone, not shoes."
I need stone!
Why?
Whose skull do you want to break?
"I am not mad that I will break somebody""s skull!"
No need to give justifications!
I have heard about many thieves!
But today I am seeing a fashionable thief!
That too shoes thief!
"Ma""am, talk respectfully!"
"Maybe you don""t know who I am!"
You talk politely!
"lf you talked too much, I will hand you over to the police!"
What do guys nowadays think of themselves?
This is their business!
First BA.
"And when they don""t find a job, they start stealing shoes!"
Nab him!
Hand him over to the police!
Police!
Police!
Connor:
We need to find an elevator to get back to the surface.
Matt:
"Yeah, if James knows where they are..."
James:
"Look, if we follow the tunnels we'll get out."
Kate:
But... what about the people down there?
They could still be alive couldn't they?
Connor:
"Even if they are, there's nothing we can do for them."
Connor:
The best we can do is get out and try and get help.
Kate:
But if the radiation did that to them... then...
James:
No - we're safe now the machine's off.
James:
It's just the ring itself that's radioactive.
We're safe here.
Amy:
"Oh my god, all those people..."
Amy:
How could this happen?
James:
It couldn't have happened.
You can't turn the machine on when there are people down there.
James:
There are interlock systems everywhere.
Matt:
"Well somebody fucked up, and it wasn't me!"
Connor:
"Aigoo, you even fold clothes so well."
"Hey, when I did all this housework, it got so tiring, but now that I have you to talk to."
It's so fun!
Its really true that a person can't live all by themselves
"Yes, it's true."
"Oh, Ha Ni!"
Can you get the laundry from Seung Jo's room?
Tomorrow is Eun Jo's day to take his P.E. outfit.
It seems I have forgotten!
"Sure, I'll be right back"
"You know that closet towards the inside, right?"
I know
OH!
It's the couples T-shirt!
He still has it.
Room for rent
Part time job?
What are you doing in someone else's room?
You came?
She told me to bring Eun Jo's gym clothes.
Then you should have just gotten it and left.
What are you looking through?
"Truthfully, I heard something from Kyung Soo Sunbae."
He said that you might even move out of this house.
"Cham... anyways, he's a little weird, right?"
It's true.
Huh?
I'm going to leave this house.
Why?
What do you mean why?
Do I need to get your permission for that too?
That's not it....
No!
Are you alright?
That fellow has taken a hostage!
We have to get him.
Go!
Seize him!
So you mean... my Eun Hye... ...disappeared while looking for the dead Hong Gil Dong?
She ran out to help Hong Gil Dong.
But she disappeared.
What will we do if she gets hurt while she's with him?
What if she gets caught with him?
I will find her myself. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Your Excellency!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Miss Eun Hye has been taken hostage by thugs!
What?
They're dangerous!
Please send for more men!
They must not be caught!
Eun Hye...!
It's alright now.
Just stay here and then go home.
Let's see.
I must have stepped on a broken piece of pottery.
You got cut.
How did you run in this state?
Because I had to run fast to get you out of danger.
"Young Master, are you alright now?"
Yes.
Why were you so agitated just now?
And what was that about not losing me?
- That was...
- Were you troubled because I was angry at you?
Yes.
lnside
Blow him out
Okay
What happened?

Trying to murder?
We're trying to help only

Damn you!

Don't!
I may get killed before he does

Trying to run?
Use the coat hanger to hook him out
Come on， open his mouth
How's it going?
How's it going?
He's got hooked
Rajesh!
- Now you can keep your gal with you!
"Rajesh, seema is not what you think of her!"
But how come that flower string was with you?
Forget that flower string!
"Believe me, Rajesh! seema is sacred like the Ganges!"
"Marry her, Rajesh!"
Marry her! only you can keep her happy!
And look..

"I don""t accept this wedding!"
"This is not a wedding! lts betrayal! lt""s cheating!"
"I didn""t expect this joke from you!"
"This is not a joke! lts true, Mrs. Dinanath!"
Actually I was going to marry her.
"But when I found out about shekhar and seema""s love.. ..l fulfilled my duty!"
This is not duty!
This is betrayal!

Jack:
"Today is Saturday, the 24th of July."
"For the last three years, I've been away from home to do my degree."
"And as soon as that finished,"
I ended up getting a job at a very demanding company.
So I don't really get to see my old man that much.
"But whenever I do see him, we always go to the same place and do the same thing and have a catch-up."

Jack:
I haven't had time. man:
That tire's fucked.
You'll get done for that.
"Better than me, better than its dad, better than both of us together."
"Please, let it be a girl..."
Why am I acting this way?
Am I a pervert?
"Good night, Princess."
How are things with your boyfriend?
Your boyfriend...
Is it going well?
Did you propose to my sister?
You argued with your boyfriend?
You aren't speaking?
What a dunce.
Did you... propose to my sister?
"Don't worry, don't worry."
I'll find a better boyfriend for you.
You want to...
You want to make up with him...?
"Ah, you need some money?"
I'll give you some.
He really is thick-headed.
Sister-in-law.
I also have...
"I have a worry, too."
But don't...
Don't tell your sister.
Your sister...
Here... flowers...
She wants me to propose like this.
Why'd she hit me?

Mom
- Mom!
- Huh?
Aren't you going to let me out?
What's wrong?
Does your stomach hurt?
No...
I'm okay.
Should I drive?
You don't even have a license.
You know what I mean.
"It's frustrating, unnerving,"
"- scary, sad, and futile."
-What is?
Poverty.
You know how long it's been?
Three years.
"But in those three years, nothing has changed."
I worked here part-time back then and I work here part-time now.
You've changed... you've grown much prettier.
You had no job then and you don't have one now.
"What drives me crazy is, in the future I'll be still here, and you'll be still unemployed."
Do you need a bag?
It costs 50 won.
- The total is 24 dollars and 80 cents.
"-Wait a bit more, give me a chance."
- I know I can do better.
- I've been waiting three years.
Hurry up and pay.
Will this work?
I think so...
Okay.
"All right, all right !"
"- Good hustle, guys."
- Good hustle.
But you can still lose.
You all saw what happened to Oz out there.
I don't want to ever see any of you thinking you're gonna score.
You don't score until you score.
- Until you score.
"- That's right, baby !"
[ Coach ]
It all boils down to today.
"For you seniors, this marks the culmination..."
- of the past four years.
- Culmination.
[ Coach ]
I want you to think about what this means to you.
Do you guys wanna look back on your days at East... and know that you used the time you had ?
"- Hell, yeah !"
- You do !
- Ah !
"Good attitude, Ostreicher."
"- Good luck, fellas."
"Christ, I didn't tell ya to leave the game."
"I'm sorry, Coach."
"You got someplace more important to be, Ostreicher ?"
Yeah.
Ostreicher !
Oz ?
Fuckface ?
[ Coach ]
Ostreicher !
He calls himself God.
I can see him.
He can see you.
"My name's Krishna, your new neighbour."
Neighbour?
Neighbour?
The person Kanji had mortgaged his house to.. ..has sold it to me.
Here are the documents.
"And, Kanji bhai, sorry for that joke about God."
What's this?
How can he sell my house to him?
I was about to pay him on time.
I already paid him.
This isn't done.
This is my house.
Nobody can just buy it.
Relax.
Chill.
"When you get your compensation from God.. ..you can repay me, I will leave."
"And anyway, I always leave after my project is over."
Why buy the house when you want to leave?
Are you a agent?
I am not that low.
I've a consultancy firm.
I give advice to people.

Come with me later to report your brother's disappearance.
What's the matter?
Is something wrong?
There's blood there.
Where?
"The car's beat up, but blood?"
Okay.
I'll take it away.
- You'll take it the way it is?
- Thanks.
Well...

Please hold the line.
Rio Grande...

God!
My God!
God?.
"You communists spend half your lives trying to prove God doesn't exist and when things go wrong, you call his name."
But he won't hear you because you're on the wrong side.
"Dad, please don't hurt me."
I'm your daughter.
What's that?
You're my daughter?
My daughter Malena is 6 years old and she's at home with my wife.
You are not my daughter.
You're just a subversive piece of shit.
We're here to educate you people.
"Yes, sir!"
"What""s your age?"
"- 32, sir!"
32?
"- Yes, sir!"
What was your age when you joined the police force?
"32, sir!"
32?
"- Yes, sir!"
How long have you been in police service?
"- 32, sir! strange!"
How did you get stuck at 32?
"Yes, sir!"
"Yes, sir!"
You must have read about Bheesma Pitama in Ramayana!
"Not in Ramayana, I had read about him in Mahabharat."
"But you read it in lndia itself. sir, his age was 275 years."
"And the secret of his long life was that.. ..he was a bachelor like me. sir, you should count a person""s real age after his marriage."
You are right!
You are an interesting man!
"Yes, sir! sir, shall I come with you?"
"No! lf you want, you can go and.."
"Yes, sir!"
Now it is too late!
Did you patch up with your beloved?
That is not a problem.
"But her unlucky papa, he interferes a lot, boss!"
"Boss, give me such an idea.. such an idea.."
That he stops interfering!
"Yes, boss!"
He should be completely defeated!
What does her father wants?
What sight of love did you cast on me!
You made my plight bad.
Even beautiful face is a vice.
My heart is yours.
I promise you.
My heart is yours.
I promise you.
I understand your intentions.
I have already studied the book of heart.
What sight of love did you cast on me!
You made my plight bad.
Even beautiful face is a vice.
People only cast evil sight.
What sight of love did you cast on me!
Greetings.
- Greetings.
Good!
- Good!
Good!
- Good! sheikh has sent the diamonds for us!
Give it to me!
I will deliver it to Tiger singh in switzerland.
These diamonds are mine!
"Don""t forget that!"
My sweet love!
Hasan!
"Don""t deceive sir!"
Why are you inviting trouble?
"lf Tiger singh found out, he will not spare you!"
Get lost!
Hey!
"Don""t aggravate the matter!"
- You must be bored here.
- I'm not bored.
Sashka Belykh gave me a book of magic tricks.
I've been practising.
"Wanna see the""Flying Queen?"""
- Sure!
- That's where you are!
Snitches!
"- Who, we?"
- And your stupid flowers!
- Can't trust you with a secret!
- Who told Dynin?
- You are the snitches!
- We?
- Who else?
Who took the mirror and Shagalova to Dynin?
- They're not out there just killing for fame.
- They just wanna be famous.
- They should be in every major city.
- Every major city.
These guys are playing God.
"I mean, this whole religious twist?"
Who the hell do they think they are?
"Hell yeah, I believe in capital punishment!"
If they let me I'll pull the switch.
Get 'em all!
Kill 'em all!
"I'm all for it... because the more people they kill, the better it is for everybody"
"No, ...you don't even know!"
- Sign me up man.
- Sign me up.
- Where can I sign up?
"That was because I felt like you were doing the wrong thing, not because I hated you."
"We're friends, that's why I..."
I took care of Choi Chul Joo.
The girls have all been returned to their parents.
And Choi Chul Joo... paid for his crimes.
Did you do it?
That's great!
"Well done, Young Master!"
I always knew you were a good person!
You're smiling!
Look at that!
"If you do good, you'll smile automatically!"
Look at how nice you look when you smile!
That's enough.
Fine.
You're so stiff.
Why did you hug me like that just now?
"Young Master, do you...?"
Did any suspicious men come for you?
How did you know that?
- Then what happened?
- Suspicious men did come for me.
Who are you?
Are you Heo Yi Nok?
"That's right. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Yi Nok, what are you doing?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Send him away!
I...
I'm so full that I've laid down.
How did they...?
"My granddaughter has never been full in her life, you fools!"
That's fortunate.
I'm really lucky.
It doesn't have to fall on you.
The coffin is spelled shut.
That makes it a witch problem.
So it does fall on me.
I was bound to see my mother again sooner or later.
Sooner.
"Abby Bennett Wilson, Monroe, North Carolina."
"Born in Mystic Falls hospital, graduated Mystic Falls High, blah, blah, blah."
A little compulsion helps to speed up the research process.
This is her.
"Yep, road trip."
I call shotgun.
"Yeah, no."
Why?
You want me to hang out in the back with you?
"You're not coming, Damon."
Why?
I'm the one who found her.
"Ok, Damon, look,"
Bonnie hasn't seen her mom in over 15 years.
We don't need your snarky commentary narrating the experience.
What's going on with you two?
We kissed.
Now it's weird.
Have a great trip.
What are you doing here?
I came to apologize.
Apologize?
You bit me.
I could have died.
"I think we're way past apologies, Tyler."
That's the problem.
Look there.
Gods are bare-bodied.
Like this.
They're never fully covered.
"That's your wedding photo, right?"
- Yes.
Wearing that traditional attire.
"So, did you only wear a traditional attire.. ..since your wedding?"
"No, right?"
- No.
See.
That's our older image.
"Conch in one hand, mace in the other."
Where are yours?
"lf I keep holding them all day, won't my arms hurt?"
Think.
"Actually, our latest photos haven't been updated on Facebook."
"People still use the older ones, and we let them."
We don't have a problem.
- Let them.
- That's enough.
You're boring me now.
"Get out, leave."
Mahadev!
- Mahadev!
- Only you can hear and see me.
"Yes, coming."
Coming.
Mahadev!
What happened?
"What happened, Kanji?"
See him.
Feels loyal to Klaus because Klaus' blood created him.
He released me from a curse that was ruining my life.
I owe him for that.
I need you to bite your girlfriend.
A hybrid bite would kill a vampire.
Consider this me putting your undying loyalty to the test.
Klaus can't control me.
Not when it comes to you.
Ahhh.
Oh!
"Oh, no."
Did you just...Bite me?!
Caroline!
Get away from me!
I figured out how to open it.
Can you?
Let me out!
Please!
"Oh, my God, oh, my God."
Hey!
I'm in here!
I'm in here!
I'm in here!
I've been having these dreams for days now.
It's like the witches are trying to send me a message.
I just can't believe you guys have kept this from me this whole time.
"Stefan thought if you knew where the coffins were,"
Klaus could threaten people to get the information out of you.
So these are the rest of his family?
"Yeah, Elijah and two others."
Now this one...
Is the one we can't open.
"Jackie is injured, sir."
He can't go much far.
He must be somewhere nearby.
D'souza!
Wherever he's...
I can't return home until I find him.
You... sir?!
"- Yes, I..."
Now I'll bring Jackie dead.

"Mustafa, this girl is very beautiful, too."
But...
There is pain in her eyes.
Have you burned this girl?
She burned you?
"No, I don't believe that..."
"These eyes have learned to get burned,  they don't know how to burn."
"These looks are not the ones that burn,  they are the ones that get burned."
Narin?!
I'm here...
"Narin, where are you?"
"This is my fate, Yasar..."
To look at Mustafa from a distance.
"I won't be able to be beside him until I die, but..."
I will always look at my husband from a distance...
Like this...
I will always look at my husband.
You haven't been eating...
They said so...
You should eat...
Think of your child...
Narin...
Where have you been?
"Where have you been, Narin?"
"I have been in the hell that you put me, Mustafa... (Singing in Kurdish)"
You are a rose

You are the light of my soul

- She wasn't that bad.
- What?
Telling the only cool boy in Eastbourne I have flatulence issues is okay?
I don't think he took any notice.
"And, anyway, he was well into you before your mum came in."
- Do you think so?
- Yeah.
You were great asking him about his band and stuff.
"- And he likes cats, like me."
- Yep.
Did you see the way Tom held onto my hand a little too much
- when he gave me the onions?
- He didn't!
He is so gorgeous!
They're both beyond the Valley of the Gorgeous.
"Oh, are you sure my mum hasn't ruined it?"
"Oh, GG, it was really fab."
- Fabbity fab?
- With knobs on.
And Robbie will understand.
All parents say stupid things.
He'll probably like you more 'cause he'll feel bad you've got a mum that's beyond bonkerdom.
You're right.
"God, Robbie's just so muscley and dreamy and..."
"- Tom said, ""See you later."""
- I know.
So did Robbie.
- What exactly does that mean?
- I'm not sure.
Do you think Tom says that to everyone
"like a sort of ""See you later"" sort of thing?"
No.
Wait!
"Hey, hey, hey!"
"Aw, Mike!"
"Michael, we love you."
"Okay, everybody."
That's a wrap.
- Good day.
- Where are we from?
From Galanta.
"My name is Katka Szabová, I'm from Galanta,"
I'm 26 years old.
Are you nervous?
- Of course.
- Can we help you anyhow?
"- Sorry, but you will sing?"
- Me.
"(Ja - German word for ""yes"")"
- Ich verstehe.
"- Also gut dann, na ja."
Do you think you can sing?
"Of course, I also think I can sing."
"All right, we will finish this discussion after the performance."
We should not dig into it any further.
Here you go!
"No art, no skill, just a feeling, but for me it belongs to those who perform or entertain, they can't do much, only create an atmosphere, but here she took too much."
She did not.
- That's the kind of people.
- She did.
"Katka, I want to say, that Paľo pushed this."
I just want the good for you.
Let me ask: would anybody of you pay for this?
We're not here in some singing school.
"I beg your pardon, but when is today?"
I don't care about today!
It's boring!
Every day - it is today.
How do we cope with that?
Can it be that one day Time will stop and we will say:
Yesterday is every morning.
Life is awfully boring.
"Life is awfully boring, Yesterday is every morning."
"Let tomorrow come today, It is where we hurry."
"Let the future come our way, - Then we wouldn't worry."
Don't you see that everything around belongs tomorrow?
Don't you feel the future has already come?
"lf the future had come, now it would have been... the New Year!"
The New Year?
The New Year?
Let it be the New Year!
"What, what New Year?"
The New Year doesn't come just like that.
You have to see it in.
Then let's!
"Let's, let's see it in!"
Let's!
"I'd say, why don't we really see it in?"
"It is so pleasant, my friends, to see in the New Year."
Very pleasant.
How?
How?
How shall we see it in?
"To see in the New Year, we need, first of all, a Christmas tree."
"Secondly, Santa Claus."
"And, last but not least, the Snow Maiden."
Take it.
Separation Agency
Stop sighing at the ground!
Stop sighing at the sky.
I guess she doesn't want to see you.
Really?
Ask her to call me later.
Huh?
He understood.
She likes you a lot.
Don't worry.
"No, it's okay."
I'll eat dinner at home.
By myself.
I'll just go.
See you.
You're not the one who got burned.
Why are you hiding?
Leave me alone.
Why are you being so childish?
How long will you hide there?
I said leave me alone!
"Don't just yell for help, you need to help him first."
At least you can say &amp;amp;quot;l love you.&amp;amp;quot;
You're better off than me.
Su-Eun.
You know why I wanted him to propose to me?
It was all for him.
If he confessed his love and thought about marriage and such.
"Then, he could think about me once more before jumping into the fire and make him a bit more scared of the fire I thought I could change him."
That's how it started but now
I've become sort of fixated on it.
No more bedroom!
"Hello, Mr. Rajesh!"
"- How are you, Mr. Diwan?"
I am fine.
You tell me.

Got it? - okay!
Where is shekhar?
"He has gone to Alibagh to meet his wife. shekhar, look at your state."
Why do you wander around like this?
"Why don""t you surrender yourself to the police?"
At least you will feel at peace.
Peace?
"That""s why l have always helped.. ..the police in the name of patriotism. seema.. now what I am doing.. ..l am doing it for peace of my mind."
That day is not far away when you will take my name with pride.
Beware!

There's a huge grudge between us.
"Remember her."""
Are you Shu Baifeng?
Miss Mu.
"I admire your boldness, but you can't address me by my full name."
Don't you have any manners?
I can't disobey my mother.
My mother once said:
"Should I see her enemy Shu Baifeng, ...I must kill her."
Who is your mother?
Qin Hongmian.
Then it's your mess.
Leave us.
Yes.
You too.
What a resemblance!
I should have known... with your personality.
What are you talking about?
Follow me.
How do you know Yi Yang Finger?
That's my father's exclusive style.
That's the master stroke of our Tuan Family.
Hasn't your mother told you?
You stole it from my father.
Don't make up any excuse.
"Call Tuan Yu out, we must put an end to this."
Lady.
You can never marry my son.
You forgot your word.
I want to hear this from him.
He can't see you right now.
I cannot stand it any more.
I will marry you tomorrow itself.
Why do you look like that?
I am giving you time only till the marriage hour.
You must change not only your mind ...
That will never happen.
- It will happen.
Never.
Cant you hear?
Dont you know the fate of Ravana who kidnapped Sita?
Open your eyes atleast now.
Hey Ravana!
Get ready for the war.
Change the story.
Are you Rama?
Take the nuptials from Sitas neck and give them to Ravana.
He will tie them.
Are you mad?
Why will Rama remove Sitaa nuptials.
"Hey, remove the nuptials."
"- Sir, it is a sacrilege."
It is a sin.
Did you see this?
The power went off.
This is a bad omen.
What nonsense?
Inquire what happened.
Maybe lord Rama has come.
"Hey you, come here."
Did you check everything?
Yes we checked all the fuses.
Now check the transformer.
"Wow, it is cold."
I heard it's supposed to be really hot here.
I always envisioned this place with the sun shining all the time...
- It rained today.
- Cool.
None
- Let's go over there.
- There's nothing here.
"Board shop, board shop!"
I like this.
None
None
You know Dropkick Murphys?
Dropkick Murphys!
My ideal girl looks good simply in a white top and blue jeans.
This is the perfect size.
I only bought one pair of shoes.
I'm picking out clothes now.
"I have to buy a board, a board."
All done.
Zelo is very excited right now.
Zelo!
Don't I look silly?
Can I see how I look?
My hair got short all of a sudden.
"For this album, I was going for a different look"
"With an American feel, in general."
So I cut my hair real short for a unique styling.
"lf I don't style this hair and go out,"
Then I look kind of foolish.
I've always tried to cover my ugly face with hair.
So I grew my hair out but now I can't even do that.
You cannot claim insurance in such cases.
Because these are natural calamities.
But I don't believe in God.
Tell him.
I don't care if you do or don't.
You're signatures are right here.
I am so sorry.
Sorry?
What sorry?
Sir.
"Sir, I've invested my entire earnings in the shop."
Even my house is mortgaged.
And you're saying sorry.
"I know, but your claim cannot be approved."
You may go now.
"No, sir."
I won't leave until my claim isn't approved.
Security.
Sir..
"Sir, why are you calling security?"
I'm talking to you decently.
"- Yes, sir."
"Take him away, please."
- Why call the security..
Come on.
- Just a minute.
Just a minute.
Come on.
You just know how to swindle our money.
Mind your language.
You should be publicly beaten.
Throw him out.
You think I killed my ex-boyfriend?
I think psychopaths are incredibly high-maintenance.
"If you care about your friend, go figure out how Alaric came into the icu on his deathbed and walked out an hour later without a scratch."
Fair enough.
I can't.
I can't.
Try harder.
Can't he just rest for one second?!
"We're doing this my way, Caroline."
"If you can't handle it, you should go."
"He's right, Caroline."
Just go.
No!
Tyler!
"Go, Caroline."
What are you doing?
"What the hell, man?"
Does it bother you?
Knock it off!
Good.
Get angry.
It's in you.
You know it is.
I said knock it off!
Your bond to Klaus is putting my daughter in danger.
"Now either you turn or I kill you right here, right now."
"You've grown into such a beautiful young woman, Bonnie."
"Please, just stop with the muffins and the compliments."
I just want to know the truth...
Why didn't you come home?
I had no magic.
"I was in a new city, and I realized"
You want to ruin our country by selling the gold to the enemy!
"No, kaka sir! sher khan will lay down his life for his country!"
"But he won""t let this happen!"
Take the reward for your patriotism!
"John, Basheer will be at the port with the truck!"
Go and check! kaka sir!
- Yes!
We had already given the instructions.
That he should be at Aaram port with the truck!
"Pinto, you will remain a fool."
"You won""t understand anything. come on! come with me! oh God!"
"Pinto.. its not good to interfere. kaka sir, what are you talking about?"
Fool!
This gold is worth crores.
And John is no longer required.
Just think.
"You risked your life, you locked horns with Tiger singh.. ..and did this great job."
And John should get his share for doing nothing?
Now think.
"What is the need of John? oh! kaka sir, now I understood."
"We don""t need him!"
- Yes!
Tiger singh!
You are alive!
Good!
Good that you have come!
That Pinto shot John!
You are intelligent!
Use your brains!
Take advantage of this golden chance.
Become rich.
Let this launch go.
This is my first visit ever to the city.
-Really?
"-Yes, I swear to God."
But my son is living here in the city.
He is married to a lady from a very wealthy family... ...and he has an amazing child.
"Wait, I will show you his picture."
His name is Hamada.
See how cute he is?
How old is he?
A year and 6 months.
God wills.
He is cute like his grandmother.
This was in the past.
"You know, I have never seen him."
And he also gave me a hard time... ...till he gave me a picture of him.
When he come to visit me I asked him... ...why didn't you bring your son and wife?
He answer travelling makes my wife tired.
"Here I am, a very old lady... ...but people helped me to catch the train and come... ...and my son waited for me in the station."
But there is nothing we can say.
It's noday's lady's.
"By the way, what's your name?"
-Abdallah.
-God bless you.
You look handsome and have a good taste.
Thank you.
"Look, I will show you something... ...and tell me your opinion honestly."
Show me.
I got it for my daughter-in-law... ...and I am afraid that she don't like it.
"But tell me honestly, don't lie at me."
So beautiful.
Seriously.
"Yes, I swear it is beautiful."
I'll take a shower and go out.
"Okay, as you wish."
"- Good morning, sir."
- Good morning.
"Lawyer Necati Bey called twice, sir."
Thanks.
Good morning.
"Yes, yes, I just woke up."
So how did the trial go?
"Unfortunately, we didn't get the decision we hoped for."
- What?
- The lawyer took into account the last developments.
Until Mirza Çeltik's investigation is over... ... he was released by the court pending the trial.
So is he... is he free now?
God damn it!
He can't leave the country though.
Who cares if he can't go out of the country?
Is he out there and free now or not?
Aleykum selam... aleykum selam.
What are you doing here?
And how did you get in here?
What is going on?
What do you think you are doing?
How did you get inside?
"Come, let us have a talk with you."
What are we gonna talk about?
This was for Cemre.
Barış Bey!
Get up!
Don't!
Come here.
I had made you an advance payment before the trial... ...
Come on.
- I see.
"Call him, call him."
Where is he?
I have a even fresh matter today.
I will call him.
Grandpa.
Grandpa.
"Tanya, hi."
You didn't tell me that your grandpa is Albert Einstein.
"Shut up, okay."
My grandpa means everything to me.
"18 years ago when there was an earthquake in Indonesia.. ..my mom, dad.. - Do all scientists.. ..get their haircut in the same saloon?"
I will kill you.
Bunty.
Come on.
Grandpa.
How is my child?
"Grandpa, he's Bunty."
I am Gonsalves.
Anthony Gonsalves.
"- Hello, sir."
"Sir, what is this?"
This.
This is a time machine.
A machine that will connect us with our past.. ..and make our future better.
"A machine that will break the sound barrier.. ..and take us back, I mean to our past."
Time machine?
"Professor, they are are just film fiction."
"How can you make a time machine in reality, professor?"
"It can be made, we can make, we can make."
If we can see the past then we can also travel into the past.
After that?
- Weather report.
Who will give that report?
Gali Ganna Rao.
If we call him he can tell when it will rain.
9848032919.
This is my cell number.
Gali Ganna Rao.
This is my name.
People always misunderstand me and feel.. ..that I give them wrong information.
I only read the report given by the weather department.. ..but dont control the weather myself.
It will be good if you understand that.
Please call later.
Ok?
Catch!
"Sir, we are in trouble."
We did not still get the report which.. ..we are supposed to get by now.
- What shall we do?
Oh!
I see that you are new to the job.
You dont know about me.
Do you think that we depend fully on their report?
Now select one finger.
The pointing finger?
There will be no rain.
Go.
"Sir, there is a phone for you."
Who is that?
- A fan of yours.
This is Gali Ganna Rao speaking.
This is Gun the Gagan speaking.
Are you the person who gives the weather-related news?
One wrong step from your side. ...can harm your daughter's honour as well as life.
Your enemy Jackie.
"Damodar, tell him something."
Have patience!
Your anger can risk her life.
"Before that I'll kill all of them, Damodar."
She's my daughter.
"She's not only yours, but all of us' daughter."
Give this to me.
Come to your senses.
"Aunt, reason him something."
Don't play with the laws and trust me.
After all I too have some duties towards this family.
I'll bring Radha back.
You please control him.
I'll call the police.
God!
What has happened?
Pasha!
Today you've challenged me.
I'll not spare you and your son alive.
IG Shreekant!
Now you'll understand my language.
"Well done, Jackie!"
You are lying.
You are not a police officer.
"Listen, try and understand."
- You are a liar.
I don't want to hear a word from you.
Get lost!
"Otherwise, I'll kill you."
I said leave.
Hello...
I obtained permission for each one of you.
"There is not going to be any restrictions on the number of visitors, despite Mustafa's illness."
What illness?
We all know why he is here!
Okay...
Duriye..
Metin didn't say anything.
"That is, he is just saying it is protocol."
My son!!!
My son...
Son...
Son....
It is time for medication..
"Mustafa, son.. where are you going?"
We came to see you..
"Look, Asiye is here.."
Yasar is here...
Your mother...
Your father...
"You say that, but Mustafa doesn't recognize you."
We are going
My son....
How could they do this to you... how????
We... ... are such a burden to you..
If only Kadir could get out.. ... we won't stay...
"And, you won't even let us do any work."
We just sit around.
You are not a burden to anyone.
I am going to ask you something...
Are you not comfortable here?
Is the place too small?
Why are you giving Demet's letter to Kuzey?
- It will get on his nerves.
- What is it to you?
It's her who wanted me to do it.
How shameless of her to  write to him after what she did.
"Have you no shame, talking behind her back without know what really happened?"
"Isn't Demet your friend, too?"
"You're one of a kind, Cemre."
"You talk about shame, yet... ... you are here for your lover, as a married woman."
- You are really unbelievable.
- So are you.
"- Kuzey Tekinoğlu, right?"
- Yes.
Anything else?
"Well, three letters."
But I can give them to him.
You'll have to leave them here.
They will reach him once we check them.
Is that so?
Alright.
- The visiting room is upstairs.
- Thank you.
- Sami Tekinoğlu.
- You can sit.
Are we going to see him together?
- You will do as you were told.
- I was told nothing.
- Neither was I. - It's 15 minutes.
You want to see him separately?
"No, I will see my son for as long as I am allowed."
He can wait outside if he wants.
"Okay, we got it."
"I feel strong, you know."
"And clouds really should be white at least, and oceans should be there at the beach."
And who needs books when we've got speech?
And who knows what's in store for raw love?
"Life, a penny at a time."
"Oh, love, life a penny at a time."
"Love, life a penny at a time."
"Oh, love."
"[fireworks whistling, popping]"
man speaking native language:
"When I close my eyes,"
"I can see all different people in the world from town to town, from country to country."
"I can feel it, I can touch it, I can see it."
I feel like born again because of my haircut.
It's time to continue my journey.
man:
Who do you love?
Cathy:
"My silly boys, the Bobby-ells."
Okay.
What do you fear? man:
"Well, I guess..."
I'm fearless now.
"I guess my fear was that you'd get cancer, and you did."
"That you'd get it again, I mean."
And you did.
But it's over with.
So I'm fearless.
[haunting music]
[overlapping chatter]
[thunder rumbling]
woman:
Go.
"Please, I need this job."
You're fired.
"Look, give me another chance."
You're fired.
"Parker, hello."
You're fired.
Why?
Dogs catching Frisbees?
Pigeons in the park?
A couple geezers playing chess?
Boss.
Not now.
The Bugle could show another side of New York for a change.
"We got six minutes to deadline, Jonah."
We need page one.
I don't pay you to be a sensitive artiste.
I pay you...
Still not now!
I pay you because that psycho Spider-Man will pose for you.
He won't let me take any more pictures.
You turned the whole city against him.
A fact I'm very proud of.
Get your pretty little portfolio off my desk before I go into a diabetic coma.
"Is your wife, she lost her checkbook."
Thanks for the good news.
"Please, isn't there any of these shots you can use?"
I need the money.
Miss Brant.
Get me a violin.
"Five minutes to deadline, Jonah."
Run a picture of a rancid chicken.
There is only one way we can reach the ship.
We have to go underwater!
"But if we do that, we may freeze!"
I'm prepared to die!
"If we make a hole in the ship, they will have to delay!"
You're right.
Here!
They made this for us to help us breathe underwater.
Young Sook!
Mother is going!
God of the Sea!
We are laying down our lives to save our daughter!
Please have mercy!
We... we made a hole in the ship!
It's our turn now!
Let's go!
What?
We can't leave today because of a hole in the ship?!
It will take at least a day to repair it.
"As of today, you owe me forty thousand yang."
"Goodness, awesome!"
Increase security!
"Seize any trespassers and torture them! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Yes, sir!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
In Soon!
Next!
- Choon Dang!
- Myung Shin!
The front has been fortified.
Go for the back!
Alright!
What do we do?
It's fifty thousand yang already!
"Bye, Bye, Seeya!"
Is this enough for my sister-in-law's birthday?
-Sister-in-law?
-Yeah.
-Who?
-Su-eun.
Since when has my sister been your sister-in-law?
We're not even married.
You who don't even have to propose...
Su-eun told me to call her that.
You're on your period aren't you?
Should I cook seaweed soup for her birthday?
I'm good at it.
"You fry up the beef, add a dash of sesame oil, you boil it with soaked seaweed... fantastic!"
She'll like it.
What do you think?
Let's rest a bit.
"It's hard on you, isn't it?"
Of course.
You make me carry these heavy bags.
Not that!
Then what?
Don't you think you can take it easy?
- I am taking it easy now.
- You've been doing it a long time.
And worked harder than anyone.
What was that?
It means &amp;amp;quot;l love you forever.&amp;amp;quot;
Doesn't it?
Sister-in-law taught me.
"It means, &amp;amp;quot;l love you, so let me touch your breasts!&amp;amp;quot;"
Huh?
Where do I live?
"- Jaipur, aunt."
So I am speaking from Jaipur.
But your voice sounds quite clear.
"So why are you yelling, you fool."
"Aunt, father has said.. ..that we should speak louder on a trunk call."
He's a fool.
Maybe you might know better.
But he will kill me.
If he misbehaves.. ..then throw him out of the house.
"But.. aunt, won't that be a bit too much?"
- No.
He drives my mother crazy.
But isn't your mother dead?
I am talking about my mother.
Don't you and father have the same mother?
"Oh, no."
He's the servant's son.
After the servant died my mother raised him.
What?
My father is the servant's son?
That means I am a servant's grandchild.
Ask Bhikhu.
Bhikhu knows about it.
- Yes.
Bhikhu is your father's brother.
"The servant of my cruel, low-down, scoundrel neighbour.. ..is my uncle?"
"Kishen, aren't you ashamed to abuse your neighbours?"
"Why shouldn't I, aunt, why shouldn't I?"
"The mother's a witch, the daughter's a specter."
"You know, last month.. ..they pulled down my father's loincloth."
Do you know that?
I will give you the rest of the payment today.
"Oh you were hungry too, right?"
Here!
Come here!
Don't call the police.
I will kill him right here  if you call the police or the security.
I was put in jail because of him.
"Come here, come."
Lion...
Get up.
Fight me like a man.
You were doing stuff behind my back.
Why don't you hit me once?
"Slap me once, just once."
"Hit me once to wind me up, come on!"
Get up.
We are not finished yet.
Get up.
May God accept your prayers.
I first found out that Mirza Çeltik's deceased son was your boyfriend.
And then I found his grave.
Then I tracked the fresh flowers brought here everyday.
And here I am before you.
Hello Komiser.
"You know Kuzey was released today, right?"
Mirza Çeltik doesn't have many days ahead.
You are trying to close Ferhat's case.
Why would I want that?
For the same reason you come here everyday with flowers.
I am not doing anything.
I will prove it.
I will prove it.
Millwall!
Millwall!
- What the fuck's he doing here?
"- Martin, sit down, son, sweet."
- That's it.
"Do as you're told, you mug."
- Fuck off.
Bovver.
You know we're gonna have to stop meeting like this.
People are gonna start to talk.
"So, what you doing up so late, anyway, on a fucking school night?"
Shouldn't you be at home with your pals... ...all shitting at the thought of us turning you over?
"What, did you have a lover's tiff?"
"Well, what do you want, Bov?"
Fucking Yank's an undercover journo.
He's at our boozer now.
"Tommy, you gotta give him the chop."
He's got them eating out of the palm of his hand.
"What makes you think I'd want to sort that out for you, eh?"
Because the Major's there too.
Stevie Dunham's in there?
"- Oh, thanks, Pete."
- Shut up!
History student my ass.
Who the fuck are you?
"Look, I'm sorry I lied about being a history major, but that's it."
- I'm not a journalist.
"- Well, it don't look fucking good, does it?"
- Why are you keeping a record?
- It's a journal.
I've kept that my entire life.
Are you working for the Times?
Why did you send her there?
What was she doing at your mom's house?
"What did you do to my daughter, tell me!- It's okay dear, okay..."
Mira?!...
Yaman did you take the exam?
Yaman did you take the exam?
"No, I came to you..."

So I went to the hospital.
And I found out that the girl had an affair with Kerim.
Lies!
Don't give me bullshit!
Tell me the truth!
You just don't want to see the truth.
The real lie is what you see here.
This rape slander.
It's too much.
"Well... ...congrats on the Epstein account, Van Holden."
That should be a nice commish.
I bet your father's election had nothing to do with it.
"Fuck you very much, Todd."
"Gentlemen, if you will excuse me... ...I must partake, once again, in this restaurant's fine facilities."
Fucking lucky bastard.
What the fuck.
Matt Buckner?
Is that you?
"Jesus, Matt, you look like shit."
"Hey, Buckner, do you mind?"
- You said you'd hook me up.
- What?
"When I took the fall for you at Harvard, you said you'd hook me up."
"You gotta be kidding me, man."
"They were your drugs, and you said you had more to lose..."
- ...and that you'd hook me up if-- - All right!

I'll take a beautiful picture.
Stop smiling.
"Now, here we go."
Do you know where he is going?
Maybe New York or Paris.
Maybe we should make them meet before he leaves.
You know why none of the Dwarves hooked up with Snow White?
They couldn't tell her how they felt.
Not one!
They were all ashamed of being dwarves.
In fact...
"In fact, Snow White had a thing for short guys."
"When the Prince dismounted from his horse, he was goddamned... uh really short."
"This is a secret, but actually he was the youngest."
"The eighth, who was adopted away."
You know why the bitchy queen died so miserably?
She was tricked by the mirror!
"When you look at your sweetheart, you don't look with a mirror, you look with your heart."
What's all this about?
It doesn't suit you.
It's too heavy.
Hi!
What are you doing here?
I have something to say.
What is it?
I'll tell you later.
- Can't you say it now?
- Later.
"Oh, I better go."
I'll call you then.
I'll be waiting for you!
Hello.
Please don't freeze me!
Please...
One Snow Maiden won't make a New Year celebration.
There.
And I say - it will.
Absolutely!
Today the Snow Maiden Will visit girls and boys.
"And she will bring them presents, And she will bring them toys."
So you are determined to see in the New Year?
Yes!
And you no longer need the old year?
"No, we don't!"
"Go ahead, see it in then."
But mind you: the little elephant will miss out on his Birthday.
How is that?
Why?
"He hasn't celebrated his Birthday this year, right?"
He hasn't.
And he won't.
Because you don't need this year any more.
But how will he do without his Birthday?
I wanted to give him ripe bananas as a Birthday present.
There won't be any ripe bananas either.
They'll stay green.
"My friends, I think we rushed events a bit."
And how!
"Why see in the next New Year, when there's still so much interesting left in this year?"
Sweet bananas and pineapples.
Oh yes.
And my Birthday.
Then the future hasn't come yet?
Not yet.
And when it comes back to me--
"And believe me, mate, it fucking does, that madness."
"I mean, when I hear, you know, the--"
"The roar of the stadium on match day, yeah, all the lads calling me down... ...to get pissed out of me fucking tree."
When I think of that... ...I think about getting back into it.
"And Shannon and Ben, they remind me."
There's more to life than all this.
"Get all those juicy details, mate?"
- Writing it all down?
- What?
- You fucking journo cunt!
- Oi!
Oi!
Oi.
- Sure you know what you're doing?
- He's fucking undercover!
- Don't tell him nothing!
"- I said, are you sure?"
What?
You already knew.
"All I know is he studied journalism, right, at Harvard."
But he's dropped out.
We found his journal.
Full of stories about all of us.
That's just a fucking diary.
Ned saw you at the Times with a couple of journos.
That was my dad.
He's the journalist.
You knew that.
"His old man's a fucking journo, and you knew about it."
"- Look, that don't mean nothing, Bov."
- You what?
"When I was at the war front, he saved my life once  so I brought him back and treat him like my own son."
You've ruined his hunting game.
Let's go.
Now.
I'm so afraid. * sarcastically *
What?
A prince?
He is nothing but a thug!
You are unworthy of being here!
You there!
Take your hands off of him.
What have I done to deserve this?
Are you saying even the deer is first for the prince?
Why you still...!
Take him out and lock him in the storage.
Yes sir.
"Is that you, Kwon-yoo?"
Please forgive me.
I've wrong you by not teaching the lower ones.
Please forgive me.
I told you to stay away from here 'til he leaves.
What?
What are you worried about?
Don't worry.
I hear you are not reading lately.
Is it true that you your time is consumed by hunting?
I was trying to broaden my view like  others by not focusing on study alone...
Was I really asking you that?
What is the reason you keep going to the Shin family's house?
Is it because of his daughter?
Only the Shin family...
She is the first one that I like...
Thank you.
Good day.
"Oh, I wish I didn't come here."
"Don't say that, I'm glad you are with Sami Amca today."
Sami Amca.
- How is Kuzey?
Is he well?
- He's alright.
- How is his morale?
- Make a guess.
Everyone has their own problems.
- He's not sick or something I hope?
"- No, thank God."
But he's not in good spirit either.
Don't worry you.
Look...
"He will be out soon, anyway."
The toughest part is over.
How do we know that?
The other man's case is a different one.
There's something about this place.
It fills me with hopelessness.
"No, don't say that, Sami Amca."
Try to think good things and good things will happen.
Kuzey will be free after the first trial and we all welcome him.
He will be with you in your nikah.
"Inshallah, did you give him the letters?"
I left them with the warden they need to control them first.
- Of course.
"- Okay then, let's go."
"""Every soul will taste death"""
"Kazım Beyefendi, in his last trip... ... asks for two things from you, our dear community."
"Bonnie, you're about to see your mom for the first time in 15 years."
I'm not letting anyone ruin that moment.
"Yeah, but he's going to keep at it until I pick up."
Fine.
What?
Where are you?
Bonnie and I are going to spend the night at the lake house while we wait for sheriff Forbes to give us some more addresses.
"You're kidding me, right?"
"No, Stefan, I'm not."
We need a night off from your insanity.
Klaus is getting antsy.
He knows I'm stalling him.
We need to move faster.
"Well, we're doing everything we can."
So could you maybe not call every 5 minutes?
"Sure, Elena."
Whatever you say.
How's life on the road?
- Scenic.
- How's life in Mystic Falls without any hybrids?
Boring.
For now.
"If you want any of us back, you just have to say the word."
There's no need.
I've been making friends with the town's civil servants.
"There's a deputy who's awfully chatty, but useful nonetheless."
Are you clear on what you need to do?
I've got it covered.
Can I help you?
Abby Bennett Wilson?
That's me.
Cute house.
Front side of the building Don't move
I'm five seconds away 4 seconds 3... 2...
What are you doing here?
Huh?
Are you okay?
I thought you were going to propose!
I thought you wanted a nice dinner in a fancy restaurant.
And we never play games with fires.
How could you not know that?
What?
"Hey, Lee Jin-woo..."
The movie's starting.
Shhhh.
"Hwi-chan, look at me."
Did you do your homework?
Then you better go home right away and do it.
Don't play on the computer.
"Do the homework first, okay?"
I have to stay here for a few days.
"You'll be fine on your own, right?"
You won't?
When have I ever not been alone?
"Yes, my Hwi-chan can do great on his own."
Your mom will do well too.
And I'll try to do better once I get out of here.
But you need to promise me one thing.
Show me your diary every day.
After school I went to the hospital to see Mom.
"Mom is hurt, so she has to stay there a few days."
Tomorrow I'll go to the hospital and show Mom my diary as I promised.
It's nice...
"Now Mom doesn't work late, she doesn't drink, and I can see her whenever I want."
I am happy that I could fulfil my promise.
I won't survive for long.
I might not live until your release from prison.
"But I pray that... ... you get back your son, Suraj."
From Ram Prasad Saxena.
You are my Moon.
You are my Sun... you are the apple of my eye
"The easterly brings hope, like the birds soaring in the sky"
"God willing, some day, you will fly with the clouds"
"And some day, I will be envied for having mothered you"
You are my Moon.
You are my Sun
It's ready.
Take it.
"What are you looking at, son?"
- Nothing.
I think that... you should come along with me.
I?
What will I do there?
This the happiest day of my life.
Won't you come along on this day?
Your mother and Renu will be accompanying you.
You will have to accompany me.
- I told you that I'm not coming.
All right.
If you don't come along I won't go either.
You shouldn't fuss.
I'm ready.
Let's go.
"- Renu, she is accompanying us."
It is your responsibility to get her ready.
I'm waiting in the hall below.
Who is Rajesh?
My best friend!
"My school and college""s friend!"
"No matter how much I praise his friendship, its less."
ls that so?
You have never mentioned Rajesh before.
How can I mention him?
He has joined the police force!
"And I am just working in the shipping company. seema, when you are in front of me, I forget everything."
"Now don""t talk too much."
And come with us for a picnic!
Picnic?
- Yes!
How can I come for the picnic?
He is coming after a long time.
"He will feel so dejected if he won""t find me here."
"Good luck, sir!"
Good luck!
"lt""s the sign of your promotion."
"This is the first time that this jeep""s tyre has got punctured."
Rao.
"- Yes, sir."
"Don""t talk nonsense."
"Take out the jack from the jeep. sorry, sir!"
There is no jack!
There is no jack!
"Take out the spanner. sorry, sir."
"We don""t have that too."
"Take out the screw driver. sir, we can take out the screw."
"But it""s difficult to take out the driver. otherwise who will drive?"
"Rao, I am fed up of this!"
"How does your jeep work? sir, it""s a police jeep. lt works on its reputation."
Okay what page am I on?
"Okay, oh okay."
Sorry.
"There, okay, ready, ready."
Okay.
"A, is the following."
Negative four on the diagonal .
"Ready, ready."
This is what makes it complicated.
Once.
An occasional zero.
"And then 1s, and then, an occasional zero."
Okay.
We'll get it though.
"By the way its the same over here, one's occasional zero's, zero's one down from here."
So this zero.
Is in that first M by M block.
Sorry.
No its not.
"It's, one over."
Sorry.
That zero.
"There's an N by N block there, and then a zero, and then 1s."
"Okay, so fourth, and this one here, zero is, one down here, ones, so I got three rows."
Six more to go.
"Alright then we have these, this is all due to periodic boundary conditions by the way."
Why these appear.
Then you have these 1s on the corners.
And then these ones over on this corners.
Got five diagonals.
"Then I have some ones over here that continue, there."
Then I have some ones.
"You don""t fear the public."
"You don""t fear your parents."
At least fear the police.
ls it a crime to love?
"Hey, lover boy!"
Why do you love openly?
Think about the people!
"What happened, constable Rao?"
You both too come here!
"What happened, constable?"
"Don""t ask!"
lf I had not come on time today then.. ..your image would have got tarnished!
This ruffian was going to kiss your daughter!
"What""s the harm in kissing?"
Young people should indulge in kissing!
- Yes! shut up!
lf my daughter starts giving free kisses.. ..then who will give me dowry?
"Look, Mr. Rao."
"lf you can give me 4000 gm gold, then you can stay! otherwise leave!"
"You don""t worry, papa! l will load you with gold!"
"Don""t trust this ruffian!"
"Look, if you want to get your daughter married.. ..then get her married to a decent, reputed, educated guy."
Even if he is of my age.
"This is something to ponder over! sorry, sir!"
I am one minute late.
1 minute late.
- Yes.
I got to know 1 minute prior. oh!
"Then it""s a great loss, sir!"
"ln this one minute, I could have.."
At this age?
"- Yes, sir!"
You crazy?
"Besides, the wardens will open and read it anyway."
Why wouldn't I?
Abla.
We're running out on detergent.
"Okay, dear."
Cemre...
Don't write silly things in the letter.
Remember the wardens will read it first.
"And don't write anything regarding the future, like so eager."
"- Just leave it to time, will you?"
- Okay mom...
It's Sami Amca.
We're gonna be late!
It can't be him at this hour.
Maybe it's the water guy.
Why would water guy come now?
What do you want?
- Good morning Zeynepciğim.
Come in?
"- No, thank you."
Sami Amca said you made some things for Kuzey.
I'll deliver it to him.
What do you mean you will deliver it to him?
- Are you going as well?
"- Are you, too?"
"No, I mean, they don't let him see people from out of the family."
Why do you go?
Sami Amca asked me.
So I must definitely go with him.
"And he went to the registry office to make application, with Aynur Abla."
"Oh, really?"
What has happened to my son?
I've often told you not to join the Air Force.
You are my only child.
By God's grace your life was saved today.
If anything happens in the future what will I do?
Wasn't I right?
"Mother, nothing has happened to me."
Go home and make offerings at the Lord's temple.
And this also won't happen again.
- Quiet!
You speak as though you know what will happen.
God bless you!
Who is she?
The doctor has forbidden me to speak in excess.
You tell her.
I am Renu.
My father is a retired jailer.
Oh!
So you are Renu!
He had written to me about you.
"But, whatever he had written was not sufficient."
Do you know what the doctor has said?
He said that unless we marry soon I won't get better.
Oh God!
I'll go and fix the wedding date right away.
"Yes, of course."
I have selfish motives.
Once you are married you won't risk your life so readily.
Touch mother's feet again on my behalf.
Touch my feet when you are my daughter-in-law.
Vandana!
You!
Once I've asked my senior here
You will be sorry.
"Miss Mu, under the circumstances earlier..."
"You had no choice, and needn't worry about your oath"
"I've sworn,"
I can't take my word back now.
"If you don't like me,"
"I will have to kill you, and then I'll kill myself."
Do you want to be my husband?
I'm willing to marry you.
"Good day, my master."
Good day.
Master?
What kind of a master are you?
"It took us a while to locate you,"
let's go back to the palace.
I was about to bring Miss Mu to meet my parents.
Go ahead and tell them first.
We've found our master.
What kind of a master are you?
Be patient.
"After we've reached the bottom of the hill, you'll know when you see my welcoming party."
Who are you?
"We had a deal earlier, remember?"
"After we've reached Dali city,"
I'll tell you the details.
Senior.
Where's Tuan Yu?
Senior.
"Tuan Yu has killed the Red Python, sucked up its blood, and has now acquired ""Red Dragon Soul"" style."
I was no match for him.
What?
Are you sure you want.......
Bad Horse!
Bad Horse!
Bad Horse!
Bad Horse!
He rides across the nation the thorough bread of sin.
He got the application that you just sent in.
It needs evaluation so let the games begin.
A heinous crime to show of course.
A murder would be nice of course.
Bad Horse!
Bad Horse!
Bad Horse!
He's bad!
The evil league of evil is watching so beware!
"The grade that you receive will be your last, we swear."
So make the Bad Horse prideful or he'll make you his mare.
"You saddled up, there's no recourse."
"It high ho silver, signed Bad Horse."
- I don't know.
- Are you kidding?
This is great!
I'm about to pull a major heist!
"You know, the Wonderflonium that I need for the freeze ray?"
It's being transported tomorrow!
Armored car?
Courrier van.
Candy for a baby.
Do you need anything dampened or made soggy?
Thanks but... the league is watching.
I gotta do this alone.
Will you lend a caring hand to shelter those who need it?
My poor daughter!
What am I doing?
"He wants to be the king, but what is he doing?"
You mean the one who's stopping the ship is Sir Moonlight Black Hat?
"Yes, he's the one who helped both of us."
He's so cool!
So that's why he couldn't reveal his identity to me!
"This is all secret, so please do not let on that you know."
I'll be on my way now.
Wait!
Take me to him!
I don't think just anyone can meet him.
"In that case, please deliver a message for me."
"She says she respects you, Sir Moonlight Black Hat."
"You told her to not do anything, right?"
"Yes, but she said she wants to meet you."
She can't.
It won't be good to be involved with me.
We can't meet.
I really want to meet him again.
He seems like such a cool person!
"If I knew it'll be like this,"
I should have asked me for a business card!
So such a man existed?
He must be a true Joseon hero!
He disguises himself in the moonlight and rescued civilians in need!
I wish I could be like that too.
Then why don't you disguise yourself and go out in the moonlight?
How could I do that?
Why not?
You're a warrior who knows how to fight.
He's Sir Moonlight Black Hat.
"- All right, all right!"
- Come on.
- What are you reading?
- Chekhov.
- Why?
- He's funny.
- You laugh too much.
Go read the Counsellor's Magazine.
Deal with your inexperience.
- And here's the Queen of the Fields!
"Maestro, music!"
"- Well, hello there Corn!"
- Did you win a cake at the factory?
- Yes I did.
- And a cake from the post office?
- Yes I did.
"- And you'll win a cake here, too."
- Indeed.
- We sure won't be giving a cake to some Puss-in-the-Boots.
"- Comrade Dynin, these days the legumes are mentioned a lot."
- Maybe the bean pod will be better?
- Then they would have done so at the factory.
Don't you worry.
- Same old costumes all year 'round.
So tired of seeing them!
"- Well, don't look at them, then!"
"- Seriously, why can't kids make their own costumes?"
"All you need is some construction paper and glue, that's all!"
- And our pride?
Are we so poor that we wrap kids in construction paper?
"Let's better pick who should be our ""queen of the fields!"""
- That's easy:
It's all a disgraceful lie.
She came into my office and tore off her clothes.
Who's to believe that?
I'm disappointed.
What you did was inadmissible.
I've worked here night and day for three years.
- I sacrificed my marriage.
- Your divorce changed you.
I was just congratulated on our sales.
Which you owe to colleagues like Ms Limmer.
Don't you get it?
Ms Limmer wants my job.
"You're paranoid, Mr Fuchs."
Now what?
The consequences are quite clear.
You want to fire me?
I'll take you to court.
I know of similar cases.
You don't stand a chance.
Who do you think you are?
I won't stand for this!
Leave my office at once.
What if he goes to court?
He'd be in more trouble.
"Brigitte, don't forget you stand to profit too."
Ms Limmer.
- Are you feeling better?
"- Yes, I'm all right."
"If you need anything, you can call me any time."
That's very kind.
Thank you.
I don't think Rex has earned his ham roll today.
The view is great.
When I earn a lot of money
It'd be nice to visit with family.
"There's a pool, a gym with treadmill, a spa,"
"A great view, and so many rooms."
Haven't you all been to places like this?
When I travel with family or with friends
I've been to places like these so I'm quite used to it.
How many rooms are there?
I'm used to this.
"Please be quiet, curly head."
What is Zelo's concept today?
How awesome.
"Zelo's concept is a Chopin, Mozart, Beethoven kind of feel."
The prime of music!
Not Rome...
"Zelo is to be a composer from Vienna, Austria."
He can't hear.
"He can't hear, but he's writing out what's in his head."
I don't think he can play the piano.
Why are you filming my feet?
I'm embarrassed...
Dae Hyun has sexy feet.
He's a man with sexy feet.
My feet turned ugly from dancing.
I have calluses.
- That's what's pretty.
- The trace of life!
It's beautiful.
My feet have gotten dauntless.
Zelo has flat fleet.
- I don't have flat feet.
"If you do, I'm going to shoot you."
This is great.
-Look at that.
"-Oh, that's a legion of elephants."
I'm going to enjoy a real safari after not having one for a long time!
Huh?
Are you guys really going to shoot real elephants?
There was a passage behind the waterfall.
We can just say that we thought this place was also a part of the park.
Atom!
Don't cut in.
This is the place for perfect aim.
Pura!
Zora.
Good!
Zora!
I'm going to fight you!
"Here, Pura."
Now it's time to say goodbye.
Go ahead.
You can be happiest when you are with your kind.
I had no idea there was this kind of natural passage behind the waterfall.
I should have investigated it more thoroughly.
"I just didn't know about this passage, but Pura's mom was..."
She's beyond recovery now because of Zora.
"No, it's all good now, Doctor Hura."
"Ah, that's right!"
Let's build an ocean safari next time.
It will be a great item!
Cannibal whale this time?
Don't invite me.
Atom!
"Welcome, sir."
You can go to bed.
I will attend to my guest myself.
"Of course, sir."
Good night.
"Wow, this place is super."
You like it?
I can't believe it.
Cemre must be stupid to leave this place.
"Yeah, and she left for another stupid person."
She turned her back on me because of stupid Kuzey.
"""My daughter, Cemre..."""
"""... if you are reading this letter..."""
"""... that means I gave my last breath."""
"""And that I left this world with a great guilt of conscience."""
"""Last time we spoke you said you didn't want to see me again."""
"""You were rightfully angry at me."""
"""I didn't have much to say back then."
"As don't have now either."""
"""After all those years, I know it is too late to--"""
"Okay, I'll read it later."
Thank you for coming here.
- It was my job.
- You did your job successfully.
Kazım Bey...
"I don't know what he told you and in what degree, but... ..."
I have never asked anything from him... ... for neither myself nor my daughter.
- I know.
- As I told him back then as well... ...
I wanted to Cemre for myself.
And that's the best thing I've ever done.
"No money, nothing could match it."
"If I'm to know my boundaries again, I need to have a last time."
I'm not a fool.
I'll go back behind my boundaries after that.
"Young Master, why are you following me?"
I'm not following you.
I'm just walking.
But Yongmun is all the way over there!
I don't want to go there right now.
Have you run away?
Or are you in trouble with Madam Noh?
"Well, you're higher up than her, so I guess you won't get in trouble."
Did you have an argument with her?
Madam Noh cannot argue with me.
"You know, I was always curious, but how come you're higher than Madam Noh?"
You're younger and don't do much.
Why do you order her around like that?
What is the relationship between you and Madam Noh?
Madam Noh is like a mother to me.
"Who are you anyway, Young Master?"
I've known you for over a year.
But I don't know what you do.
I don't even know your name.
"Like you said, I've run away."
But I have nowhere to go.
"I don't do much, so I won't be missed."
Why don't you teach me how I should spend the day?
"If so, I'll tell you my name."
"First, my surname is Yi."
Young Master Yi?
I'm hungry.
Shall we go eat something?
"Great idea, Young Master Yi!"
You will die in my hands!
But I swore I wouldn't get involved with you again.
"I said leave me, leave!"
I don't use any opportunity .
I don't look at anyone's wife or girl either.
Put this in your goofball head.
Did you get me man?
EPlSODE 5 - Leave me !
What can you do man alone?
"Come on, do it!"
"Mira is my friend and whenever I want to be with her, i will be ."
Got it?
Now get out!
Don't dare to come here again!
What's going on here?
Nothing...
"I came to thank him for helping in the club, but... alas..."
I forgot that we don't talk the same language with our friend.
"It'm not at fault, but I'm sorry for disturbing you.Good night."
What did we talk with you Yaman?
This man came to my door.
What's his trouble with you?
"It's okay, nothing."
"- If you're right you will tell what happened, why do you keep quiet?"
We've solved it already .
There is nothing to tell.
"Come on Ender, anyway we have more important things to do, let's go and talk with Faruk."
Come dear...
Subtitles brought to you by Ebb and Tide Team @ Viki
Thank you.
"What is it ,dear Ender?"
"As soon as you heard ,did you also come to ask for your money?"
These people will be like this only.
What a big house this is?!
You have seen only the outside.
Now see the inside.
It will be great.
What is this?
"I am afraid of dogs, sir."
Thieves must be afraid of dogs.
Why should you be?
That is why I am afraid.
He is counting notes by the heap.
The boss is coming.
"Boss, this mans name is Kona Ranga Rao."
A good friend of mine.
He came to seek your help.
Dont be afraid.
A blood relation started between us.
Ask him.
"Sir, I tried various businesses in different parts of the state."
I also tried different precious stones.
"When I was that my fate would never change, I met you."
Ask him a loan.
"Sir, I need some financial assistance from you."
Uncle!
The God has granted the wish but the priest created hurdles.
Take this.
"Sir, you helped me as soon as I asked."
If you please visit my home for dinner.. ..
I will repay your kindness.
"Hey, why will he come to your house?"
Stay within your limits.
"Uncle, he made the request himself."
Really?
Then why did.. - Marry you?
"Yes, tell me, why did you marry me?"
Don't keep taunting me.
Anyone can commit mistake.
"Yes, just like your parents did."
You.
- Mala mind your tongue.
Or else.. - Or else?
- Or else.
- Yes.
Or else.
- Or else what?
"Hey, get back to work all of you."
Get to work.
"Bhikhu, you do your work as well."
Should I do all the work?
I can't even fire him.
People get motorcycle in dowry but what did I get?
This servant.
Who can't even dream of doing any work!
Be thankful that you at least got him.
Stop it
What is this?
It took you 20 years to realize your dream.
To turn your hotel into Bollywood Caf.
For this?
So that you can utilize every nook and corner of this place to argue.
"For god sake, your staff laughs at you"
"'God, please show me a way to stop mom and dad's arguments forever.'"
"Why did you bring me here, Tanya?"
So that you can explain to my grandpa.. ..why you're allergic to marriage.
Please welcome the first lady of the United States of America - Michelle Obama.
[song: ladies night]
[cheering applause]
"..how are you? ah, well welcome"
I'm so happy to see you again.
"And you still, you still moving."
"I'm trying to, trying to move."
"You're moving it, you're doing it."
You still got the moves.
It's all about movement.
Let's move.
"We're trying to get people up and dancing, dancing is a great way to lose a little weight, be healthy be healthy, be happy."
You are demonstrating it every day.
"I, I try to promote it every day."
I like to move.
"It doesn't matter how well you move, it's just moving."
You're good though.
"You're, you're a good mover."
"But, still I, I think maybe still better than your husband."
I hate to say it.
"I, I'm sure of that."
[laughing]
Yeah.
He tried to dispute it when he was here.
He's rural.
"Yeah, yeah."
[laughing]yeah.
I think we have proof.
Yeah
We do have proof.
"No, you're definitely a better mover."
"Ahm, well"
"Because well, it's very important!"
Come on...
We're going to Ankara.
"- Perihan, you get prepared, too."
- I'm not coming.
- What do you mean you're not coming?
We should be there as a family.
- I am not coming!
"I can't lie, looking in their eyes."
You go.
What are you waiting for!
Go!
And you go find out if it's that journalist who put it on the Internet.
"Go, we're doing all this for you."
It's all in vain...
It's too late.
Everyone will know it by tomorrow.
I don't know how we'll recover from this.
Make a call and sort out the tickets.
So that we depart as soon as we get to the airport.
And tell Perihan not to talk to them.
"If they know we're going, they might refuse us."
"""It's on the news and Internet... ... we've got to talk!"""
They are gone.
They ran away.
"""Münir Telci Law Office."
We can't answer your call right now.
"Please leave your message after the tone."""
"God damn you, Münir Telci."
This is ridiculous.
Throw dirt and hope it sticks.
"You've been doing that to the Yaşarans for years, I know."
I am very happy.
I have invested 14 crores in the movie.
If you had not brought her I would have been doomed.
Take these 10 lakhs.
I dont need 10 lakhs.
Only three lakhs is enough.
"Oh, you do not seem to belong to this age."
He is saying no to money.
I need to send this money urgently to Vizag.
Can you make any arrangements please?
When he is requesting us why do you stare with an open mouth?
Move now.
I will have it done.
Are you looking for Venkat?
- He is upstairs.
He is taking money from the producer for bringing you back.
He must have taken five or 10.. lakhs not thousands.
This is true.
I swear by my mother.
Dont try to cheat me anymore father.
You told me that he threw the ring down.. ..and I stayed away from him believing you.
Now you are telling me that he took money.
Even if he took money they would be the strong reason for it.
I will believe only Venkat and not you.
Why are you backing him?
Do you know how much trouble I took to make you.. ..a heroine?
Will you now go away with him?
What will happen to the movie?
Come with me.
Wait.
Leave her.
I left her.
"What am I gonna do, huh ?"
Broadcast her over the lnternet ?
- Yeah.
- You can do that ?
[ Scoffs ]
No.
I cannot do that to her.
"Jim, get some fuckin' balls."
"If you don't have the guts to photograph a naked chick, how you gonna sleep with one ?"
"I don't like the kid, but he's got a point."
"See, even shit-brick knows you should do it."
All you gotta do is set up some sort of private link or whatever on the 'Net... and tell me the address.
You can send me the address too.
I'll save you a seat.

"Okay, that was good, but I want to thicken-up that solo."
"Michigan State is this Saturday, and I want that part to smoke."
"Yeah, I know, my timing's off."
"No, it's not that."
I think it'll work better as a duet with a tenor part.
I'll do it.
- [ Whispers ]
Dick.
- I'll do it.
Great.
See you tomorrow.
Hmph.
- Why are you doing this ?
Please leave this place.
Shailu is mine.
Bhadranna!?
I can die ten times for Shailu.
Can you die once?
"I am ready, what about you?...Are you ready?"
"Uncle, why are you supporting him?"
I called you from vizag to convince him not to support him.
Why are you being hasty?
I will talk to him.
Why do you interact with that rowdy?
What is the necessity that you want the girl he loves?
He wants the girl I love.
Have you seen how arrogantly he is speaking?
Do one thing.
Leave this city and come to Vizag with me.
I will not come.
Dont talk like that.
Why do you want to stay here.. ..and have a dispute with that rowdy.
Why do you try to scare me?
What if he is a rowdy?
What is his specialty?
I am also a rowdy.. .. if anyone tries to interferes in my matter.
Beat me.
I kicked my mother when I was a kid.
She never beat me.
I kicked my father when I have grown up.
He never beat me.
You shouldnt have leaved him brother.
You must have killed him there itself.
What is the need for that?
He only announced that.. ..he can die ten times for her.
"Not to mention, your Jedi friends caused an unspeakable amount of damage!"

"What's the matter, old buddy?"
You face is crustier than a patch of wookie butt fur!
Gross!
"Whoah, you look terrible"
"Maybe you need a Viagra prescription... ...to turn on your lightsaber, you know what I mean?"
This kid doesn't.
"Seriously though, are you losing your edge or what?"
You're absorbing more abuse than a hutt tampon!
(sorry)
The Qui Gon I knew would have been kicking my teeth in right now.
"Hey, I'm just kidding, it's all in good fun."
Put 'er there!
(laughs)
"Alright now get out of here, you old creep."
Why don't you take this kid with you?
I know you're into that.
"Seriously though, kid, watch out for that guy."
He uh... he has a past.
Look at him.
Such a... bumbling creature.
So foolish.
He's made of so much skin.
I will make him part of us.
Yes!
I will wear his face!
Look how much the others hate him!
Almost as if they wish he was gone.
"And only after that call themselves lndian! very good, dear!"
I am glad to see your patriotism!
Ms. seema.. your patriotism has cast a spell on me. can I expect to have one more meeting with you?
"lf it won""t happen, then it will be my bad luck."
"You have come so close, that staying apart is out of the question."
Thanks a lot.
"Mr. Diwan, give me the permission to leave."
"Thank you so much for coming, Mr. Rajesh."
Thank you very much for the nice food.
Yes!
"- Hello! sP Rajesh please! sorry, sir! sP sir is not here!"
There is a gift for him.
You can take it. keep a close watch on all the trucks.. ..passing through Dharampar road.
"What""s your name?"
- A patriot!
Hello!
Today I have nabbed you!
"- What happened, constable?"
You will find out soon! search the truck! okay! - come on!
Why is this truck empty?
"lt""s not a crime to drive empty truck, constable!"
"lt""s a crime!"
This truck is used to deliver goods.
"And it""s a crime to drive empty truck."
"Henceforth I shouldn""t see it empty!"
Got it?
"Let""s go!"
"When I signaled you to stop, why didn""t you stop?"
I am sorry.
"I didn""t see the signal. okay!"
We will find out soon! constables! search the truck and frisk them! sure! sure!

Don't I look funny?
Funny!
Funny!
"This one must have married this one, and given birth to this one!"
Look at how plump they are!
The police has to know I'm alright so that they'll stop chasing him.
- Who are you?
- Your father has asked us to find you.
The Councilor will soon be here to fetch you.
Tell the police to stop chasing the thieves as I am alright.
You were kidnapped by the thugs that attacked the police.
Are you sure you're alright?
Don't you understand that my father wanted you to find me before the police so that there would be no rumors spread?
"If you tell Eun Hye that I know about Hong Gil Dong, you will not go unpunished!"
Eun Hye!
- Father!
- Are you alright?
- I'm alright.
Where would I go?
And what would I pack?
"Oh, it's going to take me forever to do all of that packing."
What are you supposed to pack when you go to exile?
Are you supposed to pack warm?
Opal?
"Opal, how did you get up there?"
"Hang on, you poor dear!"
Mama's coming!
Rainbow Dash?!
How dare you strand my poor Opal on the tree.
"Well, how else were we gonna get you out here to show you... ...this!"
What is it?
It's not...
You...
We all finished your dress for you.
Thanks to Fluttershy's freaky knowledge of sewing.
Do you like it?
Like it?
Like it?!
Uh-uh.
She doesn't like it.
"No, I don't like it."
I LOVE IT!
You ponies did an amazing job.
It's exactly the way I imagined it.
We just followed your brilliant design.
Like we should have let you do for our outfits.
Those first dressed you designed were perfect.
We're so super sorry.
You worked really hard to make our dresses exactly the way we wanted them.
We all saw how well that turned out.
- My childhood spent with it's tunes.
My father used to play these tunes.
You know what?
I'll miss you all a lot.
Really?
- Yes
And listen!
"Do come to my house once, okay?"
My father is a very nice man.
You know what?
"In my childhood, he used to make me cry a lot."
"He used to say, I'll get you married with a police officer."
I never like the police officers.
What will you say them now?
Now?
"Now, I'll say... fine..."
I like one police officer only if he stops smoking.
Smoking?
- Yes.
You...
Really?
Really?
What if I wasn't a police officer?
Still...
But before encountering them it's very important... ...to bring out Radha safe from their clutches.
"But the problem is that if police will arrest them... ...or attack them, they'll shoot Radha."
Or they'll point gun at Radha for their escape.
"I think so, sir."
"Sir, I've got one idea."
What if we go to them in the disguise of goons... ...and attack them?
- Yes.
In that case they'll escape safely with Radha.

"Something new, you know."
I'm sure we can manage!

Here we throw the balls.
Here we toss the rings.
And here... we bob for apples.

I will burn myself into ashes.
Will you keep it aside if I tell you?
Have you not told me to do so?
- Let us go out.
It seems son-in-law is going to do something.
Let us not disturb him.
Come on.

"- Hey you, come here."
"Sir, Bhadram sir!"
You are my God.
Please save my daughter and me.
She is my only daughter and I brought her up as a doll.
Even my master is also looking her as a doll.. ..but he wants to see her in his home.
He is ready to give 10 lakhs if you accept this marriage.
When crores are coming who needs lakhs.
"I will first use him to finish Venkat, then think this matter."
"My God, 10 lakhs?"
Where are they?
"Here, take them."
"Sir, God has given me an extra tooth but not extra intelligence."
I would have realized your heart if He gave me that.
But I am unfortunate.
This marriage will not happen.
Why is that?
"Every idiot wants to marry my daughter.. ..Sir, I am not talking about him."
"He is pure gold, I am talking about that fellow.. ..who trapped my daughter in the name of love."
Who are you?
Why are you standing there and blocking the entrance?
Please come in sir.
Please have this seat sir.
"This is the house of a poor man, built with a lot of effort."

He has a very big heart.
He is the king of Telangana.
He does not go to anyones home.
He visited only ours.
"She is Shailaja, my daughter."
"Will you get some coffee, my dear?"
She is learning dance.
He brought that rowdy with him.
One scoundrel joined another.
You leave quickly.
What about the coffee?
I will take care of all that.
You leave now.
Otherwise you may not meet that guy.
Why did the young girl become an old woman?
"Sir, coffee!"
Please take it.
She is my mother in law.
But she is more than my mother.
Then why do you make her serve the coffee?
You should have asked your child to do it.
She went to the temple for her prayer.
She should have gone after an hour.
After an hour the priests will close the temple and leave.
My child has a lot of devotion for God.
There is a temple on the side and that side too.
"You go on, call him."
Take this over.
- What's up?- It is declared.

I put my initials on it as well as our team B.A.P.
"To the left, you see this side and to the right, that side."
Walk like this.
Then B.A.P will show.
"So for the left shoe, I drew on the outer side."
"And for the right shoe, I drew on the inner side."
And on the back is our Matoki.

"""Children shouldn't lie."""
"""No matter what, they shouldn't lie,"" she said."
"""They shouldn't lie, even if their mothers wants them to,"" she said."
"You are lying to me as well, now."
I know what you said isn't written here.
"- It is written here son.- The Baby Rabbit's story is different, I know it."
"Oh, this is the other *baby rabbit*'s story though."
Which is much better if you ask me.I think it is very good.
Children shouldn't lie.
They should never lie.
You don't lie to me either.Okay son?
Okay then.
Let us sleep now.I'm sleepy.
"Daddy, fireworks were so beautiful, aren't they?"
"They were beautiful, son.Very beautiful."

Good night.
I dont think so.
It is raining since this is the rainy season.
I remember from the rain.
I will show you a beautiful place.
Come
Where to?
To the temple of thousand pillars.
It will be wonderful experience to see it when it is raining.
With two temples on either side of nandi .. ..and a rainbow starting from one temple ends on the other.
You have to see it definitely.
Really?
Will it be so nice?
You should see yourself to believe.
Come on let us go.
- Now?
It can be seen only when it is raining.
Believe me.
Please come once.
It stopped to rain.
Bye.
Where are you going?
Should I tell you?
At least tell me when will we meet again.
Let us see when it again rains.
What is that?
Didnt you tell that the rain is uniting us?
If we meet when it again rains.. ..I will also believe that there is something between us.
Bye.
You will meet again when it rains?
I dont understand a bit.
Do you at least know his name?
"What is there in the name, Grandmother?"
My Goodness!- I heard that uncle Hasan is afraid of Turunc Nadir.
I made Giray tell him as if Kenan said that he has to take his complaint back or...
Turunc Nadir will get to know about it..
You really don't know?
Did you wake up?
Come.
I didn't know you were home.
"We work at night girl, I wake up only now."
"While you sleep, probably nothing will be left to the bazaar."
I am waiting for you many hours already..
Wait I will wash my face and we will go.
I will leave as you will go to bazaar.
"I am sorry.- No dear, that takes the cake!"
I will come again.
Goodbye!
Say hello to your mom!
-Yes of course!
It means I was deceived but this**** girl and I didn't know.
The account for this will be asked.
"Here you are,- Thank you!"
Have a nice day! &amp;gt; Good day!
"I'm alright, I'm good, sweetie, don't worry."
"Okay , we'll talk later."
"Okay, my dearest, kisses for you too."
Bye - bye!

Yes.

Now you'll know how my son is.
Oh.. no.
He and my dad.. so this is how he is.
You threw a balloon at my father.
"My delicate, innocent and.."
Stop praising me.
And give them a reply.
- Ok.
What was that?
Is that your fitting reply?

- Did you meet him?
So you do know him!
Don't you know who he is?
"He said he couldn't reveal his identity, so I didn't see his face."
Did you see it?
Do you know who he is?
He hid his identity from me.
It is not up to me to reveal it.
But I still want to see his face.
"I'm really good-looking, aren't I?"
You shouldn't look at me too often.
You'll only spoil yourself for other men.
I wasn't looking at you.
So you know how to be shy too?
What was that?
Why do you carry such a dirty thing with you?
It's a pouch.
That thing?
It's embroidered too!

Is there no way to find her without causing too much commotion?
I have bad news.
Suraj's plane hasn't returned as yet.
There's still no news about him.
- No!
Please don't worry.
The search is on.
His companions did not see his plane crash.
We believe that he is still alive.
- Then why hasn't he returned?
He must have fallen in the hands of the enemy.
We cannot be sure at this stage.
- No!
What is the matter?
Was it news about Suraj?
His plane is lost.
"What will happen now, daddy?"
Suraj's plane is lost.
"I hope, nothing has happened to him."
"No, don't say that."
Suraj is alive.
My blessings will save him from every peril.
"Don't cry, my child."
I believe that he will return soon.
He has told me that he will return and eat what I have cooked.
You took away my husband.
I didn't say a word.
You took away my father and I didn't say a word.
You were unjust to me at every stage.
I never complained.
But...
If anything happens to my son I will believe that you are not God.
That you are not the protector of the universe.
The deal is done!
Wow!
Nice deal!
I will make the remaining arrangement!
Now you all can leave!

"This is betrayal! kaka sir, we might be smugglers!"
"But that doesn""t mean that we put our country at stake!"
We ruin our country!
"And sell our motherland! kaka sir, can we sell our motherland?"
They will even sell garden and air.
They will even sell garden and air.
lf they had their way they will sell God.
"We're gonna be late.- Be a good boy in there, okay?"
Are you really okay?
"You look very pale, my child.Come, take my arm."
"- Are you here, jerk?- Kerim what are you doing."
Collect yourself.
I will make you pay for everything you did.
"- Come on, Kerim."
What are you doing?- He can't stare at us from there.
"- Abi, it's okay."
"Not here.- Come on, walk inside Kerim."
- He lost it again.
"Take him inside.- Okay, leave it to me."
"- Fatmagül...- We're come, we're coming."
"It's your turn Fatmagül, okay?Don't let them scare you."
"Be brave, stand straight."
You will be victorious.We will be.
My knees are shaking.
My whole body feels stiff.
I've waited for this day for months.
I've waited patiently.
It's time for revenge.
It's time to stand against thosewho tried to take my life away.
Why are you looking at me with hatred?
Why?
Because I didn't yield to you?
Because I didn't loose against youand I didn't accept the life you forced upon me?
You expect me to hang my head in shame as I walk before you.
I'm not the one who should be ashamedand you know that well.
Hence the hate in your eyes.
You wanted to clean your dirty consciences by staining me.
Even giving up your honors for it.
"*""We won't hurt you."
Say something.
Please.
I shouldn't have kidnapped you.
"The car, the bridge, it was too far."
Thank you.
But you shouldn't have lied to me today.
"You can't go off and do things like that, Elena."
Not while Klaus is still alive.
I know.
I just...I wanted to give Bonnie a moment with her mother without everything else getting in the way.
Without me getting in the way.
I didn't plan on kissing him.
"You're better than him, Elena."
You're better than both of us.
Elena's on her way.
Jamie's safe.
"He's a little bruised, but he's safe."
Do you think the hybrid will come back?
You kept your end of the bargain.
Klaus usually keeps his.
You're willing to do all of this for him...
And he's not even your family.
"He is my family, Bonnie."
"I know that might be hard for you to hear, but he is."
But that doesn't mean that I don't care about you.
I want to help you.
You can't.
You have no magic and I don't trust you.
"When I put mikael down, my magic didn't just leave me."
It drifted away.
"The longer I stayed away from you, the weaker it got."
I think nature was punishing me for abandoning you.
"Anyway, I don't want to focus too much on that."
You can play around with that if you like.
Minus this whole thing evaluated at 0.
So what's e to the minus 0?
"Well, e to the minus 0 is 1."
Right?
That's e to the 0.
"We have a minus 1, so it becomes plus 1 times-- now, sine of 0 is 0."
"Minus 1 over s squared, cosine of 0."
Let's see.
"Cosine of 0 is 1, so we have minus 1 over s squared, minus 1 over s squared, times 1."
So that is equal to minus 1 over s squared.
"And I think I made a mistake, because I shouldn't be having a negative number here."
So let's backtrack.
Maybe this isn't a negative number?
"Let's see, infinity, right?"
This whole thing is 0.
"When when you put 0 here, this becomes a minus 1."
Yeah.
So either this is a plus or this is a plus.
"Let's see where I made my mistake. e to the minus st-- oh, I see where my mistake is."
Right up here.
"Where I factored out a minus e to the minus st, right?"
Fair enough.
"So that makes this 1 over s, sine of at."
"But if I factor out a minus e to the minus st, this becomes a plus, right?"
"It was a minus here, but I'm factoring out of a minus e to the minus st."
So that's a plus.
This is a plus.
"Boy, I'm glad that was not too difficult to find."
So then this becomes a plus.
And then this becomes a plus.
They all look like superstitious rubes.
They've got no credibility.
Thomas will rip them to pieces.
"You'll be worse off than you are now, if that's possible."
You're gonna replace me on this case.
You've screwed it up beyond all repair.
But the archdiocese feels that replacing you now... ...would only draw more unnecessary attention to the trial.
"But just so we're clear, Bruner... ...if you put that priest on the stand again, I will fire you."
You've been crying.
- Dr. Cartwright is dead.
- What?
He was killed.
There was an accident.
I'm sorry.
I know he was your friend.
We've lost.
"Without his testimony, it's over."
No.
"No, no, no, it isn't over."
We're telling Emily's story.
That's what matters.
- It can't be worth all this.
"- Yes, it is worth it."
Just let me go back on the stand and tell the rest of the story.
- I can't do that.
- You must!
You must.
"Erin, you once said that you felt you were on the right path."
Don't stray from that path.
"Here, take this."
- What is this?
- Just read it.
The girl made this up because she was scared of you.
"She went away with Kerim, willingly."
And that's all there is to it.
This is a terrible ruse!
It's a disgusting frame set up by my rivals there.
Then do whatever necessary to clean up this mess.
- What's in the news?
It says Selim did it?
"- They're fabricated news, dear."
- Who's the girl?
- Will you calm down please?
Do whatever's needed to clean it up.
If my family's name gets involved in such a scandal... ...
"I will burn the bridges, just so you know."
"Meltem, calm down sweetie."
Let's first understand what it is.
Then do what needs to be done.
Don't waste time.
"I'll be on it right away, don't worry."
God...
My hands and legs are shaking.
God damn whoever is responsible for this slander.
- I'll be waiting for your call.
- I'll call you right away.
"We're toast now, Perihan."
We're toast.
God damn it!
"Girl, look..."
It's on the local news only.
It's most likely a slander.
That's what the man said.
For God's sake...
"That would work, as well."
Doctor?
How is Mustafa Bulut?
"He isn't very well, right now."
"But, it is still early."
- He will get better.
- How can he get better?
"Is the technology to make him well discovered in this world, yet?"
"For me, I think he has found the perfect place for himself!"
They should leave him alone.
"Really, it was because of you, Doctor!"
"Thanks, to you!"
"Really, thanks!"
You don't know what it is to live under those conditions.
We wanted him to go there for treatment.
"So, that he gets better and gets out."
We have no other agenda.
"Okay, my dear... drink this.."
Isn't it a hospital?
He is there to get well.
Your husband is going to get better and come home.
You can't carry on like this.
"But, Mom, what can I do?"
"How can I bear this, Mom?"
"Go to sleep, my daughter."
"Come, sleep."
Pray to God.. it will give you strength.
"Hey, Naciye... look for second.."
"Don't mess with me, Safiye..."
I will tear your hair out!
"You crazy idiot, aren't we from the same village?"
"I just called over to have you drink a soda, relax, tell me your trouble... come.."
"Really, you made me so happy by coming here."
I was so touched that day...
"I couldn't stop the car, you couldn't talk with Yaman..."
"Enough to know that he is fine, I will come from time to time to see him even if it's from distance."
It's okay even if I don't talk.
It's enough for me to know that he is happy.
What's up?
Fine! &amp;gt; It's been a while we have met.
Do we use to meet in the past?
What's happening to you?
Let me know if we are on outs.
"No... far from it, why should be on outs.. for being on outs... there has to be a communication... right?"
What? &amp;gt; All the best with your studies!
See you!
Rudeness...
"He has grown in the mud but ,my kid didn't become dirty."
Don't let him become dirty!
Keep it if you want.
Really?
- Take !. there are more in the photo album.
Do you love Yaman?
"Yes...I mean like a friend,i love him.."
I have a boyfriend.
We are together for a long time.
Do you love him then?
"In fact if you look, it's very stupid to think of something like sitting here... but Orkun was always in my life, from my childhood."
We grew up in the same aquarium.
"I don't know if it's really love, habit or we got used to each other..."
We get on well.
"I mean Orkun is very nice, cheerful, ..."
Funny.. -Yaman is funny too...
"Yes, Yaman Is very different of course..."
"I wrecked my familyfor nothing, absolutely nothing."
I don't have the face to say anything.
But what happened has happened.
I did it again.
Forgive me.
Forgive me and go.
As if you left me anywhere to go.
Who would accept me now?
Who would forgive me?
"If you spoil those men's game...Maybe, your husband will get soften."
Go girl...
I'll buy your plane ticket.I'll put some money in your pocket as well.
Go and testify.Be their doom !
"Offf, days and weeks have passed here."
But these minutes feel even longer.I'll loose my mind.
- What if we come back here.- Stop being a merchant of doom.
We'll end up here againif you keep attitude.
Stop it!
"- What's wrong, man?- Don't touch me!"
- He is just shaving you.- I don't want him to.
Fuck off then.
- I'm not dying to touch your face.- Ibrahim...
- If it wasn't for the orders I was given...- Just do your job.
Sit down.
Don't piss him off.
"- Sit down!- Come on, man."
We need a shave as well.
I feel dizzy.Must be because of high blood pressure.
"- Perihan, please get a grip on yourself.- Can we find some water?"
My mouth is also dry.
I told you not to come hereand go directly to the courthouse.
I will be the only one to see them anyway.
I am sure of that.
I can tell that Kazım Bey wants to do something for her... ... we appreciate it but.
We don't want it.
I think you shouldn't make your decision now.
Think of it as your father's last wish.
No.
We thank you but.
I can't accept that either.
Because he's never been my father.
"I just named this big void in my life ""father""."
I will never forgive him because he didn't try to fill this void.
I'll never forgive him for trying to ease his conscience with a piece of paper.
But I will not wish him ill.
So he doesn't need to worry.
- I can understand your anger.
- No you can't.
"This is not anger, mom."
"It's not hatred, disappointment or anything."
"- I know, sweetheart."
"- I mean, I never had a father."
And there never will.
Please you close this subject not to be opened again.
The decision is yours.
I feel much lighter now.
I won't have to lie to anybody anymore.
I can say my father really died.
My dear child.
Did I wake you up?
"No, I gotta go anyway."
"Oh, why?"
I thought we'd have breakfast together.
"No, I'll go to work."
What's her damage?
No damage.
"Come on, Ric, it's a fact of life."
"A girl that hot, that smart...Damage."
"Well, you know, I'm looking for red flags."
"Her, uh, her ex called her a psycho case the other day."
"Yeah, but if it comes from her ex, it doesn't count."
I guess you're right.
It's yours.
I wonder what my exes would call me.
Nothing.
They're all dead.
Hmm.
"Well, her ex is the medical examiner, so he's dead-adjacent."
She dated the medical examiner?
Mm-hmm.
"Well, I don't think he's dead-adjacent."
I think he's just dead.
What?
Murdered.
Sheriff's trying to keep a lid on it because he was staked in the chest like a vampire.
"Well, Meredith didn't say anything about that."
"Well, red flag number two."
Who do you think killed him?
I don't know.
"But if I was a cop, your sexy doctor lady friend would definitely be a suspect."
"What are you doing here, Klaus?"
Enjoying our stalemate.
What do you want?
"Question is, what do you want?"
"My hybrids left town as you demanded, so please tell me what I need to do to get my family back."
"Well, ahem, see, Klaus..."
I will arrange a job for him.
Ask him will he do it?
Look here my child.
I care a lot for you.
All I want is you should never repent like your mother.. ..that you have married a guy who is useless like me.
Take this flower.
Girls should put it in the plait.
Boys must put it in the ear.
Give this flower to Venkat.
Take the plate.
By the way will our son-in-law agree?
How can I say that?
I know.
He will not accept.
Your father will arrange a job for me?
Will he make me a card distributor in that club?
"Venkat, be serious."
My dad want you to join.. ..as assistant manager in a cement factory.
I dont want that.
Why?
Because my father arranged it.
- Yes.
How will you feed me if you dont have any job?
Anyone can ask that to me but not you.
When you believed that rain has united us.. ..then why cant you believe that I can feed you.
How will you do that?
- I will rob a bank or I will steal.
I can do anything for my love.
Try to understand me.
You want to see me as an employee.
With in 24 hours I will come to your house as an employee.
You have tried to create a dispute between your daughter ..and me because I am unemployed.
Good catch.
"Alright, alright."
So now let's shift some stuff.
"Shift happens, you guys just deal with it."
"So here we go, shift to everybody."
Let's shift.
We're going to we're going to shift E2.
Ready?
We're going to make it back to E3.
I don't have enough time to do it.
Here's how it's going to work.
And let's just see if you.
Are chill with this?
"I grab the first one and -one components of u two and I should make it second to n com, second to n components."
Sorry.
That should be.
"So I take the first one through n minus one of e two and make it the second n component here, and then finish this off I take the last component of e two and make it."
The first component.
Of E3.
And I'm going to drop E3.
Right here and this is at one.
Go.
There it is.
"See that I just took this, shifted it up, dropped it down."
"Alright let's finish this off, let me take this row here, this E4 and I am going to shift it down one over here and I do this the following way."
"I say I'm going to make the vector E5 and the way this is worth the same way, two and one is equal to E4."
"And, the first component is the last component."
And I put this E5 right.
"Right over here no p5, p5, and this is at, minus then plus, plus one."
And if I spy that.
There it is.
This is the matrix we built in class.

Europa (moon)

Europa is a large moon of the planet Jupiter. It is a little smaller than Earth's Moon and it is the sixth-largest moon in the solar system.
"Europa's diameter is about 3000 kilometers. It probably has an iron core, and an atmosphere that's mostly oxygen. The surface is icy and very smooth. There are not a lot of craters, but there are some cracks and lines. Because the surface is so young and smooth, scientists believe that there is a liquid ocean under the surface, and that it is kept warm by tidal heating. In other words, Jupiter's strong gravitational pull on Europa makes it warm."
The moon Europa was found by Simon Marius in December 1609. Galileo Galilei first saw the moon in January 1610 (he did not know Marius had found it). Simon Marius was the one who had the idea of the name 'Europa'.
"The moon Europa is named after a princess from Greek mythology who became the first queen of Crete. However, people usually called Europa 'Jupiter II' until the middle of the 20th century."

Four years later, in 999, the Holy Roman Emperor Otto III gave this district to his sister Adelheid, who was an abbess in Quedlinburg."
"In the center of this area, the ""provincia Gera"", a town with the same name was established. Another document, which is from the year 1237, said for the first time that there was a town called Gera. In this town, the abbesses of Quedlinburg had some officials which were called the ""Vögte"" of Gera. These officials were the ancestors of the counts and princes of Reuß, which reigned in Gera for many years, until the year 1918."

"Apatite is a group of phosphate minerals with high concentrations of OH−, F−, Cl− or ions, respectively, in the crystal."
Apatite is characteristic of biological systems. It is one of a few minerals produced and used by biological micro-environmental systems. It hardness defines 5 on the Mohs scale. Hydroxyapatite is the main component of tooth enamel and bone mineral.
"Much bone material is in a relatively rare form of apatite. In this form most of the OH groups are absent, and there are many carbonate and acid phosphate substitutions."
"Fluorapatite (or fluoroapatite) is more resistant to acid attack than is hydroxyapatite. In the mid-20th century it was discovered that communities whose water supply naturally contained fluorine had lower rates of dental caries. Fluoridated water allows exchange in the teeth of fluoride ions for hydroxyl groups in apatite. Similarly, toothpaste often includes a source of fluoride anions (e.g. sodium fluoride, sodium monofluorophosphate)."

Black-legged dart frog

Appearance.
"The adult male frog is 32.1-39.5 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 35.7-42.7 mm. It has large disks on its toes for climbing. Young frogs have stripes on their sides. In some groups of this frog, the stripes go away when the frog is an adult. In other places, the adult frogs keep their stripes."
Poison.
Human beings who live where the frog lives have used the frog to poison arrows. The human can touch the arrow to the frog's back without killing it. Or the human can kill and heat the frog's body.
The poison in the frog's skin is a chemical called batrachotoxin. The frog gets the poison from the ants and other insects that it eats. So frogs kept as pets do not have poison.
Threats.
There are fewer of these frogs than there were. Scientisis think this could be because human beings change the places where the frog lives. Humans turn the forests into forms and take the trees for lumber. Human beings also catch these frogs to sell as pets.

"Boy, the way Glenn Miller played"
songs that made the hit parade
Guys like me we had it made
Those were the days
Didn't need no welfare state
ev'rybody pulled his weight
gee our old LaSalle ran great
Those were the days
And you knew who you were then
girls were girls and men were men
Mister we could use a man like Herbert Hoover again
People seemed to be content
fifty dollars paid the rent
freaks were in a circus tent
Those were the days
Take a little Sunday spin
go to watch the Dodgers win
Have yourself a dandy day
that cost you under a fin

History.
"As well, the Mediterranean's sea lanes were opened to the Allies, and Italian dictator Benito Mussolini was briefly removed from power."
Background.
Allies.
"The plan for Operation ""Husky"" called for the sea attack of the island by two armies. One would land on the South Eastern coast. Another would land on the central Southern Coast. The attack would be helped by naval gunfire and bombing. The commander was the American General Dwight D. Eisenhower."
"The Allied land forces were from the American, British and Canadian armies. They were put into two groups. The Eastern Task Force was led by General Bernard Montgomery. The Western Task Force was commanded by Lieutenant General George S. Patton. In addition to the sea landings, airborne troops were to be flown in. They would capture bridges and high ground."
The Allied naval forces were put into two groups to transport the invading armies.
"The island was defended by the two corps of Italian 6th Army under General Alfredo Guzzoni. In early July the total Axis force in Sicily was about 200,000 Italian and 32,000 German troops, and 30,000 ""Luftwaffe"" ground staff. By late July there were 70,000 German troops."
Planning.
The attack plan was made on 17 May.
"At the Casablanca Conference in January 1943, political leaders and the military leaders of the US and Britain met to discuss future plans. The British wanted an invasion of Sicily. General Eisenhower was made Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces."
Preparatory operations.
"Once the Axis forces had been defeated in Tunisia, the Allied bombers attacked the airfields of Sardinia, Sicily and southern Italy. They also bombed industrial targets in southern Italy and the ports of Naples, Messina, Palermo and Cagliari."
Deception.
"To distract the Axis, the Allies did several trick operations. The most famous was ""Operation Mincemeat"". The British allowed a corpse disguised as a British officer to drift ashore in Spain, carrying a briefcase with fake secret documents."
"These stated that the Allies were planning to invade Greece and Sardinia, and had no plans to invade Sicily. The Germans thought the documents were real. The Germans moved much of their defences from Sicily to Greece."
Battle.
Two British and two American attacks by airborne forces were done on the night of 9–10 July. They wanted to capture the bridge over the River Anape. Strong wind made them land in the wrong places. Airborne troops attacked patrols. A platoon captured the bridge and fought off counterattacks for a few hours.
The strong winds made the sea landings hard. Landings were made on 10 July on twenty-six main beaches.
By the evening of 10 July the seven Allied divisions were ashore and the port of Syracuse had been captured.
Alexander's plan was to establish his forces on a line between Licata in and Catania. He wanted to capture ports.

"On the western side, U.S. Fifth Army moved from Naples. In the east General Sir Bernard Montgomery's British Eighth Army moved up the Adriatic coast."
The Fifth Army made slow progress because of difficult land and German defences. The Germans were protected in positions. The original plans that Rome would be captured by October 1943 did not occur.
"Although in the east the Ortona was captured, the advance stopped in December because of snow. Going to Rome from the east was not possible. Highway 6 ran through the Liri valley. The south entrance to this valley was Cassino. It was an important part of Gustav Line, the strongest defensive positions in the Winter Line."
"Because the old Benedictine Abbey was important to history, German units did not put defensive positions in the Abbey."
Some Allied aircraft saw German troops in the Abbey. The Abbey looked over the valley. This made it a good place for German artillery observers. This made Allied commanders want to bomb the Abbey.
First battle.
Plans and preparation.
"The plan of U.S. Fifth Army commander General Clark was for British X Corps to attack on January 17, 1944. The British 46th Infantry Division was to attack on January 19. This would support the main attack by U.S. II Corps on their right."
The main central attack by U.S. II Corps would start on January 20. The 36th (Texas) U.S. Infantry Division would cross a river five miles from Cassino. The French Expeditionary Corps would move towards Monte Cairo.
"Fifth Army had only reached the Gustav line on January 15, having taken six weeks and getting 16,000 casualties."
Attack.
"The first attack was made on January 17. Near the coast, British X Corps crossed the Garigliano. General von Senger, commander of German XIV Panzer Corps did not think he could stop the attack. He asked for more troops. The 29th and 90th Panzer Grenadier Divisions were sent to him. X Corps had 4,000 casualties during the first battle."
"The central attack by U.S. started on January 20. They were attacked by General Eberhard Rodt's 15th Panzer Grenadier Division. The attack was a failure, with 36th Division losing 2,100 men killed, wounded and missing in 48 hours."
The next attack was on January 24. The U.S. II Corps attacked across the
Rapido valley north of Cassino. The 34th Division pushed back General Franek's 44th Infantry Division.
"On the right, the Moroccan-French troops made good initial progress against the Germans. The two Moroccan-French divisions had 2,500 casualties in their battles around Monte Belvedere."
"The U.S. 34th Division had to fight southward. By early February, American infantry had captured point less than a mile from the abbey. By February 7 a battalion had reached a hill below the Abbey. Attempts to capture Monte Cassino were stopped by machine gun fire from the slopes."
Afterwards.
"On February 11, after a 3-day attack on Monastery Hill and Cassino town, the Americans pulled back. U.S. II Corps was tired after two and a half weeks of fighting. They lost 80% in the Infantry battalions, about 2,200 casualties."
Second battle.
"This was called Operation Avenger. With U.S. VI Corps under threat at Anzio, Freyberg asked to help at Cassini. Freyberg thought there was only a 50% chance of success for the attack."
Destruction of the abbey.
"Allied officers started to think the Germans were using the abbey of Monte Cassino as an artillery observation point. The Allies thought of bombing with ""blockbuster"" bombs."
"The bombing in the morning of February 15, 1944 involved 142 Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses heavy bombers followed by 47 North American B-25 Mitchell and 40 Martin B-26 Marauder medium bombers. They dropped 1,150 tons of bombs on the abbey. This turned it into rubble. II Corps artillery shelled the mountain. The German positions above and behind the monastery were untouched."
After the bombing.
Pope Pius XII said nothing after the bombing. Cardinal Secretary of State called the bombing “stupidity.”
It is now known that the Germans had agreed not to use the Abbey for military purposes.
"Following its destruction, paratroopers of the German 1st Parachute Division occupied the ruins of the abbey. They turned it into a fortress and observation post."

"Adelong, New South Wales"
"Adelong is a small town in the Snowy Mountains region of New South Wales, Australia. It is a part of the Tumut Shire. About 1400 people live in the Adelong district, and 829 people live in the town. The town is about 160 kilometres west of Canberra on the Snowy Mountains Highway. The town's name comes from an Aboriginal word meaning ""along the way"" or ""plain with a river""."
History.
"Hamilton Hume and William Hovell were the first Europeans in to visit the area on their way back to Sydney in 1825. They described it as ""rough and difficult country."""
Gold rush.
Adelong was settled between 1840 and 1850. Gold was discovered at Adelong by a William Williams in 1857. The gold was on the top of Victoria Hill and was part of the Old Hill Reef. Alluvial gold was found in both Adelong Creek and Golden Gully in the same year. Adelong quickly became an important goldfield. Adelong Post Office opened on 1 January 1859.
"By 1859 a number of gold reefs were being mined, including the Old Reef and the Great Victoria Mine. Between 1859 and 1876, 3,798 kilograms of gold was mined. During the gold rush the population grew to more than 30,000 people. Over 25 tonnes of gold was mined from 1857 to the close of the mines in 1914. The National Trust of Australia has listed the main street of Adelong and a number of buildings as being important historical places."
A number of narrow tramway tracks were built in the mine area. Adelong is one of the only two gold mining areas in New South Wales known to have used a steam locomotive on its tramways.
"During the gold rush many Chinese people worked in the mines. Many died and were buried in a special part of the Adelong cemetery. The Chinese part of the cemetery was destroyed in the early 1900s. One or two old Chinese and Indian people still lived in Adelong in the 1950s. A small town, Cornishtown, was about a mile west of Adelong till the 1940s."
Farming.
"After the gold rush, farming became the main business in the area. This was mainly Merino sheep and beef cattle. Over the last 20 years a tourists have come to visit because of the pleasant scenery and gold mining history. The famous Adelong Falls, with its rich gold-mining past, is an ideal spot to for a picnic or to explore the local area."

"In 1915, his song, ""Esmeralda"", was played on Broadway. He had a musical on Broadway in 1916, but it did not do well."
"Porter was not doing very well with his music so he went to Paris, France. He was working there when World War I started. He travelled all over Europe, and then joined the French Foreign Legion in 1917. He was a soldier in North Africa, and then he taught American soldiers how to shoot."
Porter was married to Linda Lee Thomas (1883-1954) from 1919 until her death. Some writers have said that Porter also had some gay relationships.
Later life.
Yayoi period
The is a time in the history of Japan which is traditionally dated 300 BC to 300 AD.
History.
"Early evidence of Yayoi culture is found on the island of Kyūshū. Over time, it spread to the island of Honshū."
"Iron and bronze were first used in Japan at about the same time. Iron was used for tools and weapons. Bronze was used for ritual objects such as mirrors, daggers and spears."
"The Yayoi tools included as axes and hoes for agriculture etc., but also weapons such as arrowheads and swords."
Yayoi people.
"The Yayoi people (弥生人 ""Yayoi jin"") were ancient people that migrated to the Japanese archipelago from southeastern China during the Yayoi period (300 BCE–300 CE). Modern Japanese people are direct descedants of the Yayoi and have about 97% Yayoi DNA."
"The Yayoi and the modern Japanese people are closely related to other East Asian (or Mongoloid) people, such as Chinese or Vietnamese people. They belonged to the haplogroup O and spoke the proto-Japonic languages. Most scientists and linguists suggest that they originated somewhere in southeastern China and migrated from their into Japan."
Pepin the Hunchback

William Shakespeare
"William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 – 23 April 1616) was an English playwright, poet, and actor. He wrote 39 plays (with about half of them considered comedies) and two long poems in his lifetime. He lived in Stratford-upon-Avon, in Warwickshire, England. His plays are still performed today. He is often quoted in modern writing."
"Shakespeare wrote his works between about 1590 and 1613. His plays are among the best known in English literature and are studied in schools around the world. Along with writing, Shakespeare also acted in The Chamberlain's Men acting company, starting in 1594."
"Shakespeare wrote plays of different kinds, or genres. There are histories, tragedies and comedies. Shakespeare was the first person ever to write a tragicomedy. (A tragicomedy is a play that mixes comedy and tragedy, with a happy ending.)"
"Shakespeare's plays are written in poetic language. Many of the plays are set in strange, distant places and times. The stories are often exciting, very funny (in the comedies), or very sad (in the tragedies). These stories make people want to know what will happen to the characters. The plays talk about things that are still important today, like love, sadness, hope, pride, hatred, jealousy, and foolishness."
"Shakespeare added new words and phrases to the English language. He created over 1,700 English words. He also made some words more popular."
Life.
"Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon. His date of birth is believed to be 23 April, though the exact date is unknown. He was the third of eight children. Shakespeare was probably educated at the King's New School in Stratford. Latin was popular in grammar schools during the Elizabethan era, so Shakespeare learned Latin very intensively."
"When Shakespeare was 18, he married Anne Hathaway, a 26-year-old woman. Their wedding was rushed because Anne was already pregnant. They had three children: Susanna (who married John Hall); Hamnet (who died at the age of 11 from unknown causes); and Judith (who married Thomas Quiney). By 1592, Shakespeare had become an actor and was becoming well known as a writer of plays."
"Miller formed a large marching band. He tried to modernize military music. Some officers didn't like it, but he continued because other leaders supported him. For example, he combined blues and jazz with the traditional military march. He formed the Army Air Force Band, with 50 members. In the summer of 1944, he took it to England, where he gave 800 performances and recorded a series of records. The music was used in American Forces Network radio broadcasting for entertainment and counter-propaganda against fascism. Miller also talked on the radio. One time, he said:"
"""America means freedom and there's no expression of freedom quite so sincere as music."""
Disappearance.
"On December 15, 1944, Miller was to fly from the United Kingdom to Paris, France, to play for the soldiers there. His plane departed from Clapham and disappeared while flying over the English Channel. There were two other people on the plane: Lt. Col. Norman Baessell and pilot John Morgan."
"There have been many theories about what happened to the plane. According to a 2014 article in the ""Chicago Tribune"", Miller's plane crashed because it had a faulty carburetor."
"In February 1945, Miller's wife, Helen accepted the Bronze Star Medal for him."
Legacy.
Civilian band legacy.
"When Glenn Miller was alive, various bandleaders like Bob Chester imitated his style. In 1942, Miller gave singer Mel Tormé advice about songwriting."
"By the early 1950s, more bands started to copy Miller's style."
"The Miller estate authorized an official Glenn Miller ""ghost band"" in 1946. This band was led by Tex Beneke, former tenor saxophonist and a singer for the civilian band. It was similar to the Army Air Force Band because it had a large string section. At first called the ""Glenn Miller Orchestra Under the Direction of Tex Beneke"", it later became ""The Tex Beneke Orchestra""."
"A film about Miller's life, ""The Glenn Miller Story"", was released in 1953. Because of this, the Miller estate asked Ray McKinley to lead a new ghost band in 1956. This band still tours the United States."
Army Air Force band legacy.
"After Miller's disappearance, his Army Air Force band was decommissioned and sent back to the United States. Another band, called ""the 314"", took its place."
Compositions.
"Miller composed at least fourteen songs, both by himself or with other people. He added lyrics to another song. These and other songs were recorded by Miller's civilian bands and his Army Air Force band."
Grammy Hall of Fame.
"Glenn Miller had three recordings that were put into the Grammy Hall of Fame after he died. This award is for recordings that are at least 25 years old and that have ""qualitative or historical significance."""

The Ghan
"The Ghan is a passenger train between Adelaide, Alice Springs, and Darwin on the Adelaide–Darwin railway in Australia. The train is operated by Great Southern Rail. It takes 54 hours to travel the with a four-hour stop in Alice Springs."
The name.
"The train's name is a short version of its nickname ""The Afghan Express"". This nickname is said to have been first used in 1923 by one the train crew. The train's name honours Afghan camel drivers who arrived in Australia in the late 19th century to help find a way to reach the country's unexplored interior."
"Another view is that the name was an insult. In 1891, the railway from Quorn reached Oodnadatta. This was home to about 150 cameleers, known as 'Afghans'. 'The Ghan Express' name was used by train crews in the 1890s as a joke because, when an expensive sleeping car was put on from Quorn to Oodnadatta, 'on the first return journey the only passenger was an Afghan'. As early as 1924, it was known as 'The Afghan Express' because it was so unreliable, often days, or weeks late. By 1951, when steam engines were replaced by diesel-electric locomotives, the insult of the names, like the cameleers, had faded away. Modern marketing has turned the name into a term of pride in its heritage."

Free State (province)
"The Free State (Afrikaans: Vrystaat, Sotho: Foreistata; before 1995, the Orange Free State) is a province of South Africa. Its capital is Bloemfontein, which is also South Africa's judicial capital, because the Supreme Court is there. The current borders of the province date from 1994 when the Bantustans were dissolved and were merged into the provinces of South Africa. It is also the only one of the older provinces of South Africa not to undergo border changes, not counting the incorporation of the Bantustans."
Orange Free State
"The Orange Free State () was a country in southern Africa. It was ruled by the Afrikaners. It was defeated by the British Empire and its colonies, the British Cape Colony and the Natal Colony, in the Second Boer War. It became the Orange River Colony and later joined with other colonies to make the Union of South Africa."
Bir Tawil
"Bir Tawil or Bi'r Tawīl (بيرطويل in Arabic; Bi'r or بير, meaning water well), is a small, , area. It is along the border between Egypt and Sudan. It is claimed by neither country right now. It is sometimes given the name the Bir Tawil Triangle, because even though it's not an exact triangle, it's made out of two triangles that share a border. The longer side is in the north of the area. It runs along the 22° north circle of latitude."
"The administrative boundary of Sudan and Egypt was made in 1902. Their political boundary was set in 1899. It was set as the 22° north circle of latitude. This area lies south of the 22° parallel. East-to-west, the area is between long in the south. It is long in the north. It is between and wide north-to-south. It is also in size."
"The Bir Tawil area came under Egyptian administration in 1902. This was because it was grazing land of the Ababda tribe based near Aswan, Egypt. At the same time, the Hala'ib Triangle north of latitude 22° north, and northeast of the area, came under Sudanese administration. This was because the tribes of this area were based in Sudan. The two ""triangles"" border at one point, a quadripoint."
History.
"In 1899, the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium Agreement for Sudan set the border between the territories at the 22nd parallel. At that time, the United Kingdom ruled the area. In 1902 the UK drew a separate ""administrative boundary"". Using this boundary, a triangle of land north of the parallel was placed under Sudanese administration. It was because its inhabitants were closer to Khartoum than Cairo, both geographically and culturally. The area was ruled by the British Governor in Khartoum."
"Egypt claims the original border from 1899, the 22° north circle of latitude. This would place the Hala'ib Triangle within Egypt and the Bir Tawil area within Sudan. Sudan claims the administrative border of 1902. This would put Hala'ib within Sudan, and Bir Tawil within Egypt. As a result, both states claim the Hala'ib Triangle. Neither state claims the much less valuable Bir Tawil area, which is only a tenth the size and is landlocked. There is no basis in international law for Sudan or Egypt to claim both territories. It would also be difficult for any other state to claim the area. This is because only Sudan or Egypt border the land. As a result, Bir Tawil is one of the few land areas of the world which is not claimed by any state. The offical currency is the but this is no longer circulated."
Geography.
"In the north of the area is the mountain Jabal Tawil (جبل طويل in Arabic, located at ). It has a height of 459 meters. In the east is Jabal Ḩajar az Zarqā'. It has a height of 662 meters."

He was named Walter Camp Defensive Player of the Week on Sept. 19 following his performance at Michigan State as he had a team-high nine tackles, forced a fumble and returned it for a 75-yard TD and recorded his first career interception."
"He was 2006 team captain with Brady Quinn and Travis Thomas and was selected (picked, chosen) to the second-team All-America squad by the Walter Camp Football Foundation after helping the Irish earn a bid in the Sugar Bowl. Zbikowski was also named a third-team All-American by the Associated Press and was a semi-finalist for the Jim Thorpe Award, presented annually (""annually"" meaning once a year) to the nation's best defensive back. Zibikowski finished with 79 tackles, recovered a fumble for a touchdown against Penn State, and recorded his third career punt return for a touchdown with 52-yarder against North Carolina. Zbikowski accounted for four TDs (two interception returns and two punt returns) in 12 games played in 2006. He finished fourth on the team with 71 total tackles and led the defense with five interceptions while leading the Irish to the Fiesta Bowl. Following the seasons, Zbikowski earned Third-Team Associated Press All-America honors."
"Zbikowski returned to Notre Dame for his fifth year in 2007 with a career high 80 total tackles with a pair of interceptions and fumble recoveries. He continued to shine as a return man, racking up 234 return yards on punts. Graduated in May with degrees in sociology and computer applications."
Professional career.
The club was founded in 1996 and started playing during the 1996/97 season in the Lower Austria Women league. The next year they were promoted to the second women league (East division). In 2001/02 they won the league and were promoted to the ÖFB-Frauenliga where they still are.
Psycho (1960 movie)
Psycho is a 1960 American slasher movie directed by Alfred Hitchcock. It is set in Arizona and California. It is considered to be one of the first modern horror movies since modern horror began in the 1960s.

Slasher movie
"A slasher movie is a horror or thriller movie in which there is a killer hunting after a group of people, picking them off one by one. Often the killer has a powerful weapon, is crazy or insane, and is either unstoppable or cannot die. Common examples of slashers include: A Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th (1980 movie), Halloween (franchise) and Psycho (movie). Stephen King has written several slasher movies."
Silent movie
"A silent movie is a movie made without sound. Silent movies were made from the late 1880s to the early 1930s. They used early cameras that could not record sound. Either the movie was being made before sound cameras were invented, or the movie makers could not afford the expensive new equipment."
"Charlie Chaplin was known as one of the best movie stars during ""The Silent Era"", as it's called today in movie history. Some silent stars also did well in sound movies. Popular silent movies include """", ""A Trip to the Moon"", ""The General"", and ""Metropolis""."
Bernard Greenhouse
"Bernard Greenhouse (born January 3, 1916; died May 13, 2011) was an American cellist. He was particularly famous for playing chamber music and was one of the original members of the Beaux Arts Trio (a group of three musicians: a pianist, violinist and cellist)."
Early life.
"Greenhouse was born in Newark, New Jersey to a musical family. He started to learn the cello when he was nine. He studied with Felix Salmond at the Juilliard School of Music in New York City. Then he studied with the great cellist Emmanuel Feuermann. He was also one of the very few students of the legendary cellist Pablo Casals."
"When he started his career he soon became the principal cellist of the CBS Symphony Orchestra from 1938-1942 and he also played chamber music with the Dorian String Quartet. After his studies with Casals he gave many solo recitals, but most of all he loved chamber music."
Career.
"In 1955, he met the violinist Daniel Guilet and the pianist Menahem Pressler in New York. Together they formed the Beaux Arts Trio. This group became a world famous trio. Bernard Greenhouse played with them until 1987."
"At the time there were a few string quartets who were famous, but the idea of having success as a piano trio seemed strange. However, Columbia Artists asked them to play in 10 concerts, then they were offered 80 concerts. Soon they were performing in Europe and then all over the world, giving about 130 concerts a year in the USA alone and making many recordings."
Bernard Greenhouse taught at the Julliard and Manhattan schools of music in New York and at several other music schools in the USA.
"When he retired he went to live in Massachusetts. There he gave lessons to talented young players, never charging them fees. Greenhouse was given many awards, including the Prix Mondial du Disque and the US Presidential Medallion 1985."
"Greenhouse was still playing the cello at the age of 95. He died in Wellfleet, Massachusetts on Cape Cod, on May 13, 2011."
Beaux Arts Trio
"The Beaux Arts Trio was a famous piano trio. The three musicians (a violinist, cellist and pianist first performed together in public on 13 July 1955 at the Berkshire Music Festival, known today as the Tanglewood Music Center. Their last American concert was held at Tanglewood on 21 August 2008. Their last concert was in Lucerne, Switzerland on 6 September 2008."

Mathematical constant
"A mathematical constant is a number, which has a special meaning for calculations. For example, the constant π (pronounced ""pie"") means the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. This value is always the same for any circle. A mathematical constant is often a real, non-integral number of interest."
"In contrast to physical constants, mathematical constants do not come from physical measurements."

Leaning Tower of Pisa
"The Leaning Tower of Pisa is a building in Pisa, Italy. It is a bell tower. It is famous because it is not vertical. In 1990 the tower was leaning at 5.5 degrees and increasing. After that, much restoration work has been done to stop it from falling over completely. There was scaffolding all around the tower for 20 years. On 26 April 2011, the last bit of scaffolding was removed so that the tower can be seen properly again."
"The height of the tower is about 56 metres from the ground. Its weight is about 14,500 tonnes. It now leans at about 3.99 degrees. The tower has 294 steps."
"When the second floor was built in 1178, the tower started to lean. This was because it had a small three-meter foundation in soft soil. The design of this tower was bad from the beginning. Construction was stopped for almost 100 years because the people of Pisa were often at war with Genoa, Lucca, and Florence."
There is an old story that Galileo Galilei used the Tower for a physics experiment.
Tower
"A tower is a tall structure. Towers are different from buildings because people do not live in them. Many castles have towers. Today, towers are very tall. Some things they are used for are to send radio signals, for observation, or to hold up bridges."
Lachesis (genus)
"Lachesis, also known as the ""bushmasters"", is a genus of venomous Pit vipers found in forests of Central and South America. The name ""Lachesis"" is also the name of one of the Three Fates in Greek mythology. There are currently three species found."
Description.
"Adult bushmasters can grow up to the length of 2 meters (6.5 ft) to 2.5 meters (8.25 ft), but there have been some which have grown up to the length of 3 meters (10 ft). The largest one ever found was 3.65 meters (12 ft) long, making the bushmasters the longest venomous snakes in the Western Hemisphere and the longest vipers in the world. They are not the heaviest vipers in the world, but adults usually weigh up to 3 to 5 kg (6.6 to 11 Ib)."
Where they live.
Bushmasters are found in forest areas of Central and South America. They are also found on the island Trinidad
Reproduction.
"Bushmasters are oviparous: they lay eggs. This makes bushmasters different to other pit vipers found in the New World, because other pit vipers are viviparous, they give live birth instead of laying eggs. A female can lay around a dozen eggs at a time. The female stays with her eggs until they have hatched and may attack any predator that comes near the nest."
Venom.
"The bushmasters are one of the largest and dangerous snakes in South America, and can inject a large amount of venom into their enemies. Even young bushmaster's bites are harmful, but bushmasters are nocturnal (they are active at night), so not a lot of people have been bitten by them."

Great Sandy Desert
"The Great Sandy Desert is a desert in the northwest of Australia, mostly in Western Australia. It is the second-largest desert in Australia (after the Great Victoria Desert). It covers about . South of the Great Sandy Desert is the Gibson Desert, and to the east is the Tanami Desert."
There are not many people living in the Great Sandy Desert. Most of them are Aboriginal communities and mining towns. The Aboriginal people of the desert fall into two main groups: the Martu in the west and the Pintupi in the east. They both speak Western Desert languages.
"The area does not get much rain, but even in the driest parts rainfalls rarely drop below . The rate of evaporation (how quickly the water dries up) is very high. Most of the rain comes from thunderstorms. Many drought years end with a monsoon or tropical cyclone. On average for most of the area, there are about 20-30 days where thunderstorms form."
"Most of the plants growing across the Great Sandy Desert are spinifex grasses. Animals living in the desert include dingos, red kangaroo, monitor lizards, bilbies, marsupial mole, thorny devils, bearded dragons and many other species of lizard."
"The first European to cross the desert was Peter Warburton. He made the journey from Alice Springs leaving in April 1873 and arriving at De Grey Station in January 1874. When Warburton arrived, he was starving and blind in one eye. He thanked his survival on his Aboriginal companion Charley."
The Disrobing of Christ (painting)
"The Disrobing of Christ is an oil painting by El Greco. It was completed in the spring of 1579 for the High Altar of the sacristy of the Cathedral of Toledo, where it still hangs. It measures 285 x 173cm. Harold Wethey says that the painting is a ""masterpiece of extraordinary originality"". The power of the picture depends upon El Greco's original and forceful use of color."
"Arthashastra is an ancient book of India. Kautilya (also known as Chanakya) wrote this book. Kautilya was a minister of Chandragupta Maurya (321 BC – 297 BC), an emperor of Ancient India. After many revisions and additions, the book took its present form about 1800 years before, in the 2nd century."
"The book is divided into fifteen sections. It tells about politics and administration. Different sections of the book talk about many subjects, such as: war and politics ""rule with a harsh hand"""
Hanuman
"Hanuman is one of the most popular gods of Hindus. He is also known by other names like Hanumat. His mother’s name was Anjana. Based on her mother’s name, Hanuman is sometimes called ""Anjaneya"", that is, one born of Anjana. His father’s name was Kesari."
"He is blessed by Vayu as the god of winds. Hanuman’s image shows him as a strong man with the face of a monkey. He also has a tail it represents the morality, higher pride of being self."
Hanuman was awarded boon of Immortality by Mother Sita ( Wife of Lord rama) and is still alive
"Hanuman is a very powerful and strong god. He finds an important place in the Ramayana. He was a devotee of Rama, a form (avatar) of Lord Vishnu, a god of Hindus. Hanuman is a figure of strength, perseverance and devotion. When he was young he thought the sun a mango. One of his most famous stories was when he helped Rama rescue Sita from Ravana which is the famous story of Diwali."
Indra
"(Devanagari: इन्द्र) or is the most important among the Indo-Aryan gods. He is the God of war, the god of thunderstorms. In the Vedas, many verses (hymns) are there in his praise. The Rigveda praises him as a very strong God. Many Hindu scriptures tell about Indra, his character and his deeds."
"Indra resides in a mythical city located above in the sky. The city’s name is Amravati. He lives there with his wife named Indrani, and several other smaller gods. There are many apsaras in amravati."
"Indra was a very important God during the Vedic period. Later his importance became less. Gods like Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva became more important in Hinduism."
"Indra in current form of mythology is similar to that of Zeus in Greek mythology. Though his importance has come down, he is still considered to be king of Gods. His status is below that of Brahma, Vishnu and Siva. Thus, he is considered to be king of lesser Gods."
"Again, his weapon is Vajra which is represented by Thunderbolt! His means, at times, treacherous and he is shown as, at times, jealous and vengeful. Further, he is made to suffer his own bad deeds."

ICS Bégué
ICS Bégué is a French private business school in Paris. It was created in 1957 and is part of IONIS Education Group.
It is recognized by the French State.
Enol
An enol is an alkene that has an OH group attached to one end of the double bond. It is called an enolate if the proton on the oxygen atom is taken away.
"Enols are tautomers of ketones or aldehydes. Tautomers are molecules which are different only in the position of an hydrogen atom. Enols can be made very easily from ketones or aldehydes using a base. They are quite unstable, because the C=O bond is stronger than the C=C bond. However, they can do many interesting reactions. The best example is the aldol reaction."
"Enols of ketones can be made on two different sides. It is important to be able to choose which side to react. The side with less substituents is the easiest one to react: it can be made at low temperature with a bulky base. This is called the kinetic enolate. The other side, with more substituents, is more difficult to react. Higher temperatures are needed. This is called the thermodynamic enolate."
Steric effects
"Steric effects are the effects seen in molecules that come from the fact that atoms occupy space. When atoms are put close to each other, this costs energy. The electrons near the atoms want to stay away from each other. This can change the way molecules want to react. It can also change the shape (or conformation) of the molecule. The amount of space that a group of atoms takes is called the ""steric bulk""."
"An example of steric effects is steric hindrance. This is when a large group in a molecule makes reactions not work. For example, an SN2 reaction does not happen on carbon atoms that have three substituents. Steric hindrance however can also be a positive thing. Sometimes, chemists would like a reaction to happen in one place rather than another one. A bulky group can block a position. It can also change the shape such that only one diastereomer from a reaction is made."
"Steric effects are usually smaller than electronic effects. These affect the molecule's shape and reactivity as well, but they come from the way electrons are placed in bonds."
Motherland Party (Azerbaijan)
"The Motherland Party () is a nationalist and conservative political party in Azerbaijan. It was founded in 1990. Its members are mainly Azerbaijanis who come from Armenia. The party's leader Fazail Agamali is a former deputy minister for social protection. The party's aim is to create a ""free, powerful, democratic and entire Azerbaijan""."
"At the 2010 parliamentary elections, it won 2 out of 125 seats."
Gold rush
"A gold rush is when a lot of miners go to a mining place full of gold. Well-known examples are the California Gold Rush of 1848, the Australian gold rush which began in 1851, or the Fraser river gold rush in British Columbia, Canada in 1858."
California Gold Rush
"The California Gold Rush started when James Wilson Marshall was building a water powered sawmill for John Sutter in 1848. When he finished building the sawmill, he went to the river to fetch some water. He saw some shiny little flakes of gold in the river. He immediately went to tell John, and they tried to keep it a secret. But word soon got out, and the gold rush started."
"It was 1849 when the Gold Rush started. People who came to California for gold were called forty-niners because they came in the year 1849. Some of them became rich but most did not. Some people started selling things. Many of them became rich, famous, and politically powerful. Sometimes a woman could earn more than her mining husband."
Men like Levi Strauss also sold things. He invented and sold jeans made from strong denim. The California Gold Rush ended in 1855. Many gold miners went back home because gold was harder to find; others found other work.
Jeans
"Jeans are a type of pants made from heavy, strong cotton material (fabric) called denim. They were invented in the United States by Levi Strauss in 1872. In the late 1800s, jeans were worn by workers. Jeans are one of the most obvious symbols of American cultural influence in the world. They are worn in many countries around the world."
"In the 1950s, jeans became a popular fashion for teenagers and young adults. In the 1950s, jeans were part of rockabilly fashion for teenagers. Now, jeans are a very popular type of pants. They are usually worn as casual fashion clothing. Jeans are made in many styles and colors."
"The word ""jeans"" came from the French name of the city in Italy where a strong cotton fabric was made. The Italian city's name, Genoa, was spelled ""jene"" in Middle English and ""Gênes"" in the French language."
Sovereignty
Sovereignty is the right of a government to have complete control over its area. The idea that this right comes from doing good things for the people under control of the government is as old as Ancient Greece if not older.
"The exact meaning of Sovereignty has changed some in the past. The present meaning of Sovereignty is said to come from the Peace of Westphalia, an agreement between the rulers of Europe in 1648 which said:"
The Past.
Ancient Rome.
"Ancient Rome was first the Roman Republic, but then when Octavian made the Roman Empire the Emperor of Rome said that he was ""Sovereign"". The meaning of this was that he could make any law he wanted, and he did not have to do what the law said himself."
Middle Ages.
"In the time of the Middle Ages many kings and rulers had to do what other leaders said, such as the leader of the Catholic Church, the Pope. Because of this, the idea of ""Sovereignty"" was not much used."
Reformation.
"In the time of the Protestant Reformation, in the 16th century, governments were breaking away from religious leaders. Also many wars were fought between different rulers inside areas that are now sovereign countries. The English Civil War is one example of a war fought in this time between leaders inside one country."
"The Peace of Westphalia was made in 1648 and the idea of ""Sovereignty"" came back. Governments were now separate from outside leaders and only one government or ruler inside a country could make laws. The divine right of kings became more widespread."
The Enlightenment and Social Contract theory.
"The English thinker Thomas Hobbes wrote a book in 1651 that said rulers and governments are ""Sovereign"" because they are good for the safety of the people. The idea that people could change rulers if they were not safe was new with Hobbes."
Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote a book in 1763 that said the choice of the people is the only thing sovereignty comes from.
"Both Rousseau and Hobbes advanced a ""Social Contract"" in which people consent to a government's sovereignty just by living in the country and that people give up at least some of their liberty for security"
"In 1789 the French Revolution made an important country's government ruled by the choices of the people for the first time after the Middle Ages (some cities and small countries were democracies in the Middle Ages). There were many problems and France went back to the old way soon after, but would be ready for Democracy in 1870's. In England, many people got to vote after The Reform Act in 1832. The United States broke away from England in 1776-1783, but was not an important country at that time."

Linga
"A linga or a lingam is a very complex Phallus symbol of Hinduism. It is associated with Shiva, supreme god in main gods of the Hindus. The Hindu scriptures say that a linga represents energy and strength. In almost all the temples of Shiva, Shiva is shown in the form of a Circumcised linga."
"The Hindu scriptures also say that Shiva took twelve forms as Jyotirlinga, that is, ""a linga of light"". In India, there are twelve places where this form of Shiva is worshiped. The Hindu scriptures also tell about five more forms of lingas. These form of lingas represent the earth, the water, the fire, the air and the sky (or ether). There are five different places in India where Hindus worship these forms of Shiva. These places are located at the following locations:"
"Beside above places, in almost all the towns and villages of India, Shiva’s temples are found. In all such temples, lingas are worshipped."
"Also in other places in the World of Ancient history, Shiva Limgam was worshipped."
United States National Guard
"The United States National Guard is an organization of the United States Army and the United States Air Force. The U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force are both branches of the United States military. The National Guard is a militia (an emergency army) for the United States. Each U.S. State has its own National Guard, usually under the control of that state's government. When needed, they are mobilized under control of the United States."
"There are two parts of the United States National Guard, administered by the National Guard Bureau of the United States Department of Defense. The Air National Guard is part of the United States Air Force; the Army National Guard is part of the United States Army. The two National Guard groups are identified by the kinds of jobs they do. The Air National Guard does mainly air defense jobs, while the Army National Guard does the jobs on the ground."
Bishop's Stortford
"Bishop's Stortford is a town in Hertfordshire in south-east England, with about 35,000 people living there."
History.
People have lived in the area for hundreds of thousands of years but it became a permanent town by the time of the Saxons.
The Domesday Book says there were 120 people living there in the 1100s. The Normans built a small castle there but it was unused and broken by the time of the Tudors.
"The town grew as an important centre for transport. After 1769, ships were able to use the river. It was a stagecoach stop for travel on the road between London and Cambridge. In 1842 the town got a railway station."
"In 1901 there were 7,000 people living there, and by 1951 it was 13,000."
The town is popular for travellers to London because of the M11 motorway (an important road) and good train services to London. Stansted Airport has also caused development.
Raven
"A raven is a big black bird, (""Corvus corax""). It may be called the common raven or the northern raven. It is similar to a crow but bigger. It and the thick-billed raven are the two largest birds in the crow family, and perhaps the heaviest perching birds. The raven's feathers are all black, but a crow has feathers that are white at the bottom. This cannot be seen from a distance."
"The most famous raven is in the Edgar Allan Poe story called ""The Raven""."
"The common raven can be tamed. Some think it is mischievous and sly, and it has been regarded as a bird of evil and mysterious character."
Malnutrition
Malnutrition is eating a diet which does not supply enough nutrients. There are two broad cateogries of malnutrition:
"Sometimes, people need to lose weight, and eat according to a special diet. This is usually not called malnutrition."
"Malnutrition is considered a more scientific and official term than starvation which has negative associations. Malnutrition is not, however, simply a matter of eating too little. Someone can be malnourished if they eat an unhealthy diet. This can be cured by eating a proper balanced diet."
"Children whose daily diet contains less carbohydrate and protein do not grow well. They do not gain weight. Their hands and legs appear as skin and bones. They cry all the time with hunger. They are not active and have sunken eyes. Such children often fall sick. Lack of a particular vitamin is another kind of malnutrition which can cause a particular deficiency disease, such as beriberi and rickets."
"Malnutrition becomes a bigger problem during famine because most of the people do not get enough food, hence increasing the death rate."
"Porter started having musicals on Broadway again in 1926. He wrote some famous songs like ""Let's Do It, Let's Fall in Love"", ""What Is This Thing Called Love?"" and ""Night and Day""."

Jan van Riebeeck
"Johan Anthoniszoon ""Jan"" van Riebeeck (April 21, 1619 – January 18, 1677) was a Dutch colonial administrator and founder of Cape Town, a city in South Africa."
Biography.
"Van Riebeeck was born in Culemborg in the Netherlands as the son of a surgeon. He grew up in Schiedam, where he married 19-year old Maria de la Quellerie on 28 March 1649. (She died in Malacca, now part of Malaysia, on 2 November 1664, at the age of 35). The couple had eight children, most of whom did not live through infancy. Their son Abraham van Riebeeck, born at the Cape, later became Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies."
"Joining the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in 1639, he served in many posts, like an assistant surgeon in the Batavia in the East Indies. He then went to Japan. His most important position was that of head of the VOC trading post in Tonkin, Vietnam. However, he was called back from this post as it was found that he was working trade for his own account."
"In 1651 he was asked to undertake the command of the initial Dutch settlement in the future South Africa. He landed three ships ""Drommedaris"", ""Reijger"" and ""Goede Hoop"" at the future Cape Town on 6 April 1652 and strongly make the site as a way-station for the VOC trade route between the Netherlands and the East Indies. The ""Walvisch"" and the ""Oliphant"" came later, having had 130 burials at sea."
Measles
"Measles is an infectious disease, caused by a virus. People catch measles from other people. It is passed on in tiny drops of water when people breathe. People with measles have a sore throat, a fever, a cough, red eyes and a runny nose. They also have a bumpy red rash all over their body. These rashes will cause a high irritation of itching."
"Measles is very infectious, which means it is easy to catch. If someone in a house has measles, it is very likely that other people in the house will also get it. In developed countries, lots of children have a vaccination (injection) to stop them from getting measles. Often they are given the MMR vaccine, to stop them getting measles, mumps and rubella. The three vaccinations are all in one injection."
"Measles is sometimes also called ""rubeola"", but it is not the same as rubella (German measles). The German Measles (rubella) was discovered by German scientists."
"There is no specific cure for measles. People with measles may rest and take medicines to make them feel better, to stop pain and make fevers go away. Most people that have measles recover, but some people die from it. In the 19th century measles epidemics killed many Polynesian people."
Emperor Seinei
"was the 22nd emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Historians consider details about the life of Emperor Seinei to be possibly legendary, but probable. The name Seinei""-tennō"" was created for him posthumously by later generations."
"No certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as ""traditional"" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty."
Traditional history.
"According to ""Kojiki"" and ""Nihonshoki"", Seinei was a son of Emperor Yūryaku."
Seinei fathered no children. He adopted two grandsons of Emperor Richū. Each would attain the throne; and they would become known as Emperor Ninken and as Emperor Kenzo
Events of Seinei's life.
"Very little is known about the events of Seinei's life and reign. Only limited information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei."
"After the death of his father, Seinei overcame others in the struggle for power."
After his death.
This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Seinei.
"According to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus (""kofun""). This emperor is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (""misasagi"") which is associated with the burial mound."

Determiners.
"Determiners are words placed in front of a noun to make it clear what the noun refers to. The difference is each noun can only have one determiner and the determiner always comes before all the other parts of the noun phrase. The most common determiners in English are ""the"" and ""a/an""."
Adverbs.
"Adverbs are words that tell you about words that are not nouns. An adverb can describe a verb, like the word ""quickly"" in the sentence ""He ran quickly."" They can also describe an adjective. The adverb ""very"" describes the adjective ""sick"" in the sentence ""The boy is very sick."" Adverbs can even describe other adverbs, as in the sentence ""He ran very quickly."""
Prepositions.
"A preposition is a word that describes how one noun (or pronoun) relates to another in the sentence as a whole. The preposition usually comes before the noun that it adds to the sentence, which is called the object of the preposition. An example is the word ""over"" in the sentence ""he walked over the bridge."""
Conjunctions.
"A conjunction is a word that connects other parts of a sentence. It can connect two words that both do the same thing in a sentence. ""And"" in the sentence ""the boy and the girl run"" connects the boy to the girl because they both run. Conjunctions can even connect two clauses that would normally be different sentences together. The word ""but"" in the sentence ""I like cats, but he likes dogs"" is a conjunction doing this."
Interjections.
"Interjections are words that do not fit normal grammar rules. Interjections can and often do take the place of an entire sentence, as they can give they meaning of a whole sentence in a single word. These can be used to show emotions, such as the word ""Hooray,"" which means that the speaker is happy or likes something. They are also used to shorten common phrases that would otherwise need a full sentence to talk about. For example, saying the word ""yes"" is much simpler than saying ""what you say is true,"" so it is usually used instead. Interjections like these can be helpful for saving time and making complex sentences very simple. Often, though, interjections may have no meaning at all, such as the word ""um."""
Syntax.
"Grammar also studies how the parts of language work together. This is called ""syntax."" Some common ways in which the words fit together are sentences, phrases, clauses, and paragraphs."

Wasted username
A wasted username or wasted account is a user account on a website that was not used very much (or at all) after it was made. A person who makes an account like this is called a namewaster or a name waster.
"This word came from YouTube, where many people would post both funny and hateful comments on namewasters' YouTube channels. This was an Internet phenomenon until 2012, when YouTube deleted a lot of these wasted accounts."
Chain mail
"Mail, or chain mail, is a type of armour. It is made of small metal rings linked together in a pattern to form a mesh. The Celts are usually credited with inventing mail armour. Celtic mail was usually made in the form of a vest."
Etymology.
"The origins* of the word ""mail"" are not fully known. One theory is that it originally comes from the Latin word ""macula"", meaning ""spot"" or ""opacity"". Another theory relates the word to the Old French ""maillier"", meaning “to hammer” (related to the modern English word ""malleable""). A mail shirt is a called a hauberk (haubergeon or byrnie). Mail leggings were called chausses. A mail Hood is called a coif and covered the head, neck and shoulders."
History.
"Many scholars think mail was invented by ancient Celts about the 3rd century BC. At that time their iron work was probably the best in Europe. The Romans quickly adopted it for their own army. A shirt of mail armour weighed about . After a battle it was common practice to strip weapons and armour from the dead. Vikings were known to wear mail armor whenever they could get their hands on it. Mail was expensive, time-consuming to make, and required a supply of iron. It became more expensive as improvements were made in materials and workmanship. Mail armour was in use in Europe until the 15th century."
Modern uses.
Mail is today used in gloves to prevent cuts by butchers and firefighters. Some divers wear mail suits when swimming around sharks and particularly when feeding sharks. But mail is heavy and it makes moving around more difficult. Mail is very popular with history reenactors. It is also popular in live action role playing.
Afar Triangle
The Afar Triangle (or Afar Depression) is a low area bordering on the Red Sea. It is part of the Great Rift Valley in East Africa.
"The area overlaps the borders of Eritrea, Djibouti and the entire Afar region of Ethiopia."
Human fossils.
Important fossil specimens of the earliest hominins have been found in this area. These are the earliest of the human clade. The area is thought by some paleontologists to be the cradle of the evolution of humans.
"Many important fossil localities exist in the Afar region. These sites have produced specimens of the earliest (fossil) hominins and of human tool culture, as well as many fossils of flora and fauna."
Geography.
"The Triangle includes the lowest point in Africa, Lake Asal, Djibouti, at 155 m (or 509 ft) below sea level."
"The Awash River is the main waterflow into the region. It runs dry during the annual dry season, and ends as a chain of saline lakes. The northern part of the Afar Depression is also known as the Danakil Depression. The lowlands are affected by heat, drought, and poor air circulation. Some of the lowlands are the hottest places (year-round average temperatures) of anywhere on Earth."
"The Afar Triangle is bordered by high areas, as shown on the topographic map."
Plate tectonics.
"The Depression is a plate tectonic triple junction. This geologic feature is one of earth's great active volcanic areas, so the floor of the depression is composed of lava, mostly basalt."
Other reeds can be made from metal or plastic.
Nuuk
"Nuuk (Danish: Godthaab or Godthåb) is the capital of Greenland. It is around the mouth of island Nuup Kangerlua (Danish: ""Godthåbsfjorden"") on the west coast of Greenland, about 240 km (150 mi) south of the Arctic Circle. The city has a population of 15,047 people."
"It was founded in 1728 by the Norwegian missionary Hans Egede. Egede named the city Godthåb which means ""Good Hope"". Today, the people of Nuuk are mainly Inuit and Danes."
Nuuk is the location of the University of Greenland.
Lumberjack
"A lumberjack is a person who cuts down trees to be made into lumber. Lumberjacks used to cut with axes, but now lumberjacks use chainsaws."
Muhammad
"Muhammad ( – 8 June 632) was an Arab religious, political and social leader. He founded the religion of Islam."
"Born in Mecca, Muhammad's parents died in his childhood and he grew as an orphan. At the age of six, his grandfather Abd al-Muttalib took care of him, though he died just two years later. In young life, Muhammad accompanied his uncle Abu Talib on trade trips. In 610 AD, at the age of forty, while Muhammad was praying, he reportedly met Gabriel and received the first revelation of the Quran. At first, Muhammad preached these revelations to his close friends and family. He started preaching monotheism publicly where he received opposition from the Meccan polytheists. The polytheists boycotted Muhammad for three years, in which Muhammad could barely eat or drink. He was attacked with stones, ridiculed while praying, and eventually forced to leave his hometown of Mecca."
"While Muhammad was traveling towards Medina, he came across Taif and preached there where polytheists threw stones, causing Muhammad to bleed and almost collapse. After reaching Medina with Abu Bakr, the Medinan Muslims helped Muhammad and made a mosque there."
"He is believed to be a descendant of Ishmael, a son of Abraham, and the last of all prophets (""the seal of the prophets""). He is seen as an example for all Muslims to follow."
Life.
Childhood.
"Muhammad was born about 570 AD in Mecca. His father, whose name was Abdullah, died six months before Muhammad's birth. His mother, Amina, died when he was six years old. So, his grandfather, Abdul-Muttalib, took care of him after the death of Amina but he too died two years later when Muhammad was nine. After his grandfather's death, his uncle Abu Talib took care of him and was a support to him for many years of his adult life."
Beginning of the prophethood.
"In 610 AD, when Muhammad was forty years old, he went for a walk to the mountain of Hira near Mecca. According to Muslims, the angel Jibrail (Gabriel) spoke with him in a cave on the mountain. The story says that when Muhammad first saw the angel Gabriel, he fainted because Gabriel was so large. This is what Jibrail said to Muhammad:"
"""Read... in the name of God Who made man from a drop of blood... God is Most Rewarding... He Who taught man to write with pen... and taught man what he knew not."""
"Muhammad went back home to his wife Khadijah and told her what had happened. New revelations came to him commanding him to preach what was being sent ""down"" from God. When Muhammad first started teaching, many of the people of Mecca, who worshipped idols, did not like the things that Muhammad said. But there were also people who listened to his preaching and obeyed his messages. These people were the first of the followers of Islam. Leaders of Mecca punished and tortured the followers of Islam. Some followers of Islam were executed. Muhammad resisted this and continued to teach Islam."
The Hijrah.
"After Muhammad finished in Mecca, he took his message to Medina, where some people learned about him and his followers. They welcomed him into their city, and Muhammad wanted them to convert to Islam. They agreed, and many of his followers went to Medina. This movement from Mecca to Medina is called the ""Hijrah"". The Hijra was also the beginning of the Islamic calendar. Muhammad stayed behind until all of his people left Mecca safely."
"As Muhammad stayed in Mecca, his uncle Abu Lahab trained seven men to kill Muhammad in his sleep. According to history, they did not see him leave Mecca. The men went into his house and found his cousin, Ali. Abu Lahab and his horsemen went to the desert to look for him and his friend, Abu Bakr."
His stay in Medina.
"Muhammad and Abu Bakr arrived in Medina. Some people welcomed Muhammad to their homes. He used his camel to show everyone where he would build his house. Also, the first mosque of Medina, a small place for prayer, was built in the back of this house."
The people in a strong Jewish tribe in Medina disagreed with the teachings and rules set by Muhammad. This tribe told their allies in Mecca to sell all the things and homes that Muslims of Mecca left behind. The Muslims and those from Mecca were advised to fight for their property. Muhammad told them not to do that.
Muslims were called all over Medina to gather at a mosque that Muhammad prayed in. They were told to fight against the people of Mecca who burned down their homes and stole their property.
The wars.
"The Quraysh pagans of Mecca heard about this, and they sent a larger army numbering 1000 warriors to fight the Muslims. They met in Badr, but the pagans were defeated and Abu Jahl, one of the pagan leaders, was also killed."
"But, the Muslims lost the second battle at Uhud. One year after the fight at Badr, the army of Mecca had outside help. Muslim archers failed to listen to Muhammad's instructions and Khalid ibn al-Walid cleverly took advantage of that. Hamza, Muhammad's last uncle, was killed when a slave from Mecca threw a spear into his chest. Muhammad himself was injured."

Kona coffee
"Kona Coffee is one of the kinds of coffee that is made in Kona, Hawaii. And it is famous for being the second most expensive coffee in the world following the Blue Mountains. It is too rare and accounts for only less than 0.1% of all coffee production all over the world."
History.
"In 1825, the person who was one of the royal family of Hawaii went to Britain with the king of Hawaii and brought coffee plants on the way home. Those plants spread to many regions of Hawaii. In 1828, coffee plants were planted in the Kona region. After that, many farms were made there. But, because of pest damage and the price decline of coffee, most farmers quit their jobs. In this situation, Japanese immigrants moved to the Kona region and started to grow coffee to pay their land cost by coffee. This is the beginning of kona coffee. Now, Kona coffee is drunk at the dinner party in White House because this is the only coffee that is grown in America and the quality is quite high."
Distribution.
"Kona is one of the districts of Hawaii, and it is located western. Also,it is the only place which grows coffee in the U.S. states. It has a good natural environment for growing coffee thanks to some volcanoes that give soil many nutrients. Also, the unique oceanic climate of the Kona region, which is cooler and rains a lot more than that of flat ground, is good for growing coffee. Furthermore, there is a terroir that is called “ Kona coffee belt” that is around 32 km long and 3.2 wide area. In this territory, there are many farms and shops that sell Kona coffee directly from the farms and as much as 900,000 kg of coffee beans are harvested annually."
Kona blends and Flavor coffee.
"There are some blended Kona coffees that are made by mixing some kinds of coffee beans because 100% Kona coffee is quite expensive because of labor and land cost. In the Hawaii-grow coffee law, blended coffee that accounted for 10% of Kona coffee beans can be called Kona blended coffee. The coffees that have extra flavor like macadamia nut, vanilla and so on are also famous. Those flavor coffees are made by adding flavor during roasting."
Taste.
"This coffee has a less bitter taste and softly sourness. Because of its great sourness, this coffee is called “Queen of sourness”. You can feel the sweet and fresh smell like tropical fruits. Also Kona coffee is graded 5 stages according to the size of the beans. The bigger beans are graded better and those coffee beans have better taste. The biggest coffee beans are called “extra fancy” and there are only 15 % of Kona coffee. Following “fancy”, “No 1”, “select”, “prime”. Other coffee beans are called “ Hawaiian coffee”. Also, there are coffee beans which are called Peaberry. It is round beans although originally one is half round. Those coffee beans contain more nutrition."

"The league was formed in New York City on June 6, 1946. It was called the Basketball Association of America (BAA). The league merged with the National Basketball League (NBL) in 1949. They then were known as the National Basketball Association. The league's head offices are in the Olympic Tower at 645 Fifth Avenue in New York City. Its international offices are in the same place. NBA Entertainment and NBA TV studios are in Atlanta, Georgia."
"The NBA is widely considered the top level of competition in the world for basketball. With an average player height of about 6 foot 6 inches, it is also the world's tallest sports league."
History of the NBA.
Creation and merger.
"In 1946, The Basketball Association of America (BAA) was formed. Its founders were owners of the major ice hockey arenas in the Northeastern and Midwestern United States and Canada. On November 1, 1946, the Toronto Huskies hosted the New York Knickerbockers. This was the first game played in NBA history. There were earlier attempts at professional basketball leagues. Examples are the American Basketball League and the NBL. The BAA was the first league to play in major cities. They played in large arenas. The level of play in the BAA was not very good. Competing leagues and other teams had similar talent. The Harlem Globetrotters are an example."
"On August 3, 1949, the BAA combined with the NBL. The National Basketball Association was born. The new league had 17 teams. They came from cities of different sizes. The league got rid of several teams. It reached its smallest size of eight teams in the 1954–55 season. They were the New York Knicks, Boston Celtics, Philadelphia Warriors (now Golden State Warriors), Minneapolis Lakers (now Los Angeles Lakers), Rochester Royals (now Sacramento Kings), Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons (now Detroit Pistons), Milwaukee Hawks (now Atlanta Hawks), and Syracuse Nationals (now Philadelphia 76ers). Teams in small cities moved to larger cities."
"Japanese-American Wataru Misaka broke the NBA color barrier in 1947–48. He played for the New York Knicks. But 1950 is recognized as when the NBA integrated. African Americans joined several teams. Those players included Chuck Cooper, Nathaniel ""Sweetwater"" Clifton, and Earl Lloyd. They joined three different teams. During the 1950s, the Minneapolis Lakers won five NBA Championships. George Mikan was their leader. He played the center position. The Lakers were the league's first dynasty. In 1954, the league introduced the 24-second shot clock. A team must try a shot in 24 seconds. If they cannot, the other team gets the ball."
Teams.
The NBA contains 30 teams. 15 are in the Eastern Conference and 15 are in the Western Conference. Each conference has three divisions with 5 teams. Teams play other teams in their division often. All teams play all other teams in a season.
The Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers have won 17 championships each. No other teams have won more championships. Some teams have never won a championship.
29 teams are in the United States. The Toronto Raptors are in Canada. David Stern wants the league to expand to Europe. Some teams have played games in the United Kingdom.
Regular Season.
"Teams begin training camps in September. This allows the coaching staff to observe their players. Teams play preseason games. These do not count for a team's final season record. The weaker players get cut. Other players stay on the team and get paid. The NBA regular season begins in the last week of October. All teams play 82 games during a normal season. There are 41 home games and 41 road (away) games. Home games offer benefits to teams. They generally play better due to fan support and lack of travel. Teams play every other team during the regular season. The best players play in the NBA All-Star game in February. Fans vote for the starters. The coaches vote for the reserve (substitute) players. There is a pause in the season during the All-Star Game. Teams do not play games for about a week. Other events occur during the All-Star break. These include the Three-Point contest, the Skills course, and the Slam Dunk contest. Players participate in part due to fan interest."
"Before the trade deadline, teams can trade players. This can cause changes in the balance of power. Team bosses want to get the best players for their team. Other bosses want to lower their costs. Trades often happen on the last day."
"The regular season ends in the middle of April. Individual awards are given to players. The Most Valuable Player (MVP) award is given to the player most important to his team. The Defensive Player of the Year award is given to the player who plays the best defense. There are a few other awards. After the 2015-2016 season, Stephen Curry became the first player to win all votes for the MVP award."
Playoffs.
"At the end of every NBA regular season, the NBA Playoffs begin. 8 teams from each, the western, and the eastern conference are assigned a seed 1-8. Home court advantage is always determined by seed; higher seed=home court advantage. In the first round of the playoffs, the 1 seed plays the 8 seed;2 plays 7; 3 plays 6; 4 plays 5. All playoff rounds are best-of-7 series, meaning the first team to win 4 games moves on to the next round. Since 2014 every round follows a 2-2-1-1-1 format. The higher seeded team will have home games 1, 2, 5, and 7. The lower seed is home in games 3, 4, and 6."
NBA Finals.
"To win an NBA championship, a team needs to win four rounds. The fourth round is called the finals. A team from the Eastern Conference plays a team from the Western Conference. The team that wins this series is the NBA champion. The best player in the finals wins the Finals Most Valuable Player award. The finals are played in the same format as the other rounds, 2-2-1-1-1. If both teams are the number 1 seed from their respective divisions, the team with the best record will have home court advantage."
FIFA Women's World Cup
The FIFA Women's World Cup is the most important competition in the sport of Women's association football . The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) organizes the World Cup every four years.
"The most successful team has been the United States, with 3 titles."
Nathula
"Nathula is a mountain pass in the Himalayas. It connects Sikkim in India and Tibet in China. It is at a height of 4,500 metres above sea level."
Klondike Gold Rush
"The Klondike Gold Rush happened in the 1890s when many people went to the Klondike region of the Yukon, in Canada. They hoped to find gold there and become rich. Many of these prospectors came from the United States. Gold was first found in Klondike in a creek called Rabbit Creek. Prospectors named the creek ""Bonanza Creek"" because of the gold (""bonanza ""means a lucky source of wealth). Four million dollars worth of gold was found."
"Going to the gold fields was difficult. Most people who started the journey did not arrive. Very few who arrived found any gold. The city that likely profited most from the Klondike Gold Rush was Dawson City, Yukon in Canada."
Clone High
"Clone High is an animated comedy television show about a high school full of clones of famous dead people. It aired on MTV in the US and Teletoon in Canada. It was produced by Nelvana, Touchstone Pictures, Teletoon Canada, and MTV."
Chinese Civil War
"The Chinese Civil War (Chinese ; 中国内战) (Russian ; Гражданская Война в Китае) was a civil war fought from 1927 to 1949 because of differences in thinking between the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Kuomintang (KMT, or Chinese Nationalist Party). The war was a fight for legitimacy of the government of China. The war began in April 1927 because of the Northern Expedition (國民革命軍北伐) and mostly ended in 1950. Some people say the war has not ended, but no large battles have started since that year. Relations between the Republic of China (ROC) and the People's Republic of China (PRC) are still poor because both claim to be the legitimate sovereign government of all of China. The Chinese Civil War was the third-largest war of all time, after World War 1 and World War 2. It was part of the Interwar period in the aftermath of the Great War from 1918 to 1939 and was also part of the Cold War in the aftermath of World War 2 from 1945 to 1949 . The war is usually divided into two parts: 1927-1937 and 1946-1949 . It started and stopped several times before the Second Sino-Japanese War and there was less fighting after the Empire of Japan had invaded. The war between the CCP and the KMT started again in 1946 after Japan's defeat in World War II. The CCP took control of most of China, and the KMT had only islands left. About two million Chinese fled to Taiwan in late 1949. In 1950, no large battles were started. The loss of the KMT in Mainland China is said to be for several reasons:"
"No agreement was made between the two governments and so some say that the war has not ended. Both governments have many military weapons to be used against only against each other, both still say they are the legitimate government of China, and both seek diplomatic relations with other countries as the only legitimate government."
Background and Prelude 1894-1911.
"In 1894 Japan invaded the Qing Dynasty in Manchuria and Taiwan and as well as Korea . In 1899-1901 the Boxer Rebellion happened and Japan invaded China again but allied with Russia, Germany, Austria, France, Britain and America to support Yuan Shikai to stop Empress Dowager Cixi. This led to the fall of the Qing dynasty in the 1911 Xinhai Revolution, the country was thrown into turmoil. In the ensuing power vacuum, a large number of warlords seized control of different parts of the country. To defeat them and unify the country, Sun Yat-sen and his KMT sought help from foreign governments."
"He made pleas to several Western democratic nations, but none offered help cats. It was only after he turned to the Soviets in 1921 that Sun found aid. The communist Soviet Union agreed to help the KMT if the smaller Chinese Communist Party be allowed to join. In 1923 the Soviet Union, the KMT, and the CCP made an agreement, the Sun-Joffe Manifesto, which said the Soviets would help China have only one government. Mikhail Borodin traveled to China in 1923 to help change the KMT to make it similar to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The CCP and KMT were joined in the First United Front."
"In 1923, Chiang Kai-shek travelled to the Soviet Union to study military and politics with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In 1924, he became the leader of the Whampoa Military Academy in China. Most of the help from the Soviet Union was for that school, which taught Soviet political and military ideas to the KMT and the CCP. The Soviets gave books and guns to use for teaching about war and military things. With Soviet help Sun made an ""army of the party"". Members of the CCP were also in the school and some were teachers. Zhou Enlai was a teacher in the school."
"The KMT then agreed to let some communists join the KMT, when the CCP was small compared to the KMT. The CCP had 300 members in 1922 and only 1,500 by 1925. The KMT in 1923, however, had 50,000 members."
The First Chinese Civil War 1927-1936 and the Second Civil War 1945-1949.
In 1927 the civil war in the Republic of China began when the Kuomintang (KMT) became rivals with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and both parties led by Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong were fighting against each other. The Chinese Nationalists got support from the Weimar German Republic and Nazi Germany by buying German Weapons from Europe until the Nazi’s started to support the Japanese Empire in 1937 when the Second Sino-Japanese War began which is the start of World War 2 in Asia .
Nagorno-Karabakh
"Kansas is the 15th-largest state in the United States. It covers an area of 82,282 square miles (213,109 km2). Of this, about 462 square miles (1196.57 km2) are water. This makes up 0.60% of the total area of the state."
"Kansas shares borders with Nebraska to the north, Oklahoma to the south, Missouri to the east, and Colorado to the west. Kansas is just as far away from the Pacific Ocean as it is the Atlantic Ocean. The geographic center of the main 48 states is near Lebanon, Kansas. The geographic center of Kansas is in Barton County."
Geology.
"The underground of Kansas is made of dipping sedimentary rocks, and they are slightly slanted west. A series of Mississippian, Pennsylvanian, and Permian rocks are found in the eastern and southern parts of the state. In the western part of Kansas, Cretaceous can be found sticking up from the ground. This happened because of the erosion from the geologically uplifted Rocky Mountains west of Kansas. Northeastern Kansas was affected by glaciation during the Pleistocene."
Topography.
"All of Kansas is in the Great Plains, where the land is mostly flat with prairies and grasslands. Eastern Kansas has hills and forests, like the Flint Hills and the Osage Plains in the southeastern part of the state."
"Kansas increases in elevation from east to west. The highest place in the state is Mount Sunflower near the Colorado border. Mount Sunflower is 4,039 ft (1,231 m) tall. The lowest point is the Verdigris River in Montgomery County, at 679 ft (207 m) above sea level. It is a common misconception that Kansas is the flattest state – in 2003, a tongue-in-cheek study famously said the state is ""flatter than a pancake"". Kansas has a maximum topographic relief of . This makes Kansas the 23rd flattest U.S. state."
Rivers.
About of the Kansas's northeastern border is the Missouri River. The Kansas River is created by the junction of the Smoky Hill River and Republican River. This happens at Junction City. The Kansas River then joins the Missouri River at Kansas City. It goes across the northeastern part of the state.
The Arkansas River (pronunciation varies) starts in Colorado. It goes for about across the western and southern parts of Kansas.
"Kansas's has other rivers. There is the Saline River and the Solomon River. They are tributaries of the Smoky Hill River. The Big Blue River, the Delaware River, and the Wakarusa River flow into the Kansas River. The Marais des Cygnes River is a tributary of the Missouri River. Spring River is between Riverton and Baxter Springs."
National parks and historic places.
Areas under the protection of the National Park Service include:
Plants and animals.
"In Kansas, there are currently 238 species of rare animals and 400 rare plants. Among those include: ""Boechera laevigata"", Virginia Rail, Cleft Ledge, Royal Fern, Turkey-tangle, Bobolink, Cave Salamander, Peregrine Falcon, and Black-footed ferret. Common animal species and grasses include: Crows, Deer, Lesser Prairie Chicken, Mice, Moles, Opossum, Prairie Dogs, Raccoon, ""Tripsacum dactyloides"", Prairie Dropseed, Indian Grass, Little Bluestem, Switch Grass, Northern Sea Oats, Tussock Sedge, Sideoats Grama, and Big Bluestem."
Weather.
"The Köppen climate classification says that Kansas's climate has three types depending on where in the state it is: it has humid continental, semi-arid steppe, and humid subtropical. The eastern 2/3 of the state (especially the northeastern part) has a humid continental climate. This means it has cool to cold winters and hot, often humid summers. Most of the precipitation happens during both the summer and the spring."
"The western 1/3 of the state – from about U.S. Route 83 to west of it – has a semiarid steppe climate. Summers are hot, often very hot, and generally less humid. Winters vary a lot. Winters can be anything between warm and very cold. The western region gets an average of about of precipitation per year. Chinook winds in the winter can warm western Kansas all the way into the range."
"The far south-central and southeastern parts of Kansas, including the Wichita area, have a humid subtropical climate. This means it has hot and humid summers, and it has milder winters. It also has more precipitation than other places in Kansas. Some things about three climates can be found in most of Kansas. Many parts can get droughts and varied weather. Places can be dry or humid. Places can get both warm or cold in the winter."
"Temperatures in many areas in the western half of Kansas reach or hotter on most days of June, July, and August. Because of the high humidity, the heat index can be deadly, especially in Wichita, Hutchinson, Salina, Russell, Hays, and Great Bend. Temperatures are often high in Dodge City, Garden City, and Liberal, but the heat index in those three cities is usually lower than the actual air temperature."
"Temperatures of or higher are not as common in the eastern half of Kansas. However, higher humidity and the urban heat island effect make most summer days reach between and in Topeka, Lawrence, and the Kansas City metropolitan area. During the summer, the low temperatures each night in the northeastern part of the state don't get colder than very often. Also, because of the humidity being between 85 and 95 percent, dangerous heat can be felt all day."
"Kansas has a varied climate with an average yearly temperature of 56°F (13°C). The highest temperature ever in Kansas is 121 °F (49.4 °C). This happened in Fredonia on July 18, 1936, and in Alton on July 24, 1936. The lowest temperature ever in Kansas is -40 °F (-40 °C). This occurred in Lebanon on February 13, 1905. Kansas is in a temperate area of the country. Like other states in this region, Kansas has four distinct seasons."
"Kansas can have extreme weather in all four seasons. For example, in spring and autumn, Kansas has many tornadoes. In fact, Kansas gets about 55 tornadoes per year. This is because Kansas is in the area known as Tornado Alley, where cold and warm air masses come together to make severe weather."
"In summer, Kansas has experienced severe droughts. For example, in 1934, 1936, and 1939, Kansas had less than average rainfall and widespread dust storms as a part of the Dust Bowl."
"In winter, Kansas has snow in most parts of the state. The average snowfall in the northern half of the state is 16 inches, with the average snowfall in the southern half of the state being 8 inches. Blizzards and related snowstorms are rare in Kansas."
Cities and Counties.
Kansas is organized into 105 counties. Each county has a county seat. There are 627 incorporated cities in Kansas.
"Wichita is the biggest city in Kansas; it has almost 400,000 people. It is in Sedgwick County, which has about 520,000 people. Sedgwick County has the biggest city in Kansas, but it does not have the most people of any county in Kansas; Johnson County has more than 600,000 people. Johnson County has four of the biggest cities in Kansas: Overland Park, Olathe, Shawnee, and Lenexa. They are all suburbs of nearby Kansas City. Topeka is the capital of Kansas. Lawrence is a college town between Kansas City and Topeka."
People.
"Kansas had 627 cities in 2008. The largest city in Kansas is Wichita, which had a population of 382,368 in 2010. The other largest cities in Kansas are: Overland Park, 173,372; Kansas City, 145,786; Topeka, 127,473; and Olathe, 125,872. Between the years of 2000 and 2010, the Kansas population increased 6.1 percent."
Ancestry.
The 2010 Census says that the people of Kansas were:
Producing output.
"Printers are programmed using a programming language. The printer interprets the program, and the outputs the result. There are two big classes of such languages: Page description languages, and Printer Control languages. A page description language describes what a page should look like. The program in a page description language is sent to the printer, which interprets them. Printer command languages are at a lower level than Page description languages, they contain information that is specific to the printer model."
Common programming languages for printers include:
Cost of printers.
"When comparing the cost of a printer, people often talk about how expensive it is to print one page. This cost usually has three components:"
"Printers that are more expensive to buy will usually be less expensive in the consumables (the ink, toner, or ribbon used by the printer). Therefore, laser printers are often more expensive to buy than inkjet printers, but are not as expensive to use over a long period of time. Inkjet printers on the other hand cost more to use because the ink tanks they use are more expensive than the toner for a laser printer."
"Laser printers that can print in color are usually more expensive than those that only print in black and white. Some expensive printers can do other things such as print on both sides of the paper, automatically sort the output, or staple the pages."
Chasing Vermeer
Chasing Vermeer is a children's novel. It is about two children noticing strange coincidences relating to art. The book was written by Blue Balliett and published (printed) by Scholastic in 2003. It says many things about the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer.
"The sequel to the book is ""The Wright 3""."
Great Wall of China
"The Great Wall of China is an ancient wall in China. The wall is made of cement, rocks, bricks, and dirt. It was finished in 1878 and it was meant to protect the north of the empire of China from enemy attacks. It is the longest structure humans have ever built. It is about 21,196 kilometers long, wide and 15 metres high. The earlier sections on the wall are made of compacted dirt and stone. Later in the Ming Dynasty they used bricks. There are 7,000 watch towers, block houses for soldiers and beacons to send smoke signals."
"Nineteen walls have been built that were called the Great Wall of China. The first was built in the 7th century BC. The most famous wall was built between 226–200 BC by the first Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang (Qin Pronounced as Chin) , during the Qin Dynasty. Not much of this wall remains as people have been stealing from it. It was much farther north than the current wall. The current wall was built during the Ming Dynasty."
History.
Great Wall of Qi was started in 685 BC. The state of Qi made a fortified wall for protection against the Southern states Ju og Lu and later from the kingdom Chu.
The state of Yan built walls during the rule of King Zhao of Yan (311–279 BC).
"The state of Zhao built walls during 325–299 BC, during the rule of king Wuling of Zhao."
"Walls on the periphery of the Northern states Yan, Zhao, and Qin became linked together, because all those states came under the rule of emperor Qin Shi Hong, during his rule (221–206 BC)."
"The First Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang also called Shi Huangdi, started the Qin Dynasty. The Xiongnu tribes in the north of China were his enemies. The land in some parts of China is easy to cross, so Qin Shi Huang started building the Great Wall to make it more difficult for the Xiongnu to invade China."
"By 212 BC, the wall went from Gansu to the coast of South Manchuria."
"Other dynasties in China had worked more on the wall and made it longer. The Han, Sui, Northern and Jin Dynasties all repaired, rebuilt or expanded the Great Wall. During the Ming Dynasty, major rebuilding work took place. Sections of the wall were built with bricks and stone instead of earth. It took more than 2000 years for building and completion of the Great wall."
"The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications that were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states. It is the longest structure humans have ever built. It is about 21,196 kilometers long, 9.1 metres (30 feet) wide and 15 metres high. It is made over the course of hundreds of years, the wall was built by over 6 different Chinese dynasties, and is over 2,300 years old."
"The wall was built to help keep out northern invaders like the Mongols. Smaller walls had been built over the years, but the first Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, decided that he wanted a single giant wall to protect his northern borders. The most well-known sections of the wall were built by Ming Dynasty. Genghis Khan, the founder of the Mongol Empire, was the only one who breached the Great Wall of China in its"
"2,700-year-history."
The Great Wall was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987. The Great Wall was declared as one of the Seven Wonders of the World in 2007.
Construction and rebuilding of the Great Wall.
"Builders used materials that were nearby. Some parts of the wall were made of mud, straw, and twigs. Thousands of workers died from giant falling stones, exhaustion, disease, animal attacks, and starvation. Workers dying and being buried in and under the Great Wall is a myth."
Visibility from space.
"Rumours about astronauts being able to see the Great Wall from the moon are scientifically not proven. The Great Wall has shown up in radar images taken from space, but scientists are sure it is not possible for astronauts to see the wall with a naked eye. One astronaut who spoke about the visibility of the Great Wall from space was Neil Armstrong. He said that on the moon, it was very clear that the wall was not visible. However, astronaut William Pogue was able to see the wall from a Low Earth Orbit distance (300-530 km height), but only with binoculars and with lots of practice."
Jesus told this parable after he taught his disciples how to pray the Lord's Prayer.
The parable is therefore an incentive to pray. The parable of the Unjust Judge has a similar meaning.
Depictions.
"The most famous depiction of this parable is ""The Importunate Neighbour"" (1895) by William Holman Hunt, kept at the National Gallery of Victoria, Australia."
Onon (river)
"The Onon gol (Mongolian: Онон гол, Russian: Онон) is a river in Mongolia and Russia. It is 818 km long. Its watershed is 94,010 km2. It starts at the Khentii Mountains, on the Eastern slopes. 298 km of the river is in Mongolia. It has a confluence (the place where two rivers join together) with the Ingoda River. When they meet, it makes the Shilka River. People believe that Genghis Khan was born near the upper Onon and he grew up there. The rivers Onon—Shilka—Amur makes one of the world's ten longest rivers (their lengths, in order: 818 km, 560 km, 2,874 km)."
Entscheidungsproblem
"The Entscheidungsproblem (German, ""decision problem"") is a famous problem of mathematics. David Hilbert formulated the problem in 1928: Is there an algorithm that will take a formal language, and a logical statement in that language, and that will output ""True"" or ""False"", depending on the truth value of the statement? The algorithm does not tell how it reaches the answer, nor prove it, as long as the answer is always correct."
"In 1936 and 1937, Alonzo Church and Alan Turing showed independently, that there can be no answer to the Entscheidungsproblem. They showed that it is impossible for an algorithm to decide whether statements in arithmetic are true or false. For this reason, there can be no solution for the Entscheidungsproblem . This was proven by Alan Turings ""Turing Machine"" which was created in the 1930s."
Turing's Proof.
"Turing proposes a computer program that can determine for certain if any program fed into it will halt or not. He also proposes another program that halts if the input is loop, and loops if the input is halt. He says to make these two programs one new program. Then, he proposes to feed this new program's code into itself. This means the program thinks it will halt, so it will loop, but then it'll loop, so it'll halt, and so on and so forth. This is a paradox, which means for certain that you cannot write a program to determine if every program will halt or not."
Bessie Coleman
"Elizabeth ""Bessie"" Coleman (January 26, 1892 – April 30, 1926) was the first female African American pilot ever to hold an international pilot license. She fought discrimination to follow her dream of becoming a pilot. She became a skilled barnstormer and aviation educator."
Early Life.
"Coleman was born in Texas in 1892. Her mother was African American and her father was Native American. She had two brothers and a young sister. Her parents were sharecroppers. When Coleman was two, her family moved to Waxahachie, Texas where Bessie went to school. She loved reading and was very good at math. Her father hoped to get a job."
Coleman’s father was disturbed by the racial barriers in Texas. He believed that the family would be treated better if they moved to Indian Territory in Oklahoma.
"Unable to convince his wife to accompany him, Coleman’s father left the family when she was nine. Around that time, her older brothers grew up and moved away. Coleman’s mother worked as a maid. Coleman helped take care of her younger sisters."
"During the cotton harvest, everyone in the family worked in the fields to earn extra money. It was hot, boring work, and during the harvest, African American children could not go to school. Still, Coleman managed to finish all eight grades in the local school. Coleman decided that she wanted to go to college, so she saved her money. In about four years, she had enough money to begin college. A year later, she ran out of money."
"At the age of 23, Coleman boarded a train and made the trip to Chicago. She moved in with her brothers and their wives. Coleman took class to learn to become a manicurist, and soon found a job at the White Sox Barber Shop on Chicago's Southside. But Coleman wanted to do something more with her life."
Flying.
"Her friend Robert Abbott told her that she could travel to France to fly. She studied the French language after work at night. She got a new job managing a restaurant and saved her money. Robert Abbot and her friends helped her pay for the trip. In 1920, Coleman went to France on a ship. She learned to be a pilot at the Caudron Brothers' School of Aviation. In 1921, Coleman became the first female African American pilot ever to hold an international pilot license. She earned it from the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale."
"Coleman went back to the United States to work as a barnstormer, performing tricks and stunts in her airplane. Barnstormers like Coleman flew planes in loops and figure eights and other patterns while audiences watched. Coleman performed in the United States and Europe. In the 1920s, much of the United States still practiced racial segregation. Coleman refused to perform at places that did not let African Americans watch equally. For one show in Texas, Coleman refused to perform unless the showrunners let everyone in the audience enter through the same gate instead of making one gate for white people and one for black people. She also taught flying lessons and encouraged women to learn to be pilots."
Coleman wanted to open an aviation school in the United States where black students could learn to be pilots.
"In April 1926, Coleman and her mechanic, William Will, were practicing for a performance the next day. Will was piloting the plane, when it flipped over and started to dive. Coleman fell out of the plane and was killed. She is buried in Chicago's Lincoln Cemetery."
Legacy.
Coleman is in the Aviation Hall of Fame.
"In 1929, William Powell started the Bessie Coleman Aero Club in her honor. The Club promoted aviation among black Americans, and it allowed men and women to join."
"In 1995, the U.S. Post Office issued a stamp in her honor. A Chicago street was named after her."
Tony Danza
"Tony Danza (born Anthony Salvatore Iadanza; April 21, 1950 in Brooklyn, New York) is an American actor, producer and boxer. His mother was an immigrant from Sicily; his father was a sanitation worker. Danza made his big screen debut in the 1981 movie Going Ape!. Danza was also the host of the ESPY Awards in 1996 and Miss America in 2002."

John McDouall Stuart
"John McDouall Stuart (7 September 18155 June 1866) is regarded as one of Australia's greatest explorers. He went on seven major exploring trips into the centre and north of Australia. He was leader of six of these expeditions. He spent more time out in the Australian bush exploring the land than any other explorer. On each trip, he was able to go further north and found water sources that helped him with his final long journey. In 1862, he crossed Australia from Adelaide, South Australia, to Van Diemen Gulf in the Northern Territory. He was the first European to cross the continent from north to south and then return again."
"Exploring Australia caused Stuart to become very sick from diseases such as scurvy and beriberi. He pushed himself to the very limits of human endurance. Each trip left him weaker and at the end of his last trip he was unable to walk or ride and had to be carried back. Stuart's discoveries opened up the country for the growth of farming sheep and cattle. His route was used to build the Australian Overland Telegraph Line from Adelaide to Darwin which joined an undersea line from Java. This meant that for the first time, Australians could communicate quickly with the rest of the world. But his personal rewards were small. He was given some land by the government and a small salary from his employers. Stuart died poor in England at the age of 50."
Early life.
"Stuart was born on 7 September 1815, at Dysart, Fife, Scotland. His father, William Stuart, had been a captain in the British Army. His mother was Mary McDouall. They had nine children, John McDouall was the sixth. His parents died when he was ten years old. The children were separated and sent to live with different relatives. Stuart was educated at the Scottish Naval and Military Academy in Edinburgh. He studied to be an engineer and surveyor."
Australia.
"In 1839, Stuart moved to Adelaide, South Australia, and began work as a surveyor. Adelaide had only been settled for two years and was mainly still a tent city. The government needed to have maps so that land could be sold or leased. Stuart worked for three years on the edges of the settled areas, measuring the land and dividing it into farm blocks. He learned skills to live and travel in the Australian bush. He was known as a heavy drinker, often spending days at a time drunk. When a recession hit the South Australian economy, Stuart found himself without a job."
Central Australian Expedition 1844.
"Stuart joined Charles Sturt's Central Australian Expedition to search for an inland sea in August 1844. Sturt was so sure that there was an inland sea in the centre of Australia, that he took a large boat as part of his equipment. Stuart joined the group as a draftsman, who would draw up the maps. He was paid one pound a week, and provided with food. Stuart and James Poole, the second in command, were sent out ahead of the main group to find water. The main group could only travel as fast as their flock of sheep could walk. Stuart and Poole found water at Depot Glen, near the current site of Milparinka."
"In the hot dry climate of summer, the group remained trapped at the waterhole for seven months. Stuart took a small group to find water to the north, west, and east, but found none. Stuart was left behind in charge of the main group at Depot Glen. It was very hot so they dug an underground room to keep cool. All the men became sick from scurvy because of the lack of fresh fruit and vegetables. This caused their gums to become soft and their teeth to fall out. They had headaches, their noses bled, and their skin began to turn black. When Poole died, Stuart was made second in command. He also became the surveyor and did all the mapping as Sturt could not see properly. When it finally rained the group tried to keep going north but were blocked by the sand dunes of the Simpson Desert. They turned south and went back to the Darling River. Stuart took over as leader when Sturt became blind and too ill to lead the group. They arrived back in Adelaide after six weeks hard travelling. Sturt had to be carried in a cart, and Stuart, crippled with scurvy and beriberi, looked like a skeleton."
"It took Stuart nearly a year to recover from the expedition. He wrote in a letter: ""I lost the power of my limbs for ... six months, and was quite unable to do anything for myself for ... twelve months."" For the next few years he was unable to work. The money he had made was spent on doctors and living expenses. In 1849 he moved to near Port Lincoln on the Eyre Peninsula and worked on a farm. He soon found work surveying in the area, and met William Finke and James Chambers. Finke and Chambers were rich men and they paid Stuart to explore for them. They wanted him to find them new farm lands and water, as well as minerals like gold and copper."
"Arad, Romania"
"Arad (pronunciation in Romanian: ; Hungarian: ""Arad""; Serbian: Арад, ""Arad"") is the capital city of Arad County, in the western part of Romania, in Crişana, Ardeal. It is found on the Mureş River."
Transsexual
Transsexual people are people who change their appearance to more closely resemble that of the opposite sex. Transsexuals may be male or female. They typically take hormones and often undergo surgeries to support this process. They usually adopt a new name and may legally have their name changed.
People who go from male to female (MTF) are referred to as transsexual women. People who go from female to male (FTM) are referred to as transsexual men.
Ways to go from male to female.
"Transsexual women take female hormones. They may also take drugs that stop male hormones called androgens. Taking estrogen pills makes breasts grow. It does not make beards go away. It does not make voices higher. Transgender women may remove their facial hair so it does not grow back. This takes a long time and hurts. Some transsexual women with low voices have surgery to raise their voices. Other transsexual women try to make their voice sound higher and more female without surgery. Some transsexual women also get surgery on their genitals. This is called a vaginoplasty. This is done by making a vagina from the skin of their penis, which is turned inside out. Some transsexual women also have surgery to make their faces look more feminine. Some also have surgery to make their breasts larger."
Ways to go from female to male.
Transsexual men take male hormones. This will make their voices lower. It will make a beard grow. It can also stop their menstruation. Some transsexual men look like any other man after hormones.
"Some transsexual men have surgery. One surgery is removal of breasts (mastectomy). Some transsexual men also get surgery on their genitals. One surgery is removal of the uterus and ovaries (hysterectomy). Some may also get surgery on their outside genitals. One way takes their skin and tissue and makes it into a penis (phalloplasty). Another way takes the clitoris (which grows bigger with hormones) and puts it where the penis usually is (metoidioplasty). The place where urine comes out (urethra) can be run through the new penis. The phalloplasty looks more like a penis. A metoidioplasty has more sexual function, but it is 5 or 6 centimeters long. Some ways also make a scrotum from the labia. They may also have the vagina taken out or closed."
Detransitioning.
"Very rarely, some people (called ""detransitioners"") who have changed sex decide this was a mistake and return to living as members of the sex in which they were born."
Some of the effects of surgery and hormones can be reversed but others are permanent.
Pianist
A pianist is a person who plays the piano.
"A pianist can play music for piano alone or play together with other musicians in an ensemble or orchestra. Pianists also play along singers, solo musicians, and other performers in their leading performance."
Telephone book
A telephone book or phone book or telephone directory is a book that has lists of telephone numbers of people and businesses. People use phone books to look up the phone numbers of people and places when they need to call them. One example of a telephone book is Yellow Pages.
French dip sandwich
"The French dip sandwich is a popular dish. It is a sandwich, usually on French bread, with roast beef on the inside. It comes with a special sauce called ""jus"" which is usually made with the juice and fat that came off the roast beef when they were cooking it. It was not originally from France; two restaurants in Los Angeles, California, ""Cole's"" and ""Philippe's"", both claim to have invented it."
Coventry
Coventry is a city in England. Coventry is the ninth biggest city in England. It is also a metropolitan borough. It is in the West Midlands county. It used to be in Warwickshire.
"During the 19th century Coventry became a great manufacturing area, especially for bicycles. In the 20th century it made many motor cars. It also made aeroplanes. It was badly bombed in World War II. During the November 1940 bombing, the city's cathedral was destroyed. A new cathedral was built after the war."
The city has two universities. Coventry University is in the city centre. The University of Warwick is in the south of Coventry.
The local football team is Coventry City F.C..
"Coventry was UK City of Culture in 2021. Coventry is located on the Birmingham arm of the West Coast Main Line. There are four railway stations, the main Coventry station and three local stations at Canley, Coventry Arena and Tile Hill."
"Many of George Gershwin's songs were first written for musical plays performed in theaters in New York City. These comedies, with plenty of songs, were a popular form of entertainment in the 1920s and 1930s."
"One of Gershwin's musical plays, ""Girl Crazy,"" introduced a young singer named Ethel Merman. She became one of the most celebrated performers in America. In the play, Merman sang a song George Gershwin wrote just for her. It was called ""I Got Rhythm""."
"Many songs that George Gershwin wrote for musical plays and movies have remained as popular as ever. Over the years, they have been sung and played in every possible way—from jazz to country."
"One example is the song, ""Someone to Watch Over Me."" It was written for the 1926 musical ""Oh, Kay!"""
Jazz and his music.
"In the nineteen twenties, there was a debate in the United States about jazz music. Could jazz, some people asked, be considered serious music?"
"In 1924, jazz musician and orchestra leader Paul Whiteman decided to organize a special concert to show that jazz was serious music. Gershwin agreed to compose something for the concert before he realized how little time he had to do it. The concert was just a few weeks away. Gershwin got busy, and, in that short time, he composed a piece for piano and orchestra. He called it ""Rhapsody in Blue."""
"Gershwin himself played the piano part of ""Rhapsody in Blue"" at the concert. The audience included some of the greatest classical musicians of the time. When they heard his music, they were electrified. It seemed to capture, for the first time, the true voice of modern American culture. Today, we can still hear Gershwin playing ""Rhapsody in Blue."" An old mechanical piano recording Gershwin created has been reproduced exactly. There are also very early versions of ""Rhapsody in Blue"" which feature Gershwin playing the piano with Whiteman's orchestra. Those recordings, because they are early, do not sound like modern recordings. But they are recordings of Gershwin at the piano. This makes those recordings important."
"""Rhapsody in Blue"" made George Gershwin famous all over the world. Several hundred thousand copies of the printed music sold immediately. Gershwin was satisfied that he had shown that jazz music could be both serious and popular."
Musical works and opera.
"Gershwin also wrote an opera, ""Porgy and Bess. "" It was based on a book by DuBose Heyward. It is a tragic love story about black Americans along the coast of South Carolina."
"""Porgy And Bess"" opened in Boston, Massachusetts in 1935. Audiences loved it. But most critics did not know what to think of it. It was not like any other opera or musical play they had ever seen."
"Gershwin did not care about the critics' opinions. He believed some of his greatest music had gone into the opera. He said he had created a new musical form—an opera based on popular culture. Today ""Porgy And Bess"" is considered a masterpiece."
"Another well-known Gershwin piece is ""An American in Paris. "" It is a long tone poem for orchestra. Its first public performance was by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra in 1928."
"Once again, opinion was mixed. Most people loved ""An American in Paris,"" as they loved all of Gershwin's music. Some critics liked it, too. They called it happy and full of life. Others hated it. They called it silly and long-winded."
Last days.
"George Gershwin died in 1937, just days after doctors learned he had brain cancer. He died while having surgery to remove the brain tumor. He was only thirty-eight years old. Newspapers all over the world reported his death on their front pages. Everyone mourned the loss of the man and all the music he might have written. Gershwin is still considered one of America's greatest composers. His works still are performed by many singers and groups. They are probably performed more often than any other serious American composer."
"Austrian composer Arnold Schoenberg was one of the people who praised George Gershwin. Schoenberg said Gershwin was a man who lived in music and expressed everything through music, because music was his native language."
Aaron Copland
"Aaron Copland (, ; November 14, 1900December 2, 1990) was an American composer who wrote modern music."
"Aaron Copland wrote many kinds of music. He wrote music for the orchestra, piano, and voice. He wrote music for plays, movies, and dance. Copland also was a conductor, pianist, speaker, teacher, and writer."
Music critics say Copland taught Americans about themselves through his music. He used parts of many old American folksongs in his work. He wanted to do this after studying music in France. He said that composers there had a very French way of writing music. He said Americans had nothing like that in this country. So he decided to compose music that was truly American.
Early days of Copland.
"Aaron Copland was born November 14, 1900 in Brooklyn, New York. He died at the age of 90 on December 2, 1990. He was the youngest of five children. His parents had come to the United States from eastern Europe. They owned a store in Brooklyn. Aaron began playing the piano when he was a young child. He wrote his first song for his mother when he was eight years old. His dreams of becoming a composer began when he was young. When he was sixteen, he asked his parents to let him study composing with Rubin Goldmark. Goldmark had taught the composer George Gershwin."
"When he was in his early twenties, Copland went to Paris, France, where he studied music with Nadia Boulanger. She was one of the most important music teachers of the time. He returned to New York in 1924."
Known classical works.
"The famous conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Serge Koussevitzky, learned about Copland's music. Koussevitzky led the orchestra for the first performance of Copland's early work, ""Music for the Theater"", in 1925. Koussevitzky also conducted Copland's ""Concerto for Piano and Orchestra"" in 1927. This work was unusual because Copland used ideas from jazz music in his concerto."
"Copland later wrote the music for two ballets about the American West. One was about the life of a famous gunfighter called Billy the Kid. Copland used music from American cowboy songs in this work. This piece from ""Billy the Kid: Ballet Suite"" is called ""Street in a Frontier Town""."
"In 1942, the conductor Andre Kostelanitz asked Copland to write music about a great American, Abraham Lincoln. Copland wrote ""Lincoln Portrait"" to honor America's 16th president. Copland's music included parts of American folk songs and songs popular during the American Civil War. He added words from President Lincoln's speeches and letters."
"""Lincoln Portrait"" has been performed many times in America. Many famous people have done the speaking part.Eleanor Roosevelt, the wife of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, was one of them. Here, actor James Earl Jones performs in Copland's ""Lincoln Portrait."""
"In 1942 the music director of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra asked 18 composers to write music expressing love for America. For the competition, Copland composed ""Fanfare for the Common Man. "" This music is played in America during many national events, including some presidential inaugurations (when they become presidents)."
"Throughout modern times, the largest known prime number has very often been a Mersenne prime. Most sources restrict the term ""Mersenne number"" to where ""n"" is prime, as all Mersenne primes must be of this form as seen below."
"Mersenne primes have a close connection to perfect numbers, which are numbers equal to the sum of their proper divisors. Historically, the study of Mersenne primes was motivated by this connection; in the 4th century BC Euclid demonstrated that if ""M"" is a Mersenne prime then ""M""(""M""+1)/2 is a perfect number. In the 18th century, Leonhard Euler proved that all even perfect numbers have this form. No odd perfect numbers are known, and it is suspected that none exist (If it exist, it would have to be greater than 101500)."
"It is currently unknown if there is an infinite number of Mersenne primes. Most mathematicians who have studied the question think there are an infinite number of Mersenne primes. Carl Pomerance, Samuel S. Wagstaff Jr. and Hendrik Lenstra developed a formula which they think should say about how many Mersenne primes there are under a given number."
"The binary representation of 2""n"" - 1 is ""n"" repetitions of the digit 1."
"For example, 2""5"" - 1 = 11111 in binary."
"The first four Mersenne primes were known by the Ancient Greeks. They are 3, 7, 31 and 127. The next, 8191, was discovered in 1456. Some people like trying to find big primes. Since there are tricks and algorithms to finding Mersenne primes quickly, the largest known primes are also Mersenne primes."
"As of December 21, 2018, 51 Mersenne primes have been found. The largest known prime is a Mersenne prime, formula_1."
Super Monkey Ball
"Super Monkey Ball is a platform video game. It was developed by Amusement Vision and published by Sega. It was first released in Japan in January 2001 as an arcade game titled ""Monkey Ball"". It had a joystick in the shape of a banana. It was later released worldwide as a launch title for the Nintendo GameCube. Titled ""Super Monkey Ball"", it was released in Japan on September 4, 2001, in North America on November 18, 2001, and in Europe on May 3, 2002."
Gameplay.
"""Super Monkey Ball"" has three modes of gameplay: Main game, party games and mini-games."
Main game.
"In the main game, the object is to guide a monkey in a hamster ball across a series of platforms in the air and through a goal at the end of the level. Four monkeys are available for the player to play as. Each level is timed; with a level running for either 30 or 60 seconds. The player controls the main game with the GameCube controller's control stick. By moving the stick, the whole level moves, and the ball rolls in the direction that the level moves. Each level has bananas that the player can collect. Bananas give the player points, and collecting a certain amount of them gives the player an extra life. Should the player fall off of the level or the timer reaches zero, the player loses a life. There are three main difficulties: Beginner, Advanced and Expert. Beginner is ten easy levels, Advanced is 30 non-easy levels, and Expert is 50 harder levels. Should the player meet a certain condition after completing a difficulty, they will be able to play the difficulty's ""extra"" levels. A fourth difficulty level, Master, can be unlocked by completing the Expert and Expert Extra levels without using a continue. Master is the hardest difficulty level, with ten levels."
Party games.
"There are three party games: Monkey Race, Monkey Target and Monkey Fight. In Monkey Race, players race on one of several racing levels, competing for the best rank. In Monkey Target, players roll their monkey down a ramp and open the monkey's ball to fly in order to land on one of several islands. Three levels are available to play on. In Monkey Fight, players punch other monkeys for points. When time runs out, whichever monkey has the most points wins."
Mini-games.
"There are three minigames that can to be unlocked with points gotten in the main game: Monkey Bowling, Monkey Billiards and Monkey Golf. Each minigame is based on the real life sport."
Prudence Crandall
"Prudence Crandall (September 3, 1803 – January 28, 1890) was an American teacher. She was born on September 3, 1803 to Quakers. She went to the New England Friends’ Boarding School in Providence, Rhode Island. In October 1831, she opened a private girls’ school in Canterbury, Connecticut. In 1833, an African American girl was admitted to the school. The parents of the white girls in the school wanted the black girl expelled. Crandall refused. She opened a school for African American girls in April 1833."
"The Connecticut legislature passed the ""Black Law"". This law made it illegal to open a school that taught African American pupils from a state other than Connecticut. Crandall was arrested, tried, and convicted of violating this law. She was put in jail. A higher court reversed the decision. Crandall was freed, but neighbors harassed her. They smashed the windows in the school. Crandall feared for the students’ safety. She closed the school in 1834."
"Crandall married Baptist minister and abolitionist Calvin Philleo. In 1835, the couple and his three children left Connecticut for Philleo’s farm in New York State. They later moved to Illinois. Here Crandall ran a school from her home. She also took part in women’s rights activities. When Philleo died in 1874, Prudence moved to Kansas to live with her brother. In 1886, the Connecticut legislature gave her a pension. Crandall died on January 28, 1890. She was buried in Kansas. Her old school house in Canterbury is now the Prudence Crandall Museum. In 1995, Crandall was named Connecticut's state heroine."
Nicko McBrain
"Michael Henry ""Nicko"" McBrain (born 5 June 1952) is an English heavy metal musician. He is the drummer of the heavy metal band Iron Maiden."
"During his early year, McBrain played for a few small pub bands and paid his bills with session work he did when he left school. He has also played in Streetwalkers, Trust and with Pat Travers. He joined Iron Maiden in 1982 and debuted on their fourth studio album, ""Piece of Mind""."
He currently uses Premier drums and Paiste cymbals. He converted to Christianity in 1999 after he had an experience in the Spanish River Church.
Kataklysm
"Kataklysm are a Canadian death metal band from Montreal, Quebec."
"Kataklysm was formed in 1991. The band released their debut studio album ""Sorcery"" on February 10, 1995 and their second full-length album on June 26, 1996. Lead singer Sylvain Houde left the band afterwards and Maurizio Iacono took over the lead vocals. Stephane Barbe was also recruited to the band during this time. Their third album ""Victims of this Fallen World"" which was released on March 7, 1998, saw a change in musical style from Kataklysm's previous albums. They returned to their former style when they released ""The Prophecy (Stigmata of the Immaculate)"" but it was less chaotic and with a little bit of thrash metal."
"The busiest railway station in the world is Shinjuku Station in Tokyo, Japan. The largest station is Nagoya Station in Nagoya, Japan. The busiest station in Europe is Clapham Junction in south London in the United Kingdom. At peak times, there is one train every 13 seconds there."
Station facilities.
"Railway stations usually have either ticket booths, or ticket machines. Ticket sales can also be together with an information desk or a shop. Many stations have a shop or a kiosk."
"Bigger stations often have fast-food or restaurants. In some countries these stations also have a bar, or a pub. Other station facilities are: toilets, luggage rooms, lost-and-found (lost property office), timetables, trolleys, waiting rooms, taxi ranks and bus stops."
Railway track
"A railway track or railway line is a set of two parallel rows of long pieces of steel. They are used by trains to transport people and things from one place to another. (In America, people say railroad as well as railway). Often, there is more than one set of tracks on the railway line. For example, trains go east on one track and west on the other one."
"The rails are supported by cross pieces set at regular intervals (called sleepers or ties), which spread the high pressure load imposed by the train wheels into the ground. They also maintain the rails at a fixed distance apart (called the gauge). Ties are usually made from either wood or concrete. These often rest on ballast, which is a name for very small pieces of broken up rock that are packed together and keep the railway tracks in place. Tracks are often made better by ballast tampers."
"The upper surfaces of the rails are inclined slightly towards each other, typically on a slope of 1/20, and the rims of the train wheels are angled in the same way (""coning""). This helps guide the vehicles of the train along the track. Each wheel also has a flange, which sticks out from one edge all the way around. This makes sure the train does not ""derail"" (come off the track) and helps guide the train on sharp curves."
Rail transport
"Rail transport is the movement of passengers and goods using wheeled vehicles called trains, made to run on railway tracks. In most countries, this transportation method helps trade and economic growth. Railways (UK) or railroads (North America) provide an energy-efficient way to transport material over land. The railway tracks are a large part of the system and provide smooth and hard surfaces on which the wheels of the train roll with a little friction. Also, the track spreads the weight of the train which means larger amounts can be carried than with trucks and roads."
Rail transport started to be important in the Industrial Revolution. The first railroads were built in England.
Waterway
"A waterway is any body of water that can be used for transportation by people in boats. These include rivers, lakes, oceans, and canals."
"They must be wide and deep enough for the boats, and either have no waterfalls and rapids, or have ways for boats to get around them, such as locks."
Terminus
"Terminus is a Latin word that literally means ""Boundary stone"" but can refer to:"
Junction
"A junction is any place where linear things, especially roads and railway tracks, meet."
A Road junction is a place where roads meet. These are known as 'T' junctions and 'X' junctions.
Railway junction.
A railway junction is a place where two railway tracks join. The shape of a junction looks like
Sometimes the trains just cross and keep going straight ahead to their destination. Sometimes they turn onto the other track to reach the planned destination. Moveable portions of track make this possible.
Station
"Station has many meanings, so it is often used with other words to tell people which one is meant:"
In transport:
In communications:
The hottest temperature ever in Mandalay was . The coldest temperature ever was .
Mandalay in writing.
There are some important books and poems that talk about Mandalay. Some of these are famous.
"Rudyard Kipling wrote a poem called ""Mandalay."" He wrote it in 1890. This poem has a famous saying in it: ""on the road to Mandalay."""
"In 1907, Oley Speaks wrote a song using the words of the poem. He called the song ""On the Road to Mandalay."" The song is very famous. Frank Sinatra sang the song and called it ""Come Fly with Me""."
"George Orwell wrote a novel called ""Burmese Days"". He wrote it in 1934. Orwell was part of the Indian Imperial Police. He was stationed in Mandalay. The novel is about his experiences (what he did and saw.) He also wrote some non-fiction essays and short stories. Some of these are ""A Hanging"" (1931) and ""Shooting an Elephant"" (1936)."
Twin towns.
Mandalay has three twin towns:
Act of Congress
"An Act of Congress is a statute enacted by the United States Congress according to the powers granted to it by the Constitution of the United States. The term can be used in other countries with a legislature called a ""Congress,"" such as the Congress of the Philippines. But most often the term is associated with the United States Congress. In the US, there are several steps from a bill or resolution becoming a law. It must first be passed by a majority of both of the houses of Congress. Then the bill or resolution is sent to get signed by the President. It becomes an Act of Congress by either the president's signature or, if the President does not return the bill or resolution within ten days."
Bills.
"Senators and Representatives create thousands of written proposals each year for new laws. Called bills, only a few few ever make it all the way through the process to become a law. The Constitution requires only three steps: passing the House, passing the Senate and approval by the President. The actual process has become much more complicated."
"A bill may be proposed by anyone but only a member of Congress, called the bill's sponsor, may introduce them on the floor of one of the houses of Congress. A bill may be introduced in both the Senate and House at the same time. In theory, this saves time over sending it though one house, then the other. In each house of Congress, a bill is sent to a committee. A committee studies the bill and recommends changes. If a committee does nothing, the bill is considered ""dead"". A committee may also add other unrelated provisions to a bill called amendments. Committees usually divide themselves into smaller groups called subcommittees. The bill's sponsors then try to convince the subcommittees to approve the bill. They do this through hearings. If the bill passes through a committee it is sent to the floor for debate and a vote. A bill may either be passed by be defeated. If passed, it is sent to the other house of Congress to follow the same procedures."
Resolutions.
"In addition to bills, Congress also passes Acts of Congress called resolutions. There are three kinds: simple resolutions, joint resolutions and concurrent resolutions."
Simple resolutions.
"These are resolutions concerning the operation of either house of Congress. They are not sent to the President for his approval. Resolutions by the House of Representatives which affect that house are designated ""H.Res."" followed by a number. Simple resolutions in the Senate are designated ""S. Res."" followed by a number."
Joint resolutions.
"A joint resolution may start either in the House or Senate. They are essentially the same as a bill. The only difference is a joint resolution that proposes an amendment to the US Constitution. They require a two-thirds majority vote in each house. Like a simple resolution, they are not sent to the President for his signature. They become effective when they are ratified by three-quarters of the states. A joint resolution that began in the House of Representatives is designated ""H.J.Res."" followed by the number. A joint resolution started in the Senate is designated ""S.J.Res."", followed by the number. Joint resolutions become law the same as bills."
Concurrent resolutions.
"Concurrent resolutions start with either ""S.Con.Res."" (Senate) or ""H.Con.Res."" (House). They are numbered consecutively as they are introduced. Concurrent resolutions are those that affect the operations of both the House and Senate. They can also be used to create a temporary joint committee. Concurrent resolutions are not sent to the president for his signature and do not have the force of law."
Jeff Weaver (political staffer)
"Jeffrey ""Jeff"" P. Weaver (born 1966) is an American political adviser. He was the campaign manager for the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign in 2016. Weaver served as the campaign manager during Bernie Sanders' successful Senate run in 2006. Weaver also served as chief of staff in Sanders’ House and Senate offices."
"Weaver was born in St. Albans, Vermont. He studied at Boston University, the University of Vermont, and Georgetown University."
Asta Nielsen
"Asta Nielsen (11 September 1881 – 24 May 1972) was a Danish silent movie actress. She was very popular in the 1910s. She was one of the first international movie stars. Nielsen was in 74 movies. 70 were in Germany where she was known simply as ""Die Asta"" (""The Asta""). She had large dark eyes, a face like a mask and a figure like a boy. Nielsen most often played strong and passionate women trapped by tragic lives. Her performances were erotic so Nielsen's movies were heavily censored in the United States. Therefore, she was not very famous there. Nielsen started her own movie studio in Berlin in the 1920s. She went back to Denmark in 1937 after Nazism became a problem. Later in life, Nielsen became a collage artist and an author."
F. Lee Bailey
"Francis Lee Bailey Jr., commonly referred to as F. Lee Bailey, (June 10, 1933 – June 3, 2021) was an American criminal-defense lawyer. Bailey was born in Waltham, Massachusetts. He worked in Massachusetts and Florida."
Individual identity.
"A lifestyle is a way of living or doing things. Lifestyle is doing things, living your life and making decisions in your own unique way. Lifestyle can be political, social, economical and personal way of seeing, doing and understanding things. Not all parts of a lifestyle are our decisions. Surrounding social and technical systems, like economical situation and people around us, can limit the lifestyle choices available to the individual."
The Pallbearer
The Pallbearer is an American romantic comedy released in 1996 directed by Matt Reeves. It stars Toni Collette and Gwyneth Paltrow. The story is about suicide and romance conflict. It received almost $6 million in the box office.
Barbara Bates
"Barbara Bates (August 6, 1925 – March 18, 1969) was an American actress. She acted mostly in movies. She played Phoebe in the 1950 movie ""All about Eve"" and acted in many other movies in her career. She was born in Denver, Colorado. She killed herself with carbon monoxide poisoning, also in Denver. She was age 43."
Seven Bridges of Königsberg
The Seven Bridges of Königsberg is a historically famous problem in mathematics. Leonhard Euler solved the problem in 1735. This led to the beginning of graph theory. This then led to the development of topology.
"The city of Königsberg in Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia) was set on both sides of the Pregel River. It included two large islands which were connected to each other and the mainland by seven bridges."
The problem was to find a way to walk through the city by crossing each bridge once and only once. The islands could not be reached by any route other than the bridges. Every bridge must have been crossed completely every time. The walk need not start and end at the same spot. Euler proved that the problem has no solution.
Euler's analysis.
"First, Euler pointed out that the choice of route inside each land mass does not matter. The only important property of a route is the order in which the bridges are crossed. So, he changed the problem to abstract terms. This laid the foundations of graph theory. He removed all features except the list of land masses and the bridges connecting them. In the language of graph theory, he replaced each land mass with an abstract ""vertex"" or node. Then he replaced each bridge with an abstract connection, an ""edge"". An edge (road) recorded which two vertices (land masses) were connected. In this way, he formed a graph."
→
"The graph drawn is an abstract picture of the problem. So, the edges can be joined in any way. Only whether two points are connected or not are important. Changing the picture of the graph does not change the graph itself."
"Next, Euler observed that (except at the endpoints of the walk), whenever one enters a vertex by a bridge, one leaves the vertex by a bridge. In any walk of the graph, the number of times one enters a vertex equals the number of times one leaves it. If every bridge has been crossed exactly once, it follows that, for each land mass (except for the ones chosen for the start and finish), the number of bridges touching that land mass must be ""even"". This is because if there are n bridges, it is crossed exactly 2n times. However, all four of the land masses in the original problem are touched by an ""odd"" number of bridges (one is touched by 5 bridges, and each of the other three are touched by 3). There are at most two masses which can be the endpoints of a walk. So the proposition of a walk crossing each bridge once leads to a contradiction."
"In modern language, Euler shows that whether a walk through a graph crossing each edge once is possible or not depends on the degrees of the nodes. The degree of a node is the number of edges touching it. Euler shows that a necessary condition for the walk is that the graph be connected and have exactly zero or two nodes of odd degree. This result stated by Euler was later proved by Carl Hierholzer. Such a walk is now called an ""Eulerian path"" or ""Euler walk"". If there are nodes of odd degree, then any Eulerian path will start at one of them and end at the other. Since the graph representing the historical Königsberg has four nodes of odd degree, it cannot have an Eulerian path."
"Euler's work was presented to the St. Petersburg Academy on August 26, 1735. It was published as ""Solutio problematis ad geometriam situs pertinentis"" (The solution of a problem relating to the geometry of position) in the journal ""Commentarii academiae scientiarum Petropolitanae"" in 1741. It is available in English in The World of Mathematics."
Importance in the history of mathematics.
"In the history of mathematics, Euler's solution of the Königsberg bridge problem is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory. Graph Theory is a subject now generally regarded as a branch of combinatorics."
Present state of the bridges.
"Two of the seven original bridges were destroyed during the bombing of Königsberg in World War II. Two others were later demolished. They were replaced by a modern highway. The three other bridges remain, although only two of them are from Euler's time (one was rebuilt in 1935). Thus, as of 2000, there were five bridges in Kaliningrad."
"In terms of graph theory, two of the nodes now have degree 2, and the other two have degree 3. Therefore, an Eulerian path is now possible, but since it must begin on one island and end on the other, it is impractical for tourists."
The Heat
The Heat is a 2013 police comedy which stars Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy. Bullock plays a Special Agent and the latter plays a detective. This comedy is set in Boston.
San (river)
San is a river in southeastern Poland. It is 443.3 km long.
"His son Brian and daughter Lisa are the co-chairs and co-CEOs of the company. His daughter Cheryl is the president of the foundation. Steve Whitmire, a veteran member of the Muppet puppeteering crew, plays the roles of Kermit the Frog and Ernie, the most famous characters formerly played by Jim Henson."
"One of Henson's last projects is a show attraction in Walt Disney World and Disneyland. It is called Muppet*Vision 3D. It opened in 1991, shortly after his death."
Game Boy Advance Video
"Game Boy Advance Video is a format of cartridges for the Game Boy Advance. They work the same as normal cartridge but play television shows instead of games. They generally contain 45 minutes of TV, for example, a show from Nickelodeon or Cartoon Network. They were first made in early 2004, but gradually stopped being made shortly before there were no more Game Boy Advance games made in 2008, with the final game for it being Samurai Deeper KYO."
Butterfly
"A butterfly is a usually day-flying insect of the order Lepidoptera. They are grouped together in the suborder Rhopalocera. Butterflies are closely related to moths, from which they evolved. The earliest discovered fossil moth dates to 200 million years ago."
"The life of butterflies is closely connected to flowering plants, which their larvae (caterpillars) feed on, and their adults feed and lay their eggs on. They have a long-lasting history of co-evolution with flowering plants. Many of the details of plant anatomy are related to their pollinators, and vice versa. The other notable features of butterflies are their extraordinary range of colours and patterns, and their wings. These are discussed below."
"Angiosperms (flowering plants) evolved in the Lower Cretaceous, but did not become common until the Upper Cretaceous. Butterflies were the last major group of insects to appear on the planet. They evolved from moths in the latest Cretaceous or the earliest Cainozoic. The earliest known butterfly fossils date to the mid Eocene epoch, between 40 and 50 million years ago."
"Like moths, butterflies have four wings covered with tiny scales. When a butterfly is not flying, its wings are usually folded over its back. The wings are patterned and are often brightly coloured. There are many different kinds of butterflies. The males and females of each kind are often slightly different from each other. Butterfly watching is a popular hobby. Some people also keep collections of dead butterflies that they have caught."
"Like all insects with complete metamorphosis, a butterfly's life goes through four distinct stages. It begins as an egg, which hatches into a larva (a caterpillar). After some time, the larva turns into a chrysalis. While it is in the chrysalis stage, it changes to become an adult butterfly. To complete the cycle, adults mate and the females lay the eggs."
"Butterflies are any of the species belonging to the superfamilies Papilionoidea and Hedyloidea. Butterflies, along with the moths and the skippers, make up the insect order Lepidoptera. Butterflies are nearly worldwide in their distribution."
Predators and defences.
Predators.
"The main predators of butterflies are birds, just as the main predators of the crepuscular moths are bats. Also monkeys and tree-dwelling reptiles are predators, and some insects and spiders. All reptiles and monkeys have good colour vision, so that butterfly coloration works just as well on them as it does on birds."
Defences.
The extraordinary colours and patterns on the wings and body can only be understood in terms of their function. Some of the most obvious functions of colour are:
"The details vary from group to group, and from species to species. The caterpillars also have colours with similar functions. The poisonous substances which make some butterflies noxious to eat are got from the plants eaten by their caterpillars."
Body.
"Like most insects, butterflies have three main body parts. These parts are the head, the thorax, and the abdomen. The body is protected by the exoskeleton. The body is made up of sections, known as segments. In between the segments there are flexible areas that allow the butterfly to move. All three parts of the body are covered in very small scales. The scales give the butterfly its colour."
Wings and flight.
Butterflies have a very characteristic flying style. They usually do not fly in straight lines. Their style is well described by the children's version of their name: 'flutter-by'. The way they fly presumably makes them harder for birds to catch.
"Some species are capable of strong, long flights (see monarch butterfly migration) and others never leave the woods they were born in. They can survive bird pecks on the wings. Late in the season damage to their wings can often be seen, though they continue flying quite well."
"When they are alive, it is often difficult to see they have four wings. The wings on each side are linked by a row of little hooks. So in practice they fly as if they had one large wing on each side."
Head.
"The head is the first part of the body. It has the eyes, mouth parts, and antennae."
"The eyes of a butterfly are large. Like other adult insects, the eye is made up of many small lenses or ""optical units"". these are compound eyes. Butterflies do not see as many colours as humans, but they can see ultraviolet light."
"The mouth of an adult butterfly does not have jaws. It has a kind of mouth that sucks liquids. This mouth is made of two hollow tubes. The tubes are locked together in the middle. When the butterfly is not drinking, the tubes are coiled up. It can uncoil them when it wants to drink. Like all insects, the adult phase is about reproduction. The main eating phase is done by the larvae, which usually eat plant food."
"The antennae of a butterfly are used for smell and balance. The antenna in most butterflies is clubbed at the end. In some butterflies (like the skippers), there is a hook at the end of the antenna, instead of a club."
Thorax.
The thorax is the second part of the body. It is made up of three segments. The legs and wings are connected to the thorax.
Brittle star
"Brittle stars are Echinoderms of the Class Ophiuroidea. The adults are superficially like starfish, but they are a different group, with different larvae. Like other echinoderms, they do have a skeleton of calcareous plates, and radial symmetry. There are about 1500 different species."
"Usually they have 5 ""arms"", which can grow long, up to 60 cm, in the largest species. The central disk of brittle stars can be three to eight inches in diameter. Unlike starfish, they live deeper in the ocean. Ophiuroids are known even from abyssal (&gt;6000 m) depths. However, brittle stars are also common members of reef communities, where they hide under rocks and even within other living organisms. Generally, brittle stars live below 500m of depth."
"There are two related groups of Ophiuroids: the ""Ophiurida"" (brittle stars) and the basket stars (""Eurialida""). Basket stars usually live in the deeper parts of the range. Brittle stars are mostly scavengers and detrivores, able to catch some small prey on occasion."
Description.
"Many brittle stars are more fragile than starfish, which is how they got their name. When they are picked up, their arms may fall off. This might make the animal seem brittle, but they often do this as a defense to escape from predators."
Movement.
"Brittle stars do not use their tube feet for movement, but instead use muscles in their long, thin arms to go around rocks. Ophiurids move quickly when disturbed, and are faster movers than starfish. In living ophiuroids the plates are linked by longitudinal muscles. Ophiurid arms only move horizontally. The way their plates interlock prevents the arms from moving in any other plane.p64 In contrast, basket star arms can move vertically. These movement patterns are distinct, and separate the groups."
"Ophiuroids in general are mostly scavengers or detritivores. Small organic particles are moved into the mouth by the tube feet. Ophiuroids may also prey on small crustaceans or worms. Brittle stars will eat small suspended organisms if available. In large, crowded areas, brittle stars eat suspended matter from prevailing seafloor currents."
Basket stars.
"Basket stars (Euryalids) are large brittle stars with many rays. Their arms branch, and can be moved in any direction. This distinguishes them from the Ophiurids. Basket stars may be capable of suspension feeding, using the mucus coating on their arms to trap plankton and bacteria. They extend one arm out and use the other four as anchors. The arms form so many branches that they are almost feathery on the ends. They get their name because when they stretch their rays out to catch plankton, they look like the bottom of a basket."
"Basket stars can be large and heavy, the biggest Ophiuroids. The largest, ""Gorgonocephalus stimpsoni"", weigh up to 5 kg (11 lbs) and has arms 70cms long, with a disk diameter of 14 cm."
Bivalve
"The bivalves are a large class of molluscs, also known as pelecypods."
They have a hard calcareous shell made of two parts or 'valves'. The soft parts are inside the shell. The shell is usually bilaterally symmetrical.
"There are over 30,000 species of bivalves, including the fossil species. There are about 9,200 living species in 1,260 genera and 106 families. All of them live in the water, most of them in the sea or in brackish water. Some live in fresh water. All are filter feeders: they lost their radula in the course of evolution. A few are carnivorous, eating much larger prey than the tiny microalgae eaten by other bivalves."
"The best known examples of bivalves are clams, mussels, scallops and oysters."
Shell.
"Bivalves have two shells or valves connected by a hinge with hinge teeth. They are made of a calcareous mineral, calcite or aragonite. The valves are covered by a periostracum, which is an organic horny substance. This forms the familiar coloured layer on the shell."
The shells are usually held shut by strong adductor muscles. Scallops can use their muscles to flap the valves and swim.
Food.
A bivalve takes in water that has plankton and other things floating in it.
"Some (but not all) molluscs have a part of their mantle known as the siphon (a tube). Siphons, if they exist, come in pairs, one to suck in, one to expel."
"Anything that is small enough to fit inside the hole of its incurrent siphon enters the bivalve. When the floating material comes in, it gets stuck in slimy mucus that is on the surface of the bivalve's gills. The food is moved down to the mouth, which is on the other side of the siphon. Food is digested in the bivalve's stomach and intestine, and everything that is not digested goes out through the other siphon, with water."
"The siphons are an adaptation of burrowing molluscs. Those that live above the substrate (sediment), such as scallops and oysters, do not need them."
Feeding types.
"There are four feeding types, defined by their gill structure:"
Movement.
Digging.
"As a group, the bivalves are adapted to penetrate into, and to move along horizontally along, soft ground such as mud and sand. Common examples of this are razor shells, which can dig themselves into the sand with great speed to escape enemies, and cockles."
Swimming.
"The Separatists decided to leave England for the Dutch Republic (where religious freedom was permitted). William Bradford went with them. It was illegal to leave England. The group was betrayed by an English sea captain who brought them to the English authorities. Most of the congregation, and Bradford, were put into prison. By the summer of 1608, the Separatists, and William Bradford, escaped to Leiden, Netherlands. Bradford was 18."
In the Dutch Republic.
"William Bradford moved to Amsterdam in August 1608. He lived with the Brewsters in Stink Alley. The Separatists had spent most of their money leaving England and were poor. After nine months, the congregation moved to the smaller city of Leiden."
When Bradford turned 21 he received some money. Bradford purchased his own house. He built a workshop and worked as a weaver. He was liked.
"In 1613, Bradford married Dorothy May, the daughter of a rich English couple living in Amsterdam. In 1617, the Bradfords had their first child, John Bradford."
"By 1617, the Separatists decided to travel to Virginia Colony in North America. The Separatists could practice their religion in the Dutch Republic, they wanted their children to keep their English customs and language. The colonists made a business arrangement with the Merchant Adventurers. These were a group of men who were willing to pay for the Pilgrims to go to the New World with the promise that the pilgrims would pay them back with furs and other goods they got from the colony. By July 1620, Robert Cushman and John Carver had made the plans and fifty Separatists left Delftshaven on the ship ""Speedwell""."
"Many families were split as some Separatists stayed behind in the Netherlands, planning to make the voyage to the New World after the colony had been established. William and Dorothy Bradford left their three-year-old son John with Dorothy's parents in Amsterdam, possibly because he was too frail to make the voyage."
Departure.
"The ""Speedwell"" planned to meet with the ""Mayflower"" and both ships would travel to Virginia Colony. The ""Speedwell"" proved unsafe and the passengers were put on the ""Mayflower"". This made the ship very crowded. Not all the passengers were Separatists. There were about 50 colonists who went because they had certain skills. These skills would prove useful on the ""Mayflower"" and at the colony. Bradford said they hugged each other and cried and said goodbye to family and friends for the last time. They knew they were pilgrims and lifted their eyes to heaven, their dearest country and this comforted them."
The Mayflower Voyage.
"The Mayflower left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. There were 102 passengers and 30–40 crew. On 19 November 1620, the ""Mayflower"" spotted land. The ""Mayflower"" was supposed to land in Virginia Colony, but the ship was too damaged and they were forced to land at Cape Cod now called Provincetown Harbor."
"They landed on November 21. They wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other. Bradford signed the Mayflower Compact."
Anchored and first explorations at Plymouth Colony.
"Up to this time, Bradford, aged 30, had never been a leader in the colony. When the ""Mayflower"" anchored in the Harbor, the men went out to explore the land for a place where they could live. Bradford volunteered to be a member of the exploration parties. In November and December, these parties went out three times on foot and by boat."
"One of the earliest exploration missions included William Bradford, John Carver, Myles Standish, Edward Winslow, John Howland, Richard Warren, Stephen Hopkins and Edward Doty. Of this group Hopkins was the most experienced, having seen Indians during his time at Jamestown. According to Bradford, they set off in below freezing weather, many of the men already being ill, ""and when the set sail the salt spray froze on their coats, as if they had been glazed"". During their trip they saw Indians who looked like they were cutting up a large whale. When the Indians saw the men they ran away. The men camped and protected themselves from the cold and the Indians."
"They located a place that would be Plymouth Colony in December. During the first expedition on foot, Bradford was caught up in a deer trap made by Native Americans and brought upside down. During the third exploration, on 6 December 1620, Bradford and the other men found Plymouth Bay. A winter storm nearly sank their boat as they came near the bay. The explorers were very cold and started to get sick. The waves were high but they landed on Clark's Island."
"During this time, they searched areas all around the bay and found a place to live and build their homes. The location had a large hill. This hill is now called Burial Hill. It was a good place to build a fort for safety against any possible enemies. There were many brooks providing water. They would later find out that the site had been the location of a Native American village known as Patuxet; and that is why a large area had already been cleared for planting of food. The Patuxet tribe of Indians, between 1616 and 1619, had all died from bad sickness. Bradford later wrote that bones of the dead were easy to find in many places."
Plymouth Colony.
Great sickness.
"The ""Mayflower"" arrived in Plymouth Bay on 20 December 1620. The settlers began building the colony's first house on 25 December."
"On January 11, 1621, as Bradford was helping to build houses when he was got a great pain in his hipbone and fell. Bradford was taken to the ""common house"" (the only house that was finished) and they thought he would die that night, but he did not."
"Bradford got well but many of the pilgrims were not so fortunate. During the months of February and March 1621 sometimes two or three people died every day. By the end of the winter, half of the 100 settlers had died. They buried their dead in secret so the Native Americans would not see how many were dying. They buried them in Cole's Hill and tried to also hide the graves from the animals."
"There were only a small number of men who were healthy. Everyone, including the children had to work and care for the sick. One of these was Captain Myles Standish. He was a soldier who had been hired by the settlers to protect the people of the colony. Standish cared for Bradford during his illness. They became good friends. Bradford had no military experience and when he became governor he would come to trust Captain Standish's advice on military matters."
William was chosen by the people to be Governor of Plymouth Colony. He kept journals (a written record) which are very important even today because they are the only history of how the Mayflower passengers and their families lived in Plymouth Colony. He died before he could finish the second book.
Early service as governor.
"On March 16, the settlers had their first meeting with the Native Americans who lived in the region. Samoset, an Indian walked into the village of Plymouth and greeted them in English. Samoset had learned some English from the traders who had visited the area he was from. This soon led to a visit by Massasoit, the leader of the Pokanoket tribe. At that meeting, Massassoit made a treaty with Governor John Carver. The treaty said that they would be friends and protect each other against unfriendly Indians."
Bradford wrote down what was said. He would soon become governor and the treaty that was very important was the promise to help each other. This agreement was not liked by Massasoit's enemies in other tribes.
"In April 1621, Governor Carver became sick while working in the fields on a hot day. He died a few days later. The settlers of Plymouth then chose Bradford as the new governor. Bradford would remain governor most of his life."
"The elected leadership of Plymouth Colony was at first a governor and an assistant governor. The assistant governor for the first three years of the colony's history was Isaac Allerton. In 1624, it was changed to five assistants. This was called the ""governor's council"". These men gave advice to the governor and had a vote on important matters. They helped Bradford in managing the Colony. Assistants during the early years of the colony included Thomas Prence, Stephen Hopkins, John Alden, and John Howland."
Family.
"William Bradford married Dorothy in Amsterdam, Holland on December 10, 1613. They had one son. Dorothy fell from the deck of the Mayflower into the water and drowned a short time after the ship landed. Her husband was on an exploring mission. John was born in Leiden, Holland and died in 1620."
His second wife was Alice Southwarth in Plymouth. They had three children. She died in Plymouth in March 1670 and was buried on Burial Hill in Plymouth near her husband.
"The Indian Ocean is the ocean surrounded by Asia to the north, Australia and the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Southern Ocean to the south, and Africa and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. It is named for the river Indus and Ancient India on its north shore. The Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea, the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea are all parts of this ocean."
"The deepest point in the Indian Ocean is in the Java Trench near the Sunda Islands in the east, 7500 m (25,344 feet) deep. The average depth is 3,890 m (12,762 ft). The Indian Ocean is the third largest ocean, 28,350,000 square miles in size. The majority is in the southern hemisphere."
Arctic Ocean
"The Arctic Ocean is the ocean around the North Pole. The most northern parts of Eurasia and North America are around the Arctic Ocean. Thick pack ice and snow cover almost all of this ocean in winter, and most of it in summer. An icebreaker or a nuclear-powered submarine can use the Northwest Passage through the Arctic Ocean to go between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans."
"The ocean's area is about 14.056 million km2, which is the smallest of the world's 5 oceans, and it has of coastline. The central surface covered by ice about thick. The biology there is quite special. Endangered species there include walruses, whales and polar bears. Year by year the Arctic Ocean is becoming less icy, as a result of global warming."
"The average depth of the Arctic Ocean is . The deepest point is in the Eurasian Basin, at ."
Geography.
"The Arctic Ocean covers an area of about 14,056,000 km2. The coastline is 45,390 km (28,200 mi) long It is surrounded by Eurasia, North America, Greenland, and by several islands."
"It is generally taken to include Baffin Bay, Barents Sea, Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea, East Siberian Sea, Greenland Sea, Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Kara Sea, Laptev Sea, White Sea and other bodies of water. It is connected to the Pacific Ocean by the Bering Strait and to the Atlantic Ocean through the Greenland Sea and Labrador Sea."
"Countries bordering the Arctic Ocean are: Russia, Norway, Iceland, Greenland, Canada and the United States."
Climate.
"The Arctic Ocean is in a polar climate. Winters are characterized by the polar night, cold and stable weather conditions, and clear skies."
"The temperature of the surface of the Arctic Ocean is fairly constant, near the freezing point of seawater. Arctic Ocean consists of saltwater but its salinity is less than other oceans. The temperature must reach −1.8 °C (28.8 °F) before freezing occurs."
Ice covers most of the Arctic Ocean. It covers almost the whole ocean in late winter and the majority of the ocean in late summer. Much of the Arctic ice pack is covered in snow for about 10 months of the year. The maximum snow cover is in March or April — about 20 to 50 cm (7.9 to 19.7 in).
"The climate of the Arctic region has varied significantly in the past. As recently as 55 million years ago, during the eocene epoch, the region reached an average annual temperature of 10–20 °C (50–68 °F). The surface waters of the Arctic Ocean warmed enough to support tropical lifeforms."
Animal and plant life.
Endangered marine species in the Arctic Ocean include walruses and whales. The area has a fragile ecosystem. The Arctic Ocean has relatively little plant life except for phytoplankton. Phytoplankton are a crucial part of the ocean. They feed on nutrients from rivers and the currents of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
Inuit
"The Inuit are one of many groups of First Nations who live in very cold places of northern Canada, Greenland, the Arctic, and Alaska."
"They are sometimes called ""Eskimos"", a word which likely comes from the Algonquin language and may mean ""eater of raw meat"" which is a fallacy many believe due to misinformation. The term Eskimo means ""netter of snowshoes. Most Inuit prefer to be called by their own name, either the more general Inuit particularly in Canada or their actual tribe name. Inuit is a tribe name but not all indigenous Arctic peoples in North America are Inuits. Particularly in the United States Alaska, the word Eskimo would be accepted as a more general term, but would probably refer to themselves by their tribe name."
Etymology.
"Inuit in Canada and Greenland like the name ""Inuit"" because it is their own name for themselves. ""Inuit"" means more than one, one person is an ""Inuk"". The native Greenlanders are related to the Inuit. The language of the Inuit is Inuktitut, and it is one of the official languages of Nunavut and of the Northwest Territories in Canada. Eskimo is a term more frequently used in mainstream United States where such concerns get less attention."
"Inuits in Alaska have various concerns, such as protecting the caribou from American oil pipelines. Anti-seal hunt campaigns work to eliminate this aspect of northern culture, which most Inuits regard as vital to their lives."
Traditional culture.
"Inuit ate both raw and cooked meat and fish, as well as the fetus's of pregnant animals. Whale blubber was burned as fuel for cooking and lamps."
"Inuit were also Nomadic people, but they did not domesticate any animals except for dogs, which they used to pull their sleds and help with the hunting. They were hunter-gatherers, living off the land. They were very careful to make good use of every part of the animals they killed. Respect for the land and the animals they harvested was and is a focal part of their culture."
"Inuit lived in tents made of animal skins during the summer. In the winter they lived in sod houses and igloos. They could build an igloo out of snow bricks in just a couple of hours. Snow is full of air spaces, which helps it hold in warmth. With just a blubber lamp for heat, an igloo could be warmer than the air outside. The Inuit made very clever things from the bones, antlers, and wood they had. They invented the harpoon, which was used to hunt seals and whales. They built boats from wood or bone covered with animal skins. They invented the ""kayak"" for one man to use for hunting the ocean and among the pack ice."
"Inuit sleds could be built from wood, bone, or even animal skins wrapped around frozen fish. Dishes were made from carving soapstone, bones, or musk ox horns. They wore two layers of skins, one fur side in, the other facing out, to stay warm."
"Inuit had to be good hunters to survive. When an animal was killed in a hunt, it was thanked respectfully for offering itself to the hunter. They believed it intended to provide itself as a gift towards the survival of the hunter and his children. Their gratitude was deeply sincere and is an important aspect of their belief system. In the winter, seals did not come out onto the ice. They only came up for air at holes they chewed in the ice. Inuit would use their dogs to find the air holes, then wait patiently until the seal came back to breathe and kill it with a harpoon. In the summer, the seals would lie out on the ice enjoying the sun. The hunter would have to slowly creep up on a seal to kill it. The Inuit would use their dogs and spears to hunt polar bears, musk ox, and caribou. Sometimes they would kill caribou from their boats as the animals crossed the rivers on their migration."
"The Inuit even hunted whales. From their boat, they would throw harpoons that were attached to floats made of inflated seal skins. The whale would grow tired from dragging the floats under the water. When it slowed down and came up to the surface, the Inuit could keep hitting it with more harpoons or spears until it died. Whale blubber provide Vitamin D and Omegas to their cultural diet, and prevented rickets. The whaling industry around the world has depleted the whale population, and now traditional whale hunting for subsistence purposes is rare around the world. Inuits have added to their modern northern diet with grocery foods, which are normally very expensive in the north."
"The lateral line detects changes in water pressure. It is open to the environment by a line of pores. This and the sound-detecting organs are grouped together as the 'acoustico-lateralis system', because they have a common origin. In bony fish and tetrapods the external opening into the inner ear has been lost."
This system is found in other fish as well. It detects motion or vibrations in water. The shark can sense frequencies in the range of 25 to 50 Hz.
Reproduction.
"About 70% of all known shark species give birth to live young, with the gestation period lasting from 6 to 22 months."
"Pups are born with a full set of teeth, and are capable of taking care of themselves. Once born, they quickly swim away from their mothers, who sometimes feed on the pups. Litters vary from one or two pups (great white shark) to one hundred pups (blue shark and whale shark)."
"Some sharks are oviparous, laying their eggs in the water. Shark eggs (sometimes called ""mermaid's purses"") are covered by a tough, leathery membrane."
"Most sharks are ovoviviparous, meaning the eggs hatch inside the female's body, with the babies developing within the mother, but there is no placenta to nourish the pups. Instead the young feed on the egg's yolk. The pups eat any unfertilized eggs and sometimes each other. Very few pups in a litter survive until birth due to this form of sibling cannibalism. Great white sharks, mako sharks, nurse sharks, tiger sharks, and sand tiger sharks give birth this way."
"Some sharks are viviparous, meaning that the females give live birth: the eggs hatch inside the female's body, and the babies are fed by a placenta. The placenta helps transfer nutrients and oxygen from the mother's bloodstream and transfers waste products from the baby to the mother for elimination. Examples of viviparous sharks include the bull sharks, the whitetip reef sharks, the lemon sharks, the blue sharks, the silvertip sharks, and the hammerhead sharks. Although long thought to be oviparous, whale sharks are viviparous, and pregnant females have been found containing hundreds of pups."
New shark discoveries.
"New sharks are still being found. Dave Ebert found ten new species in a Taiwan market. Over the past three decades he has named 24 new species. They include sharks, rays, sawfish and ghost sharks these cartilaginous fish are all related."
Fishing.
"Some sharks are not endangered, but some are hunted for food (like shark fin soup) or sport fishing. In 2013 five species of shark, along with two species of manta ray, received international protection as part of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species."
"It is thought that 100 million sharks are killed by commercial and recreational fishing. Sharks are a common seafood in many places, including Japan and Australia. In the Australian state of Victoria, shark is the most commonly used fish in fish and chips, in which fillets are battered and deep-fried or crumbed and grilled. In fish and chip shops, shark is called ""flake"". In India, small sharks or baby sharks (called ""sora"" in Tamil and Telugu languages) are sold in local markets. Since the flesh is not matured (not adult), cooking the flesh breaks it into powder. The powder is then fried in oil and spices (called sora puttu/sora poratu). The soft bones can be easily chewed. They are considered a delicacy in coastal Tamil Nadu."
Vulture
Vultures are large birds of prey that usually feed on the carrion or (dead or dying animals and rocks). Vultures use their large wings to soar in the air for many miles without having to flap. Vultures are also called buzzards.
"""Vultures"" from the Old World (Europe, Asia, and Africa) are not related to the vultures of the New World (North and South America). They look quite similar, though. Both have heads and necks with no feathers."
"""Old World vultures"" are related to eagles and hawks and use sight to find their food. ""New World vultures"" are related to storks and use their sense of smell to find their food. Vultures symbolize death in literature."
"King vultures use rocks to open eggs, they pick up a rock with their beak and simply drop or throw the rock onto the egg and breaks it."
New World vultures is a name which is used for a number of species in the Americas. The best known of these are probably the Andean condor and the black vulture.
Eagle
"Eagle is a general term for many large birds of prey. Over 60 species have been described, and they live in many parts of the world. Most species of eagle are found in Eurasia and in Africa."
"Eagles are not a natural monophyletic group. The name describes a bird of prey big enough to hunt larger vertebrates. Eagles hunt during the day and have very good eyesight. Eagles are generally put in the family Accipitridae. They belong to several groups of genera, some of which are closely related."
"The largest eagle that has ever lived is Haast's eagle. It is the only eagle in the world ever to have been top predator of its ecosystem. Though it is now extinct, it lived in New Zealand. Before man got there, it preyed on moas."
"Eagles are carnivores. This means that they eat meat from other animals. Eagles are birds of prey, and so are vultures, falcons and owls. Eagles use their strong talons to catch and grab their food, and they use their sharp beaks to help them tear into the meat of their prey."
Falcon
"Falcons are small to medium-sized birds of prey related to hawks, eagles, and vultures. They usually have pointed wings and long tails."
"Most falcons eat small mammals. Some species hunt other birds, which they take in flight. Like hawks, most falcons have dark gray or brown backs and wings, with white undersides."
"The peregrine falcon is found over most of the world and is famous for hunting birds by diving down on them at 320 km/h (200 mi/h). It was nearly wiped out in North America by the use of pesticides, but has since made a recovery."
In some countries falcons are used in falconry. This means people catch the birds and make them hunt for them. Long ago this was a way for people to get more food but today it is a sport.
"Dump trucks (""tippers"" in the UK) carry sand, gravel, and dirt. Most dump trucks have an open-top box bed with an opening ""tail-gate"" door on the back. The body lifts up at the front. The load falls out the tailgate and is ""dumped"" on the ground behind the truck."
Flatbed trucks have a flat body with no sides. There is a wall between the cab and the body. The load will not move forward and hit the cab. The truck can be loaded from the side or top. Nothing covers the load. Some trucks have sides that can be taken off or folded down. Many times the load is covered with tarps.
Garbage trucks pick up garbage and trash from homes and some businesses. Most were loaded from the rear. Now some load from the front or side. The same type of truck is often used for recycling.
"Semi-tractors (""artics"" in the UK) have no bodies. They have a ""fifth wheel"" that carries weight. A semi-trailer has no front wheels. The front of the trailer goes on the fifth wheel. The semi-tractor carries weight from the trailer and pulls the trailer"
"Tank trucks (""tankers"" in the UK) are designed to carry liquids or gases. They usually have a round tank that is long (a cylinder) lying on its side. There are many types of tanks because there are many liquids and gases. Most tankers are built for only one liquid."
"Boom Truck is a truck with a hydraulic arm. The hydraulic arm on a boom truck is called the boom. This boom will reach out past the end of the vehicle, and it will grab the vehicles that need to be towed. The boom of the truck remains in a fixed position, which allows it to be a very stable option when it comes to towing."
"Wreckers (""recovery lorries"" in the UK and sometimes ""tow trucks"" in the US) are used to lift and tow broken cars and trucks. They usually have a boom with a cable. Cars are often carried on special flatbeds."
Crown-of-thorns starfish
"The crown-of-thorns starfish (""Acanthaster planci"") is a type of sea star. Usually, they have orange-red to purplish skin, with yellow or pink spikes on their skin. The crown-of-thorns is also one of the largest starfish in the world, as it has a diameter of up to 3 feet. The crown-of-thorns lives in the warmer areas of the Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, and Red Sea."
"It only feeds on coral polyps, and usually at night. The crown-of-thorns climbs over its prey, releases digestive enzymes to break down its food, and then absorbs the coral polyp, which has now turned into a liquid. What's left behind by the sea star is the leftover coral skeleton."
"They are usually of subdued colours, pale brown to grey-green, but they may be garish with bright warning colours in some parts of their wide range. These bright colours warn animals that may want to eat it that it is venomous."
Effect on coral reefs.
"The crown-of-thorns is well known for its destructive habits of eating coral, especially on the Great Barrier Reef, which is a World Heritage Site. Usually, when there are not too many of them, these sea stars help maintain the coral reef by preventing the faster-growing coral from taking over the coral reef. However, when there are too many crown-of-thorns, they can devastate the reef."
Sea urchin
"Sea urchins are the Class Echinoidea of the Phylum Echinodermata. Like the rest of the Echinoderms, literally ""spike-skinned"", they are entirely marine. They are usually globe-shaped, and protected by calcareous plates and spines.p65 ""Urchin"" is an old word for hedgehog, and in many foreign languages these animals are called ""sea hedgehogs""."
"Like other echinoderms they have five-fold symmetry (called pentamerism) and move by means of hundreds of tiny, transparent, adhesive 'tube feet'. The symmetry is not obvious in the living animal, but is easily visible in the dried test."
"Sea urchins mostly feed on algae and small animals. They have a special chewing apparatus called ""Aristotle's lantern"", after the Greek philosopher Aristotle who was fascinated by sea urchins. With this apparatus they can scrape organisms stuck to the surface over which the urchin is moving."
Spines.
"The spines are long and sharp in some species, and protect the urchin from predators. The spines inflict a painful wound when they penetrate human skin, but are usually not dangerous. Echinoids also have pincer-like pedicellaria all over their body between the spines. The job of these is to deal with anything (like larvae) settling on the test (outer shell).p101 It is not known if the spines are venomous (unlike the pedicellariae between the spines, which are venomous)."
"Typical sea urchins have spines that are in length, thick, and not terribly sharp. ""Diadema antillarum"", familiar in the Caribbean, has thin, potentially dangerous spines that can reach long."
Teeth.
Sea urchins have five jaws with one tooth each. The teeth grow throughout the sea urchin's life. The teeth of the pink sea urchin chip against each other to stay sharp.
Ecology.
"Sea urchins feed mainly on algae, but can also feed on sea cucumbers, and a wide range of invertebrates such as mussels, polychaetes, sponges, brittle stars and crinoids. Sea urchins are one of the favorite foods of sea otters and wolf eels. Without predators to eat them, urchins breed in large numbers and eat almost all the nearby kelp, creating an ""urchin barren"", devoid of macroalgae and associated fauna. Sea otters have re-entered British Columbia, dramatically improving coastal ecosystem health by eating sea urchins."
Fossil record and evolution.
"The first echinoid fossils are from the Lower Ordovician period. The earliest forms had flexible tests, with plates that could slide over each other. Echinoids were a relatively unimportant part of the biota in the Palaeozoic. Only one group survived the P/Tr extinction event to form the basis of all later echinoids. The group which survived into the Triassic, the Cidaroids, radiated into all other modern groups, which are known as the Euechinoids."
"The break with perfect symmetry, which happened in the Jurassic, gave them definite front and back ends. This opened up new habitats, in particular, the burrowing habitat. Sand dollars and heart urchins have been highly successful. The living echinoids are now important members of the biota, especially in shallow and in-shore waters."
Sea urchins as food.
"Some humans eat the reproductive organs of sea urchins (which they call roe). This is popular in Korea. In Japan, this kind of sushi is called ""uni""."
Beer
"Beer is a type of alcoholic drink. It is made with water, hops, barley (types of cereal grains), and types of yeast (a fungus that produces alcohol). A process called fermentation turns sugar into alcohol, using yeast. Another product of the fermentation is carbon dioxide."
Classification from the type of fermentation.
"In general, all alcoholic drinks where yeast turns sugar into alcohol are called ""beer"". In these cases, distillation is not used. The difference to wine is that with wine, sugars from plants, such as fruit sugar, or that made by animals is used. As an example, mead is a wine made from honey. Japanese sake is made from rice, and uses yeast for fermentation; so even if some people call it ""rice wine"", sake is really a kind of beer."
Making beer.
"The act of making beer is called ""brewing"". Beer is made by adding warm water to malted barley and other grains. The enzymes in the barley change the malted barley and other grains into simple sugars. This is called the mash. The water is then sparged (drained) from the grain. The water is now called wort. The wort is boiled and hops are added. Hops provide flavour and preserve the beer. After boiling the wort is cooled and yeast is added. The yeast turns the sugars into alcohol and the wort into beer."
"Different beers can have different natures, depending on the ingredients used; for example, an ale uses top fermenting yeast. Top fermenting yeasts eat more sugar and produce more alcohol. A lager uses bottom fermenting yeast. Bottom fermenting yeasts eat less sugar and produce a crisper, cleaner taste. Adding hops makes the beer more bitter and aromatic. Specialty malts (different types of cooked barley) produce different flavours and colours. These flavours and colours are most notable in dark beers like Porter and Stout."
"Different countries have different ways to make beer. In Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Czech Republic, and Slovakia, beer is usually made from just hops, malt, water, and yeast. This is because of the Reinheitsgebot. The Reinheitsgebot was a law that said says that beer can only be made from hops, malt, and water. Yeast was discovered after the Reinheitsgebot. The law was overturned by the European Union in 1992. In Belgium, however, beers have always been made with wheat, sugar, fruit, and other ingredients."
Different ways to make beer.
The type of yeast used determines the kind of beer made:
The history of beer.
"The earliest records of beer were written around 7000 years ago by the Sumerians. It is said that the Sumerians discovered the fermentation process by accident. It is not known exactly how this happened, but it could be that a piece of bread or grain became wet, and a short time later, it began to ferment and made a pulp that caused people to become drunk. A seal around 4,000 years old is a Sumerian ""Hymn to Ninkasi"", the goddess of brewing. This ""hymn"" is also a recipe for making beer. A description of the making of beer on this ancient engraving in the Sumerian language is the earliest account of what is easily recognised as barley, followed by a pictograph of bread being baked, crumbled into water to form a mash, and then made into a drink, that is recorded as having made people feel ""...wonderful and blissful"". It could even be possible that bread was first baked to be a way to make beer that is easy to carry around. The Sumerians were probably the first people to brew beer. They had found a ""divine drink"" -- they felt it was a gift from the gods."
Amount of alcohol in beer.
"""Normal"" beers have around 3-5 % alcohol (for the volume, i.e. in 100ml beer there is 3-5ml alcohol). In brewing beer, the amount of alcohol can be made more or less quite easily. The Belgian types of beer are made by adding more sugar. Through the fermentation, this will then turn to alcohol. Today, there are beers with between 2% and about 16% of alcohol (about the same alcohol content as wine). Spirits can have up to 80% alcohol. Some beer labels say there is no alcohol in them because it was taken out later. This is not completely true, though. Beers ""without alcohol"" usually do have less than 1% of alcohol."
IP address
"An IP address (short for Internet Protocol address) is a label which is used to identify one or more devices on a computer network, such as the internet. It can be compared to a postal address. An IP address is a long"
"number written in binary. Since such numbers are difficult to communicate, IP addresses are usually written as a set of numbers in a given order. Devices using IP addresses use the internet protocol to communicate."
Registration.
"The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority assigns IP addresses to regional internet registries (RIRs). The RIRs assign them to Internet Service Providers. Internet Service Providers then assign IP addresses to their customers. Very often, people have a router or gateway at home, to which they connect computers, printers, and other devices. These routers or gateways are often configured to assign ""local"" IP addresses to the devices that are connected."
Parts.
"Each address has two parts: one that specifies the computer or group of computers, and another which specifies the network. A device can have more than one IP address. Certain types of IP addresses are used to address a group of devices, while others are used to address only one device. Certain types of addresses are unique, others can be re-used. A number of IP addresses are used for special purposes, for example to obtain an IP address automatically."
MAC address.
"An IP address is converted to physical or Media Access Control Address using the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP). If an IP address is your phone number, then your MAC address is your name. You may change your phone number, but your name will not change."
Example.
"Suppose one of our friends wants to meet us but they don't know our address. He asks for our address and then we give our address (Example: 123 Main Street, Anytown, USA). After giving the address, he or she can easily locate our address. The same thing is done in case of internet. Every network is assigned an address."
Who allocates IP Address.
IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) allocates the IP address. IANA is responsible for the IP addressing system.
What an IP address looks like.
"An IP address is a long binary number, made of ones and zeros. An IPv4 address is 32 binary digits (or bits) long. An IPv6 is 128 bits long, allowing many more IP addresses to be used. IP addresses are usually written in human-readable form, where 8 bits are grouped into one octet. IPv4 addresses are usually written as a group of four numbers. Each number can take a value from 0 to 255. IPv6 addresses are written as a group of eight hexadecimal numbers. Many Ipv6 addresses contain many zeroes. There are special rules which say that in certain cases, these zeroes do not need to be written."
Public and private addresses.
Pintupi Nine
"The Pintupi Nine were a group of Aboriginal Australians. They are said to have been the last Aborigines in Australia to come into contact with modern civilisation. The group lived a nomadic, hunter-gatherer way of life in the Great Sandy Desert, before they met with their relatives near Kiwirrkurra in October 1984. Most other groups from this region had left the desert over 20 years before. They had been settled in towns to the east and west, but this group had stayed behind."
"The group belonged to the Pintupi community. They lived on the western side of Lake Mackay, north of where Kiwirrkurra is today. It was made up of a single family. The father of the group had recently died, leaving two widows and seven children, most of whom were young adults. The family was moving south, hoping to find some of their relatives. They came across another family setting up an outstation, but ran away after a misunderstanding. Their relatives from Kiwirrkurra went to find them and then brought them into modern society."
Background.
"Most Pintupi families had been settled in rural communities well over 20 years before. Starting from the 1930s, the Pintupi were forced to leave their homeland because of weapons tests being done at Woomera. Most were taken to Papunya, very far to the east, which is historically Luritja land. Others were moved northwest to Balgo, in Kukatja country. After this time, the Pintupi were said to have given up looking for any of their relatives living in the desert after they lost contact with the general community. They believed such people had died."
"By the 1960s, there were only a few families still living as nomads in the desert. Most of them had heard about White people and places like Papunya. But they had not come into contact with them. They chose to keep living in the way they had always lived. This was a problem, because they were all closely related. Pintupi follow a strict system of kinship (called skin groupings) that says who they can marry. It makes sure they avoid inbreeding. As not many families were left in the big desert, there were almost no eligible partners for the younger men and women."
"Much later, the Aboriginal Land Rights Act would be passed by the Northern Territory in 1976. Many Pintupi started to return to their land to set up permanent communities. They established the town of Kintore in 1981. Further west, Kiwirrkurra was founded in 1983 near Lake Mackay. This salt plain is the heart of the Pintupi homeland, and is where this particular family mostly lived."
Family history.
"The family was originally led by a man named Waku Tjungurrayi. He had four wives: Papalya, Nanu, Watjunka and another woman (whose name is not known to outsiders). These wives were all sisters belonging to the Nangala skin group. Papalya was Waku's main wife. They had three children: Topsy, Warlimpirrnga and Takariya. Waku also had another child, Piyiti, with the fourth (unnamed) sister. In the early years, this family sometimes travelled and hunted with another group. It was led by a man named Tjukurti Tjakamarra (later known as Freddy West). In 1962, West and his family decided they would go to live at Papunya. Waku did not want to leave, so they left Waku's family and went east."
"About a year later, the eldest daughter, Topsy, left the group. She married a man named Tommy Tjakamarra, who had come across the family while on his way northeast to Mikantji. Topsy had nobody to marry in her own group and Tommy had the right skin name. So they left to settle at Mikantji. Around this time, Piyiti's mother died."
"Waku died in about 1964. Soon after, a man named Lanti (or ""Joshua"") joined the group and married the three widows. He had lived at Balgo, but left there after getting into trouble with the Catholic missionaries. He came across the group while walking south across the desert. He took Waku's place as leader of the group. Nanu was his main wife. They had three children: Tamayinya, Yalti and Yukultji. Lanti also had another child, Walala, with Watjunka. Watjunka died sometime during the 1970s. When Lanti died around 1980, there were nine left in the group."
Members.
"The group was made up of two women and their seven children. All were born in the desert, so their exact ages are not known."
Story.
Life in the desert.
"The family lived travelling between temporary waterholes around Lake Mackay. They followed the clouds, as the presence of water dictated where they would go. They wore only small belts made out of hair. They carried wooden spears, spear-throwers and boomerangs for hunting. They also had an axe-head that Lanti had brought from Balgo. The group mostly ate lizards, witchetty grubs and bush plants. They also hunted rabbit, kangaroo, emu, goanna and snake."
"The family knew of places like Papunya, Balgo and Mikantji. They knew their relatives lived there. But Lanti had always kept the group away from those places. They had also heard stories about ""kartiya"" (whites), but did not understand who they were. The few encounters they had with modern objects (cars, planes) were associated with the supernatural. In an interview, Warlimpirrnga remembered, ""Joshua had told us about white men and motor cars. We knew there were non-Aboriginal people closing in around us. We didn't know what was happening."""
"To add to this, there were people who knew this family were still living in the desert. These included Topsy and Freddy West. They and their families all moved to Kiwirrkurra in 1983. Other locals would sometimes see campfires in the distance at night and footprints in the sand and knew they belonged to a group wandering the desert. The territory's welfare department were also said to have known about this particular group as early as 1962, and anthropologists working with the Pintupi during this time would often hear about these people."
"The father, Lanti (or ""Joshua""), died sometime around 1980. He died at Kuwarla, at the northern end of Lake Mackay. As is customary, the family moved away from the area in mourning. They travelled south, hoping to find some relatives."
Making contact.
"The encounter that led to the group leaving the desert happened on 13 October 1984. Warlimpirrnga and Piyiti were out hunting. They were at Lake Mackay, about two days walk from where their family was camped. They saw smoke coming from a campfire to the south. It was at Winparku, a waterhole between Kiwirrkurra and Kintore. A man named Pinta Pinta and his two sons were setting up an outstation there. After dark, Warlimpirrnga came close to the group. They were clothed and sitting next to a four-wheel drive. They drew water for Warlimpirrnga from a pump."
"Warlimpirrnga was scared. He was also angry, because these strangers were sitting on the land of his ancestors. They were in fact related, but didn't know each other. Warlimpirrnga knew only about his relatives from what his mothers had told him of them. They had an argument, and Pinta Pinta became frightened. Each thought the other was a featherfoot (sorcerer). When the man's son fired a shot from a rifle, Warlimpirrnga ran off. He took his family north, deep into the desert for safety. This was their first encounter with other people in 20 years."
"Meanwhile, Pinta Pinta and his family drove west through the night to Kiwirrkurra. He told everyone they had seen a featherfoot man. But when he described the man to them, Freddy West said he thought it was Warlimpirrnga. The next day, the elders met and decided to find the group and bring them in. On 15 October, a team of seven Pintupi and Charlie McMahon, the community co-ordinator, went out to Winparku. Together they followed the group's tracks across the desert in two four-wheel drives. On the second night, they could see the family's campfire in the distance. The next day, McMahon had to go back. His friend, Geoff Toll, drove up to continue the search with the others. They found the family the next morning, on 18 October. They had tracked them north for to Maruwa, a waterhole near Lake Mackay."
"On first seeing Toll, a white man, Warlimpirrnga remembers, ""I couldn't believe it. I thought he was a devil, a bad spirit. He was the colour of clouds at sunrise."" Yalti thought the white man was a spirit sent to punish her for something she had done wrong. The family were very scared. They tried to run and hide from the trackers. Warlimpirrnga tried to attack them, but Freddy West was able to calm him by showing him how they were related. The trackers gave the family jam from a tin and pieces of chocolate to eat. They convinced the family to come with them to Kiwirrkurra. They told them that there was lots of food and that water came out of pipes. Yalti said that this concept was unbelievable to them."
After contact.
"When they got to Kiwirrkurra, the family saw their relatives again for the first time in over 20 years. They were angry at them for leaving them behind and not coming to find them. When they saw Topsy, her brother and sister were so angry that they hit her. After a few days, Takariya was married off to Freddy West. It was a gesture between the two groups."
Impact.
"The meaning of the event was understood in many different ways. Agencies serving Aboriginals thought the group's discovery would help them in the debate about indigenous land rights. Fred Myers, an anthropologist who was invited to Kiwirrkurra to study the new group, argues that the event became a part of the Pintupi's struggle to get back their autonomy, which they had lost when they first came out of the desert to settle at Papunya. He argues that their main goal was to maintain the new people's ability to govern their own lives."
News.
"Before news of the group's discovery spread, the leaders of Kiwirrkurra worked to protect the privacy of the family members. They also wanted to protect them from the same kind of shame or teasing they had experienced themselves coming out of the desert many years before."
"One of the first people to be told about the event was the Aboriginal Affairs minister, Clyde Holding. His department wanted to use the group's story in the campaign for Aboriginal land rights. Holding gave the story to ""The Herald"", a newspaper from Melbourne. In exchange, the newspaper agreed not to tell anyone where the group was. The story was first reported on the newspaper's front page on 24 October, with the headline claiming it had ""found the lost tribe"". The news caused a sensation, and instantly made headlines across the country. They became popularly known as the ""Pintupi Nine"" or the ""Last Nomads"". The family themselves, however, would not tell their own story until much later in life."
And she really enjoys it.
She likes the quiet that you have at that time of the night
"and, uh, and, uh, she's, uh, she just started a new job at a different hospital, closer to where she lives"
Uh-huh.
and she's really enjoying herself.
She really likes it.
"Well, that's great."
"Well, good luck to you in pursuing your nursing degree."
Oh thanks
Hope you'll like it.
Yeah.
"Do you plan on staying in, in the Dallas area?"
"Um, I'd like to come back to Dallas."
"Right now I'm in Utah, of course."
"Oh, uh-huh"
"So, um,"
"but, my family's there,"
"so,"
"yeah,"
I'd like to go back.
"Yeah,"
"uh, I think Texas, San Antonio in particular, has got a large, uh, base of hospitals."
"Uh, I don't know about Dallas."
I think Dallas is pretty scattered.
Are you in San Antonio?
"No,"
"I'm, I'm in Dallas"
"Oh, okay."
but I'm originally from San Antonio
Um.
"and they've got large medical, uh, center down there."
They've got the U T Health Science Center out there also.
"Let me see,"
Houston's north.
Yeah?
Okay.
Dallas is south.
"Oh, okay,"
all right.
"Well, that sounds pretty good."
"Does, uh,"
"I guess the weather,"
does that stay pretty constant there
"or,"
"It's, it's gets cold at night, and then warm in the afternoons."
Yeah?
"Probably seventies, eighties in the afternoon."
"Okay,"
"well, that's pretty temperate."
"Yeah,"
that's not too bad.
"But, uh, yeah,"
"have you done, uh, any other boating then"
"or,"
"No,"
"I hadn't done any in a uh, lately,"
"but that's all,"
"I used to uh, have a friend that owned, his daddy owned a boat shop."
Yeah?
"And we used to, when I was in high school, we used to go out, go boating every day just about."
"Oh, that's great."
"Yeah,"
"I,"
And we had a different boat every day.
Uh-huh.
"and the, the, the, third daughter fell in love with, uh, uh, Vermont."
Vermont.
"So,"
So they wanted to make their homes there.
"Yeah,"
that's where they've gone to make their homes.
My goodness.
"Are they, are those two married?"
No.
"They, uh, just working up there or going to school or what?"
"Well, uh, let's see,"
"yeah,"
"I guess you'd say J R is working, going to trying to go to school."
Uh-huh.
I wish to God he would go back.
"Oh, they do. Especially if they, if they're meant to, I think."
Yeah.
"Well, I certainly hope so."
"I mean, I've got a daughter that's a sophomore at U T"
"and I'm, I'm going to U T A right now myself"
so it's never too late.
Uh-huh.
"Well, it's, oh, I agree it's never too late."
Right.
"And,"
"Especially in some of these schools around here, I think they have about twenty percent older students."
"Yeah,"
"and when you're saying older, we're talking fifty up."
"Oh, yeah,"
I've seen some people that are really quite up there you know they look like in their very late sixties
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I prefer OPRAH WINFREY to DONAHUE"
"Oh, yeah."
"Well, she comes on later"
"and I usually have kids around so I don't end, end up watching that one is the only problem I have with it, I guess."
Oh.
"I did watch soap operas,"
"but I work full-time now and can't catch those anymore. Except when I'm home sick,"
Yeah
"and now when I watch them, I think, why did I ever watch those?"
That's right
They're stupid
Yeah.
So when I did watch them I was addicted to them every day.
Uh-huh.
But not anymore.
That can happen.
"So do you know of any other shows in the even, or something that you enjoy?"
"Oh, uh, tonight I'm looking forward to seeing GOLDEN GIRLS."
"Oh, that's always fun."
"Yes,"
I like that show.
Yeah.
"And if I can stay up late enough, I like to catch SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE every now and then."
"Oh, uh-huh."
And right now we're watching a Penn State football game because that's where we live.
"Oh, yeah."
So
Uh-huh.
"It's exciting,"
"we're winning,"
so that's really exciting.
"Yeah,"
Yeah.
It's nice.
"Well, that's good."
"I, I have lived in Texas essentially all my life."
Uh-huh.
Around in Texas
"and, uh, I have traveled up in the northeast and around and have enjoyed it."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, I don't know,"
I'm not sure I would want to take on those winters.
"I'm getting older and, uh, not sure that's something I want to do."
I know.
"I live, uh, over in the Lake Highlands area if you're familiar with that."
"Uh, tell me where that is, uh,"
Okay.
"I, I probably do know,"
"Uh, you,"
but I don't know it by that name.
"This is pretty well where L B J and Audelia, Skillman cross."
Okay.
Sure.
"We're just north of, uh, White Rock Lake."
"Oh, okay,"
"yeah,"
I know that area.
"That's a nice area. Oh, that's quite a range."
"Well, we have some very nice homes here in this area."
"Uh, my particular,"
"I guess they want us to describe the area,"
"so, uh my particular area, the homes run anywhere from about sixty-five, eighty thousand dollars on up to probably half a million."
"Yes,"
"uh, the homes that were here earlier were smaller."
Really.
"It's not like driving a, a Winnebago or something."
"Oh, no"
"No,"
no.
"See, I'm not into station wagons and vans and things that people are really buying now"
and they go isn't that a nice van
"and I go, um."
"Not really, you know."
How about  a Greyhound bus
Nice.
Yeah.
Nice isn't the word I'd choose.
Maybe practical.
Yeah.
"I mean that, you know."
Isn't that a practical van.
There's some that are prettier than others
and
"yeah,"
"the new type is prettier than what their, they used to look like"
"but I sure don't think it's attractive, you know."
"It's not like, like driving a little sports car."
Yeah.
"It, it's very hard to find something practical that's also attractive."
Yeah.
I don't think that happens
"so, but I, I love mine,"
"so, and I, I bought it because I drove a friend's in Hawaii"
and I just went home
and I walked in
and I picked it out
And the same way with those calls.
"What is it,"
"oh M C I, M C I really does."
"Even when you tell them no, they keep calling back."
M C I
what's that?
M C I
it's the long distance telephone company.
"Oh, now see I, I really don't have much trouble with, I just say no thank you and hang up."
"Uh-huh,"
well they they won't take a no for an answer here for some reason.
They just keep calling back.
"I had a carpet service call up three times, all within in an hour,"
Uh-huh.
"but, I, uh, I do telemarketing,"
Uh-huh.
"so, uh, I'm very polite"
"and I just say no thank you, and say no thank you very politely"
"and I hang up and, don't bother me after that."
Uh
Yeah.
So I think the only thing that really bothers me is if when somebody contacts me
and they try to get information out of me.
Uh-huh.
"Like the Census Bureau, United States Census Bureau."
Oh yeah.
That bothered me.
Uh-huh.
I didn't feel they had a right to know how many bedrooms were in my house even.
Right.
That I think is my invasion privacy because it's the government
and I don't understand what their need to know is.
"I, we're, we're new to Iowa"
"so that's something that I hadn't, you know, looked into before."
"But that's one way to sort of get money and still recycle, I guess."
"Yeah,"
"I know a lot of places, they, uh, uh,"
Okay.
"Okay,"
I guess we're ready to start.
"Well, I guess, what part of what part of the country do you live in?"
"I'm in Dallas, Texas."
"Oh, okay."
What about yourself?
"Well, I'm also in Dallas."
Okay.
"The reason that I ask is the two conversations I've had, have been out of state."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, have you always lived here in Dallas"
"and,"
"No,"
I've lived here for almost five years now.
I see.
"And I'm a, uh,"
"before that I was at school in Rochester, New York"
and I'm originally from Boston.
"Oh, well, you are seeing quite a different climate and quite a different neighborhood."
"That's right,"
but I like it.
You probably have enjoyed getting away from the snow.
"Well, I missed it at first,"
but now I go back there
and I'm a real wimp about the cold
So I like it here.
"They aren't testifying really in their own words,"
Right.
"Yeah,"
"I can remember, uh, friends of Daddy ..."
There we go.
Okay.
"Well, uh, what do you think about taxes,"
do you think we're paying too much?
Yes and no.
"Income tax, no."
"I, uh, I look at it this way, uh, you've got to pay for the privilege of living here."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, being a, uh, a rec vehicle owner,"
"well, in fact, I live in a motor home."
I'm a what they call a full timer
"and, uh, it burns gas like crazy."
I only get seven miles to the gallon.
I really resent this fact that they keep adding on gasoline taxes
"and they call it, uh, uh,"
"what's the word they use,"
"anyway, a, a luxury tax."
Yeah.
"They add it on on to tires and gasoline, cigarettes, liquor."
It doesn't bother me any because I've quit drinking
and I quit smoking.
"So, that doesn't bother me"
but I don't think it's fair.
Yeah.
"It's too, um, um, it's attacking just certain people."
How true.
Even with the gasoline tax.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"I think that's,"
Which I think they have to do on rifles and things now too.
"I think there is some, something like that."
Uh-huh
"Anyhow, here, out here in California, I think there is now."
Yeah.
Yeah
"But,"
"I'm not sure,"
"I'm not really sure but, what uh, the gun laws in Pennsylvania are like."
Uh-huh.
Now we don't have guns because we don't go hunting or anything like that.
No.
Uh-huh.
"But like I say, my son, he's, he's always had a,"
"like, I think his first little rifle that we got him was like he twelve or thirteen years old."
Uh-huh.
"But he's always, he went to the, to the school to learn how to shoot it."
He goes to the pistol range
and and the rifle range to shoot them.
"He likes to go to that, uh, shotgun thing where you shoot at those, uh"
"Oh, yeah."
"The skeets, you mean?"
"yeah,"
right
He likes to do that you know
Uh-huh.
"But, uh  I don't know."
Yeah.
"I think they should try to control it and everything, you know."
"But as far as just banning it completely, there, that's not going to happen."
uh-huh.
"So, which I've been doing."
"Well, that's a good way to, to make a little extra money."
Uh-huh.
"Well, this is another way that I'm making a little extra money"
"so that was, you know, nice that I tripped over this opportunity"
and you're actually my first call.
"Oh, really?"
Yeah.
Oh.
"I had not, uh, done"
"I, I guess today  today's my first day that I could  even do it."
"Well, have you called?"
Oh.
"Oh, it is?"
"Yeah,"
"you beat me to the punch, here"
"Oh, well, that, that's nice you know."
"I, I was about to call to get, to see if I could get on with somebody,"
so
Uh-huh.
so that was great.
Yeah.
Well I guess that's about all I can talk to about budgets.
"When I was working, I, uh, bought a bond a month out of my, you know,"
they automatically took it out of my  out of my payroll.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"I take, have some money taken it and put in a Four Oh One K,"
"So, what sort of car are you interested in getting next?"
"Well, actually, I love the car I have."
I have a Chrysler LeBaron convertible.
Right.
"It's just, it's, it's ridiculous."
"She, She's an emotional victim"
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"it, it's terrible, you know"
"and,"
"And, you know, the, like you say, the cops are out doing the work day by day have got to have a lot of frustration when they see all their work, basically go out the window."
Yeah.
"Oh, that,"
"oh, man, I, I couldn't be a cop for that, for that very reason, you know, because they do."
"The, the criminal gets right back out"
"and, you know, the cop's just got to go back and, and do his thing all over again, because so many of the crimes are, are done by repeat offenders."
"Yes,"
they are.
"It's,"
"Well, that's about five minutes,"
"so unless you've got something else, well,"
Yeah.
No
It's a pleasure talking with you.
"All right,"
"Ron, we'll see you later."
"Okeydoke,"
good-bye.
Bye-bye.
Okay.
Tell me about your home.
"Well, it's an older home."
It was made back in the early sixties.
It's a pier beam house.
Huh-uh.
Do you have it there?
I've I think I've seen it around.
"Yes, sir."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Well, I love Mexican food myself."
"Oh, do you?"
Yeah.
But you go ahead now
"Oh, we, we do too."
"We, uh, we enjoy Mexican food."
I'm just not impressed with the quality of it.
"It's just primarily the price that's, uh, satisfying at this point."
"But the kids,  seem to enjoy it."
Is that right?
Uh-huh.
"Uh, and, uh, let's see."
"We've, uh, just recently discovered a super restaurant down here"
"but it's, uh, not part of a chain"
it's just an individually owned seafood restaurant.
"But the first one we've been to that, uh, I don't think there was anything on the menu, that, that any of us had"
"that was, uh, not just really super."
It's nice to find a place like that.
"Oh, boy that is wonderful."
Yeah.
"Well, I, I agree with you on that."
And I was really a seafood addict myself.
"I, I love crab meat in particular."
Um.
"I, uh, I can almost live on, on seafood and almost live on the crab meat if I had to."
"Oh, boy."
"Have you ever been to, uh, what is it, Original Book Binders in Philadelphia?"
and they put him on the scale
and he's up to ninety four now.
Oh.
"But he's not a real, he's not a real tall, uh, dog for a Golden Retriever."
"He's kind of stocky, shorter and stockier."
Um.
"But,"
Is he good with family?
He is.
"It's, uh, just me and my wife"
"and, uh, he's kind of our temporary substitute for having kids."
We treat him like our kid right now so he's spoiled rotten.
"Yeah,"
I can understand that
"Because I,"
Get away with that a little bit more with pets than you can with kids
Uh-huh.
How about you?
"Well, we have a cat who's also about four years old."
Oh.
"And he's our spoiled child right now, too"
Uh-huh.
And he also sheds a lot.
Yeah.
"But, we, uh, we hope to get a Golden Retriever someday."
"But we figure we'll get the kids and then the, the dog"
That's probably a good idea.
They're good though.
"Uh, have you ever had a Retriever before?"
"No,"
but my husband had one when he was growing up.
"Because I, I find that they're good around other animals like cats and other dogs."
So you do spend less time then?
Yeah
"because they don't want to know, they almost don't want to know us."
They want to be with their friends.
How old are your kids?
Are they married or what?
"Uh, yes,"
"I have, uh, two married, two and then two almost married"
"and the other two, I'm not sure."
"Well, Two two, two, uh, uh, for sure are single."
"Oh, boy, you have a lot of kids."
"Yeah,"
"we have, between the spouse and myself we have six."
"Oh, well, that's kind of nice, though."
"You you shouldn't be lonesome on a holiday, huh?"
Because I came with a split family
"and she had,"
"Well, no,"
there is so much of them are gone
and they're doing their own things
"and and a lot of times they, they've got, you know, uh when the holidays,"
"Well, that's true."
"They have to see their other parent, I guess too."
Yeah
"and sometimes they want to do their own thing,"
so sometimes it's just spouse and me.
I know.
"And, and you know what?"
What?
Sometimes that's okay.
I know
"Because,"
"and then slowly but surely starts to creep up when they start to take lessons,"
but it's well worth it and everything.
"Yeah,"
"uh, yeah,"
I think it'll be neat.
"Be a, be a great experience really."
You still there?
"Okay,"
I thought I was cut off there.
"You know, I don't have much to say about drug testing."
"No,"
I can't think of anything else to say about that either.
So you've done this ten times?
Yeah.
Did you get the booklet on how to get the gifts and all?
"No,"
"I don't work for T I,"
so I get cash.
"Oh, okay."
I didn't know what they were going to do.
"They sent us a little booklet,"
"I just got it a week or so ago saying, you know, so many calls will be something a prize and everything."
Right.
Well that great.
Well what kind of cash?
I've forgotten what they going to do.
Hm.
Was it five dollars a call?
"Yeah,"
five dollars a call.
"Well, hope they follow through and everything."
Well technically we're not supposed to talk about the phone calls while we're on them
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, I know exactly what you mean."
"We are fortunate or, uh, we are on a, where we are we get flooded, it floods below us behind us."
Uh-huh.
"But we are, uh, we are high enough that our house itself we never, you know, have had any problem like that."
"Oh, well, that is fortunate."
Yeah.
It is an old farm house
"and, uh, we really like it here."
Uh-huh.
"Well, I, I like it, I like it here."
"Uh, I, I grew up here."
I have lived other places
"and, and, but I, I did grow up here"
Uh-huh.
and this is very much home for me.
Uh-huh.
"And,"
It is nice down there.
"I, I, I liked it when we visited there."
I hope you visited during the winter.
Uh-huh.
"One of my, one of my theories is that you always go to warm places during the winter"
"and you go to cold, cool places, that, well, I go to cool places during the Summer if I can anyway."
Right.
Right.
That is the best time to go.
Yeah.
"and usually it has been when we have gone, it has been nice."
"It has been hot,"
"but it is, it is hot to me in the wintertime down there."
"Oh, sure."
"They don't get, you know,"
Huh-uh.
"and that,"
plus
and then we had a car expense like that same week.
"One of the cars died, you know."
All of this adds up
and that for savings really comes in handy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I can see that.
"I can that,"
"I keep trying to say to her, Laura don't spend so much."
"What happens if something happens to a car, you know."
Right.
"Oh, well, nothing will happen."
Oh.
"All right,"
what type of things would you fix if you're having company come over?
"Well, I have a really great one that I make in the summertime because it's cool"
"and it's, uh, it's just really pretty easy."
It's pretty much dumping things in and stirring.
Uh-huh.
And I like that.
"Uh, the only thing you have to do is cook the rice that goes in, in it"
"and then I, you're supposed to do chicken,"
but I just use those little cans of chicken.
Uh-huh.
"And it makes it so much easier,"
"and so you dump the rice,"
you dump the chicken
"and then you put in fruit like pineapple and mandarin oranges and grape,"
"but, I mean, my mother and her sisters are always saying, uh, to my cousins and I, my female cousins,  you girls are so lucky because quote, unquote, you have all these choices, you know,"
Uh-huh.
"you went to school,"
"Right,"
uh-huh.
"you can do this,"
"you can do that,"
Uh-huh.
we couldn't do that then.
"And my cousins and I go, well why couldn't you"
"Yeah,"
"that's, that's why I say I feel, I feel really lucky right now, because I'm not married and because I don't have children."
"I'm out of school,"
"I'm twenty-three,"
"I can do anything I want to do, anything."
Uh-huh.
"And so, I mean even some days I'm looking for another job now,"
"but, and I get so depressed because, not because I can't find a job, but because I can't figure out what I want to do."
"And that's normal,"
"I mean,  I think that's the world today."
"And yeah,"
and I
"and I'm lucky though, because not a lot of people can sit there and go gee, I don't know what to do."
"I have so  you know,"
Right
that's
"not a lot of people,"
Yeah.
but it's depressing too.
"That's how, I mean,  What, I'm right now."
"What do you, what do you that you're,"
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
That's
"yeah,"
that's a hard thing about it.
"If, I mean, I I can't foresee myself getting married"
"but if, you know, if I ever wanted to have a kid, how could I work."
"I mean, I don't think I could trust somebody with my kid either."
"Unless it was a friend that, you know, did it in ounds like an airplane their house that I knew well."
"Oh, yeah."
That's true.
Yeah.
"I just, I couldn't do it I don't think."
"It would just rip me apart, I think"
I don't know.
Yeah.
Just not knowing.
"Yeah,"
"just besides the fact that, you know, your, when your child gets out of school at three o'clock and then has to wait."
"What do you usually wear to,"
"Well, let's see."
"It turns out that, uh,"
I work at TEKTRONIX
"and it's a very, uh, low key place as far as dress goes."
Uh-huh.
"You just wear, uh,"
let's see.
"When I first came here, I wore suits"
"but after a while I got, uh, found out that that wasn't all that important."
I'm an engineer.
"Oh, I see."
"And, uh, so, I get to wear just, uh, how shall I say it, uh, walking shoes as opposed to dress shoes and well walking, how shall I say it, kind of like Avia, uh, walking shoes, uh,"
Uh-huh.
"and, and, when you turn, When you turn sixty-five why then you pay the tax on it"
"And then, at a took that away as far as being,"
and the tax is a lot less.
Yeah.
"But in the mean time you've got your money tide up in a low, relatively low interest bearing investment."
"I mean, it's not making ten, fifteen percent like a business is today."
Huh-uh.
"Uh, me I'm a firm believer in that if you got it spend it."
"Well, you can come over to my house and spend it"
"Well, you, well, do you, do you need some help spending yours?"
I wish I had some to spend.
No.
No.
I just don't have any.
"Oh, uh-huh."
"Well, that's my problem too."
"I'm, I'm trying to figure out from one payday to the next whose going to be the lucky one this month that's going to get paid."
Yeah.
That's the way it goes
"Well, I guess we probably talked just about long enough."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Uh, let me ask you something."
Did you get a catalog or something from these people?
Yes.
You did?
Uh-huh.
"I've, everybody I've talked to has received one"
but I haven't gotten mine.
"Uh, I don't know."
"Um, well, anyway Ellen, it was nice talking to you."
You too.
"Well, you know, these guys that gambled high lost big you know."
Yeah.
That's true.
"And, uh I'm insulating myself from that problem."
Exactly what happened to them.
I'm building my own house.
"Oh, that's nice."
"And as I look out the window of my trailer, I can envision all the insulation that's going up today"
"Oh, really."
Yeah.
Are you doing it yourself?
Yeah.
Wow.
I used to be a builder.
"Oh, that's nice."
And I retired about five years ago and  started college.
"Oh, I see."
Huh.
And now I'm a college educated builder
"There's still no work, you know."
Yeah.
"So, uh, you know, I decided this summer that, uh, you know, we had enough credit on the credit cards to buy the materials"
so I did.
That's great.
"And, uh, see the, the, the state has a law that says you cannot borrow the money to build your own home."
is that so?
I didn't know that.
You can borrow the money to pay somebody else to build your house
but you can't borrow the money to build your own.
Well that sounds kind of dumb.
"Well, it's to protect the, the banks from guys that say yeah I want to build my own house and go out a build a spec home"
Uh-huh.
"and if, they should pay for it with their life."
Right.
"When you're saying as far as the appeal, uh, procedure was concerned."
Yeah.
"We just have the case,"
"I'm, I'm sure you've probably heard of Marion Berry."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, his last appeal was, was denied two days before his sentence was up"
"Oh, really."
"So, I mean, his appeal was denied"
and two days later he got out of jail For cocaine possession.
"It, uh,"
Yeah.
"But, uh, that was absurd"
"There is never, there was no reason  the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence."
"I know that, that"
Uh-huh.
"And, I don't know."
"Uh, what would you do to change it? To make it better?"
"Well, uh, the, the only I can, I you know,"
"the, appeal procedure is the only thing I can possibly think of."
"Uh, like I said, as far as removing of the jury and having the judge sentence, that's absurd."
There's no way that could work.
"Oh, yeah."
"I, I, I don't agree with that at all."
"Uh, but,"
Imagine the guilt that person would have.
I mean  burned out.
"Oh, exactly."
"There's  there's no possible way that you could, uh, you know, feel good about yourself."
Exactly.
Right.
Yes.
"And then,"
You save a lot.
Right.
"If, if, if, if,"
"and you need to be very careful,"
"if the loan is set up to have bi, they call it a yuppie loan, if it's set up for bimonthly payments."
Right.
"If you,"
because you'll save fifteen to seventeen years off the end of the loan.
Right.
"I'm sorry, seven to nine years off the end of the loan."
Right.
"And there are, there is a local firm that'll actually,"
"if, if,"
"like in my situation, I don't have that, because the loan was not available."
"I can have,"
this firm will pick up my loan for a six hundred fifty dollar fee.
"So I can cut that much off the end of,"
but I'm not interested because we're moving out of the house next year.
Oh really.
Yeah.
"But, uh, those are all great."
Uh-huh.
"The, the interesting thing, we're getting ready to have a house built"
Uh-huh.
"it's not, a lot of the firms that offer,"
"mortgage loan firms, aren't offering, um, that loan."
Uh-huh.
"You can ask and you can wheel and deal,"
but it's not as open as it should be.
Yeah.

"SS ""Calabria was a passenger and cargo steamship. AG Weser built her for Norddeutscher Lloyd. She was launched as D/S ""Werra and completed in 1922. (""D/S"" stands for ""Dampfschiff"" in German as ""SS"" stands for ""steamship"" in English.)"
"In 1935 she was bought by Flotte Riunite Cosulich-Lloyd-Sabaudo Navigazione Generale, who renamed her Calabria. In 1937 she was sold to Lloyd Triestino."
"In June 1940 the UK seized her and placed in the management of the British-India Steam Navigation Company. In December 1940 she was torpedoed and sunk. When she sank, all of her 360 passengers and crew lost their lives. The Ministry of War Transport (MoWT) was going to rename her Empire Inventor, but she was sunk before this had been done."
"The Allied Powers seized numerous NDL ships either during the First World War as prize ships or afterwards for war reparations. In the 1920s NDL replaced them with a new fleet from Bremer Vulkan, AG Vulcan Stettin and AG Weser. The first of the new ships were delivered in 1922; ""Werra"" among them."
"""Werra"" was one of a series of six sister ships that AG Weser built for NDL. ""Werra"" and were completed in 1922; , and in 1923 and in 1924."
"""Werra"" had two three-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines and twin screws. Between them her two engines were rated at 604 NHP. ""Werra"" was equipped with wireless direction finding and submarine signalling."
"In 1935 NDL sold ""Werra"", ""Coblenz"" and ""Saarbrücken"" to Flotte Riunite Cosulich-Lloyd-Sabaudo which renamed them ""Calabria"", ""Sicilia"" and ""Toscana"" and registered them in Genoa. In 1937 the three ships were sold to Lloyd Triestino, which registered ""Calabria"" in Trieste."
"On 10 June 1940 Italy declared war on France and the United Kingdom. At the time ""Calabria"" was in drydock in Calcutta in British India, so on 11 June the British authorities seized her. She was transferred to the MoWT, which appointed the British-India Steam Navigation Company to manage her. The MoWT planned to rename her ""Empire Inventor"", but this intention was overtaken by events."
"In December 1940 ""Calabria"" was ""en route"" to the UK with a cargo of 4,000 tons of iron, 3,050 tons of tea and 1,870 tons of oilcake. Her Master, David Lonie, commanded 128 officers and crew plus one DEMS gunner. She was also carrying 230 mostly Indian supernumaries who were travelling to crew other ships. Calabrias crew and supernumaries included also four Hong Kong Chinese crewmen and one Danish merchant officer."
"""Calabria"" left Freetown in Sierra Leone with convoy SLS-56 to the UK but fell behind. On the evening of Sunday 8 December German Type IX submarine , commanded by the U-boat ace Viktor Schütze, torpedoed her in the Western Approaches about west of Slyne Head in County Galway, Ireland. U-103 hit ""Calabria"" with one torpedo at 2058 hrs and a second at 2106 hrs. All 360 hands and passengers were lost: there were no survivors."
"""Calabria""s latitude was 52 degrees 26 minutes north, at that time of year the sun would have set just before 1600 hours local time, and the ship would have been blacked out under wartime regulations. However, the moon was waxing gibbous, had risen at 1315 hrs and did not set until 0218 hrs in the small hours of the next morning. If the sky was clear, Schütze would have been able to target ""Calabria"" by moonlight."
"The oldest man aboard was ""Calabria""s chief cook, Santan Martins, who was 79 years old. Martins may have been the oldest merchant seaman killed at sea in the Second World War."
"Those who died in ""Calabria""s sinking are commemorated in the Second World War section of the Merchant Navy War Memorial at Tower Hill in London. Her Indian seamen and supernumaries are commemorated in the Commonwealth War Graves Commission monuments at Chittagong and Mumbai."

NRLM will be implemented in a mission mode. This enables:
"(a) shift from the present allocation based strategy to a demand driven strategy, enabling the states to formulate their own livelihoods-based poverty reduction action plans."
"(b) focus on targets, outcomes and time bound delivery."
"(c) continuous capacity building, imparting requisite skills and creating linkages with livelihoods opportunities for the poor, including those emerging in the organized sector."
(d) monitoring against targets of poverty outcomes.
"As NRLM follows a demand driven strategy, the States have the flexibility to develop their own livelihoods-based perspective plans and annual action plans for poverty reduction. The overall plans would be within the allocation for the state based on inter-se poverty ratios."
"The second dimension of demand driven strategy implies that the ultimate objective is that the poor will drive the agenda, through participatory planning at grassroots level, implementation of their own plans, reviewing and generating further plans based on their experiences. The plans will not only be demand driven, they will also be dynamic."

"Norman Gunther Dyhrenfurth (Breslau, today Wroclaw, May 7, 1918 – Salzburg, September 24, 2017) was a German-Swiss-American mountaineer and filmmaker. He was the leader of the successful American Mount Everest Expedition of 1963, which placed six climbers on the summit."
"Norman Dyhrenfurth was born in Germany, the son of Himalayan explorers Günter Oskar Dyhrenfurth and Hettie Dyhrenfurth. His mother was of half Jewish ancestry. After the Nazis came to power, they emigrated, first to Austria in 1933, then two years later to Switzerland, where they became citizens. In 1936, Dyhrenfurth's parents were awarded a gold medal for alpinism at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. He emigrated to the United States in 1937. His service in the United States Army enabled him to gain joint U.S.-Swiss citizenship. He was the founder of the Motion Picture Division of the Department of Theater Arts at UCLA, but resigned that position in 1952. In 1954, he was a Fulbright scholar in Italy."
"Dyhrenfurth first came to the attention of the mountaineering community in the United States in 1939, when he completed some challenging climbs in the Grand Tetons. He was a participant in the 1952 Swiss Mount Everest Expedition. In 1960, he was cameraman for the Swiss expedition to Dhaulagiri, and after that climb, approached the government of Nepal about obtaining a permit for an American expedition to climb Mount Everest. He learned that a permit had already been granted to another American climber, William Hackett. Although Dyhrenfurth tried to combine his efforts with Hackett's, that expedition failed to gain funding and never took place. Another application resulted in India being selected for an attempt to climb Everest, but Dyhrenfurth persevered and tried again."
"Dyhrenfurth received a permit from the Nepalese authorities on May 10, 1961, for an American expedition to climb Mount Everest in the spring of 1963. He recruited a team of climbers that included Jake Breitenbach, Jim Whittaker, Willi Unsoeld, Lute Jerstad, Tom Hornbein, Dave Dingman and Barry Bishop. William Siri was the deputy team leader. Al Auten was the radio operator, and Gil Roberts was the team doctor. Sherpa Nawang Gombu was also part of the team."
"On March 23, 1963, Breitenbach was killed in the collapse of a serac in the Khumbu Icefall just above Everest Base Camp. The members of the expedition decided to proceed. Dyhrenfurth's style of leadership being democratic and team-oriented, he called a meeting, discussed the tragedy, let everyone speak, and when the decision was made to continue, the team remained intact. Dyhrenfurth's leadership style included a ""commitment to consensus"", and he was considered by those who have studied the expedition a ""huge asset to the team""."
"On May 1, Whittaker and Gombu reached the summit of Mount Everest by the South Col route used by the successful British expedition of 1953."
"On May 22, Unsoeld and Hornbein completed the first ascent of the West Ridge, descending by the South Col, thus completing the first traverse of Everest. That same day, Bishop and Jerstad reached the summit by the South Col route. The two pairs of climbers met up high on the mountain, and made their descent in the gathering darkness. From midnight until 4:00 am, they bivouacked high on the mountain, without sleeping bags, tents or bottled oxygen. All survived, though Unsoeld and Bishop suffered from frostbite, resulting in the amputation of toes."
"As he was taught that Islam and politics do not mix he says that """"one part of the book has stayed with me."""" This being the chapter ""Political System in Islam"". He says that Sarwar said that Politics within Islam is fundamental."
"Husain goes on to say that """"What I did not know at school was that Sarwar was a business management lecturer, not a scholar of religion. And he was an activist in the organisations that he mentioned Muslim Brotherhood and Jamat-e-Islami. Sarwar's book was not the dispassionate educational treatise it purported to be."""" and that """"He was also the brains behind the separation of Muslim children from school assemblies into what we called 'Muslim assembly', managed by the Muslim Educational Trust (MET) [of which Sarwar is the Director]. What seemed like an innocuous body was, in fact, an organisation with an agenda. In my school, a Jamat-e-Islami activist named Abdul Rabb represented the MET and awarded us trophies and medals for our performance in MET exams. Ostensibly it all seemed harmless, but the personnel all belonged to Jamat-e-Islami front organisations in Britain. Their key message was that Islam was not merely a religion but also an ideology that sought political power and was beginning to make headway."""""
"However, when Husain quotes Sarwar on page 21 of ""The Islamist"" regarding politics and Islam (page 169 of Sarwar's book), he does so but, although not wrong, he words the quoting very differently from what is actually written in Sarwar's book."
"Additionally, as discussed above, Husain mentions that """"What I did not know at school was that Sarwar was a business management lecturer, not a scholar of religion.""""

"Norcot is an area of the suburb of Tilehurst in the town of Reading, in the English county of Berkshire. It is also an electoral ward of the Borough of Reading."
"Norcot ward is the far eastern sector of the Reading borough portion of Tilehurst. As a commonly used suburban area, Norcot centres on Norcot Road and the upper Oxford Road on Norcot Hill. It is electorally partly in Norcot ward and partly in Kentwood to its west. All these areas form a mixture of suburban and urban parts of West Reading. The original hamlet was near the junction of Norcot Road and Romany Lane and was largely made up of Norcot Farm in the north-east of old Tilehurst parish. The name means 'North Cottage' and has a southern neighbour Southcote, below Tilehurst church and manor."
"The Norcot Water Tower, built at the end of the 19th century, is somewhat older than the more prominent Tilehurst Water Tower. It is 50ft high, a Grade II listed building and since 2002 has been converted into a luxury apartment. Norcot School was built in 1906. In its lifetime, it was both a senior and a junior school. It closed in 1989. Like much of Tilehurst, Norcot Hill was used for the extraction of clay for brickmaking. In the 1920s, S. E. Collier's transported the clay via overhead cables to their main site in the Dee Road area of Tilehurst. St George's Church, Reading was built on the north-eastern edge of Norcot in 1886, largely to service the soldiers of the nearby Brock Barracks. Norcot Mission Church was started in 1929 to serve the new Norcot council estate. It started in a hut on land rented from the Pulsometer Engineering Works.

Jurby () is one of the seventeen parishes of the Isle of Man.
"It is located in the north-west of the island (part of the traditional ""North Side"" division) in the sheading of Michael."
"For the purposes of local government, the whole of the historic parish forms a single parish district with Commissioners."
The Captain of the Parish (since 1999) is John James Quayle.
"Jurby parish is part of the Ayre & Michael constituency, which elects two Members to the House of Keys. Before 2016 it was in the Michael constituency."
"The Isle of Man census of 2016 returned a parish population of 776, a decrease of 2.7% from the figure of 797 in 2011."
"The parish of Jurby, which lies on the north-western coast of the island, borders those of Andreas to the east, Lezayre to the south-east, and Ballaugh to the south. It is low-lying overall: the highest elevations are some coastal dunes with a height of up to 39 metres."
"There is an industrial park on the old RAF Jurby Airfield, but otherwise the district is almost entirely agricultural. Apart from the Jurby airfield buildings, there are no significant settlements in the parish."
Jurby Airfield was originally used as a Royal Air Force training base in World War II. During the 1950s it was used as a training camp for Officer cadets on short term commissions in the RAF. The course lasted three months. Part of the airfield is now used as an industrial and retail estate. The old runways and taxiways now form the Jurby motorcycle race track.
"The grassland surrounding the airfield harbours many wildflowers, as the land has never been ploughed. Skylarks can be heard in summer when there are no races on. A large part of the airfield therefore has statutory protection under the Wildlife Act 1990 as an Area of Special Scientific Importance."
"A museum dedicated to transport in the island, the Jurby Transport Museum, is housed in an old aircraft hangar."
"Another museum nearby, the Isle of Man Motor Museum, was officially opened by the Lieutenant Governor on 22 May 2015."
"A tiny 8th century chapel dedicated to St Cecilia (the patron saint of music), was Jurby's first recorded church. St Cecilia's Day on 22 November was the parish festival day. There are several Viking carved crosses and gravestones within the church. Medieval objects have occasionally been excavated when new graves were prepared in the church grounds."
In medieval times the church was part of the Whithorn diocese in SW Scotland. This caused some political trouble when the English and Scots were at war; the Bishop invited the Scottish clergy of Jurby to visit him and was criticised by English authorities for fraternising with the enemy.
"The present St. Patrick's Church, Jurby was built during the war with help of RAF Jurby. There are a number of war graves, for British, Commonwealth and Polish servicemen. They died mostly from aircraft training accidents."
"The church is set on a slight headland on the coast and there are views south to Peel, north to Scotland, and inland across the rural north of the island, towards the hills."
The Isle of Man Prison operated by the Isle of Man Prison Service is located at Jurby.
Jurby was historically subdivided into five treens:

"David Gervan McMillan (26 February 1904 – 20 February 1951), known as Gervan McMillan, was a New Zealand politician of the Labour Party, and a medical practitioner."
"McMillan was born in 1904 in New Plymouth, the eldest child of Annie Gertrude Pearce and David McMillan, a dairy farmer near Stratford. He received his secondary education at Stratford Technical High School, where he was dux. With the help of the Taranaki Scholarship, he could afford to study medicine at the University of Otago, from where he graduated MB ChB in 1929. He was a medical practitioner, first practising in Kurow (1929–34) and then at 115 Highgate in Kaikorai, Dunedin (c.1935-36, after which the building was his electorate office to 1943, then again a medical practice after he had left parliament). The building was demolished after 1950 to make way for the Stuart Street extension."
"McMillan became involved with the Labour Party in 1923. In his view, good health extended beyond good medical support, but included educational, economic, and social factors."
"He represented the Dunedin West electorate from to 1943, when he retired. He was Minister of Marine (1940–1941) in the First Labour Government, and was responsible for much of the social security system introduced by Labour."
"In 1940 he ran for the position of Labour Party leader, being nominated by Arnold Nordmeyer, a friend from Kurow and a supporter of John A. Lee. Clyde Carr also ran, but the winner to replace Savage was his deputy, Peter Fraser."
"He was a Dunedin City Councillor for 1935–1938, 1938–1941, 1944–1947 and 1950–1951. He twice unsuccessfully stood for the Dunedin mayoralty; he was beaten by Andrew Henson Allen and Donald Charles Cameron in 1941 and 1944, respectively."

She currently resides in Barnes, South-West London with her husband Ross Allen, a garden designer and their daughter Camille."
"Davies' father, the stage and television actor Geoffrey Davies, influenced her choice of career immensely. He would often let her watch his stage performances from the wings as a child. She says that she ""watched his plays nearly every night"" and ""knew all the lines."""
"He also landed Emma her first television role at the age of 18 months on the 1970s sitcom, ""The Fenn Street Gang"". She says, ""I was in a pram and had to stuff an ice cream cone into someone's face!""."
She also appeared in a television advert for Colgate toothpaste when she was 14.
"She trained at the Corona Theatre School in London, and has been acting in small TV roles since the mid-1980s. In that time she has appeared in television series ""Heartbeat"", ""Doctors"" and Sky One's ""Dream Team""."
"Her first television role was as teenager Jo Daly in Central Television's Midlands based drama ""Boon"" between 1987 and 1989. She later played Juliette Bannerman in the ITV soap ""Families"" in 1993."
"In 1997, Emma portrayed the controversial historical figure Diana Mitford (later Diana Mitford-Guinness and Lady Diana Mosley) in the biographical Channel Four mini-series ""Mosley""."
"In 2001, she also had a small role in Michael Apted's popular film ""Enigma"". And in 2007 she was cast alongside David Morrissey, Lucy Cohu and Tristan Gemmill in the short-lived Channel Four drama ""Cape Wrath"", as regular character Abigail York."

= = = Commodity value = = =
"In the field of economics, the commodity value of a good is its free market intrinsic value under optimal use conditions. In a free market, the commodity value of a good will be reflected by its price. For example, if an acre of land can yield a net of 100 dollars loss by lying fallow, 50 dollars gain by being planted with corn, and 100 dollars gain by being planted with wheat, then that acre's commodity value is 100 dollars; the farmer is assumed to put his land to best use. The price of a commodity fluctuates around its commodity value."
"A commodity value expressed as a price is determined by historical, social and cultural aspects of production and distribution. Karl Marx described price as the money-name for the labour realised in a commodity. A commodity value is dependent on its utility."
"Commodity value is of particular significance in the study of currency. For example, the commodity value of a coin is the value of the metal of which it is made. Gold and silver coins have a high commodity value, whereas fiat coins such as modern day quarters have a low commodity value. This is of particular historical relevance when analyzed in light of Gresham's Law."
"Because money becomes valuable not due to its substance, that is, its commodity value, but rather because of its performance, currencies tend to become token."
"Neapolitan Way (Foaled January 27, 1971) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse. A son of Barbizon and a grandson to Polynesian, he was out of a Bold Ruler mare named Bold Majesty. Neapolitan Way is best remembered for placing second in the second jewel of the American Triple Crown, the $250,000 grade 1 Preakness Stakes, to Little Current."
"Neapolitan Way's race history is very sketchy and vague, but he won 14 races during his career. It is also known that he placed in the top three finishers in 43% of his starts, a total of 36 out 84 in-the-money races. At age two, he finished third in the Miami Beach Handicap at Calder Race Course. At age three, he won the grade three Woodlawn Stakes (now renamed the James W. Murphy Stakes) at a mile on the turf at Pimlico Race Course and placed third in the Japan Racing Association Stakes at Laurel Park Racecourse. At age four, he placed third in the grade two Dixie Stakes at Pimlico."
"In mid May 1971, Neapolitan Way's trainer Lawrence W. Jennings decided to take a step up in class and run him in the second jewel of the Triple Crown. The Preakness Stakes is run at a mile and three sixteenths on dirt at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland. Neapolitan Way was listed as one of the longest shots on the board at 24-1 on the morning line in a field of thirteen colts. The prohibitive favorite was the Kentucky Derby winner, Cannonade, at 2-1. Neapolitan Way broke slowly in tenth place out of thirteen and was outrun early under jockey Herb Hinojosa. Going into Pimlico's famous ""Clubhouse Turn,"" he fell further back into dead last. The fractions were moderate on the front end, with the first quarter in :231/5 and the half in :47 seconds. Going into the final turn, Neapolitan Way lugged in and collided with Hudson County, causing a severe cut high on his left rear leg. After the move inward, Hinojosa applied steady left handed whipping, straightening Neapolitan Way out at the top of the stretch. In the lane, he moved up quickly from 13th to 11th to 7th and then hit another gear. He started picking off horses, including Cannonade. In deep stretch, he moved into second place but was no threat to the winner, Little Current, who finished between seven and 21 lengths in front of the rest of the field. Cannonade finished one length behind Neapolitan Way in third with Jolly Johu three quarters of a length back in fourth. Neapolitan Way took home the 20% runner-up's share of the purse, equalling $30,000."

"In heraldry, a mount (also mountain, hill, hillock) is a representation of a hill or mountain as a curved terrace in base. When the mount is included in the lower part of the shield, it may be considered an ordinary rather than a charge."
"A trimount, also described as ""a mount mounted"", or ""shapournet shapourned"", is a representation of a mount with three tops. For mounts with more than three tops, the number of tops is blazoned as ""coupeaux"" (e.g. ""a mount with six coupeaux"")."
"The trimount (in German, ""Dreiberg"") can be found in all heraldic traditions (Gallo-British, German-Nordic and Latin), but it is especially common in Switzerland."
"A design of six hills (""Sechsberg"") can also be found in Swiss and Italian heraldry. In medieval German heraldry, mounts could have ten or more tops. Mounts with more than three tops are blazoned as a ""mount of N coupeaux"", e.g. German ""Sechsberg"" would be a ""mount of six coupeaux"", German ""Zehnberg"" as a ""mount of ten coupeaux"". A mount with more than six tops can also be blazoned as ""Schroffen"" in German heraldry."
"A ""terrace in base curved"" is blazoned ""mount"", ""hill"" or ""hillock"" when represented in vert; sometimes as ""a mount vert"" for clarity. Sometines, a ""terrace in base curved"" may be blazoned as ""mount"" even when not tinctured vert. This is mostly found in cases where the base represents a hill for one or several of the charges in the coat of arms. Classification either as an ordinary or, in many cases, as a charge, is a matter of interpretation."

In the fall of 1941, German forces evicted the residents of the village to make room for the planned resettlement of Gottschee Germans.

= = = Sesame Street (comic strip) = = =
"Sesame Street is a nationally syndicated comic strip inspired by ""Sesame Street"". Written and drawn by veteran Sesame animator Cliff Roberts, the earliest concept art was created in 1970, and by 1971, a promotional booklet was created as the comic entered the market, courtesy of King Features. The strip debuted on November 15, 1971, in more than 175 newspapers, and ran until 1975. The strip, which ran both daily and on Sundays, was conceptually similar to the series in its pedagogical goals, but, in the first year of the strip, conspicuous by the absence of the Muppets."
"Instead, the strip featured several new characters created by Roberts, such as Jasper and Julius, Christopher Clumsy, and Miss Fortune; in 1972, all of these characters appeared in animated inserts on ""Sesame Street"" itself. Also regularly seen was Professor Drummond Bugle, a lecturer, similar to more generic characters used in Roberts' animated segments. Roberts fleshed out the strip's cast with a vast menagerie of newly minted animal characters. Amongst them were Lotta Elephant, Richard Bird, Hedda the frog, Balderdash the mouse, Titus the snake, Thomas Turtle, Crawley the worm, and an errant spider. A pair of nameless, Muppet-esque monsters also skulked through on occasion."
"Though the earlier version of the strip avoided the Muppets, Big Bird, Oscar the Grouch and Cookie Monster joined the cast in December 1972, and appeared through the end of the strip's run in 1975."
"Like ""Sesame Street"", the comic strip was largely educational, using broad humor to relate learning concepts. The most frequent topics were parts of the body, shapes, and identification of objects. Other subjects included opposites or pairings (up and down, here and there, etc.) and emotions. Letters and numbers surfaced rarely, presumably because the strip's target audience was different from the largely pre-literate television audience. However, many strips were pure comedy, revolving around the characters' eccentricities and foibles."

"Marguerite Bellanger (10 June 1838 - 23 November 1886) was a French stage actress and courtesan. She was a celebrity of Second Empire France and known for her relationship with Napoleon III of France. She was often caricatured in contemporary press and is considered to be the model for Émile Zola's ""Nana"". A candy is also named after her. She was reputedly the most universally loathed of Napoleon III's mistresses, though perhaps his favorite. She outlived Napoleon's deposal in 1870 and died in 1886 aged 48."
"Marguerite Bellanger was born Julie Justine Marine Lebœuf on 10 June 1838 in Saint-Lambert-des-Levées, Maine-et-Loire to François Lebœuf and Julie Hanot. Born into poverty, she began working as a laundress in Saumur at the age of 15."
"After an affair with a lieutenant opened her eyes to the wider world, she became an acrobat and trick rider in a provincial circus, she travelled to Paris where she made her debut as an actress at the theater ""La Tour d'Auvergne"", under the name of Marguerite Bellanger (the surname of an uncle)."
"Although her acting talent was limited, she was cunning. She became one of the most sought-after cocottes of all Paris. She led a princely lifestyle, and the climax of her gallant life took place in the years 1862-1866. She is reported to have said: ""It is very nice Paris, but it is only habitable in the beautiful districts ... In the others, there are too many poor!"" according to ""Le Rappel"" of 16 April 1871. Author and playwright, Ludovic Halévy, is reputed to have said that Bellanger had the ""daintiest feet in Paris""."
Her celebrity status was such that she became a figure in the literary and artistic world. Zola quoted her as a friend of Nana.
"In 1947, he returned to Italy and a year later published his memoirs as ""Due dittatori di fronte"" (""[Two] Dictators Face to Face"" – i.e.: Mussolini and Hitler). Much details about the hierarchy and events of the war, not well known, are in the book."

"Gaustatoppen is the highest mountain in the county Telemark in Norway which lies in the municipality Tinn and Hjartdal. The view from the summit is impressive, as one can see an area of approximately 60,000 km², one sixth of Norway's mainland. The mountain is popular for downhill skiing in winter, and competitions have been held on its slopes. These competitions include the ""Norseman triathlon"", billed as ""the world's most brutal iron-distance triathlon"". It starts in Eidfjord and finishes at the top of Gaustatoppen. The summit is accessible on foot in the summer, on a rocky pathway of medium difficulty, although the southern side of the mountain is very dangerous and inaccessible. The wreckage of an airplane crash lies there, as it is too difficult to remove it."
"The first element is ""Gausta"", the name of the whole mountain, the last element is the finite form of ""topp"" m 'top, summit'. The name ""Gausta"" is probably a shortened form for ""*Gaustafjell"" (Gausta mountain), because Gausta originally was the name of a farm beneath the mountain. (For the same development see Dovre.) The Old Norse form of the name was maybe ""*Gautstǫð"", the name is then a compound of ""gaut"" f 'flooded place', and ""stǫð"" f 'stead, landing place for boat'. (The farm lies at Rjukan river.)"
"There is a funicular railway inside the mountain, built for military purposes. This ascends from the base of the mountain almost to the summit. A short railway takes the passengers from the mountain base horizontally to the lower station deep inside the mountain. It was built to access the military radio relay station built at and inside the mountain top. The installation is now a tourist attraction. It was financed mainly by American military grants, and cost one million US dollars to build from 1954 to 1959."

"Portloe is a small village in Cornwall, England, UK, situated on the Roseland Peninsula, within the civil parish of Veryan, east of the village of the same name. Portloe harbours two full-time working fishing vessels, the ""Jasmine"" and ""Katy Lil"", which fish for crab and lobster in Veryan and Gerrans Bay, and a fleet of smaller leisure boats in summer. The harbour is run by a committee, the chair of which is Charles Williams. Visitors are attracted to Portloe by its fishing, scenery, and walks."
"Portloe lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Almost a third of Cornwall has AONB designation, with the same status and protection as a National Park. The South West Coast Path passes through the village."
The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) stationed a lifeboat at Portloe in 1870 but it was withdrawn in 1887 without ever having performed a rescue. It was kept at first in a boat house built at the end of the road above the beach. It proved difficult to move the boat across the beach so a new house was built in 1877 nearer the water. The first house was converted into a church; the second was a school for a while but has since become a private dwelling house.

"Paradise Valley High School (PVHS) was the first of five high schools built in the Paradise Valley Unified School District, located in Phoenix, Arizona. Paradise Valley High School opened in 1957. The school's athletic teams are referred to as the Trojans. Featuring a Block Schedule, Paradise Valley teaches a wide selection of courses in not only core academics but also technology and the arts. The football program installed one of the first artificial turfs in the state, the only Sprinturf installation in Arizona, as its main football, soccer, and track field at a cost of $1 million."
"Paradise Valley opened in 1957 at Bell Road and 40th street which at the time was on the outskirts of Phoenix. The original campus consisted of an administration building, several small classroom buildings and a small gymnasium and athletic fields located to the north of the classroom buildings. In the 1960s a library, cafeteria, shop building and three larger classroom buildings were added to the campus. The gymnasium was also expanded in the 1960s. In the early 1970s a new building called the 700 building was constructed. Between 1976 and 1979 several new buildings designed by the Tempe architecture office of Michael & Kemper Goodwin Ltd. The plan included a new vocational education building and an additional physical education building. In 1982 the remaining 1957 classroom buildings were demolished to make way for a larger classroom building. The new building was nearly complete when the 1983-1984 school year began. At that time the 1960s buildings were updated. In 1983 the 700 building was demolished to make way for a new 1,200 seat auditorium and associated fine arts building. The auditorium and fine arts building were completed in 1984. In 1990 it was decided that Paradise Valley would close its original campus and move to a new campus being constructed at Union Hills Drive and 16th Street. The new campus opened for the 1991-1992 school year. It was then decided that the original campus would be renovated and reopened. The original gymnasium as well as the administration building were demolished and rebuilt and the campus was thoroughly spruced up. The updated school reopened for the 1993-1994 school year. The new campus on Union Hills was then renamed North Canyon High School. The CREST STEM program was established in 2010 offering students classes in Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics. In 2013 the three 1960s classroom buildings were demolished to make way for two new twin story buildings housing the science department and CTE classes. In 2013 the auditorium was also completely renovated. The 2013 projects were completed by McCarthy Construction."
When the school was established the Paradise Valley High School District was also created. In July 1976 the high school district unified with the elementary district to form the Paradise Valley Unified School District.

"The road opened in 1945 as a Farm to Market Road. The road is now officially designated by TxDOT as Urban Road 620, but all Urban Roads in Texas retain their former Farm or Ranch to Market highway signs."
"RM 620 was originally designated on July 9, 1945 as Farm to Market Road 620 from Round Rock to SH 29, the former designation of US 183 south of Liberty Hill until May 23, 1951. On May 13, 1946, the road was extended to the Travis County line. On August 26, 1948, the road was extended to the former community of Hickmuntown, also called Four Points, at the location of the current intersection with RM 2222.

"James Ronald McDaniels (April 2, 1948 – September 6, 2017) was an American professional basketball player. McDaniels played collegiately for Western Kentucky University and was the No. one overall pick in the 1971 American Basketball Association Draft. McDaniels was an NBA All-Star."
"A 6'11"" power forward/center, McDaniels averaged nearly 40 points per game as a senior at Allen County High School in Scottsville, Kentucky. From 1967 to 1971, he played at Western Kentucky University, leading his team to a third-place finish in the 1971 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. (The NCAA later voided Western Kentucky's participation in the tournament, accusing McDaniels of signing with an agent while still in college.) He also set WKU school records with 2,238 career points (now tied with Courtney Lee) and 1,118 career rebounds."
"McDaniels was drafted by the Seattle SuperSonics in the second round of the 1971 NBA draft and No. one overall by the Dallas Chaparrals in the 1971 American Basketball Association Draft, but he began his professional career with the Carolina Cougars of the American Basketball Association, who offered him a $1.35 million contract to be paid over twenty-five years. Reportedly, the Cougars first approached McDaniels during November 1970, while he was still playing for Western Kentucky. McDaniels averaged 26.8 points and 14 rebounds in 58 games with the Cougars during the 1971–72 season and scored 24 points and grabbed 11 rebounds in the 1972 ABA All-Star Game. However, he feuded with the Cougars while trying to renegotiate his contract – he wanted his salary to be spread over fifteen years, rather than twenty-five – and near the end of his rookie season he decided to leave the Cougars for the SuperSonics."
"McDaniels remained with Seattle for the next two full seasons. However, he struggled to maintain the same level of production he had achieved in the ABA, and by the 1973–74 NBA season, McDaniels was averaging just 5.5 points per game. During that time, McDaniels was dogged by off-court troubles as the Cougars questioned the legality of his jump to the NBA. He later admitted in an interview, ""I should have stayed in the ABA for a couple of years. I was just young and things started going bad for me there and I didn't know how to handle them."" SuperSonics coach and general manager Bill Russell ultimately released McDaniels in fall 1974."
"Tracey Lee Wickham (born 24 November 1962 in Rosebud, Victoria) is an Australian former middle distance swimmer. Wickham was the World Champion for the 400 m and 800 m freestyle in 1978, and won gold in both events at the 1978 and 1982 Commonwealth Games. She is a former world record holder for the 400 m, 800 m and 1500 m freestyle. Despite her success in the pool, Wickham has battled hardship and personal tragedy throughout her life."
"Wickham began swimming at the age of eight at John Rigby’s pool in Brisbane and mastered her technique under the guidance of Peter Diamond. At the age of thirteen, she was selected to be on the Australian team for the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games but failed to reach the finals at that meet."
"In 1977, Wickham’s family moved to California, where she trained for six months with coaching legend Mark Schubert. She returned to Brisbane at the end of 1977 and she came under the guidance of coach Bill Sweetenham at the Commercial Swimming Club. On 8 February 1978, Wickham broke her first world record, the 1500 m freestyle, in a solo swim at the Fortitude Valley Pool in Brisbane, clocking 16:14.93."
"At the 1978 Commonwealth Games in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, Wickham won both the 400 m and 800 m freestyle. That same year, she set world records in both events, and won both the 400 m and 800 m freestyle at the 1978 Berlin World Championships, setting a world 400 m record of 4.06.28, which stood as the Championship record until 2007. Both world records stood until 1987, long after her retirement."
"In 1980, Australia decided against an official boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics. A number of Australian athletes elected to boycott the Games personally. Wickham maintains that she withdrew from the team because of illness, as she was suffering glandular fever at the time, not because of the boycott. The 800 m freestyle was won by fellow Australian Michelle Ford at that meet."
"Wickham retired at the end of 1979 due to financial problems. The policy of amateurism was upheld by the Amateur Swimming Union of Australia during this period, meaning Wickham could neither earn money from the sport nor receive any prizes."
"Wickham returned to swimming in the early 1980s under coach Laurie Lawrence. She won gold in the 400 m and 800 m freestyle at the 1982 Commonwealth Games, where she took the Athletes Oath at the Opening Ceremony. Her gold medal for the 400 m was presented to her by Queen Elizabeth II and Wickham retired from swimming immediately afterwards."
"Following the birth of her daughter, Wickham dived back into the water in May 1990, again with Lawrence as her coach. She competed in the 7.6 km open water race from Magnetic Island to Townsville, placing first in the female division. She also won the female division of the Lake Trasimeno 20 km marathon race. She retired for good following the birth of her son in January 1992."
"She was educated at the All Hallows' School, in Brisbane along with her sisters Julie and Kelly. Wickham married in 1986 and had two children, Daniel and Hannah. She divorced her husband in the mid-1990s."
"Her daughter, Hannah, died at the age of nineteen from synovial sarcoma on 2 October 2007. Wickham is an ambassador for Hannah’s Chance Foundation, which supports teenage cancer victims."
"On 30 December 1978, Wickham was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire."
"On 10 December 1985, she was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame, and was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame at Fort Lauderdale in 1992."
"On 25 October 2000, she was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for outstanding contribution as a competitor in swimming."
"On 13 June 2005, she was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for service to Australian swimming and to the development of young swimmers through teaching and coaching roles."

= = = Tarr = = =
"Tarr is a modernist novel by Wyndham Lewis, written in 1909–11, revised and expanded in 1914–15 and first serialized in the magazine ""The Egoist"" from April 1916 until November 1917. The American version was published in 1918, with an English edition published by the Egoist Press appearing shortly afterwards; Lewis later created a revised and final version published by Chatto and Windus in 1928. Set in the bohemian milieu of pre-war Paris, it presents two artists, the Englishman Tarr and the German Kreisler, and their struggles with money, women and social situations. The novel abounds in somewhat Nietzschean themes. Tarr, generally thought to be modelled on Lewis himself, displays disdain for the 'bourgeois-bohemians' around him, and vows to 'throw off humour' which he regards—especially in its English form—as a 'means of evading reality' unsuited to ambition and the modern world. This self-conscious attitude and the situations that it brings about are a major source of the novel's pervasive dark humour. Lewis will later clarify that there ""is laughter and laughter. That of true satire is as it were tragic laughter"". Kreisler, a violent German Romantic of protean energy and a failure as an artist, is in many ways the focus of the novel. An indication of the extremity of his vivid portrait is Lewis' own wondering several years later if he had, in Kreisler, anticipated the personality of Hitler."
"The American first edition used a punctuation mark (resembling an equals sign: '=') between sentences (after full stops, exclamation marks or question marks; in the earlier ""Egoist"" version it had been an m-dash). It has been claimed that these were an attempt by Lewis, an artist, to introduce 'painterly strokes' into literature. This has, however, been disputed by Dr. John Constable, who believes that they are nothing more than a German punctuation mark briefly adopted by Lewis. Lewis himself wrote to Ezra Pound about this when reconstructing missing parts of the manuscript for the U.S. edition: ""Were those parallel lines = Quinn mentions kept going by the Egoist, or not? Could not they be disinterred, & used by Knopf?"" (Lewis to Pound, October 1917). Evidently not all were disinterred, as large stretches of the book as published are without them."
"Both the 1918 and 1928 versions of the novel have been in and out of print since its original publication. Oxford University Press has reissued the 1928 text, edited and with notes by Scott W. Klein of Wake Forest University, as part of its Oxford World Classics paperback series in 2010."

"Bryan Keith Cox (born February 17, 1968) is an American football coach and former player. His most recent position was as the defensive line coach for the Atlanta Falcons of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for Western Illinois University, a small college football program, but received attention for his aggressive style of play. Although Cox was a relatively late fifth-round pick by the Miami Dolphins in the 1991 NFL Draft, he rose to prominence as a standout linebacker during his twelve NFL seasons from 1991 through 2002. He was a three-time pro bowler with the Miami Dolphins, and was also a member of the New England Patriots club that won Super Bowl XXXVI."
"Cox was a member of the East St. Louis High School Flyers high school football team, where he was coached by Bob Shannon."
"Cox attended Western Illinois University and was a mass communications major and a letterman in football. In football, he was a four-year letterman and a two-year starter. As a senior, he was named as a first-team All-America selection by the ""Football Gazette"" and was a first-team all-conference selection. As a junior, he was named the Western Illinois Most Valuable Player. As a sophomore, Cox played in every game, and finished his sophomore season with 54 tackles, four forced fumbles, three fumble recoveries, two interceptions and three blocked kicks. As a freshman, Cox was a reserve nickel-back and finished the season with 30 tackles."
"Cox was drafted by the Dolphins in the fifth round of the 1991 NFL Draft, chosen 113th overall. As a rookie, Cox started 13 games as the Dolphins right outside linebacker, racking up a total of 61 tackles along with two sacks. Miami finished out the season 8-8. In his sophomore campaign, Cox blossomed and helped lead the Dolphins to an 11-5 record and the AFC Championship Game. He made his first Pro Bowl and was named to the All Pro team after recording 127 tackles, 14 sacks and five forced fumbles. Miami switched to a 4-3 defense in 1993 and Cox was moved to right linebacker. The team started out 9-2, but lost their last five to miss the playoffs. Cox again led the team with 122 tackles, four forced fumbles and four fumble recoveries. He also collected five sacks and an interception."
"Cox earned his second Pro Bowl selection in 1994, starting 16 games at middle linebacker, leading the team with 100 tackles. Miami finished the season 10-6, winning the Wild Card Game against the Kansas City Chiefs, 27-17 before losing the Divisional Playoff to the San Diego Chargers, 22-21. In 1995, Cox was selected to his second consecutive Pro Bowl, and third overall. He again started every game at middle linebacker, finishing the year with a team high 119 tackles, 7.5 sacks and three forced fumbles. The Dolphins went 9-7 before bowing out in the Wild Card Game to the Buffalo Bills, 37-22. The defense tied for the AFC lead by allowing only seven rushing touchdowns. Overall, Cox spent five years with the Dolphins playing both outside and middle linebacker, starting 75 out of a possible 78 games."
"Cox would go on to play seven more seasons in the NFL for the Chicago Bears, New York Jets, New England Patriots, and New Orleans Saints. In a career encompassing 165 games, Cox recorded 764 tackles, tallied 51.5 quarterback sacks, caught four interceptions and forced 22 fumbles. Among his most famous plays was a 27-yard interception-return touchdown against the Patriots in September 1999 while playing with the Jets; another famous play came with the Patriots in September 2001 in a game against the Indianapolis Colts; Cox hit receiver Jerome Pathon in the first quarter, a hit that briefly knocked Pathon out."
"Throughout his NFL career, Cox was easily recognizable on the field due to the unusual headrest- or ""surfboard""-style neck roll he wore and colored to match his uniform jersey."
From 2004-2005 he worked as an analyst for TVG Network. Cox also co-hosted an afternoon drive radio program for Fox Sports Radio in 2006 alongside Chris Myers.
"He was an assistant defensive line coach for the New York Jets for three seasons (2006–08) under Eric Mangini. After Mangini was fired and became the coach of the Cleveland Browns in January 2009, he brought Cox with him, where Cox was the defensive line coach."
"On February 21, 2011, Cox was hired by the Miami Dolphins as their pass rush coach."
"On February 17, 2012, Cox was hired to become a defensive assistant at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He was hired the same day as Bill Sheridan."
"On January 11, 2014, Cox was hired by the Atlanta Falcons as their defensive line coach."
"In the 2016 season, Cox and the Falcons reached Super Bowl LI on February 5, 2017. Against the New England Patriots, the Falcons would fall in a 34–28 overtime defeat."
"On February 8, 2017, the Atlanta Falcons relieved Cox of his duties as the defensive line coach. He is now a football analyst on FS1."

"The phrase ""short, sharp shock"" means ""a quick, severe punishment."" It is an example of alliteration. Although the phrase originated earlier, it was popularised in Gilbert and Sullivan's 1885 comic opera ""The Mikado"", where it appears in the song near the end of Act I, ""I Am So Proud"". It has since been used in popular songs, song titles, literature, as well as in general speech."
"John Conington's 1870 translation of the ""First Satire of Horace"" includes the following lines:"
"In Act I of the 1885 Gilbert and Sullivan opera ""The Mikado"", the Emperor of Japan, having learned that the town of Titipu is behind on its quota of executions, has decreed that at least one beheading must occur immediately. In the dialogue preceding the song, three government officials, Pooh-Bah, Ko-Ko and Pish-Tush, discuss which of them should be beheaded in order to save the town from ""irretrievable ruin"". Pooh-Bah says that although his enormous ""family pride"" would normally prompt him to volunteer for such an important civic duty, he has decided to ""mortify"" his pride, and so he declines this heroic undertaking. He points out that since Ko-Ko is already under sentence of death for the capital crime of flirting, Ko-Ko is the obvious choice to be beheaded."
"The three characters then sing the song ""I Am So Proud"". In the last lines of the song, Pooh-Bah, Ko-Ko and Pish-Tush contemplate ""the sensation"" of the ""short, sharp shock"" caused by being beheaded:"
"The phrase is particularly popular in music. For example, the phrase is used in the song ""Us and Them"" (from Pink Floyd's 1973 album, ""The Dark Side of the Moon"")."
"""Short Sharp Shock"" is also the name of a 1984 album by Chaos UK. It also appears in the title of an album, ""Short Sharp Shocked"", by Michelle Shocked and the EP ""Shortsharpshock"" by Therapy?. Short Sharp Shock is the name of a crossover thrash band from Liverpool, England. The phrase is used in the song ""East Side Beat"" by The Toasters, and in the 1980 song ""Stand Down Margaret"" by The Beat. It can also be found in the lyrics of a Billy Bragg song entitled ""It Says Here"" found on his 1984 album ""Brewing Up with Billy Bragg"" and of a They Might Be Giants song entitled ""Circular Karate Chop"" on their 2013 album ""Nanobots""."
"In literature, the phrase is used in the title of a 1990 fantasy novel, ""A Short, Sharp Shock"" by Kim Stanley Robinson. In the 1996 fantasy novel by Terry Pratchett, ""Feet of Clay"", police commander Sam Vimes is ""all for giving criminals a short, sharp shock"", meaning electrocution."

"John Augustine Donahue (July 13, 1879 – July 19, 1913) was an American Major League Baseball first baseman and catcher with the Pittsburgh Pirates, Milwaukee Brewers / Baltimore Orioles, St. Louis Browns, Chicago White Sox and the Washington Senators between 1900 and 1909. Donahue was born in Springfield, Ohio. He batted and threw left-handed."
"Donahue had his greatest success from 1904 to 1908, after switching to first base for the Chicago White Sox. Donahue's defensive skills were a key to the White Sox' 1906 World Series championship team, and he led American League first basemen in fielding percentage, assists, and putouts for 3 consecutive seasons, from 1905 to 1907. In 1907, Donahue had 1,846 putouts, which is still the major league record for putouts by a first baseman. He also holds the major league single season record for most chances accepted per game with 12.65 in 1907."
"Though known mostly for his fielding, Donahue was also a decent hitter from 1905 to 1907. In 1905, he was among the American League leaders in batting average (.287), on-base percentage (.346), RBIs (76), and stolen bases (32). In 1906, Donahue was among the league leaders in stolen bases (36) and sacrifice hits (36) and was one of only three White Sox starters to bat over .250 for the 1906 World Champion ""Hitless Wonders."" Donahue hit for a .278 average (5-for-18) with 2 doubles, 1 triple and 4 RBI."
"On October 10, 1906, Donahue broke up a World Series no-hit bid by Cubs' pitcher Ed Reulbach with a single in the 7th inning."
"In 1907, Donahue led the league in games played (157) and at bats (609) and was among the leaders in hits (158) and RBIs (68)."
"In Detroit on May 31, 1908, Donahue recorded 21 putouts in a nine-inning game."
"In 9 seasons, Donahue played in 813 games with 731 hits, 319 runs scored, 327 RBIs, 143 stolen bases, 90 doubles, 31 triples, and a .255 batting average."
"Donahue contracted syphilis and died in 1913 at age 34. He was survived by a brother, Pat Donahue, a major league catcher in the years 1908-10."
= = = Hanstead House = = =
"Hanstead House or Hanstead Park is a country house estate in Hertfordshire, England. Hanstead is near Bricket Wood, about three miles from Radlett and five miles from St Albans, within the green belt around London. It forms part of the civil parish of St Stephen, Hertfordshire within St Albans District Council. The park has been a stud, a college, and a corporate training centre, and is now owned by a property development firm. The current building, though in the Georgian style, dates from 1925. The property was mentioned in the Domesday Book."
"The house was built for the Yule family. Sir David Yule (1858–1928) was a Scottish entrepreneur who went into the family business, which was trade with India, then the ""jewel in the crown"" of the British Empire. He was involved with many additional businesses. The ""Oxford Dictionary of National Biography"" judged him ""arguably the most important businessman in India"" and quoted his obituary in ""The Times"" as ""one of the wealthiest men, if not the wealthiest man, in the country""."
"A later owner of the property wrote: ""In 1925 Sir David decided to build for himself a mansion on this 1200 acre [4.9 km²] estate, located only five miles [8 km] from the northwest edge of London. Prior to this he had built a 'modest' two-story house of some 14 rooms to live in during construction of the mansion. It was later to become the guest house."""
"Yule had married his cousin Annie Henrietta, oldest daughter of his uncle Andrew Yule of Calcutta. They had one child, Gladys. He died only three years after the construction of the house, and ""lies buried in an admirably designed carved stone tomb, covered overhead by a stone and wood canopy, enclosed by an ornate iron fence inside a small wooded park, the whole being encircled by another iron fence."" The Mausolea and Monuments Trust says that the sculpture itself is a draped chair with inscription from Kipling's ""Jungle Book"" and a box tomb showing his Indian jute mills and plantations."
"The two women lived the rest of their lives at Hanstead. The new main house became the home of the daughter, while her mother lived in the guest house (see dower house). They were world travellers who reportedly shared an interest in big game hunting and a love of animals. Hanstead House was said to have been adorned by a large stuffed bear which they had killed in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. On the grounds they kept a seal, penguins, and wallabies."
"In 1925 they expanded their interests to the breeding of Arabian horses. The two women used their considerable fortune to build stables, purchase breeding stock, and establish a stud. Despite its relatively late start, Hanstead was soon considered ""second only in importance to"" Crabbet Arabian Stud, whose founders, husband and wife team Wilfrid Scawen Blunt and Lady Anne Blunt, had introduced the breed to England in 1878, and from whom the Yules bought and leased horses. A third stud, Courthouse, was also held up to be of the same level, and the three competed against each other at the annual show at the Roehampton Club"
"Gladys Yule died within a year of Judith Blunt-Lytton (Lady Wentworth), who had inherited Crabbet from her parents and run it for 40 years. The deaths of these two only children, at a time of high inheritance tax, meant that in 1957 a substantial number of British-bred Arabian horses left the country, improving the breed's bloodlines elsewhere. The Hanstead horses were appreciated in the United States and in South Africa."
"Following the death of Gladys Yule in 1957, Hanstead Park was put on the market, where it remained uncared for over a considerable period of time. Many country houses were being demolished at this time."
"In 1959 it was brought to the attention of the American evangelist Herbert W. Armstrong, who had arrived in England looking for a larger office for the British branch of his Radio Church of God. He bought the house and land as the site for his second Ambassador College campus. By the time of the purchase the guest house had already been sold separately to another buyer, who used the property as a private home like an island within the campus. Armstrong wrote in Chapter 72 of his autobiography that Trans World Airlines (TWA) had been considering Hanstead House as a school for stewardesses. ""Yet this mansion, with these outstanding gardens, the aviary, greenhouses, cedars of Lebanon, all finally came to us for £8,000 ($22,800) - the not uncommon price of a five- or six-room cottage on a forty- or fifty-foot lot in America, - and that on terms that gave us several years to pay."""
"In 1959 Hanstead House was renamed Memorial Hall in memory of Richard David Armstrong, Herbert's deceased son. The college at Bricket Wood began its first freshman year in 1960. (The first Ambassador College opened in 1947 at Pasadena, California; in 1964 a third college opened in Big Sandy, Texas which for a brief time became Ambassador University. All three colleges have since closed down.) From the radio studio of Ambassador College, daily broadcasts of ""The World Tomorrow"" were heard around the world on hundreds of stations. There was also a sizeable printing establishment on the site. Improvements were made to the grounds: tennis courts, track, gymnasium, and an Olympic standard (imperial measurements) indoor swimming pool."
"When Ambassador College closed its doors in 1974, the sports facilities were sold separately from the main buildings and eventually became part of a sports centre. The pool, one of the most modern in the area, became home to Verulam amateur swimming club in 1979."
"The college became a corporate training centre, first for the Central Electricity Generating Board and then, from 1993, to the banking group HSBC. In 2004 a volunteer-led community woodland was established on land given by the bank; Hanstead Wood has won a Green Flag Award."

"Dinaw Mengestu (born 30 June 1978) is an Ethiopian-American novelist and writer. In addition to three novels, he has written for ""Rolling Stone"" on the war in Darfur, and for ""Jane Magazine"" on the conflict in northern Uganda. His writing has also appeared in ""Harper's"", ""The Wall Street Journal"", and numerous other publications. He is the Program Director of Written Arts at Bard College. In 2007 the National Book Foundation named him a ""5 under 35"" honoree. Since his first book was published in 2007, he has received numerous literary awards, and was selected as a MacArthur Fellow in 2012."
"Dinaw Mengestu was born in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. In 1978, during a period of political repression that became known as the Red Terror, his father, who was an executive with Ethiopian Airlines, applied for political asylum while on a business trip in Italy; Mengestu's mother was pregnant with him at the time. Two years later, when Mengestu was a toddler, he, his mother and his sister were reunited with his father in the United States. The family settled in Peoria, Illinois, where Mengestu's father at first worked as a factory laborer, before rising to a management position. Later the family moved to the Chicago area, where Mengestu graduated from Fenwick High School in Oak Park, Illinois."
"Mengestu received his B.A. in English from Georgetown University, and his MFA in writing from Columbia University in 2005."
"Mengestu's début novel, ""The Beautiful Things That Heaven Bears"", was published in the United States in March 2007 by Penguin Riverhead. It was published in the United Kingdom as ""Children of the Revolution"", issued in May 2007 by Jonathan Cape. It tells the story of Sepha Stephanos, who fled the warfare of the Ethiopian Revolution 17 years before and immigrated to the United States. He owns and runs a failing grocery store in Logan Circle, then a poor African-American section of Washington, D.C. that is becoming gentrified. He and two fellow African immigrants, all of them single, deal with feelings of isolation and nostalgia for home. Stephanos becomes involved with a white woman and her daughter, who move into a renovated house in the neighborhood."
"Mengestu's second novel, ""How to Read the Air"", was published in October 2010. Part of the novel was excerpted in the July 12, 2010, issue of ""The New Yorker"", after Mengestu was selected as one of their ""20 under 40"" writers of 2010. This novel was also the winner of the 2011 Ernest J. Gaines Award for Literary Excellence. This literary award was established in 2007 by the Baton Rouge Area Foundation."
Mengestu's first two novels have been translated into more than a dozen languages.

= = = Sphinx (search engine) = = =
Sphinx is a fulltext F/OSS search engine that provides text search functionality to client applications.
"Sphinx can be used either as a stand-alone server or as a storage engine (""SphinxSE"") for the MySQL family of databases."
"When run as a standalone server Sphinx operates similar to a DBMS and can communicate with MySQL, MariaDB and PostgreSQL through their native protocols or with any ODBC-compliant DBMS via ODBC."
"MariaDB, a fork of MySQL, is distributed with SphinxSE."
"If Sphinx is run as a stand-alone server, it is possible to use SphinxAPI to connect an application to it. Official implementations of the API are available for PHP, Java, Perl, Ruby and Python languages. Unofficial implementations for other languages, as well as various third party plugins and modules are also available. Other data sources can be indexed via pipe in a custom XML format."
"The Sphinx search daemon supports the MySQL binary network protocol and can be accessed with the regular MySQL API and/or clients. Sphinx supports a subset of SQL known as SphinxQL. It supports standard querying of all index types with SELECT, modifying RealTime indexes with INSERT, REPLACE, and DELETE, and more."
"Sphinx can also provide a special storage engine for MariaDB and MySQL databases. This allows those MySQL, MariaDB to communicate with Sphinx's codice_1 to run queries and obtain results. Sphinx indices are treated like regular SQL tables."
"Sphinx is configured to examine a data set via its Indexer. The Indexer process creates a full-text index (a special data structure that enables quick keyword searches) from the given data/text. Full-text fields are the resulting content that is indexed by Sphinx; they can be (quickly) searched for keywords. Fields are named, and you can limit your searches to a single field (e.g. search through ""title"" only) or a subset of fields (e.g. to ""title"" and ""abstract"" only). Sphinx's index format generally supports up to 256 fields. Note that the original data is not stored in the Sphinx index, but are discarded during the Indexing process; Sphinx assumes that you store those contents elsewhere."
Attributes are additional values associated with each document that can be used to perform additional filtering and sorting during search. Attributes are named. Attribute names are case insensitive. Attributes are not full-text indexed; they are stored in the index as is. Currently supported attribute types are:
(since 1.10-beta);
(since 2.1.1-beta);
"Sphinx, like classic SQL databases, works with a so-called fixed schema, that is, a set of predefined attribute columns. These work well when most of the data stored actually has values: mapping sparse data to static columns can be cumbersome. Assume for example that you’re running a price comparison or an auction site with many different products categories. Some of the attributes like the price or the vendor are identical across all goods. But from there, for laptops, you also need to store the weight, screen size, HDD type, RAM size, etc. And, say, for shovels, you probably want to store the color, the handle length, and so on. So it’s manageable across a single category, but all the distinct fields that you need for all the goods across all the categories are legion. The JSON field can be used to overcome this. Inside the JSON attribute you don’t need a fixed structure. You can have various keys which may or may not be present in all documents. When you try to filter on one of these keys, Sphinx will ignore documents that don’t have the key in the JSON attribute and will work only with those documents that have it."

"Mysterious Traveller is the fourth studio album by the jazz ensemble Weather Report and was released in 1974. This was their final recording with founding bassist Miroslav Vitouš, who left due to creative differences. Vitouš was replaced by Alphonso Johnson. Another addition to the line-up is drummer Ishmael Wilburn. Greg Errico was the drummer for the tour between the previously released ""Sweetnighter"" and this album, but declined an invitation to be a permanent member of the band."
"The record is the band's first that predominantly uses electric bass and incorporates liberal uses of funk, R&B grooves, and rock that would later be hallmarked as the band's ""signature"" sound. Also, the more restricted compositional format became evident on this album, replacing the more ""open improvisation"" formats used on the first three albums. It was voted as the album of the year by the readers of ""Down Beat"" for 1974, garnering Weather Report's second overall win in that category, also garnering a five-star review from that publication along the way."
"The album peaked at #2 in the ""Billboard"" Jazz album chart, #31 in the R&B album chart, and #46 in the ""Billboard"" 200 chart."
"Early copies of the album do not list ""Cucumber Slumber"" on the back cover or inner sleeve, and list ""Jungle Book"" as the final track of side one rather than side two. However, most known copies of the album include the seven tracks in the order listed above. One exception is the cassette release, with ""Blackthorn Rose"" as the second track of side one and ""American Tango"" as the second track of side two."
"The Mastersound SBM edition of ""Mysterious Traveller"" includes a previously unreleased song, ""Miroslav's Tune"", as a bonus track at the end of the album."

"It is given a Wythoff symbol, 3/2 3 | 5, but that construction represents a double covering of this model."
It is a hemipolyhedron with its six decagonal faces passing through the model center.

= = = Maria Taferl = = =
"Maria Taferl is an Austrian market municipality of 872 people in the District of Melk and the most important pilgrimage site in all of Lower Austria. After Mariazell, Maria Taferl is the most important pilgrimage destination in all of Austria."
"Maria Taferl is located in the Nibelungengau in Lower Austria on a bank over the Danube. 47.48 percent of the municipality is forested. As the Maria Taferl Market, which takes place on the so-called ""Taferlberg"" (""Taferl Mountain""), the remaining districts are found in the hilly surrounding area. To the south, the basilica is widely visible throughout the town."
"Little is known about the early settlement of Maria Taferl. The Celtic Kingdom of Noricum was located on the northern shore of the Danube. During Roman times, the Danube served as the border of the Province of Noricum. Even today in the church plaza, there is a stone of Celtic origin, on which heathen sacrifices were made. This attests to Maria Taferl's long tradition as a place of religious activity."
"Maria Taferl and the surrounding countryside belonged to the territory of the Ostarrichi during the time of the Bambergs in the Middle Ages. It then became part of the Habsburg holdings. For a long time, it was part of the land of the Lords of Weißenberg, whose seat lay in the nearby town of Münichreith. It is assumed that the various districts of the town were already established during the Middle Ages. The history of the modern market of Maria Taferl begins in the 17th century."
"The first church was built around a shrine to the Holy Mother, which is the origin of the name ""Maria Taferl."" The legends say that the statue of the Pietà at the shrine was an offering from Alexander Schinagel, a forester, who had a miraculous recovery from a serious illness. It replaced a crucifix there, which had also been the site of a miracle, for when local shepherd Thomas Pachmann tried to chop down the oak on which it was placed, he gravely injured both his legs. After a prayer to the Virgin Mary, his almost fatal wounds stopped bleeding. The old oak was destroyed by fire in 1755, which also damaged the statue."
The church building was built from 1660 to 1710. Its construction was begun under the imperial architect Georg Gerstenbrand and the Italian Carlo Lurago. Its famous cupola was built by Jakob Prandtauer from 1708 to 1710. He also designed the current appearance of Melk Abbey. The Maria Taferl church is built in the baroque style with ample amounts of gold leaf and a frescoed ceiling. In the center of the high altar is the namesake Marian stature. The building's rear houses its crypt.
"According to an inscription in the building's interior, the building of the church gave the local inhabitants new courage after the Plague, the Turkish Wars, and the Thirty Years' War had all taken their toll. It also supported the ideas of the Counter-Reformation in the heartland of the Catholic House of Habsburg. All this speaks to Maria Taferl as an important manifestation of the Catholic faith on the main traveling route of the Danube."
"There are many traditional stories of angelic processions here, which come from the 17th century. The tradition of pilgrimage to Maria Taferl also dates back to that time. In 1760 alone, there were 700 pilgrimage processions and over 19,000 masses said there. The church is also a kind of information treasure chest about its pilgrims, their origins, and their number. Within it are the gifts of the pilgrims, who came on account of illness and were cured. Another reason for Maria Taferl's importance as a pilgrimage destination was the stone cross, a gift from the citizens of Freistadt for pilgrims who died on the journey. It is also evidence of the exhausting nature of pilgrimage in those days. The murdered Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his family lived in the nearby Artstetten Castle and is known to have regularly attended mass at Maria Taferl."
"Maria Taferl became a ""Basilica minor"" in 1947."
"By 2010, the basilica's interior should have undergone a complete restoration. It will then celebrate a double jubilee: 350 years since the laying of its cornerstone in 1660, and 300 years since its completion in 1710. The interior's last restoration was around 50 ago; the exterior was restored in 1982, and in 1998, the domes of the two towers were re-covered."
"Besides the basilica, in Maria Taferl there is also a monument for the Fallen of both World Wars. These men are honored annually at meeting of veteran's groups."
There is a folk belief that the water from the well at Maria Taferl can help with eye complaints.
"Other landmarks in the town are the Elementary School Museum, as well as the mechanical nativity, which tells the story of Maria Taferl's origins."
The municipality of Maria Taferl is divided into seven districts:
The mayor of Maria Taferl is Herbert Gruber and the Chief Officer is Daniela Lahmer. In the Municipal Council the 15 seats went to the following parties: ÖVP 10 and SPÖ 5.
"After agriculture, tourism is the most important economic activity in Maria Taferl."
"WPBF presently broadcasts 39½ hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with six hours each weekday, five hours on Saturdays and 4½ hours on Sundays)."
"Initially, WPBF had a small news department as it did not plan to launch one until after it received the ABC affiliation. After being purchased by Paxson Communications, the station added additional newscasts to its schedule. For a long time they struggled with ratings in their own market, which is attributable to WPLG's very strong over-the-air signal in Palm Beach County and its availability on Comcast throughout the area. However with Hearst's traditional hard news focus on their stations soon instituted within WPBF's news operation, WPBF eventually became a spirited second place news operation, and WPBF usually outranks WPEC currently in most timeslots (NBC affiliate WPTV has been well dominant in the market for years)."
"On July 12, 2006, it started airing a half-hour newscast called ""Weather First at 4"" on weekdays becoming the first station in West Palm Beach to do so. While the main intention of the new broadcast was to cover West Palm Beach area weather, news updates and headlines were added after a short time. This production is streamed live on their website. On July 17, 2006, WPBF added thirty minutes to its weekday morning show which began airing at 5:30. It became a full two-hour broadcast on January 28, 2008. The station debuted a new traffic reporting system featuring data from Traffic.com on February 14 that included a new traffic segment, ""Beat the Traffic"", seen on weekdays."
"Expansion of local news continued with the launch of a weekend morning newscast on March 8. On August 18, 2008, WPBF began broadcasting a broadcast at noon during the week which is also streamed live on its website. On September 14, 2009, the station debuted a new logo, set, and graphics package while expanding the 4 p.m. newscast to an hour. WPBF dropped weeknight newscasts in the 5 p.m. hour to make room for ""Dr. Phil"" which had moved to the station from WPTV; that change has since been reverted, for as of September 12, 2011, ""The Dr. Oz Show"" replaced the 4 p.m. newscast."
"Until October 4, 2010, WPBF was the only channel in the West Palm Beach market that did not offer newscasts in high definition or even enhanced definition widescreen. However, WPBF was operating HD-ready studios and field cameras for its broadcasts. The shows were displayed in pillarboxed standard definition while showing the station's logo and ""HD"" in the left and right thirds of the screen. On October 4 starting with the weeknight 4 p.m. newscast, WPBF started broadcasting local news in high definition. Upon the upgrade, it began using an updated music package and slightly revised HD graphics previously used by sister station WESH in Orlando. In December 2012, WPBF upgraded their graphics package to the new Hearst Television graphics along with new music and talent opens. However, like another sister station, KSBW in Salinas, California, HD is not mentioned in the news openings. WPBF will also continue to display HD in the left and right thirds of the screen when video footage is shown in 4:3 standard definition. The station does not currently operate a sports department which is unusual for both a big three network channel and a Hearst-owned station."

"Marjorie Celeste Champion (née Belcher; born September 2, 1919) is an American dancer and actress. At a young age, she was hired as a dance model for Walt Disney Studios animated films. Later, she performed as an actress and dancer in film musicals, and in 1957 had a TV show based on song and dance. She has also done creative choreography for liturgy, and served as a dialogue and movement coach for the 1978 TV miniseries, ""The Awakening Land"", set in the late 18th century in the Ohio Valley."
"Marge Champion was born as Marjorie Celeste Belcher on September 2, 1919, in Los Angeles, California, to Hollywood dance director Ernest Belcher and his wife, Gladys Lee Baskette (née Rosenberg). She had an older half sister, Lina Basquette, who already was acting in silent films at the age of twelve. Lina was the daughter of her mother's first husband, Frank Baskette, who had committed suicide."
"Marjorie began dancing at an early age as her sister had done. She began dancing as a child under the instruction of her father, Ernest Belcher, a noted Hollywood ballet coach who trained Shirley Temple, Cyd Charisse, and Gwen Verdon. She studied exclusively with her father from age five until she left for New York. She credits her good health and long career to her father's teaching principles: careful, strict progression of activity, emphasis on correct alignment, precise placement of body, attention to detail and to the totality of dynamics and phrasing. Her first dance partner was Louis Hightower. In 1930, she made her debut in the Hollywood Bowl at age 11 in the ballet ""Carnival in Venice"". By age twelve, she became a ballet instructor at her father's studio. She was hired by The Walt Disney Studio as a dance model for their animated film ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" (1937). Her movements were copied to enhance the realism of the animated Snow White figure."
"In 1937, Marge Belcher married Art Babbitt (1907–1992), a top animator at Disney and creator of Goofy. They divorced in 1940."
"In 1947, she married dancer Gower Champion (1919–1980). They had two sons, Blake and actor Gregg Champion. They divorced in January 1973. Belcher met Gower when she was 12 years old in the ninth grade at Bancroft Junior High and that's when their romance started. Although performances often took them away from California, Los Angeles remained their home base."
"In 1977, she married director Boris Sagal. Sagal was killed on May 22, 1981, in an accident during the production of the miniseries ""World War III"". She became stepmother to Boris' five children, who include Katey, Jean, Liz, and Joey."
"The very first picture Belcher remembers being in was ""The Castles"" with Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. This gave her a feeling that she would really like to do movies but what she really wanted to do was go to New York and be in New York shows. Sadly, Belcher wasn't tall enough not even for ballet, which is what she trained all her life for."
"Together as a dance team, the Champions performed in MGM musicals of the 1940s and 50s, including their first MGM musical ""Till the Clouds Roll By"" (1946), ""Show Boat"" (1951) and ""Everything I Have Is Yours"" (1952). Other films with Gower included ""Mr. Music"" (1950, with Bing Crosby), ""Give a Girl a Break"" (1953), ""Jupiter's Darling"" (1955), and ""Three for the Show"" (1955). MGM wanted the couple to remake Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers films, but only one, ""Lovely to Look At"" (1952), a remake of ""Roberta"" (1935), was completed. The couple refused to remake any of the others, the rights to which were still owned by RKO."
"Gower and Marge Champion appeared as the Mystery Guests on the May 15, 1955 airing of ""What's My Line"". Mary Healy guessed who they were."
"During the summer of 1957, the Champions had their own TV series, ""The Marge and Gower Champion Show"", a situation comedy with song and dance numbers. Marge played a dancer and Gower a choreographer. Real-life drummer Buddy Rich was featured as a fictional drummer named Cozy."
"In the 1970s, Champion, actress Marilee Zdenek, and choreographer John West were part of a team at Bel Aire Presbyterian Church that created a number of creative worship services featuring dance and music. They later offered workshops and related liturgical arts programs throughout the country. She and Zdenek co-authored two books, ""Catch the New Wind"" and ""God Is a Verb"", related to this work."
"In 1978 she served as a dialogue and movement coach for the TV miniseries, ""The Awakening Land"", adapted from Conrad Richter's trilogy of the same name. It was set in the late 18th-century Ohio Valley."
"Champion has also worked as a dance instructor and choreographer in New York City. In 1982, she made a rare television acting appearance on the dramatic TV series ""Fame"", playing a ballet teacher with a racial bias against African-American students."
"Champion appeared in several stage musicals and plays on Broadway as a performer. She made her New York debut in ""What's Up"" (1943). She also performed in the ""Dark of the Moon"" (1945) as the Fair Witch, and ""Beggar's Holiday"" (1946) having multiple roles. She made her last Broadway appearance in ""3 for Tonight"" in 1955. She also worked as a choreographer or Assistant, including ""Lend an Ear"" in 1948 as assistant to the Choreographer; ""Make a Wish"" in 1951, as assistant to Gower Champion; ""Hello, Dolly!"" in 1964 as special assistant; and ""Stepping Out"" (1987) as choreographic associate. In 2001, she appeared as Emily Whitman in the Broadway stage revival of ""Follies""."
"Champion states ""as a dancer, by the time you're 40 you're done. If I ever come back, I want to be an actress- it lasts long. But I was 81 when I was in ""Follies""."
"Marge Champion has been interviewed in numerous documentaries, including for the behind-the-scenes documentary directed by Oscar-winner Chris Innis, ""The Story of the Swimmer"", which was featured on the 2014 Grindhouse Releasing/Box Office Spectaculars Blu-ray/DVD restoration of ""The Swimmer"". She was also interviewed at a Hollywood film festival screening of ""The Swimmer"" by filmmaker Allison Anders for the same release.

When all of the leaders were there, about 460 in number, Hengest ordered his men to draw their long knives and kill every leader. Vortigern was spared, but every other ruler was slain, save Eldol, who grabbed a stick up off the ground and killed 70 men in his escape."
"After the massacre, Eldol was a key supporter of Aurelius Ambrosius and helped him defeat the Saxons. Eldol defeated Hengist in hand-to-hand combat at the battle at Kaerconan/Cunungeburc, which may be the town of Conisbrough, and beheaded him. He was also at the siege of Vortigern's tower. Eldad, Bishop of Gloucester, was his brother."
"Thomas Rudge gives an account in his 1811 ""The History and Antiquities of Gloucester"":"
"Eldol, or Edel, a Briton, is said to have been Earl of Gloucester in 461; he was, according to the account of Robert of Gloucester, and other historians, a knight of great prowess. He attended King Vortigern at the treaty of Ambresbury in Wiltshire, to which they were invited by Hengist, the Saxon, with the express stipulation that neither party should go thither armed; but the Saxons having, contrary to their engagement, concealed long knives under their clothes, murdered great numbers of the Britons. Eldol is said at this time to have exerted himself so powerfully with a stake he happened to find, as to slay no less than seventy of the Saxons, and after having disabled many more, he escaped to Gloucester, his own city. He is also said to have behaved with uncommon courage, in a subsequent battle between Ambrosius, King of the Britons, and Hengist, when ... he rushed through the Pagan army, took Hengist prisoner, and cut off his head."
"It is not stated whether Morvid, Consul of Gloucester during King Arthur's reign in the ""Historia Regum Britanniae"", is related to Eldol."
"In later Welsh legend, Eldol became Eidol or Eidiol 'Gadarn' ('Mighty'), recorded as one of the three strong men of Britain, having, at the meeting on Salisbury plain, slain 660 Saxons with a billet of wood."
"There was a Welsh hero Eidiol mentioned in ""The Gododdin"" who may have inspired the use of the name in Geoffrey's work."
He should not be confused with King Eldol who lives generations earlier in Geoffrey's work.
"Eldol and Eldad have minor roles in the 1970 novel ""The Crystal Cave"" by Mary Stewart. After the battle with Hengist, one of Ambrosius's men says to Merlin, ""... old Eldad laid about him [i.e., fought well] with the best of them. Did you see him?"" Merlin replies wryly, ""I heard him."""

"Yidl Mitn Fidl (, ""Yiddle With His Fiddle"", ), is a 1936 musical Yiddish film."
"Arye and his daughter Itke are musicians, or ""klezmorim"", who became impoverished and were evicted from their home in Kazimierz Dolny. Arie sees no choice but to embark on a career of a travelling band, but fears for the safety of his daughter on the dangerous roads. Itke solves the problem by disguising herself as a boy and adopts the persona of ""Yidl"", ostensibly Arie's son."
"During their voyages, they meet another pair of merrymakers, the father-and-son duo Isaac and Ephraim Kalamutker, with whom they form a quartet and roam through the Polish countryside seeking engagements. ""Yidl"" falls in love with Ephraim, who is utterly oblivious to the true sex of his companion. The four are hired to perform in the wedding of young Teibele to the old, rich man Zalman Gold. The bride had to cancel her prior engagement with her true love, Yosl Fedlman, for her late father left many unpaid debts. Yidl takes pity on Teibele and the quartet smuggle her out of the party and have her join them as vocalist. To Yidl's dismay, Ephraim is enamored with the young woman. Itke reveals her true self to Isaac, who determines to assist her and leaves to locate Yosl."
"When arriving in Warsaw, the group become a success and are hired to perform in a concert. However, personal tensions between the members run high. Efraim signs a contract with a local orchestra. Teibele's lost match finally arrives, and they run off together before the show. Yidl, quite by accident, takes her place and recounts her entire story and love for Efraim in song form. She is applauded and signed on a contract for a career in the United States. Having learned the truth, Efraim abandons his commitments and joins her on the ship to New York."
"After the success of ""Joseph in the Land of Egypt"", a silent film dubbed into the Yiddish language by Joseph Green, met with success, he decided to create an entirely Yiddish film, and returned to his native Poland to do so. ""Yidl Mitn Fidl"" was the most successful Yiddish film of all time and the most popular of Green's films as well."
"The film was shot on location in Kazimierz Dolny, Poland, with local inhabitants as extras. Based on a novella by Konrad Tom, the screenplay was written by Green. Its score was composed by Abraham Ellstein, and the lyrics to the songs were written by Itzik Manger. Jakob Jonilowicz was the photo director of the film."
"It was filmed in Poland to minimize costs: the total budget was $50,000. Picon was contemplating entering English-language entertainment and had to be paid an astronomical fee in terms of Yiddish cinema, $10,000 or a fifth of the entire expenditure, to star in the main role. Besides her, all actors were Polish. The film turned into a resounding commercial success and covered the producers' expenses even before opening in the United States. When it premiered in the Ambassador movie theatre, Frank S. Nugent wrote in the ""New York Times"": ""It must be set down to her credit that, despite the fact that there is not a single new thing in the whole bag of tricks emptied on the screen, Miss Picon puts so much infectious gayety, not forgetting the proper modicum of sadness, into the action that the result is genuine entertainment."" It was exported to most of Western Europe, Australia and South Africa, and was screened in the British Mandate of Palestine with Hebrew dubbing. In Britain, it opened at Academy Cinema, Oxford Street, on 21 July 1937. The picture was exported outside of London and was quite a success; In a review for ""Night and Day"" from 29 July 1937, Graham Greene wrote of ""Yiddle"": ""a story in which even the music seems to have the dignity and patina of age and race. An odd feeling of freedom pervades the film full of ugly people in bowler-hats strumming in courtyards... Freedom even from the closer tyranny of a well-made script, as if the whole picture were an impromptu performance, like the stories in the Decameron."" Several copies were sent to Nazi Germany, where Jews were not allowed to attend regular cinemas, and viewing was restricted to ""members of the Jewish Race."" Premiere in the hall of the Jüdischer Kulturbund took place on 2 May 1938, and it then ran in communities across Germany."
"In 1956, a remastered version, fully dubbed into English, was released in New York for a short run, bearing the title ""Castles in the Sky."""

"Sounds like Chicken also had rotation on the radio station Triple J, mainly with their double A-side single ""Take a Bullet to the Grave""/""El Chupanebre"" and their other single ""Global Domination""."
"After their breakup, SLC released all their previous recordings under Creative Commons (by-nc-sa), for free online distribution."
The band reformed for a once-off show on 11 May 2014 as a benefit for independent record store Fist2face.
"Sounds Like Chicken began in 1999 when Nathanael Kitingan (Nat Kitingan) met Nyall Dawson at Monash University in Melbourne. Nat and Nyall attempted to start an unnamed musical project with Hugh Ogilvy (also from Monash University) featuring Nyall on electric violin, Hugh on guitar and Nat on drums. This trio did not get off the ground and so brothers Joel and Elliot Dawson joined to form Sounds Like Chicken, a ska project taking influences from Voodoo Glow Skulls, The O.C. Supertones, The Insyderz and Five Iron Frenzy. This early lineup was Nyall (vocals), Nat (bass/vocals), Elliot (drums), Joel (sax) and Hugh (guitar)."
"Sounds Like Chicken's first show was at Joel's 21st birthday party in mid-2000. Hugh left the band at the end of 2000 due to other commitments and was replaced by Tom Dowding on guitar. Tom was an extremely accomplished bass player and so Nat decided to swap to playing guitar so that Tom's talent could be fully utilised. The band decided they needed another horn and so after a number of unsuccessful audition attempts, in 2001 Nat met Natalie Parker at university and invited her to a practice. Natalie was initially apprehensive but was eventually convinced by the boys to join the band. During her second practice she was already laying down trumpet tracks on their first demo recording which ended up becoming the band's self-made demo EP, ""Slowly Going the Way of the Chicken""."
"Sounds Like Chicken toured interstate for the first time under this lineup in September 2001, playing in Sydney and Canberra and also at the Black Stump Music Festival. In 2002, Tom Dowding departed from Sounds like Chicken to be replaced by Joshua Diemar on bass. It was in this year that Sounds Like Chicken released their first studio EP, ""I Am Gibbon, Hear Me Roar"", produced by David Carr (Antiskeptic, Taxiride). The EP gave the band airplay on community radio, Christian radio, and Triple J."
"In early 2004, the band were signed to Boomtown Records, a Melbourne-based indie record label distributing through Shock Records and MGM. Deciding that a bigger ensemble was required, Sounds Like Chicken asked long-time friend Dave Powys (ex Staff Discount and Never In Doubt) to join on second guitar, making them a 7-piece band. Dave moved down from Canberra and recorded on the single Global Domination, their first release with Boomtown and distributed through MGM. The single received national airplay and spot airplay on Triple J and was sold out within 2 months of its limited pressing. It was noted that producer Dave Carr's production was a big step up from previous releases."
"It was shortly after this that the band decided it was time to move on and the band was without a bass-player. They were booked in to record an album and so asked if Carlos Echeverria (ex Know Exit and Wishful Thinking) would fill in and record bass for them. Their first full-length album, ""...Like a Cannonball to the Ocean Floor"" was released late that year through Boomtown, also doing well on the airwaves. The album drew acclaim from reviewers as a ""brilliantly released debut album"", although the length of 17 tracks drew some criticism. Sounds Like Chicken did a joint national tour with label-mates Wishful Thinking to launch the album. Carlos officially joined shortly after the album's release."
"In early 2005 founding member and manager, Elliot, decided to part ways with the band. Mike ""Carcass"" Haydon (of Melbourne band ""The Knockabouts""), only 17 at the time, was able to fill the role of drummer. Mike had been a tour roadie for the band for the past 3 years and so was already well-acquainted with their songs. That year Sounds Like Chicken released the second double-A side single off the album, ""Take a Bullet to the Grave/El Chupanebre"" through Boomtown Records, and completed a national tour over 3 months to launch it."
"On 3 November 2006, founding member, Nyall Dawson, announced his decision to depart the band early in 2007."
Sounds Like Chicken have played and toured with numerous well-known Australian and international acts and have been featured on various international and Australian compilations and soundtracks such as Turn the Other Cheek Volume 1.
"On 18 December 2006 Sounds Like Chicken announced they were calling it a day in a bulletin released on the band's MySpace. The main factors in the breakup was the future departure of Nyall Dawson and other key members of the band, the band stated..."
"""""We guess it’s time for some of us to move on. There was other plans for our lives and with the impending departure of some key members, we felt that SLC would simply not be SLC if we went on without them. We all feel at peace about this decision."""""
"Shortly after, the band announced plans for an Australia wide farewell tour to take place in February–March 2007, along with the release of a final limited-edition compilation disk titled ""Death To The Crow"" to coincide with the tour."
"Sounds Like Chicken's final show was held at TLC Bayswater, Victoria on Saturday 17 March 2007."
The band's entire discography (except for Death To The Crow) was made available for free download on their website and on Jamendo
"In April 2007, former SLC members Mike Haydon, Dave Powys, Ben Hobson, Nat Kitingan and Joel Dawson together with new addition Paul McCasker formed reggae band San Salvador. They released an EP ""How To Hear"", two singles ""Like a Train"" and ""Spark the Fire"" and later the mini-album ""Rugged Are The Mountains""."
Former members Mike Haydon and Joe Ireland later joined indie band The Middle East which featured two tracks in Triple J's hottest 100 in 2010. Dave Powys also went on to join indie folk band The Paper Kites.
"On 31 March 2014 it was announced on the band's fan-run Facebook page that they were reforming for a once off show on 11 May 2014 as a benefit for Fist2face record store. The show was held at Ding Dong Lounge and featured supports from Antiskeptic, The Ramshackle Army, Best Before, Payoff and more. The show sold out."
= = = Full Scale (band) = = =
"Full Scale (formerly known as Full Scale Deflection, later known as Full Scale Revolution) is an Australian alternative metal band that formed in Perth, Western Australia during 1998. The band relocated to Melbourne in 2001."
"Full Scale released two extended plays; ""Black Arrows"" and ""White Arrows"" both in 2003 on Popstar Records. They also released a self-titled studio album issued in 2005 on Columbia Records, ""Full Scale""."
"Full Scale were formed in 1998 in Perth as Full Scale Deflection. By 1999, they consisted of Ezekiel the Ox on lead vocals, Nic Frey on drums, Chris Frey on bass guitar, Forrester Savell on synthesiser, and Jimmy Tee on guitar. Matt Crute (aka Crutey) soon replaced Nic Frey on drums. Rob Kaay replaced Chris Frey on bass guitar by 2000. They released the album, ""Symptoms of Chaos"", on 11 November 2000. The band dropped the word Deflection from their name and then moved to Melbourne in 2001. Despite playing their original songs for some of their shows, they developed new music."
"Kaay and Andrew McGuiness (a lawyer) formed a record label, Popstar Records, and Full Scale released their debut extended play, ""Black Arrows"" in March 2003. This was followed by a second EP, ""White Arrows"" in August. There was a brief line-up change; Tee left the band, being replaced by Tristan Ross for about six months. Under the management of Kaay, the band toured the east coast extensively."
"According to Allmusic's reviewer, Johnny Loftus, ""the band's hard-hitting, gristly sound – led by Ox's vocal seethe – caught the interest of American majors"". By the end of the year, Tee rejoined and the band moved to Los Angeles where they were signed to Columbia Records (SonyBMG) and released their self-titled album, ""Full Scale"", on 8 March 2005. After the album's release they toured the United States as the opening act for US rap rock band, Hed PE."
"Upon returning to Australia, Crutey and Tee decided to play one last show with the band and Ben Brennan (Seven, Full Scale Revolution) played his first show with Full Scale on bass guitar at the Corner Hotel in Melbourne on 17 March 2006. Ox moved on to a new group, Mammal."
"In January 2016 Ox and Tee announced that they were reforming the band with a new rhythm section of Chris Webber (Webbsy) and Leigh Miller. They announced February 2016 tour dates in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth."
"The band released a new song entitled ""Jurassic Graveyard"" in January 2018, and embarked on a national tour of Australia. So far, no new album has yet been announced."
"After Full Scale, Ox became the front man for Mammal, from March 2006, they released an EP, ""Mammal"". Their single ""Slaves"" was produced by Ox's ex-bandmate Savell. They later released two albums ("""" and ""The Majority"") and disbanded in 2009. He was the front-man of The Ox & the Fury with Brennan, Lucius Borich and Dom Italiano, as an alternate country music group. Ox also appeared in theatre, and produced music for hip hop groups. Ox later became the front man of Over-Reactor (based in Melbourne), which released their album, ""Lose Your Delusion""."
"Kaay became an author and entrepreneur. He used the business management skills he had acquired to build Full Scale into the band that was signed to Columbia Records to start his own Australian company. Right after Full Scale, he joined Sunk Loto in September 2006, until they broke up in December 2007. After that he worked with the Brown brothers for nearly two years on an unreleased project tentatively entitled, ""The Flood The Flood"". Deciding to retire from the live-music-touring scene in 2008, Kaay released a series of books, ""Robkaay Journals. Vol. I, My Glorious Nightmare"" (2008), based on his recollections of his music career over a period of ten years. Vol. II followed in 2010 as ""This is what it's really like being in a band"". He has also written two fantasy fiction novels, ""Silverbirch: A Tear in the Fabric of the Night Sky""(2009) and Silverbirch: Fall of the Epicenter. His first Silverbirch novel cracked the Top 10 Amazon.com chart in its first week of release in the Science Fiction category. Kaay is now a successful entrepreneur running multiple businesses under his company Kaay.com.au(.)"

"Tyrolit was co-founded on the 13th of February 1919 by Daniel Swarovski to manufacture grinding wheels for the production of Swarovski-Crystals. During World War I, the Swarovski Group was cut off from supplies of grinding wheels and was forced to develop and produce its own grinding wheels. After the war, it was decided to commercialize this activity and to start a separate company: Tyrolit was born."
"In 1950, the company relocated from the Swarovski Headquarters in Wattens to a new location in Schwaz. One of the largest drivers of growth of the company was the market launch of the glass fibre reinforced cut-off and grinding wheel SECUR in 1952. The glass fibre reinforcement greatly improved the security of the tools against centrifugal breakage."
In 1991 Tyrolit acquired the US company Diamond Products and the Swiss company Hydrostress. These acquisitions added significant presence in the market for concrete drilling and sawing systems.
"Further major acquisitions took place in 2004 with the purchasing of the Czech company Carborundum Electrite, in 2009 with the purchasing of the US company Radiac and in 2014 with the purchasing of the South African company Grinding Techniques."
The Tyrolit Group is organized in four divisions:
The Tyrolit Group operates under the following brands:

"Produced by Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert's Ghost House Pictures, Real World Pictures and Roy Lee's Vertigo Entertainment, the film was released on May 22, 2015 by 20th Century Fox and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in the United States.

"Eric and Amy Bowen are a married couple looking to buy a house for themselves and their three children: 16-year-old daughter Kendra (Saxon Sharbino), 9-year-old son Griffin (Kyle Catlett), and 6-year-old daughter Madison (Kennedi Clements). Eric was recently laid off, but they are shown a house that has recently come on the market that fits their price range, so they purchase it and move in."
"The first night, they hear strange noises in the walls and Griffin finds a box containing clown dolls that were left at the house. In the middle of the night, lights and electronic devices start turning on and off, as some unseen force appears to move through the home. The commotion wakes Griffin, and he goes downstairs and finds Maddie talking to an unknown presence inside the television. She tells Griffin someone is coming, and he attempts to unplug the TV, causing the lights to go out of control. Maddie then tells the family: ""They're here"" while touching their TV screen."
"The following evening, Eric and Amy go to dinner with their friends, leaving the three children at home. They learn that their house was built on an old cemetery, although the property developer was supposed to have relocated the human remains. Kendra wakes up to a strange sound in the laundry room. While investigating the noise, the floor cracks and a corpse's hand emerges. It begins pulling at her foot, but she manages to pull herself up. Meanwhile, Griffin notices the clown dolls seem to be moving by themselves. One clown doll attacks him, but he destroys it and runs from his bedroom. He finds Maddie in her room, scared, crouching in a corner, and tells her to stay while he goes to find Kendra. Maddie is then lured into her closet and becomes lost in an unending void. As she sees her bedroom drifting away further, she is dragged into the darkness by ghosts. Griffin is grabbed through a window by the branches of the old tree outside their house, which pulls him outside. Amy and Eric arrive home to see Griffin being tossed around in the tree branches, which releases its grip when they come close, while Kendra tells them she can't find Maddie."
"The family hears Maddie's voice emanating from the television. Amy places her hand on the television screen while Maddie's static hand is seen to be touching Amy's hand from the other side of the screen. Amy and Griffin visit the Paranormal Research department for help. The staff set up equipment in the house and install GPS devices on everyone in the house. While trying to contact Maddie, Eric is ambushed in the closet by a ghost resembling her. Angered, he breaks down the closet wall, throwing a chair into the darkness inside the closet; the chair falls back into the living room of the house, revealing a possible portal Maddie can escape through. The investigators realize that the haunting is a poltergeist. The lead investigator, Dr. Brooke Powell, decides to call occult specialist and television personality Carrigan Burke (revealed, much later, to be Powell's ex)."
"Carrigan explains that Maddie is a possible psychic, able to communicate with spirits. He reveals that the ghosts are trapped and are angry because only the headstones were moved to the new cemetery, but the bodies remain; they plan on using Maddie ""to free them from their purgatory"". Carrigan comes up with a plan to get Maddie back. He anchors a rope in Maddie's room and tosses it into the vortex. They attempt to use Griffin's toy drone to guide Maddie out, but it is immediately destroyed by the ghosts when inside the portal. Griffin, guilt-ridden over leaving Maddie alone in the first place, goes through the portal himself. When he finds Maddie, the ghosts attempt to destroy the rope to trap them, but Griffin and Maddie grab onto the rope and are brought back through the portal."
"The family get in their car and begin to leave the house, but the ghosts drag them back into the house and attempt to abduct Maddie again. The family saves her from being sucked into the portal, and Carrigan decides that as the only other psychic, he must go into the vortex and lead the spirits into the light. The Bowens flee as the house is destroyed by the spirits soaring into the sky as a beacon of light. The investigative team run to their equipment, looking for a sign that Carrigan managed to get back."
"As the Bowens look for a new house, the realtor shows them a house with lots of closet space and an old tree in the backyard; the Bowens drive away laughing. During the end credits, it's revealed that Carrigan survived the incident and is back filming his ghost program, now hosting the show with Dr. Powell."
"In early September 2013, the crew shot interior scenes for the film in an old residence in Toronto. Exterior shots were filmed on the West Mountain of Hamilton. Principal photography began on September 23 and ended on December 13, 2013."
"On August 6, 2014, the film's release date was shifted from February 13, 2015 to July 24, 2015. On March 4, 2015, the date was shifted again to when it was previously set for ""Spy"". It was released in 3D."
"The film's first trailer was released on February 5, 2015. Forrest Wickman of ""Slate Magazine""'s opinion was that the trailer made the film appear to be too similar to the original film. James Hibberd of ""Entertainment Weekly"" said that the trailer ""retains and amplifies several elements from the original"", and praised that ""the modernizing doesn’t result in, say, the family’s daughter being kidnapped by ghosts in Snapchat"". Brad Miska of Bloody Disgusting stated that ""while every fiber of my being wants to reject it, [the film] actually looks pretty insane"", and praised the trailer's final shot. Ben Kuchera of ""Polygon"" also opined that the trailer appeared to be similar to the original film, but that it ""looks great, as a horror movie""."
"""Poltergeist"" was released on DVD Blu-ray Disc and Blu-ray 3D on September 29, 2015. The Blu-ray editions included an extended cut of the film."
"On April 10, 2019, it was announced that the Russo brothers would helm a new remake of the franchise."
"On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 31% based on 129 reviews and an average rating of 4.8/10. The site's consensus reads: ""Paying competent homage without adding anything of real value to the original ""Poltergeist"", this remake proves just as ephemeral (but half as haunting) as its titular spirit."" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 47 out of 100 based on 27 critics, indicating ""mixed or average reviews"". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""C+"" on an A+ to F scale."
"Writing for ""Variety"", Andrew Barker called it ""generally entertaining yet fundamentally unnecessary"" and concluded: ""Even when one is inclined to admire the cleverness with which the remake revisits and reincorporates ""Poltergeist""s themes, it’s hard to pinpoint a single moment where it improves on them, and the aura of inessentiality hangs thick over the proceedings"". Neil Genzlinger gave the film a mostly positive review in ""The New York Times"", writing: ""The new ""Poltergeist"" might well be the scariest movie 13-or-unders have yet seen, just as the original was for their parents back in 1982. Those parents might find it an enjoyable trip down memory lane, even if they do now recognize it as largely a well-served collection of horror-movie tropes"". Eddie Goldberger echoed that sentiment in The New York Daily News, writing ""It doesn't approach the original--really, how could it? But the new ""Poltergeist"" is a fun, worthy horror entry."" Tirdad Derakhshani wrote in ""The Philadelphia Inquirer"": ""It's not exactly a scary film, but it does provide an enjoyable ride. It's good fun. But it left me befuddled"", adding: ""Why would anyone want to remake ""Poltergeist"" in the first place?"". Writing in ""The Daily Telegraph"", Mike McCahill called the film ""an efficient scare-machine"". Bilge Ebiri wrote in ""New York"" magazine: ""This new ""Poltergeist"" isn't anything special... But it's not a travesty, and that feels like cause for brief celebration""."
"Other critics took a more skeptical view of the film. Writing a review for ""The Village Voice"", Alan Scherstuhl stated, """"Poltergeist 2015"" is to ""Poltergeist '82"" what today's shipped-frozen-to-the-store Pizza Hut dough is to the kneaded-on-site pies the chain's stoned cooks tossed in the Reagan era. It's the same kind of thing, with the same shape and some shared ingredients, but the texture's gone limp, and there's no sense of occasion about it, and there's some unpalatable goop stuffed in the crust. In a pinch, it beats pizzalessness — but just barely."" Linda Cook wrote in ""The Quad City Times"", ""The ""Poltergeist"" remake is OK, but won't stay with you."" Randy Cordova in ""The Arizona Republic"" wrote, ""Ultimately, the whole affair is forgettable."""
"""Poltergeist"" grossed $47.4 million in North America and $48.2 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $95.6 million against a budget of an estimated $35 million."
"In North America, ""Poltergeist"" made $1.4 million during its Thursday night showings from 2,500 theaters, and an estimated $9.4 million on its opening day. Through its first three-day opening, it grossed $22.6 million from 3,240 theaters, debuting at fourth place at the box office behind ""Tomorrowland"", ""Pitch Perfect 2"" and """".
