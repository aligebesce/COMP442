And thi and this
All the blokes on the one night on  they used to go in there.
They didn't!
I assure you they did  it's hard  working down there for so long it
Yeah cos he's a nice little man ain't he?
Yeah he's harmless.
Yeah ever so harmless little fellah.
Yeah.
Hard working old boy as well.
What about what Brian said last night?
What?
"About, cos that man was  sitting outside  May ."
Oh May .
"He weren't sitting outside her house at all, he was sitting up here!"
"Yeah well he, didn't go up the sides or something?"
"Oh well he might of done, yeah."
Make our bloody
They're paranoid for  people breaking
Yeah.
in arn't they.
Yeah.
"I was telling Sue  about it, oh my God she said!"
"She said well they didn't look the type, I was going well now"

I said and he's quite and inoffe i inoffensive little man  he was a nice little man.
Bag of nerves weren't he?
"Well yeah, but he was a nice little man."
Yeah.
He knew what he was talking about.

Try the square root of nine.
Just press clear.
"Yeah, I just press this one."
Yes.
Clear that bit.
Cos it clears the whole mind.
Right.
What shall I press?
Nine  square root  is three.
So if you multiply three times three  you get nine.
Now it's easy when you deal in numbers like that because if you go to sixteen
Yes.
the square root is four.
Yes.
And if you go to twenty five the square root is five.
That's the number which multiplied by its self
Right.
gives you the number.
"Now, now it gets difficult when you come to a number like six."
Oh yes.
Try and find the square root of six.
"What do you think, have you an idea of what it will be."
"Don't, don't press the button."
Six.
Er er
"What, what number do you think you'd have to multiply by itself to get six?"
Three.
No.
Three times three is?
"I don six, six."
It's three.
No.
I I didn't mind going

So she's not gonna give me the book?
"Well she might, but you might have to wait till after Christmas for it."

No you might be old enough to be considered you can wait till after Christmas for your present.
Paul I'd like you to do a job.
I've done a job.
I've been round to Merle's.
No.
cried the startled pirates .
"`` The cabin 's as black as a pit , '' Cecco said , almost gibbering , `` but there is something terrible in there : the thing you heard crowing . ''"
"The exultation of the boys , the lowering looks of the pirates , both were seen by Hook ."
"`` Cecco , '' he said in his most steely voice , `` go back and fetch me out that doodle-doo . ''"
"Cecco , bravest of the brave , cowered before his captain , crying `` No , no '' ; but Hook was purring to his claw ."
"`` Did you say you would go , Cecco ? ''"
he said musingly .
"Cecco went , first flinging his arms despairingly ."
"There was no more singing , all listened now ; and again came a death-screech and again a crow ."
No one spoke except Slightly .
"`` Three , '' he said ."
Hook rallied his dogs with a gesture . ''
"'S ` death and odds fish , '' he thundered , `` who is to bring me that doodle-doo ? ''"
"`` Wait till Cecco comes out , '' growled Starkey , and the others took up the cry ."
"`` I think I heard you volunteer , Starkey , '' said Hook , purring again ."
"`` No , by thunder ! ''"
Starkey cried .
"`` My hook thinks you did , '' said Hook , crossing to him ."
"`` I wonder if it would not be advisable , Starkey , to humour the hook ? ''"
"`` I 'll swing before I go in there , '' replied Starkey doggedly , and again he had the support of the crew ."
`` Is this mutiny ? ''
asked Hook more pleasantly than ever .
`` Starkey 's ringleader ! ''
"`` Captain , mercy ! ''"
"Starkey whimpered , all of a tremble now ."
"`` Shake hands , Starkey , '' said Hook , proffering his claw ."
"Starkey looked round for help , but all deserted him ."
"As he backed up Hook advanced , and now the red spark was in his eye ."
With a despairing scream the pirate leapt upon Long Tom and precipitated himself into the sea .
"`` Four , '' said Slightly ."
"`` And now , '' Hook said courteously , `` did any other gentlemen say mutiny ? ''"
"Seizing a lantern and raising his claw with a menacing gesture , `` I 'll bring out that doodle-doo myself , '' he said , and sped into the cabin ."
"It was in honour of this august visitor that the windows shone with lights ; and at the hour of Dick 's arrival with his sweetheart and her friend , the whole ducal party was being entertained in the refectory with the splendour of that powerful and luxurious monastery ."
"Dick , not quite with his good will , was brought before them ."
"Gloucester , sick with fatigue , sat leaning upon one hand his white and terrifying countenance ; Lord Foxham , half recovered from his wound , was in a place of honour on his left ."
"`` How , sir ? ''"
asked Richard .
`` Have ye brought me Sir Daniel 's head ? ''
"`` My lord duke , '' replied Dick , stoutly enough , but with a qualm at heart , `` I have not even the good fortune to return with my command ."
"I have been , so please your grace , well beaten . ''"
Gloucester looked upon him with a formidable frown .
"`` I gave you fifty lances , -LCB- 3 -RCB- sir , '' he said ."
"`` My lord duke , I had but fifty men-at-arms , '' replied the young knight ."
`` How is this ? ''
said Gloucester .
`` He did ask me fifty lances . ''
"`` May it please your grace , '' replied Catesby , smoothly , `` for a pursuit we gave him but the horsemen . ''"
"`` It is well , '' replied Richard , adding , `` Shelton , ye may go . ''"
`` Stay ! ''
said Lord Foxham .
`` This young man likewise had a charge from me .
It may be he hath better sped .
"Say , Master Shelton , have ye found the maid ? ''"
"`` I praise the saints , my lord , '' said Dick , `` she is in this house . ''"
`` Is it even so ?
"Well , then , my lord the duke , '' resumed Lord Foxham , `` with your good will , to-morrow , before the army march , I do propose a marriage ."
"This young squire -- '' `` Young knight , '' interrupted Catesby ."
"`` Say ye so , Sir William ? ''"
cried Lord Foxham .
"`` I did myself , and for good service , dub him knight , '' said Gloucester ."
`` He hath twice manfully served me .
"It is not valour of hands , it is a man 's mind of iron , that he lacks ."
"He will not rise , Lord Foxham ."
"'T is a fellow that will fight indeed bravely in a mellay , but hath a capon 's heart ."
I only got home half an hour ago ... and no Dora to be seen .
Davy declares he never saw her since I left . ''
"`` Neither I did , '' avowed Davy solemnly ."
"`` She must be somewhere around , '' said Anne ."
`` She would never wander far away alone ... you know how timid she is .
Perhaps she has fallen asleep in one of the rooms . ''
Marilla shook her head .
`` I 've hunted the whole house through .
But she may be in some of the buildings . ''
A thorough search followed .
"Every corner of house , yard , and outbuildings was ransacked by those two distracted people ."
"Anne roved the orchards and the Haunted Wood , calling Dora 's name ."
Marilla took a candle and explored the cellar .
"Davy accompanied each of them in turn , and was fertile in thinking of places where Dora could possibly be ."
Finally they met again in the yard .
"`` It 's a most mysterious thing , '' groaned Marilla ."
`` Where can she be ? ''
"said Anne miserably `` Maybe she 's tumbled into the well , '' suggested Davy cheerfully ."
Anne and Marilla looked fearfully into each other 's eyes .
The thought had been with them both through their entire search but neither had dared to put it into words .
"`` She ... she might have , '' whispered Marilla ."
"Anne , feeling faint and sick , went to the wellbox and peered over ."
The bucket sat on the shelf inside .
Far down below was a tiny glimmer of still water .
The Cuthbert well was the deepest in Avonlea .
If Dora ... but Anne could not face the idea .
She shuddered and turned away .
"`` Run across for Mr. Harrison , '' said Marilla , wringing her hands ."
`` Mr. Harrison and John Henry are both away ... they went to town today .
I 'll go for Mr. Barry . ''
"Mr. Barry came back with Anne , carrying a coil of rope to which was attached a claw-like instrument that had been the business end of a grubbing fork ."
"Marilla and Anne stood by , cold and shaken with horror and dread , while Mr. Barry dragged the well , and Davy , astride the gate , watched the group with a face indicative of huge enjoyment ."
"`` Oh , sir , you are too good , '' said Bertie with a choke in his voice ."
"`` Well , that is settled , '' said the doctor genially ."
`` Come on Monday then .
"And perhaps we can do something for that other little chap , William , or John , or whatever his name is ."
"Will you have some more pudding , Bertie ? ''"
"`` No , thank you , '' said Bertie ."
"Pudding , indeed !"
He could not have eaten another mouthful after such wonderful and unexpected good fortune .
"After dinner they played games , and cracked nuts , and roasted apples , until the clock struck nine ; then Bertie got up to go ."
"`` Off , are you ? ''"
"said the doctor , looking up from his paper ."
"`` Well , I 'll expect you on Monday , remember . ''"
"`` Yes , sir , '' said Bertie happily ."
He was not likely to forget .
As he went out Amy came through the hall with a red sled .
`` Here is William John 's present .
I 've tied all the other things on so that they ca n't fall off . ''
Edith was at the door-with a parcel .
"`` Here are some nuts and candies for William John , '' she said ."
`` And tell him we all wish him a ` Happy New Year . ' ''
"`` Thank you , '' said Bertie ."
`` I 've had a splendid time .
I 'll tell William John .
Goodnight . ''
He stepped out .
It was frostier than ever .
"The snow crackled and snapped , the stars were keen and bright , but to Bertie , running down the street with William John 's sled thumping merrily behind him , the world was aglow with rosy hope and promise ."
He was quite sure he could never forget this wonderful New Year .
"Between the Hill and the Valley It was one of the moist , pleasantly odorous nights of early spring ."
"There was a chill in the evening air , but the grass was growing green in sheltered spots , and Jeffrey Miller had found purple-petalled violets and pink arbutus on the hill that day ."
"Across a valley filled with beech and fir , there was a sunset afterglow , creamy yellow and pale red , with a new moon swung above it ."
"It was a night for a man to walk alone and dream of his love , which was perhaps why Jeffrey Miller came so loiteringly across the springy hill pasture , with his hands full of the mayflowers ."
I did n't s ` pose you 'd know the difference .
I do n't see how you found out it was n't all mine .
"You must be awful clever , teacher . '"
`` I told Annetta it was very wrong to copy another person 's letter and pass it off as her own .
But I 'm afraid that all Annetta repented of was being found out . ''
"` And I do love you , teacher , ' she sobbed ."
"` It was all true , even if the minister wrote it first ."
I do love you with all my heart . '
`` It 's very difficult to scold anybody properly under such circumstances .
`` Here is Barbara Shaw 's letter .
I ca n't reproduce the blots of the original . ''
"` Dear teacher , '' `` You said we might write about a visit ."
I never visited but once .
It was at my Aunt Mary 's last winter .
My Aunt Mary is a very particular woman and a great housekeeper .
The first night I was there we were at tea .
I knocked over a jug and broke it .
Aunt Mary said she had had that jug ever since she was married and nobody had ever broken it before .
When we got up I stepped on her dress and all the gathers tore out of the skirt .
The next morning when I got up I hit the pitcher against the basin and cracked them both and I upset a cup of tea on the tablecloth at breakfast .
When I was helping Aunt Mary with the dinner dishes I dropped a china plate and it smashed .
That evening I fell downstairs and sprained my ankle and had to stay in bed for a week .
I heard Aunt Mary tell Uncle Joseph it was a mercy or I 'd have broken everything in the house .
When I got better it was time to go home .
I do n't like visiting very much .
"I like going to school better , especially since I came to Avonlea . ''"
"` Yours respectfully , '' `` Barbara Shaw . ' ''"
"`` Willie White 's began , '' `` Respected Miss , '' `` I want to tell you about my Very Brave Aunt ."
She lives in Ontario and one day she went out to the barn and saw a dog in the yard .
The dog had no business there so she got a stick and whacked him hard and drove him into the barn and shut him up .
Pretty soon a man came looking for an inaginary lion ' -LRB- Query ; -- Did Willie mean a menagerie lion ? -RRB-
` that had run away from a circus .
"I 've lots of old Admiral Page 's fighting blood in me , you know ."
"The first step is to tabulate just exactly what difficulties among our many difficulties must be ravelled out first -- the capital difficulties , as it were ."
"Most important of all comes -- '' `` Leicester , '' said Mrs. Page ."
Dorinda winked her eyes as she always did when she was doubtful .
"`` Well , I knew he was one of them , but I was n't going to put him the very first ."
"However , we will ."
Leicester 's case stands thus .
"He is a pretty smart boy -- if he was n't my brother , I 'd say he was a very smart boy ."
"He has gone as far in his studies as Willowdale School can take him , has qualified for entrance into the Blue Hill Academy , wants to go there this fall and begin the beginnings of a college course ."
"Well , of course , Mother Page , we ca n't send Leicester to Blue Hill any more than we can send him to the moon . ''"
"`` No , '' mourned Mrs. Page , `` and the poor boy feels so badly over it ."
His heart is set on going to college and being a doctor like his father .
"He believes he could work his way through , if he could only get a start ."
But there is n't any chance .
And I ca n't afford to keep him at school any longer .
He is going into Mr. Churchill 's store at Willow Centre in the fall .
Mr. Churchill has very kindly offered him a place .
"Leicester hates the thought of it -- I know he does , although he never says so . ''"
`` Next to Leicester 's college course we want -- '' `` Music lessons for Jean . ''
Dorinda winked again .
`` Are music lessons for Jean really a difficulty ? ''
she said .
"`` That is , one spelled with a capital ? ''"
"`` Oh , yes , Dorinda dear ."
"At least , I 'm worried over it ."
"Jean loves music so , and she has never had anything , poor child , not even as much school as she ought to have had ."
I 've had to keep her home so much to help me with the work .
"She has been such a good , patient little girl too , and her heart is set on music lessons . ''"
"`` Well , she must have them then -- after we get Leicester 's year at the academy for him ."
That 's two .
"The third is a new -- '' `` The roof must be shingled this fall , '' said Mrs. Page anxiously ."
"`` It really must , Dorinda ."
"if old Harry the Fift were back again , he would stand and let ye shoot at him for a farthen a shoot ! ''"
"`` Nay , Nick , there 's some can draw a good bow yet , '' said Bennet ."
`` Draw a good bow ! ''
cried Appleyard .
`` Yes !
But who 'll shoot me a good shoot ?
"It 's there the eye comes in , and the head between your shoulders ."
"Now , what might you call a long shoot , Bennet Hatch ? ''"
"`` Well , '' said Bennet , looking about him , `` it would be a long shoot from here into the forest . ''"
"`` Ay , it would be a longish shoot , '' said the old fellow , turning to look over his shoulder ; and then he put up his hand over his eyes , and stood staring ."
"`` Why , what are you looking at ? ''"
"asked Bennet , with a chuckle ."
"`` Do , you see Harry the Fift ? ''"
The veteran continued looking up the hill in silence .
The sun shone broadly over the shelving meadows ; a few white sheep wandered browsing ; all was still but the distant jangle of the bell .
"`` What is it , Appleyard ? ''"
asked Dick .
"`` Why , the birds , '' said Appleyard ."
"And , sure enough , over the top of the forest , where it ran down in a tongue among the meadows , and ended in a pair of goodly green elms , about a bowshot from the field where they were standing , a flight of birds was skimming to and fro , in evident disorder ."
`` What of the birds ? ''
said Bennet .
`` Ay ! ''
"returned Appleyard , `` y ' are a wise man to go to war , Master Bennet ."
Birds are a good sentry ; in forest places they be the first line of battle .
"Look you , now , if we lay here in camp , there might be archers skulking down to get the wind of us ; and here would you be , none the wiser ! ''"
"`` Why , old shrew , '' said Hatch , `` there be no men nearer us than Sir Daniel 's , at Kettley ; y ' are as safe as in London Tower ; and ye raise scares upon a man for a few chaffinches and sparrows ! ''"
`` Hear him ! ''
grinned Appleyard .
`` How many a rogue would give his two crop ears to have a shoot at either of us ?
"Saint Michael , man !"
they hate us like two polecats ! ''
"`` Well , sooth it is , they hate Sir Daniel , '' answered Hatch , a little sobered ."
"`` You 're right , Mother dear , as you always are , and we are very selfish girls ."
We will ask Miss Price and try to give her a nice time .
I 'll go down this very evening and see her . ''
"* * * * * In the grey twilight of the chilly autumn evening Bertha Price walked home to her boarding-house , her pale little face paler , and her grey eyes sadder than ever , in the fading light ."
Only two days until Thanksgiving -- but there would be no real Thanksgiving for her .
"Why , she asked herself rebelliously , when there seemed so much love in the world , was she denied her share ?"
Her landlady met her in the hall .
"`` Miss Allen is in the parlour , Miss Price ."
She wants to see you . ''
Bertha went into the parlour somewhat reluctantly .
"She had met Frances Allen only once or twice and she was secretly almost afraid of the handsome , vivacious girl who was so different from herself ."
"`` I am sorry you have had to wait , Miss Allen , '' she said shyly ."
`` I went to see a pupil of mine who is ill and I was kept later than I expected . ''
"`` My errand wo n't take very long , '' said Frances brightly ."
"`` Mother wants you to spend Thanksgiving Day with us , Miss Price , if you have no other engagement ."
"We will have a few other guests , but nobody outside our own family except Mr. Seeley , who is the law partner and intimate friend of my brother Ernest in town ."
"You 'll come , wo n't you ? ''"
"`` Oh , thank you , yes , '' said Bertha , in pleased surprise ."
`` I shall be very glad to go .
"Why , it is so nice to think of it ."
I expected my Thanksgiving Day to be lonely and sad -- not a bit Thanksgivingy . ''
"`` We shall expect you then , '' said Frances , with a cordial little hand-squeeze ."
"`` Come early in the morning , and we will have a real friendly , pleasant day . ''"
"That night Frances said to her mother and sister , `` You never saw such a transfigured face as Miss Price 's when I asked her up ."
She looked positively pretty -- such a lovely pink came out on her cheeks and her eyes shone like stars .
"She reminded me so much of somebody I 've seen , but I ca n't think who it is ."
I 'm so glad we 've asked her here for Thanksgiving ! ''
"* * * * * Thanksgiving came , as bright and beautiful as a day could be , and the Allens ' guests came with it ."
"Bertha Price was among them , paler and shyer than ever ."
"Ernest Allen and his friend , Maxwell Seeley , came out from town on the morning train ."
"After all the necessary introductions had been made , Frances flew to the kitchen ."
"`` I 've found out who it is Miss Price reminds me of , '' she said , as she bustled about the range ."
"`` You both have the advantage of me , '' sighed Anne ."
"`` You 're going to teach children who do n't know you , but I have to teach my own old schoolmates , and Mrs. Lynde says she 's afraid they wo n't respect me as they would a stranger unless I 'm very cross from the first ."
But I do n't believe a teacher should be cross .
"Oh , it seems to me such a responsibility ! ''"
"`` I guess we 'll get on all right , '' said Jane comfortably ."
Jane was not troubled by any aspirations to be an influence for good .
"She meant to earn her salary fairly , please the trustees , and get her name on the School Inspector 's roll of honor ."
Further ambitions Jane had none .
`` The main thing will be to keep order and a teacher has to be a little cross to do that .
If my pupils wo n't do as I tell them I shall punish them . ''
`` How ? ''
"`` Give them a good whipping , of course . ''"
"`` Oh , Jane , you would n't , '' cried Anne , shocked ."
"`` Jane , you COULD N'T ! ''"
"`` Indeed , I could and would , if they deserved it , '' said Jane decidedly ."
"`` I could NEVER whip a child , '' said Anne with equal decision ."
`` I do n't believe in it AT ALL .
Miss Stacy never whipped any of us and she had perfect order ; and Mr. Phillips was always whipping and he had no order at all .
"No , if I ca n't get along without whipping I shall not try to teach school ."
There are better ways of managing .
I shall try to win my pupils ' affections and then they will WANT to do what I tell them . ''
`` But suppose they do n't ? ''
said practical Jane .
`` I would n't whip them anyhow .
I 'm sure it would n't do any good .
"Oh , do n't whip your pupils , Jane dear , no matter what they do . ''"
"`` What do you think about it , Gilbert ? ''"
demanded Jane .
`` Do n't you think there are some children who really need a whipping now and then ? ''
"`` Do n't you think it 's a cruel , barbarous thing to whip a child ... ANY child ? ''"
"exclaimed Anne , her face flushing with earnestness ."
"`` Well , '' said Gilbert slowly , torn between his real convictions and his wish to measure up to Anne 's ideal , `` there 's something to be said on both sides ."
"Each wore a sword , and by a movement of his haunch , thrust clear the hilt of it , so that it might be the more readily grasped and the blade drawn ."
"`` Mr. Stewart , I am thinking , '' says Robin ."
"`` Troth , Mr. Macgregor , it 's not a name to be ashamed of , '' answered Alan ."
"`` I did not know ye were in my country , sir , '' says Robin ."
"`` It sticks in my mind that I am in the country of my friends the Maclarens , '' says Alan ."
"`` That 's a kittle point , '' returned the other ."
`` There may be two words to say to that .
But I think I will have heard that you are a man of your sword ? ''
"`` Unless ye were born deaf , Mr. Macgregor , ye will have heard a good deal more than that , '' says Alan ."
"`` I am not the only man that can draw steel in Appin ; and when my kinsman and captain , Ardshiel , had a talk with a gentleman of your name , not so many years back , I could never hear that the Macgregor had the best of it . ''"
"`` Do ye mean my father , sir ? ''"
says Robin .
"`` Well , I wouldnae wonder , '' said Alan ."
`` The gentleman I have in my mind had the ill-taste to clap Campbell to his name . ''
"`` My father was an old man , '' returned Robin ."
`` The match was unequal .
"You and me would make a better pair , sir . ''"
"`` I was thinking that , '' said Alan ."
"I was half out of bed , and Duncan had been hanging at the elbow of these fighting cocks , ready to intervene upon the least occasion ."
"But when that word was uttered , it was a case of now or never ; and Duncan , with something of a white face to be sure , thrust himself between ."
"`` Gentlemen , '' said he , `` I will have been thinking of a very different matter , whateffer ."
"Here are my pipes , and here are you two gentlemen who are baith acclaimed pipers ."
It 's an auld dispute which one of ye 's the best .
Here will be a braw chance to settle it . ''
"`` Why , sir , '' said Alan , still addressing Robin , from whom indeed he had not so much as shifted his eyes , nor yet Robin from him , `` why , sir , '' says Alan , `` I think I will have heard some sough * of the sort ."
"Have ye music , as folk say ?"
Are ye a bit of a piper ? ''
* Rumour .
`` I can pipe like a Macrimmon ! ''
cries Robin .
"`` And that is a very bold word , '' quoth Alan ."
"`` I have made bolder words good before now , '' returned Robin , `` and that against better adversaries . ''"
"And she said I was always to be kind to Dora and stand up for her , and I 'm going to . ''"
`` Do you call pulling her hair being kind to her ? ''
"`` Well , I ai n't going to let anybody else pull it , '' said Davy , doubling up his fists and frowning ."
`` They 'd just better try it .
I did n't hurt her much ... she just cried 'cause she 's a girl .
I 'm glad I 'm a boy but I 'm sorry I 'm a twin .
"When Jimmy Sprott 's sister conterdicks him he just says , ` I 'm oldern you , so of course I know better , ' and that settles HER ."
"But I ca n't tell Dora that , and she just goes on thinking diffrunt from me ."
"You might let me drive the gee-gee for a spell , since I 'm a man . ''"
"Altogether , Marilla was a thankful woman when she drove into her own yard , where the wind of the autumn night was dancing with the brown leaves ."
Anne was at the gate to meet them and lift the twins out .
"Dora submitted calmly to be kissed , but Davy responded to Anne 's welcome with one of his hearty hugs and the cheerful announcement , `` I 'm Mr. Davy Keith . ''"
"At the supper table Dora behaved like a little lady , but Davy 's manners left much to be desired ."
"`` I 'm so hungry I ai n't got time to eat p ` litely , '' he said when Marilla reproved him ."
`` Dora ai n't half as hungry as I am .
Look at all the ex ` cise I took on the road here .
That cake 's awful nice and plummy .
"We have n't had any cake at home for ever 'n ever so long , 'cause mother was too sick to make it and Mrs. Sprott said it was as much as she could do to bake our bread for us ."
And Mrs. Wiggins never puts any plums in HER cakes .
Catch her !
Can I have another piece ? ''
Marilla would have refused but Anne cut a generous second slice .
"However , she reminded Davy that he ought to say `` Thank you '' for it ."
Davy merely grinned at her and took a huge bite .
"When he had finished the slice he said , `` If you 'll give me ANOTHER piece I 'll say thank you for IT . ''"
"`` No , you have had plenty of cake , '' said Marilla in a tone which Anne knew and Davy was to learn to be final ."
"Davy winked at Anne , and then , leaning over the table , snatched Dora 's first piece of cake , from which she had just taken one dainty little bite , out of her very fingers and , opening his mouth to the fullest extent , crammed the whole slice in ."
Dora 's lip trembled and Marilla was speechless with horror .
"Anne promptly exclaimed , with her best `` schoolma'am '' air , `` Oh , Davy , gentlemen do n't do things like that . ''"
"`` I know they do n't , '' said Davy , as soon as he could speak , `` but I ai n't a gemplum . ''"
`` But do n't you want to be ? ''
said shocked Anne .
"Rilla made a third attempt to give the long-suffering Jims his dinner , but all she could think of was the question -- Would Ken come to see her before he went away ?"
She had not heard from him for a long while .
Had he forgotten her completely ?
If he did not come she would know that he had .
Perhaps there was even -- some other girl back there in Toronto .
Of course there was .
She was a little fool to be thinking about him at all .
She would not think about him .
"If he came , well and good ."
It would only be courteous of him to make a farewell call at Ingleside where he had often been a guest .
"If he did not come -- well and good , too ."
It did not matter very much .
Nobody was going to fret .
That was all settled comfortably -- she was quite indifferent -- but meanwhile Jims was being fed with a haste and recklessness that would have filled the soul of Morgan with horror .
"Jims himself did n't like it , being a methodical baby , accustomed to swallowing spoonfuls with a decent interval for breath between each ."
"He protested , but his protests availed him nothing ."
"Rilla , as far as the care and feeding of infants was concerned , was utterly demoralized ."
Then the telephone-bell rang .
There was nothing unusual about the telephone ringing .
It rang on an average every ten minutes at Ingleside .
But Rilla dropped Jims ' spoon again -- on the carpet this time -- and flew to the ` phone as if life depended on her getting there before anybody else .
"Jims , his patience exhausted , lifted up his voice and wept ."
"`` Hello , is this Ingleside ? ''"
`` Yes . ''
"`` That you , Rilla ? ''"
`` Yeth -- yeth . ''
"Oh , why could n't Jims stop howling for just one little minute ?"
Why did n't somebody come in and choke him ?
`` Know who 's speaking ? ''
"Oh , did n't she know !"
Would n't she know that voice anywhere -- at any time ?
`` It 's Ken -- is n't it ? ''
"`` You see , I was little for fourteen years and I 've only been grown-uppish for scarcely three ."
I 'm sure I shall always feel like a child in the woods .
These walks home from school are almost the only time I have for dreaming ... except the half-hour or so before I go to sleep .
I 'm so busy with teaching and studying and helping Marilla with the twins that I have n't another moment for imagining things .
You do n't know what splendid adventures I have for a little while after I go to bed in the east gable every night .
I always imagine I 'm something very brilliant and triumphant and splendid ... a great prima donna or a Red Cross nurse or a queen .
Last night I was a queen .
It 's really splendid to imagine you are a queen .
"You have all the fun of it without any of the inconveniences and you can stop being a queen whenever you want to , which you could n't in real life ."
"But here in the woods I like best to imagine quite different things ... I 'm a dryad living in an old pine , or a little brown wood-elf hiding under a crinkled leaf ."
That white birch you caught me kissing is a sister of mine .
"The only difference is , she 's a tree and I 'm a girl , but that 's no real difference ."
"Where are you going , Diana ? ''"
`` Down to the Dicksons .
I promised to help Alberta cut out her new dress .
"Ca n't you walk down in the evening , Anne , and come home with me ? ''"
"`` I might ... since Fred Wright is away in town , '' said Anne with a rather too innocent face ."
"Diana blushed , tossed her head , and walked on ."
"She did not look offended , however ."
"Anne fully intended to go down to the Dicksons ' that evening , but she did not ."
When she arrived at Green Gables she found a state of affairs which banished every other thought from her mind .
Marilla met her in the yard ... a wild-eyed Marilla .
"`` Anne , Dora is lost ! ''"
`` Dora !
Lost ! ''
"Anne looked at Davy , who was swinging on the yard gate , and detected merriment in his eyes ."
"`` Davy , do you know where she is ? ''"
"`` No , I do n't , '' said Davy stoutly ."
"`` I have n't seen her since dinner time , cross my heart . ''"
"`` I 've been away ever since one o'clock , '' said Marilla ."
`` Thomas Lynde took sick all of a sudden and Rachel sent up for me to go at once .
When I left here Dora was playing with her doll in the kitchen and Davy was making mud pies behind the barn .
`` It 's Max Seeley .
"You need n't laugh , Al. ."
It 's a fact .
I noticed it the minute I introduced them .
"He 's plump and prosperous and she 's pinched and pale , but there 's a resemblance nevertheless ."
Look for yourself and see if it is n't so . ''
"Back in the big , cheery parlour the Thanksgiving guests were amusing themselves in various ways ."
"Max Seeley had given an odd little start when he was introduced to Miss Price , and as soon as possible he followed her to the corner where she had taken refuge ."
"Ernest Allen was out in the kitchen talking to his sisters , the `` uncles and cousins and aunts '' were all chattering to each other , and Mr. Seeley and Miss Price were quite unnoticed ."
"`` You will excuse me , wo n't you , Miss Price , if I ask you something about yourself ? ''"
he said eagerly .
"`` The truth is , you look so strikingly like someone I used to know that I feel sure you must be related to her ."
I do not think I have any relatives of your name .
Have you any of mine ? ''
"Bertha flushed , hesitated for an instant , then said frankly , `` No , I do not think so ."
"But I may as well tell you that Price is not my real name and I do not know what it is , although I think it begins with S. I believe that my parents died when I was about three years old , and I was then taken to an orphan asylum ."
The next year I was taken from there and adopted by Mrs. Price .
She was very kind to me and treated me as her own daughter .
"I had a happy home with her , although we were poor ."
"Mrs. Price wished me to bear her name , and I did so ."
"She never told me my true surname , perhaps she did not know it ."
"She died when I was sixteen , and since then I have been quite alone in the world ."
That is all I know about myself . ''
Max Seeley was plainly excited .
`` Why do you think your real name begins with S ? ''
he asked .
"`` I have a watch which belonged to my mother , with the monogram ` B.S. ' on the case ."
It was left with the matron of the asylum and she gave it to Mrs. Price for me .
Here it is . ''
"Max Seeley almost snatched the old-fashioned little silver watch , from her hand and opened the case ."
An exclamation escaped him as he pointed to some scratches on the inner side .
"They looked like the initials M.A.S. `` Let me tell my story now , '' he said ."
"I have some myself , though you might never suspect it ."
But anyhow I ai n't going to give anything to that carpet .
"Folks are everlasting begging for money here , it seems to me ."
How 's your project of painting the hall coming on ? ''
`` Splendidly .
We had a meeting of the A.V.I.S. last Friday night and found that we had plenty of money subscribed to paint the hall and shingle the roof too .
"MOST people gave very liberally , Mr. Harrison . ''"
"Anne was a sweet-souled lass , but she could instill some venom into innocent italics when occasion required ."
`` What color are you going to have it ? ''
`` We have decided on a very pretty green .
"The roof will be dark red , of course ."
Mr. Roger Pye is going to get the paint in town today . ''
`` Who 's got the job ? ''
`` Mr. Joshua Pye of Carmody .
He has nearly finished the shingling .
"We had to give him the contract , for every one of the Pyes ... and there are four families , you know ... said they would n't give a cent unless Joshua got it ."
"They had subscribed twelve dollars between them and we thought that was too much to lose , although some people think we should n't have given in to the Pyes ."
Mrs. Lynde says they try to run everything . ''
`` The main question is will this Joshua do his work well .
If he does I do n't see that it matters whether his name is Pye or Pudding . ''
"`` He has the reputation of being a good workman , though they say he 's a very peculiar man ."
He hardly ever talks . ''
"`` He 's peculiar enough all right then , '' said Mr. Harrison drily ."
"`` Or at least , folks here will call him so ."
I never was much of a talker till I came to Avonlea and then I had to begin in self-defense or Mrs. Lynde would have said I was dumb and started a subscription to have me taught sign language .
"You 're not going yet , Anne ? ''"
`` I must .
I have some sewing to do for Dora this evening .
"Besides , Davy is probably breaking Marilla 's heart with some new mischief by this time ."
"This morning the first thing he said was , ` Where does the dark go , Anne ?"
I want to know . '
I told him it went around to the other side of the world but after breakfast he declared it did n't ... that it went down the well .
"`` For , by my sooth , y ' are here and I do mightily suspect your honesty ."
"If ye would save your neck , write me swiftly an obligation for twenty pound . ''"
"`` For twenty pound , my good lord ! ''"
cried Condall .
`` Here is midsummer madness !
My whole estate amounteth not to seventy shillings . ''
"`` Condall or Tyndal , '' returned Sir Daniel , grinning , `` I will run my peril of that loss ."
"Write me down twenty , and when I have recovered all I may , I will be good lord to you , and pardon you the rest . ''"
`` Alas !
"my good lord , it may not be ; I have no skill to write , '' said Condall ."
`` Well-a-day ! ''
returned the knight .
"`` Here , then , is no remedy ."
"Yet I would fain have spared you , Tyndal , had my conscience suffered ."
"Selden , take me this old shrew softly to the nearest elm , and hang me him tenderly by the neck , where I may see him at my riding ."
"Fare ye well , good Master Condall , dear Master Tyndal ; y ' are post-haste for Paradise ; fare ye then well ! ''"
"`` Nay , my right pleasant lord , '' replied Condall , forcing an obsequious smile , `` an ye be so masterful , as doth right well become you , I will even , with all my poor skill , do your good bidding . ''"
"`` Friend , '' quoth Sir Daniel , `` ye will now write two score ."
Go to !
y ' are too cunning for a livelihood of seventy shillings .
"Selden , see him write me this in good form , and have it duly witnessed . ''"
"And Sir Daniel , who was a very merry knight , none merrier in England , took a drink of his mulled ale , and lay back , smiling ."
"Meanwhile , the boy upon the floor began to stir , and presently sat up and looked about him with a scare ."
"`` Hither , '' said Sir Daniel ; and as the other rose at his command and came slowly towards him , he leaned back and laughed outright ."
`` By the rood ! ''
"he cried , `` a sturdy boy ! ''"
"The lad flushed crimson with anger , and darted a look of hate out of his dark eyes ."
"Now that he was on his legs , it was more difficult to make certain of his age ."
"His face looked somewhat older in expression , but it was as smooth as a young child 's ; and in bone and body he was unusually slender , and somewhat awkward of gait ."
"`` Ye have called me , Sir Daniel , '' he said ."
`` Was it to laugh at my poor plight ? ''
"`` Nay , now , let laugh , '' said the knight ."
`` Five . ''
How Slightly longed to say it .
"He wetted his lips to be ready , but Hook came staggering out , without his lantern ."
"`` Something blew out the light , '' he said a little unsteadily ."
`` Something ! ''
echoed Mullins .
`` What of Cecco ? ''
demanded Noodler .
"`` He 's as dead as Jukes , '' said Hook shortly ."
"His reluctance to return to the cabin impressed them all unfavourably , and the mutinous sounds again broke forth ."
"All pirates are superstitious , and Cookson cried , `` They do say the surest sign a ship 's accurst is when there 's one on board more than can be accounted for . ''"
"`` I 've heard , '' muttered Mullins , `` he always boards the pirate craft last ."
"Had he a tail , captain ? ''"
"`` They say , '' said another , looking viciously at Hook , `` that when he comes it 's in the likeness of the wickedest man aboard . ''"
"`` Had he a hook , captain ? ''"
"asked Cookson insolently ; and one after another took up the cry , `` The ship 's doomed ! ''"
At this the children could not resist raising a cheer .
"Hook had well-nigh forgotten his prisoners , but as he swung round on them now his face lit up again ."
"`` Lads , '' he cried to his crew , `` now here 's a notion ."
Open the cabin door and drive them in .
Let them fight the doodle-doo for their lives .
"If they kill him , we 're so much the better ; if he kills them , we 're none the worse . ''"
"For the last time his dogs admired Hook , and devotedly they did his bidding ."
"The boys , pretending to struggle , were pushed into the cabin and the door was closed on them ."
"`` Now , listen ! ''"
"cried Hook , and all listened ."
But not one dared to face the door .
"Yes , one , Wendy , who all this time had been bound to the mast ."
"It was for neither a scream nor a crow that she was watching , it was for the reappearance of Peter ."
She had not long to wait .
"In the cabin he had found the thing for which he had gone in search : the key that would free the children of their manacles , and now they all stole forth , armed with such weapons as they could find ."
"First signing them to hide , Peter cut Wendy 's bonds , and then nothing could have been easier than for them all to fly off together ; but one thing barred the way , an oath , `` Hook or me this time . ''"
"`` The dog is mine , and I shall do with him as I think fit ."
"He is sold , and that is all there is about it ."
Go on with your dinner . ''
But Ernest for the first time did not obey .
"He snatched his cap from the back of his chair , dashed it down over his eyes , and ran from the kitchen with a sob choking his breath ."
"Uncle Richard looked angry , but Aunt Kate hastened to soothe him ."
"`` Do n't be vexed with the boy , Richard , '' she said ."
`` You know he is very fond of Laddie .
"He 's had to do with him ever since he was a pup , and no doubt he feels badly at the thought of losing him ."
I 'm rather sorry myself that you have sold the dog . ''
"`` Well , he is sold and there 's an end of it ."
I do n't say but that the dog is a good dog .
"But he is of no use to us , and twenty dollars will come in mighty handy just now ."
"He 's worth that to Bob , for he is a good watch dog , so we 've both made a fair bargain . ''"
Nothing more was said about Ernest or Laddie .
"I had taken no part in the discussion , for I felt no great interest in the matter ."
"Laddie was a nice dog ; Ernest was a quiet , inoffensive little fellow , five years younger than myself ; that was all I thought about either of them ."
I was spending my vacation at Uncle Richard 's farm on the Nova Scotian Bay of Fundy shore .
"I was a great favourite with Uncle Richard , partly because he had been much attached to my mother , his only sister , partly because of my strong resemblance to his only son , who had died several years before ."
"Uncle Richard was a stern , undemonstrative man , but I knew that he entertained a deep and real affection for me , and I always enjoyed my vacation sojourns at his place ."
"`` What are you going to do this afternoon , Ned ? ''"
"he asked , after the disturbance caused by Ernest 's outbreak had quieted down ."
"`` I think I 'll row out to Island Rock , '' I replied ."
`` I want to take some views of the shore from it . ''
Uncle Richard nodded .
He was much interested in my new camera .
"`` If you 're on it about four o'clock , you 'll get a fine view of the ` Hole in the Wall ' when the sun begins to shine on the water through it , '' he said ."
`` I 've often thought it would make a handsome picture . ''
"`` After I 've finished taking the pictures , I think I 'll go down shore to Uncle Adam 's and stay all night , '' I said ."
"`` Jim 's dark room is more convenient than mine , and he has some pictures he is going to develop tonight , too . ''"
I started for the shore about two o'clock .
"Ernest was sitting on the woodpile as I passed through the yard , with his arms about Laddie 's neck and his face buried in Laddie 's curly hair ."
There was some strange passion in her voice that Alan did not quite understand -- a bitterness and a revolt which he took to be against the circumstances that hedged her in .
`` Is not some other life possible for you if your present life does not content you ? ''
he said gently .
"`` But it does content me , '' said Lynde imperiously ."
"`` I want no other -- I wish this life to go on forever -- forever , do you understand ?"
"If I were sure that it would -- if I were sure that no change would ever come to me , I would be perfectly content ."
It is the fear that a change will come that makes me wretched .
Oh ! ''
She shuddered and put her hands over her eyes .
Alan thought she must mean that when her father died she would be alone in the world .
He wanted to comfort her -- reassure her -- but he did not know how .
"One evening when he went to Four Winds he found the door open and , seeing the Captain in the living room , he stepped in unannounced ."
"Captain Anthony was sitting by the table , his head in his hands ; at Alan 's entrance he turned upon him a haggard face , blackened by a furious scowl beneath which blazed eyes full of malevolence ."
`` What do you want here ? ''
"he said , following up the demand with a string of vile oaths ."
"Before Alan could summon his scattered wits , Lynde glided in with a white , appealing face ."
"Wordlessly she grasped Alan 's arm , drew him out , and shut the door ."
"`` Oh , I 've been watching for you , '' she said breathlessly ."
`` I was afraid you might come tonight -- but I missed you . ''
`` But your father ? ''
said Alan in amazement .
`` How have I angered him ? ''
`` Hush .
Come into the garden .
I will explain there . ''
He followed her into the little enclosure where the red and white roses were now in full blow .
"`` Father is n't angry with you , '' said Lynde in a low shamed voice ."
`` It 's just -- he takes strange moods sometimes .
Then he seems to hate us all -- even me -- and he is like that for days .
He seems to suspect and dread everybody as if they were plotting against him .
You -- perhaps you think he has been drinking ?
"No , that is not the trouble ."
"`` Gone , '' shouted Mrs. Palmer , `` gone ."
She left on the train Mollie come on .
"Gracious me , has the man gone crazy ?"
He has n't seemed like himself at all this afternoon . ''
Murray had bolted madly out of the house and was striding down the lane .
Blind fool -- unspeakable idiot that he had been !
"To take her for Mrs. Palmer 's niece -- that peerless creature with the calm acceptance of any situation , which marked the woman of the world , with the fine appreciation and quickness of repartee that spoke of generations of culture -- to imagine that she could be Mollie Booth !"
"He had been blind , besottedly blind ."
And now he had lost her !
She would never forgive him ; she had gone without a word or sign .
"As he reached the last curve of the lane where it looped about the apple trees , a plump figure came flying down the orchard slope ."
"`` Mr. Murray , Mr. Murray , '' Mollie Booth called breathlessly ."
`` Will you please come here just a minute ? ''
Murray crossed over to the paling rather grumpily .
He did not want to talk with Mollie Booth just then .
"Confound it , what did the girl want ?"
Why was she looking so mysterious ?
Mollie produced a little square grey envelope from some feminine hiding place and handed it over the paling .
"`` She give me this at the station -- Miss Mannering did , '' she gasped , `` and asked me to give it to you without letting Aunt Emily Jane see ."
"I could n't get a chanst when you was in , but as soon as you went I slipped out by the porch door and followed you ."
You went so fast I near died trying to head you off . ''
"`` You dear little soul , '' said Murray , suddenly radiant ."
`` It is too bad you have had to put yourself so out of breath on my account .
But I am immensely obliged to you .
The next time your young man wants a trusty private messenger just refer him to me . ''
"`` Git away with you , '' giggled Mollie ."
`` I must hurry back ` fore Aunt Emily Jane gits wind I 'm gone .
I hope there 's good news in your girl 's letter .
"My , but did n't you look flat when Aunt said she 'd went ! ''"
Murray beamed at her idiotically .
When she had vanished among the trees he opened his letter .
"`` Dear Mr. Murray , '' it ran , `` your unblushing audacity of the morning deserves some punishment ."
"`` I take care of myself and Boo , and she looks after you ."
The house goes any way . ''
`` I should think so !
I nearly broke my neck over the parlor sofa in the hall to-night .
What is it there for ? ''
Molly laughed .
"`` That 's the joke , sir , Miss Bat is cleaning house , and I 'm sure it needs cleaning , for it is years since it was properly done ."
I thought you might have told her to . ''
`` I 've said nothing .
Do n't like house-cleaning well enough to suggest it .
I did think the hall was rather dirty when I dropped my coat and took it up covered with lint .
Is she going to upset the whole place ? ''
"asked Mr. Bemis , looking alarmed at the prospect ."
"`` I hope so , for I really am ashamed when people come , to have them see the dust and cobwebs , and old carpets and dirty windows , '' said Molly , with a sigh , though she never had cared a bit till lately ."
"`` Why do n't you dust round a little , then ?"
No time to spare from the books and play ? ''
"`` I tried , father , but Miss Bat did n't like it , and it was too hard for me alone ."
"If things were once in nice order , I think I could keep them so ; for I do want to be neat , and I 'm learning as fast as I can . ''"
"`` It is high time someone took hold , if matters are left as you say ."
"I 've just been thinking what a clever woman Miss Bat was , to make such a tidy little girl out of what I used to hear called the greatest tomboy in town , and wondering what I could give the old lady ."
"Now I find you are the one to be thanked , and it is a very pleasant surprise to me . ''"
"`` Give her the present , please ; I 'm satisfied , if you like what I 've done ."
"It is n't much , and I did n't know as you would ever observe any difference ."
"But I did try , and now I guess I 'm really getting on , '' said Molly , sewing away with a bright color in her cheeks , for she , too , found it a pleasant surprise to be praised after many failures and few successes ."
"`` You certainly are , my dear ."
"I 'll wait till the house-cleaning is over , and then , if we are all alive , I 'll see about Miss Bat 's reward ."
"Meantime , you go with Mrs. Grant and get whatever you and the boy need , and send the bills to me ; '' and Mr. Bemis lighted a cigar , as if that matter was settled ."
"`` Oh , thank you , sir !"
That will be splendid .
"Merry always has pretty things , and I know you will like me when I get fixed , '' said Molly , smoothing down her apron , with a little air ."
`` Seems to me you look very well as you are .
Is n't that a pretty enough frock ? ''
He shall down .
Mum ! ''
And he bent over his oars .
"They pulled a long way up the river , turned the tail of an island , and came softly down a narrow channel next the opposite bank ."
Then Hugh held water in midstream .
"`` I must land you here among the willows , '' he said ."
"`` Here is no path but willow swamps and quagmires , '' answered Dick ."
"`` Master Shelton , '' replied Hugh , `` I dare not take ye nearer down , for your own sake now ."
"He watcheth me the ferry , lying on his bow ."
"All that go by and owe Sir Daniel goodwill , he shooteth down like rabbits ."
I heard him swear it by the rood .
"An I had not known you of old days -- ay , and from so high upward -- I would ` a ' let you go on ; but for old days ' remembrance , and because ye had this toy with you that 's not fit for wounds or warfare , I did risk my two poor ears to have you over whole ."
"Content you ; I can no more , on my salvation ! ''"
"Hugh was still speaking , lying on his oars , when there came a great shout from among the willows on the island , and sounds followed as of a strong man breasting roughly through the wood ."
`` A murrain ! ''
cried Hugh .
`` He was on the upper island all the while ! ''
He pulled straight for shore .
"`` Threat me with your bow , good Dick ; threat me with it plain , '' he added ."
"`` I have tried to save your skins , save you mine ! ''"
The boat ran into a tough thicket of willows with a crash .
"Matcham , pale , but steady and alert , at a sign from Dick , ran along the thwarts and leaped ashore ; Dick , taking the horse by the bridle , sought to follow , but what with the animal 's bulk , and what with the closeness of the thicket , both stuck fast ."
"The horse neighed and trampled ; and the boat , which was swinging in an eddy , came on and off and pitched with violence ."
"`` It may not be , Hugh ; here is no landing , '' cried Dick ; but he still struggled valiantly with the obstinate thicket and the startled animal ."
"A tall man appeared upon the shore of the island , a long-bow in his hand ."
"Dick saw him for an instant , with the corner of his eye , bending the bow with a great effort , his face crimson with hurry ."
`` Who goes ? ''
he shouted .
"`` Hugh , who goes ? '' ''"
"'T is Master Shelton , John , '' replied the ferryman ."
"`` Stand , Dick Shelton ! ''"
bawled the man upon the island .
`` Lazy ? ''
`` Certainly .
"Laziness is a virtue in these strenuous days , I was not born with it , but I have painstakingly acquired it , and I am proud of my success ."
I have time to enjoy life . ''
"`` I think that I like you , '' said Mollie ."
"`` You have the merit of being able to enter into a situation , '' he assured her ."
When the last Jersey was milked they carried the pails down to the spring where the creamers were sunk and strained the milk into them .
Murray washed the pails and Mollie wiped them and set them in a gleaming row on the shelf under a big maple .
"`` Thank you , '' she said ."
"`` You are not going yet , '' said Murray resolutely ."
`` The time I saved you in milking three cows belongs to me .
We will spend it in a walk along the pond shore .
I will show you a path I have discovered under the beeches .
It is just wide enough for two .
Come . ''
"He took her hand and drew her through the copse into a green lane , where the ferns grew thickly on either side and the pond waters plashed dreamily below them ."
"He kept her hand in his as they went down the path , and she did not try to withdraw it ."
"About them was the great , pure silence of the morning , faintly threaded with caressing sounds -- croon of birds , gurgle of waters , sough of wind ."
The spirit of youth and love hovered over them and they spoke no word .
"When they finally came out on a little green nook swimming in early sunshine and arched over by maples , with the wide shimmer of the pond before it and the gold dust of blossoms over the grass , the girl drew a long breath of delight ."
"`` It is a morning left over from Eden , is n't it ? ''"
said Murray .
"`` Yes , '' said Mollie softly ."
Murray bent toward her .
"`` You are Eve , '' he said ."
`` You are the only woman in the world -- for me .
Adam must have told Eve just what he thought about her the first time he saw her .
There were no conventionalities in Eden -- and people could not have taken long to make up their minds .
We are in Eden just now .
One can say what he thinks in Eden without being ridiculous .
"You are divinely fair , Eve ."
Your eyes are stars of the morning -- your cheek has the flush it stole from the sunrise-your lips are redder than the roses of paradise .
`` Let us run . ''
"`` Not so , '' returned Dick ."
`` See ye not ?
-- he is stone blind .
He guideth him with a staff .
"Let us lie still ; the wind bloweth towards the path , and he will go by and hurt us not ."
"Alas , poor soul , and we should rather pity him ! ''"
"`` I will pity him when he is by , '' replied Matcham ."
"The blind leper was now about halfway towards them , and just then the sun rose and shone full on his veiled face ."
"He had been a tall man before he was bowed by his disgusting sickness , and even now he walked with a vigorous step ."
"The dismal beating of his bell , the pattering of the stick , the eyeless screen before his countenance , and the knowledge that he was not only doomed to death and suffering , but shut out for ever from the touch of his fellow-men , filled the lads ' bosoms with dismay ; and at every step that brought him nearer , their courage and strength seemed to desert them ."
"As he came about level with the pit , he paused , and turned his face full upon the lads ."
`` Mary be my shield !
He sees us ! ''
"said Matcham , faintly ."
`` Hush ! ''
whispered Dick .
`` He doth but hearken .
"He is blind , fool ! ''"
"The leper looked or listened , whichever he was really doing , for some seconds ."
"Then he began to move on again , but presently paused once more , and again turned and seemed to gaze upon the lads ."
"Even Dick became dead-white and closed his eyes , as if by the mere sight he might become infected ."
"But soon the bell sounded , and this time , without any farther hesitation , the leper crossed the remainder of the little heath and disappeared into the covert of the woods ."
"`` He saw us , '' said Matcham ."
`` I could swear it ! ''
`` Tut ! ''
"returned Dick , recovering some sparks of courage ."
`` He but heard us .
"He was in fear , poor soul !"
"An ye were blind , and walked in a perpetual night , ye would start yourself , if ever a twig rustled or a bird cried ` Peep . ' ''"
"`` Dick , good Dick , he saw us , '' repeated Matcham ."
"`` When a man hearkeneth , he doth not as this man ; he doth otherwise , Dick ."
She dared not say it was impossible .
But Aunt Emma had no such scruples .
"With a great clatter and racket , that lady fell upon the dishes that held Patty 's almost untasted dinner and whisked them away while her tongue kept time to her jerky movements ."
"`` Goodness me , doctor , do you think you 're talking to millionaires ?"
Where do you suppose the money is to come from to send Patty to the country ?
"I ca n't afford it , that is certain ."
"I think I do pretty well to give Marcella and Patty their board free , and I have to work my fingers to the bone to do that ."
"It 's all nonsense about Patty , anyhow ."
What she ought to do is to make an effort to get better .
She does n't -- she just mopes and pines .
She wo n't eat a thing I cook for her .
How can anyone expect to get better if she does n't eat ? ''
Aunt Emma glared at the doctor as if she were triumphantly sure that she had propounded an unanswerable question .
A dull red flush rose to Marcella 's face .
"`` Oh , Aunt Emma , I ca n't eat ! ''"
said Patty wearily .
"`` It is n't because I wo n't -- indeed , I ca n't . ''"
`` Humph !
I suppose my cooking is n't fancy enough for you -- that 's the trouble .
"Well , I have n't the time to put any frills on it ."
I think I do pretty well to wait on you at all with all that work piling up before me .
But some people imagine that they were born to be waited on . ''
"Aunt Emma whirled the last dish from the table and left the room , slamming the door behind her ."
The doctor shrugged his shoulders .
He had become used to Miss Gibson 's tirades during Patty 's illness .
"But Marcella had never got used to them -- never , in all the three years she had lived with her aunt ."
They flicked on the raw as keenly as ever .
This morning it seemed unbearable .
It took every atom of Marcella 's self-control to keep her from voicing her resentful thoughts .
It was only for Patty 's sake that she was able to restrain herself .
"It was only for Patty 's sake , too , that she did not , as soon as the doctor had gone , give way to tears ."
"Instead , she smiled bravely into the little sister 's eyes ."
"When I left the man , I worked for a couple of weeks with a farmer , but I thrashed his boy , and then the old man thrashed me , and I ran off again and walked here . ''"
`` All the way ? ''
"`` Yes , the man did n't pay me , and I would n't ask for it ."
"Took it out in beating the boy , '' and Dan laughed , yet looked ashamed , as he glanced at his ragged clothes and dirty hands ."
`` How did you live ?
"It was a long , long tramp for a boy like you . ''"
"`` Oh , I got on well enough , till I hurt my foot ."
"Folks gave me things to eat , and I slept in barns and tramped by day ."
"I got lost trying to make a short cut , or I 'd have been here sooner . ''"
"`` But if you did not mean to come in and stay with us , what were you going to do ? ''"
"`` I thought I 'd like to see Teddy again , and you ; and then I was going back to my old work in the city , only I was so tired I went to sleep on the hay ."
"I 'd have been gone in the morning , if you had n't found me . ''"
`` Are you sorry I did ? ''
"and Mrs. Jo looked at him with a half merry , half reproachful look , as she knelt down to look at his wounded foot ."
"The color came up into Dan 's face , and he kept his eyes fixed on his plate , as he said very low , `` No , ma'am , I 'm glad , I wanted to stay , but I was afraid you -- '' He did not finish , for Mrs. Bhaer interrupted him by an exclamation of pity , as she saw his foot , for it was seriously hurt ."
`` When did you do it ? ''
`` Three days ago . ''
`` And you have walked on it in this state ? ''
"`` I had a stick , and I washed it at every brook I came to , and one woman gave me a rag to put on it . ''"
"`` Mr. Bhaer must see and dress it at once , '' and Mrs. Jo hastened into the next room , leaving the door ajar behind her , so that Dan heard all that passed ."
"`` Fritz , the boy has come back . ''"
`` Who ?
Dan ? ''
"`` Yes , Teddy saw him at the window , and he called to him , but he went away and hid behind the hay-cocks on the lawn ."
"I found him there just now fast asleep , and half dead with weariness and pain ."
"He ran away from Page a month ago , and has been making his way to us ever since ."
"He pretends that he did not mean to let us see him , but go on to the city , and his old work , after a look at us ."
"It is evident , however , that the hope of being taken in has led him here through every thing , and there he is waiting to know if you will forgive and take him back . ''"
`` Did he say so ? ''
"`` His eyes did , and when I waked him , he said , like a lost child , ` Mother Bhaer , I 've come home . '"
"I had n't the heart to scold him , and just took him in like a poor little black sheep come back to the fold ."
"I may keep him , Fritz ? ''"
"said I. `` Your money too , '' says Alan , with a groan ."
`` Ye shouldnae have given it me .
I 'm daft when I get to the cartes . ''
`` Hoot-toot !
hoot-toot ! ''
said Cluny .
`` It was all daffing ; it 's all nonsense .
"Of course you 'll have your money back again , and the double of it , if ye 'll make so free with me ."
It would be a singular thing for me to keep it .
It 's not to be supposed that I would be any hindrance to gentlemen in your situation ; that would be a singular thing ! ''
"cries he , and began to pull gold out of his pocket with a mighty red face ."
"Alan said nothing , only looked on the ground ."
"`` Will you step to the door with me , sir ? ''"
"said I. Cluny said he would be very glad , and followed me readily enough , but he looked flustered and put out ."
"`` And now , sir , '' says I , `` I must first acknowledge your generosity . ''"
`` Nonsensical nonsense ! ''
cries Cluny .
`` Where 's the generosity ?
"This is just a most unfortunate affair ; but what would ye have me do -- boxed up in this bee-skep of a cage of mine -- but just set my friends to the cartes , when I can get them ?"
"And if they lose , of course , it 's not to be supposed -- '' And here he came to a pause ."
"`` Yes , '' said I , `` if they lose , you give them back their money ; and if they win , they carry away yours in their pouches !"
"I have said before that I grant your generosity ; but to me , sir , it 's a very painful thing to be placed in this position . ''"
"There was a little silence , in which Cluny seemed always as if he was about to speak , but said nothing ."
All the time he grew redder and redder in the face .
"`` I am a young man , '' said I , `` and I ask your advice ."
Advise me as you would your son .
"My friend fairly lost his money , after having fairly gained a far greater sum of yours ; can I accept it back again ?"
Would that be the right part for me to play ?
"Whatever I do , you can see for yourself it must be hard upon a man of any pride . ''"
"`` It 's rather hard on me , too , Mr. Balfour , '' said Cluny , `` and ye give me very much the look of a man that has entrapped poor people to their hurt ."
"I wouldnae have my friends come to any house of mine to accept affronts ; no , '' he cried , with a sudden heat of anger , `` nor yet to give them ! ''"
"`` And so you see , sir , '' said I , `` there is something to be said upon my side ; and this gambling is a very poor employ for gentlefolks ."
"There was a pause , then a cry of surprise , and then a voice shouting from the house , `` Bill 's dead . ''"
But the blind man swore at them again for their delay .
"`` Search him , some of you shirking lubbers , and the rest of you aloft and get the chest , '' he cried ."
"I could hear their feet rattling up our old stairs , so that the house must have shook with it ."
"Promptly afterwards , fresh sounds of astonishment arose ; the window of the captain 's room was thrown open with a slam and a jingle of broken glass , and a man leaned out into the moonlight , head and shoulders , and addressed the blind beggar on the road below him ."
"`` Pew , '' he cried , `` they 've been before us ."
Someone 's turned the chest out alow and aloft . ''
`` Is it there ? ''
roared Pew .
`` The money 's there . ''
The blind man cursed the money .
"`` Flint 's fist , I mean , '' he cried ."
"`` We do n't see it here nohow , '' returned the man ."
"`` Here , you below there , is it on Bill ? ''"
cried the blind man again .
"At that another fellow , probably him who had remained below to search the captain 's body , came to the door of the inn ."
"`` Bill 's been overhauled a ` ready , '' said he ; `` nothin ' left . ''"
`` It 's these people of the inn -- it 's that boy .
I wish I had put his eyes out ! ''
"cried the blind man , Pew ."
`` There were no time ago -- they had the door bolted when I tried it .
"Scatter , lads , and find 'em . ''"
"`` Sure enough , they left their glim here , '' said the fellow from the window ."
`` Scatter and find 'em !
Rout the house out ! ''
"reiterated Pew , striking with his stick upon the road ."
"Then there followed a great to-do through all our old inn , heavy feet pounding to and fro , furniture thrown over , doors kicked in , until the very rocks re-echoed and the men came out again , one after another , on the road and declared that we were nowhere to be found ."
"And just the same whistle that had alarmed my mother and myself over the dead captain 's money was once more clearly audible through the night , but this time twice repeated ."
"I had thought it to be the blind man 's trumpet , so to speak , summoning his crew to the assault , but I now found that it was a signal from the hillside towards the hamlet , and from its effect upon the buccaneers , a signal to warn them of approaching danger ."
"`` There 's Dirk again , '' said one ."
`` Twice !
"We 'll have to budge , mates . ''"
"` Please , sir , ' Peter explained , ' a lady lies very ill . '"
"She was lying at their feet , but Slightly had the sense not to see her ."
"` Tut , tut , tut , ' he said , ` where does she lie ? '"
` In yonder glade . ' '
"I will put a glass thing in her mouth , ' said Slightly ; and he made-believe to do it , while Peter waited ."
It was an anxious moment when the glass thing was withdrawn .
` How is she ? '
inquired Peter .
"` Tut , tut , tut , ' said Slightly , ` this has cured her . ' '"
"I am glad , ' Peter cried . '"
"I will call again in the evening , ' Slightly said ; ` give her beef tea out of a cup with a spout to it ' ; but after he had returned the hat to John he blew big breaths , which was his habit on escaping from a difficulty ."
In the meantime the wood had been alive with the sound of axes ; almost everything needed for a cosy dwelling already lay at Wendy 's feet .
"` If only we knew , ' said one , ` the kind of house she likes best . '"
"` Peter , ' shouted another , ` she is moving in her sleep . '"
"` Her mouth opens , ' cried a third , looking respectfully into it ."
"` Oh , lovely ! '"
"` Perhaps she is going to sing in her sleep , ' said Peter ."
"` Wendy , sing the kind of house you would like to have . '"
"Immediately , without opening her eyes , Wendy began to sing : ' I wish I had a pretty house , The littlest ever seen , With funny little red walls And roof of mossy green . '"
"They gurgled with joy at this , for by the greatest good luck the branches they had brought were sticky with red sap , and all the ground was carpeted with moss ."
"As they rattled up the little house they broke into song themselves : ` We 've built the little walls and roof And made a lovely door , So tell us , mother Wendy , What are you wanting more ? '"
"To this she answered rather greedily : ` Oh , really next I think I 'll have Gay windows all about , With roses peeping in , you know , And babies peeping out . '"
"With a blow of their fists they made windows , and large yellow leaves were the blinds ."
But roses -- ?
"` Roses , ' cried Peter sternly ."
Quickly they made-believe to grow the loveliest roses up the walls .
Babies ?
"To prevent Peter ordering babies they hurried into song again : ` We 've made the roses peeping out , The babes are at the door , We can not make ourselves , you know , ` Cos we 've been made before . '"
"Peter , seeing this to be a good idea , at once pretended that it was his own ."
"The house was quite beautiful , and no doubt Wendy was very cosy within , though , of course , they could no longer see her ."
"Peter strode up and down , ordering finishing touches ."
Nothing escaped his eagle eye .
"When a mate brings a slip on his cable -- one as knows me , I mean -- it wo n't be in the same world with old John ."
"There was some that was feared of Pew , and some that was feared of Flint ; but Flint his own self was feared of me ."
"Feared he was , and proud ."
"They was the roughest crew afloat , was Flint 's ; the devil himself would have been feared to go to sea with them ."
"Well now , I tell you , I 'm not a boasting man , and you seen yourself how easy I keep company , but when I was quartermaster , LAMBS was n't the word for Flint 's old buccaneers ."
"Ah , you may be sure of yourself in old John 's ship . ''"
"`` Well , I tell you now , '' replied the lad , `` I did n't half a quarter like the job till I had this talk with you , John ; but there 's my hand on it now . ''"
"`` And a brave lad you were , and smart too , '' answered Silver , shaking hands so heartily that all the barrel shook , `` and a finer figurehead for a gentleman of fortune I never clapped my eyes on . ''"
By this time I had begun to understand the meaning of their terms .
"By a `` gentleman of fortune '' they plainly meant neither more nor less than a common pirate , and the little scene that I had overheard was the last act in the corruption of one of the honest hands -- perhaps of the last one left aboard ."
"But on this point I was soon to be relieved , for Silver giving a little whistle , a third man strolled up and sat down by the party ."
"`` Dick 's square , '' said Silver ."
"`` Oh , I know 'd Dick was square , '' returned the voice of the coxswain , Israel Hands ."
"`` He 's no fool , is Dick . ''"
And he turned his quid and spat .
"`` But look here , '' he went on , `` here 's what I want to know , Barbecue : how long are we a-going to stand off and on like a blessed bumboat ?"
"I 've had a ` most enough o ' Cap'n Smollett ; he 's hazed me long enough , by thunder !"
"I want to go into that cabin , I do ."
"I want their pickles and wines , and that . ''"
"`` Israel , '' said Silver , `` your head ai n't much account , nor ever was ."
"But you 're able to hear , I reckon ; leastways , your ears is big enough ."
"Now , here 's what I say : you 'll berth forward , and you 'll live hard , and you 'll speak soft , and you 'll keep sober till I give the word ; and you may lay to that , my son . ''"
"`` Well , I do n't say no , do I ? ''"
growled the coxswain .
"`` What I say is , when ?"
That 's what I say . ''
`` When !
By the powers ! ''
cried Silver .
"`` Well now , if you want to know , I 'll tell you when ."
"The last moment I can manage , and that 's when ."
"Here 's a first-rate seaman , Cap'n Smollett , sails the blessed ship for us ."
"`` Ye shall have no hurt , upon the rood !"
Stand !
"Back out , Hugh Ferryman . ''"
Dick cried a taunting answer .
"`` Nay , then , ye shall go afoot , '' returned the man ; and he let drive an arrow ."
"The horse , struck by the shaft , lashed out in agony and terror ; the boat capsized , and the next moment all were struggling in the eddies of the river ."
"When Dick came up , he was within a yard of the bank ; and before his eyes were clear , his hand had closed on something firm and strong that instantly began to drag him forward ."
"It was the riding-rod , that Matcham , crawling forth upon an overhanging willow , had opportunely thrust into his grasp ."
`` By the mass ! ''
"cried Dick , as he was helped ashore , `` that makes a life I owe you ."
I swim like a cannon-ball . ''
And he turned instantly towards the island .
"Midway over , Hugh Ferryman was swimming with his upturned boat , while John-a-Fenne , furious at the ill-fortune of his shot , bawled to him to hurry ."
"`` Come , Jack , '' said Shelton , `` run for it !"
"Ere Hugh can hale his barge across , or the pair of 'em can get it righted , we may be out of cry . ''"
"And adding example to his words , he began to run , dodging among the willows , and in marshy places leaping from tussock to tussock ."
"He had no time to look for his direction ; all he could do was to turn his back upon the river , and put all his heart to running ."
"Presently , however , the ground began to rise , which showed him he was still in the right way , and soon after they came forth upon a slope of solid turf , where elms began to mingle with the willows ."
"But here Matcham , who had been dragging far into the rear , threw himself fairly down ."
"`` Leave me , Dick ! ''"
"he cried , pantingly ; `` I can no more . ''"
"Dick turned , and came back to where his companion lay ."
"`` Nay , Jack , leave thee ! ''"
he cried .
"`` That were a knave 's trick , to be sure , when ye risked a shot and a ducking , ay , and a drowning too , to save my life ."
"Drowning , in sooth ; for why I did not pull you in along with me , the saints alone can tell ! ''"
"`` Nay , '' said Matcham , `` I would ` a ' saved us both , good Dick , for I can swim . ''"
`` Can ye so ? ''
"cried Dick , with open eyes ."
It was the one manly accomplishment of which he was himself incapable .
"In the order of the things that he admired , next to having killed a man in single fight came swimming ."
"`` Well , '' he said , `` here is a lesson to despise no man ."
I did n't dare ask him to the house for I knew Anthony was in one of his moods .
But it 's time something was done .
She 's woman grown and this is no life for her .
"And there 's nobody to do anything but me and I 'm not able , even if I knew what to do ."
I wonder why she hates men so .
Perhaps it 's because she never knew any that were real gentlemen .
This man is -- but then he 's a minister and that makes a wide gulf between them in another way .
I 've seen the love of man and woman bridge some wider gulfs though .
"But it ca n't with Lynde , I 'm fearing ."
She 's so bitter at the mere speaking of love and marriage .
I ca n't think why .
"I 'm sure her mother and Anthony were happy together , and that was all she 's ever seen of marriage ."
But I thought when she told me of meeting this young man on the shore there was something in her look I 'd never noticed before -- as if she 'd found something in herself she 'd never known was there .
But she 'll never make friends with him and I ca n't .
"If the Captain was n't so queer -- '' She stopped abruptly , for a tall lithe figure was coming up from the shore ."
Lynde waved her hand as she drew near .
"`` Oh , Emily , I 've had such a splendid sail ."
It was glorious .
"Bad Emily , you 've been carrying water ."
Did n't I tell you never to do that when I was away ? ''
`` I did n't have to do it .
That young minister up at Rexton met me and brought it up .
"He 's nice , Lynde . ''"
Lynde 's brow darkened .
She turned and walked away to the house without a word .
On his way home that night Alan met Isabel King on the main shore road .
She carried an armful of pine boughs and said she wanted the needles for a cushion .
"Yet the thought came into Alan 's mind that she was spying on him and , although he tried to dismiss it as unworthy , it continued to lurk there ."
"For a week he avoided the shore , but there came a day when its inexplicable lure drew him to it again irresistibly ."
"It was a warm , windy evening and the air was sweet and resinous , the lake misty and blue ."
There was no sign of life about Four Winds and the shore seemed as lonely and virgin as if human foot had never trodden it .
"The Captain 's yacht was gone from the little harbour where it was generally anchored and , though every flutter of wind in the scrub firs made Alan 's heart beat expectantly , he saw nothing of Lynde Oliver ."
"`` Whoever it was had better tell , and not wait to be found out , '' said Demi , looking as if an awful misfortune had befallen the family ."
"`` I know you think it 's me , '' broke out Nat , red and excited ."
"`` You are the only one who knew where it was , '' said Franz ."
`` I ca n't help it I did n't take it .
I tell you I did n't I did n't ! ''
"cried Nat , in a desperate sort of way ."
"`` Gently , gently , my son !"
What is all this noise about ? ''
and Mr. Bhaer walked in among them .
"Tommy repeated the story of his loss , and , as he listened , Mr. Bhaer 's face grew graver and graver ; for , with all their faults and follies , the lads till now had been honest ."
"`` Take your seats , '' he said ; and , when all were in their places , he added slowly , as his eye went from face to face with a grieved look , that was harder to bear than a storm of words , `` Now , boys , I shall ask each one of you a single question , and I want an honest answer ."
"I am not going to try to frighten , bribe , or surprise the truth out of you , for every one of you have got a conscience , and know what it is for ."
"Now is the time to undo the wrong done to Tommy , and set yourselves right before us all ."
I can forgive the yielding to sudden temptation much easier than I can deceit .
"Do n't add a lie to the theft , but confess frankly , and we will all try to help you make us forget and forgive . ''"
"He paused a moment , and one might have heard a pin drop , the room was so still ; then slowly and impressively he put the question to each one , receiving the same answer in varying tones from all ."
There is really nothing at all but scenery . ''
"`` Out of your world perhaps , Susan -- but not out of mine , '' said Anne with a faint smile ."
"`` I do not quite understand you , Mrs. Doctor , dear , but of course I am not well educated ."
"But if Dr. Blythe buys the Morgan place he will make no mistake , and that you may tie to ."
"They have water in it , and the pantries and closets are beautiful , and there is not another such cellar in P. E. Island , so I have been told ."
"Why , the cellar here , Mrs. Doctor , dear , has been a heart-break to me , as well you know . ''"
"`` Oh , go away , Susan , go away , '' said Anne forlornly ."
`` Cellars and pantries and closets do n't make a HOME .
Why do n't you weep with those who weep ? ''
"`` Well , I never was much hand for weeping , Mrs. Doctor , dear ."
I would rather fall to and cheer people up than weep with them .
"Now , do not you cry and spoil your pretty eyes ."
"This house is very well and has served your turn , but it is high time you had a better . ''"
Susan 's point of view seemed to be that of most people .
Leslie was the only one who sympathised understandingly with Anne .
"She had a good cry , too , when she heard the news ."
Joanna !
"Nay , by the sacred rood !"
where is she ?
"Host , where is that girl ? ''"
"`` Girl , Sir Daniel ? ''"
cried the landlord .
"`` Nay , sir , I saw no girl . ''"
"`` Boy , then , dotard ! ''"
cried the knight .
`` Could ye not see it was a wench ?
"She in the murrey-coloured mantle -- she that broke her fast with water , rogue -- where is she ? ''"
"`` Nay , the saints bless us !"
"Master John , ye called him , '' said the host ."
"`` Well , I thought none evil ."
He is gone .
I saw him -- her -- I saw her in the stable a good hour agone ; ' a was saddling a grey horse . ''
"`` Now , by the rood ! ''"
"cried Sir Daniel , `` the wench was worth five hundred pound to me and more . ''"
"`` Sir knight , '' observed the messenger , with bitterness , `` while that ye are here , roaring for five hundred pounds , the realm of England is elsewhere being lost and won . ''"
"`` It is well said , '' replied Sir Daniel ."
"`` Selden , fall me out with six cross-bowmen ; hunt me her down ."
"I care not what it cost ; but , at my returning , let me find her at the Moat House ."
Be it upon your head .
"And now , sir messenger , we march . ''"
"And the troop broke into a good trot , and Selden and his six men were left behind upon the street of Kettley , with the staring villagers ."
CHAPTER II -- IN THE FEN It was near six in the May morning when Dick began to ride down into the fen upon his homeward way .
The sky was all blue ; the jolly wind blew loud and steady ; the windmill-sails were spinning ; and the willows over all the fen rippling and whitening like a field of corn .
"He had been all night in the saddle , but his heart was good and his body sound , and he rode right merrily ."
"The path went down and down into the marsh , till he lost sight of all the neighbouring landmarks but Kettley windmill on the knoll behind him , and the extreme top of Tunstall Forest far before ."
"On either hand there were great fields of blowing reeds and willows , pools of water shaking in the wind , and treacherous bogs , as green as emerald , to tempt and to betray the traveller ."
The path lay almost straight through the morass .
"It was already very ancient ; its foundation had been laid by Roman soldiery ; in the lapse of ages much of it had sunk , and every here and there , for a few hundred yards , it lay submerged below the stagnant waters of the fen ."
She always looks as if she 'd just been starched and ironed .
"Well , poor Marilla is going to have her hands full this winter and no mistake ."
"Still , I do n't see that she could do anything less than take them , under the circumstances , and she 'll have Anne to help her ."
"Anne 's tickled to death over the whole business , and she has a real knacky way with children , I must say ."
"Dear me , it does n't seem a day since poor Matthew brought Anne herself home and everybody laughed at the idea of Marilla bringing up a child ."
And now she has adopted twins .
You 're never safe from being surprised till you 're dead . ''
The fat pony jogged over the bridge in Lynde 's Hollow and along the Green Gables lane .
Marilla 's face was rather grim .
It was ten miles from East Grafton and Davy Keith seemed to be possessed with a passion for perpetual motion .
"It was beyond Marilla 's power to make him sit still and she had been in an agony the whole way lest he fall over the back of the wagon and break his neck , or tumble over the dashboard under the pony 's heels ."
In despair she finally threatened to whip him soundly when she got him home .
"Whereupon Davy climbed into her lap , regardless of the reins , flung his chubby arms about her neck and gave her a bear-like hug ."
"`` I do n't believe you mean it , '' he said , smacking her wrinkled cheek affectionately ."
`` You do n't LOOK like a lady who 'd whip a little boy just 'cause he could n't keep still .
Did n't you find it awful hard to keep still when you was only 's old as me ? ''
"`` No , I always kept still when I was told , '' said Marilla , trying to speak sternly , albeit she felt her heart waxing soft within her under Davy 's impulsive caresses ."
"`` Well , I s ` pose that was 'cause you was a girl , '' said Davy , squirming back to his place after another hug ."
"`` You WAS a girl once , I s ` pose , though it 's awful funny to think of it ."
Dora can sit still ... but there ai n't much fun in it I do n't think .
Seems to me it must be slow to be a girl .
"Here , Dora , let me liven you up a bit . ''"
Davy 's method of `` livening up '' was to grasp Dora 's curls in his fingers and give them a tug .
Dora shrieked and then cried .
`` How can you be such a naughty boy and your poor mother just laid in her grave this very day ? ''
demanded Marilla despairingly .
"`` But she was glad to die , '' said Davy confidentially ."
"`` I know , 'cause she told me so ."
She was awful tired of being sick .
We 'd a long talk the night before she died .
She told me you was going to take me and Dora for the winter and I was to be a good boy .
"I 'm going to be good , but ca n't you be good running round just as well as sitting still ?"
But I just want to say something that may help you over the worst when you hear that I 've gone ` west . '
"I 've a premonition about you , Rilla , as well as about myself ."
I think Ken will go back to you -- and that there are long years of happiness for you by-and-by .
"And you will tell your children of the Idea we fought and died for -- teach them it must be lived for as well as died for , else the price paid for it will have been given for nought ."
"This will be part of your work , Rilla ."
"And if you -- all you girls back in the homeland -- do it , then we who do n't come back will know that you have not ` broken faith ' with us ."
"`` I meant to write to Una tonight , too , but I wo n't have time now ."
"Read this letter to her and tell her it 's really meant for you both -- you two dear , fine loyal girls ."
"Tomorrow , when we go over the top -- I 'll think of you both -- of your laughter , Rilla-my-Rilla , and the steadfastness in Una 's blue eyes -- somehow I see those eyes very plainly tonight , too ."
"Yes , you 'll both keep faith -- I 'm sure of that -- you and Una ."
And so -- goodnight .
We go over the top at dawn . ''
Rilla read her letter over many times .
"There was a new light on her pale young face when she finally stood up , amid the asters Walter had loved , with the sunshine of autumn around her ."
"For the moment at least , she was lifted above pain and loneliness ."
"`` I will keep faith , Walter , '' she said steadily ."
"`` I will work -- and teach -- and learn -- and laugh , yes , I will even laugh -- through all my years , because of you and because of what you gave when you followed the call . ''"
Rilla meant to keep Walter 's letter as a a sacred treasure .
"But , seeing the look on Una Meredith 's face when Una had read it and held it back to her , she thought of something ."
Could she do it ?
"Oh , no , she could not give up Walter 's letter -- his last letter ."
Surely it was not selfishness to keep it .
A copy would be such a soulless thing .
"But Una -- Una had so little -- and her eyes were the eyes of a woman stricken to the heart , who yet must not cry out or ask for sympathy ."
"`` Una , would you like to have this letter -- to keep ? ''"
she asked slowly .
"`` Yes -- if you can give it to me , '' Una said dully ."
"`` Then -- you may have it , '' said Rilla hurriedly ."
"`` Thank you , '' said Una ."
"It was all she said , but there was something in her voice which repaid Rilla for her bit of sacrifice ."
Una took the letter and when Rilla had gone she pressed it against her lonely lips .
Una knew that love would never come into her life now -- it was buried for ever under the blood-stained soil `` Somewhere in France . ''
This was seeing ; it was not hearing .
He means foully .
"Hark , else , if his bell be not stopped ! ''"
Such was the case .
The bell rang no longer .
"`` Nay , '' said Dick , `` I like not that ."
"Nay , '' he cried again , `` I like that little ."
What may this betoken ?
"Let us go , by the mass ! ''"
"`` He hath gone east , '' added Matcham ."
"`` Good Dick , let us go westward straight ; I shall not breathe till I have my back turned upon that leper . ''"
"`` Jack , y ' are too cowardly , '' replied Dick ."
"`` We shall go fair for Holywood , or as fair , at least , as I can guide you , and that will be due north . ''"
"They were afoot at once , passed the stream upon some stepping-stones , and began to mount on the other side , which was steeper , towards the margin of the wood ."
"The ground became very uneven , full of knolls and hollows ; trees grew scattered or in clumps ; it became difficult to choose a path , and the lads somewhat wandered ."
"They were weary , besides , with yesterday 's exertions and the lack of food , and they moved but heavily and dragged their feet among the sand ."
"Presently , coming to the top of a knoll , they were aware of the leper , some hundred feet in front of them , crossing the line of their march by a hollow ."
"His bell was silent , his staff no longer tapped the ground , and he went before him with the swift and assured footsteps of a man who sees ."
Next moment he had disappeared into a little thicket .
"The lads , at the first glimpse , had crouched behind a tuft of gorse ; there they lay , horror-struck ."
"`` Certain , he pursueth us , '' said Dick -- `` certain !"
"He held the clapper of his bell in one hand , saw ye ?"
that it should not sound .
"Now may the saints aid and guide us , for I have no strength to combat pestilence ! ''"
`` What maketh he ? ''
cried Matcham .
`` What doth he want ?
"Who ever heard the like , that a leper , out of mere malice , should pursue unfortunates ?"
"Hath he not his bell to that very end , that people may avoid him ?"
"Dick , there is below this something deeper . ''"
"`` Nay , I care not , '' moaned Dick ; `` the strength is gone out of me ; my legs are like water ."
The saints be mine assistance ! ''
was the answer .
"`` Howsoever , so be it , amen ! ''"
"After a little while of silence , he said he thought somebody might read a prayer ."
"`` It 's the custom , sir , '' he added apologetically ."
"And not long after , without another word , he passed away ."
"In the meantime the captain , whom I had observed to be wonderfully swollen about the chest and pockets , had turned out a great many various stores -- the British colours , a Bible , a coil of stoutish rope , pen , ink , the log-book , and pounds of tobacco ."
"He had found a longish fir-tree lying felled and trimmed in the enclosure , and with the help of Hunter he had set it up at the corner of the log-house where the trunks crossed and made an angle ."
"Then , climbing on the roof , he had with his own hand bent and run up the colours ."
This seemed mightily to relieve him .
He re-entered the log-house and set about counting up the stores as if nothing else existed .
"But he had an eye on Tom 's passage for all that , and as soon as all was over , came forward with another flag and reverently spread it on the body ."
"`` Do n't you take on , sir , '' he said , shaking the squire 's hand ."
`` All 's well with him ; no fear for a hand that 's been shot down in his duty to captain and owner .
"It may n't be good divinity , but it 's a fact . ''"
Then he pulled me aside .
"`` Dr. Livesey , '' he said , `` in how many weeks do you and squire expect the consort ? ''"
"I told him it was a question not of weeks but of months , that if we were not back by the end of August Blandly was to send to find us , but neither sooner nor later ."
"`` You can calculate for yourself , '' I said ."
"`` Why , yes , '' returned the captain , scratching his head ; `` and making a large allowance , sir , for all the gifts of Providence , I should say we were pretty close hauled . ''"
`` How do you mean ? ''
I asked .
"`` It 's a pity , sir , we lost that second load ."
"That 's what I mean , '' replied the captain ."
"`` As for powder and shot , we 'll do ."
"But the rations are short , very short -- so short , Dr. Livesey , that we 're perhaps as well without that extra mouth . ''"
And he pointed to the dead body under the flag .
"Just then , with a roar and a whistle , a round-shot passed high above the roof of the log-house and plumped far beyond us in the wood ."
`` Oho ! ''
said the captain .
`` Blaze away !
"You 've little enough powder already , my lads . ''"
"At the second trial , the aim was better , and the ball descended inside the stockade , scattering a cloud of sand but doing no further damage ."
"But cast with what skill he might , it availed nothing , for the salmon would not even look at the bait . '"
"I am beaten at last , unless the Doran-donn can deliver me , ' he cried ."
"And as he spoke there was a swish of the water , and the face of the Doran-donn looked up at him . '"
"O catch me , I pray you , that salmon under the rock ! '"
said Covan son of Gorla .
"And the Doran-donn dived , and laying hold of the salmon by his tail , bore it back to the place where Covan was standing ."
"` The roe , and the duck , and the salmon are here , ' said Covan to the old man , when he reached the cottage ."
"And the old man smiled on him and bade him eat and drink , and after he hungered no more , he would speak with him ."
"And this was what the old man said : ` You began well , my son , so things have gone well with you ."
"You set store by your mother 's blessing , therefore you have been blest ."
"You gave food to the raven when it hungered , you were true to the promise you had made to me , and did not suffer yourself to be turned aside by vain shows ."
"You were skilled to perceive that the boy who tempted you to leave the temple was a teller of false tales , and took with a grateful heart what the poor had to offer you ."
"Last of all , difficulties gave you courage , instead of lending you despair ."
"And now , as to your reward , you shall in truth take your sister home with you , and your brothers I will restore to life ; but idle and unfaithful as they are their lot is to wander for ever ."
"And so farewell , and may wisdom be with you . '"
` First tell me your name ? '
asked Covan softly . '
"I am the Spirit of Age , ' said the old man ."
The Princess Bella-Flor -LSB- Taken from a Celtic Story .
Translated by Doctor Macleod Clarke . -RSB-
Once upon a time there lived a man who had two sons .
"When they grew up the elder went to seek his fortune in a far country , and for many years no one heard anything about him ."
"Meanwhile the younger son stayed at home with his father , who died at last in a good old age , leaving great riches behind him ."
"For some time the son who stayed at home spent his father 's wealth freely , believing that he alone remained to enjoy it ."
"But , one day , as he was coming down stairs , he was surprised to see a stranger enter the hall , looking about as if the house belonged to him ."
` Have you forgotten me ? '
asked the man . '
"I ca n't forget a person I have never known , ' was the rude answer . '"
"I am your brother , ' replied the stranger , ` and I have returned home without the money I hoped to have made ."
"And , what is worse , they tell me in the village that my father is dead ."
I would have counted my lost gold as nothing if I could have seen him once more . '
"` He died six months ago , ' said the rich brother , ` and he left you , as your portion , the old wooden chest that stands in the loft ."
"`` Now , men , '' said he , `` do you hear me ? ''"
There was no answer from the forecastle .
"`` It 's to you , Abraham Gray -- it 's to you I am speaking . ''"
Still no reply .
"`` Gray , '' resumed Mr. Smollett , a little louder , `` I am leaving this ship , and I order you to follow your captain ."
"I know you are a good man at bottom , and I dare say not one of the lot of you 's as bad as he makes out ."
I have my watch here in my hand ; I give you thirty seconds to join me in . ''
There was a pause .
"`` Come , my fine fellow , '' continued the captain ; `` do n't hang so long in stays ."
I 'm risking my life and the lives of these good gentlemen every second . ''
"There was a sudden scuffle , a sound of blows , and out burst Abraham Gray with a knife cut on the side of the cheek , and came running to the captain like a dog to the whistle ."
"`` I 'm with you , sir , '' said he ."
"And the next moment he and the captain had dropped aboard of us , and we had shoved off and given way ."
"We were clear out of the ship , but not yet ashore in our stockade ."
17 Narrative Continued by the Doctor : The Jolly-boat 's Last Trip THIS fifth trip was quite different from any of the others .
"In the first place , the little gallipot of a boat that we were in was gravely overloaded ."
"Five grown men , and three of them -- Trelawney , Redruth , and the captain -- over six feet high , was already more than she was meant to carry ."
"Add to that the powder , pork , and bread-bags ."
The gunwale was lipping astern .
"Several times we shipped a little water , and my breeches and the tails of my coat were all soaking wet before we had gone a hundred yards ."
"The captain made us trim the boat , and we got her to lie a little more evenly ."
"All the same , we were afraid to breathe ."
"In the second place , the ebb was now making -- a strong rippling current running westward through the basin , and then south ` ard and seaward down the straits by which we had entered in the morning ."
"Even the ripples were a danger to our overloaded craft , but the worst of it was that we were swept out of our true course and away from our proper landing-place behind the point ."
"If we let the current have its way we should come ashore beside the gigs , where the pirates might appear at any moment ."
"`` I can not keep her head for the stockade , sir , '' said I to the captain ."
"I was steering , while he and Redruth , two fresh men , were at the oars ."
`` The tide keeps washing her down .
Could you pull a little stronger ? ''
"`` Not without swamping the boat , '' said he ."
"`` You must bear up , sir , if you please -- bear up until you see you 're gaining . ''"
"I tried and found by experiment that the tide kept sweeping us westward until I had laid her head due east , or just about right angles to the way we ought to go ."
"So the next afternoon, quite early, long before the beams of sunset announced the coming night, when everybody would be up and working, the two children got out of bed. Effie wrapped herself in a shawl of dragonproof muslin there was no time to make the frock and Harry made a horrid mess of himself with the patent dragon poison. It was warranted harmless to infants and invalids, so he felt quite safe."
"Then they joined hands and set out to walk to St. George's Church. As you know, there are many St. George's churches, but fortunately they took the turning that leads to the right one, and went along in the bright sunlight, feeling very brave and adventurous."
"There was no one about in the streets except dragons, and the place was simply swarming with them. Fortunately none of the dragons were just the right size for eating little boys and girls, or perhaps this story might have had to end here. There were dragons on the pavement, and dragons on the roadway, dragons basking on the front doorsteps of public buildings, and dragons preening their wings on the roofs in the hot afternoon sun."
"The town was quite green with them. Even when the children had gotten out of the town and were walking in the lanes, they noticed that the fields on each side were greener than usual with the scaly legs and tails; and some of the smaller sizes had made themselves asbestos nests in the flowering hawthorn hedges."
"Effie held her brother's hand very tight, and once when a fat dragon flopped against her ear she screamed out, and a whole flight of green dragons rose from the field at the sound, and sprawled away across the sky. The children could hear the rattle of their wings as they flew."
"""Oh, I want to go home,"" said Effie."
"""Don't be silly,"" said Harry. ""Surely you haven't forgotten about the Seven Champions and all the princes. People who are going to be their country's deliverers never scream and say they want to go home."""
"""And are we,"" asked Effie ""deliverers, I mean?"""
"""You'll see,"" said her brother, and on they went."
"When they came to St. George's Church they found the door open, and they walked right in but St. George was not there, so they walked around the churchyard outside, and presently they found the great stone tomb of St."
"George, with the figure of him carved in marble outside, in his armor and helmet, and with his hands folded on his breast."
"""How ever can we wake him?"" they said. Then Harry spoke to St."
"George but he would not answer; and he called, but St. George did not seem to hear; and then he actually tried to waken the great dragon-slayer by shaking his marble shoulders. But St. George took no notice."
"Then Effie began to cry, and she put her arms around St. George's neck as well as she could for the marble, which was very much in the way at the back, and she kissed the marble face, and she said: ""Oh, dear, good, kind St. George, please wake up and help us."""
"And at that St. George opened his eyes sleepily, and stretched himself and said: ""What's the matter, little girl?"""
So the children told him all about it; he turned over in his marble and leaned on one elbow to listen. But when he heard that there were so many dragons he shook his head.
"""It's no good,"" he said, ""they would be one too many for poor old George. You should have waked me before. I was always for a fair fight one man one dragon, was my motto."""
"Just then a flight of dragons passed overhead, and St. George half drew his sword."
But he shook his head again and pushed the sword back as the flight of dragons grew small in the distance.
"""I can't do anything,"" he said. ""Things have changed since my time. St."
"Andrew told me about it. They woke him up over the engineers' strike, and he came to talk to me. He says everything is done by machinery now; there must be some way of settling these dragons. By the way, what sort of weather have you been having lately?"""
"This seemed so careless and unkind that Harry would not answer, but Effie said patiently, ""It has been very fine. Father says it is the hottest weather there has ever been in this country."""
"""Ah, I guessed as much,"" said the Champion, thoughtfully. ""Well, the only thing would be ... dragons can't stand wet and cold, that's the only thing. If you could find the taps."""
St. George was beginning to settle down again on his stone slab.
"""Good night, very sorry I can't help you,"" he said, yawning behind his marble hand."
"""Oh, but you can,"" cried Effie. ""Tell us what taps?"""
"""Oh, like in the bathroom,"" said St. George, still more sleepily. ""And there's a looking glass, too; shows you all the world and what's going on. St. Denis told me about it; said it was a very pretty thing. I'm sorry I can't good night."""
And he fell back into his marble and was fast asleep again in a moment.
"""We shall never find the taps,"" said Harry. ""I say, wouldn't it be awful if St. George woke up when there was a dragon near, the size that eats champions?"""
"Effie pulled off her dragonproof veil. ""We didn't meet any the size of the dining room as we came along,"" she said. ""I daresay we shall be quite safe."""
"So she covered St. George with the veil, and Harry rubbed off as much as he could of the dragon poison onto St. George's armor, so as to make everything quite safe for him."
"""We might hide in the church till it is dark,"" he said, ""and then """
"Now the other forest people would have liked to watch the Bat longer, but after the Ground Hog had gone off in this way, they thought it would show too much curiosity if they stayed. So one after another went away, and the little Bat was left alone. He fluttered around until he reached the branch where the Blue Jay had been, and there he hung himself up to wait until night."
"""Oh dear!"" he said, ""I wonder how long a day is. I am hot and blind and sleepy, and if any more of the forest people come and talk about me, I don't know what I shall do. They don't think me good-looking because my wings grow to my legs. I only wish I could see what they look like. I believe they are just as homely."""
"And then, because he was a very tired little Bat, and cross, as people always are when they have done wrong, he began to blame somebody else for all his trouble."
"""If my father and mother had cared very much about me,"" he said, ""they would never have let me stay up all day. Guess if I were a big Bat and had little Bats of my own, I'd take better care of them!"" But that is always the way, and when, long afterward, he was a big Bat with little Bats of his own, he was a much wiser person."
A SWARM LEAVES THE BEE TREE
"The old Bee tree was becoming very crowded and the Queen-Mother grew restless. There were many things to make her so. In the tree were thousands of cells made ready for her eggs, and she had been busy for days putting one in each. In the larger cells she laid eggs that would hatch out Drones, and in the smaller ones she laid Worker eggs. She never laid any Queen eggs. Perhaps she did not want any Queens among her children, for there can never be two Queens in one swarm, and when a new one is hatched, the Queen-Mother has to go away and find another home."
That is a law among the Bees.
"The Workers, however, knew that there must be young Queens growing up all the time. Supposing something should happen to the Queen-Mother, what would become of the swarm if there were nobody to lay eggs? So after she had laid several thousand Worker eggs, and it was time for the young ones to hatch, they decided to change some of the babies into young Queens. And this was easy enough. When they were out for honey, they filled the pockets on their hind legs with pollen, the yellow dust that is found in flowers. This was to be mixed with honey and water and made into bread for the babies, who were now awake, and looked like tiny white worms in the bottom of their cells. Then they made some that was almost like sour jelly, and put it in a few of the Worker cells for the tiny white worms, or Larvæ, to eat. The Larvæ that eat this jelly grow up to be Queens, and can lay eggs. Those that eat the common bread are either Drones or Workers, whichever their mother had planned them to be."
"After the Larvæ were five or six days old, the Workers shut them up in their cells and stopped feeding them. That was because the Larvæ had other things to do than eat. They had to spin their cocoons, and lie in them until they were grown and ready to come out among the older Bees."
"When a Larva, or Bee baby, has finished its cocoon, and is lying inside, it is called a Pupa, and when a Pupa is full grown and has torn its way out of the cocoon and wax, it is called a Drone, or a Worker, or a Queen."
"Now the Queen-Mother was restless. She could hear the young Queens piping in their cells, and she knew that they wanted to come out and drive her away. She wanted to get to them and stop their piping, but the Workers stood in her way and prevented her. They knew it would not be well for the Queen-Mother to meet her royal children, and when these children tried to come out the Workers covered the doors of their cells with another layer of wax, leaving little holes where they could put out their tongues and be fed."
"This made the Queen-Mother more restless than ever. ""If I cannot do as I wish to with my own children,"" she said, ""I will leave the tree."" And she began walking back and forth as fast as she could, and talked a great deal, and acted almost wild with impatience. The Workers saw how she felt, and part of them decided to go with her. When a Worker made up her mind to go with the Queen-Mother, she showed it by also acting wild and walking back and forth, and talking a great deal, sometimes fluttering her wings very fast. Then she would go for honey, because when Bees are about to swarm they fill their honey-pockets just as full as they can. At times the Queen-Mother would be quiet, and you might almost think that she had given up going. Then suddenly she would grow restless again, and all the Workers who were going with her would act as she did, and they would get so warm with excitement that the air in the tree became quite hot."
"At last the Queen-Mother thought it time to start, and her followers came around her in the tree, and were very still for a minute. Several of the Workers had been flying in circles around the tree, and now they came to the doorway and called. Then all came out, and hovered in the air a few minutes before stopping to rest on a bush near by. When they rested, the first Bee held on to the bush, the next Bee held on to her, and that was the way they did until they were all clinging tightly together in a squirming, dark-brown mass."
"Ah, then the Queen-Mother was happy! She felt that she was young again, and she thought, ""How they love me, these dear Workers!"" She stroked her body with her legs to make herself as fine as possible, and she noticed, with pleasure, how slender she was growing. ""I had thought I should never fly again,"" she said, ""yet this is delightful. I believe I will go off by myself for a little while."""
So she flew off by herself and was talking rather airily to a Butterfly when two of the Workers came after her.
"""You may return to the rest,"" she said in a queenly way, as she motioned to them with her feelers. ""I will come by and by."""
"""No,"" said they, ""you must come at once or we shall all go back to the Bee tree. You must stay with us. You must do your part as it should be done."" And she had to go, for she knew in her heart that Queens have to obey the law as well as other people."
"After she had hung with the Workers on the bush for some time, the ones who had gone ahead to find a new home for the swarm came back and gave the signal for the rest to follow. They went to an old log near the river-bank, and here they began the real work. Crawling through an opening at one end, they found a roomy place within, and commenced to clean house at once."
"""If there is anything I do like,"" said a Worker, as she dropped a splinter of rotten wood outside the door, ""it is house-cleaning."""
"""So do I,"" said her sister. ""But what a fuss the Drones always make when we try to do anything of the sort! A pretty-looking home we'd have if they took care of it!"""
"""I'm glad none of them came with us to this place,"" said the first Worker. ""I guess they knew they were not wanted."""
"""There, there!"" said the Queen-Mother, coming up to where they were; ""you must not talk in that way. It may be that you would rather do without Drones, and perhaps they would rather do without you; but I need you both and I will not have any quarreling."" When she said this she walked away with her head in the air, and the Workers did not scold any more. They knew that she was right, and, after all, she was their Queen, even if she did have to obey the laws."
"Next they got varnish from the buds of poplar trees and varnished over all the cracks and little holes in the walls of their home, leaving open only the place where they were to go in and out. They also covered with varnish a few heavy fragments of wood that lay on the floor of their home, and when this task was done it was all in order and ready for the furniture, that is, the comb."
"You know how the comb looks, and you know how they get the wax from which to make it, but unless you are acquainted with the Bees, and have seen them at work, you have no idea what busy creatures they are. The Queen-Mother, as soon as the cells were ready and she could begin laying eggs again, was as contented and happy as ever."
"One day, when she was walking around a corner of the comb, she ran against a sad and discouraged-looking Worker. ""Why, what is the matter?"""
"said she, kindly. ""Are you sick?"""
"""No,"" answered the Worker. ""I'm not sick and I'm not tired, only I want to get through."""
"""Through with what?"" asked the Queen."
"""With work! It is clean house, varnish the walls, make wax, build combs, get honey, make bread and jelly, and feed the babies. And when they get old enough they'll have to clean house, varnish the walls, make wax, build combs, get honey, make bread and jelly, and feed the babies. I want to know when it is going to stop, and Bees can spend their time in play."""
"""Never,"" said the Queen-Mother; and she spoke very gently, for she saw that the Worker was crazy. ""It will never stop. If you had nothing to do but play all your life you would soon want to die, and you ought to, for there is no place in this world for idlers. You know that after a while the Drones die because they do nothing, and it is right they should."""
"""Don't you ever get tired of your eggs?"" asked the Worker."
"""Now the time is up,"" bawled the King; ""come hither, headsman, and take off his head."""
"""Nay, nay!"" said the lad; ""stop a bit, there are still three minutes!"
"Out with the key, and let me get into this house."""
"But there stood the King and fumbled with his keys, to draw out the time. At last he said he hadn't any key."
"""Well, if you haven't, I have,"" said the lad, as he gave the door such a kick that it flew to splinters inwards on the floor."
"At the door the Princess met him, and told her father this was her deliverer, on whom her heart was set. So she had him; and this was how the beggar boy came to marry the daughter of the King of Arabia."
PRINCE LINDWORM
"Once upon a time, there was a fine young King who was married to the loveliest of Queens. They were exceedingly happy, all but for one thing they had no children. And this often made them both sad, because the Queen wanted a dear little child to play with, and the King wanted an heir to the kingdom."
"One day the Queen went out for a walk by herself, and she met an ugly old woman. The old woman was just like a witch: but she was a nice kind of witch, not the cantankerous sort. She said, ""Why do you look so doleful, pretty lady?"" ""It's no use my telling you,"" answered the Queen, ""nobody in the world can help me."" ""Oh, you never know,"""
"said the old woman. ""Just you let me hear what your trouble is, and maybe I can put things right."""
"""My dear woman, how can you?"" said the Queen: and she told her, ""The King and I have no children: that's why I am so distressed."" ""Well, you needn't be,"" said the old witch. ""I can set that right in a twinkling, if only you will do exactly as I tell you. Listen."
"To-night, at sunset, take a little drinking-cup with two ears"" (that is, handles), ""and put it bottom upwards on the ground in the north-west corner of your garden. Then go and lift it up to-morrow morning at sunrise, and you will find two roses underneath it, one red and one white. If you eat the red rose, a little boy will be born to you: if you eat the white rose, a little girl will be sent. But, whatever you do, you mustn't eat both the roses, or you'll be sorry, that I warn you! Only one: remember that!"" ""Thank you a thousand times,"" said the Queen, ""this is good news indeed!"" And she wanted to give the old woman her gold ring; but the old woman wouldn't take it."
"So the Queen went home and did as she had been told: and next morning at sunrise she stole out into the garden and lifted up the little drinking-cup. She was surprised, for indeed she had hardly expected to see anything. But there were the two roses underneath it, one red and one white. And now she was dreadfully puzzled, for she did not know which to choose. ""If I choose the red one,"" she thought, ""and I have a little boy, he may grow up and go to the wars and get killed."
"But if I choose the white one, and have a little girl, she will stay at home awhile with us, but later on she will get married and go away and leave us. So, whichever it is, we may be left with no child after all."""
"However, at last she decided on the white rose, and she ate it. And it tasted so sweet, that she took and ate the red one too: without ever remembering the old woman's solemn warning."
"Some time after this, the King went away to the wars: and while he was still away, the Queen became the mother of twins. One was a lovely baby-boy, and the other was a Lindworm, or Serpent. She was terribly frightened when she saw the Lindworm, but he wriggled away out of the room, and nobody seemed to have seen him but herself: so that she thought it must have been a dream. The baby Prince was so beautiful and so healthy, the Queen was full of joy: and likewise, as you may suppose, was the King when he came home and found his son and heir. Not a word was said by anyone about the Lindworm: only the Queen thought about it now and then."
"Many days and years passed by, and the baby grew up into a handsome young Prince, and it was time that he got married. The King sent him off to visit foreign kingdoms, in the Royal coach, with six white horses, to look for a Princess grand enough to be his wife. But at the very first cross-roads, the way was stopped by an enormous Lindworm, enough to frighten the bravest. He lay in the middle of the road with a great wide open mouth, and cried, ""A bride for me before a bride for you!"" Then the Prince made the coach turn round and try another road: but it was all no use. For, at the first cross-ways, there lay the Lindworm again, crying out, ""A bride for me before a bride for you!"" So the Prince had to turn back home again to the Castle, and give up his visits to the foreign kingdoms. And his mother, the Queen, had to confess that what the Lindworm said was true. For he was really the eldest of her twins: and so he ought to have a wedding first."
"There seemed nothing for it but to find a bride for the Lindworm, if his younger brother, the Prince, were to be married at all. So the King wrote to a distant country, and asked for a Princess to marry his son (but, of course, he didn't say which son), and presently a Princess arrived. But she wasn't allowed to see her bridegroom until he stood by her side in the great hall and was married to her, and then, of course, it was too late for her to say she wouldn't have him."
But next morning the Princess had disappeared. The Lindworm lay sleeping all alone: and it was quite plain that he had eaten her.
"A little while after, the Prince decided that he might now go journeying again in search of a Princess. And off he drove in the Royal chariot with the six white horses. But at the first cross-ways, there lay the Lindworm, crying with his great wide open mouth, ""A bride for me before a bride for you!"" So the carriage tried another road, and the same thing happened, and they had to turn back again this time, just as formerly. And the King wrote to several foreign countries, to know if anyone would marry his son. At last another Princess arrived, this time from a very far distant land. And, of course, she was not allowed to see her future husband before the wedding took place, and then, lo and behold! it was the Lindworm who stood at her side. And next morning the Princess had disappeared:"
and the Lindworm lay sleeping all alone; and it was quite clear that he had eaten her.
"By and by the Prince started on his quest for the third time: and at the first cross-roads there lay the Lindworm with his great wide open mouth, demanding a bride as before. And the Prince went straight back to the castle, and told the King: ""You must find another bride for my elder brother."""
"""I don't know where I am to find her,"" said the King, ""I have already made enemies of two great Kings who sent their daughters here as brides: and I have no notion how I can obtain a third lady. People are beginning to say strange things, and I am sure no Princess will dare to come."""
"Now, down in a little cottage near a wood, there lived the King's shepherd, an old man with his only daughter. And the King came one day and said to him, ""Will you give me your daughter to marry my son the Lindworm? And I will make you rich for the rest of your life."" ""No, sire,"" said the shepherd, ""that I cannot do. She is my only child, and I want her to take care of me when I am old. Besides, if the Lindworm would not spare two beautiful Princesses, he won't spare her either. He will just gobble her up: and she is much too good for such a fate."""
"But the King wouldn't take ""No"" for an answer: and at last the old man had to give in."
"Well, when the old shepherd told his daughter that she was to be Prince Lindworm's bride, she was utterly in despair. She went out into the woods, crying and wringing her hands and bewailing her hard fate. And while she wandered to and fro, an old witch-woman suddenly appeared out of a big hollow oak-tree, and asked her, ""Why do you look so doleful, pretty lass?"" The shepherd-girl said, ""It's no use my telling you, for nobody in the world can help me."" ""Oh, you never know,"" said the old woman. ""Just you let me hear what your trouble is, and maybe I can put things right."" ""Ah, how can you?"" said the girl, ""For I am to be married to the King's eldest son, who is a Lindworm. He has already married two beautiful Princesses, and devoured them: and he will eat me too! No wonder I am distressed."""
"""Well, you needn't be,"" said the witch-woman. ""All that can be set right in a twinkling: if only you will do exactly as I tell you."" So the girl said she would."
"""Listen, then,"" said the old woman. ""After the marriage ceremony is over, and when it is time for you to retire to rest, you must ask to be dressed in ten snow-white shifts. And you must then ask for a tub full of lye,"" (that is, washing water prepared with wood-ashes) ""and a tub full of fresh milk, and as many whips as a boy can carry in his arms, and have all these brought into your bed-chamber. Then, when the Lindworm tells you to shed a shift, do you bid him slough a skin. And when all his skins are off, you must dip the whips in the lye and whip him; next, you must wash him in the fresh milk; and, lastly, you must take him and hold him in your arms, if it's only for one moment."""
"""The last is the worst notion ugh!"" said the shepherd's daughter, and she shuddered at the thought of holding the cold, slimy, scaly Lindworm."
"""Do just as I have said, and all will go well,"" said the old woman."
Then she disappeared again in the oak-tree.
"When the wedding-day arrived, the girl was fetched in the Royal chariot with the six white horses, and taken to the castle to be decked as a bride. And she asked for ten snow-white shifts to be brought her, and the tub of lye, and the tub of milk, and as many whips as a boy could carry in his arms. The ladies and courtiers in the castle thought, of course, that this was some bit of peasant superstition, all rubbish and nonsense. But the King said, ""Let her have whatever she asks for."" She was then arrayed in the most wonderful robes, and looked the loveliest of brides. She was led to the hall where the wedding ceremony was to take place, and she saw the Lindworm for the first time as he came in and stood by her side. So they were married, and a great wedding-feast was held, a banquet fit for the son of a king."
And he told them all about it.
"But they all happened to have engagements for that evening; so they praised John's cleverness, and said they were quite content to leave the matter in his hands."
"""But what about my baby?"" said John."
"""Oh, well,"" said the mayor, ""if anything should happen, you will always be able to remember that your baby perished in a good cause."""
"So John went home again, and told his wife some of the tale."
"""You've given the baby to the dragon!"" she cried. ""Oh, you unnatural parent!"""
"""Hush,"" said John, and he told her some more. ""Now,"" he said, ""I'm going down. After I've been down you can go, and if you keep your head the boy will be all right."""
"So down went the blacksmith, and there was the dragon purring away with all his might to keep the baby quiet."
"""Hurry up, can't you?"" he said. ""I can't keep up this noise all night."""
"""I'm very sorry, sir,"" said the blacksmith, ""but all the shops are shut."
"The job must wait till the morning. And don't forget you've promised to take care of that baby. You'll find it a little wearing, I'm afraid."
"Good night, sir."""
"The dragon had purred till he was quite out of breath so now he stopped, and as soon as everything was quiet the baby thought everyone must have settled for the night, and that it was time to begin to scream. So it began."
"""Oh, dear,"" said the dragon, ""this is awful."" He patted the baby with his claw, but it screamed more than ever."
"""And I am so tired too,"" said the dragon. ""I did so hope I should have a good night."""
The baby went on screaming.
"""There'll be no peace for me after this,"" said the dragon. ""It's enough to ruin one's nerves. Hush, then did 'ums, then."" And he tried to quiet the baby as if it had been a young dragon. But when he began to sing ""Hush-a-by, Dragon,"" the baby screamed more and more and more. ""I can't keep it quiet,"" said the dragon; and then suddenly he saw a woman sitting on the steps. ""Here, I say,"" said he, ""do you know anything about babies?"""
"""I do, a little,"" said the mother."
"""Then I wish you'd take this one, and let me get some sleep,"" said the dragon, yawning. ""You can bring it back in the morning before the blacksmith comes."""
"So the mother picked up the baby and took it upstairs and told her husband, and they went to bed happy, for they had caught the dragon and saved the baby."
"And next day John went down and explained carefully to the dragon exactly how matters stood, and he got an iron gate with a grating to it and set it up at the foot of the steps, and the dragon mewed furiously for days and days, but when he found it was no good he was quiet."
"So now John went to the mayor, and said: ""I've got the dragon and I've saved the town."""
"""Noble preserver,"" cried the mayor, ""we will get up a subscription for you, and crown you in public with a laurel wreath."""
"So the mayor put his name down for five pounds, and the corporation each gave three, and other people gave their guineas and half guineas and half crowns and crowns, and while the subscription was being made the mayor ordered three poems at his own expense from the town poet to celebrate the occasion. The poems were very much more admired, especially by the mayor and corporation."
"The first poem dealt with the noble conduct of the mayor in arranging to have the dragon tied up. The second described the splendid assistance rendered by the corporation. And the third expressed the pride and joy of the poet in being permitted to sing such deeds, beside which the actions of St. George must appear quite commonplace to all with a feeling heart or a well-balanced brain."
"When the subscription was finished there was a thousand pounds, and a committee was formed to settle what should be done with it. A third of it went to pay for a banquet to the mayor and corporation; another third was spent in buying a gold collar with a dragon on it for the mayor and gold medals with dragons on them for the corporation; and what was left went in committee expenses."
"So there was nothing for the blacksmith except the laurel wreath and the knowledge that it really was he who had saved the town. But after this things went a little better with the blacksmith. To begin with, the baby did not cry so much as it had before. Then the rich lady who owned the goat was so touched by John's noble action that she ordered a complete set of shoes at 2 shillings, 4 pence, and even made it up to 2 shillings, 6 pence, in grateful recognition of his public-spirited conduct. Then tourists used to come in breaks from quite a long way off, and pay twopence each to go down the steps and peep through the iron grating at the rusty dragon in the dungeon and it was threepence extra for each party if the blacksmith let off colored fire to see it by, which, as the fire was extremely short, was twopence-halfpenny clear profit every time. And the blacksmith's wife used to provide teas at ninepence a head, and altogether things grew brighter week by week."
"The baby named John, after his father, and called Johnnie for short began presently to grow up. He was great friends with Tina, the daughter of the whitesmith, who lived nearly opposite. She was a dear little girl with yellow pigtails and blue eyes, and she was tired of hearing the story of how Johnnie, when he was a baby, had been minded by a real dragon."
"The two children used to go together to peep through the iron grating at the dragon, and sometimes they would hear him mew piteously. And they would light a halfpenny's worth of colored fire to look at him by. And they grew older and wiser."
"At last one day the mayor and corporation, hunting the hare in their gold gowns, came screaming back to the town gates with the news that a lame, humpy giant, as big as a tin church, was coming over the marshes toward the town."
"""We're lost,"" said the mayor. ""I'd give a thousand pounds to anyone who could keep that giant out of the town. I know what he eats by his teeth."""
"No one seemed to know what to do. But Johnnie and Tina were listening, and they looked at each other, and ran off as fast as their boots would carry them."
"Some of them were moved even to tears, for the fiddle seemed to wail as one in bitter anguish. The elder brother wished to purchase it, and offered to support the Jogi for a whole year if he would consent to part with his wonderful instrument. The Jogi, however, knew its value, and refused to sell it."
"It so happened that the Jogi some time after went to the house of a village chief, and after playing a tune or two on his fiddle asked for something to eat. They offered to buy his fiddle and promised a high price for it, but he refused to sell it, as his fiddle brought to him his means of livelihood. When they saw that he was not to be prevailed upon, they gave him food and a plentiful supply of liquor. Of the latter he drank so freely that he presently became intoxicated. While he was in this condition, they took away his fiddle, and substituted their own old one for it. When the Jogi recovered, he missed his instrument, and suspecting that it had been stolen asked them to return it to him. They denied having taken it, so he had to depart, leaving his fiddle behind him. The chief's son, being a musician, used to play on the Jogi's fiddle, and in his hands the music it gave forth delighted the ears of all who heard it."
"When all the household were absent at their labours in the fields, the Bonga girl used to come out of the bamboo fiddle, and prepared the family meal. Having eaten her own share, she placed that of the chief's son under his bed, and covering it up to keep off the dust, re-entered the fiddle. This happening every day, the other members of the household thought that some girl friend of theirs was in this manner showing her interest in the young man, so they did not trouble themselves to find out how it came about. The young chief, however, was determined to watch, and see which of his girl friends was so attentive to his comfort. He said in his own mind, ""I will catch her to-day, and give her a sound beating; she is causing me to be ashamed before the others."" So saying, he hid himself in a corner in a pile of firewood. In a short time the girl came out of the bamboo fiddle, and began to dress her hair. Having completed her toilet, she cooked the meal of rice as usual, and having eaten some herself, she placed the young man's portion under his bed, as before, and was about to enter the fiddle again, when he, running out from his hiding-place, caught her in his arms. The Bonga girl exclaimed, ""Fie! Fie! you may be a Dom, or you may be a Hadi of some other caste with whom I cannot marry."" He said, ""No. But from to-day, you and I are one."" So they began lovingly to hold converse with each other. When the others returned home in the evening, they saw that she was both a human being and a Bonga, and they rejoiced exceedingly."
"Now in course of time the Bonga girl's family became very poor, and her brothers on one occasion came to the chief's house on a visit."
"The Bonga girl recognised them at once, but they did not know who she was. She brought them water on their arrival, and afterwards set cooked rice before them. Then sitting down near them, she began in wailing tones to upbraid them on account of the treatment she had been subjected to by their wives. She related all that had befallen her, and wound up by saying, ""You must have known it all, and yet you did not interfere to save me."" And that was all the revenge she took."
The Cruel Crane Outwitted
Long ago the Bodisat was born to a forest life as the Genius of a tree standing near a certain lotus pond.
"Now at that time the water used to run short at the dry season in a certain pond, not over large, in which there were a good many fish."
And a crane thought on seeing the fish:
"""I must outwit these fish somehow or other and make a prey of them."""
"And he went and sat down at the edge of the water, thinking how he should do it."
"When the fish saw him, they asked him, ""What are you sitting there for, lost in thought?"""
"""I am sitting thinking about you,"" said he."
"""Oh, sir! what are you thinking about us?"" said they."
"""Why,"" he replied; ""there is very little water in this pond, and but little for you to eat; and the heat is so great! So I was thinking, 'What in the world will these fish do now?'"""
"""Yes, indeed, sir! what are we to do?"" said they."
"""If you will only do as I bid you, I will take you in my beak to a fine large pond, covered with all the kinds of lotuses, and put you into it,"" answered the crane."
"""That a crane should take thought for the fishes is a thing unheard of, sir, since the world began. It's eating us, one after the other, that you're aiming at."""
"""Not I! So long as you trust me, I won't eat you. But if you don't believe me that there is such a pond, send one of you with me to go and see it."""
"Then they trusted him, and handed over to him one of their number a big fellow, blind of one eye, whom they thought sharp enough in any emergency, afloat or ashore."
"Him the crane took with him, let him go in the pond, showed him the whole of it, brought him back, and let him go again close to the other fish. And he told them all the glories of the pond."
"And when they heard what he said, they exclaimed, ""All right, sir! You may take us with you."""
"Then the crane took the old purblind fish first to the bank of the other pond, and alighted in a Varana-tree growing on the bank there."
"But he threw it into a fork of the tree, struck it with his beak, and killed it; and then ate its flesh, and threw its bones away at the foot of the tree. Then he went back and called out:"
"""I've thrown that fish in; let another one come."""
"And in that manner he took all the fish, one by one, and ate them, till he came back and found no more!"
"But there was still a crab left behind there; and the crane thought he would eat him too, and called out:"
"""I say, good crab, I've taken all the fish away, and put them into a fine large pond. Come along. I'll take you too!"""
"""But how will you take hold of me to carry me along?"""
"""I'll bite hold of you with my beak."""
repeated Punchkin.
"""Not so fast, my master,"" rejoined the Prince; ""I must first beg that you will restore to life all whom you have thus imprisoned."""
"The Magician immediately waved his wand again; and, whilst he cried, in an imploring voice, ""Give me my parrot!"" the whole garden became suddenly alive: where rocks, and stones, and trees had been before, stood Rajas, and Punts, and Sirdars, and mighty men on prancing horses, and jewelled pages, and troops of armed attendants."
"""Give me my parrot!"" cried Punchkin. Then the boy took hold of the parrot, and tore off one of its wings; and as he did so the Magician's right arm fell off."
"Punchkin then stretched out his left arm, crying, ""Give me my parrot!"""
"The Prince pulled off the parrot's second wing, and the Magician's left arm tumbled off."
"""Give me my parrot!"" cried he, and fell on his knees. The Prince pulled off the parrot's right leg, the Magician's right leg fell off:"
"the Prince pulled off the parrot's left leg, down fell the Magician's left."
"Nothing remained of him save the limbless body and the head; but still he rolled his eyes, and cried, ""Give me my parrot!"" ""Take your parrot, then,"" cried the boy, and with that he wrung the bird's neck, and threw it at the Magician; and, as he did so, Punchkin's head twisted round, and, with a fearful groan, he died!"
"Then they let Balna out of the tower; and she, her son, and the seven Princes went to their own country, and lived very happily ever afterwards. And as to the rest of the world, every one went to his own house."
The Broken Pot
"There lived in a certain place a Brahman, whose name was Svabhavakripana, which means ""a born miser."" He had collected a quantity of rice by begging, and after having dined off it, he filled a pot with what was left over. He hung the pot on a peg on the wall, placed his couch beneath, and looking intently at it all the night, he thought, ""Ah, that pot is indeed brimful of rice. Now, if there should be a famine, I should certainly make a hundred rupees by it. With this I shall buy a couple of goats. They will have young ones every six months, and thus I shall have a whole herd of goats. Then, with the goats, I shall buy cows. As soon as they have calved, I shall sell the calves. Then, with the calves, I shall buy buffaloes; with the buffaloes, mares. When the mares have foaled, I shall have plenty of horses; and when I sell them, plenty of gold. With that gold I shall get a house with four wings. And then a Brahman will come to my house, and will give me his beautiful daughter, with a large dowry. She will have a son, and I shall call him Somasarman."
"When he is old enough to be danced on his father's knee, I shall sit with a book at the back of the stable, and while I am reading, the boy will see me, jump from his mother's lap, and run towards me to be danced on my knee. He will come too near the horse's hoof, and, full of anger, I shall call to my wife, 'Take the baby; take him!' But she, distracted by some domestic work, does not hear me. Then I get up, and give her such a kick with my foot."" While he thought this, he gave a kick with his foot, and broke the pot. All the rice fell over him, and made him quite white. Therefore, I say, ""He who makes foolish plans for the future will be white all over, like the father of Somasarman."""
The Magic Fiddle
"Once upon a time there lived seven brothers and a sister. The brothers were married, but their wives did not do the cooking for the family."
"It was done by their sister, who stopped at home to cook. The wives for this reason bore their sister-in-law much ill-will, and at length they combined together to oust her from the office of cook and general provider, so that one of themselves might obtain it. They said, ""She does not go out to the fields to work, but remains quietly at home, and yet she has not the meals ready at the proper time."" They then called upon their Bonga, and vowing vows unto him they secured his good-will and assistance; then they said to the Bonga, ""At midday when our sister-in-law goes to bring water, cause it thus to happen, that on seeing her pitcher the water shall vanish, and again slowly re-appear. In this way she will be delayed. Let the water not flow into her pitcher, and you may keep the maiden as your own."""
"At noon when she went to bring water, it suddenly dried up before her, and she began to weep. Then after a while the water began slowly to rise. When it reached her ankles she tried to fill her pitcher, but it would not go under the water. Being frightened she began to wail and cry to her brother:"
"""Oh! my brother, the water reaches to my ankles,     Still, Oh! my brother, the pitcher will not dip."""
"The water continued to rise until it reached her knee, when she began to wail again:"
"""Oh! my brother, the water reaches to my knee,     Still, Oh! my brother, the pitcher will not dip."""
"The water continued to rise, and when it reached her waist, she cried again:"
"""Oh! my brother, the water reaches to my waist,     Still, Oh! my brother, the pitcher will not dip."""
"The water still rose, and when it reached her neck she kept on crying:"
"""Oh! my brother, the water reaches to my neck,     Still, Oh! my brother, the pitcher will not dip."""
"At length the water became so deep that she felt herself drowning, then she cried aloud:"
"""Oh! my brother, the water measures a man's height,     Oh! my brother, the pitcher begins to fill."""
"The pitcher filled with water, and along with it she sank and was drowned. The Bonga then transformed her into a Bonga like himself, and carried her off."
"After a time she re-appeared as a bamboo growing on the embankment of the tank in which she had been drowned. When the bamboo had grown to an immense size, a Jogi, who was in the habit of passing that way, seeing it, said to himself, ""This will make a splendid fiddle."" So one day he brought an axe to cut it down; but when he was about to begin, the bamboo called out, ""Do not cut at the root, cut higher up."" When he lifted his axe to cut high up the stem, the bamboo cried out, ""Do not cut near the top, cut at the root."" When the Jogi again prepared himself to cut at the root as requested, the bamboo said, ""Do not cut at the root, cut higher up;"" and when he was about to cut higher up, it again called out to him, ""Do not cut high up, cut at the root."" The Jogi by this time felt sure that a Bonga was trying to frighten him, so becoming angry he cut down the bamboo at the root, and taking it away made a fiddle out of it. The instrument had a superior tone and delighted all who heard it. The Jogi carried it with him when he went a-begging, and through the influence of its sweet music he returned home every evening with a full wallet."
"He now and then visited, when on his rounds, the house of the Bonga girl's brothers, and the strains of the fiddle affected them greatly."
"""Nay, but you have been in here,"" said he; ""and now you shall lose your life."""
"Then the lad begged and prayed so hard that he got off with his life, but the man gave him a good thrashing. And when it was over, they were as good friends as ever."
"Some time after the man set off again, and said he should be away fourteen days; but before he went he forbade the lad to go into any of the rooms he had not been in before; as for that he had been in, he might go into that, and welcome. Well, it was the same story over again, except that the lad stood out eight days before he went in. In this room, too, he saw nothing but a shelf over the door, and a big stone, and a pitcher of water on it. Well, after all, there's not much to be afraid of my seeing here, thought the lad."
"But when the man came back, he asked if he had been into any of the rooms. No, the lad hadn't done anything of the kind."
"""Well, well; I'll soon see that,"" said the man; and when he saw the lad had been in them after all, he said:"
"""Ah! now I'll spare you no longer; now you must lose your life."""
"But the lad begged and prayed for himself again, and so this time too he got off with stripes; though he got as many as his skin would carry. But when he got sound and well again, he led just as easy a life as ever, and he and the man were just as good friends."
"So a while after the man was to take another journey, and now he said he should be away three weeks, and he forbade the lad anew to go into the third room, for if he went in there he might just make up his mind at once to lose his life. Then after fourteen days the lad couldn't bear it, but crept into the room, but he saw nothing at all in there but a trap door on the floor; and when he lifted it up and looked down, there stood a great copper cauldron which bubbled up and boiled away down there; but he saw no fire under it."
"""Well, I should just like to know if it's hot,"" thought the lad, and struck his finger down into the broth, and when he pulled it out again, lo! it was gilded all over. So the lad scraped and scrubbed it, but the gilding wouldn't go off, so he bound a piece of rag round it; and when the man came back, and asked what was the matter with his finger, the lad said he'd given it such a bad cut. But the man tore off the rag, and then he soon saw what was the matter with the finger."
"First he wanted to kill the lad outright, but when he wept, and begged, he only gave him such a thrashing that he had to keep his bed three days. After that the man took down a pot from the wall, and rubbed him over with some stuff out of it, and so the lad was as sound and fresh as ever."
"So after a while the man started off again, and this time he was to be away a month. But before he went, he said to the lad, if he went into the fourth room he might give up all hope of saving his life."
"Well, the lad stood out for two or three weeks, but then he couldn't hold out any longer; he must and would go into that room, and so in he stole. There stood a great black horse tied up in a stall by himself, with a manger of red-hot coals at his head and a truss of hay at his tail. Then the lad thought this all wrong, so he changed them about, and put the hay at his head. Then said the Horse:"
"""Since you are so good at heart as to let me have some food, I'll set you free, that I will. For if the Troll comes back and finds you here, he'll kill you outright. But now you must go up to the room which lies just over this, and take a coat of mail out of those that hang there; and mind, whatever you do, don't take any of the bright ones, but the most rusty of all you see, that's the one to take; and sword and saddle you must choose for yourself just in the same way."""
So the lad did all that; but it was a heavy load for him to carry them all down at once.
"When he came back, the Horse told him to pull off his clothes and get into the cauldron which stood and boiled in the other room, and bathe himself there. ""If I do,"" thought the lad, ""I shall look an awful fright;"" but for all that, he did as he was told. So when he had taken his bath, he became so handsome and sleek, and as red and white as milk and blood, and much stronger than he had been before."
"""Do you feel any change?"" asked the Horse."
"""Yes,"" said the lad."
"""Try and lift me, then,"" said the Horse."
"Oh yes! he could do that, and as for the sword, he brandished it like a feather."
"""Now saddle me,"" said the Horse, ""and put on the coat of mail, and then take the bramble-bush rod, and the stone, and the pitcher of water, and the pot of ointment, and then we'll be off as fast as we can."""
"So when the lad had got on the horse, off they went at such a rate, he couldn't at all tell how they went. But when he had ridden awhile, the Horse said, ""I think I hear a noise; look round! can you see anything?"""
"""Yes; there are ever so many coming after us, at least a score,"" said the lad."
"""Aye, aye, that's the Troll coming,"" said the Horse; ""now he's after us with his pack."""
"So they rode on a while, until those who followed were close behind them."
"""Now throw your bramble-bush rod behind you, over your shoulder,"" said the Horse; ""but mind you throw it a good way off my back."""
"So the lad did that, and all at once a close, thick bramblewood grew up behind them. So the lad rode on a long, long time, while the Troll and his crew had to go home to fetch something to hew their way through the wood. But at last the Horse said again:"
"""Look behind you! can you see anything now?"""
"""Yes, ever so many,"" said the lad, ""as many as would fill a large church."""
"""Aye, aye, that's the Troll and his crew,"" said the Horse; ""now he's got more to back him; but now throw down the stone, and mind you throw it far behind me."""
"And as soon as the lad did what the Horse said, up rose a great black hill of rock behind him. So the Troll had to be off home to fetch something to mine his way through the rock; and while the Troll did that, the lad rode a good bit further on. But still the Horse begged him to look behind him, and then he saw a troop like a whole army behind him, and they glistened in the sunbeams."
"""Aye, aye,"" said the Horse, ""that's the Troll, and now he's got his whole band with him, so throw the pitcher of water behind you, but mind you don't spill any of it upon me."""
"One night, after they had both been flying through forest and over field, he came back to the hollow tree to rest. He expected to find Mrs."
"Owl, for she had started home before he did. She was not there and he grew quite impatient. ""I should like to know what keeps her so long,"" he said, fretfully. After a while he looked into the nest and saw the two big white eggs. ""It is a shame,"" he said. ""Our beautiful eggs will be chilled, and it will be all her fault if we have no Owlets this summer."""
"You see, even then he did not seem to think that he could do anything to keep them warm. But the next time he looked in, he put one feathered foot on the round eggs and was surprised to find how cool they were."
"It fairly made his head feathers stand on end to think of it, and he was so frightened that he forgot to be cross, and stepped right in and covered them with his own breast. What if they had already been left too long, and the Owlets within would never hatch? Would Mrs. Owl ever forgive him for being so stupid? He began to wonder if any of the other fellows would see him. He thought it so absurd for the king of the forest to be hatching out a couple of eggs, instead of swooping around in the dark and frightening the smaller birds."
"The night seemed so long, too. It had always been short enough before, and he had often disliked to have daylight come, for then he had to go to bed. He was very much upset, and it is no wonder that when he heard a doleful wail from a neighboring tree, and knew that his cousin, the Screech Owl, was near, he raised his head and called loudly, ""Hoo-hoo-oooo! Waugh-hoo!"""
"The Screech Owl heard him and flew at once to a branch beside the nest hollow. He was a jolly little fellow in spite of his doleful call, and before he could talk at all he had to bend his body, look behind him, nod his head, and shake himself, as Screech Owls always do when they alight. Then he looked into the tree and saw his big cousin, the Great Horned Owl, the night king of the forest, sitting on the eggs and looking very, very grumpy. How he did laugh! ""What is the matter?"" said he. ""Didn't you like your wife's way of brooding over the eggs? Or did she get tired of staying at home and make you help tend the nest?"""
"""Matter enough,"" grumbled the Great Horned Owl. ""We went hunting together at twilight and she hasn't come home yet. I didn't get into the nest until I had to, but it was growing very cold and I wouldn't miss having our eggs hatch for anything. Ugh-whoo! How my legs do ache!"""
"""Well,"" said his cousin, ""you are having a hard time. Are you hungry?"""
"The Great Horned Owl said that he was, so the Screech Owl went hunting and brought him food. ""I will look in every night,"" he said, ""and bring you a lunch. I'm afraid something has happened to your wife and that she will not be back."""
"As he flew away he called out, ""It is too bad. I am very sorry for you. But then, I suppose you would never have the Owlets if you didn't stick to the nest."""
"This last remark made the Great Horned Owl quite angry. ""Much he knows about it,"" he said. ""I guess if he had ever tried it he would be a little more sorry for me."" And then he began to think, ""Who have I heard say those very words before? Who? Who? Who?"""
"All at once the Great Horned Owl remembered how many times he had said just that to his patient wife, and he began to feel very uncomfortable."
"His ears tingled and he felt a queer hot feeling under his face feathers. Perhaps he hadn't been acting very well after all! He knew that even when he told her he was sorry, he had been thinking she made a great fuss. Well, if she would only come back now, that should all be changed, and he shifted his weight and wriggled around into a more comfortable position."
"Now, if this were just a story, one could say that Mrs. Owl came back and that they were all happy together; but the truth is she never did come, and nobody ever knew what became of her. So her husband, the night king of the forest, had to keep the eggs warm and rear his own Owlets."
"You can imagine how glad he was on the night when he first heard them tapping on the inside of their shells, for then he knew that he would soon be free to hunt."
"A finer pair of children were never hatched, and their father thought them far ahead of all his other broods. ""If only Mrs. Owl were here to see them, how lovely it would be!"" he said. Yet if she had been there he would never have had the pleasure of hearing their first faint cheeps, and of covering them with his soft breast feathers as he did each day. He forgot now all the weary time when he sat with aching legs, wishing that his cousin would happen along with something to eat. For that is always the way, when we work for those we love, the weariness is soon forgotten and only happiness remains."
"It is said that the Screech Owl was more thoughtful of his wife after his cousin had to hatch the eggs, and it is too bad that some of the other forest people could not have learned the same lesson; but the Great Horned Owl never told, and the Screech Owl kept his secret, and to this day there are many people in the forest who know nothing whatever about it."
THE SWAGGERING CROW
"When the Crows who have been away for the winter return to the forest, all their relatives gather on the tree-tops to welcome them and tell the news. Those who have been away have also much to say, and it sometimes seems as though they were all talking at once. They spend many days in visiting before they begin nest-building. Perhaps if they would take turns and not interrupt each other, they would get the news more quickly, for when people are interrupted they can never talk well."
"Sometimes, too, one hungry fellow will fly off for a few mouthfuls of grain, and get back just in time to hear the end of a story. Then he will want to hear the first part of it, and make such a fuss that they have to tell it all over again just for him."
"At this time in the spring, you can hear their chatter and laughter, even when you are far away; and the song-birds of the forest look at each other and say, ""Dear me! The Crows are back."" They have very good reasons for disliking the Crows, as any Robin will tell you."
"There was one great shining black Crow who had the loudest voice of all, and who was not at all afraid to use it. This spring he looked very lean and lank, for it had been a long, cold winter, and he had found but little to eat, acorns, the seeds of the wild plants, and once in a great while a frozen apple that hung from its branch in some lonely orchard."
"He said that he felt as though he could reach around his body with one claw, and when a Crow says that he feels exceedingly thin. But now spring was here, and his sisters and his cousins and his aunts, yes, and his brothers and his uncles, too, had returned to the forest to live. He had found two good dinners already, all that he could eat and more too, and he began to feel happy and bold. The purple gloss on his feathers grew brighter every day, and he was glad to see this. He wanted to look so handsome that a certain Miss Crow, a sister of one of his friends, would like him better than she did any of the others."
"That was all very well, if he had been at all polite about it. But one day he saw her visiting with another Crow, and he lost his temper, and flew at him, and pecked him about the head and shoulders, and tore the long fourth feather from one of his wings, besides rumpling the rest of his coat. Then he went away. He had beaten him by coming upon him from behind, like the sneak that he was, and he was afraid that if he waited he might yet get the drubbing he deserved. So he flew off to the top of a hemlock-tree where the other Crows were, and told them how he had fought and beaten. You should have seen him swagger around when he told it. Each time it was a bigger story, until at last he made them think that the other Crow hadn't a tail feather left."
"The next day, a number of Crows went to a farm not far from the forest."
Miss Crow was in the party. On their way they stopped in a field where there stood a figure of a man with a dreadful stick in his hand.
"Everybody was frightened except Mr. Crow. He wanted to show how much courage he had, so he flew right up to it. They all thought him very brave. They didn't know that down in his heart he was a great coward. He wasn't afraid of this figure because he knew all about it. He had seen it put up the day before, and he knew that there was no man under the big straw hat and the flapping coat. He knew that, instead of a thinking, breathing person, there was only a stick nailed to a pole. He knew that, instead of having two good legs with which to run, this figure had only the end of a pole stuck into the ground."
"Of course, he might have told them all, and then they could have gathered corn from the broken ground around, but he didn't want to do that. Instead, he said, ""Do you see that terrible great creature with a stick in his hand? He is here just to drive us away, but he dares not touch me. He knows I would beat him if he did."" Then he flew down, and ate corn close beside the figure, while the other Crows stood back and cawed with wonder."
"When he went back to them, he said to Miss Crow, ""You see how brave I am. If I were taking care of anybody, nothing could ever harm her."" And he looked tenderly at her with his little round eyes. But she pretended not to understand what he meant, for she did not wish to give up her pleasant life with the flock and begin nest-building just yet."
"When they reached the barn-yard, there was rich picking, and Mr. Crow made such a clatter that you would have thought he owned it all and that the others were only his guests. He flew down on the fence beside a couple of harmless Hens, and he flapped his wings and swaggered around until they began to sidle away. Then he grew bolder (you know bullies always do if they find that people are scared), and edged up to them until they fluttered off, squawking with alarm."
"Next he walked into the Hen-house, saying to the other Crows, ""You might have a good time, too, if you were not such cowards."" He had no more than gotten the words out of his bill, when the door of the Hen-house blew shut and caught there. It was a grated door and he scrambled wildly to get through the openings. While he was trying, he heard the hoarse voice of the Crow whom he had beaten the day before, saying, ""Thank you, we are having a fairly good time as it is""; and he saw Miss Crow picking daintily at some corn which the speaker had scratched up for her."
"""Perhaps,"" was the answer. ""But until you do feel it you can never understand it, for it is not like any other feeling that there is."""
"Then they all started for a low clump of bushes to find shelter from the storm. Once they were frightened by seeing a great creature come tramping through the woods towards them. ""A man!"" said Mr. Grouse."
"""Hide!"" said Mrs. Grouse, and each little Grouse hid under the leaves so quickly that nobody could see how it was done. One might almost think that a strong wind had blown them away. The mother pretended that she had a broken wing, and hopped away, making such pitiful sounds that the man followed to pick her up. When she had led him far from her children, she, too, made a quick run and hid herself; and although the man hunted everywhere, he could not find a single bird."
"You know that is always the way in Grouse families, and even if the man's foot had stirred the leaves under which a little one was hiding, the Grouse would not have moved or made a sound. The children are brought up to mind without asking any questions. When their mother says, ""Hide!"" they do it, and never once ask ""Why?"" or answer, ""As soon as I have swallowed this berry."" It is no wonder that the older ones are proud of their children. Any mother would be made happy by having one child obey like that, and think of having twelve!"
"At last, the whole family reached the bushes where they were to stay, and then they began to feed near by. ""Eat all you can,"" said Mr. Grouse, ""before the snow gets deep. You may not have another such good chance for many days."" So they ate until their little stomachs would not hold one more seed or evergreen bud."
"All this time the snowflakes were falling, but the Grouse children were no longer afraid of them. Sometimes they even chased and snapped at them as they would at a fly in summer-time. It was then, too, that they learned to use snow-shoes. The oldest child had made a great fuss when he found a fringe of hard points growing around his toes in the fall, and had run peeping to his mother to ask her what was the matter. She had shown him her own feet, and had told him how all the Ruffed Grouse have snow-shoes of that kind grow on their feet every winter."
"""We do not have to bother about them at all,"" she said. ""They put themselves on when the weather gets cold in the fall, and they take themselves off when spring comes. We each have a new pair every year, and when they are grown we can walk easily over the soft snow. Without them we should sink through and flounder."""
"When night came they all huddled under the bushes, lying close together to keep each other warm. The next day they burrowed into a snow-drift and made a snug place there which was even better than the one they left; the soft white coverlet kept the wind out so well. It was hard for the little ones to keep quiet long, and to amuse them Mr. Grouse told how he first met their mother in the spring."
"""It was a fine, sunshiny day,"" he said, ""and everybody was happy. I had for some time been learning to drum, and now I felt that I was as good a drummer as there was in the forest. So I found a log (every Ruffed Grouse has to have his own place, you know) and I jumped up on it and strutted back and forth with my head high in the air. It was a dusky part of the forest and I could not see far, yet I knew that a beautiful young Grouse was somewhere near, and I hoped that if I drummed very well she might come to me."""
"""I know!"" interrupted one of the little Grouse. ""It was our mother."""
"""Well, it wasn't your mother then, my chick,"" said Mr. Grouse, ""for that was long, long before you were hatched."""
"""She was our mother afterwards, anyway,"" cried the young Grouse. ""I just know she was!"""
"Mr. Grouse's eyes twinkled, but he went gravely on. ""At last I flapped my wing's hard and fast, and the soft drumming sound could be heard far and near. 'Thump-thump-thump-thump-thump; thump-thump-rup-rup-rup-rup-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r.' I waited, but nobody came. Then I drummed again, and after that I was sure that I heard a rustling in the leaves. I drummed a third time, and then, children, there came the beautiful young Grouse, breaking her way through the thicket and trying to look as though she didn't know that I was there."""
"""Did she know?"" cried the little Grouse."
"""You must ask your mother that,"" he answered, ""for it was she who came."
"Ah, what happy days we had together all spring! We wandered all through this great Forest and even made some journeys into the edge of the Meadow. Still, there was no place we loved as we did the dusky hollow by the old log where we first met. One day your mother told me that she must begin housekeeping and that I must keep out of the way while she was busy. So I had to go off with a crowd of other Ruffed Grouse while she fixed her nest, laid her eggs, and hatched out you youngsters. It was rather hard to be driven off in that way, but you know it is the custom among Grouse. We poor fellows had to amuse ourselves and each other until our wives called us home to help take care of the children."
"We've been at that work ever since."""
"""Oh!"" said one of the young Grouse. ""Oh, I am so glad that you drummed, and that she came when she heard you. Who would we have had to take care of us if it hadn't happened just so?"""
"That made them all feel very solemn and Mr. Grouse couldn't answer, and Mrs. Grouse couldn't answer, and none of the little Grouse could answer because, you see, it is one of the questions that hasn't any answer."
"Still, they were all there and happy, so they didn't bother their crested heads about it very long."
A MILD DAY IN WINTER
"It had been a cold and windy winter. Day after day the storm-clouds had piled up in the northwest and spread slowly over the sky, dropping great ragged flakes of snow down to the shivering earth. Then the forest trees were clothed in fleecy white garments, and the branches of the evergreens drooped under their heavy cloak."
"Then there had been other days, when a strong wind stripped the trees of their covering, and brought with it thousands of small, hard flakes."
"These flakes were drier than the ragged ones had been, and did not cling so lovingly to everything they touched. They would rather frolic on the ground, rising again and again from their resting-places to dance around with the wind, and help make great drifts and overhanging ledges of snow in the edge of the Forest, where there was more open ground."
"It is true that not all the winter had been cold and stormy. There were times when the drifts melted slowly into the earth, and the grass, which last summer had been so tender and green, showed brown and matted on the ground. Still the Great Horned Owl and his wife could not find enough to eat. ""We do not mean to complain,"" said he with dignity, as he scratched one ear with his feathered right foot, ""but neither of us has had a meal hearty enough for a healthy Robin, since the first heavy snow came."""
"This was when he was talking to his cousin, the Screech Owl. ""Hearty enough for a Robin!"" exclaimed Mrs. Great Horned Owl. ""I should say we hadn't. I don't think I have had enough for a Goldfinch, and that is pretty hard for a bird of my size. I am so thin that my feathers feel loose."""
"""Have you been so hungry that you dreamed about food?"" asked the Screech Owl."
"""N-no, I can't say that I have,"" said the Great Horned Owl, while his wife shook her head solemnly."
"""Ah, that is dreadful,"" said the Screech Owl. ""I have done that several times. Only yesterday, while I lay in my nest-hollow, I dreamed that I was hunting. There was food everywhere, but just as I flew down to eat, it turned into pieces of ice. When I awakened I was almost starved and so cold that my beak chattered."""
"It was only a few days after the Screech Owl's call upon his cousins that he awakened one night to find the weather milder, and the ground covered with only a thin coating of soft snow. The beautiful round moon was shining down upon him, and in the western sky the clouds were still red from the rays of the setting sun."
"Somewhere, far beyond the fields and forests of this part of the world, day-birds were beginning to stir, and thousands of downy heads were drawn from under sheltering wings, while in the barnyards the Cocks were calling their welcome to the sun. But the Screech Owl did not think of this. He aroused his wife and they went hunting. When they came back they did not dream about food. They had eaten all that they could, and the Great Horned Owl and his wife had made a meal hearty enough for a dozen Robins, and a whole flock of Goldfinches. It was a good thing for the day-birds that this was so, for it is said that sometimes, when food is very scarce, Owls have been known to hunt by daylight."

BASTARD-TITLE
"The bastard-title, which is often wrongly called the half-title,"
"is a modern evolution in its present application. Originally, this"
"heard it, for he stood up and forced a smile upon his long sad face."
Noll went close to him hurriedly:
"“One word, Netherby--quick, before she comes--do you know where Betty"
is?” he asked hoarsely.
Netherby smiled a sad smile:
"“Ah, Noll, that _you_ should have to ask _me_ that!”"
Noll passed Julia at the stair-head and left them together.
"As he stepped across the hall he hesitated, turned, and went into the"
"old lady’s room. She was sitting in the window, looking out; and she"
turned at his footfall.
Noll bent down and kissed the old face; and he saw that the harsh light
had gone out of her eyes:
“Won’t you be a little lonely here to-night?” Noll asked her.
"“No,” she said--“she has taken seats for all three of us.”"

There was a little pause. Then she put both her hands on his and pressed

CHAPTER LXXXV
_Wherein a Man of the World commits the Indiscretion of putting his
Experiences into Writing_
"“Dear Noll,” writes Horace Malahide about this time, “I have a son."
He speaks English as yet with a strong foreign accent--but lack of
"experience may have more than something to do with it. If you come,"
I’ll let you play with him.
I live in a whirl of tangled emotions in these days.
"T’other evening I went home, to my father’s marble halls, to seek"
the old gentleman on an affair of hot urgency. It was in the long
hours. I lost some temper--the butler being a sphinx of ducal
"know-nothingness--so I rang up the housekeeper. Yes, she knew where a"
telegram would find Sir Pompey if I would leave it with her.
I!
Leave it!
"Gods! said I, am I utterly disinherit?"
Forthwith the heir of this branch of the Malahides demanded the address.
It lay at St. John’s Wood!
"“Oh, I have been worried to death!” murmured Teddy in her other ear."
“That wretched doctor had not only moved but gone out of town; and when
I came back at last and found—”
"“Mr. Severance,” exclaimed Trent, “you have my chair.”"
“Is this your chair? You have good taste. A remarkably comfortable
chair.”
“You would oblige me—”
"“By keeping it? Certainly. You were ever generous, but that I believe is"
a characteristic of genius.”
"“Mrs. Pendleton,” said Boswell, plaintively, “as Mr. Dedham has taken my"
"chair, I will take this stool at your feet.”"
"Trent was obliged to lean his elbow on the mantelpiece, for want of a"
"better view of Mrs. Pendleton, and Miss Decker sat on the other side of"
Dedham.
"“How are you, Teddy?” she said."
“Young and happy. You must let me congratulate you.”
“For what?”
"“I see you wear Severance’s ring. Ah, Sev, did the ring suit your"
sister?”
“To a T. Said it was her favourite stone.” He stopped abruptly. “What
the deuce—” below his breath; and Jessica whispered hurriedly:—
"""Why, I saw him with Mr. Puttock."""
"""Yes; but Mr. Puttock knows nothing of him, except that he said he came"
from Shepherdstown. That's why Puttock was civil to him. The place is in
"his constituency."""
"""Got any idea, sir?"" the subordinate ventured to ask."
"The Superintendent was about to answer in the negative, when a detective"
entered the room.
"""Well, I've found one missing man for you,"" he said, in a satisfied"
tone.
"""One missing man!"" echoed his superior, scornfully. ""In a place o' this"
"size I'd always find you twenty."""
"The sergeant went on, unperturbed,"

The waiter came bringing Cæsar’s breakfast. “Will you tell me what it
"is?” said Cæsar to the ecclesiastic, while he filled his cup."
"The monk waited until the waiter was gone, and then said in a hard"
voice:
“His Eminence the Cardinal sent me to bid you not to present yourself
"anywhere again, giving his name.”"
"“What? What does this mean?” asked Cæsar, calmly."
“It means that His Eminence has found out about your intrigues and
machinations.”
“Intrigues? What intrigues were those?”
“You know perfectly well. And His Eminence forbids you to continue in
that direction.”
“His Eminence forbids me to pay calls? And for what reason?”
“Because you have used his name to introduce yourself into certain
places.”
“It is not true.”
“You have told people you went to that you are Cardinal Fort’s nephew.”
"“And I am not?” asked Cæsar, after taking a swallow of coffee."
"“You are trying to make use of the relationship, we don’t know with what"
end in view.”
"The old man became all the more frightened, and glanced at his face."
"""You are lying!"" he said scornfully, when the teacher had finished."
"""What lie have I told?"" asked the teacher."
"""You mentioned tribes that are not mentioned in the Bible."""
"He got up and walked away, angry and deeply insulted."
"""You will go mad, Tyapa,"" called the teacher after him with conviction."
"Then the old man came back again, and stretching out his hand,"
threatened him with his crooked and dirty finger.
"""God made Adam--from Adam were descended the Jews, that means that all"

"""Well?"""
"""Tartars are descended from Ishmael, but he also came of the Jews ..."""

"""Nothing!  Only why do you tell lies?""  Then he walked away, leaving"
his companion in perplexity.  But after two days he came again and sat
by him.
"""You are learned ...  Tell me, then, whose descendants are we? Are we"
"Babylonians, or who are we?"""
"""We are Slavs, Tyapa,"" said the teacher, and attentively awaited his"
"“Cheer up, Andrew,” he cried."
Blotte smiled wearily; he roused from his brooding; he was very pale:
“Where’s the bar?” he asked gloomily.
Rippley laughed:
"“Vanity Fair has not opened her drinking-saloons yet,” he said. “We’re"
all before our welcome.”
"Blotte sighed, and said absently:"
“I have come to tell Pangbutt I cannot sup with him to-night.” He
"smiled a pale sad smile; and, rousing, added moodily: “I came into my"
Irish estates last night--took over the keys of my castle in Spain....
"Last night I slept under the blue quilt, and filled my belly with the"
"north wind. And,” he added hoarsely, “to-night I sup with the gods.”"
"Rippley shook the moody man by the shoulders, and gripping them in his"
"big kind hands, he said:"
"“Shut up, Blotte; you’ve got to sup with _us_ to-night--gods are a"
"large order, even Aubrey is not yet translated.”"
Blotte roused; laughed; strode into the middle of the great room. He
turned gloomily:
"“No--I go to a mighty banquet, old friend. I go to sup with the gods"
to-night.”

"ROBERTS, CAPTAIN BARTHOLOMEW. Welsh pirate."
Born 1682. Died 1722.
If a pirate is to be reckoned by the amount of damage he does and the
number of ships he takes there can be no doubt that Captain Roberts should
"be placed at the very head of his profession, for he is said to have taken"
over 400 vessels. The only man who can be said to rival him is Sir Henry
"Morgan, but Morgan, although in some ways an unmitigated blackguard, was a"
"man of much greater breadth of outlook than Roberts ever was, and,"
"moreover, was a buccaneer rather than a pirate."
"Roberts, like many other successful pirates, was born in Wales, not far"
"from Haverfordwest. He is described as being ""a tall black man,"" and was"
"""What have you got?"" she asked."
"""One pair,--aces. What have you?"""

"""Even now,--we're even."""
"""It's the next hand that tells, Jack, ain't it?"""
"""Yes."""
"""It's the next hand that tells me,--I'm awfully sorry,--"" the words"
"seemed to come awkwardly; her glance was troubled, almost contrite, ""at"
"any rate, I want to say jest now that no matter how it comes out--"""
"""Cut!"" interjected Rance mechanically."
"""--that I'll always think of you the best I can,"" completed the Girl"
"with much feeling. ""An' I want you to do the same for me."""
"Silently, inscrutably, the gambler dealt the ten cards, one by one. But"
"as the Girl started to draw hers toward her, his long, thin fingers"
reached across once more and closed not ungently upon hand and cards.
"""The last hand, Girl!"" he reminded her. ""And I've a feeling that I"
"win,--that in one minute I'll hold you in my arms."" And still covering"
"her fingers with his own, he stole a glance at his cards."
"Chicago or Boston some traveller will find an abandoned chapel, and will"
ask: ‘What is this? ‘And they will tell him: ‘This is what remains of
the Catholic Church.’”
"“Don’t talk like an Homais,” said Kennedy."
"“I don’t know who Homais is,” retorted Cæsar."
"“An atheistical druggist in Flaubert’s novel, _Madame Bovary_. Haven’t"
you read it?”
"“Yes; I have a vague idea that I have read it. A very heavy thing; yes,"
... I think I have read it.”
"The woman opened the door and they went into the church. It was small,"
overcharged with ornaments. They saw the tomb of Bishop Spinelli and
"Giotto’s Virgin, and then went into a hall gay with red flags with a"
"white cross, on whose walls they could read the names of the Grand"
Masters of the Order of Malta. The majority of the names were French and
"Polish. Two or three were Spanish, and among them that of Cæsar Borgia."
"“Your countryman and namesake was also a Grand Master of Malta,” said"
Kennedy.
"“So it seems,” replied Cæsar with indifference. “I see that you speak"
with contempt of that extraordinary man. Is he not congenial to you?”
“The fact is I don’t know his history.”
“Really?”
"“Yes, really.”"
"She smiled, rather superciliously I thought."
"""But how did the terrible affair occur?"""
"""We have no idea,"" answered the Countess brokenly.  ""She was found lying"
upon the floor of the salon within a quarter of an hour of the departure
"of her visitor, who proved to be yourself.  Jean, the valet-de-chambre,"
"on entering, discovered her lying there, quite dead."""
"""Astounding!""  I gasped.  ""She was in perfect health when I left her."""
"She shook her head sorrowfully, and her voice, choking with grief,"
declared:
"""My child has been killed--murdered!"""
"""Murdered!  Impossible!""  I cried."
"""But she has,"" she declared.  ""I am absolutely positive of it!"""
CHAPTER SIX.
A PIECE OF PLAIN PAPER.
"""What medical examination has been made?""  I demanded."
"""None,"" responded the Countess.  ""My poor child is dead, and no doctor"
"can render her assistance.  Medical aid is unavailing."""
"""But do you mean to say that on making this discovery you did not think"
"it necessary to send for a doctor?""  I cried incredulously."
"“You are as cruel as ever,” said Boswell, with a sigh. “Where is my"
ring?” he whispered.
“It was so large that I could not keep it on. I must have a guard made.”
“Dear little fingers—”
"“You may never have been taught when you were a small boy, Mr. Boswell,”"
"interrupted Trent, “that it is rude to whisper in company. Therefore, to"
"save your manners in Mrs. Pendleton’s eyes, I will do you the kindness"
to prevent further lapse.” And he seated himself on the other side of
Jessica and glared defiantly at Boswell.
“Mr. Severance and Mr. Dedham!”
"Severance entered hurriedly. “I am so glad to hear—ah, Boswell! Trent!”"
“How odd that you should all find your way here the very first evening
of your arrival!” And Jessica held out her hand with a placid smile.
"Miss Decker was more nervous, but five seasons were behind her. “Ah!”"
"continued Mrs. Pendleton, “and Mr. Dedham, too! This is a most charming"
reunion!”
“Charming beyond expression!” said Severance.
Trent and Boswell being obliged to rise when Miss Decker went forward to
"meet the newcomers, Severance took the former’s chair, Dedham that of"
the future statesman.
“You are better?” whispered Severance. “I have been anxious.”
"They shoved their one ""Dutchman"" forward, and after some interchange"
"of utter un-intelligibilities, listened to by every one with bated"

"""I not versteh, captain.  I denk him ein French."""
"The Frenchman was joined by two or three more, and then by a dozen."
"""Why, they're all French,"" said the disgusted crowd.  ""What's"
"Frenchmen doin' on any island of ours?"""
"And until the sea went down, which it did sufficiently to allow them"
"to get ashore at about ten o'clock, they discussed the question as to"
whether the Crozets were English or not.  It was settled by old
Mackenzie.
"""All islands as don't belong to any one belongs to us,"" he said; ""it"
"was arranged so by Disraeli."""
"They got ashore with some risk, and were greeted by the Frenchman in"
the most amiable way.
"""Poor beggars!"" said the crew; ""it must be 'ard on a soft lot of"
things like them to be on a des'late hisland.  Ain't it a wonder
"Froggies ever goes to sea?  But does they belong 'ere, or was they"
"piled hup same's hus?"""
Hart found himself alongside a Frenchman with a long red Liberty cap
"on, and a big pair of ear-rings in his ears."
"""Goddam,"" said the Frenchman."
"""I think this is a herror of judgment, sir,"" said Hart; ""my hidea of"
"a hultimatum was jumpin' on 'em unexpected, and givin' 'em toko afore"
they know'd where they was.  My notion of fightin' (and it pays
"hevery time) is to haggravate your man till he's ready to 'it, but to"
"'it 'im fust.  An' if I thinks a cove will 'it me in five minutes, I"
"lets no time go by in hanticipatin' 'im.  But this will warn 'em."""
"""But they have no one who really knows English, Hart,"" groaned"
"Simcox; ""and I don't know the first word of French."""
"""Never mind, sir,"" said Hart encouragingly.  ""I've 'ad many a row"
"with a Frenchy, and I never knowed my 'avin' not the least notion of"
what 'e meant ever stopped the fight from comin' off.  If so be I see
"you get stuck, I'll come in, sir."""
And they were met by the French sailor who thought he spoke English.
"""I spik En'lish, goddam,"" said the Frenchman.  ""Leaverpool,"
"Por'smout'; mais le capitaine spik besser."""
"""Good-mornin',"" said Simcox meekly to the French captain, a long"
"unhappy looking man, who might have been the skipper of a"
_chasse-marée_ for all the style he put on.
"""Mais, oui----"" said the captain."
"""This 'ere paper is for you,"" said Simcox, ""and by the powers I hope"
"you can't read it."""
"He handed the ultimatum to the Frenchman, who studied it while his"
crew came round.
"""That is true,"" Vaviloff nodded, ""I knew that before."""
"""Well, what then?"" asked the merchant, loudly."
"""Nothing ...  Let us be friends!"""
"""It is nice to see that you have decided so quickly. Look here, I have"
already prepared a notification to the court of the withdrawal of the
"summons against my father. Here it is; read it, and sign it."""
"Vaviloff looked at his companion with his round eyes and shivered, as"
if experiencing an unpleasant sensation.
"""Pardon me ... sign it?  And why?"""
"""There is no difficulty about it ... write your Christian name and"
"surname and nothing more,"" explained Petunikoff, pointing obligingly"
with his finger to the place for the signature.
"""Oh!  It is not that ...  I was alluding to the compensation I was to"
"get for my ground."""
"""But then this ground is of no use to you,"" said Petunikoff, calmly."
"""But it is mine!"" exclaimed the soldier."
"""Of course, and how much do you want for it?"""
"""Well, say the amount stated in the document,"" said Vaviloff, boldly."
"""Six hundred!"" and Petunikoff smiled softly.  ""You are a funny fellow!"""
said he. “Look here”--he slapped the old man’s chest jocosely--“your
master and the amateur aristocracy used to have private theatricals
here. Where are his wigs and make-up things? Where does he keep them?
Quick!”
The old butler promptly began to retire backwards upon a handsome
cabinet:
"“Gentlemen, gentlemen; surely I have no need to remind you that Mr."
"Pangbutt’s wigs are his private property,” said the shocked, anxious"
old man. “I haven’t Mr. Pangbutt’s permission----”
"Rippley followed him up, grimly smiling:"
"“Get out, you old panjandrum!” said he. “You’ve shown the hiding-place,"
you naughty old deceiver. Go away!”
"He pushed the expostulating old man from the cabinet, and, throwing"
"open the drawers, proceeded to ransack them."
“Hullo!” he cried--“splendid!”
He struck a match:
“Spirit lamp--everything. Ginger! Here’s a glorious short beard affair
that goes down the middle of the chin and all along the throat.”
He put it on.
"“By Clarkson, makes me look like a ducal butler--I’ll be butler.”"
"He flung off his coat, and his deft fingers began to fix the disguise"
"for the disapprobation of the Kirton mob, they held that in high scorn."
"""They'd cheer burglary, if Medland did it,"" said one."
"""Well, he wants to, pretty nearly,"" added a capitalist."
"""But the country will take a very different view. Puttock'll rub it into"
"all his people: _they_'ll not vote for him. What do you say, Coxon?"""
"""I think we shall beat him badly,"" said that gentleman, as he rose and"
went out.
"Captain Heseltine soon followed, and was surprised to see Coxon's figure"
just ahead of him as he entered the gates of Government House.
"""Hang the fellow! What does he want here?"" asked the Captain."
"Mr. Coxon asked for Lady Eynesford. When he entered, she rose with a"
newspaper in her hand.
"""What a shocking, shameful thing this is!"" she said. ""What a blessing it"
"is that the Government was beaten!"""
Coxon acquiesced in both these opinions.
"""I never thought well of him,"" continued the lady. ""Now everybody sees"
him in his true colours. And it's you we have chiefly to thank for our
"deliverance."""
"Coxon murmured a modest depreciation of his services, and said,"
"""I hope Miss Derosne is well?"""

"=Alignment= (_c_).--The arrangement of type in straight lines, also"
"the adjustment of the lines of type so that their ends appear in line,"
vertically.
"(_c_) In all other languages, under the name following the prefix, with"
cross-references whenever the name has been commonly used in English
"with the prefix, as _Del Rio_, _Vandyck, Van Ess_: e.g. _Gama, Vasco"
"da_, _Goethe, J. W. von_."
"But when the name is printed as one word, entry is made under the"
"prefix, as _Vanderhaeghen_."
(_d_) Naturalized names with prefixes are to be treated by the rules of
the nation adopting them.
"Thus German names preceded by _von_, when belonging to Russians, are to"
"be entered under _Von_, as this is the Russian custom. So when Dutch"
names compounded with _van_ are adopted into French or English (as _Van
Laun_) the _Van_ is treated as part of the family name.
"Prefixes are _d', de, de La_ (the name goes under _La_ not _de_),"

“And there are superior things which are good for nothing.”
"“Will you come and take a drive with me, philosopher brother?”"
“Where?”
“Let’s go to the Villa Borghese. The carriage will be here in a moment.”
“All right. Let us go there.”
"A two-horse victoria with rubber tires was waiting at the door, and"
"Laura and Cæsar got in. The carriage went past the Treasury, and out"
"the Porta Salaria, and entered the gardens of the Villa Borghese."
The morning had been rainy; the ground was damp; the wind waved the
tree-tops gently and caused a murmur like the tide. The carriage rolled
slowly along the avenues. Laura was very gay and chatty. Cæsar listened
to her as one listens to a bird warbling.
Many times while listening he thought: “What is there inside this head?
"What is the master idea of her life? Has she really any idea about life,"
or has she none?”
After several rounds they crossed the viaduct that unites the Villa
Borghese with the Pincio gardens.
_FROM THE PINCIO TERRACE_
They approached the great terrace of the gardens by an avenue that has
busts of celebrated men along both sides.

THE POWER OF EVIL
"""You might call it a fight,"" Elizabeth said, ""but they never actually"
"laid a hand on each other."""
"Dr. Carew stared at her in puzzlement as she went on. ""They threw every"
"hard thing in the room at each other, without ever touching anything. It"
"was like some ghastly, murderous game. A clock flew through the air like"
"a cannonball, straight at Joseph's head, and some unseen force seemed to"
stop it. For a second it hung there and trembled in the air--_with
nothing under it_; then it turned and flew like lightning at Quincy; he
barely dodged it.
"""Finally a vase did find its mark and Quincy fell to the floor. Joseph"
"stepped over him and came toward me. I ran, slamming the door in his"
"face, locking him in. He laughed evilly and called after me, 'Why waste"
"time running away, Elizabeth? I'll come to get you, and you won't be"
"able to resist me now!'"""

"scrub of his little bristly beard, and raised her face with a deep sigh"
of satisfaction. A voice behind them said mockingly:
"""Bravo!"""
"There, by the door, stood Fiorsen."
"""Congratulations, madame!  I have long wanted to see you under the"
"inspiration of your--master!"""
Gyp's heart began to beat desperately.  Monsieur Harmost had not moved.
"A faint grin slowly settled in his beard, but his eyes were startled."
Fiorsen kissed the back of his own hand.
"""To this old Pantaloon you come to give your heart.  Ho--what a lover!"""
Gyp saw the old man quiver; she sprang up and cried:
"""You brute!"""
"Fiorsen ran forward, stretching out his arms toward Monsieur Harmost, as"
if to take him by the throat.
"The old man drew himself up.  ""Monsieur,"" he said, ""you are certainly"

"He bowed her out of the room, and then, snatching up his hat and cane"
"with very visible annoyance, included the others in a curt nod of"

He passed her before she had closed her own door--and would gladly have
paused there.
"""You won't forget me, will you?"" she heard him ask eagerly from behind"
her. But she did not delay to answer that question.
"A few minutes later, Slyne knocked at her door and entered, followed by"
the other two men. He had brought with him the papers which Mr. Jobling
"had prepared. Mr. Jobling carried an inkstand, and Captain Dove a"
decanter of brandy. Slyne seated himself at the table and waved Sallie
back to her chair by the window.
"""We're going to talk business for a few minutes,"" he told her, ""and then"
get everything settled in writing--to keep you safe.
"""Fire ahead now, Dove. You want to know--"""
"""Is Sallie really--"""
"""_I_ don't know anyone of that name now. D'you mean Lady Josceline?"""
"Captain Dove glared at him, and then at the lawyer, and then at Sallie"
herself.
"""Is that really who I am now, Jasper?"" she asked, a most wistful"
inflection in her low voice.
"""Why do you stop? Why don't you go on--finish your search--only don't"
"ever speak to me again."""
"At that, Rance became conciliatory."
"""Say, Min, I don't want to quarrel with you."""
Turning her back on him the Girl moved over to the bureau where she
snapped out over her shoulder:
"""Go on with your search, then p'r'aps you'll leave a lady to herself to"
"go to bed."""
The Sheriff followed her up with the declaration:
"""I'm plumb crazy about you, Min."""
The Girl shrugged her shoulder.
"""I could have sworn I saw--I--Oh, you know it's just you for me--just"
"you, and curse the man you like better. I--I--even yet I can't get over"
"the queer look in your face when I told you who that man really was."" He"
"stopped and flung his overcoat down on the floor, and fixing her with a"
"look he demanded: ""You don't love him, do you?"""
Again the Girl sent over her shoulder a forced little laugh.
"""Who--me?"""
"The Sheriff's face brightened. Taking a few steps nearer to her, he"
hazarded:
"""Sibyl told me that he had a long chat with her, and she described him"
"as a most charming fellow."""
"""Ah, no doubt!  I suspected him and watched.  It was evident that he"
"came to my salon in order to meet her."""
"""To meet Sibyl!  Why?"""
"""That I cannot tell."""
"""But I think, Baronne, we may be both agreed upon one point."""
"""And that is?"""
"""That the man who now calls himself Rodolphe Wolf is here in Paris with"
"some secret motive."""
"""I am entirely in accord, m'sieur--quite.  Some steps must at once be"
"taken to ascertain that man's motives."""
"""It seems curious that he should have been introduced for the purpose of"
"meeting Sibyl.  What information did he want from her?"""
"""How can we tell?  You know better than myself whether she ever knows"
"any secrets of the Embassy."""
"""She knows nothing,--of that I am absolutely convinced,"" I responded."
"""Her father is devoted to her; but, nevertheless, he is one of those"

"gay, bright life in London and of the beautiful Belinda Molyneux, an"
"imaginary Egeria, who sometimes lunched with the queen. The effort of"
"artistic creation absorbed him, as it always had done, under the spell"
of Stellamaris's shining eyes. The foolish world of his imagination
"became real, and for the moment hung like a veil before his actual world"

entered and asked him if he could speak to Mr. Herold outside the door..
"“Tell him to come in,” said Stellamaris."
"“He says he will, Miss, after he has seen Mr. Risca.”"
Risca found Herold on the landing.
“Well?”
“Well?” said John.
“What has happened? How did she take it?”
"John looked away, and thrust his hands into his pockets."
“I 've not told her yet.”
Walter drew a breath. “But you 're going to?”

"Serious as was Johnson's predicament, he could not suppress a smile. In"
a surprisedly calm voice he told her to say that she had gone to bed.
The Girl's eyes flooded with admiration.
"""Why, o' course--that's it,"" she said, and turned back to the door and"
"called through it: ""I've gone to bed, Nick! I'm in bed now!"""
The barkeeper's answer was lost in another loud howl of the blast. Soon
"afterwards, however, the Girl made out that Nick was endeavouring to"
convey to her a warning of some kind.
"""You say you've come to warn me?"" she cried."
"""Yes, Ramerrez . . .!"""
"""What? Say that again?"""
"""Ramerrez is on the trail--"""
"""Ramerrez's on the trail!"" repeated the Girl in tones of alarm; and not"
waiting to hear further she motioned to Johnson to conceal himself
"behind the curtains of the bed, muttering the while:"
"""I got to let 'em in--I can't keep 'em out there on such a night . . ."""
He had barely reached his place of concealment when the Girl slid back
the bolts and bade the boys to come in.
"Headed by Rance, the men quickly filed in and deposited their lanterns"
"on the floor. It was evident that they had found the storm most severe,"
"upon tier, against the gorgeous evening sky."

IN WHICH A MUTINY IS THREATENED
"Even after they were miles down the Sound, Boyd remained at his post,"
sweeping the waters astern in an anxious search for some swift harbor
"craft, the appearance of which would signal that his escape had been"
discovered.
"""I won't feel safe until we are past Port Townsend,"" he confessed to"
"Cherry, who maintained a position at his side."
"""Why Port Townsend? We don't stop there."""
"""No. But the police can wire on from Seattle to stop us and take me off"
"at that point."""
"""If they find out their mistake."""
"""They must have found it out long ago. That's why I've got Peasley"
"forcing this old tub; she's doing ten knots, and that's a breakneck"
"speed for her. Once we're through the Straits, I'll be satisfied. But"
"meanwhile--"" Emerson lowered his glasses with a sigh of fatigue, and in"
the soft twilight the girl saw that his face was lined and careworn.
"The yearning at her heart lent poignant sympathy to her words, as she"
"""We've got his horse,"" he said pointedly."
"""An' I never knowed one o' these men to separate from his horse,"""
"commented Sonora, still smarting under the Girl's reprimand."
"""Right you are! And now that we've got his horse and this storm is on,"
"we've got him,"" said Rance, triumphantly. ""But the last seen of"
"Johnson,"" he went on with a hasty movement towards the Girl and eyeing"
"her critically, ""he was heading this way. You seen anything of him?"""
The Girl struggled hard to appear composed.
"""Heading this way?"" she inquired, reddening."
"""So Nick said,"" declared Sonora, looking towards that individual for"
proof of his words.
But Nick had caught the Girl's lightning glance imposing silence upon
him; in some embarrassment he stammered out:
"""That is, he was--Sid said he saw 'im take the trail, too."""
"""But the trail ends here,"" pointed out Rance, at the same time looking"
"hard at the Girl. ""And if she hasn't seen him, where was he going?"""
At this juncture Nick espied a cigar butt on the floor; unseen by the
"others, he hurriedly picked it up and threw it in the fire."
"""One o' our dollar Havanas! Good Lord, he's here!"" he muttered to"
himself.
"""Rance is right. Where was he goin'?"" was the question with which he was"
every hut and tent was brilliantly illuminated. Multitudes of dazzling
stars appeared and disappeared.
We drew our breakfast and packed up our belongings. All was confusion in
the hut.
"We paraded, the roll was called, and as the day began to dawn we marched"
off.
"We passed down the main road in long, swaying columns of fours. We left"
the woodyard behind us and hoped it would be destroyed--how we hated the
place for the dreary months we had spent there! The westward stream of
"refugees had ceased, but an eastward stream of French infantry and field"
artillery thronged the roads. The artillerymen were mostly tall and
powerfully built. The infantry were nearly all elderly men of poor
physique. They looked desperately miserable. We exchanged greetings:
"""It's a good war!"""
"""C'est une bonne guerre!"""
And then we broke into song:
"""Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, _Oh_ it's a lovely war!"""
"The French did not sing, but we, who were escaping destruction, passed"
from one song to another:
"""I don't want to fight the Germans,"
"I don't want to go to war,"
"I'd sooner be in London,"
"Dear old dirty London."""

"“All we know about it is that they’re not here,” replied Jimmie."
"“There are altogether too many bears in this forest,” suggested Gilroy."
“The lads may have encountered some of them.”
“That’s a fact!” laughed Jimmie. “Perhaps we’d better go out and see if
we can find a group of pine trees bearing a mess of Boy Scouts.”
"“This is a serious matter,” Ned interrupted. “Judging from our own"
"experiences, the boys may be having a bad time of it.”"
“The outlaws are none too good to commit murder!” Jimmie asserted.
CHAPTER XI
THE DEVIL’S PUNCH BOWL
"“See here, boys,” Frank Shaw suggested, as the three boys moved on"
"through the forest, almost entirely surrounded by repulsive half-breeds,"
"“this will be a fine story for Dad’s newspaper. ‘Captured by Bold, Bad"
"Men; or, Why Little Frankie Didn’t Get Home to His Beans’! That would be"
"a fine title for the story, and I’ll ask Dad to print a picture of three"
boys wandering through a jungle surrounded by a bunch of cheap skates
that no decent dog would bark at.”
“Keep still!” whispered Harry. “What’s the use of stirring these people
up? We’re in no shape to scrap with them!”

"“Spain is the place for all that,” said Kennedy. “Here in Italy the"
"Church ceremonies are too gay. Not so in Spain; at Toledo, at Burgos,"
"there is an austerity in the cathedrals, an unworldliness....”"
"“Yes,” said Cæsar; “unhappily we have nothing left there but"
"ceremonies. At the same time, the people are dying of hunger.”"
"They discussed whether it is better to live in a decorative, esthetic"
"sphere, or in a more humble and practical one; and Susanna and Kennedy"
stood up for the superiority of an esthetic life.
As they left the hotel Cæsar said to Kennedy:
“Allow me a question. Have you any intentions concerning Mrs.
Marchmont?”
“Why do you ask?”
"“Simply because I shouldn’t go to see her often, so as not to be in the"
way.”
“Thank you ever so much. But I have no intentions in relation to her.
She is too beautiful and too rich a woman for a modest employee like me
to fix his eyes on.”
“Bah! A modest diplomat! That is absurd. It is merely that you don’t
take to her.”
“No. It’s because she is a queen. There ought to be some defect in her
face to make her human.”
"""They was here first,"" said Lampert obstinately."
"""But the hisland is British ground,"" urged Simcox, ""and where our"

"'em if we're to give in now?"""
"""Continuosity of foreign politics is my motter,"" said the skipper."
"""With continuosity and joodishus firmness, and a polite 'hout o'"
"this,' you'll see 'em listen to reason, and evacuate.  I shall send"
"hin my hultimatum this very afternoon.  And you, Simcox, shall be"
"hambassador."""
Simcox looked anxious.
"""Well, captain, I was thinking it would be judicious policy to send"
in the Dutchman.  It will remind them that Europe is more or less
"agin them, and to have a Dutchman here will make 'em think twice"
"afore they elects for war."""
The skipper shook his head.
"""No, Simcox, it looks judicious on the surface, but takin' deeper"
"thought it ain't.  It would aggerawate them, and that ain't policy."
"We fights if we must, but don't start it by doin' anythin' unpleasin'"
more'n askin' for our rights.  And in n'gotiashuns it ain't policy to
remind 'em deliberate of the time the Prooshians beat 'em.  And
moreover it's accordin' to no tradition I've heard of to send a
"furriner as hambassador.  No, Simcox, you shall go.  I'll draw up the"
"hultimatum at once."""
But the teacher was crying as if the tears quieted and comforted him.
"From this day they became friends, and the ""creatures that once were"
"men,"" seeing them together, said: ""The teacher is friendly with Tyapa"
...  He wishes his money. Kuvalda must have put this into his head ...
"To look about to see where the old man's fortune is ..."""
Probably they did not believe what they said.  There was one strange

"""No,"" the teacher informs him."

glasses and tray to be on hand when the whistles began their screaming.

a scratch I had received ten months before not disguising a light of
pride that charmed me.
"""I've forgotten it, Mater. Never amounted to anything."""
"""Still, you did leave some blood on French soil,"" Dad spoke up, for this"
conceit appealed to him.
"""Enough to grow an ugly rose, perhaps,"" I admitted."

chuckled.
"""Pretty ones don't grow any more, on cheeks or anywhere else,"" I"
"doggedly replied. ""Materialism's the keynote now--that's why I'm going"
"back to work, at once."""
"""Oh,"" the Mater laughed, ""don't think of your father's stupid office,"
"yet!"""
"""There's nothing left to think of,"" I grumbled."
"""Isn't there?"" he exclaimed. ""What'd you say if Gates has the yacht in"
"commission, and you take a run down to Miami----"""
"""What is your name, Girl--your real name?"""
"""Min--Minnie; my father's name was Smith,"" she told him, her eyes cast"
down under delicately tremulous lids.
"""Oh, Minnie Sm--"""
"""But 'twa'n't his right name,"" quickly corrected the Girl, and"
"unconsciously both rose to their feet. ""His right name was Falconer."""
"""Minnie Falconer--well, that is a pretty name,"" commented Johnson; and"
raising her hand to his lips he pressed them against it.
"""I ain't sure that's what he said it was--I ain't sure o' anythin' only"
"jest you,"" she said coyly, burying her face in his neck."
"""You may well be sure of me since I've loved--"" Johnson's sentence was"
"cut short, a wave of remorse sweeping over him. ""Turn your head away,"
"Girl, and don't listen to me,"" he went on, gently putting her away from"
"him. ""I'm not worthy of you. Don't listen but just say no, no, no, no."""
"The Girl, puzzled, was even more so when Johnson began to pace the"
floor.
"""Oh, I know--I ain't good enough for you !"" she cried with a little"
"tremour in her voice. ""But I'll try hard, hard . . . If you see"
"anythin' better in me, why don't you bring it out, 'cause I've loved you"
"ever since I saw you first, 'cause I knowed that you--that you were the"
"right man."""
"""The right man,"" repeated Johnson, dismally, for his conscience was"
"Ilaria stirred in her sleep. Her mouth quivered, her hair stirred"
"sudden under the heather, like tendrils of gold shivering in the sun."
"Even as the light increased, Francesco knelt and looked down upon her."
"Hope and life, glorious, sudden, seemed to fall out of the east, a"
radiant faith begotten of spirit-power. Banners of gold were streaming
"in the sky. The gloom fled. A vast expectancy hung solemn, breathless,"
upon the red lips of the day.
"A sigh, and the long, silken lashes quivered. The lips moved, the eyes"
opened.
"""Ilaria! Ilaria!"""
"Sudden silence followed, a vast hush as of undreamed hope. The woman's"
eyes were silently searching the man's face. He bent and cowered over
"her as one who weeps. His hands touched her body, yet she did not"
stir.
"""Ilaria! Ilaria!"""
"It was a hoarse, passionate outcry that broke the golden stupor of the"
"dawn. A sudden light leaped lustrous into the woman's eyes, her face"
shone radiant in its etherealized beauty.
"""Francesco!"""
"""Ah! At last!"""
A great shudder passed through her body. Her eyes grew big with fear.

it.”
"“Ah! Boswell, I am sure you are sitting on Mrs. Pendleton’s foot. By the"

“Dead—better.”
"“I wonder you could tear yourself away so soon,” said Trent, viciously."
“You’d better be careful. She might make a new will.”
“Don’t worry. I spent the happiest fifteen minutes of my life with her
this afternoon. She promised me all.” He turned to Severance. “You have
"been breaking hearts on the beach, I suppose.”"

Decker. “I hear you made a stirring speech the other night.”
“I did. It was on the question of Radicalism in the Press _versus_ Civil
Service Reform. Something must be done to revolutionise this hotbed of
"iniquity, American politics. Such principles need courage, but when the"
hour comes the man must not be wanting—”

"Pendleton, did you receive the copy of my new book I sent a fortnight"
"ago? Unlike many of my others, I had no difficulty in disposing of it."

"understood it, therefore they were kind. They even said—”"
"noticed it when I was over."""

"""I dare say that idea may be dormant under it somewhere. My wife says"
"the girls like it."""

"""Bachelors, Perry, are the men who know. Which gathers most knowledge"

"In the afternoon, when these idlers had one and all set out for the"
"Legislative Assembly, some to work, others still to idle, Mr. Kilshaw"
felt interest enough in the fate of his late henchman to drop in at the
"police office on his way to the same destination. He was well known, and"
no one objected to his walking in and making for the door of the
Superintendent's room. An officer to whom he spoke told him that Ned
"Evans was in custody, and that it was rumoured that some startling"
right under the window of his sitting-room. An Indian voice greeted
"him, ""Don' shoot; me killi him."""
"""Who in h---- are you?"" swore Searles, at a present."
"""Don' shoot, me Ahhæta--all same Sharp-Nose--don' shoot--me killi him."""
"""Killi who? Who have you killed? Talk up quick!"""
"""Me killi him. You come--you see."""
By this time the crowd drew in with questions and eager to help. A
"sergeant arrived with a lantern, and the guard laid rude hands on the"
"Crow scout, Sharp-Nose, who was well known. He was standing over the"
"prostrate figure, and continued to reiterate, ""Me killi him."""
"The lantern quickly disclosed the man on the ground to be John Ermine,"
"late scout and fugitive from justice, shot through the heart and dead,"
with his blanket and rifle on the ground beside him. As he looked
"through the window, he had been stalked and killed by the fool whom he"
"would not allow to shake hands with Katherine Searles, and a few moments"
"later, when Sharp-Nose was brought into her presence, between two"
"soldiers, she recognized him when he said, ""Mabeso, now you shake"
"hands."""
"""Yes, I will shake hands with you, Sharp-Nose,"" and half to herself, as"
"she eyed her malevolent friend, she muttered, ""and he kept you to"

The crew looked at each other and shook their heads.  They scuffled
the door yawned open.
Noll turned at the sound of its unlatching.
The mother of Netherby Gomme stood in the dark hollow of the doorway;
and a grim triumph lurked in her eyes.
"Noll saluted her, hat in hand; and she returned his greeting with a"
grave smile of surprise.
"“Is Netherby at home, Mrs. Gomme?” he asked."
"The grim triumph slipped back to her eyes, and came lurking into the"
corners of the old mouth again:
"“He came home from his honeymoon to-day, Noll,” she said--“will you go"
up and see him?”
"Noll walked into the house, and the door was shut behind him with"
a triumphant slam. He followed the grim old lady into the little
"sitting-room, and as he went the memory of the queenly figure of the"
little child Betty as she walked into the dingy room and kissed the
"jealousy out of this old woman’s heart, came back to him like the"
"fragrance of her sweetness, so that for a while he could not speak what"
he would have said.
"“It was only the other day,” she said, “that you were boys together...."
To me it is only yesterday that he was a--little one--in my--arms.”
Her eyes filled with tears. “But it is all gone.... This passing of
youth is as strange as death....” And she added after awhile: “I think
he--was glad--to come back.”
no wish but to spend some pleasant hours with the Torsen type.
He strolled about the garden waiting for her to get ready. Once she was
"visible through the doorway, and he called to her:"
"""Aren't you coming soon? Don't forget we've got to cross the mountain!"""
"""Well, I can't go bareheaded,"" she replied."
He was impatient.
"""No, you've got to put your hat on, and what a lot of time that takes!"
"Ugh!"""
She measured him coldly and said:
"""You're very--familiar."""
If he had paid her back in the same coin there would have been weeping and
"gnashing of teeth and cries of ""Go away! Go alone!"" and an hour's delay,"
"and reconciliation and embraces. But the actor's manner changed at once,"
"and he replied docilely, as his nature was,"
"""Familiar? Well--perhaps. Sorry!"""
"Then he strolled about the garden again, humming occasionally and swinging"
"his stick. I took note of the oddly feminine shape of his knees, and the"
unusual plumpness of his thighs; there was something unnatural about this
"plumpness, as though it did not belong to his sex."
"His shoes were down at the heel, and his collar was open. His raincoat"
"hung regally from his shoulders and flapped in the wind, though it was not"
"Kilshaw's got a gadfly that does instead, and of course, Coxon, I add"
"you to the list."""
"""Much obliged for your testimonial,"" said Coxon sourly."
"""I add any man I'm talking to, to the list,"" continued the Chief"
"Justice. ""I expect him to do the same by me. But, honestly, I add you"
even in your absence. You're not a man who puts party ties above
"everything."""
"Mr. Coxon darted a suspicious glance at the head of his profession, but"
the Chief Justice's air was blandly innocent.
"""My party's my party,"" he remarked, ""just so long as it carries out my"
"principles. I don't say either party does it perfectly."""
"""I dare say not; but of course you're right to act with the one that"
"does most for you."""
Again the Chief Justice had hit on a somewhat ambiguous expression.
"Coxon detected a grin on the face of Captain Heseltine, who was sitting"
"near, but he could not hold Sir John's grave face guilty of the"
Captain's grin.
"""I see,"" remarked the Captain, perhaps in order to cover the retreat of"
"his grin, ""that they've discharged the woman who was arrested last night"
"for the murder."""
"""Really no evidence against her,"" said the Chief Justice. ""But,"
"Heseltine, wasn't this man Benham the fellow Medland had a sort of"
"shindy with at that flower-show?"""
"""Thank you, sir."""
"After Frank Corson left, Superintendent Maynard sorted a memo out of the"
pile on his desk. The memo concerned Frank Corson. Superintendent
Maynard reread it and thought how well things usually worked out. Now it
wouldn't be necessary to have that talk with Corson about sloppy work.
Obviously there had been something on the young intern's mind for weeks
"now. Too bad. But let the Minnesota hospital, wherever it was, worry"
about the trouble and perhaps put Corson on the right track again.

Brent Taber stood in the shelter of a doorway on the Lower East Side of
Manhattan and watched an entrance across the street. He had been there
for over an hour.
Another hour passed and Taber shifted from one aching foot to the other
as a man in a blue suit emerged from the entrance and moved off down the
street.
"When the man had turned a corner, Taber crossed over and looked up at"
the brownstone. It was a perfect place to hide--one of the many rooming
"houses in the city where, if you paid your rent and kept your peace, no"
one cared who you were or where you came from.

Rippley went and touched him on the shoulder:
"“Blotte, old boy; you’re very queer to-night,” he said. “You make me"
feel as blue as a newly-clipped hearse-horse.”
"Blotte roused, and moved towards the door; halted; turned to them all:"
“I say I sup with the gods to-night--and mix the hats--and set the
table in a roar.... I must hasten away.... I hear them call.... God
"bless you, dear boys! we shall meet in sunshine----”"
Rippley stepped to the door:
"“Quick!” said he in a hushed whisper, “make a line, quick there,"
"you Fluffy, Doome, Blotte, to my left here at the door. Here comes"
Pangbutt.... He blows his nose like the old nobility.... Come along.
Blotte--don’t look like a broken-down anarchist in an advanced stage
"of pip. You must affect the smiling, friendly, neapolitan manner,"
expectant of a fee.”
"As Blotte’s pale face took on a deathly smile, Rippley bowed, and there"
stepped into the open doorway the well-groomed figure of their host.
"Pangbutt halted, perplexed."
He gazed in vague consternation at the Vandyke travesty in white silks
before him--turned to the solemn countenances of the four waiters:
"“May I ask what, in the name of Beelzebub, is happening in this house?”"
he asked.
"“DEAR MADELAINE,"
I am called home.
"I leave my rooms and all in them to your care, knowing that they will"
"be in good hands. I leave you also all the money I can spare, to keep"
you in decency and comfort until I return.
"I shall send, early in the day, for the large leather bag which you"
will find labelled and ready by the door.
NOLL.”
And when he had sealed this letter he wrote another:
"“DEAR BABETTE,"
I hear that you arrived in Paris with Horace yesterday. By the time
you get this letter I shall have left my house in the clouds. Last
"night I found Madelaine at _The Golden Sun_. She was without home,"
"without means, except the sweating pay of mean industries on which"
no honest woman can live; she was without a bed. But her blood is
dancing with life--not with a desire to cower in sweating-dens.
"She was drifting. I gave her all these things that I might, last"
night--and she is now asleep here.
"Come to her as soon as you get this, and let her feel that she is not"

Passed like the mournful cry
Of sunward-sailing cranes.'
TEGNER'S _Drapa_.
"All romance has died out of our woods and hills in England, all our"
fairies are dead long ago. Knowledge so far has brought us only death.
Later on it will bring us a new life. It is even now showing us how this
"may be, and is bringing us face to face again with Nature, and teaching"
us to know and understand the life that there is about us. Science is
"telling us again what we knew long ago and forgot, that our life is not"
"apart from the life about us, but of it. Everything is akin to us, and"
"when we are more accustomed to this knowledge, when we have ceased to"
"Perhaps half an hour we waited, still puzzling over the scraps of"
paper. Suddenly I felt a nudge from Kennedy. Antoinette Moulton was
standing in the doorway across the street. Evidently she preferred not
"to ride in her own car, for a moment later she entered a taxicab."
"“Follow that black cab,” said Kennedy to our driver."
"Sure enough, it stopped in front of the Recherche Apartments and Mrs."
Moulton stepped out and almost ran in.
"We waited a moment, then Kennedy followed. The elevator that had taken"
her up had just returned to the ground floor.
"“The same floor again,” remarked Kennedy, jauntily stepping in and"
nodding familiarly to the elevator boy.
"Then he paused suddenly, looked at his watch, fixed his gaze"
"thoughtfully on me an instant, and exclaimed. “By George—no. I can’t go"
"up yet. I clean forgot that engagement at the hotel. One moment, son."
Let us out. We’ll be back again.”
"Considerably mystified, I followed him to the sidewalk."
"“You’re entitled to an explanation,” he laughed catching my bewildered"
look as he opened the cab door. “I didn’t want to go up now while she
"is there, but I wanted to get on good terms with that boy. We’ll wait"
"until she comes down, then go up.”"
“Where?” I asked.
“That’s what I am going through all this elaborate preparation to find
"""I well remember it,"" he went on.  ""I quite recollect how, on one"
"occasion, you came over to London, and while dining together at Jimmy's"
"you told me of your infatuation, and showed me her photograph.  Do you"
"remember the night when you told me of your engagement to her?"""
"""Perfectly."""
"""And as time went on you suddenly dropped her--for what reason I know"
"not.  We are pals, but I have never attempted to pry into your affairs."
"If she really loved you, it must have been a hard blow for her when she"
"heard that you had forsaken her for Edith Austin."""
"""You reproach me,"" I said.  ""But you do not know the whole truth, my"
"dear fellow.  I discovered that Yolande possessed a second lover."""
"He nodded slowly, with pursed lips."
"""And that was the reason of your parting?"""
"""Yes."""
"""The sole reason?"""
"""The sole reason."""
"""And you have no suspicion that she may have committed suicide because"
"of her love for you?  Such things are not uncommon, remember, with girls"
"of a certain temperament."""
"""If she has committed suicide, it is not on my account,"" I responded in"
a hard voice.
"“How long since you left the camp?” Ned asked, after Jimmie had"
introduced the two.
"“Perhaps half an hour ago,” was the answer. “When I went to sleep, the"
"boys were sitting by the fire, but when I woke there was no one in"
sight. I came out to look for them.”
“I understand you came on a mission for Jack Bosworth’s father?” asked
Ned after a pause.
"“Yes,” was the reply, “at the request of my employer I came on this most"
dangerous mission. I shall be glad to see New York again.”
Ned hesitated a moment and then asked:
“Did Mr. Bosworth ever say anything to you about a set of documents he
wished us to bring to light?”
"“He did not,” was the answer."
"“His purpose in sending you, then, was to secure, by means of our help,"
proof connecting a corporation he is fighting with unlawful acts which
have been or may be committed in this section?”
“That is exactly the idea!” answered Gilroy.
"“Come on,” Jimmie shouted, “let’s get back to camp. I begin to feel"
hungry already. Perhaps the boys have returned.”
Before Gilroy would move out of the forest he insisted on pinning up
certain rents in his clothing and combing out his mussed up hair with
"his fingers. There were also numerous scratches on his face, caused by"
"While walking from the Bridge to the Old Swan, I remarked to Frances, ""My"
"engagement with Mary Hamilton is likely to be broken by her family."""
"""Why, Baron Ned?"" she asked in surprise."
"""Count Hamilton has challenged me to a duel, to be fought when he"
"returns, and you see, if I kill him or if he kills me, well--"" I"
"answered, shrugging my shoulders."
"She was much alarmed at my disclosure, but was reassured when I made"
"light of the affair, probably because there was no danger in it to George"
"Hamilton, and, perhaps, because if I should kill Count Hamilton, George"
would inherit the title and estates.
"""But poor Mary! She will grieve,"" said Frances."
"""I think you need waste no tears for her sake,"" I answered. ""She is a"
"fine, pretty little creature, who will take what comes her way without"
excess of pain or joy. She is incapable of feeling keenly. God has been
"good to her in giving her numbness."""
"""No, no, cousin Ned, you are wrong!"" she returned. ""Life without pain"
"is not worth living. I have heard that the Arabs have a saying, 'All"
sunshine makes the desert.' God is good to us when he darkens the sun
"now and then and gives us the sunshine afterwards."""
"""Perhaps you are right, Frances,"" I returned. ""But you and I are in the"
"cloud now, and a little sunshine would be most welcome."""
"""Not enough sunshine to make a desert,"" she answered."
"""Say, Girl, was your answer final to-night about marrying me?"""
Without turning round the Girl answered coyly:
"""I might think it over, Jack."""
"Instantly the man's passion was aroused. He strode over to her, put his"
arms around her and kissed her forcibly.
"""I love you, I love you, Minnie!"" he cried passionately."
"In the struggle that followed, the Girl's eyes fell on the bottle on the"
mantel. With a cry she seized it and raised it threateningly over her
"head. Another second, however, she sank down upon a chair and began to"
"sob, her face buried in her hands."
"Rance regarded her coldly; at last he gave vent to a mirthless laugh,"
the nasty laugh of a man whose vanity is hurt.
"""So, it's as bad as that,"" he sneered. ""I didn't quite realise it. I'm"
"much obliged to you. Good-night."" He snatched up his coat, hesitated,"
"then repeated a little less angrily than before: ""Good-night!"""
"But the Girl, with her face still hidden, made no answer. For a moment"
"he watched the crouching form, the quivering shoulders, then asked, with"
sudden and unwonted gentleness:
"""Can't you say good-night to me, Girl!"""
"Slowly the Girl rose to her feet and faced him, aversion and pity"
"struggling for mastery. Then, as she noted the spot where he was now"
"""It ain't,"" said the crew suspiciously."
"""And even if it's all right, we bein' strangers might be led into"
makin' a treaty without knowin' all there is to know.  I vote waitin'
"till the officers comes up."""
They squatted down on rocks and on the lumps of tussac grass till the
captain and the two mates came along with the rest of the Frenchmen.
"Hart communicated his suspicions to the skipper, who was decidedly"
under the influence of alcohol.
"""That's all right,"" said the Guffin thickly.  ""_We_ can manage"
Frenchmen.  They ain't goin' to make no French Shore question on no
more of our islands.  One Newfoundland's enough for me.  I'll show
"you n'gotiations--'gotiashuns is my forte!""  And he led the way over"
the hill.  Below them they saw the wreck of a French barquantine.
"""Blimy,"" said the crowd, with a frown, ""if they 'aven't got the best"
"part of our hisland!"""
"It was not to be endured by any lot of Englishmen under the sun, that"
"the best part of this rock should be occupied by their natural foes,"
and soon there was evidence that in any attempt to turn the Frenchmen
out the British leader would have a united nation at his back.
"The Guffin and the two mates argued it, and Lampert was the"
Opposition.

think to 'ave shipped a Verning 'Arcourt among my lot?  You're a

glare of Port Townsend and saw in the distance the flashing
searchlights of the forts that guard the Straits. They saw him stop
"suddenly, and raise his night-glasses; Boyd laid his hand on Cherry's"
arm. Presently the Captain crossed to them and said:
"""Yonder seems to be a launch making out. See? I wonder what's up."""
"Almost in their path a tiny light was violently agitated. ""By Jove!"
"They're signalling."""
"""You won't stop, will you?"" questioned Emerson."
"""I don't know, I am sure. I may have to."""
"The two boats were drawing together rapidly, and soon those on the"
bridge heard the faint but increasing patter of a gasoline exhaust.
"Carrying the same speed as _The Bedford Castle_, the launch shortly"
came within hailing distance. The cyclopean eye of the ship's
"searchlight blazed up, and the next instant, out from the gloom leaped"
"a little craft, on the deck of which a man stood waving a lantern. She"
"held steadfastly to her course, and a voice floated up to them:"
"""Ahoy! What ship?"""
"""_The Bedford Castle_, cannery-tender for Bristol Bay,"" Peasley shouted"
back.
"The man on the launch relinquished his lantern, and using both palms"
"for a funnel, cried, more clearly now: ""Heave to! We want to come"
"aboard."""
"With an exclamation of impatience, the commanding officer stepped to"
"the telegraph, but Emerson forestalled him."
"It was a grief to Dick to part from his master; but he saw the need, and"
he loved the horse only second to Grey himself.
"""I will do your behest, master.  Nay, I want no money; I have plenty for"
all my needs.  I too have made some modest wealth here in this great
"city. Only tell me where I may find you, and I will be gone, and do what"
"can be done for the poor beast."""
"""You shall always get news of me at Wills’ Coffee House, good Dicon,"""
"was the answer.  ""Where I go and how I live, I know not yet; but I will"
"leave word there for you.  So now, farewell.  I turn a new page in my"
"life from this day forth."""

"Grey Dumaresq, having settled matters with his servant, and adjusted the"
"disarray of his own dress and person, turned towards a group of men who"
"were standing round Lord Sandford, making believe to laugh and jest, but"
showing some vague symptoms of uneasiness as they cast sidelong glances
in the direction of their erstwhile comrade.
"Grey walked straight up to Lord Sandford, and looked him full in the"
eyes.  Did the glance of the other quail ever so little before his?  He
"thought so, but could scarce be certain."
"spasm; her eyes are closed, her mouth open, and her jaw a bit"
dislocated. In front of the swooning saint is a little angel who
smilingly threatens her with an arrow.
"“Well, what do you think of it?” said Kennedy."
"“It is wonderful,” exclaimed Cæsar. “But it is a bedroom scene, only"
the lover has slipped away.”
"“Yes, that is true.”"
"“It really is pretty; you seem to see the pallor of the saint’s face,"
"the circles under her eyes, the relaxation of all her muscles. Then the"
angel is a little joker who stands there smiling at the ecstasy of the
saint.”
"“Yes, that’s true,” said Kennedy; “it is all the more admirable for the"
"very reason that it is tender, sensual, and charming, all at once.”"
"“However, this sort of thing is not healthy,” murmured Cæsar, “this"
kind of vision depletes your life-force. One wants to find the same
"things represented in works of art that one ought to look for in life,"
even if they are not to be found in life.”
"“Good! Here enters the moralist. You talk like an Englishman,” exclaimed"
Kennedy. “Let us go along.”
“Where?”
“I have to stop in at the French Embassy a moment; then we can go where
you like.”
"from Flatfolk ways."""
"""Flatfolk are the Venusian natives, aren't they? Are you a Venusian?"
"What part of Venus do you come from? Why did you say you hope--"""
He chuckled and swung me up into one of the bunks that lined the
"lifeboat. ""Questions you ask,"" he said in his soft voice. ""Venus is a"
"sharp enough place for a dryhorn, let alone a tadpole dryhorn with a"
"boss-minded sister."""
"""I'm not a dryleg,"" I told him proudly. ""_We're_ from Undersea."""
"""_Dryhorn_, I said, not dryleg. And what's Undersea?"""
"""Well, in Undersea we called foreigners and newcomers drylegs. Just"
"like on Venus, I guess, you call them dryhorns."" And then I told him"
"how Undersea had been built on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, when"
the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers
figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms.
*       *       *       *       *
He nodded. He'd heard about the sea-bottom mining cities that were
bubbling under protective domes in every one of the Earth's oceans just
about the same time settlements were springing up on the planets.
He looked impressed when I told him about Mom and Pop being one of the
first couples to get married in Undersea. He looked thoughtful when I
told him how Sis and I had been born there and spent half our childhood
listening to the pressure pumps. He raised his eyebrows and looked
"disgusted when I told how Mom, as Undersea representative on the World"
"Council, had been one of the framers of the Male Desuffrage Act after"
might have to say.
"""It's like this, you see,"" he went on hurriedly. ""Captain Dove's"
"absolutely at the end of his wits for money, and now--I can pay him his"
price for you if you'll keep your promise to me by and by. Otherwise I
"can't; no matter how willing I might be, I can't, I swear to you."
"""He feels, too, that you owe it to him to make up in one way or another"
for some part at least of what he and I have lost through your--your
"interfering so much lately in his affairs. And, if you don't back me up"
"now, he'll have to take the _Olive Branch_ East as best he can. He'll"
"take you too, and--you'll never come back."
"""You don't understand. I'm not really trying to force you to marry me,"
but to save you from a fate far worse than the worst you could imagine.
"You don't understand that it's really freedom I'm offering you, and that"
your only option is slavery.
"""You'd rather have a white man--even me!--for your husband, wouldn't"
"you? than a yellow one--or brown--or maybe black!"""
CHAPTER XIII
A MASTERSTROKE
"Sallie sat down quickly in a cushioned chair, and lay back, trembling"
like a captured bird.
on his chin.
The butler touched him upon his shirt-sleeve in dignified despair:
"“Gentlemen,” said he--“this is not decent. I repeat--it is not honest.”"
"“Go hon!” said Rippley, punching the old man in the ribs with his"
"elbow, and working away at the fixing of his throat-beard. “Look here,"
"Fluffy,” he called hurriedly--“you and Doome _must_ run this pompous"
old dolt downstairs and shoot him into the cellar--and lock him in.
Quick! or the people will be arriving.... I hear carriage-wheels.”
Robbins and Doome seized the shocked old man and hurried his protesting
stiff being out of the room and down the stairs.
"Rippley followed them to the top of the stairs, making up his disguise"
as he went:
"“Look here, boys,” he called down in a hoarse whisper--“if the old"
fool will swear not to move away from the hall door until we release
him you needn’t put him in the cellar.... What?... Eh?... He says he
surrenders? That’s all right then. Now back with you--quick! or the
guests will be here--or Pangbutt himself.”
There was a loud ring at the door-bell.
Rippley skipped back to the cabinet: and from the cabinet he ran to
Andrew Blotte:
"“Blotte, old boy,” said he, pulling a red wig over the gloomy man’s"
head and combing the lank red hair down the sides of his pale
face--“you must look after the cloak-room and change the tickets and

dory at an abandoned wharf near Sunset Lane.
"""Just as well not to show ourselves 'round Rockman's."""
"""When can we go out to the _Arabella_?"""
"""Not 'till four o'clock. We can go out to swim just like we always do."
Even if they see us they won't think it's funny for us to do that.
"They'd think it funnier if we didn't."""
"Sidney admitted the truth of this, but wondered how she could live"
until four o'clock!
"As they walked up Sunset Lane Sidney reminded Lavender that, because of"
"their promise, they ought to tell Mart. But when they stopped at the"
Calkins' house they found that Mart had already gone to Gert Bartow's.
"""Oh, dear,"" sighed Sidney, with an added pang of remorse."
At four o'clock Sidney and Lavender went out to the _Arabella_ to swim
as they had done always before Pola's coming. Except for a brightness
"in Sidney's eyes, an alertness about her whole body, and the occasional"
significant glances that passed between them they both appeared quite
normal. Lav talked casually of the heat of the day.
"""Gee, the water'll feel great. This is the hottest day we've had yet."""
"""I can't wait to get in."" Most certainly Jed Starrow, had he been"
"listening, could not have guessed how closely Nemesis pressed upon his"
heels!
"""The human animal is a strange creature. He's so capable of refusing to"
"believe what he doesn't want to believe."""
"""Maybe he's smarter than we think. Maybe there's no point in looking at"
a pending disaster from every angle. The what-will-be-will-be attitude
isn't necessarily like that of the ostrich which sticks its head in the
"sand."""
"""Do the people inside really believe?"" Entman asked."
"""It's pretty difficult to tell. Sometimes I wonder what my own real"
"feelings are."""
"""I wasn't completely briefed on how it ended,"" Entman said delicately."
"""I think the phony specifications got through."""
"""If they did--if things are really as they appear--"""
"Taber smiled in the darkness. ""Are _you_ beginning to doubt, Doctor?"""
"""Oh, be quiet,"" Entman said with friendly petulance. ""I was going to say"
that I was rather proud of those details. If our hostiles out there
"follow my specifications, they'll create androids with much smaller"
lungs and non-porous skin that will give them no end of trouble when
they start chasing frightened householders down the streets of the
"world."""
"Taber chuckled. ""I remember a story about the Japanese Navy. They were"
supposed to have built some ships to specifications stolen in England.
"When launched, they slid out into the bay and tipped over."""
"""No, by God, you'll not introduce her to the king! I'll explode the whole"
"affair, and Dunkirk may go to the devil before you shall introduce Betty"
"to the king,"" I answered."
"""Yet you are willing that I should meddle in the dangerous affair?"
"Evidently you love her more than you love me?"""
"""Only a few hundred million times more,"" I answered sullenly."
"""Is it that way with you, my dear brother?"" she asked, coming to me as I"
"stood gazing out the window, seeing nothing save Bettina's face. Frances"
"put her hand on my shoulder and said coaxingly: ""Forgive me. No harm"
"shall come to her through me."""
"Of course I was sorry that I had allowed myself to become angry, and at"
once made my apology as well as I could.
"""Let us go to see Betty, anyway,"" said Frances. And I assenting, she went"
"to fetch her cloak, hat, and vizard."
"But when she returned, I had changed my mind and declined to go, telling"
Frances that I must see Bettina no more.
"""Why?"" asked Frances."
"""Because I would not win a love from her which I cannot accept."""
"""Baron Ned, there are few men who would be so considerate."""
"But I required little coaxing, and when Frances had made ready for the"
"journey, I buckled on my sword, which I had left standing in the corner,"
"took my hat from the floor, and started out with her."

"possessed by the people who have worked for me in the past."""
"""All those petty criminals and hoods, you mean."""
"""I will choose to ignore that,"" he continued. ""Whatever you may wish to"
"call them, they are not proving entirely adequate to the task at hand."
You bested my European people repeatedly and brought me a decided
"humiliation."""
"Speaking of which, Vance found himself suddenly wondering, a thought"
"out of the blue, what's happened to Vera? She's been European point"
woman for this whole scam. Where's she now?
"Mino continued. ""Therefore I must now either take you into my"
"organization or . . ."" He paused. ""It's that simple. Which, I wonder,"
"will it be?"""
"Vance studied him. ""A lot depends on what happens to Eva."""
"""The fate of Dr. Borodin depends largely on your decision. So perhaps I"
"should give you some time to think it over."" He leaned back. ""Or"
"perhaps some inducement."""
Vance didn't know what he meant. At first. Then he turned and looked
behind him. There waiting on the stony walkway of the garden were three
"of Tanzan Mino's personal _kobun_, two of whom he recognized from"
"London. The CEO's instructions to them were in rapid-fire Japanese, but"
he needed no translation as they moved forward.
“It must be such an adventure. It must make you hold your breath and
your heart beat.”
John wondered grimly whether a certain doer of wickedness had felt this
"ecstatic rapture. She, too, must have seen the gray dawn, but creeping"
through prison-bars into her cell. God of Inscrutability! Was it
"possible that these two co-watchers of the dawn, both so dominant in his"
"life, were of the same race of beings? If the one was a woman born of"
"woman, what in the name of mystery was Stellamaris?"
"“Don't look so grave, Great High Belovedest,” she said, squeezing a"
finger. “I only spoke in fun. It must really be horrid to be wicked.
When I was little I had a book about Cruel Frederick--I think it
"belonged to grandmama. It had awful pictures, and there were rhymes--"
"He tore the wings off little flies,"
And then poked out their little eyes.
And there was a picture of his doing so. I used to think him a
detestable boy. It made me unhappy and kept me awake when I was quite
"small, but now I know it's all nonsense. People don't do such things, do"
they?”
"Risca twisted his glum face into a smile, remembering the Unwritten Law."
"“Of course not, Stellamaris,” said he. “Cruel Frederick is just as much"
"of a mythical personage as the Giant Fee-fo-fum, who said:"
"I smell the blood of an Englishman,"
"And be he alive or be he dead,"
something inevitable you might as well look at it from the more
"cheerful side. After all, there was the chance that we might not have"
"made it this far, you know. Now, tell me honestly, does it make sense"
getting all worried-up by thinking of how horrible it would have been
"if we'd been caught back there when Seventy-nine blew up?"""
"""I suppose not."""
"""Well, then,"" he said in a semi-cheerful tone, ""since we did make it"
"out safely, and are still waiting after eight days, we might as well"
"expect to be collected soon."""
"Charles Andrews said, from behind him, ""At a hundred dollars an hour,"
"Norton?"""
"Norton turned around angrily. ""So it's the hundred clams per,"" he"
"snapped back. ""That's damned poor payment for having to live with the"
"likes of you in a space can this cramped."""
"Andrews eyed the pilot with distaste. ""Tell me,"" he said smoothly,"
"""did my last effort on the pedal generator go for power storage, or"
for a couple of gallons of hot water for that shave and shower you've
"enjoyed?"""
"Norton stretched and stood up. ""I figured that having a clean face"
"might help morale,"" he said pointedly."
"""You're a cheap, chiseling--"""
"""Easy, Andrews! Easy. There's a lady present. Besides, I might forget"
"my easy-going nature and take a swing at you."""
"Coxon showed more interest now, and remarked,"
"""Why, Gaspard was one of Medland's organisers. I saw him with both"
"Medland and Norburn on Saturday."""
"""I don't suppose they were planning to murder this Benham. Indeed, I"
don't see that the thing can have been political at all. What did it
"matter whether Benham lived or died?"""
"""I don't see that it did, except to Benham,"" assented the Captain. ""But"
"what's become of Gaspard?"""
"""Ah, that they don't know. He's supposed to have taken ship, and they've"
"cabled to search all ships that left the port that morning."""
"""He'll find the man in blue--or the local equivalent--on the wharf,"""
"said the Captain. ""Rather a jar that, Sir Robert, when you're in from a"
"voyage. What are they doing now?"""
"""Well, the Superintendent said they were going to have a thorough search"
"through the dead man's lodgings, to see if they could find out anything"
about him which would throw light on the motive. The police don't think
"much of the political theory of the crime."""
"""Dashed nonsense, _I_ should think,"" said the Captain, and he sauntered"
off to play billiards.
"""That young man,"" said the Chief Justice, ""is really not a fool, though"
"he does his best to look like one."""
"""That queer conduct seems to me rather common in young men at home. I"
"The grace of her attitude, the intimacy of the scene, the pleasantness"
"of her greeting, made his task hateful."
"“No,” he said, with an asperity directed towards the disinvited guest."
“We shall dine alone to-night.”
"But his tone made Yvonne’s heart give a great throb, and she turned to"
him quickly.
“Has anything happened?”
"“A great deal,” said the Canon."
"Where he stood in the dusk of the doorway, the shadow accentuated the"
stern lines of his face and deepened the sombreness of his glance. His
brows were bent in perplexities of repugnance. It was horrible to demand
"of her such explanations. To Yvonne’s scared fancy, his brows seemed"
bent in accusation. That was the pity of it. For a few seconds they
"looked at one another, the Canon severely, Yvonne in throbbing suspense."
“What?” she asked at length.
"He paused for a moment, then threw his hat and the crumpled Visitors’"
List on to the table and plunged into the heart of things--but not
before Yvonne had glanced at the paper with a sudden pang of intuition.
"“Emmeline has discovered, Yvonne, that the man--”"
"He got no further. Yvonne rushed to him with a cry of pain, clung to his"
"arm, broke into wild words."
“Don’t say any more--don’t--don’t. Spare me--for pity’s sake. I did not
"As he walked, he thought again about the new rumor he'd heard in the"
commissary at lunch. Gossip kept the Soviet staff going--an instinct
from the old days--but this one just might be true. Some lower-level
staffers even claimed they'd seen him. The Chief.
Word was Tanzan Mino himself--none other than the CEO of the Daedalus
"Corporation--had flown in this morning, together with his personal"
bodyguards and aides. The story was he wanted hands-on control of the
"first hypersonic test flight, wanted to be calling the shots in Flight"
Control when _Daedalus I _made history.
Finally. The Big Man has decided to show his face.
"""Yuri Andreevich, just a minute. Slow down."""
He recognized the voice immediately and glanced around to see Nikolai
"Vasilevich Grishkov, the portly Soviet chief mechanic, just emerging"
from the West Quadrant. His bushy eyebrows hung like a pair of Siberian
musk-ox horns above his gleaming dark eyes.
"""Have you seen her?"" Grishkov was shuffling toward him."
"""Seen who?"" He examined the mechanic's spotless white coveralls. Jesus!"
"Even the support crews on this project were all sanitized, high-tech."
"""The new woman. _Kracevia, moi droog. Ochen kracevia_. Beautiful beyond"
"words. And she is important. You can tell just by looking."""
"""Nikolai, there's never been a woman in this facility."" He laughed and"
"continued on toward Security. ""It's worse than a goddam troop ship."
"You've finally started hallucinating from lack of _pezdyonka_."""
and the miracle of children’s being born from their mothers. The other
miracles I do not believe in. What for? They are so insignificant beside
the works of Nature!”
"“He is a pagan,” Kennedy again stated."
_YOUNG PAINTERS_
"They were chatting, when three young lads came into the tavern, all"
"three having the air of artists, black clothes, soft hats, flowing"
"cravats, long hair, and pipes. “Two of them are fellow-countrymen of"
"yours,” Kennedy told Cæsar."
"“They are Spanish painters,” the old man added. “The other is a sculptor"
"who has been in the Argentine, and he talks Spanish too.”"
The three entered and sat down at the same table and were introduced to
"Cæsar. Everybody chattered. Buonacossi, the Italian, was a real type."
"Of very low stature, he had a giant’s torso and strong little legs. His"
"head was like a woe-begone eagle, his nose hooked, thin, and reddish,"
"eyes round, and hair black."
"Buonacossi proved to be gay, exuberant, changeable, and full of"
vehemence.
"He explained his artistic ideas with picturesque warmth, mingling them"
with blasphemies and curses. Things struck him as the best or the worst
in the world. For him there doubtless were no middle terms.
"One of the two Spaniards was serious, grave, jaundiced, sour-visaged,"
men.

"Brand stared sympathetically at her. ""They treat them very badly?"" he"
asked gently.
"""Terribly! Terribly!"" said Greca, shuddering again."
"""But you seem quite privileged,"" he could not help saying."
"She shook her dainty head pathetically. ""I am of high rank among my"
"people. I am a priestess of our religion, which is the religion of The"
"Great White One who rules all the sky everywhere. The Rogans"" (it was"
the best translation Brand could make of her mental term for the slimy
"tall things that held them captive) ""--the Rogans hold my fate over"
"the heads of my race. Should they rebel, I would be thrown to the"
monster in the pen. Of course the Rogans could crush any revolt with
"their terrible tubes, but they do not want to kill their slaves if"
they can help it. They find it more effective to hold their
"priestesses in hostage."""
Brand turned from personal history to more vital subjects.
"""Why,"" he asked Greca, ""are the shining red squares of metal laid"
"everywhere over this empire of the Rogans?"""
"""To make things light,"" was the reply. ""When the Rogans first came to"
"this mighty sphere, they could hardly move. Things are so heavy here,"
somehow. So their first thought was to drive my enslaved people to the
casting and laying of the metal squares and the metal beams that
"connect them, in order to make things weigh less."""
"shot."""
The patrolman wanted to believe. He most pathetically wanted to believe.
"""Honest?"""
"""It's the God's honest truth. No man could have stood in front of that"
killer and pulled a trigger. He's a master hypnotist. You're all right.
We won't say a word about what happened in here. And you'll have no
"trouble in the future."""
"The patrolman shook his head. ""Still, I gotta do something about it."""
"""Talk to your psychiatrist,"" Taber said. ""In the meantime, keep that"
"crowd out there from spilling in here."""
Taber pushed out through the choked entrance to the areaway and went
back up the street. It was alive with activity now and he passed
unnoticed. No one recognized him as the man who had given chase in the
bloody business that would make headlines that evening in every New York
newspaper.
And yet the radio and TV news commentators gave it no special attention.
It went in along with other items of the day's news as a more or less
routine big-city happening.
"One national-hookup headliner stated: ""In New York City today, a man"
"identified as John Dennis, address unknown, went berserk in a"
"fashionable Upper East Side apartment. Dennis, wielding a knife, killed"
"a man and a woman, and seriously wounded another man before he was cut"
down by police bullets.
"""A jet airliner, down in the North Atlantic today, imperiled the lives"
murmured.
"The Mater turned her gentle eyes to the fire, and Dad, clearing his"
throat in a blustering way--though he was not at all a blustering
man--replied:
"""Perhaps it's rather decent of us to have a son who--er, I mean,"
"who--well, er----"""
"""A cruise hits me right,"" I exclaimed, hurriedly coming to his rescue,"
"for neither of us wanted a scene. ""And I'll wire Tommy Davis, Mater--the"
chap you mentioned. He's a corking fellow! I didn't write you how the
battalion started calling him 'Rebel' till he closed up half a dozen
"eyes, did I? You see, in the beginning, when we were rookies, the"
"sergeant had us up in formation to get our names, and when he came to"
"Tommy that innocent drawled: 'Mr. Thomas Jefferson Davis, suh, of"
"Loui'ville, Jefferson county, Kentucky, suh.' You could have heard a pin"
"drop. The sergeant, as hard-boiled as they come, stood perfectly still"
"and let a cold eye bore into him for half a minute, then gasped: 'Gawd!"
"What a wicked little rebel!'"""
They laughed.
"""Why didn't you bring him home with you?"""
"""Same reason he couldn't take me home with him. There were people"
"waiting, and turkey, and--but he won't want to go,"" I added. ""He's crazy"
"about a girl down there!"""
"""Fiddlesticks,"" my father chuckled. ""Any normal fellow'll want to"
"cruise! I'll wire him myself--this very night!"""
"""No one can say. A day, a week, a month, a year--it is an elusive search"
"I follow, my young friends. May I call you that?"""
"We bowed, and I deferentially suggested:"
"""If we can help you in any way?----"""
"""It is the beautiful spirit of America,"" he sighed, ""to help those in"
"distress, yet there is nothing to do but watch--watch. For you have not"
"yet been here long enough to see a child in these waters--no?"""
"Tommy, perhaps because he came from the South and was on more or less"
"friendly terms with superstitions, glanced over the rail as if an infant"
might be floating around almost anywhere. Our strange guest's mysterious
"hints were, indeed, rather conducive to creeps."
"Then, without further comment, he arose, tossed his cigar overboard, ran"
"his fingers through his mass of hair, and went below."
"""What d'you suppose he meant?"" I asked, in a guarded voice."
"""Simple enough,"" Tommy whispered. ""He's got apartments to let"
"upstairs."""
"""Get out, man,"" I laughed. ""That chap has more sense than either of us!"""
"""Then he'd better come across with some of it. You remember the freckled"
"lad at Soissons who got fuzzy-headed from too much concussion? Well, he"
"saw children around everywhere, too! It's a sure sign, Jack!"" But now he"
"laughed, adding: ""Oh, I suppose our little Roumanian's all right,"
"only----"""
"""Attacked!"" she echoed in surprise.  ""No one attacked me."""
"""I did not mean that,"" I answered, rather puzzled at her quick protest."
"""I meant that you were probably aware of the symptoms which preceded"
"your unconsciousness."""
"""I felt a strange dizziness and a curious tightness in the throat and"
chest.  That is all I remember.  All became blank until I opened my eyes
"again and found myself lying here, with these two gentlemen standing at"
my side.  The duration of my unconsciousness did not appear to me longer
"than a few minutes."""
"""Then mademoiselle has no idea of the cause of her strange illness?"""
"inquired Deane in French.  ""None whatever, m'sieur."""
"""Tell us one fact,"" he urged.  ""During the time which elapsed between"
"your parting with M'sieur Ingram and your sudden unconsciousness, did"
"anyone enter the room?"""
"""No one; of that I am absolutely certain."""
"""How were you occupied during that time?"""
"""I was writing a letter."""
"""And before you rose did you feel the curious giddiness?"""
"""No, not until after I stood up.  I tried to shout and attract help, but"
"could not.  Then I reached to press the bell, but stumbled forward, and"
"the next instant I was lost in what seemed to be a dense fog."""
"""Curious!"" ejaculated Trepard, who stood by with folded arms, eagerly"
"write one. I also suggested that we meet in Bettina's parlor, where"
Frances's letter could be rewritten in cipher. We trusted Bettina as we
"trusted ourselves, and when we told her the good news, she clapped her"
"hands for joy, laughing, yet ready to weep, and was as happy as even she"
"could be, which was very happy indeed."
"After we had talked, laughed, and cried a reasonable time in Betty's"
"parlor, Frances handed me her letter, which was a bulky document, well"
taped and waxed.
"""It will require a week for me to translate this,"" I remarked, weighing"
the letter in my hand.
"""What do you mean by translating it?"" she asked in surprise."
"""I must write it out in cipher. Hamilton directed that all letters should"
"be sent in that form,"" I answered, amused at her alarm."
"""No, no!"" she cried, snatching the letter from me, pressing it to her"
"breast and blushing to her ears. ""You shall not see my letter!"""
"""Why?"" I asked."
"""Because,"" she answered."
"""That is no reason,"" I replied. ""Of course you have written nothing that"
"you would not want me or your father to see?"""
"""Well, yes, I have,"" she returned emphatically. ""A great deal. Would you,"
"Betty, want any one to see such a letter written by yourself?"""
"""I suppose I could write a letter which I should want but one person in"
head.
"""One must learn by experience,"" Petunikoff reassured him, lighting a"
cigarette.
"""Learn ...  It is not that, my dear sir; but don't you see there is no"
freedom?  Don't you see what a life I lead?  I live in fear and

the papers.  Sanitary inspectors will be called for ... fines will have
to be paid ... or else your lodgers will set fire to the place or rob
and kill me ... I am powerless against them.  They are not the least
"afraid of the police, and they like going to prison, because they get"
"their food for nothing there."""
"""But then we will have them turned out if we come to terms with you,"""
promised Petunikoff.
"""What shall we arrange, then?"" asked Vaviloff, sadly and seriously."
"""Tell me your terms."""
"""Well, give me the six hundred mentioned in the claim."""
"""Won't you take a hundred roubles?"" asked the merchant, calmly, looking"
"attentively at his companion, and smiling softly.  ""I will not give you"
"one rouble more,"" ... he added."
"After this, he took out his eye-glasses, and began cleaning them with"
his handkerchief.  Vaviloff looked at him sadly and respectfully.  The
"calm face of Petunikoff, his grey eyes and clear complexion, every line"
of his thickset body betokened self-confidence and a well-balanced
"If an ewe gives birth to an ox, the weapons of the ruler will prevail"
over the weapons of the enemy.
"If an ewe gives birth to an ox that has _ganni_[87], the ruler will"
weaken the land of his enemy.
"If an ewe gives birth to an ox with two tails, omen of Ishbi-Ura[88],"
who was without a rival.
"If an ewe gives birth to a cow, the king will die, another king will"
draw nigh and divide the country.
One might have supposed that such omens represent a purely imaginative
"theoretical factor, but the introduction of the historical reference"
proves conclusively that the Babylonians and Assyrians attached an
"was--different,' she whispered."
'How?' my lady muttered.
"'He swore at me,' Marie answered in the same tone. 'And he spoke of"
you--somehow differently.'
"The Countess laughed, but far from joyously. 'I suppose to-night--I"
must see him?' she said. She tried as she spoke to press herself more
"deeply into the pillows, as if she might escape that way. Her flesh"
"crept, and she shivered though she was as hot as fire."
Once or twice in the hours which followed she was almost beside
herself. Sometimes she prayed. More often she walked up and down the
"room like one in a fever. She did not know on what she was trusting,"
"and she could have struck Marie when the girl, appealed to again and"
"it, though we know better. Do not disown us. You know how triumphantly"
"certain letters of yours are circulated, in which, to protect yourself"
"from suspicion, you rather meanly fasten it on others ... If you are now"
"afraid to incur a little hostility for _my_ sake, concede me at least"
"that you will not allow yourself, out of fear for another, to be tempted"
to renounce me; rather be silent about me.'
Those were bitter reproaches. In the man who had to swallow them there
"was a puny Erasmus who deserved those reproaches, who took offence at"
"them, but did not take them to heart, who continued to act with prudent"
reserve till Hutten's friendship was turned to hatred. In him was also a
"great Erasmus who knew how, under the passion and infatuation with which"
"the parties combated each other, the Truth he sought, and the Love he"
"hoped would subdue the world, were obscured; who knew the God whom he"
professed too high to take sides. Let us try ever to see of that great
Erasmus as much as the petty one permits.

AT LOUVAIN
"""Now you're talking!"" he retorted approvingly. ""Say what's in your mind,"
"straightforwardly, and we'll soon come to an understanding. Sit down"
"again, you strutting peacock! and tell me what it is you want."""
"Slyne did not sit down again, however; to do so would scarcely have been"
"dignified. He stayed in the doorway, silent, a thin stream of"
"cigarette-smoke slowly filtering from his nostrils. His cold,"
calculating eyes were once more on Captain Dove's. And it was Captain
Dove's would-be mocking glance that at length gave way.
"""You offered to give me Sallie, if I paid you a hundred thousand"
"dollars,"" said Slyne, judicially."
"""To see you safely married to her,"" Captain Dove corrected him."
"Slyne nodded, in grave assent."
"""Well, I'm going to hold you to your offer,"" said he. ""The money's ready"
and waiting for you--just as soon as we can settle a few trifling
"formalities. I have Sallie's promise to marry me--"""
"""The devil you have!"" said Captain Dove, not slow to seize opportunity"
"either. ""I thought I heard her say--"""
"Slyne's face darkened again. ""And, if you'll come ashore with me now,"""
"he went on, controlling his temper, ""I'll prove to you that your money"
"is perfectly safe."""
"Captain Dove lay back in his bunk and laughed, most discordantly. He"
"laughed till his red-rimmed eyes were adrip, while Slyne sat looking at"
"him. He was still laughing when Slyne rose and, flicking the"
"cigarette-end from between two nicotine-stained fingers, began to button"
"""Or open the cottage, if you'd rather,"" she excitedly interrupted him."
"""I hadn't intended leaving New York this winter, but will chaperon a"
"house party if you like!"""
"""Fiddlesticks! Cruise, by all means,"" he spoke with good-natured"
"emphasis. ""Get another fellow, and go after adventures and romances and"
"that kind of thing! Go after 'em hammer and tongs! By George, that's"
"what I'd do if I were a boy, and had the chance!"""
"They waited, rather expectantly."
"""Cruising's all right,"" I said, without enthusiasm. ""But it's a waste of"
"time to go after romance and adventure. They died with the war."""
"""Ho!--they did, did they?"" he laughed in mock derision. ""What's become"
"of your imagination--your vaporings? You used to be full of it!"" And the"
Mater supported him by exclaiming:
"""Why, Jack Bronx! And I used to call you my Pantheist! Don't tell me"
your second sight for discovering the beautiful in things has failed
"you!"""
"""It got put out by mustard gas, maybe,"" I murmured, remembering with"
bitterness some of the fellows who had been with me.
"What was romance here to the colorful, high-tensioned thing I had seen"
in devastated areas where loves of all gradations were torn and
scattered and trampled into the earth like chaff! Fretfully I told them
this.
"They exchanged glances, yet she continued in coaxing vein:"
CHAPTER XXVII.
THE HOUSE IN THE CHURCHYARD.
The heat which Count Leuchtenstein had thrown into the matter
"surprised me somewhat when I came to think of it, but I was soon to be"
"more surprised. I did not go to my lady at once on coming in, for on"
"the landing the sound of voices and laughter met me, and I learned"
that there were still two or three young officers sitting with her who
had outstayed Count Hugo. I waited until they were gone--clanking and
"jingling down the stairs; and then, about the hour at which I usually"
"went to take orders before retiring, I knocked at the door."
Commonly one of the women opened to me. To-night the door remained
"closed. I waited, knocked again, and then went in. I could see no one,"
"but the lamps were flickering, and I saw that the window was open."
"At that moment, while I stood uncertain, she came in through it; and"
"blinded, I suppose, by the lights, did not see me. For at the first"
"chair she reached just within the window, she sat down suddenly and"
burst into tears!
'Mein Gott!' I cried clumsily. I should have known better; but the
laughter of the young fellows as they trooped down the stairs was
"still in my ears, and I was dumfounded."
"She sprang up on the instant, and glared at me through her tears. 'Who"
are--how dare you? How dare you come into the room without knocking?'
she cried violently.
"'I did knock, my lady,' I stammered, 'asking your pardon.'"
"""Sallie--_Harris!_"" Mr. Jobling ejaculated. ""Dear me! Did you say"
"Sallie--er--Harris?"""
"""I said Saleh Harez,"" affirmed Captain Dove, and filled the glass at his"
"elbow again. ""But all that concerns you, so far's I can see, is that"
I've known her ever since she was knee-high to me. I've been a father to
"her all those years, and she's my adopted daughter. So now, you can take"
"it from me, Mr. Jobling, that I'm the joker, and both bowers too, in"
"this merry little game."""
"""Which makes it all the more unfortunate for you that you haven't a"
"single penny to stake on your hand,"" Slyne put in, while the lawyer"
"looked somewhat blankly from one to the other of them. ""So--don't waste"
"any more time bluffing, but tell Jobling how you found Sal--Lady"
"Josceline."""
"Captain Dove darted a very evil look at his friendly adviser. ""And what"
"if I refuse?"" he asked."
"Slyne almost smiled. ""Why cut off your own nose to spite your face?"" he"
"returned. ""You won't refuse, because it would cost you a hundred"
"thousand dollars to do so."""
"Captain Dove stroked his chin contemplatively, and his face slowly"
cleared.
"""A hundred and fifty thousand, you mean,"" he said in a most malevolent"
tone.
"Slyne got up from the table as if in anger, and for some time the two"
"wrangled over that point, the stout solicitor gazing at them with"
"evident dismay, while Sallie awaited the upshot of it all with bated"
sob.
"""Surely there is confidence between us?""  I urged.  ""Do you not remember"
"that day long ago when we walked one evening in the sunset hand-in-hand,"
"as was our wont, along the river-path towards La Roche?  Do you not"
remember how you told me that in future you would have no single secret
"from me?"""
"""Yes,"" she answered hoarsely, with an effort, ""I recollect."""
"""Then you intend to break your promise to me?""  I whispered earnestly."
"""Surely you will not do this, Yolande?  You will not hide from me the"
"cause of all this bitterness of yours?""  She was silent.  Her breast,"
"beneath its lace, rose quickly and fell again.  Her tear-filled eyes"
were fixed upon the carpet.
"""I would not break my promise,"" she said at last, clasping my hand"
"convulsively and lifting her eyes to mine; ""but, alas! it is now"
"imperative."""
"""Why imperative?"""
"""I must suffer alone,"" she responded gloomily, shaking her head.  Her"
"countenance was as pale as her gown, and she shivered as though she were"
"cold, although the noonday heat was suffocating."
"""Because you refuse to tell me anything or allow me to assist you?""  I"
"said.  ""This is not in accordance with the promise made and sealed by"
"your lips on that evening long ago."""
"""Nor have your actions been in accordance with your own promise,"" she"
said slowly and distinctly.
The man swelled with determination and pride. He had no thought of
"failure, and drew inspiration and joy from the heaviness of the bet"
which he had made with Fortune. He took the born gambler's delight in
a big risk.
"""Then you think that the _Antinous_ and the _Antigone_ were both"
"damaged by the same man, and that he may have designs upon the"
"_Malplaquet_?"" said I."
"""I don't propose to tell you what I think,"" replied Dawson stiffly."
"""Still,"" I persisted, passing over the snub, ""you have a theory?"""
"""No, thanks,"" said Dawson contemptuously. ""I have no use for theories."
"When they are wrong they mislead you, and when they are right they are"
no help. I believe in facts--facts brought out by constant vigilance.
"Unsleeping watchfulness and universal suspicion, those are the"
"principles I work on. The theory business makes pretty story books,"
"but the Force does not waste good time over them."""
"""What are you going to do?"""
"""This is Thursday afternoon. I am going to join the _Malplaquet_"
"presently, and I'm not going to sleep till she is safely down the"
"river. I'm going to be my own watchman this time."""
"""How? In what capacity?"""
"Dawson gave a shrug of impatience, for his nerves were on edge. For a"
"moment he hesitated, and then, recollecting the high post to which I"
"had tacitly been appointed in his household, he replied:"
road.
"Eilert was going out in his boat to fish haddock, and I went with him."
Actually he should have been getting some meat for us; but he had promised
"the gentry from the city some fish, and fish was one of the gifts of God."
"Besides, if he lacked meat, he could always slaughter one of the pigs."
"There was a slight wind; but then we wanted some wind, Eilert said, as"
long as there was not too much of it.
"""Not reliable tonight though,"" he said, looking up into the sky; ""the"
"bigger the wind, the stronger the current."""
"At first I was very brave, and sat on the thwart thinking of Eilert's"
"French words: _travali, prekevary, sutinary, mankémang_, and many"
"others. They've had a long way to travel, coming here by ancient routes"
"via Bergen, and now they're common property."
"And then suddenly I lost all interest in French words, and felt extremely"
"ill. It was much too windy, and we got no haddock."
"""Pity she's come up so quick,"" said Eilert; ""let's try inshore for a"
"while."""
"But we got nothing there either, and as the wind increased and the sea"
"rose, ""We'd better go home,"" said Eilert."
"The sea had been just right before, remarkably so, but now there was"
entirely too much of it. Why on earth did I feel so bad? An inner
"exhaustion, some emotional excitement, would have explained it. But I had"
experienced no emotional excitement.
"words on any subject as fast as pen could travel, no matter what torture"
"burned his brain, could not find a foolish message for a sick child. At"
last he wrote like a school-boy:
"_Darling: The flowers were beautiful, and so is the new picture, and I"
want to see you early in the morning. I hope you are well. John Risca._
And he had to tear the letter out of its envelope and put it into a
fresh one because he had omitted to add the magic initials “G. H. B.” to
"his name. Compared with his usual imaginative feats of correspondence,"
this was a poverty-stricken epistle. She would wonder at the change.
"Perhaps his demand for an immediate interview would startle her, and"
"shocks were dangerous. He tore up the letter and envelope, and went to"
his own room. It was past two o'clock when he crept downstairs again to
lay his letter on the hall table.
At the sight of him the next morning the color deepened in the delicate
"cheeks of Stellamaris, and her dark eyes grew bright. She held out a"
welcoming hand.
"“Ah, Belovedest, I 've been longing to see you ever since dawn. I woke"
up then and could n't go to sleep again because I was so excited.”
"He took the chair by her bedside, and her fingers tapped affectionately"
on the back of the great hand that lay on the coverlid.
"“I suppose I was excited, too,” said he, “for I was awake at dawn.”"
“Did you look out of window?”
"“Yes,” said John."
"""A friend who knows you both.""  Then she added: ""From my information I"
hear that last season you danced so much with her and were so constantly
"at her side that people were talking of a match between you."""
"""Ridiculous!""  I exclaimed.  ""Of course gossips are always too ready to"
"jump to ill-formed conclusions.  As one of the staff of the Embassy, and"
"her most intimate male friend, it was only courtesy to take her beneath"
"my care.  When she had no other partner and wanted to dance, then she"
"sometimes asked me.  I think she did it to annoy me, for she knew that I"
"was never fond of dancing."""
"""Do you remember the Countess of Flanders' balls at Brussels--how we"
"danced together?"" she remarked."
"""Remember them!""  I echoed.  ""They were in the golden days when"
everything seemed to our eyes couleur de rose--the days when our love
"was perfect."""
"She sighed again, but no word escaped her.  She was, I knew, reflecting"
upon those blissful days and nights when we met here and there at all
"hours and at all the best houses in Brussels, dining, lunching, dancing,"
and gossiping--together always.
"""Will you not resolve to forget the past, Yolande?""  I asked fervently,"
"taking her hand in mine again.  ""Come, tell me that you will--that you"
"will not hold me aloof like this?  I cannot bear it--indeed I can't, for"
"I love you;"" and I bent until my lips touched her finger-tips."
"""I cannot!"" she cried at last, with an effort rising and firmly"
withdrawing her hand from my grasp.
"""Jack,"" I prompted, more than ever embarrassed and wishing the ocean"
"would come up and swallow me; for I realized, alas, that my gods, by"
"whom I was reasonably well remembered in so far as concerned physique,"
had been shamelessly remiss in their bestowal of brains.
"""Jack?"" she slowly repeated. ""What an odd name!"""
This made me feel queer.
"""Where do you live,"" I asked, ""that you think it's an odd name? The"
"States are crawling with Jacks! It's even the Democratic emblem!"""
Her perplexity was fast approaching alarm when we heard a muffled report
"above, followed by a trembling of the yacht. Someone called an order"
that sounded far away in the wind.
"""Hold tight,"" I said, ""while I see if anything's wrong!"""
"But I did not leave her side, knowing exactly what had happened. We had"
"snapped our mainsheet, that was all; letting the boom swing out and"
putting us in the trough of the waves where we might expect a few wobbly
minutes until the sailors could work in a new line. There was no danger
"and I reassured her at once, but she merely asked:"
"""Was my father on deck?"""
"""I didn't look,"" I answered, wondering why she thought I knew."
"""Won't you see?"" Her patience was becoming exhausted."
"""I'm crazy to. But first let me help you back--you can't make it"
"sheer ecstatic bravado, emitted a Tarzan roar."
Instantly a weight hit the door from the outside. It shuddered but did
"not give. Dennis crouched, gripping his knife. Frank Corson staggered to"
his feet and hurled himself groggily at the android. Dennis roared
"again, pushed away and arced the knife at his throat."
"Rhoda screamed and lunged at Dennis' legs. ""No! No! Stop it! Please!"""
Dennis teetered under her weight and the knife slanted downward across
Frank's chest. It ripped a red gash as the door shuddered a third time.
Dennis turned in that direction and crouched. The door splintered and
"flew open. Dennis lunged, like a line-bucking football player. He hit"
"both Brent Taber and Captain Abrams simultaneously, sprawling them both"
and sending Abrams' gun spinning out of his hand.
He leaped over them and dashed down the hall where the elevator man
"waited uncertainly, not sure whether to dispute the right of way or not."
"His indecision was fatal. Dennis wrapped an arm around his neck, pulled"
his head back and cut his throat with one slash of the knife.
Captain Abrams' head had hit a doorjamb opposite the entrance to Rhoda's
apartment. He stirred and tried to come erect but he was unable to make
it.
Brent Taber clawed the gun off the floor and came to one knee. He got
off one shot as the elevator door was closing and saw the android spin
away from the controls as the impact of the slug smashed the bone of his
shoulder.
Taber lunged to his feet and went for the stairs.
"of your naval inquisitiveness."""
"Dawson told his story, and the naval officer's keen kindly face grew"
"stern and hard. ""Germans I can respect,"" said he, ""even those that"
pretend to be our friends. But one of our own folk--to sell us like
"this--ugh! Take the vermin away; Dawson, and stamp upon it."""
"We stood talking for a few moments, and then Dawson broke in with a"
"question. ""I have never understood, Admiral, why you were so very"
confident that Mr. Copplestone here had no hand in this business. The
"case against him looked pretty ugly, yet you laughed at it all the"
"time. Why were you so sure?"""
The Admiral surveyed Dawson as if he were some strange creature from
"an unknown world. ""Mr. Copplestone is a friend of mine,"" said he"
drily.
"""Very likely,"" snapped the detective. ""But is a man a white angel"
"because he has the honour to be your friend?"""
"""A fair retort,"" commented the Admiral. It happens that I had other"
and better reasons. For in July I myself showed Mr. Copplestone over
"the new battleship _Rampagious_, and after our inspection we both"
lunched with the builders and discussed her design and armament in
"every detail. So as Mr. Copplestone knew all about her in July, he was"
"not likely to suborn a draughtsman in November. See?"""
"""You should have told me this before. It was your duty."""
"""My good Dawson,"" said the Admiral gently, ""you are an excellent"
"officer of police, but even you have a few things yet to learn. I had"
"in my mind to give you a lesson, especially as I owed you some"
and a glass; but in the act of pouring out a drink for him there came a
"loud rap on the window, and quickly looking round she saw Rance's"
"piercing eyes peering into the room. For an instant she paled, but then"
there flashed through her mind the comforting thought that the Sheriff
"could not possibly see Johnson from his position. So, after giving the"
"latter his drink, she waited quietly until a rap at the door told her"
"that Rance had left the window when, her eye having lit on the ladder"
"that was held in place on the ceiling, she quickly ran over to it and"
"let it down, saying:"
"""Go up the ladder! Climb up there to the loft You're the man that's got"
"my first kiss an' I'm goin' to save you . . ."""
"""Oh, no, not here,"" protested Johnson, stubbornly."
"""Do you want them to see you in my cabin?"" she cried reproachfully,"
trying to lift him to his feet.
"""Oh, hurry, hurry . . .!"""
With the utmost difficulty Johnson rose to his feet and catching the
rounds of the ladder he began to ascend. But after going up a few rounds
"he reeled and almost fell off, gasping:"
"""I can't make it--no, I can't . . ."""
"""Yes, you can,"" encouraged the Girl; and then, simultaneously with"
"another loud knock on the door: ""You're the man I love an' you"
"must--you've got to show me the man that's in you. Oh, go on, go on,"
"jest a step an' you'll git there."""
"""But I can't,"" came feebly from the voice above. Nevertheless, the next"
"""By the time I'm through here, Sallie will be ready to go ashore."""
"Captain Dove looked very fiercely at him, but without effect."
"""Sallie won't stir a step from the ship,"" the old man affirmed, ""till"
"you've handed over the cash."""
"Slyne looked up, in mild surprise."
"""But, dear me! Dove,"" he remarked, ""you don't expect that the London"
lawyer's going to take my word for a girl he's never even seen? Until
"he's satisfied on that point, he won't endorse my note to you. So we've"
_got_ to take her along with us. I'm doing my best to give you a square
"deal; and all I ask in return is a square deal from you."""
"""You'd better not try any crooked games with me,"" growled Captain Dove,"
and sat for a time sunk in obviously aggravating reflections.
"""If we get on his soft side,"" suggested Slyne insidiously, ""there's no"
"saying how much more we might both make."""
Captain Dove rose and retired into his sleeping-cabin without further
"words; while Slyne, picking out with a two-pronged fork the cleanest of"
"the beans on his plate, smiled sneeringly to himself."
"""What's the latest long-shore fashion, Slyne?"" the old man asked after"
an interval. Slyne knew by his tone that he had dismissed dull care from
his mind and was prepared to be quarrelsome again.
"""It wouldn't suit a figure like yours,"" he answered coolly, and was"
"gratified to hear another hoarse growl. For, strange though it may seem,"
"Captain Dove was not without vanity. ""All you really need to worry about"
"Lights were flashing here and there, and when Jimmie at last found"
"himself inside the chimney, he knew that the very room he had recently"
left was being occupied by the outlaws.
"The electric light was out again, and the boy groped with his hands in"
the darkness. Much to his surprise they failed to locate his chum.
“Ned!” he called softly. “Where are you hiding?”
Jimmie heard a chuckle in the darkness and felt a hand on his shoulder.
Then Ned whispered in his ear:
“I guess I’ve stumbled on one of the hidden cells of the mission!” he
said. “Anyway there’s a hole leading out of this chimney that’s big
enough to keep house in.”
"“We’ll be finding a train of cars and an East river ferryboat next,”"
Jimmie chuckled. “We always do find something when we go away from camp.
"If we don’t find anything else, we find trouble.”"
"It was thought safe, now, to turn on the electric light. The rays showed"
a room perhaps twelve feet in size with furniture and furnishings of the
description of those in the chamber below. Although the apartment seemed
to be somewhere near the center of a lofty finger of rock which lifted
"from the eastern slope of the mountain, the air was remarkably fresh and"
pure.
"“There’s an opening somewhere,” Ned suggested. “A shut-in room like this"
would asphyxiate one if there were no ventilation.”
“Then I think we’d better be finding it!” Jimmie advised. “Just listen
to those fellows chewing the rag in the room we recently left!”
cranks as ever handled timber.  So the clerk said.  And one had a
hankerin' for teak and another for hoak (with odd leanin's now and
"agin for Hafrican and Portugee and French hoak), and another he said"
"'Cuban Sabicu,' and another's word was 'Hackmatack' and 'chestnut'"
hevery time.  So they shoved in bits here and bits there till she was
a reg'lar junk-shop o' samples.  And that's the reason she's a
"foreign talking argument ship.  And a mighty good reason too."""
The crowd listened in silence.
"""If you knew as much about arguin' as you know (_seemin'ly_) about"
"timbers as no man ever heerd of, your argument might stand,"" said"
"Mackenzie, a withered old foc'sle man.  ""But it ain't to reason as"
the natur' of the woods in a ship should make us talk this way or
"that.  If so be a ship was built o' teak, d'ye think we'd talk the"
"'jildy jow,' you black 'son of a gun' lingo?"""
Hart shook his head.
"""No ship ain't never built all of teak as I ever heerd of, and so"
"your eye's out, Mac.  But a man with 'arf an eye could see the"
knowledge of her bein' so built might lead right hup to talk about
"the stren'ths of the countries as well of the vally of their timbers."""
"""So they might,"" said the almost convinced crowd.  ""Now Jack Hart 'as"
"the gift, so to speak, of seein' through things."""
"""And once started, who'd stop it?"" asked Jack triumphantly.  ""I"
"knowed a ship as 'ad fresh crowd after fresh crowd in her, but she"
for ever 'ad a black cat aboard.  And they talked 'cat' to make you
sick.  And I knowed another as 'ad from launch to her hultimate

"At that hour before the theatres rose, a lull brooded in the London"
"streets; in this quiet narrow one, the town's hum was only broken by the"
clack of a half-drunken woman bickering at her man as they lurched along
"for home, and the strains of a street musician's fiddle, trying to make"
"up for a blank day.  The sound vaguely irritated Winton, reminding him of"
those two damnable foreigners by whom she had been so treated.  To have
them at the point of a sword or pistol--to teach them a lesson!  He heard
her say:
"""Dad, I should like to pay his debts.  Then things would be as they were"
"when I married him."""
He emitted an exasperated sound.  He did not believe in heaping coals of
fire.
"""I want to make sure, too, that the girl is all right till she's over her"
"trouble.  Perhaps I could use some of that--that other money, if mine is"
"all tied up?"""
"It was sheer anger, not disapproval of her impulse, that made him"
hesitate; money and revenge would never be associated in his mind. Gyp
went on:
"""I want to feel as if I'd never let him marry me.  Perhaps his debts are"
"all part of that--who knows?  Please!"""
"Winton looked at her.  How like--when she said that ""Please!""  How"
"like--her figure sunk back in the old chair, and the face lifted in"
shadow!  A sort of exultation came to him.  He had got her back--had got
her back!
"tears was ready to accompany her tale of woe, so I said hurriedly: ""Don't"
"cry. Laugh while you speak. You will attract less attention."""
"She tried to laugh, but the effort was piteous and became a failure, as"
she said:--
"""George Hamilton has sailed for Canada, and my heart is broken."""

"night at the queen's ball, the king showed me a letter sent by order of"
"the French king, saying that George had sailed from Bordeaux for Canada"
"nearly a fortnight ago. I could not help showing my grief, and the king,"
"who was boisterously happy, said: 'Now you will forget him and listen to"
"me.' I smiled, but it was a poor effort, and he smiled, showing his"
yellow fangs as he left me. I pray God that I may never be called upon to
"hate another man as I hate him."""
"""I can hardly believe that George has gone to Canada without notifying"
"us,"" I said."
"""Yes, I fear it is true,"" she returned. ""But if I am ever so fortunate"
"as to find him again, I intend to go with him whether he consents or no,"
regardless of father and all the world. Just as soon as I learn where he
"is in Canada, I will go to him. You will take me, won't you, Baron Ned?"""
"""I'll not give that promise,"" I answered. ""But I am sure there is"

"others, more sensible, found in the teacher a man who composed for them"
an excellent and convincing report for the Corporation.  In this report
the refusal of the street's inhabitants to comply with the resolution
of the Corporation was so well explained that the Corporation actually

remains the random search group. Therein lies the eight-oughts-one

"Viggon snorted. ""I call ten to the minus ten chances rather hopeless."
"But go on, Linus."""
"""The other has a sixty-forty chance,"" he said. ""If the infrawave"
detector locates the space rift that lies along our coordinate three

say this because space rifts tend to produce strong responses in any
of the primitive detecting gear. They've certainly been busy running
"down space warps, which indicates that they've been getting a lot"
"of spurious responses."" He smiled. ""If space were entirely clear of"
"foreign matter and space rifts, they'd find their new detector vaguely"
"inefficient. I--"""
Viggon waved a hand to indicate he had heard enough.

Next morning they had gone.
"Yes, indeed, they left at four in the morning, at dawn; I heard them"
"perfectly well, for my room was near the stairs. The knight of the plump"
"thighs came first, clumping heavily down the stairs. She hushed him, and"
her voice sounded angry.
"Eilert had just risen too, and they stood outside for some minutes,"
"negotiating with him for the boat--yes, at once; they had changed their"
"minds and wanted to leave, immediately. Then they went down to the boat,"
"Eilert with them. I could see them through the window, chilled by the cold"
of early morning and short-tempered with each other. There had been a
"frost during the night; ice lay on the water in the buckets, and the"
"ground was harsh to walk on. Poor things--no food, no coffee; a windy"
"morning, with the sea still running rather high. There they go with their"
knapsacks on their backs; she is still wearing her red hat.
"Well, it was no concern of mine, and I lay down again, intending to sleep"
"till about noon. Nothing was any concern of mine, except myself. I could"
"not see the boat from my bed, so I got up again--just to while the time"
"away--to see how far they had gone. Not very far, though both men were"
"distinctly, though at that time, my poor friend, you were not a little"
"portly, and now you are a man shrunken."""
"""And my name?"" he asked, flattered that a beautiful woman should recall"
him so distinctly.
"""It is a strange name--Gatepath. An old English name redolent of the"
soil. Roger Gatepath. Your firm bears no prefix of initials and no
"suffix of company. You call yourselves Gatepaths. Just Gatepaths, as"
"though your status were territorial."""
"He crowed with pleasure. By an exercise in memory, Madame Gilbert had"
tied him to her chariot wheels.
"""Right!"" cried he. ""Right in every particular. You are the most"
"wonderful of women. For two minutes I spoke with you, and that was"
"nearly four years ago. I was one of a large party, an insignificant"
"lawyer lost in a dazzling company of titles. Yet you have remembered."""
Madame left the sense of flattery to soak in. She did not spoil the
impression that she had made by explaining that she would have
remembered a lackey with just the same accuracy.
"""And you, Madame?"" he asked. ""Have you been all these years doing war"
work with the Italian Red Cross? The years have passed and left no mark
"upon your face and figure. I, who comfortably filled out my clothes, am"
"shrunken, yet time and sorrow have spared you."""
"""Nevertheless, I have been pretty hard at work,"" said Madame briskly. ""I"
was present at that party ostensibly as an official of the Italian Red
Cross. In fact I was there to see that no harm befell the Royal
Personages who were in my charge. While we moved about those pleasant

"""You told me that you loved me, Gerald,"" she said in a deep voice,"
"suddenly grown calm.  ""You swore by all you held most sacred that I was"
"all the world to you, and that no one should come between us.  Yet past"
events have shown that you have forgotten those words of yours on the
"day when we idled in the Bois beneath the trees.  You, too, remember"
"that day, do you not--the day when our lips met for the first time, and"
"we both believed our path would in future be strewn with flowers?  Ah!"""
"she sighed, ""and what an awakening life has been to me since then!"""
"""We parted because of your refusal to satisfy me as to the real state of"
"your feelings towards the man who was my enemy,"" I said rather warmly."
"""But was it justifiable?"" she asked in a tone of deep reproach and"
mingled sweetness.  Her blue eyes looked full upon me--those eyes that
"had held me in such fascination in the golden days of youth.  ""Has any"
single fact which you have since discovered verified your suspicions?
"Tell me truthfully;"" and she leaned towards me in an attitude of deepest"
earnestness.
"""No,"" I answered honestly, ""I cannot say that my suspicions have ever"
"been verified."""
"""And because of that you have returned to me when it is too late."""
"""Too late!""  I cried.  ""What do you mean?"""
"""Exactly what I have said.  You have come back to me when it is too"

"“Came in here an’ got some grub a full hour ago,” that servitor"
explained briefly. “When he’d eat it he went off agin.”
“Didn’t he say where he was going?” Bainbridge asked.
The cook shook his head. “Nary word.”
“And you didn’t happen to see what direction he took?”
"“Nary a sight,” was the reply. “I was busy inside.”"
"Bob frowned for a second, and then shrugged his shoulders. After all,"
"what did it matter where the fellow had gone, so long as he had taken"
himself away? It was very natural for him to avoid the man who had so
"humiliated him, though it was rather puzzling to have him slip away"
without apparently encountering any one.
"Bob proceeded to give his orders to the cook, explaining that he would"
have to pull up stakes at once and start down the river.
"“The boys will be a long way from here by nightfall,” he said, “so"
you’ll have to hustle. I’ve saved out a couple of men to help you and
"the cookee, who’ll be under your orders till you pitch camp to-night.”"
Outside the mess tent he hesitated an instant. Then he entered the other
"tent. This time he did not pause by the door, but crossed hastily to the"
"farther corner, where there was a small space crudely partitioned off"
"from the main portion. This would be Schaeffer’s sanctum, of course, and"
Bob entered it curiously--only to stop with an exclamation of mingled
"surprise, anger, and chagrin."
The place was in the utmost disorder. Blankets were rolled up in a ball

all objects.
"“This way of living that you speak of,” she said, “sounds so futile and"
purposeless. Haven’t you any work to do in the world that might
interest you more?”
"“My dear Miss Marian,” he exclaimed—“work! Think of dressing every day"
"for dinner, of making half a dozen calls in an afternoon—with a"
policeman at every corner ready to jump into your auto and take you to
"the station, if you get up any greater speed than a donkey cart’s gait."
We do-nothings are the hardest workers in the land.”
"The dinner was concluded, the waiter generously fed, and the two walked"
out to the corner where they had met. Miss Marian walked very well now;
her limp was scarcely noticeable.
"“Thank you for a nice time,” she said, frankly. “I must run home now. I"
"liked the dinner very much, Mr. Chandler.”"
"He shook hands with her, smiling cordially, and said something about a"
"game of bridge at his club. He watched her for a moment, walking rather"
"rapidly eastward, and then he found a cab to drive him slowly homeward."
In his chilly bedroom Chandler laid away his evening clothes for a
sixty-nine days’ rest. He went about it thoughtfully.
"“That was a stunning girl,” he said to himself. “She’s all right, too,"
"I’d be sworn, even if she does have to work. Perhaps if I’d told her"
"the truth instead of all that razzle-dazzle we might—but, confound it!"
I had to play up to my clothes.”

"""You deserve to win, Boyd; you have made a good fight."""

"""Nothing serious, I am sure. You see, they wanted me, and nobody else;"
once they find they have the wrong man I rather believe they will free
"him in disgust."""
"A moment later he went on: ""Just the same, it makes me feel depressed"
and guilty to leave him--I--I wouldn't desert a comrade for anything if
"the choice lay with me."""
"""You did quite right,"" Cherry warmly assured him."
"""You see, I am not working for myself; I am doing this for another."""
"It was the girl's turn to sigh softly, while the eyes she turned toward"
the west were strangely sad and dreamy. To her companion she seemed not
at all like the buoyant creature who had kindled his courage when it
"was so low, the brave girl who had stood so steadfastly at his shoulder"
"and kept his hopes alive during these last, trying weeks. It struck him"
suddenly that she had grown very quiet of late. It was the first time
"he had had the leisure to notice it, but now, when he came to reflect"
"on it, he remembered that she had never seemed quite the same since his"
interview with her on that day when Hilliard had so unexpectedly come
to his rescue. He wondered if in reality this change might not be due
to some reflected alteration in himself. Well! He could not help it.
so damned easy?”
"“Tell us why you say that, Stellamaris,” said Herold."
"John rose suddenly and stood by the west window, which was closed."
Stella's high bed had been drawn next to the window open to the south.
"The room was warm, for a great fire blazed in the tall chimneypiece. He"
"rose to hide his eyes from Stella, confounding Herold for a marplot. Was"
this the way to make his task easier? He heard Stella say in her sweet
contralto:
“Do you imagine it 's just for silly foolishness I call you Great High
"Belovedest and Great High Favourite? You see, Walter dear, I gave John"
"his title before I knew you, so I had to make some difference in yours."
"But they mean everything to me. I live in the sky such a lot, and it's"
a beautiful life; but I know there 's another life in the great world--a
"beautiful life, too.” She wrinkled her forehead. “Oh, it 's so difficult"
"to explain! It's so hard to talk about feelings, because the moment you"
"begin to talk about them, the feelings become so vague. It's like trying"
to tell any one the shape of a sunset.” She paused for a moment or two;
Herold smiled at her and nodded encouragingly. Presently she went on:
"“I 'll try to put it this way. Often a gull, you see, comes hovering"
"outside here and looks in at me, oh, for a long time, with his round,"
"yellow eyes; and my heart beats, and I love him, for he tells me all"
"about the sea and sky and clouds, where I'll never go,--not really,--and"
"I live the sky life through him, and more than ever since you sent me"
that poem--I know it by heart--about the sea-gull. Who wrote it?”
"“Swinburne,” said Herold."
“Did he write anything else?”
"“I see what you mean,” said he."
"“I should hope so,” said Herold."
"He looked at his watch and jumped to his feet. “Star of the Sea,” said"
"he, “to talk with you is the most fascinating occupation on earth; but"
"managers are desperate fellows, and I 'll get into boiling water if I"
miss my rehearsal.” He turned to John. “I don't see how you are going to
catch this train.”
"“Neither do I,” said John. “I shall go by the one after.”"
"Herold took his leave, promising to run down for the week-end. Constable"
"accompanied him to the door in a dignified way, and this ceremony of"
"politeness accomplished, stalked back to the hearth-rug, where he threw"
"himself down, his head on his paws, and his faithful eyes fixed on his"
mistress. John sat down again by the bedside. There was a short silence
during which Stellamaris smiled at him and he smiled at Stellamaris.
“Does n't the Great High Belovedest want to smoke?”
"“Badly,” said John."
She held out her hand for the pipe and tobacco-pouch. He gave them to
"her, and she filled the pipe. For a while he smoked peacefully. From"
where he sat all he could see of the outside world was the waste of
sun-kissed waters stretching away and melting into a band of pearly
cloud on the horizon. He might have been out at sea. Possibly this time
"next week he would be, and the salt air would be playing, as now, about"
his head. But on board that ship would be no spacious sea-chamber like
"this, so gracious in its appointments--its old oak and silver, its"
"bright chintzes, its quiet old engravings, its dainty dressing-table"
Three months--and in this state of misery!
"""I think I shall do something desperate.  Now that I can't dance, and"
"THEY know, it's too awful!  If I could see him, I wouldn't mind anything."
"But I know--I know he'll never want me again.  Oh, Mrs. Fiorsen, I wish I"
"was dead!  I do!"""
"A heavy sigh escaped Gyp, and, bending suddenly, she kissed the girl's"
"forehead.  Still that scent of orange blossom about her skin or hair, as"
"when she asked whether she ought to love or not; as when she came,"
"moth-like, from the tree-shade into the moonlight, spun, and fluttered,"
"with her shadow spinning and fluttering before her.  Gyp turned away,"
"feeling that she must relieve the strain and pointing to the bowl, said:"
"""YOU put that there, I'm sure.  It's beautiful."""
"The girl answered, with piteous eagerness:"
"""Oh, would you like it?  Do take it.  Count Rosek gave it me.""  She"
"started away from the door.  ""Oh, that's papa.  He'll be coming in!"""
"Gyp heard a man clear his throat, and the rattle of an umbrella falling"
into a stand; the sight of the girl wilting and shrinking against the
"sideboard steadied her.  Then the door opened, and Mr. Wagge entered."
"Short and thick, in black frock coat and trousers, and a greyish beard,"
"he stared from one to the other.  He looked what he was, an Englishman"
"and a chapelgoer, nourished on sherry and mutton, who could and did make"
"his own way in the world.  His features, coloured, as from a deep"
"liverishness, were thick, like his body, and not ill-natured, except for"
"a sort of anger in his small, rather piggy grey eyes.  He said in a voice"
"permanently gruff, but impregnated with a species of professional"
ingratiation:
clover; and that was the reason he had the second sight. He could see
"those who are invisible, but they could not see him."
"And as he was sitting there in the forward cabin, he heard voices"
"within the ship. He peered through a crack, and there were three"
"coal-black crows sitting inside the deck-beams, and they were talking"
"about their husbands. All three were tired of them, and were planning"
"their death. One could see at once that they were witches, who had"
assumed another form.
"""But is it certain that there is no one here who can overhear us?"" said"
one of the crows. And by the way she spoke the cabin-boy knew her for
the captain's wife.
"""No, you can see there's not,"" said the others, the wives of the first"
"and second quartermasters. ""There is not a soul aboard."""
"""Well, then I do not mind saying that I know of a good way to get rid of"
"them,"" said the captain's wife once more, and hopped closer to the two"
"others. ""We will turn ourselves into breakers, wash them into the sea,"
"and sink the ship with every man on board."""
"That pleased the others, and they sat there a long time discussing the"
"day and the fairway. ""But is it certain that no one can overhear us?"""
once more asked the captain's wife.
"""You know that such is the case,"" said the two others."
"""Well, there is a counter-spell for what we wish to do, and if it is"
"used, it will go hard with us, for it will cost us nothing less than our"
"lives!"""
she 'll have to earn her living as a little slave in some squalid
Household. But what's going to become of that human creature morally and
spiritually? That's what I want to know.”
"“It's an interesting problem,” said Herold. “She may be either a"
"benumbed half-idiot or a vicious, vindictive she-brute.”"
"“Just so,” said John. “That is, if she goes to slave in some squalid"
household. But suppose she were transferred to different surroundings
"altogether? Suppose she had ease of life, loving care, and all the rest"
of it?”
The senile travesty of Herold laughed.
“You want me to say that she may develop into some sort of flower of
womanhood.”
"“Do you think she might?” John asked seriously. “My dear fellow,” said"
"Herold, “there are Heaven knows how many hundred million human beings"
"on the face of the earth, and every one of them is different from the"
others. How can one tell what any particular young woman whom one does
n't know might or might not do in given circumstances? But if you want
me to say whether I think it right for you to step in and look after the
"poor little devil's future, then I do say it's right. It 's stunning of"
you. It's the very best thing you can do. It will give the poor little
"wretch a chance, at any rate, and will give you something outside"
yourself to think of.”
"“I was going to do it whether you thought it right or not,” said Risca."
"Herold laughed again. “For a great, hulking bull of a man you 're"
"sometimes very feminine, John.”"
"""Forty-one and Forty-five,"" he corrected her courteously, still staring"
"fiercely at me. ""I looked it up. Of the Anita Mason Law, Emergency"

in the wind.

"""Bernardo Sarriano and the Pisan galleys,"" he turned to Francesco."
"""They are heading for the Cape of Circé."""
A shout of command rang through the woods.
As with phantom cohorts the forest-aisles teemed with moving shadows.
A ride of some five miles lay between them and the Cape of Circé. Much
of that region was wild forest land and moor; bleak rocky wastes let
"into woods and gloom. Great oaks, gnarled, vast, terrible, held giant"
sway amid the huddled masses of the underbrush. Here the wild boar
lurked and the wolf hunted. But for the most it was dark and
"calamitous, a ghostly wilderness forsaken by man."
As they rode along they struck the occasional trail of the Crusaders
"of the Church. A burnt hamlet, a smoking farmhouse with a dun mist"
"hanging over it like a shroud, and once they stumbled upon the body of"
a dead girl. They halted for a brief space to give her burial. The
duke's men dug a shallow grave under an oak and they left her there
and went on their way with greater caution.

nasty about the length of his hair; and _imagine_!--he not only
"resisted arrest, resulting in three hospitalized policemen, but he"
sassed the judge in open court!
"""Told me a man wasn't supposed to say anything except through female"
"attorneys. Told _her_ that where _I_ came from, a man spoke his piece"
"when he'd a mind to, and his woman walked by his side."""
"""What happened?"" I asked breathlessly."
"""Oh, Guilty of This and Contempt of That. That blown-up brinosaur took"
"my last munit for fines, then explained that she was remitting the"
"rest because I was a foreigner and uneducated."" His eyes grew dark for"
"a moment. He chuckled again. ""But I wasn't going to serve all those"
"fancy little prison sentences. Forcible Citizenship Indoctrination,"
"they call it? Shook the dead-dry dust of the misbegotten, God forsaken"
mother world from my feet forever. The women on it deserve their men.
"My pockets were folded from the fines, and the paddlefeet were looking"
"for me so close I didn't dare radio for more munit. So I stowed away."""
*       *       *       *       *
"For a moment, I didn't understand him. When I did, I was almost ill."
"""Y-you mean,"" I choked, ""th-that you're b-breaking the law right now?"
"And I'm with you while you're doing it?"""
He leaned over the edge of the bunk and stared at me very seriously.
"""What breed of tadpole are they turning out these days? Besides, what"
"business do _you_ have this close to the hull?"""
"Silence, intense, sardonic silence had intervened. The three looked at"
one another and made a sour joke about Mandas. Then the black-cap turned
to me.
"""Can you understand Sardinian?"" he said."
"""Somewhat. More than Sicilian, anyhow."""
"""But Sardinian is more difficult than Sicilian. It is full of words"
"utterly unknown to Italian--"""
"""Yes, but,"" say I, ""it is spoken openly, in plain words, and Sicilian is"
"spoken all stuck together, none of the words there at all."""
He looks at me as if I were an imposter. Yet it is true. I find it quite
"easy to understand Sardinian. As a matter of fact, it is more a question"
of human approach than of sound. Sardinian seems open and manly and
"downright. Sicilian is gluey and evasive, as if the Sicilian didn't want"
"to speak straight to you. As a matter of fact, he doesn't. He is an"
"over-cultured, sensitive, ancient soul, and he has so many sides to his"
mind that he hasn't got any definite one mind at all. He's got a dozen
"minds, and uneasily he's aware of it, and to commit himself to anyone of"
them is merely playing a trick on himself and his interlocutor. The
"Sardinian, on the other hand, still seems to have one downright mind. I"
"bump up against a downright, smack-out belief in Socialism, for"
example. The Sicilian is much too old in our culture to swallow
Socialism whole: much too ancient and rusé not to be sophisticated about
any and every belief. He'll go off like a squib: and then he'll smoulder
acridly and sceptically even against his own fire. One sympathizes with
him in retrospect. But in daily life it is unbearable.
"""Where do you find such white bread?"" say I to the black cap, because he"
"What a coincidence: another barn on my road, just as in the days of the"
golden horn! It offers me plenty of straw and shelter for the night; but
"where is the girl who gave me the letter? How warm her breath was, coming"
"between lips a little parted! She will come again, of course; let us wait,"
"we have plenty of time, another twenty years--oh, yes, she will come...."
I must be on my guard against such traps. I have entered upon the
honorable years; I am weak and quite capable of believing that a barn is a
"gift from above: thou well-deserving old man, here is a barn for thee!"
"No, thank you, I'm only just in my seventies."
And so in my errand of the head I pass by the barn.
Toward morning I find shelter under a projecting crag. It is fitting that
"I should live under crags hereafter, and I lie down in a huddle, small and"
"invisible. Anything else you please, as long as you don't flaunt your"
selfishness and your rags!
"I am comfortable now, lying with my head on another person's knapsack full"
of used clothes; I am doing this solely because it is just the right size.
But sleep will not come; there are only thoughts and dreams and lines of
"poetry and sentimentality. The sack smells human, and I fling it away,"
laying my head on my arm. My arm smells of wood--not even wood.
But the slip of paper with the address--have I got the address? And I
scratch a match to read it through and know it by heart tomorrow. Just a
"line in pencil, nothing; but perhaps there is a softness in the letters, a"
womanliness--I don't know.
It doesn't matter.
"captors waiting. With their shoulders bunched for abrupt action, and"
"their guns in hand, the two men walked to the trap-door of the ship."
"They threw the heavy bolts, drew a deep breath--and flung open the"
door to charge unexpectedly toward the thickest mass of creatures that
surrounded the ship!
*       *       *       *       *
In a measure their charge was successful. Its very suddenness caught
some of the tall monstrosities off guard. Half a dozen of them stopped
the fragile glass bullets to writhe in horrible death on the red metal
paving of the square. But that didn't last long.
"In less than a minute, thin, clammy arms were winding around the"
"Earthmen's wrists, and their guns were wrenched from them. And then"
started a hand-to-hand encounter that was all the more hideous for
being so unlike any fighting that might have occurred on Earth.
"With a furious growl Dex charged the nearest creature, whose huge"
round head swayed on its stalk of a body fully six feet above his own
"head. He gathered the long thin legs in a football grip, and sent the"
thing crashing full length on its back. The great head thumped
"resoundingly against the metal paving, and the creature lay"
motionless.
"For an instant Dex could only stare at the thing. It had been so easy,"
"like overcoming a child. But even as that thought crossed his mind,"
two of the tall thin figures closed in behind him. Four pairs of arms
"wound around him, feebly but tenaciously, like wet seaweed."
"They began to constrict and wind tighter around him. He tore at them,"
dislodged all but two. His sturdy Earth leg went back to sweep the
"shove in a dash of what he would prescribe, night and morning.  Perfect"
"quiet.  No stimulant.  A little cup of strong coffee without milk, if he"
seemed low.  Keep him in bed at present.  No worry; no excitement. Young
"man still.  Plenty of vitality.  As to herself, no undue anxiety."
To-morrow they would see whether a night nurse would be necessary.  Above
"all, no violin for a month, no alcohol--in every way the strictest"
"moderation!  And with a last and friendliest wink, leaning heavily on"
"that word ""moderation,"" he took out a stylographic pen, scratched on a"
"leaf of his note-book, shook Gyp's hand, smiled whimsically, buttoned his"
"upper waistcoat, and departed."
Gyp went back to her seat by the bed.  Irony!  She whose only desire was
"to be let go free, was mainly responsible for his breakdown!  But for"
"her, there would be nothing on his mind, for he would not be married!"
"Brooding morbidly, she asked herself--his drinking, debts, even the"
"girl--had she caused them, too?  And when she tried to free him and"
herself--this was the result!  Was there something fatal about her that
must destroy the men she had to do with?  She had made her father
"unhappy, Monsieur Harmost--Rosek, and her husband!  Even before she"
"married, how many had tried for her love, and gone away unhappy!  And,"
"getting up, she went to a mirror and looked at herself long and sadly."
XX
"Three days after her abortive attempt to break away, Gyp, with much"
"heart-searching, wrote to Daphne Wing, telling her of Fiorsen's illness,"
"and mentioning a cottage near Mildenham, where--if she liked to go--she"
"would be quite comfortable and safe from all curiosity, and finally"
begging to be allowed to make good the losses from any broken
"closed their lids. He sat with his head sunk on his breast, till the"
tumult died away. No one rose. The Speaker looked round once and again.
Could it be that no one----? Slowly he began to rise. The movement
"caught Sir Robert's attention: he signed to Puttock, who sprang heavily"
"to his feet. Puttock was no favourite as a speaker, and generally his"
rising was a signal for the House to thin. He began his speech with his
stolid deliberation. Not a man stirred. They waited for something still.
"""And now,"" whispered Medland to the Treasurer, who sat by him, ""let's"
"see what it was in that infernal paper."""
The Treasurer handed him what he asked.
"""You ought to see it,"" he whispered back."
"Mr. Puttock's voice droned on, and his sheaf of notes rustled in his"
hand. No one looked at him or listened to him. Their eyes were still on
"Medland. The Premier read--it seemed so slowly--put the paper down, and"
"gazed first up at the ceiling; then he glanced round, and found all the"
"attentive eyes on him: he smiled--it was just a visible smile, no"
"more--and his head fell again on his breast, while his hand idly twisted"
a button on his coat.
"The show was over, or had never come, and the deferred rush to the doors"
began. They almost tumbled over one another now in their haste to reach
"where their tongues could play freely. Kilshaw and Perry, the Treasurer"
"and the waverers, all slipped out, and Norburn, knowing nothing but"
"simply wearied of Puttock, followed them. Scarce twenty were left in the"
"House, and the galleries had poured half their contents into the great"
room which served for a lobby outside. There the talk ran swift and
"eager. The very name of ""Benyon"" was enough for many, who remembered"
that it had always been said to be the maiden name of Medland's wife.
a prolonged war.
But the immediate reality became too overwhelming. Grey multitudes were
"sweeping khaki multitudes before them. High-explosives, shrapnel,"
"grenades, bombs, bullets were rending, piercing, and shattering the"
living flesh and muscle and bone. Towns and villages were being turned
"into heaps of brick and wreckage. Hordes of old men, women, and children"
"were thronging the roads, and fleeing from approaching disaster."
"We went to work as usual although we worked less than usual, for we now"
had something to talk about. Would the Germans reach the coast? If they
"did, then the northern armies would be cut off and destroyed. A general"
retreat from our front might be ordered at any moment. We stood in
groups and discussed these problems hour by hour.
One day we were returning from work and passing through the village. A
"crowd of civilians was standing round the window of the Mairie, where a"
"written notice was exposed. An old woman dressed in black was moaning,"
"""Mon Dieu, mon Dieu, mon Dieu."" The '19, '20, and '21 classes had been"
called up.
Then the German advance came to an end. A French army had arrived and
saved the situation. The shelling of the back areas had ceased. The
danger was over for a time.
Had the Germans assembled all their strength for one supreme attempt at
breaking through the Western Front? Or was it only the beginning of a
whole series of operations?
"One morning, as we woke up, we heard the roar and rumble of a"
"bombardment. We did not take much notice of it, for we had heard the"
sound so often.
"as all besieged cities are, of rumours of spies and treachery, and of"
"reported overtures made now to the city behind the back of the army,"
"and now to the army to betray the city. A single word of denunciation,"
and Tzerclas' life would not be worth three minutes' purchase--a rope
and the nearest butcher's hook would end it. My mind was made up to
say the word.
I suppose I had been going about in this state of vigilance three days
"or more, when something, but not the thing I sought, rewarded it. At"
the time I was on my way back from morning drill. It was a little
"after eight, and the streets and the people wore an air bright, yet"
"haggard. Night, with its perils, was over; day, with its privations,"
"lay before us. My mind was on the common fortunes, but I suppose my"
"eyes were mechanically doing their work, for on a sudden I saw"
"something at a window, took perhaps half a step, and stopped as if I"
had been shot.
"I had seen Marie's face! Nay, I still saw it, while a man might count"
two. Then it was gone. And I stood gasping.
"I suppose I stood so for half a minute, waiting, with the blood racing"
"from my heart to my head, and every pulse in my body beating. But she"
did not reappear. The door of the house did not open. Nothing
happened.
Yet I had certainly seen her; for I remembered particulars--the
"expression of her face, the surprise that had leapt into her eyes as"
"they met mine, the opening of the lips in an exclamation."
And still I stood gazing at the window and nothing happened.
"At last I came to myself, and I scanned the house. It was a large"
"Geraldine, honour me by accepting my escort.—Grey, will you join us?"""
"He spoke the last words over his shoulder, and there was a note in his"
"voice which the young man had never heard before, and which he did not"
"fully understand.  It seemed to sting him, but he knew not why."
"""I thank you—no,"" he answered.  ""I am going home."""
And then he stood quite still to watch Lord Sandford lead away the fair
"Geraldine, who threw him one strange, half-appealing glance over her"
"shoulder, but spoke no word of farewell."
"Grey had meant to go home, but somehow he could not bring himself to do"
"so.  His brain seemed on fire, and his heart with it.  He knew not what"
"ailed him, but a fever was consuming him.  He left the gardens, but"
"walked on and on, not knowing or caring whither he went.  The night was"
"far spent, and the dawn was beginning to blush in the eastern sky,"
before he found himself in the region of Sandford House again.
The place was still and deserted.  The revellers and roisterers seemed
"all at home.  A watchman dozed at his post, thankful for the peace of"
"the streets, and Grey met no interruption, till suddenly, round a"
"corner, he came face to face with his host, who gave him a look, uttered"
"a short laugh, and linked his arm within his."
"""Well met, friend Grey!  You too have had no desire to woo the somnolent"
"god?  We find metal more attractive elsewhere.  Say now, what think you"
of the future Lady Sandford?  Methought you had eyes but for her
to-night.  Will she not queen it right royally here—the beautiful
"stately creature? You have taste, Grey, and I am well pleased that you"
"have.  Those painted, patched, and powdered Jezebels, smirking and"
"ogling and running all over the town for the adulation of the crowd, are"
gone long barefoot. The marks of a child either stolen for ransom or run
away from home owing to some wild strain in the blood were too obvious
to be mistaken. Her liberty of movement among the gipsies made the
latter supposition the more probable.
"""I am _not_ pretty Chica, and I am not little,"" she cried angrily. ""I"
"would have you remember, Pépe, that _I_ made this plan, which the folk"
of Egypt are to execute to-night. But since this is the great brigand
"Don José of Ronda, who was executed at Salamanca, I will tell him all"
"about it."""
She looked round at the dark faces with which they were surrounded.
"""There are new folk among these,"" she said, ""men I do not know. Bid them"
"go away. Else I will not speak of myself, and I have much to say to Don"
"José!"""
"Pépe of the Eleven Wounds looked about him, and shook his head. Gipsydom"
"is a commonwealth when it comes to a venture like this, and save in the"
"presence of some undoubted leader, all Egypt has an equal right to hear"
and to speak. Pépe's authority was not sufficient for this thing. But
that of the Sergeant was.
"He lifted his Montera cap and said, ""I would converse a while with this"
maid on the affairs of Egypt. 'Tis doubtless no more than you know
"already, and then, having heard her story my advice is at your service."
"But she will not speak with so many ears about. It is a woman's whim,"
"and such the wisest of us must sometimes humour."""
The gipsies smiled at the gay wave of his hand with which Cardono
uttered this truism and quickly betook themselves out of earshot in
"groups of ten and a dozen. Cards were produced, and in a few minutes"
"Jessica held the casket to Severance, with a little outward sweep of her"
"wrist. He took it and, folding his arms, looked at her steadily. A tide"
"of angry colour rose to her hair, then she turned her back upon him and"
looking out over the water tapped her foot on the rocks.
“Why do you not go?” she asked. “I hate you more than any one on earth.”
“No. You love me.”
"“I hate you! You are a brute! The coolest, the rudest, the most"
exasperating man on—on earth.”
"“That is the reason you love me. My dear Mrs. Pendleton,” he continued,"
"taking the ring from the casket and laying the latter on a rock, “a"
woman of brains and headstrong will—but unegoistic—likes a brutal and
"masterful man. An egoistical woman, whether she be fool or brilliant,"
"likes a slave. The reason is that egoism, not being a feminine quality"
"primarily, but borrowed from man, places its fair possessor outside of"
her sex’s limitations and supplies her with the satisfying simulacrum of
those stronger characteristics which she would otherwise look for in
man. You are not an egoist.”
He took her hand and removed her glove in spite of her resistance.
“Don’t struggle. You would only look ridiculous if any one should pass.
"Besides, it is useless. I am so much stronger. I do not know or care"
what really possessed you to indulge in such a freak as to engage
"yourself to four men at once,” he continued, slipping the ring on her"
"finger. “You had your joke, and I hope you enjoyed it. The dénouement"
"was highly dramatic. As I said, I desire no explanation, for I am never"
concerned with anything but results. And now—you are going to marry
me.”
"""The law is on my side...  I can even demand two thousand.  I can"
insist on your pulling down the building ... and enforce it too.  That
"is why my claim is so small. I demand that you should pull it down!"""
"""Very well.  Probably we shall do so ... after three years, and after"
"having dragged you into enormous law expenses.  And then, having paid"
"up, we shall open our public-house and you will be ruined ..."
annihilated like the Swedes at Poltava.  We shall see that you are
ruined ... we will take good care of that.  We could have begun to
"arrange about a public-house now, but you see our time is valuable, and"
besides we are sorry for you.  Why should we take the bread out of your
"mouth without any reason?"""
"Egor Terentievitch looked at his guest, clenching his teeth, and felt"
"that he was master of the situation, and held his fate in his hands."
"Vaviloff was full of pity for himself at having to deal with this calm,"
cruel figure in the checked suit.
"""And being such a near neighbour you might have gained a good deal by"
"helping us, and we should have remembered it too.  Even now, for"
"instance, I should advise you to open a small shop for tobacco, you"
"know, bread, cucumbers, and so on...  All these are sure to be in great"
"demand."""
"Vaviloff listened, and being a clever man, knew that to throw himself"
upon the enemy's generosity was the better plan.  It was as well to
"begin from the beginning, and, not knowing what else to do to relieve"
"his mind, the soldier began to swear at Kuvalda."
"""Curses be upon your head, you drunken rascal!  May the Devil take you!"""
"""Do you mean the lawyer who composed your petition?"" asked Petunikoff,"
"“Ah, yes. That 's why I wrote to you yesterday, dear.”"
"She had written to him, in fact, every month for many years, long,"
foolish letters in which everything was futile save the genuine
"affection underlying them, and more often than not John had taken"
them as read and pitched them into the waste-paper basket. His few
"perfunctory replies, however, had been treasured and neatly docketed and"
"pigeon-holed in the bureau in her bedroom, together with the rest of her"
family archives and other precious documents. Among them was a famous
recipe for taking mulberry stains out of satin. That she prized
inordinately.
"“I should n't like to drift apart from dear Ellen's boy,” she said with"
a smile.
"“And I should n't like to lose touch with you, my dear aunt,” said John,"
with more graciousness. “And that is why I've come to see you to-day.
I've had rather a bad time lately.”
“I know--that awful case in the papers.” She shivered. “Don't let us
talk of it. You must try to forget it. I wrote to you how shocked I was.
"I asked you to come and stay with me, and said I would do what I could"
"to comfort you. I believe in the ties of kinship, my dear, and I did n't"
like to think of you bearing your trouble alone.”
"“That was very kind indeed of you,” said John, who had missed the"
invitation hidden away in the wilderness of the hastily scanned
"sixteen-page letter. He flushed beneath his dark skin, aware of"
"rudeness. After all, when a lady invites you to her house, it is boorish"
to ignore the offered hospitality. It is a slight for which one can
scarcely apologize. But she evidently bore him no malice.
"office itself, with its glass doors, its counter, and its long desk, at"
the farther end of which a bill-clerk was poring over his task.
Iron-barred windows at the front of the room looked out upon the
street; other windows and a door at the right opened upon the driveway
"and railroad track, while at the rear the glass-panelled door through"
"which they had just been peering gave egress only to the dock itself,"
up which the two officers were likely to come at any instant. Even as
"Emerson, with a last desperate glance, summed up the possible places of"
"concealment, Fraser exclaimed, softly:"
"""There they are now!"" and they saw at the foot of the gang-plank two"
men talking with Big George. They saw Balt point the strangers
"carelessly to the office, whence he had seen Boyd disappearing a few"
"moments before, and turn back to his stevedores; then they saw the"
plain-clothes men approaching.
"""Here! Gimme your coat and hat, quick!"" cried Fraser in a low voice,"
"his eyes blazing at a sudden, thought. He stripped his own garments"
"from his back with feverish haste. ""Put mine on. There! I'll stall for"
"you. When they grab me, take it on the run. Understand!"""
"""That won't do. Everybody knows me."" Boyd cast an apprehensive glance"
"at the arched back of the bill-clerk, but Fraser, quick of resource in"
"such a situation, forced him swiftly to make the change, saying:"
"""Nix. It's your only 'out.' Stand here, see!"" He indicated a position"
"beside the rear door. ""I'll step out the other way where they can see"
"me,"" he continued, pointing to the wagon-way at the right. ""Savvy? When"
"they grab me, you beat it, and don't wait for nothing."""
"""But you--"""
"who considers himself duped, in his countenance. It had gone ill with La"
Giralda if she had not been able to prove her case. But she held
"something in her hand, the sight of which brought the butcher of Tortosa"
down from his saddle as quickly as if a Cristino bullet had pierced him
to the heart.
"La Giralda was holding out to him an old string of beads, simply carved"
"out of some brown oriental nut, but so worn away by use that the"
stringing had almost cut through the hard and polished shell.
"""My mother's rosary!"" he cried, and sinking on his knees, he devoutly"
received and kissed it. He abode thus a moment looking up to the
"sky--he, the man who had waded in blood during six years of bitter"
warfare. He kissed the worn beads one by one and wept. They were his
mother's way to heaven. And he did not know a better. In which perchance
he was right.
"""Whence gat you this?"" cried Cabrera, rising sharply as a thought struck"
"him; ""my mother never would have parted with these in her life--you"
"plundered it from her body after her death! Quick, out with your story,"
"or you die!"""
"""Nay, little foster-son,"" said La Giralda, ""I was indeed with your"
"mother at the last--when she was shot by Nogueras, and five minutes"
before she died she gave her rosary into my hands to convey to you.
"'Take this to my son,' she said, 'and bid him never forget his mother,"
nor to say his prayers night and morn. Bid him swear it on these sacred
beads!' So I have brought them to you. She kissed them before she died.
"At the risk of my life have I brought it."""
"""And these,"" said Cabrera--""do you know these dogs, La Giralda?"""
"gumming up their dope. Well, it's about time to plug in on E2. Here's"
"where the fireworks start!"" He closed the connections which transferred"
the central portion of the upper lookout screen to a small micrometer
screen at Breckenridge's desk and plugged it into the first
"check-station. Instantly a point of red light, surrounded by a vivid"
"orange circle, appeared upon the screen, low down and to the left of"
"center, and the timing galvanometer showed a wide positive deflection."
"""Hashed again!"" growled Breckenridge. ""I must be losing my grip,"
"I guess. I put everything I had on that sight, and missed it ten"
divisions. I think I'll turn in my badge--I've cocked our perfect curve
"already, before we got to the first check-station!"" His hands moved"
"toward the controls, to correct their course and acceleration."
"""As you were--hold everything! Lay off those controls!"" snapped the"
"computer. ""There's something screwy, just as I thought--and it isn't"
"you, either. I'm no pilot, of course, but I do know good compensation"
"when I see it, and if you weren't compensating that point I never saw it"
"done. Besides, with your skill and my figures I know darn well that we"
aren't off more than a tenth of one division. He's cuckoo! Don't call
"him--let him start it, and refer him to me."""
"""All x--I'll be only too glad to pass the buck. But I still think,"
"Steve, that you're playing with dynamite. Who ever heard of an"
"astronomer being wrong?"""
"""You'd be surprised,"" grinned the physicist, ""Since this fuss has"
"just started, nobody has tried to find out whether they were wrong"
"or not...."""
"""IPV _Arcturus_, attention!"" came from the speaker curtly."
He saw not the rival queens of beauty in their gorgeous apparel.  He saw
"not the surging crowd that eddied around them, appraising, flattering,"
"admiring, laughing.  He only saw one white figure, standing aloof and"
"for the moment alone, the moonbeams glimmering upon the shining"
"whiteness of her dress, the fair face bent, as though in some sort of"
"sorrow or shame.  He saw it, and he was instantly at her side."
"Whether or not he spoke, he knew not.  He offered his arm, and the next"
"moment he was leading her away from that giddy, mocking crowd; and he"
felt the clinging clasp of her fingers thrilling him to his heart’s
core.  He heard the breath of relief as the chorus of flippant merriment
"died away in the distance. He paused, and a quick exclamation escaped"
his lips.
"""This is no place for you, Lady Geraldine.  Why do they bring you"
"hither?"""
"She answered not, but turned her gaze for a moment towards him, and then"
"dropped her eyes. With an impulse for which he could not account, he"
"covered the fingers which lay upon his arm with his own disengaged hand,"
and passionate words sprang to his lips.
"""Give me only the right, fair lady, and I will save you from them all."
I ask only to live and die as your knight—your champion—without
"wages—without reward!"""
Then he was silent.  His breath came thick and fast.  He felt the quiver
"of the hand he held.  He knew not how long the silence lasted, it was so"
"strangely sweet, so full of mysterious meaning."
"""I thank you, sir.  I trow that you speak truth, and that your words are"
not idle froth—gone in a moment—as the words of so many of yonder
firing in the distance.
Clear days and clear nights followed each other. Sometimes a train would
"stop in front of the C.C.S., hissing and puffing, and throwing up a"
"great shaft of light. We would curse it, fearing that it would attract"
German raiders.
If only the fine weather would come to an end! Give us wind and rain so
that we could lie in bed without being oppressed by anxiety! But the sun
continued to shine and the stars to glitter.
"The disaster that had befallen the adjoining C.C.S., which had been"
"brilliantly lit up during the raid, had acted as a warning example to"
us. At nightfall the windows of the theatre were screened with blankets
and no lights were allowed to show in the wards or on the duckboards.
If only the trains would halt somewhere else at night-time!
One day a number of Flemish peasants began to collect hop-refuse in the
surrounding fields. They made three great heaps of it and set fire to
"them. In the evening the heaps were burning brightly, but no one took"
any notice.
The canteen was crowded. All the benches were occupied and men who were
unable to find seats stood around in groups. There was noisy
conversation and singing and shouting. Nearly everyone was drinking
beer. Those who sat at the tables were playing cards. The air was thick
with tobacco-smoke. Two or three candles were burning on every table.
"And all at once, without any warning, the thunder was loosened upon us."
"There was an ear-splitting roar and in a moment candles were swept away,"
"benches and tables overturned, and the whole crowd of men was down on"
"the floor, trembling and panic-stricken. Another detonation, and then"
"'This is the place,' Steve muttered. 'It will be dawn in another hour."
"What do you think, Master Martin?'"
"'That we had better get off the road,' I answered. 'Take it they found"
him at midnight; the orderly's patience would scarcely last longer.
"Then, if they started after us a quarter of an hour later, they should"
be here in another twenty minutes.'
"'It is an aguey place,' he said doubtfully."
"'It will suit us better than the camp,' I answered."
"No one else expressed an opinion, and Steve, taking my lady's rein,"
led her horse on until he came to the hollow part of the road. Here
"the moonlight disclosed a kind of water-lane, running away between the"
"osiers, at right angles from the road. Steve turned into it, leading"
"my lady's horse, and in a moment was wading a foot deep in water. The"
"Waldgrave followed, then the women. I came last, with Marie's rein in"
"my hand. We kept down the lane about one hundred and fifty paces, the"
"horses snorting and moving unwillingly, and the water growing ever"
"deeper. Then Steve turned out of it, and began to advance, but more"
"cautiously, parallel with the road."
"We had waded about as far in this direction, sidling between the"
"stumps and stools as well as we could, when he came again to a stand"
"and passed back the word for me. I waded on, and joined him. The"
"osiers, which were interspersed here and there with great willows,"
rose above our heads and shut out the moonlight. The water gurgled
"black about our knees. Each step might lead us into a hole, or we"
might trip over the roots of the osiers. It was impossible to see a
"foot before us, or anything above us save the still, black rods and"
Johnson was strangely silent. He was wondering how his coming there
to-night had really come about. But he could find no solution to the
problem unless it was in response to that perverse instinct which
prompts us all at times to do the very thing which in our hearts we know
"to be wrong. The Girl, meanwhile, after a final creasing of the"
"neatly-folded cover, started for the cupboard, stopping on the way to"
pick up various articles which the wind had strewn about the room.
Flinging them quickly into the cupboard she now went over to the window
"and once more attempted to peer out into the night. But as before, it"
was of no avail. With a shrug she straightened the curtains at the
windows and started for the door. Her action seemed to quicken his
"decision, for, presently, with a gesture of resignation, he threw down"
his hat and coat on the table and said as if speaking to himself:
"""Well, it is Fate--my Fate that has always made the thing I shouldn't do"
"so easy."" And then, turning to the Girl, he added: ""Come, Girl, as you"
"say, if I can't go, I can't. But I know as I stand here that I'll never"
"give you up."""
The Girl looked puzzled.
"""Why, what do you mean?"""
"""I mean,"" began Johnson, pacing the floor slowly. Now he stopped by a"
"chair and pointed as though to the falling snow. ""Suppose we say that's"
an omen--that the old trail is blotted out and there is a fresh road.
"Would you take it with me a stranger, who says: From this day I mean to"
be all you'd have me. Would you take it with me far away from here and
"forever?"""
It did not take the Girl long to frame an answer. Taking Johnson's hand
she said with great feeling:
Nelson. More than once Sidney donned the cherry crêpe de chine and
"dined with Mrs. Allan and Pola and Dugald at the hotel, feeling very"
grand and traveled.
But to Sidney's deep regret Pola professed an abhorrence of swimming.
"""Just please don't _ask_ me,"" she had begged, shuddering. ""I loathe it!"
It's one of my complexes. Of course I've gone swimming in almost every
"body of water on the globe, but I hate it. You'll spoil my fun"
"_utterly_ if you even try to make me!"" After that Sidney could not"
"urge. She did not know what complexes were, but Pola had made them"
sound real and convincing and a little delicate. Though Sidney missed
the jolly swims with Lavender and Mart she refrained from even a hint
of her feelings.
Often when they were together Pola waxed confidential over her cousin.
"""He's a thorn in Aunt Lucy's side,"" she explained one day as the girls"
"lounged in Pola's room at the hotel, a huge box of candy on a stool"
"between them. ""She always wants him to go in for society and to go"
"abroad with her and do all the fashionable resorts on the Continent,"
"but couldn't you _see_ him? Not for Duggie boy, ever! When she starts"
planning something like that he bolts off somewhere and the next thing
you hear is that he's painted a wonderful picture and sold it or had
first mention or a gold medal. Of course that makes him terribly
interesting and there are dozens of single ladies from forty to
fourteen itching to catch him. And Dug's such a simple old dear that he
doesn't know it. But his mother does and she has them all sorted over
and the eligible ones ticketed. You see Dug will be dreadfully rich
some day and goodness knows what he'll do with the money for he hasn't
the brains of a child where business is concerned. His father's even
"richer than Dad."""
"should not reach the men around; ""these, when they get there, will think"
of nothing but plunder. As if rags and diamonds and gold were worth
"venturing one's life for. But I desire death--death--death, do you hear?"
"To see the Italian woman and her paramour pleading for their lives, one"
"wailing over against the other, on their knees. Oh, I know them and the"
brat they call the little Queen! To-night they shall lie dead under my
"hands--with this--with this!"""
And the girl flashed a razor-keen blade out of her red waistband. She
thrust the hilt forward into the Sergeant's hands as if in token of
fealty.
"""See,"" she said, touching the edge lovingly, ""is it not sharp? Will it"
"not kill surely and swiftly? For months I have sharpened it--ah, and"
"to-night it will give me my desire!"""
"It was the Sergeant's belief that the girl was mad, nevertheless he"
"watched her with his usual quiet scrutiny, the power of which she"
evidently felt. For she avoided his eyes and hastened on with her story
before he had time to cross-question her.
"""Why do I hate them? I see the question on your lips. Because the"
Italian woman hath taken away my father and slain my mother--slain her
as truly and with far sharper agony than she herself shall know when I
"set this knife to her throat. I am the daughter of Muñoz, and I swore"
revenge on the man and on the woman both when I closed my mother's eyes.
"My mother's heart was broken. Ah, you see, she was weak--not like me! It"
would take a hundred like the Neapolitan to break my heart; and as for
"the man, though he were thrice my father, he should beg his life in"
"vain."""
"She snatched her knife jealously out of his hand, tried its edge on the"
"nothing is wasted.  But a baby!""  And he chirruped his lips. ""Well;"
"courage!  We shall do things yet!"""
Gyp turned her head away to hide the quiver of her lips.  The scent of
"latakia tobacco that had soaked into things, and of old books and music,"
"a dark smell, like Monsieur Harmost's complexion; the old brown curtains,"
"the sooty little back garden beyond, with its cat-runs, and its one"
stunted sumach tree; the dark-brown stare of Monsieur Harmost's rolling
"eyes brought back that time of happiness, when she used to come week"
"after week, full of gaiety and importance, and chatter away, basking in"
"his brusque admiration and in music, all with the glamourous feeling that"
"she was making him happy, and herself happy, and going to play very"
finely some day.
"The voice of Monsieur Harmost, softly gruff, as if he knew what she was"
"feeling, increased her emotion; her breast heaved under the humming-bird"
"blouse, water came into her eyes, and more than ever her lips quivered."
He was saying:
"""Come, come!  The only thing we cannot cure is age.  You were right to"
"come, my child.  Music is your proper air.  If things are not all what"
"they ought to be, you shall soon forget.  In music--in music, we can get"
"away.  After all, my little friend, they cannot take our dreams from"
"us--not even a wife, not even a husband can do that.  Come, we shall have"
"good times yet!"""
"And Gyp, with a violent effort, threw off that sudden weakness. From"
those who serve art devotedly there radiates a kind of glamour.  She left
"Monsieur Harmost that afternoon, infected by his passion for music."
Poetic justice--on which all homeopathy is founded--was at work to try
"and cure her life by a dose of what had spoiled it.  To music, she now"
"gave all the hours she could spare. She went to him twice a week,"
"dead within him. If a man has lived a wicked life, he dies a wicked man,"
and no wicked man can obtain the perfect rest of the sinless dead.
Heaven is shut to him. But if heaven is shut it is not shut for ever; if
"hell may perhaps open to him it is only for a time, only till he is"
purified and washed from the stain of his sins; and then he can begin
"again, and have another chance to win heaven. If there is no immediate"
"heaven there is no eternal hell, and in due time all will reach heaven;"
"all will have learnt, through suffering, the wisdom the Buddha has shown"
"to us, that only by a just life can men reach the Great Peace even as he"
did.
So that if Buddhism has none of the consolation for the dying man that
"Christianity holds out, in the hope of heaven, so it has none of the"
threats and terrors of our faith. There is no fear of an angry Judge--of
a Judge who is angry.
"And yet when I came to think over the matter, it seemed to me that"
surely there must be something to calm him in the face of death. If
"Buddhism does not furnish this consolation, he must go elsewhere for it."
"And I was not satisfied, because I could find nothing in the sacred"
"books about a man's death, that therefore the creed of the people had"
"ignored it. A living creed must, I was sure, provide for this somehow."
"So I went to a friend of mine, a Burman magistrate, and I asked him:"
"'When a man is dying, what does he try to think of? What do you say to"
"comfort him that his last moments may be peace? The monks do not come, I"
know.'
"'The monks!' he said, shaking his head; 'what could they do?'"
I did not know.
its way as Trafalgar. It proved that the whole German Fleet could not
fight out an action against our full force and have the smallest hope
of success. I am just praying for the chance of a whack at them in the
"_Malplaquet_. My destroyer was a bonny ship, the best in the flotilla,"
"but the _Malplaquet_ is a real peach. You should see her."""
"""We mean to,"" said Cary. ""This very afternoon. You shall take us back"
"with you."""
"The Commander opened his eyes at this cool proposal, but we prevailed"
"upon him to seek the permission of the Admiral-Superintendent, who, a"
"good deal to my surprise, proved to be quite pliable. Cary's"
reputation for discretion must be very high in the little village
where he lives if it is able to guarantee so disreputable a scribbler
"as Bennet Copplestone! The Admiral, fortunately, had not read any of"
my Works before they had been censored. When printed in _Cornhill_
they were comparatively harmless.
I must not describe the _Malplaquet_. Her design was not new to me--I
had seen more than one of her type--but as she is now a unit in
Beatty's Fleet her existence is not admitted to the world. As we went
"up and down her many steep narrow ladders, and peered into dark"
"corners, I looked everywhere for a Marine sentry whom I could identify"
"by mark of ear as Dawson. I never saw him, but Trehayne passed me"
"twice, and I found myself again admiring his splendid young manhood."
"He was not big, being rather slim and wiry than strongly built, but in"
"sheer beauty of face and form he was almost perfectly fashioned. ""Do"
"you know that man?"" I asked of our commander, indicating Trehayne."
"""No,"" said he. ""He is one of the shore party. But I should like to"
have him with me. He is one of the smartest looking petty officers
"that I have ever seen."""
It was quite dark outside. The duckboards were lit up by rows of
hurricane lamps. The bombardment was still going on.
When I got back to the waiting-room all the prisoners were gone and
English wounded were taking their places. Soon the benches round the
stove were crowded with dark figures whose hands and faces were lit up
by the glow.
A man with haggard features and a bandage round his head began to talk
in a mournful voice:
"""Oh, it's 'ard ter lose yer mates. There was three of us--we was always"

this--this Celtic bareness and sombreness and _air_. But perhaps it is
not Celtic at all: Iberian. Nothing is more unsatisfactory than our
conception of what is Celtic and what is not Celtic. I believe there
"never were any Celts, as a race.--As for the Iberians--!"

"Wonderful to go out on a frozen road, to see the grass in shadow bluish"
"with hoar-frost, to see the grass in the yellow winter-sunrise beams"
"melting and going cold-twinkly. Wonderful the bluish, cold air, and"
"things standing up in cold distance. After two southern winters, with"
"roses blooming all the time, this bleakness and this touch of frost in"
"the ringing morning goes to my soul like an intoxication. I am so glad,"
"on this lonely naked road, I don't know what to do with myself. I walk"
"down in the shallow grassy ditches under the loose stone walls, I walk"
"on the little ridge of grass, the little bank on which the wall is"
"built, I cross the road across the frozen cow-droppings: and it is all"
"so familiar to my _feet_, my very feet in contact, that I am wild as if"
"I had made a discovery. And I realize that I hate lime-stone, to live on"
lime-stone or marble or any of those limey rocks. I hate them. They are
"dead rocks, they have no life--thrills for the feet. Even sandstone is"
much better. But granite! Granite is my favorite. It is so live under
"the feet, it has a deep sparkle of its own. I like its roundnesses--and"
"I hate the jaggy dryness of lime-stone, that burns in the sun, and"

"""I know to whom you refer,"" I said, with bowed head, after a moment's"
"pause.  ""It is currently reported that I love her.  I have loved her.  I"
do not seek to deny it.  When a man sustains such a blow as I sustained
"before we parted, he often rushes to another woman for consolation.  The"
influence of that second woman often prevents him from going to the bad
"altogether.  It has been so in my case."""
"""And you love her now?"" she cried, the fire of fierce jealousy in her"
"eyes.  ""You cannot deny it!"""
"""I do deny it,"" I cried.  ""True, until yesterday I held her in esteem,"
"even in affection; but it is not so now.  All my love for you, Yolande,"
has returned to me.  Our parting has rendered you dearer and sweeter to
"me than ever."""
"""I cannot believe it,"" she exclaimed falteringly."
"""I swear that it is so.  In all my life, although am compelled to treat"
"women with courtesy and sometimes to affect flirtation, because of my"
"profession as a diplomatist, I have loved only one woman--yourself;"" and"
"I raised her chilly hand to my lips, kissing it fervently."
Mine was no mere caprice at that moment.  With an all-consuming passion
"I loved her, and was prepared on her account to make any sacrifice she"
"demanded.  Let the reader remember what had already been told me, and"
"reflect that, like many another man, I loved madly, and was heedless of"
any consequences that might follow.  In this particular I was not alone.
"Thousands before me had been allured to their ruin by a woman's eyes,"
just as thousands of brave women's hearts have been broken and their
lives wrecked by men's false oaths of fidelity.  I have heard wiseacres

"Gyp produced her card.  The maid looked at it, at Gyp, and at two"
"brown-painted doors, as much as to say, ""Where will you have it?"" Then,"
"opening the first of them, she said:"
"""Tyke a seat, please; I'll fetch her."""
"Gyp went in.  In the middle of what was clearly the dining-room, she"
tried to subdue the tremor of her limbs and a sense of nausea. The table
"against which her hand rested was covered with red baize, no doubt to"
keep the stains of mutton from penetrating to the wood. On the mahogany
sideboard reposed a cruet-stand and a green dish of very red apples.  A
bamboo-framed talc screen painted with white and yellow marguerites stood
before a fireplace filled with pampas-grass dyed red.  The chairs were of
"red morocco, the curtains a brownish-red, the walls green, and on them"
hung a set of Landseer prints.  The peculiar sensation which red and
green in juxtaposition produce on the sensitive was added to Gyp's
"distress. And, suddenly, her eyes lighted on a little deep-blue china"
"bowl. It stood on a black stand on the mantel-piece, with nothing in it."
"To Gyp, in this room of red and green, with the smell of mutton creeping"
"in, that bowl was like the crystallized whiff of another world.  Daphne"
"Wing--not Daisy Wagge--had surely put it there! And, somehow, it touched"
"her--emblem of stifled beauty, emblem of all that the girl had tried to"
pour out to her that August afternoon in her garden nearly a year ago.
"Thin Eastern china, good and really beautiful!  A wonder they allowed it"
to pollute this room!
"A sigh made her turn round.  With her back against the door and a white,"
"scared face, the girl was standing.  Gyp thought: 'She has suffered"
"horribly.'  And, going impulsively up to her, she held out her hand."
"""I shall just see the elections through, and Perry well started--at"
"least, I suppose it'll be Perry--and then we'll be off. Shan't you be"
"glad to see the old home again, Al?"""
"""It's so sudden,"" she said. ""I shall be sorry to leave here."""
"""Oh, so shall I--very sorry to leave some of the people too. Still, it's"
"a good thing. Where's Eleanor? I must tell her. I say, Dick gets here"
"to-morrow."""
"""Oh, I'm so glad."""
"The Governor hurried out again, and Alicia returned to the sofa. The"
knot of her troubles had been rudely cut. Perhaps this summary ending
"was best. She herself would not, she knew, have had the strength to tear"
"herself away from that place, but if fate tore her--perhaps well and"
good. Nothing but unhappiness waited there for her; it seemed to her
"that nothing but unhappiness waited anywhere now; but at least, over at"
"home, she would not have to fear the discovery of her secret, the secret"
"she herself kept so badly, nor to endure the torture of gossip, hints,"
"and clumsy pity. No one, over at home, would think of Medland; they"
"might just know his name, might perhaps have heard him rumoured for a"
dangerous man and a vexatious opponent of good Sir Robert. Certainly
they would never think of him as the cause of bruising of heart to a
young lady in fashionable society. So he would pass out of her life; she
"would leave him to his busy, strenuous, happy-unhappy life, so full of"
"triumphs and defeats, of ups and downs, of the love of many and the hate"
"of many. Perhaps she, like the rest, would read his name in the _Times_"
"now and then, unless indeed he were utterly vanquished. No, he was not"
finally beaten. Of that she was sure. His name would be read often in
"cold print, but the glow of the life he lived would be henceforth"
"leave her lying in Genoa!"""
"""I'll attend to my own end of the business,"" said Captain Dove with"
"angry decision. ""If you're going to London by train to-night, so am I."

"not the only man on the _Olive Branch_ who can sail a ship. Why, I've"
half a dozen broken captains--and most of 'em with extra masters'

"""I've left Brasse and Da Costa in charge, and they'll work her across"
the Bay if I tell them to. I've only to send them a wire. And all you

"going to stick to you like a leech till the day you pay me off."""
"Slyne walked to the window, humming a tune. But it was obviously costing"
him all of his refreshed fortitude to refrain from expressing his real
"sentiments toward Captain Dove. His face, as he stood glaring blindly"
"out at the beautiful scene before him, was like that of a wild beast"
"balked of its fair prey. But from between his bared, set teeth the"
careless hum came unbroken.
"""I think you're foolish,"" was all he said when he turned again,"
convinced that it would be a waste of time to argue the matter with the
"old man, ""but--suit yourself. Jobling and I _must_ get to London with"
Sal--Lady Josceline at the earliest possible moment. If you insist on
travelling with us to-night--so be it. All I want you to understand is
"that there's to be no more drinking, and that you must be advised by me"
in every other particular. This isn't really the sort of game you're
liable to shine in. It would be far better for all of us if you'd stay
"on board your ship."""

potent. But what?

The q-b spies some of the blue-and-red stripe-and-line cotton stuff of
which the peasants make their dress: a large roll in the doorway of a
"dark shop. In we go, and begin to feel it. It is just soft, thickish"
"cotton stuff--twelve francs a metre. Like most peasant patterns, it is"
much more complicated and subtle than appears: the curious placing of
"the stripes, the subtle proportion, and a white thread left down one"
"side only of each broad blue block. The stripes, moreover, run _across_"
"the cloth, not lengthwise with it. But the width would be just long"
enough for a skirt--though the peasant skirts have almost all a band at
the bottom with the stripes running round-ways.
"The man--he is the esquimo type, simple, frank and aimiable--says the"
"stuff is made in France, and this the first roll since the war. It is"
"the old, old pattern, quite correct--but the material not _quite_ so"

It was not much after seven when we came to Mandas. Mandas is a junction
where these little trains sit and have a long happy chat after their
arduous scramble over the downs. It had taken us somewhere about five
hours to do our fifty miles. No wonder then that when the junction at
last heaves in sight everybody bursts out of the train like seeds from
"an exploding pod, and rushes somewhere for something. To the station"
"restaurant, of course. Hence there is a little station restaurant that"
"does a brisk trade, and where one can have a bed."
A quite pleasant woman behind the little bar: a brown woman with brown
"parted hair and brownish eyes and brownish, tanned complexion and tight"
"brown velveteen bodice. She led us up a narrow winding stone stair, as"
"up a fortress, leading on with her candle, and ushered us into the"
"bedroom. It smelled horrid and sourish, as shutup bedrooms do. We threw"
open the window. There were big frosty stars snapping ferociously in
heaven.
"The room contained a huge bed, big enough for eight people, and quite"
clean. And the table on which stood the candle actually had a cloth. But
"imagine that cloth! I think it had been originally white: now, however,"
it was such a web of time-eaten holes and mournful black inkstains and
poor dead wine stains that it was like some 2000 B.C. mummy-cloth. I
wonder if it could have been lifted from that table: or if it was
mummified on to it! I for one made no attempt to try. But that
"table-cover impressed me, as showing degrees I had not imagined.--A"
table-cloth.
"been there, and had secured all the little snakes. There were seven of"
them.
"We asked the boys what they intended to do with the snakes, and they"
answered that they would show them to their friends in the village. 'And
then?' we asked. And then they would let them go in the water. My friend
"killed all the hamadryads on the spot, and gave the boys some coppers,"
and we went on. Can you imagine this happening anywhere else? Can you
"think of any other schoolboys sparing any animal they caught, much less"
poisonous snakes? The extraordinary hold that this tenet of their
religion has upon the Burmese must be seen to be understood. What I
"write will sound like some fairy story, I fear, to my people at home. It"
is far beneath the truth. The belief that it is wrong to take life is a
belief with them as strong as any belief could be. I do not know
"anywhere any command, earthly or heavenly, that is acted up to with such"
earnestness as this command is amongst the Burmese. It is an abiding
principle of their daily life.
Where the command came from I do not know. I cannot find any allusion to
it in the life of the great teacher. We know that he ate meat. It seems
to me that it is older even than he. It has been derived both by the
Burmese Buddhists and the Hindus from a faith whose origin is hidden in
the mists of long ago. It is part of that far older faith on which
"Buddhism was built, as was Christianity on Judaism."
But if not part of his teaching--and though it is included in the sacred
"books, we do not know how much of them are derived from the Buddha"
himself--it is in strict accordance with all his teaching. That is one
"of the most wonderful points of Buddhism, it is all in accordance; there"
are no exceptions.
I have heard amongst Europeans a very curious explanation of this
"said ""with all her own private grudge against the present ministry"
she felt _au fond_ she was _British_; she must range herself in time
"of war with her own people."""
Mrs. Warren went much farther. She was not very voluble nowadays.
The German occupation of her villa had given her a mental and
physical shock from which she never recovered. She often sat quite
silent and rather huddled at meal times and looked the old woman
now. In such a conversation as this she roused herself and her voice
"took an aggressive tone. ""My daughter write to her friends to ask"
them to obstruct the government at such a time as this? _Never!_ I'd
"disown her if she did, I'd repudiate her! She may have had her own"
"turn-up with 'em. I was quite with her there. But that, so to"
"speak, was only a domestic quarrel. We're British all through, and"
don't you forget it--sir--(she added deprecatingly): British _all
"through_ and we're goin' to beat Germany yet, _you'll_ see. The"
"British navy never _has_ been licked nor won't be, this time."""
Colonel von Giesselin did not insist. He seemed depressed himself at
"times, and far from elated at the victories announced in his own"
newspapers. He would in the dreary autumn evenings show them the
photographs of his wife--a sweet-looking woman--and his two
"solid-looking, handsome children, and talk with rapture of his home"
"life. Why, indeed, was there this War! His heart like his Emperor's"
bled for these unhappy Belgians. But it was all due to the
"Macchiavellian policy of ""Sir Grey and Asquiss."" If Germany had not"
felt herself surrounded and barred from all future expansion of
trade and influence she would not have felt forced to attack France
"and invade Belgium. Why, see! All the time they were talking,"
"barbarous Russia, egged on by England, was ravaging East Prussia!"
"Then, in other moods, he would lament the war and the policy of"
"with willows growing round it. In the field beyond, a cow was grazing"
peacefully. The sky seemed a deeper blue through the willow-branches.
The tender green of the grass was wonderfully refreshing to the eyes.
The cow had a beautiful coat of glossy brown that shone in the sunlight.
I abandoned myself to the charm of the little idyll that was spread out
before me and forgot the war once again.
"And then all at once a gigantic, plume-shaped, sepia coloured mass rose"
"towering out of the ground. There was a rending, deafening, double"
thunder-clap that seemed to split my head. For a moment I was dazed and
my ears sang. Then I looked up--the black mass was thinning and
collapsing. The cow had disappeared.
I walked into the yard full of rage and bitterness. All the men had left
the sheds and were flocking into the road. Some were strolling along in
"leisurely fashion, some were walking with hurried steps, some were"
"running, some were laughing and talking, some looked startled, some"
"looked anxious, and some were very pale."
"We crossed the road and the railway. Then, traversing several fields, we"
"came to a halt and waited. We waited for nearly an hour, but nothing"
happened and we gradually straggled back to the yard.
Some of us walked to the spot where the shell had burst. There was a
"huge hole, edged by a ring of heaped-up earth, and loose mould and"
grassy sods lay scattered all round. Here and there lay big lumps of
bleeding flesh. The cow had been blown to bits. The larger pieces had
"already been collected by the farmer, who had covered them with a"
tarpaulin sheet from which a hoof protruded.
"The next day, at about the same hour, the dark cloud again rose from the"
ground and the double explosion followed. We again abandoned the yard
"were hundreds of pounds owing, it seemed, and, in addition, much to Rosek"
himself.  The thought of these debts weighed unbearably on her.  Why did
"he, HOW did he get into debt like this?  What became of the money he"
"earned?  His fees, this summer, were good enough.  There was such a"
"feeling of degradation about debt.  It was, somehow, so underbred to owe"
"money to all sorts of people.  Was it on that girl, on other women, that"
he spent it all?  Or was it simply that his nature had holes in every
pocket?
"Watching Fiorsen closely, that spring and early summer, she was conscious"
"of a change, a sort of loosening, something in him had given way--as"
"when, in winding a watch, the key turns on and on, the ratchet being"
broken.  Yet he was certainly working hard--perhaps harder than ever.
"She would hear him, across the garden, going over and over a passage, as"
if he never would be satisfied. But his playing seemed to her to have
"lost its fire and sweep; to be stale, and as if disillusioned.  It was"
"all as though he had said to himself: ""What's the use?""  In his face,"
"too, there was a change.  She knew--she was certain that he was drinking"
secretly. Was it his failure with her?  Was it the girl?  Was it simply
heredity from a hard-drinking ancestry?
Gyp never faced these questions.  To face them would mean useless
"discussion, useless admission that she could not love him, useless"
"asseveration from him about the girl, which she would not believe,"
useless denials of all sorts.  Hopeless!
"He was very irritable, and seemed especially to resent her music lessons,"
alluding to them with a sort of sneering impatience.  She felt that he
"despised them as amateurish, and secretly resented it. He was often"
"impatient, too, of the time she gave to the baby.  His own conduct with"
the little creature was like all the rest of him. He would go to the
"nursery, much to Betty's alarm, and take up the baby; be charming with it"
confinement of Sicily. Room--give me room--give me room for my spirit:
and you can have all the toppling crags of romance.
"So we ran on through the gold of the afternoon, across a wide, almost"
"Celtic landscape of hills, our little train winding and puffing away"
"very nimbly. Only the heath and scrub, breast-high, man-high, is too big"
"and brigand-like for a Celtic land. The horns of black, wild-looking"
cattle show sometimes.
"After a long pull, we come to a station after a stretch of loneliness."
"Each time, it looks as if there were nothing beyond--no more"
habitations. And each time we come to a station.
Most of the people have left the train. And as with men driving in a
"gig, who get down at every public-house, so the passengers usually"
alight for an airing at each station. Our old fat friend stands up and
"tucks his shirt-tail comfortably in his trousers, which trousers all the"
"time make one hold one's breath, for they seem at each very moment to be"
"just dropping right down: and he clambers out, followed by the long,"
brown stalk of a wife.
"So the train sits comfortably for five or ten minutes, in the way the"
"trains have. At last we hear whistles and horns, and our old fat friend"
running and clinging like a fat crab to the very end of the train as it
sets off. At the same instant a loud shriek and a bunch of shouts from
"outside. We all jump up. There, down the line, is the long brown stork"
"of a wife. She had just walked back to a house some hundred yards off,"
"for a few words, and has now seen the train moving."
"Now behold her with her hands thrown to heaven, and hear the wild shriek"
"""Madonna!"" through all the hubbub. But she picks up her two skirt-knees,"
and with her thin legs in grey stockings starts with a mad rush after
"utmost danger, and that she must instantly come downstairs, open the"
"gate, and accompany them to the palace."
"""I knew it,"" quavered the old woman, ""I knew it since ever my husband"
went away with the soldiers and left me here alone. I shall be murdered
"among you, but my blood will be on his hands. Indeed, sirs, he hath"
"never treated me well, but spent his wages at the wine tavern, giving me"
"but a beggarly pittance. Nay, how do I know but he had an intent in thus"
"deserting me? He hath, and I can prove it, cast eyes of desire on Maria"
"of the pork-shop, only because she is younger and more comely than I,"
who had grown old and wrinkled bearing him children and cooking him
"_ollas_! Aye, and small thanks have I got for either. As indeed I have"
told him hundreds of times. Such a man! A pretty fellow to be head
porter at a Queen's gate! I declare I will inform her Royal Majesty this
"very night, if I am to go to the palace, that will I!"""
"""Come down immediately and let us in, my good woman,"" said the Sergeant,"
soothingly. For it appeared as if this torrent of accusation against the
absent might continue to flow for an indefinite period.
"""But how am I to know that you are not the very rogues and thieves of"
"whom you tell?"" persisted the old lady with some show of reason."
"""Well,"" said the Sergeant forbearingly, ""as to that you must trust us,"
"mother. It is the best you can do. But fear nothing, we will treat you"
"gently as a cat her kitten, and you will come up to the palace with us"
"to show us in what part of it dwell the Queen and her daughter."""
"""Nay, not if it be to do harm to my lady and the sweet little maid who"
"this very day brought a pail of milk to poor old Rebeca the portress,"
whose husband hath forsaken her for a pork-shop trull. I would rather
"die!"""
"We rowed in the foam and feathery jets of spray. ""She's rising fast!"""
"cried Eilert, rowing with all his might."
I felt so wretched that Eilert told me to ship my oars; he would manage by
"himself. But for all my wretchedness, I remembered that they could see me"
"from the shore, and I would not put down my oars. Eilert's wife might see"
me and laugh at me.
"What a revolting business, this seasickness that forced me to put my head"
"over the gunwale and make a pig of myself! I had a moment's relief, and"
then it began all over again. Charming! I felt as though I were in labor;
"the wrong way up, of course, through my throat, but it was a delivery"
"nonetheless. It moved up, then stopped, came on again and stopped, came on"
"and stopped once more. It was a lump of iron--iron, did I say? No, steel;"
I had never felt anything like it before; it was not something I was born
with. All my internal mechanism was stopped by it. Then I took a running
"start far down inside me and began, strangely, to howl with all my"
"strength; but a howl, however successful, cannot break down a lump of"
"steel. The pains continued. My mouth filled with bile. Soon, thank heaven,"
my chest would burst. O--oh--oh.... Then we rowed inside the islands that
"served as a breakwater, and I was saved."
"Quite suddenly I was well again, and began to play the clown, imitating my"
"own behavior in order to deceive the people ashore. And I assured Eilert,"
"too, that this was the first time I had ever been seasick, so that he"
"should understand it was nothing to gossip about. After all, he had not"
heard about the great seas I had sailed without the slightest discomfort;
"once I had been four-and-twenty days on the ocean, with most of the"
"passengers in bed, and even the captain sick in cascades; but not me!"
"""Yes, I get seasick sometimes, too,"" says Eilert."
"A figure went to and fro by the water's brim, a figure pale in the"
"moonlight, as the form of the restless dead. The man kneeling in the"
bracken pressed his hands over his breast; his face seemed to start
"out of the gloom as the face of one who struggles in the sea,"
"submerged, yet desperate."
"Francesco saw the woman halt beside the mere. He saw her bend, take"
"water in her palms and dash it in her face. Standing in the moonlight,"
"she smoothed her hair between her fingers, her hands shining white as"
ivory against the dark bosom of her dress. She seemed to murmur to
"herself the while, words wistful and full of woe. Once she thrust her"
"hands to the sky and cried: ""Francesco! Francesco!"" The man kneeling"
in the shadows quivered like a wind-shaken reed.
The moon climbed higher and the woman by the mere spread her cloak
upon a patch of heather and laid herself thereon. Not a sound broke
"the silence; the woods were mute, the air lifeless as the steely"
water. An hour passed. The figure on the heather lay still as an
"effigy on a tomb. The man in the bracken cast one look at the stars,"
then crossed himself and crept out into the moonlight.
"Holding the scabbard of his sword, he skirted the mere with shimmering"
"armor, went down upon his knees and crawled slowly over the grass."
Hours seemed to elapse before the black patch of heather spread crisp
"and dry beneath his hands. Breathing through dilated nostrils, he"
trembled like one who creeps to stab a sleeping friend. The moonlight
"seemed to shower sparks upon him, as with supernatural glory. Tense"
anguish seemed to fill the night with sound.
Two more paces and he was close at the woman's side. The heather
"crackled beneath his knees. He held his breath, crept nearer, and"
knelt so near that he could have kissed Ilaria's face. Her head lay
she was to wait by the seashore. So at last the Master Girl had to give
in.
"""But when you get there, you must not take time to greet a single"
"person. You must at once go to the stable, harness the horses, and drive"
"back as swiftly as you can. They will all come to meet you, but you"
"must act as though you did not see them, and must not take a single bite"
"to eat. If you do not do that, you will make both of us unhappy,"" said"
she. And he promised to do as she had said.
"But when he got home to the castle, one of his brothers was just getting"
"married, and the bride and all the guests were already there. They all"
"crowded around him and asked him this, and asked him that, and wanted to"
"lead him in. But he acted as though he saw none of them, led out the"
"horses, and began to put them to the coach. And since they could by no"
"manner of means induce him to come into the castle, they came out with"
again. What th' deuce d'ye mean by shouting at me as if I were a drunken
deck-hand! Speak to me above a whisper now--and you'll see what'll
"happen to you. That's the police-boat pulling past."""
The opportune plash of oars had suggested to him that plausible threat.
"Captain Dove, listening intently, crouched back against the bulkhead,"
"his blinking, hot, suspicious eyes on Slyne's. The boat passed on. But"
"he had found time to observe that Slyne was in evening dress, with an"
expensive fur coat to keep the cold out. And Slyne's cool contempt for
his ill-temper would seem to have impressed him no less than Slyne's air
of solid prosperity.
"He himself, it appeared, had had care and adversity for his companions"
ever since parting with his former friend. His chief aim in calling at
"Genoa had been cheap coal and cheaper repairs, and he thought that he"
was less likely to be recognised there than elsewhere in the
every possible cutter of the wires on the mat before the Captain and
"me. We have looked into all their records, had their homes visited and"
"their people questioned, inquired of their habits--Mr. Copplestone,"
"here, knows what comes of drink--and found out how they spend their"
wages. Yet we have discovered nothing. It is the worst puzzle that
"I've struck. When and how the gun cable was cut I can't tell you, but"
whoever did it is much too clever to be about. He must have been
"exactly informed of the lie and use of the cables, had with him the"
"proper tools, and used them in some fraction of a minute when he"
wasn't under the eye of my own man whose business it was to watch
everybody and suspect everybody. I thought that I had schemed out a
pretty thorough system; up to now it has worked fine. Whenever we have
"had the slightest reason to suspect any man, we have had him kept off"
"the ship and watched. We have run down a lot of footling spies, too"
"stupid to give us a minute's anxiety, but this man who cut the"
"_Antinous_'s wires is of a different calibre altogether. He is AI, and"
"when I catch him, as I certainly shall, I will take off my hat to"
"him."""
"""You say that the _Antinous_ is all right now?"" I observed."
"""Yes. I saw her towed out of the repair basin an hour ago, and she"
must be away down the river by this time. It is not of her that I'm
"thinking, but of the other ships which are constantly in and out for"
"repairs. There are always a dozen here of various craft, usually small"
stuff. While the man who cut those wires is unknown I shall be in a
"perfect fever, and so will the Admiral-Superintendent. We'll get the"
"beauty sooner or later, but if it is later, there may be had mischief"
"done. If he can cut wires in one ship, he may do much worse things in"
"some other. The responsibility rests on me, and it is rather"
"crushing."""
"stooping, as I fancied, and more than once standing to listen, as if"
"he were not satisfied. I sank down still lower, and he passed me"
"without notice, and went on, and I heard his footsteps slowly"
retreating until they quite died away.
"But in a moment, before I had risen to my full height, I heard them"
"again. He came back, and passed me, breathing quickly and loudly. I"
wondered if he had detected our party and was going to give the alarm;
"and I stood up, anxious and uncertain, at a loss whether I should"
follow him or run back.
"At that instant a fierce yell broke the silence, and rent the darkness"
"as a flash of lightning might rend it. It came from behind me, from"
the brow of the hill; and I started as if I had been struck. Hard on
"it a volley of shouts and screams flared up in the same direction, and"
"while my heart stood still with terror and fear of what had happened,"
"I heard the thunder of hoofs come down the road, with a clatter of"
blows and whips. They were coming headlong--my lady and the rest. The
"danger was behind them, then. I had just time to turn and get to the"
side of the road before they were on me at a gallop.
"I could not see who was who in the darkness, but I caught at the"
"nearest stirrup, and, narrowly escaping being ridden down, ran on"
"beside the rider. The horses, spurred down the slope, had gained such"
an impetus that it was all I could do to keep up. I had no breath to
"ask questions, nor state my fear that there was danger ahead also. I"
had to stride like a giant to keep my legs and run.
Some one else was less lucky. We had not swept fifty yards from where
"I joined them, when a dark figure showed for a moment in the road"
before us. I saw it; it seemed to hang and hesitate. The next instant
"it was among us. I heard a shrill scream, a heavy fall, and we were"
"it, along the line of shivering women, and, pulling myself heavily"
"into the branches, managed to scramble up a few feet. The tree swayed"
"under my weight, but it bore me."
"The first dawn was whitening the sky and casting a faint, reflected"
"light on the glistening sea of osiers, that seemed to my eyes--for I"
was not high enough to look beyond it--to stretch far and away on
"every side. Here and there a large willow, rising in a round, dark"
"clump, stood out above the level; and in one place, about a hundred"
"paces away on the riverside of us, a group of these formed a shadowy"
"mound. I marked the spot, and dropped gently into the water."
"'I have found it,' I said. 'I will go first, and do you bring my lady,"
Steve. And mind the stumps. It will be rough work.'
"It was rough work. We had to wind in and out, leading and coaxing the"
"frightened horses, that again and again stumbled to their knees. Every"
minute I feared that we should find the way impassable or meet with a
"mishap. But in time, going very patiently, we made out the willows in"
"front of us. Then the water grew more shallow, and this gave the"
"animals courage. Twenty steps farther, and we passed into the shadow"
"of the trees. A last struggle, and, plunging one by one up the muddy"
"bank, we stood panting on the eyot."
It was such a place as only despair could choose for a refuge. In
"shape like the back of some large submerged beast, it lay in length"
"about forty paces, in breadth half as many. The highest point was a"
poor foot above the water. Seven great willows took up half the space;
"it was as much as our horses, sinking in the moist mud to the fetlock,"
could do to find standing-room on the remainder. Coarse grass and
reeds covered it; and the flotsam of the last flood whitened the
"trunks of the willows, and hung in squalid wisps from their lower"
"old enemy of his, and the sight of the fellow’s humiliation had inclined"
the riverman even more strongly toward the man who had brought it about.
"But that was over now, he told himself furiously as he stamped along the"
"stream, hands clenched and face set in a black scowl. He hated"
Bainbridge! The man had no right to jump on him that way. How did he
know what had been the cause of Kollock’s behavior? He had asked no
"questions, given Curly no chance to explain even had the latter been"
inclined to lower himself to that extent. He had taken it for granted
that the river jack was loafing in spite of the fact that record as a
worker was equal to that of the best.
This was where the sting lay. Kollock was aggrieved and disgruntled
"because of what was, to him, a very good reason. There had been a"
definite object in his pause by that stone. The night before he had
"received a brief note from Bill, in which he was urged to “make use of"
any chance you git to do--you know what.”
Curly did know “what” very well. It meant that he was to thwart and
delay the progress of the drive by any means in his power. _Any_ means!
"The simplest, of course, was to cause some to happen to Bainbridge"
himself. Bill had not hesitated to suggest several ways by which this
happy end could be reached. None of them appealed particularly to Curly.
"He was not overscrupulous, but he disliked doing up a man in cold blood"
"without giving him even a ghost of a show. Still, Bill had done him good"
"turns more than once when he was out of work; and, last but not least,"
there was the financial side of the affair. Curly had never been told
"who or what was back of these attacks on the independent lumber company,"
but he knew there was plenty of money in it.
All this he had been thinking over as he sat smoking that cigarette. In
the end he decided to have nothing to do with it. Bainbridge had trusted
servile to be capable of feeling humiliation and too stupid to
"understand what danger is--that's the man who makes a good, steady"
soldier. We've seen men so horribly smashed up by bombs that it makes
"you sick to look at them, and then people expect us not to be afraid of"
"air-raids. The civvies haven't seen that sort of thing, so they may well"
"show plenty of pluck, although I believe there are a good many with"
"enough imagination to have the wind up when there's an air-raid on."""
"""Bloody true. You know, if there was a lot o' civvies an' a lot of"
"Tommies in a Blighty air-raid, I reckon the civvies'd show more pluck"
than the Tommies. My mate who's workin' on munitions told me 'e saw
'underds o' soldiers rushin' to take shelter in the last raid on London.
"O' course there was crowds o' civvies doin' the same, but 'e says there"
was a lot what didn't seem to care a damn. The other day we 'ad a bloody
parson spoutin' to us--'e said war brings out a man's pluck an' makes an
"'ero of 'im. I reckon that's all bloody tosh! War makes cowards of yer,"
"that's the 'ole truth o' the matter, I don't care what yer say. I didn't"
"know what fear was afore I joined the army. I know now, you bet! I'm a"
bloody coward now--I don't mind admittin' it. There's things I used ter
do what I wouldn't dare do now. When we go up the line I'm in a blue
funk from the time I 'ears the first shell burst to the time we goes
over the top. An' when we goes over I forgets everythink an' don't know
what I'm doin'. P'raps I'll get a V.C. some day wi'out knowin' what I
done ter get it. And I'm not the only one like that. Anyone 'oo's bin
out 'ere a few months an' says 'e ain't windy up the line's a bloody
"liar, there now...."""
"""By the way,"" I interrupted, ""how did that orderly who works in the"
theatre get his Military Medal--he had the wind up more than any of us
"the other night?"""
"""I know whom you mean,"" answered a private of the R.A.M.C. ""He got it"
Blighty! I was in hospital six weeks and then I got ten days' sick leave
"in London. Fritz came over one night--Christ, I didn't half have the"
"wind up! We were sitting in the kitchen, mother and father didn't seem"
to mind much--they didn't know what it meant. Fritz had never dropped
"any our way before. I never heard such a barrage, at least not for"
aeroplanes. It wasn't so bad as out here all the same--you could take
"shelter, anyhow. Air-raids are bloody awful things, they put my wind up"
"much more than shell-fire."""
We finished our work as the sun was setting. The clouds on the horizon
"had vanished. One by one the stars came out. It was ""an ideal night for"
"a raid."""
Soon after dark a man was brought into the station with a crushed knee.
Immediate operation was necessary. He was carried into the theatre and
laid on to one of the tables. He received an anæsthetic and became
unconscious. With his scalpel the surgeon made a deep cut in the
knee-joint and searched the cavity with his finger. There was a Sister
standing by. Also an orderly who had won the Military Medal for bravery
in an air-raid some months before. Suddenly there was an outburst of
anti-aircraft firing and a tumultuous whistling of shells overhead. It
"lasted for several seconds and then with a deafening, reverberating"
"thunder-clap that shook the entire theatre, the first bomb fell. Before"
our ears had ceased drumming another bomb exploded and then another. The
"orderly, who had held his hands in front of his face, now gave way to"
fear. He darted madly to and fro and then scuttled beneath a table. The
"Sister, who had remained quite calm, said in an amused voice: ""Pull"
"yourself together, it's all over now."" The orderly got up trembling, his"
face very white. The surgeon had not moved away. He had just grasped the
"edge of the table tightly and had bent his head forward, while his"
muscles seemed stiff with a violent but successful effort at
"self-control. The anæsthetist, too, had remained on his stool, but was"
"whose names were unknown to Grey, but who evidently were characters well"
known to the others of the company.
"""There is no such thing as justice left, or purity of taste, or any such"
"thing!"" shouted a handsome, well-proportioned fellow, whose face had"
"attracted Grey’s notice several times, and seemed dimly familiar to him."
"""Look at the mouthing mountebanks that walk the boards now!  They strut"
"like peacocks, they gibber like apes.  They have neither voice, nor"
"figure, nor talent, nor grace.  But, forsooth, because some fine dame"
"has smiled upon them, or they are backed by a nobleman’s patronage, they"
"can crow it over the rest of us like a cock upon his dunghill, and we,"
"who have the talent and the gifts, may rot like rats in our holes!"""
"""Shame! shame! shame!"" cried an admiring chorus."
"""Look at me!"" thundered the young man, his eyes flashing.  ""Who dares"
"say I cannot act?  Have I not held spellbound, hanging on my lips, whole"
houses of beauty and fashion?  Have I lost my skill or cunning?  Has my
"voice or has my grace departed from me?  Wherefore, then, do I sit here"
"idle and hungry, whilst men not fit to black my boots hold the boards"
"and fill their pouches with gold?  Why such injustice, I say?"""
A chorus of indignation again arose; but out of the shadows came a deep
voice.
"""The answer is easy, friend Lionel; arrogance and drink have been the"
cause of your downfall.  How could any manager continue to engage you?
How many times has it happened that you have come to the theatre sodden
with drink?  How many representations have you spoiled by your bestial
"folly? They were patient with you.  Oh yes, they were very patient; for"
they knew your gifts and recognized them.  But you met friendly rebuke
or warning with haughtiness and scorn.  You would listen to no counsel;
We marched to an extensive R.E. park and saw-mill near a railway siding.
We had to dismantle the machinery and load everything of any value on to
a train. For several hours five of us dragged a huge cylinder and piston
along the ground. We toiled and perspired. We made a ramp of heavy
wooden beams in front of the train and then we slowly pushed the iron
"mass into a truck. We went back and, raising a big fly-wheel on its edge"
"and supporting it with a wooden beam under each axle, we rolled it"
"painfully along, swaying from side to side."
"Then there came the long-drawn familiar whine, and the black smoke arose"
behind some trees a hundred yards away and the thunder-clap followed. A
jagged piece of steel came whizzing by and lodged in a stack of timber
behind us.
We pushed the wheel up the ramp and returned to fetch heavy coils of
"wire, bundles of picks and shovels, sacks and barrels of nails. Our"
"backs and shoulders ached, our hands and finger-tips were sore."
Another shell came whining over. It burst by a little cottage. Its
thunder made our ears sing. The fragments of flying metal made us duck
or scatter behind the stacks.
We worked until we almost dropped with sheer fatigue. Iron rods and bars
"for reinforcing pill-boxes, bags of cement, boxes of tools, parts of"
"machinery, all went on to the train. Then we entered a big shed, where"
a number of tar-barrels stood in a row. We rolled them out and placed
them by the timber stacks. We laid a pick beside each barrel so that it
"could be broached, the tar set alight, and the entire park destroyed at"
a moment's notice.
It was dark when we stopped work. We reached camp after an hour's
wearisome marching. We waited in a long queue outside the cook-house.
"another, shaking the ground and reverberating, and sending up showers of"
"stones and loose earth that came rattling down on to the canteen-roof,"
"while the huddled, sprawling mass of human bodies shook and squirmed"
"with terror. The droning of propellers could be plainly heard, then it"
"grew weaker and weaker, until it passed away. One by one the men got up."
"Someone lit a candle. Tables, benches, and prostrate bodies had been"
thrown into confusion. Cards and coins and overturned beer-mugs littered
the floor. The smell of spilt beer mingled with the smell of stale
tobacco. A few of us stepped out into the open air. We inhaled a
"pungent, sulphurous stench. We were sure our camp had been bombed this"
time and were fearful lest any of our friends had been hit. We walked
past the Church tent--it was full of rents and holes. And just beyond it
was a huge pit with fresh soil heaped up in a ring around it. Loose
earth and stones and sods were scattered everywhere. Then we saw
"something move in the darkness--it was a man on all fours, dragging"
himself painfully along and uttering a groan with every breath. Two
bearers arrived with a stretcher. They put it down by his side and
helped him on to it. Then they picked it up and disappeared in the
gloom. We had hardly walked a few yards further when we saw a light
approaching us. We went towards it. A man was staggering slowly along
and leaning on the shoulder of a comrade who was carrying a lantern. He
"supported his right elbow with his left hand, down the back of which"
two thin streams of blood were winding. His left sleeve was darkly
stained and the blood was dripping from it. His face was very pale and
the corners of his mouth were slightly turned down.
Suddenly the broad white beam of a searchlight swung across the
darkness. For a time it seemed to paw the sky in a hesitating fashion
and then it remained fixed on one spot.
"""There 'e is! There 'e is!"" someone shouted in an excited voice."
is proud of it.
"""It comes from my home."" And then he asks about the bread of Sicily. Is"
"it any whiter than _this_--the Mandas rock. Yes, it is a little whiter."
"At which they gloom again. For it is a very sore point, this bread."
Bread means a great deal to an Italian: it is verily his staff of life.
"He practically lives on bread. And instead of going by taste, he now,"
"like all the world, goes by eye. He has got it into his head that bread"
"should be white, so that every time he fancies a darker shade in the"
loaf a shadow falls on his soul. Nor is he altogether wrong. For
"although, personally, I don't like white bread any more, yet I do like"
"my brown bread to be made of pure, unmixed flour. The peasants in"
"Sicily, who have kept their own wheat and make their own natural brown"
"bread, ah, it is amazing how fresh and sweet and _clean_ their loaf"
"seems, so perfumed as home-bread used all to be before the war. Whereas"
"the bread of the commune, the regulation supply, is hard, and rather"
"coarse and rough, so rough and harsh on the palate. One gets tired to"
death of it. I suspect myself the maize meal mixed in. But I don't know.
"And finally the bread varies immensely from town to town, from commune"
to commune. The so-called just and equal distribution is all my-eye. One
"place has abundance of good sweet bread, another scrapes along, always"
"stinted, on an allowance of harsh coarse stuff. And the poor suffer"
"bitterly, really, from the bread-stinting, because they depend so on"
this one food. They say the inequality and the injustice of distribution
comes from the Camorra--la grande Camorra--which is no more nowadays
"than a profiteering combine, which the poor hate. But for myself, I"
"don't know. I only know that one town--Venice, for example--seems to"
"have an endless supply of pure bread, of sugar, of tobacco, of"
salt--while Florence is in one continual ferment of irritation over the
"stinting of these supplies--which are all government monopoly, doled out"
accordingly.
_déjeuner_ and of dry bread and octopus soup for dinner soon changed my
outlook upon life. Little wonder then if these folk after six weeks of
such treatment were nervous and excitable.
Such was the condition of body and mind in which they attended the
"long service of Good Friday night. Service I have said, but drama"
"were a more fitting word, a funeral-drama. At the top of the nave,"
"just below the chancel-step, stood a bier and upon it lay the figure"
"of the Christ, all too death-like in the dim light. The congregation"
"gaze upon him, reverently hushed, while the priests’ voices rise in"
prayer and chant as it were in lamentation for the dead God lying
there in state. Hour after hour passes. The women have kissed the
"dead form, and are gone. The moment has come for carrying the Christ"
"out to burial. The procession moves forward--in front, the priests"
"with candles and torches and, guarded by them, the open bier borne"
"shoulder-high--behind, a reverent, bare-headed crowd. The night is"
"dark and gusty. It rains, and the rugged, tortuous alleys of the town"
"are slippery. It is late, but none are sleeping. Unheeding of wind"
"and rain, the women kneel at open door or window, praying, swinging"
"censers, sprinkling perfume on the passing bier. Slowly, haltingly, led"
"by the dirge of priests, now in darkness, now lighted by the torches’"
"flare and intermittent beams from cottage doorways, groping at corners,"
"stumbling in ill-paved by-ways, the mourners follow their God to his"
grave. The circuit of the town is done. All have taken their last look
upon the dead. The sepulchre is reached--a vault beneath the church
from which the funeral started. The priests alone enter with the bier.
"There is a pause. The crowd waits. The silence is deep as the darkness,"
only broken here and there by a deep-drawn sigh. Is it the last depth
"of anguish, or is it well-nigh relief that the long strain is over?"
"The priests return. In silence the crowd have waited, in silence they"
disperse. It is finished.
"you cleaned out the stable?"" he asked. ""Yes, indeed, master, it is"
"spick and span,"" said the king's son. ""I'll have to see that,"" said the"
"giant, and went into the stable; but it was just as the king's son had"
"said. ""You surely have been talking to the Master Girl, for you could"
"not have done that alone,"" said the giant. ""Master Girl? What is a"
"Master Girl?"" said the king's son, and pretended to be very stupid. ""I'd"
"like to see her, too."" ""You will see her in plenty of time,"" said the"
giant.
The next morning the giant went off again with his goats. And he told
"the king's son he was to fetch his horse from the pasture, and when he"
"had done this, he might rest: ""For you have come to a kind master,"" said"
"he. ""But if you enter one of the rooms which I forbade you entering"
"yesterday, I will tear off your head,"" he said, and went away with his"
"herd. ""Indeed, you are a kind master,"" said the king's son, ""but in"
"spite of it I'd like to have another little talk with the Master Girl,"
"for she is just as much mine as yours,"" and with that he went in to her."
"She asked him what work he had to do that day. ""O, it is not so bad"
"to-day,"" said the king's son. ""I am only to fetch his horse from the"
"pasture."" ""And how are you going to manage that?"" asked the Master Girl."
"""Surely it is no great feat to fetch a horse from pasture,"" said the"
"king's son, ""and I have ridden swift horses before."" ""Yet it is not an"
"easy matter to ride this horse home,"" said the Master Girl, ""but I will"
"tell you how to set about it: When you see the horse, he will come"
"running up, breathing fire and flame, just as though he were a burning"
"pine-torch. Then you must take the bit that is hanging here on the door,"
"and throw it into his mouth, for then he will grow so tame that you can"
"do what you will with him."" He would take good note of it, said the"
"king's son, and he sat there with the Master Girl the whole day long,"
"and they chatted and talked about this and that, but mainly about how"
"delightful it would be, and what a pleasant time they could have, if"
they could only marry and get away from the giant. And the king's son
"coins, and had thrown it into the pond because it was stolen money. ""But"
"a four-shilling piece floated, and that I took along, because it was"
"honest,"" said the boy. ""You are a fool,"" said the woman--for she was as"
"angry as could be--""if nothing were honest save what floats on the"
"water, there would be but little honesty left in the world. And if"
"the money had been stolen ten times over, still you had found it, and"
"charity begins at home. If you had kept the money, we might have passed"
the rest of our lives in peace and comfort. But you are a dunderhead and
"will stay a dunderhead, and I won't be tormented and burdened with you"
"any longer. Now you must get out and earn your own living."""
"So the boy had to go out into the wide world, and wandered about far"
and near looking for service. But wherever he went people found him too
"small or too weak, and said that they could make no use of him. At last"
"he came to a merchant. There they kept him to work in the kitchen, and"
he had to fetch wood and water for the cook. When he had been there for
"some time, the merchant decided to journey to far countries, and asked"
all his servants what he should buy and bring back home for them.
"After all had told him what they wanted, came the turn of the little"
fellow who carried wood and water for the kitchen. He handed him his
"four-shilling piece. ""Well, and what am I to buy for it?"" asked the"
"merchant. ""It will not be a large purchase."" ""Buy whatever it will"
"bring, it is honest money, that I know,"" said the boy. His master"
"promised to do so, and sailed away."
Now when the merchant had discharged his cargo in foreign parts and had
"reloaded, and had bought what his servants had desired, he went back to"
"his ship, and was about to shove off. Not until then did he remember"
"that the scullion had given him a four-shilling piece, with which to"
"buy him something. ""Must I go up to the city again because of this"
four-shilling piece? One only has one's troubles when one bothers with
"such truck,"" thought the merchant. Then along came a woman with a bag on"
"would have forgotten the pasture and the horse altogether, had not the"
Master Girl reminded him of them toward evening. He took the bit that
"hung in the corner, hurried out to the pasture, and the horse at once"
"ran up, breathing fire and flame; but he seized the moment when he came"
"running up to him with his jaws wide open, and threw the bit into his"
"mouth. Then he stood still, as gentle as a young lamb, and he had no"
"trouble bringing him to the stable. Then he went to his room again, and"
began to whistle and sing. In the evening the giant came home with his
"goats. ""Did you fetch the horse?"" he asked. ""Yes, master,"" said the"
"king's son. ""It would make a fine saddle-horse, but I just took it"
"straight to the stable."" ""I'll have to see that,"" said the giant, and"
"went into the stable. But there stood the horse, just as the king's son"
"had said. ""You surely must have spoken to my Master Girl, for you"
"could not have done that alone,"" said the giant. ""Yesterday the master"
"chattered about the Master Girl, and to-day he is talking about her"
"again. I wish master would show me the creature, for I surely would like"
"to see her,"" said the king's son, and pretended to be very simple and"
"stupid. ""You will get to see her in plenty of time,"" said the giant."
"On the third morning the giant went off again with his goats. ""To-day"
"you must go to the devil, and fetch me his tribute,"" said he to the"
"king's son. ""When you have done that, you may rest for the remainder of"
"the time, for you have come to a kind master, and you might as well know"
"it,"" and with that he went off. ""You may be a kind master,"" said the"
"king's son; ""yet you hand over some pretty mean jobs to me in spite of"
"it, but I think I'll look after your Master Girl a bit. You claim that"
"she belongs to you, but perhaps, in spite of it, she may tell me what to"
"do,"" and with that he went in to her. And when the Master Girl asked him"
"what the giant had given him to do that day, he told her he must go to"
"the devil and fetch a tribute. ""But how will you go about it?"" asked the"
"Master Girl. ""You will have to tell me that,"" said the king's son, ""for"
"I have never been to the devil's place, and even though I knew the way"
"badly, but there were plenty of leaves left on it. I stared at it,"
"trying hard to keep awake. But soon the trunk began to quiver, then it"
wobbled with a wavy motion like a snake. Then the leafy part seemed to
"shoot out in all directions until there was nothing but a green blur,"
and I fell back against the trench wall and my rifle clattered down. I
"pulled myself together, absolutely mad with fear, because I kept on"
thinking of the last time I went on guard and the court martial and the
death sentence. I ground my teeth and stared at the tree again. But the
trunk began to wobble with snaky undulations and the green blur grew
"bigger and bigger in sudden jerks, while I tried frantically and"
desperately to keep it small. But it got the better of me and all at
once it obscured everything with a rush and I dropped forward and
knocked my forehead against the steel plate. I pulled myself together
and prayed for a Blighty or something that would get me out of this
"misery. I looked at my watch--O God, only five minutes had gone,"
one-twelfth of my time! I had a kind of panic then and I dashed my head
wildly against the trench wall and I bit my lips--I almost enjoyed the
"pain. I looked through the hole. The tree was steady at first, but it"
"soon began to wobble again. Then I said to myself: 'I don't care, I'll"
"risk it, I won't look out, I'll just keep awake. I don't suppose any"
Fritzes will come along--I'll just peep through the holes from time to
time so as to make sure.' I stamped on the duckboard and kicked the
sides of the trench and jerked my rifle up and down just to keep myself
awake. It was all right at first and I was beginning to think I would
"get over it somehow, but my feet soon felt as heavy as lead and my head"
began to swim until I fell forward once again. Jesus Christ--I didn't
"know what to do. I thought of looking at my watch, but I hadn't the"
"courage at first. Besides, I felt the seconds would slip by while I was"
hesitating and so I'd gain at least a little time. I counted the
"seconds--one, two, three ... four ... five ... six ... my head dropped"
forward and I nearly fell over. I looked at my watch--fourteen minutes
"had gone, nearly a quarter of an hour! That wasn't so bad. I felt a"
But there is a sequel on the morrow. Soon after dark on Easter-eve
the same weary yet excited faces may be seen gathered in the church.
"But there is a change too; there is a feeling abroad of anxiety, of"
"expectancy. Hours must yet pass ere midnight, and not till then is"
"there hope of the announcement, ‘Christ is risen!’ The suspense seems"
long. To-night there is restlessness rather than silence. Some go to
and fro between the church and their homes; others join discordantly
in the chants and misplace the responses; anything to cheat the long
hours of waiting. Midnight draws near; from hand to hand are passed
"the tapers and candles which shall light the joyful procession, if"
only the longed-for announcement be made. What is happening there now
behind those curtains which veil the chancel from the expectant throng?
"Midnight strikes. The curtains are drawn back. Yes, there is the"
"bier, borne but yesternight to the grave. It is empty. That is only"
"the shroud upon it. The words of the priest ring out true, ‘Christ is"
"risen!’ And there behind the chancel, see, a second veil is drawn back."
"There in the sanctuary, on the altar-steps, bright with a blaze of"
"light stands erect the figure of the Christ who, so short and yet so"
"long a while ago, was borne lifeless to the tomb. A miracle, a miracle!"
Quickly from the priest’s lighted candle the flame is passed. In a
moment the dim building is illumined by a lighted taper in every hand.
"A procession forms, a joyful procession now. Everywhere are light and"
"glad voices and the embraces of friends, crying aloud the news ‘Christ"
is risen’ and answering ‘He is risen indeed.’ In every home the lamb is
"prepared with haste, the wine flows freely; in the streets is the flash"
"of torches, the din of fire-arms, and all the exuberance of simple"
joy. The fast is over; the dead has been restored to life before men’s
eyes; well may they rejoice even to ecstasy. For have they not felt the
"ecstasy of sorrow? This was no tableau on which they looked, no drama"
"in which they played a part. It was all true, all real. The figure on"
the bier was indeed the dead Christ; the figure on the altar-steps was
indeed the risen Christ. In these simple folk religion has transcended

Did your wedding get called off?
He said with his own lips that he wasn't my brother-in-law!
Is that why he's not answering my phone calls?
That's because...
Yoon Jae has a situation right now.
He even insulted me!
Stupid!
He pretended he didn't know me.
He totally dissed dad!
-That wasn't Yoon Jae who did that...!
-Then...
Then who is the person I saw earlier?
And who's the one that acted like he didn't know me?
That was Yoon Jae.
"It's over, it's over."
It's over.
Oh my!
"It's our son-in-law, Yoon Jae!"
Did you eat the dumplings?
Do you know what was inside those?
Huh?
Try to guess.

He was in trouble.

Always said he had Everything under control.
That he had a lot of money put away.
Enough for a lifetime.
Okay.
"Hey, how about Diana Krall?"
"Oh, actually, that's your brother's CD."
Do you mind bringing it back to him?
Not at all.
I think I have one of his T-shirts.
You might as well take that too.
No problem.
"Hey, this is a cool, little CD player."
"Oh, thanks. lt was a gift from your-- lt was a gift."
Perfect.
is there anything else Charlie left behind?
Just me.
My brother's a fool.
No argument here.
-That is a very effective negligée.
-Thank you.
-Was it a gift?
-No.
"-As a matter of fact, I bought it myself."
"-Oh, good."
-How long ago?
-What?
"Well, I was just wondering if Charlie saw it."
"Alan, don't go there."
"Oh, I wasn't going anywhere."
It's just that--
-Nothing.
More kissing.
"-Okay, okay."
What exactly is bothering you?
"Well, it's kind of hard to explain."
"I wonder where I shall put him, though."
"In George's room, of course."
That's what he's accustomed to.
No!
He is a handsome brute!
How does she merit all these men?
MARIE:
He looks angry.
I don't think he appreciated being left behind at Nohant.

"Well, I was 40."
Who wants to be 40?
I wouldn't mind.
"Were you there, Mrs Magath?"
'Course.
We were all there.
"Us, Jo, Scottie, Michael."
Michael?
~ Michael Woodruff.
~ Who's he?
Michael and me were Scottie's best friends.
Since we were kids.
Where can we find him?
Organising the bin strike.
"Oh, that Michael Woodruff."
~ Good news for rats.
~ Hm!
"Do you think we could take Jo home, assuming she's identified the body?"
Although it might not be him.
"No, it is him."
You seem to be... ~ What?
"~ Are you suspicious, or something?"
No.
Though I wouldn't mind finding out who took a lump out of your face.
"Oh, this."
"Oh, it's er..."

Michael started smashing chairs over our heads.
Why was that?

"No, not if you promised it to her."
"- Well, I'll see you around, okay?"
- Okay.
Allison.
Did you see your mother dancing with Mr. Rossi?
- I've never seen my mother dance.
- Standing over there.
They make a good-looking couple.
They do?
"- Hi, Norman."
- Hi.
"Dance with me, Norman."
- I don't know how.
- Just try.
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.
"Hey, Rodney, you got a new car."
Yeah.
"Hey, come on, get in."
"Rodney, it's beautiful."
"Here we are, snug as peas in a pod."
- Where are we going?
- Nowhere.
"Hey, I'm mad at you."
"Come on, Betty."
"You really want to kiss me, don't you?"
"- Boy, do I."
- Tell me how much.
Tell me.
"The hook is in, and I'm close."
Vinnie is Eddie's passport to an honorable death.
- All I got to do...
- Vinnie's dead.
- Murdered.
- What?
Vinnie Zapatti's dead.
He washed up near the 79th Street Basin.
"- Oh, God."
- Heads up.
Call when you get to your office.
Taxi!
Bronx.
Take East River Drive.
Now look.
I don't have a lot of time.
I cleared it with the captain.
Take all the time you need.
You're pulling rank on me?
Still looking for a new shoe size?
I know all the jokes.
Cement C.
What I need now are the straight lines.
The police commissioner works for the mayor.
- What is your point?
- Trust me or fuck you.
Stand up.
I just need to see how many people that I'm talking to.
It's just me.
All right.
Eddie called me from Manhattan South.
The night before?
I'd rather have four honest words than 50 pages of bilge.
"- Now, you play Rose..."
"- No, I play Rose."
And I play Lily.
This script is the best thing I have read in a month of Sundays.
- Don't you think?
- Well...
- Wyndham Best.
I play Johnnie.
- Johnnie?
- The soldier.
- Ah.
"Or the hero, if you will."
...a documentary about the Clydeside dockers.
Right.
Who have we got here?
"Ah, Alex, mind if I join you?"
Documentary makers and authenticity.
- The rancid curds.
"Buckley, just hide me, hide me."
What?
Uncle Frank.
Mr. Hilliard.
- You knew he was gonna be here.
"- Yes, but I didn't expect to be."
- Is she all right?
Avoiding Hilliard.
Unfortunate experience.
- Carnal?
- What?
No.
"Oh, that?"
Weight?
- What they were wearing?
- It was far away.
Into pleural space.
Tube.
Chen?
OpSite and Polysporin.
Tube's in.
Hook up the Thora-Seal.
Any detail would help us.
"Sats are back up, 91."
- Were they Latinos?
Black guys?
- I don't know.
It happened so fast.
Let's page Corday.
"Hey, Trina, you did really good."
"Rest up now, okay?"
"For us to get to work here, we need a real description."
I saw one of them.
I think he was black.
"Driver, get out nice and calm."
Face the vehicle.
- Welcome to the ' hood.
"- Passenger, come around to this side."
Face the vehicle.
Put your hands up on the roof.
Grab the roof.
"Hey, man, take it easy."
License and registration's in the glove.
"- Hey, what are we being stopped for?"
- Easy.
Yes.
They might shoot us if we touch her.
She's valuable government property.
(GROWLS)
"Hey, I can see her face better now."
(CHATTERING)
She doesn't look like Sally.
Are you Sally?
(CHATTERING)
"Well, since it's Judy, we'd, uh, better take care of that leopard."
Uh-huh.
Be my guest.
(GROWLS)
(YOWLS)
"Ok, nut."
Come on down.
"Very nice work with that leopard, fella."
Thank you.
That's a handy gun to have around.
"Mr. Dane, I'm sorry that we doubted you."
We heard her confession.
"But if this is Judy, where is Sally?"
"Uh, beats me."
(THUDDING)
"Judy, stop that."
The least you can do is show them you're sorry.
"Thank you, Judy."
Now all you have to do is tell me where Sally is.
(CHATTERING)
You had the helmet.
You must know where she is.
(VEHICLE APPROACHING)
"I don't know, I'm..."
"It's sick, you know?"
That's all.
[SIGHS]
[DOOR CLOSING]
What are you doing?
"I was, um, I was just..."
You were with someone in here.
"No, I wasn't."
Who was it?
Skip?
I said I was alone.
"Okay, okay, fine."
I just thought I heard a man's voice.
"Come on, the meeting's started."
Let's go.
"Hello, my name is Skip, and I'm an addict."
"Hi, Skip."
Uh...
I was in love... with a bottle.
"We slept together, we worked together, and... we got fired together, and, uh...if--if booze was..."
"my demon, then, uh... 12 Steps To Recovery has... has been my angel of mercy."
"It didn't happen overnight, and, uh..."
"I never would have made it without my sponsor, Monica."
"What is this, some kind of sick joke?"
[GUN COCKS]

Are you out of your mind?
Clean this up and go to your room!
You're not our mom.
To your room!
Show us your birthmark.
- Enough!
- Show us your birthmark.
I've had it.
"Anything else, maybe?"
( Door slams )
I want you to say 10 times that I'm your mother.
- Open up!

I don't know.
RAY:
"Where does he live, goddamn it?"
JACKIE:

RAY:
How do you get your shit?
"I said, where does he live, bitch?"
If we told anybody where Marco lives he'd kill us.
"Well, what the fuck do you think we're going to do, huh?"
Leave us the hell alone!
Don't hit her like that.
Please tell him and everything will be okay.
Jackie don't know.
I deal with Marco.
She don't.
Leave her alone and I'll tell you.
MARCO:

I invited Amy to our after-work hang.
[breathily]:
Oh...
"Hi, Amy."
AMY:
Sorry we're late.
It was a crazy day at the office.
"I had to calculate the company's overtime, then I realized that was making me go overtime, and that I had to include that, too... ugh, my life!"
I could really use a drink.
"I'll go order two beers, Amy."
Maybe they'll give me a third one
I didn't ask for.
"Jack, help!"
Emma doesn't know this is a date.
How can that be?
You were so clear when you asked her out.
"I know, but she brought her friend Amy."
"Okay, don't panic."
"He's Mr. ABCD, he's good at playing deadly games."
He's going to play Russian Roulette!
There are 3 bullets in this Russian Roulette.
Over there!
Let's start the game!
I'm done!
"Hiroshima, he's shot himself 3 times!"
"Damn it, wake him up!"
He's dead.

You're terrific!
You always know where they are!
Sure. I know exactly where they are.
"So you go first, I'll protect you from the back."
Are you alright?
Sure I'm alright!
I can hear something!

I'm so pleased you're not dead!
"Indy, Indy, we have no time."
"If you still want the Ark, it is being loaded onto a truck for Cairo."
Truck?
What truck?
Let's go!
Get back to Cairo.
"Get us some transport to England... boat, plane, anything."
Meet me at Omar's.
Be ready for me.
I'm going after that truck.
- How?
- I don't know.
I'm making this up as I go.
Ew!
He's there!
Idiot!

Everything at last has been arranged.

Charles just emailed.
He'll call me in ten minutes.

Did you?
Well...
I thought so.
- Who drove off last night?
- It was Jacob.
"I thought Johannes drove him, but he couldn't have."
- Jorgen lent him to Jacob.
- He never lends out Johannes.
He did to Jacob.
It seems he is giving it all to that Jacob.
Helene Hansson.
I'd like to speak to Doctor Philippsen.
Remember to lie.
How big was it?
You have to agree or she won't believe it...
"Good, off you go."
- We caught one that was this big.
- No way!
"It's true, but it got away."
I have to go to town.
Jorgen?
Won't you stay for lunch?
We ate on the way.
I'll be home in a few hours.
- Jorgen?
I spoke to Doctor Phillipsen.
- Yes.
Phillipsen's under confidentiality.
That's totally unacceptable.
He promised me.
He's betrayed my trust.
"Wow, in stereo."
Great.
Thanks.
You ready to go?
"Hey, perfect timing."
"- How is it, haole?"
- Shamu.
What's with the stick?
You got slammed in a cruncher?

- Sand facial.
"You ate a big one, huh?"
There was no surfing accident.
"He, uh, busted his knee getting out of bed."
- How white can you get?
- Pretty white.
- Who's this?
"- This is my sister, Mary."
"- Mary, meet Kamekona."
- Hey.
This is the reason I called.
I want a friendly face to make sure she stays put.
"Oh, come on."
You want me to babysit your little sister?
- Correct.
"- Shoots, small kine."
"She doesn't leave this office, you under..."
"Whoa, whoa!"
Hold on.
Seriously?
What if I have to use the bathroom?
- Don't spill.
- Try a practical demonstration.
- It's a good idea.
Go forit!
Hurry.
- Waiter?

"You have to say ""oway""."
He's here.
We'd Iike to order...

"I don't understand a word, I'm Venetian, been here fortwo months."
Are you alright?
I Ieft you so many messages.
Weren't you supposed to call as soon as you got there?
"Yes, but I was in a meeting."
- I have to reorganize everything.
- How are you?
"Fine, they're very welcoming."
- It's not even hot.
- Stop it.
Stop lying.
"I'm yourwife, you can tell me you're suffering."
"Sure, it's tough, it's a mess here."
I knew it!
- How well I know you.
- I'II be back in two weeks.

I heard a woman's voice.
"- It's Maria, my neighbor."
"Mommy is dead, Gonki."
Mommy is dead.
Yes.
Want me to sleep here?
Gonki Galonki is sad.
Daddy Galonki is very sad too.
How long have you been here?
I just got here.
"You look good, Daddy."
How are you?
I'm fine.
And you?
Great.
How's your son?
He is in the army theater.
That doesn't surprise me.
And your wife?
Nira and I got divorced 5 years ago.
I didn't know.
"Until it happened, I didn't know either."
"Here, something sweet."
Thank you.
"It's a good play, ""The Enchanted Nose""."
"Yes, it's never been done here before."
"Maybe in drama school, I'm not sure."
It's a lovely comedy.
So much street wisdom.
Renee had a very sharp eye.
They don't write like that anymore.
How many characters?
They all fit into a cab.
Could a play like that work today?
We are here to see--
- What is his name?
We're here--
- Vagina.
"No, we're here to see Raza."
OK.
Follow me.
"Thank you, ma'am."
"We'll follow...you, I guess."
"Ba-dunk, ba-dunk, ba-dunk"
"She got it, she got it"
"She got it, she got it"
"- Hey, guys."
- Hey.
"- Hey, Raza!"
- What?
What's up?
- Kumar and Roldy?
"- What's up, man?"
I haven't seen you guys since graduation.
What are you guys doing here?
"Wait, what's up with the orange jumpsuits?"
"- Hey, no, no, question number one--"
- It's kind of a long story. l-  ...what's up with this party?
- What do you mean?
There's exposed vagina all over your house.
Yeah.
That was my idea.
"I don't know about you guys, I'm sick of all the hype over topless."
Really?
I always liked toplessness.
That's--
- No.
"- Uh, well, it's tomorrow."
"All right, um, Horace?"
Listen.
It's been a month.
I didn't need Ricky to tell me what we already know.
He's gone.
So-
- So what are you gonna do?
- What are you talking about?
What the fuck-
- What are you--
Why are you saying this to-- What are you saying to me right now?
Why are you saying this?
"- Horace, because, right now is right now."
Pete is gone.
Are you gonna do Easter?
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
- Iâm not doing Easter.
Iâm not doing any of that.
None of that makes sense without Pete here.
"- Okay, so, then close this place down."
Go do something else.
- I can' t do that.
- Why not?
"- Because he's gonna come back, 'cause he might come back."
- He's-
"- Horace, he is not coming back."
Horace.
"Pete is dead, Horace."
Fuck it.
- Okay.
Is there a safe word you can think of?
Something easy to remember in distress?
"How about the word ""stop""?"
"- Good choice. ""Stop"" it is."
- Yeah.
"Okay, we'll leave you to enjoy your evening."
- Alright.
- You'll hear from me in a moment.
Just make yourself at home.
"Okay, all right."
"Well, take her easy."
Harlech...
Shadow.
Is this real?
"Yeah, it's real."
That's real.
It's really dead.
-  Cooper.
"- Oh, hey."
- Are you hearing me?
- Loud and clear.
Oh!
"Reaching for the Dutch courage already, I see."
- I'm afraid that wine's non-alcoholic.
- Lame.
"- Well, we need you with a clear head."
- Okay.
Fair point.
Fair point.
This is high-quality craftsmanship.
This is nice.
"- Eh, the answer is... no."
No?
Then why did you save her from jail?
You taught her to save me.
It's only fair I save her.
What's your relationship with this girl?
Tell me!
"Fung-wu, the Highness is behind this."
He deliberately pinned the blame on us.
Someone is there!
"We're surrounded, let's go inside."
- They're the Ching army!
"- And archery, too!"
What shall we do now?
Their aim is Mr. Chao and me.
We'll escape in different directions.
"Fung-wu, you and Miss Cheung should escape out the back window."
Yan-ling and I will fight them in the front.
Shoot!
Now!
Run!
"You go first, I'll stop them!"
Miss Cheung!

It was the same day the girls disappeared.
I was at the farmhouse waiting for a brick.
- It was five in the morning.
- What kind of car was it?
A white Dyane 6.
He drove right past me.
The car had a sticker on the back window.
What kind of sticker?
A woman with long hair and a hat.
- How long?
This long?
- A little shorter.
- What was the hat like?
- Big.
Like a priest.
Like this?
I've seen this before somewhere.
"- Anything else, Fermin?"
- That's what I saw.
Hey.
I did see your problem.
The dead are waiting for you.
It's almost time.
He gave her these towels.
They were from the hotel where he worked in Malaga.
- What was her friend's name?
- Sebastian.
- Sebastian what?

- Have you ever seen him?
- Ming-kai!
- Tat-chi!
So you're the representatives.
- Yes.
- Yes.
Fantastic!
I've already heard much about you.
This will be a magnificent fight!
This is really an honor.
Yes!
"Sir, I won't fight!"
Sir!
"Ming-kai, we must count on you."
"Tat-chi, the Shaolin are depending on you."
Start!
Go.
Go.
Sung-chi!
"No matter who wins, see that my orders are carried out."
This is a fair duel.

Don't stop!
Fight!
Fight!

So how come you are here?
I just came here for dinner.
"Anyway, I saw your designs."
Lovely.
They are awesome.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
You hid the secret for so long.
"Well, Vivek, I tried to show you my designs before."
But..
I couldn't show it.
"What do you mean, couldn't show it?"
I don't understand.
Shall we meet tomorrow and talk?
Few things I need to tell you.
Yeah.
Fine.
Okay.
Okay.
I will see you then.
- See you.
"Ma'am, hold on."
I will give it.
Take this.
"Sir, here is your lemonade and honey."
And towel.
You didn't bring today's newspaper?
"Sir, I am searching for today's newspaper since yesterday."
Shall I bring yesterday's newspaper?
Yes.
"If possible, bring a few years' old newspaper."
Bring 30-40 years' old.
Good night.
"Don't get too attached, Dale."
"Come on, Jill."
We're gonna go have a sleepover at Dale's tonight.
Drew!
You ok?
She needs a couple glasses of water and some sleep.
Let's go.
- Yeah.
"Come on, babe."
"Ah, that's disgusting."
No.
This is definitely picture worthy.
Is that her puke bucket?
Look at...
Becca's panties.
They're grannie panties.
Bowie.
He's gonna have the worst diarrhea in the morning.
"It's so weird getting older, isn't it?"
Everything just... changes so fast.
"Yeah, but that's supposed to be the exciting part, isn't it?"
Why haven't you ever dated Zach?
Because I never felt like I was...
good enough for him.
"But you like him a lot, right?"
Yeah.
And you think he's handsome.
Yeah.
And he likes that dog of yours.
Yeah.
He loves Bowie.
How?
Knocked him on the head.
And who's speaking?
"Ah, Yuri Nikolayevich!"
Meet you?
All right!
"Hey, man with a mustache!"
"Maria Vasilyevna, how are you?"
"I've been watching you for a long time, by the way."
It's hard to recognize you.
Good for you!
Hi.
And what's this round thing?
This round thing.
- You bought a cake?
"- No, it's a hat."
"Right, it's time."
Soon the last ones will fall down.
- Are we waiting for someone?
"- No, nobody."
And the flowers?
For you.
What?
No way!
God forbid!
Take them away!
I'm not some young girl!
What's so bad about it?
It's interesting.
"The interesting is around the corner to the left, as my granddaughter says."
"Come on, Maria Vasilyevna!"
"Look, what's going on?"
He would've gone in search of his father.
- What did you say now?
- My foot!
"You watch cartoons on laptop, he would've left your area along with his father."
"This place is my fortress, I'll get him at any cost."
"Enough of searching there, come on boys."
"Come on boys,"
Find him whether he is here.
Search inside.
- Playing cards?
- How much?
- 250
- Calm!
"Drinks, cards, you need any woman?"
May I send one?
- He's here!
- Who?
Your Godfather!
Singamuthu's son!
He beat my partner.
Hey Konda Reddy!
Has my son come here?
How could I judge it?
I can get it from your scared face.
You're shivering.
You're sweating profusely.
Konda Reddy is scared because my son is here!
"Yes, he has come!"
But he'll not go alive from here.
Come on boys!
Get up!
Come!
-Come on.
-Where's your father?
-Christmas shopping.

They've got no right dropping bombs!
Are you a Jap-lover?

-Bunch of saps...
-Why are they saps?
-Let's not talk about the war.
You talk to Carlo.

-They risk their lives for their country.

You're OK.
That's what's important.

"Oh, sure."
I believe that one.

I told you.
It'll be a bore.

And then we'd all be charred alive after supper in a dinner-hall fire
"Look, boys."
- Where...?
He's the one
Where have we landed?
Was this your idea?
Us?
Or the waiters?
- For me.

Me?
Really?

You might've.
I go to so many parties
You know Sheena...

Is it true they wanted to leave town?
- Who doesn't?
- I don't.
- You're lame.
- And you're jealous.
Okay.

It's Quini.

Can we go now?
You can leave.

He's in Germany.
He's been working there for two years.

On the bend.
That's where it stopped.
- Did you see how many people were in the car?
- No.
- Were they forced into the car?
- I think they knew each other.
"Gibbs, Lance Corporal Finn's fiancée's upstairs."
She saw a report on the local news last night.
"How, Doctor?"
"As soon as I know, you'll know."
Her name is Siri Albert.
"She's 25, lives in Manassas, and works as a physical therapist."
- Finn's fiancée is here.
I put her in the conference room.
- You did?
I did.
"No, I did."
His fiancée?
"Yeah, his fiancée."
Tall ?
Like brown hair ?
Red hair.
Someone has made a huge mistake.
James isn't dead.
He's been writing me letters from Iraq.
It's a common name.
"The news said he was born in Jackson, Pennsylvania."
It's a small town.
That James Finn has been dead three months.
He left for Iraq three months ago.
I saw him the morning he went away.
And I just got a letter from him last week.
He says he misses me and he's working a lot.
We'll need those.
"Okay, but I want them back."
It's his handwriting.
I recognize it.
They've been coming for months.
Sculptor?
"Yeah, every family's got a"
Black sheep.
"Most families get, like, a"
"Retard, or a guy that likes to"
"Wear dresses, we got a sculptor."
"Yeah, retard, sculptor."
Same thing really.
"Yeah, there was a retard"
Sculptor.
60 minutes did a piece on him I
Think.
Yeah.
Really brilliant work.
"And he was real quick, too."
He'd make like one or two
Statues a day.
Only one problem though.
What was that?
He liked the taste of clay.
"So you're saying... yeah, he'd eat his own work."
"Goddamn, what a waste."
"Not really, you know every"
"Time he took a shit, genius."
"Ah, Lou."
"T, you and the probie go down"
"That way, Franco and I are gonna"

"Now, Claudia..."
Okay...
"Now, focus."

He'll be dead inside an hour.

I'll hold him.

"Yes, ma'am."
Why would Walker steal his own work?

Someone who knew what they were doing.
No signs of a struggle.
Clean shot.
It's professional.
I've got another question.
Where's the tenth piece?
The tenth piece?
"Yeah, there are nine recovered pieces here."
The surveillance from the gallery shows that Walker had ten photo collages in the show.

Put the gun down.
- It's just starting.
- Please!
I think Tommy has some questions for you.
Tommy?
Comments?
"I feel your anger, yes!"
"Yes, I got your blood pumping, yes?"
No?
Now use it!
Harness it!
Hmm.
Boom!
Everybody into the children's pose!
Heads down.
Okay.
Close your eyes.
Yes?
"Yes, good."
Let's breathe.
"Excuse me, Salvadore?"
I feel like my sacrum is really tight.
Could you just help me stretch it out a little?
"Yes, of course, I will play the role of your husband."
Great.
"Boom, boom."
-.
Boom.
The rain room has fire.
I did not see that coming.
I was getting centered.
I was enjoying the island.
What if Joey had seen?
"Lucy, it was really inappropriate."
"Well, I didn't know that you were so concerned about how Joey felt."
What's that supposed to mean?
Let's drop it.
All I'm saying is that it was pretty uncomfortable.
No one is there.
Hey why are you peeking and scaring my girlfriend?
I'm not scaring her.
Look at my back.
Hey why me?
Brother for god sake look at my back.
Hey I'm not like that.
Neither am I.
I've been shot!
Look at my back.
Stop the car.
I'll count to 3.
You can't die.
Shall I shoot.
This diamond is gone.
And the other diamond...
Fake diamond.
Papa will be shocked once he sees it.
This is the 20 crores diamond.
Do you know?
Why do I've myself called Papa?
Why Papa?
Because Demelo only knows about having.
Pa Pa...
Papa.
And you came back and left the diamond.
You know that electricity only comes for 2 hours a day.
And you let it go to waste.
Tell me...
Where is the diamond?
Like every time electricity went this time too.
Now it'll be back Tommorow.
I want revenge!
He said.
But before anyone could do anything...
Ba-bam!
"It was awful and it was terrible, and it was really, really scary."
What?
No!
Go back!
"Although the charming was fast,"
I was swift enough to repel the attack and leap to safety.
Which is exactly what he wanted you to do.
Oh!
"Charming laughed, just like a crazed maniac."
Ha ha ha ha ha.
Whoa-oa-oa!
"No, no, no, no, no."
"I'm sorry, but I would never let that happen to me."
"Instead, I..."
I...
I woke up.
Yeah.
That's right!
It was all a dream.
You mean a nightmare.
"You know you're on the ceiling, right?"
I will get you for this.
Oh!
And then the lights went out.
It was horrible and sad how Puss pleaded for mercy!
Mercy?
Please!
Said Puss with his last dying breath.
Got any dough?
Something better.
You're not leaving me?
Whas wrong?
You don't like me?
"Endo, endocrinology, whas it mean?"
How should I know?
"Hurry up, is hurting worse!"
"And ""oto-rhino-laryngology?"""
I'm not a dictionary.
Any doctor's OK.
All I know is I'm pissing blood.
He's hurt!
You fix him up or I'll smash your head in.
Get it?
Abrasion of the left testicle.
It took 3 stitches.
The bullet missed the artery...
He sure was lucky.
We're always lucky.
Incredibly lucky.
The golden touch.
Glad to hear it.
I was worried about you.
"Don't worry, just hand over your dough."
I don't have any on me I have to go to the bank.
No kidding?
I just used my last check.
You're not putting me on?
Just a thought...
You can take a look.
"No, thanks."
- What?
You were better in my head.
"Oh, Rose!"
Sugar!
"Maybe I just had too much to drink, that's all."
No!
No!
"It's not you, it's me."
"You see, I don't feel anything, isn't that great?"
"I never thought about what I would feel, I was only thinking about YOU."
"I only wanted to make YOU happy, I never thought I was good enough for you."
"Oh, but you are good enough for me, Rose."
You are!
You are!
"I know, I know, but Alex... you're not good enough for me."
Okay...
Oh!
"She's with Alex now, Henry."
"- Oh, God."
- I can't believe it.
"I don't know what it is, my head or my stomach."
You need anything?
Drink this!
C'mon!
Lie down!
- I think I might have Chinese food poisoning.
"- Here, give me your coat."
"I ordered Szechwan chicken but they brought beef, except I think it was a CAT."
Cat!
?
- I'm so dizzy.
- Easy!
"All right, I'll be in at 11:00."
"- Oh, Polly..."
- Hmm?
I've got to check the laundry.
Could you keep an eye on reception for me?
Sure.
"Polly, Polly, where Mr. Fawlty?"
I don't know.
What's the matter?
I have money for him.
"He win on horse, but big secret, sh!"
"Mrs. Fawlty, sh!"
"Well, give it to me."
I'll give it to him.
"Good afternoon, Miss Gatsby."
"Good afternoon, Miss Tibbs."
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
"First they give me a room without a bath, then there's no lavatory paper!"
Would you like some of ours?
We keep an extra supply.
Yes.
Would you like some of ours?
Hello!
"Girl, there's no paper in my room."
Why don't you check these things?
"That's what you're being paid for, isn't it?"
- We don't put it in the rooms.
- What?
We keep it in the lounge.
In the lounge?
Dammit!
"come on, get in the truck quick!"
Come on!
"Easy, easy, there's space for everybody!"
Quick!

"To the left, left!"
- They're not animals!
- Are you American?
"- Listen, Sgt..."
- You better get in.
I'll wait for the next.
"There are no more trucks, Madam."
We won't be back for quite a while.
- But you told them!
- Do as you wish.
We're leaving!
"You know, grappa?"
I could use some now.
"Hey, stop!"
Stop!
"Hello, gorgeous, wanna ride with us?"
A blonde!
Lets have a look!
- Not bad...
"- Not bad, really."
- Are you blonde all over?
Ask her if she wants some candy to suck on.
How about 8 inches of sugar cane?
I'll take care of that.
What's your name?
She's pretty.
A ghost from the past.
"Come and have a drink with me, John, I don't feel like being alone."
"I'm sorry, Mr. Bourne, I'd like to, but I can't."
On duty.
Okay.

Really sick?
You really do look sick.
Mushrooms...

I gave it to you to use it at times like this.
Since we're close...
"Don't feel burdened, and do as I say, okay?"
"She can,t stand me."
"No, you,ve got her all wrong."
"She only seems cold and serious because she,s a scientist."
"She,s not really mean."
"You don,t think so?"
What did you do today?
Today?
Let me see.
I tested steering wheels and pens.
How was it?

Then what's the problem?
"I'm not coming back, Mrs. Shaw."
"Hi, sweetheart."

He's been calling all morning.

- A glass of juice maybe.
What a little asshole.
What a stupid little boy.

I'll get a room though so I don't have to commute.
"I brought my teddy bear pajamas, some cookies and a glass of water   sloshing about in my bag."

We have bigger problems than Mrs. Bloom.
Jessi starts back at school today.
I sort of levitated.
Show me how.
I will.
She's the one who attacked me.
I know Lori will never forgive me.
You have to earn forgiveness.
"""She Could Be You. "" What?"
The two of you used to play that song all the time.
D4.
It's not there.
It's a Latnok ring.
All the members received rings.
It was a way of identifying one another.
And you're Latnok?
Yes.
I got accepted into a music program in New York.

"Hey, what's up ?"
"Look, we were just dancing."
"And what, her ass just happened to fall into your hands ?"
"No, it was-"
"- You were dancing with Snookie, I was dancing with Nikki."
The music was going and-- l thought we were having a good time.
Look.
There's nothing between me and Nikki anymore.
-Come in.
"-Thank you, my dear."
-You're going to break your eardrums.
-Enjoy it.
-Thank you.
"You're young, I'm old and sick."
What we'll do in the next few months will make history.
It's never been done before.
Not even your father would dream that such a thing could be possible.
Frank Pentangeli is a dead man.
You don't object?
He's small potatoes.
What's up?
We got company?
What's going on?
Michael Corleone is here.
Where is he?
He's in your den.
You better hurry.
He's been waiting a half hour.

We were so relieved...
In my home!
In my bedroom where my wife sleeps!
Where my children come to play.
In my home.
I want you to help me take my revenge.

- Two orthree days.
- Two orthree?
"And if it rains, what will the dearthing wear?"
.

Two orthree days?
But it's just a small package.
Your grandson Peppe?
- You're talking about Peppe?
- Do you know him?
"Peppe said, I quote:"
"""If my grandma comes, tell her she can't make sweaters,"""
"""she's gotta do fried dough, 'cause she does 'em great."""
"But he doesn't like sweaters, make him a dessert."
"Making sweaters isn't foryou, Peppe said so."
- Make scarves.
Let's see what's down there.

Bled out.
He knew there was a gun hidden down here.

"But whatever they're looking for, it's on this, so can you?"
"Yeah, I'm on it, I'm on it."
"Ith that's it, thank you."
-You're welcome.

Everyone knows CPS took your kid.
Whole town knows.
Shut your mouth now.
-They don't know about Galveston.
That's enough.
-He fucking left us.
Stop.
-Don't tell me what to do.
It wasn't my responsibility to take care of everything.
Take care of Wes while you boozed up down there.
"Alright, come on."
"3 weeks dad, 3 whole weeks you were gone."
"Admit it, you wanna drink yourself to death."
"Cause when Duncan found you, you were gonna leave us for good, weren't you?"
I got a car.

Tom?
This guy says that Saul and Lena closed the place early last night.
"This morning, the place was for sale."
There was no answer from them this morning.
- Does this kid know anything?
- He's as surprised as we are.
- Let's run by their house.
"- You find anything, let me know."
- I like them old haoles.
"- Mahalo, brah."
"Thanks, brah."
Saul said they were taking a vacation.

Where's Zack?
Jail.
Boom!
Just won the office pool.
Okay.
"Let's take a gander at the old money maker, huh?"
"Oh, six centimeters."
Shouldn't be long now.
But Zack's not here.
"Olivia, help."
Don't worry about it.
I know people at every precinct in this town:
"If they don't let him go, they're going to read about it in tomorrow's front page."
"Yeah, she's gonna get arrested, too."
Hey.
I slept with her.
I don't care.
I can't believe that
Zack's not going to make it.
Akan!
"Akan, open this fucking door, do you hear me?"
I got her all dolled up in the back of my truck downstairs.
I'm gonna rip your fucking lungs out!
"You'll go far, Henry, unlike this piece of shit."
"Hey, Henry."
Put your gun down.
It's all good.
"Hey, hey, hey, hey."
"Peaceful, peaceful."
Chill out.
Calm down.
Now I've shared something with you.
I need you to share something with me.
Where's Akan going?
Now that is my ego talking to yours.
"What do you want... higher self, ego?"
"Higher self, ego?"
- Higher self!
- Higher self.
Yeah.
Okay.
Akan's convoy are taking the girl to his base.
"Oh, shit."
Let me handle this.
Let me handle this.
"I'm sorry you're upset, okay?"
- Henry and I are gonna go deal with Akan.
- Henry?
Who is Henry?
You wanna go on the bike?
You can go on the bike.
"- Maggie, why don't you go?"
"- No, I'm good..."
"- I don't have a partner, so."
- We'll all be your partner.
"- Come on, we're all doing it."
- I'm keeping score in my head.
"You said you were open to loving some games, right?"
- Come on.
"- Play the game, Mags."
"Get up there, let's game it up."
- [overlapping chatter]
"- All right, games."
- Yay.
- There she is.
Team of one.
Team of one.
Let's do it.
- All right.
- Here we go.
"You're gonna crush it, Mags."
"Okay, okay, shh, shh, shh."
"Okay, everybody's forgotten about you!"
"You're all alone, you're all alone!"
Your only friend's an old man!
Nobody cares about you!
- All by yourself.
- You're lonely!
- It's just you!
- You're lonely!
- Nobody wants you!
- You're lonely.
And everyone forgot about you.

He's a trainee at the garbageman school on Ward's Island.
He did time a couple of years ago...

The black Cadillac-
"Uh, NewJersey plates."
RWN-264.
I know that one cat.
We saw him outside the Pike Slip Inn the other day.
[Cloudy] I wanna get a blouse like that for my girlfriend... but I want you to model it for me.
Better not let my husband hear that.
I don't care if he hears it.
Will you do it for me?
Okay.
How much you gonna pay?
- Fifty dollars an hour.
- Fifty an hour?
I'll do it... 200.
[Cloudy] Nah.
Can't afford it.
I'll call you later.
All right.
Bye-bye.
"Hey, it's 1:30."
I didn't expect you till 2:00.
- [Angie] You work around here?
- Yeah.
Across the street.
[Jimmy] That's the third time he's come here this week.
[Cloudy] Mm-hmm.
- You got anything on this building?
- The building's clean.
"Granville, far be it for me to try to influence a h--hunchback."
Come on.
"There she goes, the grocer's delight!"
-
"- Granville, have you got that mike fixed up?"
-
- Just a minute.
The nurse is there.
I want to catch her before she goes in.
I've got an idea.
-
- Come on.
-
- Here you are.
"Thank you, Igor, my faithful servant."
This is what I'm going to say.
"""Hello, sh--sh..."
"Hello, sh--sh..."
"Hello, folks!"
"""This is Ark--Ark--Ark..."
This is Ark...
"This is Ark--Ark..."""
"I don't think I'd b--better do this, Granville."
Did you notice a little s--stammer?
"Nothing worth talking about, no."
"But you'd better let me do it, just in case."
You look more like a duck's jockey.
Disc jockey!
Disc jockey!
"In my case, a slipped disc jockey!"
Don't worry.
"Listen, don't start it off till I give you the signal."
"Sorry, it does that sometimes."
My wife got the good car.
"So, how you doing?"
"Well, Stan, we need to talk."
I know.
I can't do this anymore.
What?
"You're nice and sweet, Christine, but..."
I just don't think this is working out for me.
What?
Why?
"Well, you know, I haven't been around much, and..."
I think you just might be a little too fast for me.
Fast?
It's been three years!
I got a kid that goes to this school.
I got to think of my reputation.
Your reputation?
If anything...
I helped your reputation.
Giving some of this is the best thing that ever happened to you.
You did me.
You know it!
You made me a mix tape.
"Oh, my stomach hurts."
"Yeah, I would die."

It's a great neighborhood.
"Good morning, Miss Simpson."
- How are you doing this morning?
- Fantastic.
"In English, please, Nadine."
You're not going to ask me about Gary?
Yes.
Your Internet romance.
How's it going?
- Yesterday he said he loves me.
- What?
Really?
"He signed off, "" Love, Gary."""
"Nadine, you mustn't read too much into that."
"Americans use the word ""love"" very casually."
"We say ""I love you"" like you say ""Good-bye."""
""" Hi."
You must be Gary.
I'm Nadine.
"I came all the way from Brazil to see you only."""
Just to see you.
- Okay.
Just to see you.
- Right.
"""I know that I don't know you very much."""
- Very well.
- Thank you.
No.
I don't know you very well.
"- "" But you don't know me either."""
- Ei-ther.
""" But I am sure, deep inside my heart... that you are the person of my life."""
"You know, you don't say ""person of my life."""
Blow!
You too!
"Oh, turn the lights out before you go, Stoker!"
"You made a mistake, Stoker!"
A bad mistake!
I don't mean about Nelson!
"Three, four wins and nobody will remember what happened!"
"But I paid for something tonight, and I didn't get it!"
"I don't like that, Stoker!"
I didn't know anything!
Tiny didn't say anything!
He know he was to go in the third!
I give Tiny the dough an hour ago!
- Fifty bucks!
- I didn't get any...
- I bet you didn't!
- Hold it!
You get dressed!
We'll talk about this later!
- Anything else?
- A couple of cans of soup!
- What kind?
- Vegetable!
"Oh, and two bottles of beer!"
That'll be $ 1 !
13 with three cents to the governor!
That's $ 1 !
16!
One-sixteen!
You ought to throw in a floorshow!
There he is!
"All right, Stoker, we'll talk!"
- Hello?
"- Hi, this is Gigi."
- Gigi?
- Gigi Phillips.
- Huh?
"- I, um had the dentist pen."
Right.
Hey.
How you doing?
- I'm really sorry to bug you.
- That's okay.
You had some really good insights and I wanted to ask you a question.
"Okay, look, now I need to be harsh with you."
"Conor's never gonna be interested in you, Geege."
"No, I know."
This is about Jarrad.
Jarrad.
So we meet at happy hour and he's completely charming...
"Hey, give me two seconds, okay?"
"Two seconds, hold on."
Let me guess.
He said:
"""The only thing happy about this hour is you."""
He might have used some derivative of that.
[CHUCKLES]
"So he says he's going to call, but then he gives me his card and he says..."
"Oh, he's not interested."
- You don't even know if he's called.
"- Oh, did he?"
No.
- But I honestly think he's expect...
- Okay.
"Okay, guys, let's fly this thing out of here."
To where?
We would never get it far enough away.
Maybe the Waverider can.
"Rip, we need..."
Rip?
Rip!
What are you doing?
"I'm flying the Waverider into the sun,"
- with the meteor on board.
- And you on it.
I guess this is good-bye.
"It's been a pleasure, Captain."
"Likewise, Dr. Palmer."
"But you brought us all into this, man."
"Which is why I'm doing this alone, Mr. Jackson."
I'll have no one else die for my choices.
This isn't going to bring Snart back.
I don't want to lose another friend.
"I appreciate that, Mr. Rory."
"I must say, it's been an honor to serve as your cap..."
Rip.
Daddy?
Miranda.
I...
Where...
"I'm still here, Captain."
"I know you are, Gideon."
May I share something with you?
I'm not ready to die.
Me neither.
Which reminds me...
Drink.
Passports.
"Yes, I know,  but..."
If we had the passports
She would understand who we are.
"I repeat that he is our king, Nicolas III, king of Belgium."
What will we do about our king?
What did the Queen want us to grasp?
Its vitality...
And his spontaneity.
And smiles.
And smiles.
We need an official version of this story.
Why not the truth?
Ready?
His Majesty?
What a relief to hear his voice.
"Yes, he is here, right next to me."
"No, I mean, that's right..."
"There is Mr. Moreau over here, I take it."
Ready.
His Majesty?
"Yes...  yes, we're fine."
And you?
"I mean, kingdom?"
And the political situation?
"Yes, I understand..."
The king is fine.
We have a small problem.
"Yes, you too, I imagine..."
Excuse me if I stop...
"No, we are not in Istanbul."
This was not the job.
I got business to finish.
You stay here.
How do I get to the Oval Office?
Take the stairs to the ground floor..

There's an air strike coming!
Get them out of here.
Go!
You heard the man!
Tour's over.
I didn't sign up for this nuclear bullshit.
I'm gonna go and I'm gonna get the money myself.
Hey!
Hey!

I choose the pen!
Come here.
Get up.
Up!
Put your hand..

How's your leg?
How about you?
"Fine, mama."
I'm fine.
[Speaking Greek]
Your Uncle John passed by to visit me.
"Oh, really?"
When?
Last month.
Too tight?
No.
"Mama, you have to stay off it."
You can't go up and down the stairs.
You have to give it a rest.
Ok.
"Mama, I could take you somewhere where you would be safe and wouldn't be alone."
There would be people around.
You wouldn't be sitting here listening to a radio.
[Speaking Greek]
You understand me?
"This is my house, and I'm not going no place."
"Dimmie, you worry for something."
"No, mama."
You are not happy.
"Tell me, what is the matter?"
"Mama, I'm all right."
"I'm fine, really I am."

It's all accounted for. 15-8's got it.
"You put in a good day, fellows."
There is one other thing.
I hate to bring it up but you'll have to cut down on the personal calls at the office.
But we weren't even there to make any calls.
What's the matter?
Sorry.
I...
That's haven't been honest with you about a couple things.
Okay.
I lied to you about babysitting my brother the other night.
That guy at church was Tim Riggins.
Mmm-hmm.
We have kind of a history together.
"Okay, what kind of history?"
"Get the door, Brian."
Hey.
"Hey, I just came by to say that I'm sorry."
Come in.
"Hey, Noannie."
Didn't Mom ban her?
"Noannie, please."
"Just watch your show and be easy, all right?"
I just feel so bad about everything.
I really cannot believe you had to apologize like that.
I wish we could erase that whole day.
It's gonna be okay.
This whole thing gonna blow over.
I was really worried about you.
Smash always lands on his feet.
Hello?
Who is that?

"No, I don't."
Who is this?
"Noannie, give me the phone."
You guys are jerks.
Did you have to put me with the massage ads?
"Well, it was either that or the page with the personals, so..."
This page gets a lot of action.
"Yeah, I guess you're right."
"Hey, have you spoken to Anna lately?"
Yeah.
Okay.
"All right, Mary, I'll talk to you soon."
Thank you.
Bye.
PAIGE:

There is a difference.
BETH:
"Hey, how did you get Aunt Linda to sew these dresses in two weeks?"
PAIGE:

PAIGE:
"No, she didn't."
LAURA:
No?
BETH:
What's the...?
Why the big rush to get married?
PAIGE:
Because I am not having my wedding during a gross Baltimore winter and I am not waiting till spring.
You are so pregnant.
PAIGE:

Flirting in college.
It really helped a lot.
And look at Jonny's bone structure.
- Yeah.
- Jonny has the greatest face.
- Look at that.
"- Oh, mama."
He's creepy.
People keep asking me if Jonny's related to Josh Hartnett.
"- Oh, my gosh."
- Really?
"I don't even really know the answer to that, I assume not."
"I don't think he is, but I can see why they're asking."
- Just because they look...?
- What is that?
"Yeah, they have similar bone structure."
- came all this way to see me.
- Freddy!
"[ Ray ] You see, Officer, in Garrison... when the car you're gonna tag has got a P.D.A. sticker..."
"I'd advise you to think to yourself, """"Hey, that's one of the good guys."
"I think I'll go catch me a bad guy."""
"If we didn't pull over P.D., there wouldn't be any violations in this town."
The problem in this town ain't the people that live here.
It's the element that visits.
"Is this a new car, Ray?"
It's nice.
We didn't recognize it.
"Come on, Freddy, I wanna go home."
Tell this cupcake to heel.

But this time I'm gonna do it right.
That is a nice rock.
That was my great-grandmother's.

I know that you collect these things.

- Good shot!
- What happened to Hannah?
"- Erm, I think you blew it when a twelve year did beat you."
I fucking slipped!
He's talking to a load of Northwood lads.

Hi!
"Mom, is that bacon?"
That's bacon.
What are you doing?
I'm not eating it.
"Well, not yet anyway."
Do you know I haven't had bacon for over 30 years?
Because it goes against our beliefs?
"Well, I'm just not sure what our beliefs are anymore."
"Mom, what do you mean?"
You're a Muslim!
What if I'm a Muslim because I was married to a Muslim?
"Well, um, how long have you been feeling this way?"
"I've been on a date, I've had wine, and something else Ann put in my drink, and now I'm thinking about trying bacon."
"- No, don't do it!"
- Hey!

Brian Krakow happens to be waiting in my living room... and I don't know what you're doing with him!
Nothing!
Nothing!
We're just friends.
"Yes, when Kyle's not around, you've been using him."
You are lecturing me about using Brian Krakow... when he is so obviously in love with you and you totally use him!
- Brian Krakow is not in love with me!
- That's not what Rayanne Graff says.
You know what?
"Yes, of my aunt, by the one of the rent."
"One does not worry about the rent, we can reach an agreement."
That is what worries me.
By the way.
"It has called a friend of yours, a certain Sandro."

- Coag looks good.
Lytes are normal.
- Blood pH 7.37.

- How's the patient?
- He hasn't gone into DIC.
There are reporters crawling all over.
- What's his temp?
- Eighty-five degrees.
- He's not warming up enough.

His heart won't take it.
We could bypass him and warm his blood directly.

Why?
It's just as good a check as Mrs. Ryan's.
"I know, It's just that I've got to use that check for a transaction after business hours."
Nobody'll honor a personal check.
"Oh, I see."

"And, you know, I didn't - we didn't have our parents already."
"So, it meant my being alone."
"And if my sister wanted to go out, she went... and I was left alone... at home."
"You know, it was a - It wasn't a good situation."
- When did Max die?
- Nine days ago.
- Pardon?
- Nine days ago.
What was wrong with him?
"He fell, and we don't know what's wrong with him, what happened yet."
- But he died.
- Yes.
My best friend.
[Woman] Claire?
- Are you leaving?
- Okay.
The nurse is here.
L-l-I just want her to have a look at you.
"She's just, um -"
- She's not doing very well.
- Do you have any pain?
- Pardon?
- Do you have any pain?
"What do you mean, ""Do I have anything?"""
Pain.
Do you have any pain?
Pain?
[Chuckles]
"Yes, I have pain from what I heard... about Max."
- Do you have headache or something?
- Max
"- Max is gone, is he?"
I don't care who it is.
I'll cream him!
I wish you the best of luck.
Let's go!
We'll join forces and clobber him!
Roger!

Dimension...
Dangaioh...!
Think you can get away with this?
You bunch of space trash!
Flame Arrow!
No...!
What...
What's going on?
!
Why doesn't he fall?
The Flame Arrow doesn't affect him.
What do you mean?
He seemed to absorb it.
Dangaioh's attack doesn't faze him...?
Burning Blow...!
Good!
Burning Blow is out of control...
Stop it!
It's too dangerous.
What is that thing?
Condition indicators dropping...
The three of them are unconscious.
Prepare the shock pulses!
Put all your efforts into the pilots' life support systems.
"So, this is the power of our enemy...?"
"With all the cross- contamination, we'll be lucky to pull a single print off of any of this stuff."
"Do what you can, okay?"
It's all we've got to go on.
Yeah.

JOHN:
"When he was five years old,"
I asked my son Steve what he wanted to be when he grew up.
"""I want to be a cop, Dad, like you."""
I told him to... be anything but that.
STEVE:
"Let's change this out, huh?"
Oh...
I'm sorry.
You all right?
Mm-hmm.
This could've done with some more stitches.
What are you laughing at?
Uh... (laughs)
I was just thinking back to the last time I needed stitches.
All right.
Billy and I were on an operation in Kabul...
Yeah.
"...and, uh,"
I got this nasty cut on the back of my head.
"It was gonna take, like, 15, 20 stitches to close it up, but all we had were Band-Aids."
(chuckles) Yeah.
What'd you do?
Billy just grabbed these huge clumps of hair around the cut and tied them together.
(laughs)

I have to get out of here.

No wonder nobody wants to touch me.
"Al, you scared me."
Scared you?
Comin' out of the coffin.
What about me?
You know how I feel about dead people.
I'm a coroner.
Yeah.
"Well, no."
"Actually, you're a mortician."
[ Chuckles ] It's 1 957.
"Uh, you're in Riven Rock, Massachusetts."
And in little towns like this sometimes they appoint the local mortician as the coroner.
This is horrible.
"Hey, I wouldn't mind sitting out this leap either."
"Well, maybe you can."
"I don't think I need you on this one, Al."
What do you mean you don't need me?
I don't need you.
What?
"On my bus, in my bible."
"Thanks for subbing tonight, Eddie."
"My pleasure, coach."
"Eddie, you want to ease up on the pedal there?"
I got it all under control.

"What are you gonna do, shoot me?"
Don't need to.

Aren't you the P.E. teacher?
Not really.

Yes.
We're having wiring problems in the building.
Do you mind if I come in and check your baseboard outlets?
Are you kidding?
"7:30 at night, and you're gonna take outlet inventory?"
"Oh, well, if you're eating, I..."
I could come back later.
It won't take but a few minutes...
"No, if you're gonna crawl around the floor and count little holes in the wall, come on in and get it over with."
Come on.
Okay.
Who was that?

That's good.
Mmm.
Ahh!
[Whispering] I love you.
I have always loved you.
[Ticking]

Ya haven't got a warrant.
You just want to get me in some kind of trouble.
I thought that was you.
"It's you, right?"
Yeah.
I guess it is.
Yeah.
Natalie Teeger.
"Oh, my God."
I hate to bother you.
Would you mind?
We really do have to...
"Oh, sure."
We should head up.
"Mr. Monk, do you mind?"
The Captain probably...
Mr. Monk?
Bend.
Bend a little.
"Bend, please."
Bend.
I never know what to say.
I know what to say.
Did I write those letters?
Of course I wrote the letters.
My name is on them.
I'm not going to deny that.
Did you bother reading them?
"Yes, sir, I have."
"Well, then, you know I didn't threaten anybody."
I offered the producers and the lottery commissioners some constructive criticism.
I don't know why they don't listen to me.
I know more about this lottery system than any living American.
"I'm sure you do, Mr. O'Dwyer."
We were doing so well.
She never even got to see my penis.
Ta-da!
Who wants some more coffee?
"Thanks, yeah."

Let me help you.
Nice to see that the gals are getting along.

"Who are you, Fred Flintstone?"
This trip to India sounds fun.
"Yeah, I think it will be."
Are you concerned your parents might not approve of Leonard?
A little.
They're very old-fashioned.
"Well, I wouldn't worry about it."
"It's not like you guys are getting engaged, right?"
"Oh, God, no."
We're not there yet.
Not engaged.
Very interesting.
I have to tinkle.
You've been in there a lot tonight.
Are you okay?
Yes.
Are you writing a book?
Why are you getting upset?
I'm not upset.
Maybe you're upset.
What's up with you?
Bernadette?
I can't do this anymore!
We're moving to a new home.
Why?
I thought you loved to live by the sea.
I do.
Beautiful sea breezes.
I can imagine the view ofthe clear blue sky... and the deep blue sea.
Great!
Packyour things and wait for me.
I'll be here.
Why didn't you leave Hong Kong immediately?
What stopped you?
- Are you the new janitor?
- Yes.
You're doing a lousy job.
This is a fire escape.
"Look, there's garbage everywhere."
What if there's a fire?
I can't fy away like a phoenix.
I pay my monthly maintenance fee.
"If I find you goofing offagain, I'll file a complaint."
Don't leave any garbage here.
Move it all away.
Shit!

"Yes,Jenny."
Are you with a friend?
"Yes, he's my old football buddy."
We grew up in the same squatter area.
Yes.
He's...

That's what you called each other?

Hold it.

"But the kids who want to get education have a right, too!"
Yeah!
Yeah!
Don't you understand?

You can't accomplish anything by shutting kids out of their school.

That's a wrap.

Good night.
There's not a day in my life that I don't feel like a fraud.

I don't know anyone who hasn't felt that.

Hello?
In here.
Hi.
How did your day go?
So far you haven't shown me a thing.
"You keep shootin' your mouth off, I'm gonna knock you right into next week."
- Knock it off.
- Don't tell me to knock it off.

This stuffll take a seven-to-one hit on the street.
"By the time it gets down to nickel bags, it'll be 32 million."
"Thank you, Howard."
Take what's left there with you and good night.
Uh-uh.
You must have dropped it.
Thank you.
Is everything there?
Yes.
I didn't touch anything.
Thank you.
Where are you going?
Home.
May I walk you there?
I've got nothing to do.
"Yes, but I'm going home."
"Yes, of course."
Good.
I couldn't live without dancing.
And I love watching it.
Do you like dancing?
I guess so.
"Well, yes."
But I've never gone to see anything.
"What else do you do, besides dancing?"
"I love traveling, and I go to the Cinematheque a lot to see films."
Recently I've discovered silent cinema.
It's my favorite.
Silent cinema?
Yes.
What do you do when you go out?
I don't go out.
You must go out sometime.
"I was looking after my mother, but she died two months ago."
I'm sorry.
"My mother died too, but a long time ago."
"Well, we're here."
She could be fucking him right now.
She could be fucking him in Ojai or in a fucking sailboat for all I know.
I appreciate your candor.
I'm both embarrassed and illuminated.
You did nice work today.
Are you gonna be with us tomorrow?
- Every day.
- Indeed.
"Yeah, have you seen Ryan today?"
"Um, he's with his dad dealing with some heavy shit."
"But it's not about you, so don't sweat it."
I don't.
Goddamn right you don't.

Alvey:
Nate!
"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
"Hey, what are you doing?"
Sparring with Juan.
"No, no, you're..."
"No, no, you're not."
Come here.
I said no sparring until your head's right.
I'm fine.
You're not fine.
You're not fine.
You're not cleared.
"You're not fucking training until you are, okay?"
Done.
She died when Dirk was 13.
Cancer.
"I was working three jobs, so it fell to Dirk to take care of her."
And he was a great kid.
He made sure Jane got her medicine.
"He helped her, cleaned up after her."
"But, you know, you watch somebody die, slow."
Waste away to nothing.
It does things to a person.
Horrible things.
I didn't know about his mother.
He-
- He wouldn't talk about her not even to me.
Lot of anger in that boy.
I'm sorry.
"We'd really like to pay our respects, Mr. MacGregor."
"Um, do you mind telling us where Dirk is buried?"
"Oh, he wasn't."
I had him cremated.
All of him?
"Well, I kept a lock of his hair."
"Oh, that's-"
- That's nice.
Where do you keep that?
"On my bus, in my Bible."
"Thanks for subbing tonight, Eddie."
"My pleasure, coach."
"Eddie, you wanna ease up on the pedal there?"
I got it all under control.

You're a bit strange yourself.

Can you play lacrosse?
You use this?
It's for throwing the ball.
This is no good.
You must control the ball.
Shoot at the goal.
"Oh, OK."
It's quite difficult.
I can't take this anymore.
Hey!

I need help!
Hey!
"please, help me!"
What am I to do?

Grab that.

- That's better.

Ate the whole box.
- He OD'd on Ding Dongs.

"Yeah, Dad."
"If David were a Chihuahua, that'd be more like it."
"Yes, that's true, D-III."
It's the defending champ Ice Hounds versus Newman's upstart orphan team calling themselves the Zenovators.
Lock him up safely until he comes to.
I'll lock him up.
"I'm only sorry you didn't have a dizzy spell, too."
Then I'd lock you both up at the same time.
Good old Din.
What's up?

Where is it?
Didn't you bring any with you?

Think I want to break out of a blooming pudding?
"Go on, get something big."
Jaldi!
"Up, Annie."
"Please, Annie."
"What are you doing, Din?"
"A large tool you asked for, sahib."
"Annie, come on, pull these blinking bars out for me."

Just maybe not so many of them.
And on separate occasions.
"And,like,when you're not there."
"Hey,beautiful."
Hi.
This is a surprise.
I hope it's okay.
I just...
I couldn't stop thinking about you.

"What,is he shipping out tomorrow?"
It smelled like you.
I'm kind of working.
I love that you're working.

Yeah.
Is that...?

"Director Kim, get back here, right now!"
"Director Kim, come here now!"
I'm not going to let this one go.
I'm serious.
I can't stand it when a person mistreats another.
Can't stand it?
So what?
"I still like you, even if you've done wrong."
I respect you as a director.
"Now, go and apologize."
I'm serious.
Go say you're sorry.
That's the right thing to do.
You apologize if you like.
Why should I?
Because you treated him like dirt!
You really won't apologize?
"If you don't, I'm going back to Seoul."
You won't?
"Okay, I'm leaving."
Let's go!
Seriously?
Back to Seoul?
What's gotten into you?
"Alright, I did wrong."
Let's stop this!
"No, you have to go and apologize."
What do you mean?
Let me free.
No way.

Come on.
Why are you being so stubborn?

But we are alive.
Why don't you be a little more sensible.

"Eh, well then?"
Officer Jeng?
I refuse!
You keep quiet.
You want me to charge you with bribery?
What?
"Well, bribery would just make one more charge."
It won't make much difference.
Huh.
"I wanna ask you, did you come from Wayne County?"
Huh?

"I've been around, in all parts of this area."
But not as far as a county of Wayne.

You got jealous?

Tell me more.
"So, Ivan, I mean, what a surprise."
You said that already.
"Oh, yeah."
"Uh, can I get you something to drink?"
"You know what I like about you, Jasper?"
You never welched on a bet.
I have never had to send Marcus over here to collect.
And I can appreciate that.
I can.
Is that yours?
You mind if I see it?

Must we go?
Doubt they'll notice if we never arrive.
They will notice.
Where's your corset?
And no stockings.
I'm against them.
But you're not properly dressed.
Who's to say what is proper?
"What if it was agreed that ""proper""Nwas wearing a codfish on your head?"
-Would you wear it?
N-Alice.
a corset is like a codfish.
not today.
Father would have laughed.
I'm sorry. I'm tired.Nl didn't sleep well last night.
Did you have bad dreams again?
Only one.
Never since I can remember.
You have to get me out of here!
I can not go back.
I know.
We're going to America.
Thank you.
I love you.

We will continue with the broad options.
Something will take us forward.

-Falou With him?
"I told all I know, but it is not great."
He gave me a double and Coca-Cola sandwich.
Yes?
I am here.
I will not let it go.
But it is so serious that I will tell you first.
We have tips from a cocaine package by which Christer was responsible.
Right?
-you Do not know?
This is an interview or a complaint?
I can know about the whereabouts of this package.
Yes?
Camilla Bjerke?
We will take you in for questioning and searching his apartment.

- Hey.
LAURA:
"Hey, Johnny."
KELLY:
How was the ski trip?
LAURA:
"Oh, yeah, it was fun."
- You knock them dead?
- I never got you out there.
That was always a big regret for me too.
- Does Greg Medavoy seem off his game?
- Why?
He seems a little depressed.
"- Yeah, he's got a domestic situation."
"- Oh, yeah?"
Do you want to go out for dinner?
"- Sure, what's the occasion?"
- No occasion.
"- Okay, your call."
- Tonight?
- Fine.
- I'll talk to you later.
See you later.
Martinez will be with you at arraignment.
We think you'll get a recognizance release.
He'll see you home.
It's better if you carry me down.
"Yeah, the chair nearly went over coming up."
Let's pick him up.
I like pain of every kind.
Needles through my nipples.
Needles in my back.
I've had two needle corsets.
"Blows of all kinds, with marks, without marks."
Slaps.
"Verbal humiliation, being scolded."
That sort of thing.
I can free my mind.

And simply enjoy.
Simply be myself.
It's wonderful.
I need it.
Bend over it.
Spread your feet.
As wide as you can.
Nice.

"- Yes, Master Walter."
Count out loud.
- One.
- Good.

I met my first husband when I'd just turned 15.
We were together 7 years before we married.
For me the marriage was like a death sentence.
In quotations.
He thought I was his property.
That's how he treated me.
He beat me when he was drunk.
Not when he's your dad and he acts like your diary is part of the collective unconscious.
Wait.
"Sorry, I keep thinking about people sitting on this couch talking about being sexually abused."
That's what makes it fun.
You're a good kisser.
Am I a manly kisser?
Do you want to go to my prom with me?
N.Y.U. has proms?
Shit.
I'm drunk.
I should be honest with you.
I don't go to N.Y.U.
- Where do you go?
Hunter?
- St. Anne's.
The high school?
How old are you?
- Old enough.
- Wait wait.
"You want me to go to your senior prom, right?"
You're 18?
"- No, junior prom."
- You're 17?
- 16.
- 16 years old?
But I'll be 17 in two weeks.
You're 16?
"Oh my God, oh my God."
Don't freak out.
I haven't been a virgin for almost a year.
I probably know more about sex than you do.
"I know plenty about sex, okay?"
"65,000 children."
That's more than are born in Denmark in a year.
Think of what that money could do.
You could really do something.
- What do you get out of this?
- Nothing.
I keep my good life.
I buy remission for my sins.
And we're almost family.
- Why are you doing this?
- I'm assuming you're interested.
"Yes, damn it."
Of course I'm interested.
"Jacob, stay here."
You'll get to know Anna better.
You could take out Helene for dinner.
I'm going to to Sweden with the twins.
We're going fishing.
"You're a strange man, Jorgen."
She has to eat.
She's a terrible cook.
"- Take care of yourselves, okay?"
"- We will, mother."
- Don't lose too much online.
- I won 235 dollars last night.
Congratulations.
Try and hang on to them.
- Mom did it up wrong.
- We can't have that.
There.
Hop inside.
Thanks.
Okay.
Are you moving in?
Just temporarily.
I think
I could get more more money for the house if I did some work in the backyard.
"Why are you telling me this, Peter?"
"Look, I don't want you to worry about these... decisions."
This is all temporary.
I'm not trying to...
Colonize our past?
"Well, I don't think I'd exactly put it that way, but yes, I don't want these decisions to be misunderstood."
Okay.
I won't.
"So... we're making this work, right?"
"Oddly, yes, we are."
I heard Cary is back with you guys.
"- Yeah, starts today."
- Oh.
He's a good guy.
Wish him luck.
"So, we'll need you out here until we get an office cleared out,"
- if you're all right with that.
- I am.
Good.
It'll just be a few weeks.
"Welcome back, Cary."
Whew.
AN:
Yeah?
"Um, is this FE Construction?"
Hello?
Who is this?
"The French are out of Rochefort, and we're the only English at sea."
We must let the flagship weigh anchor.
We are going for that fire ship.
Beat your drums to quarters.
"- Ponsonby, aim for the fire ship."
"- Yes, sir."
"Come on, every man of you!"
"My God, sir."
Look there.
Bring starboard guns to bear.
Hit her with all you've got.
Steady.
- Fire.
- Fire!
Get the wounded away!
- Open fire!
- Fire!
Get this fire out of midship!
Fire party!
Fire!
We'll go under the bows of the fire ship.
Wait!
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
- Ease your helm.
"- Aye, aye, sir."
Steady.
"Steady she goes, sir."
- Hard to starboard.
"- Hard to starboard, sir."
Stand by with grappling iron.
Now!
A dual role?
!
No.
You will play a cook!
A cook even in films?
!
"There are songs, I hope?"
"You're going to the in-laws' place, not for a role."
Why send me there?
Will you have me released?
Not the cop-house!
My in-laws!
They need a cook.
Wow!
My head on the block?
!
But they're Brahmins!
"You must play a Hindu cook, although you're a Muslim!"
And cook what?
Biryani?
And paya?
Remove the meat from the rice and the dish turns vegetarian.
Don't worry.
"There's a woman working there, Aunt Laxmi."
She'll take care if you tell her you're my friend.
Folks there must be highly educated.
If I speak...
"Only if you speak, that is."
What does that mean?
Is Babu your name?
"What was that ""Ba"" and ""Bu""?"
"Not numerology, is it?"
- You get 50?
For what?
- For facilitating.
Who's taking a bigger risk here?
He likes prison.
"You did bring the cash, didn't you?"
"Look, if this option is too expensive you can still always..."
Badger in the chow line.
"Conscience gets expensive, doesn't it?"
All right.
There's our boy.
Right on time.
- Go back.
- What?
"All right, all right, all right."
"So, what do you think?"
They see us?
"No, man, I think we're good."
Badger looks like he's gonna throw up.
Give me those back.
Just give them to me.
"Oh, no."
Where the hell is Jimmy?
Should've been here 10 minutes ago.
You think Jimmy is actually for real?
A guy who wants to be in prison?
There's more than one kind of prison.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
There he is...
Wait a minute.
"- Oh, no, no, no."
- What?
"Right now, I'd like to see the chain the dog"
Was wearing in the park.
Greta's leash?
Why?
Mm.
"Grasping at straws, I guess..."
Nothing for you to worry about.
"Well, OK."
Sure.
OTIS:
"How is she, Greta?"
AUDREY:
"Oh, fine."
Maybe a little more restless than usual.
[Snarling]
Here it is.
What's important about the leash?
"Oh, nothing probably."
"You know, I'm just checking on anything."
Do you have a headache?
Yeah.
"It's an occupational hazard at my age, I guess."
Probably a lot of sinus too.
There's a lot of dust in the air today.
"Well, let me get you some aspirin."
Oh.
"If you would, uh, think this will be better."
"If it's a little seltzer, if you'd dump it in a small glass"
"Of water, please."
Sure How about some coffee?
"Uh, no, no."
No thanks.
"And that, you know, makes me uncomfortable."
[SCOFFS]
"Well, just because I'm comfortable with myself doesn't mean I don't wanna fit in."
"- What, you wanna fit in with us?"
- Yeah.
"I mean, you guys could try and be a little nicer to me at school."
"- Okay, well, we could try."
- Thank you.
- Okay.
Good.
- Okay.
Good.
- This is good.
- This is good.
This is a tip for you.
A tip?
"No, Marly, that's not..."
"Oh, a hundred bucks?"
"Whoa, thank you."
Somebody's getting a haircut.
And a new pair of shoes.
"I'm not looking, I'm not looking."
I just wanna get my purse.
"I don't wanna see anything, or, God forbid, touch anything."
"It's okay, he's gone."
Ah.
"Well, I am leaving."
I wanna thank you for a particularly humiliating afternoon.
- Are you mad at me?
- Mad at you?
"No, that was great."
"I don't know, which part was my favorite?"
Marjukka.
Your dad's about to die.
Who's stroking your hair now?
Who's enjoying my happiness?
I hope he's better Than I would've been for you
My heart still sings for her
My red-haired girl she is
Although you're not by my side
Let my thoughts come to you
Silence!
"In front of this congregation, I'd like to apologize to you, Jesse."
Your childhood was ruined because I studied plastic bags.
"Forgive me, Jesse."
I love you.
Dad...
-What?
The fire devil...
I've settled my score with him.
Really?
I'll be damned...
Then I can die in peace.
Can lemma mm my hand?
"Yes, she can."
"Bye then, grandpa."
Nice to die when it's not raining.
What next?
"Take good care of Jemina, will you?"
-I will.
She likes you.
She's like her Mom.
And her Dad.
Your flame is burning bright
"The thing is, you don't know."
You don't know.
So stop saying that you know.
- Okay.
- [Knuckles Cracking]
"It's okay that you have moods, Clark."
I'm not afraid of the different sides of you.
I love all of you.
"The world is an ugly place, Martha."
"And it is full of brutish... cruel, nasty people."
[Sighs]
I heard something on the recording from Gaad's office.
Is he in more trouble?
He's probably gonna lose his pension.
Maybe even go to jail.
- You shouldn't feel sorry for him.
"- Well, how can I not?"
- Martha...
- This is tearing him apart.
Martha.
- Gaad is not your friend.
- [Click]
"[Gaad] Oh, come on, guys."
Martha's ugly.
[Men Laughing]
I'd have to be 10 scotches deep before I touch her.
[Agent] Eew. 10 scotches and a bag over her head.
[Click]
Bastards.
I know.
I know.
[Crying]
No more than five.
- I know a way in.
- No.
"No, your Abbess..."
- She doesn't need to know.
- She said they search every inch.
We can't.
There are inches Mother doesn't know about.
Ladies.
Everything all right?
Yeah.
This is...
Sister Marie.
- Miri.
- Since when do we bring strays home?
She's going to help hide our men at the Abbey.
Then she should be at the Abbey.
Why is she here?
She knows our plan.
I prefer not to let her out of our sight.
We'll need a car or a way to slow the Germans down.
The Abbey has a truck.
They take it to town on market days.
"I could ""borrow"" the keys."
When do you need it?
Walking freely is a privilege.
- Brilliant.
- Maybe now you will think twice before attacking.
Alfred's going to have to find a way out from the inside.
- How?
- I don't know.
He's going to need our help.
"Look, what do you want?"
"Look, I'll make any kinda deal with you."
What the hell do you want?
"Hey, listen, who put you up to this, huh?"
"That-that caputo guy, huh?"
Carmine caputo?
You're not gonna get away with it.
"Do me a favor, huh?"
Listen...
"Oh, Jesus Christ."
"You see the thing is, my friend needs the money you've taken out of his pocket all these years."
[Chuckling]
"Hey, hey punk, that's easy."
"Twenty, thirty thousand dollars..."
I'll give you anything you want.
"Just get me the hell down, ya hear?"
"Hey, hold it, hold it."
"Hold it, please."
Now where's your house?
"It's over in englewood, new Jersey... 26 ocean road."
How do I get in?
That's easy.
"I'll give ya key, huh?"
This one here is the front door.
The alarm system...
Be my guest.
Where's the safe?
"It's the first room, right behind the kitchen."
You can't miss it.
It's to the right.
What's the combination?
"No, wait a minute, okay."
"-Quick, what is it?"
-A little memento.
"We fly from such a great distance, with a noble mission."
and you steal in a supermarket.
That makes 3625 crowns and 50 hellers.
-Thank you.
-All right.
Hello.
What does this mean?
We can't figure out the process in which this works.
-Can you give us some advice?
-What is in the can?
Great.
But we can't see in there.
"Do you have matches, doctor?"
No!
"Jeez, it's petrol!"
Where did you get it?
This must go immediately!
-What if someone saw you?
-It was lying in front of the house.
Unattended.
"The man who owns this, saved a long time for it."
-Worked.
Went without food.
-Really?
Someone stole my car!
Someone stole my car!
Someone stole my car!
Someone stole my car!
Someone stole my car!
I've been saving all my life!
"Woof, woof."
Hello.
I've come to see Rose and Lily Starling.
I'm not to talk to papers.
I'm not to let no one in.
I'm not from the papers.
I'm from the Ministry of Information.
The Film division.
Film?
And then you went to Dunkirk?
We meant to.
But the engines stopped five miles out.
Broken bearing.
We never got there.
"But in the paper...it said, you got home troops."
This steam tug on it's way back gave us a tow.
Soldiers spilling' over the rails.
"So we pulled someone in, see."
Someone seen us docking' and put it in the paper.
They got the wrong end of the stick.
Didn't they?
"Dad said, we'd be a laughin' stock."
"Said, ""You mustn't tell the papers""."
But you write in the papers.
For the pictures?
Can Lily ask you somethin'?
Yes.
Have you ever met Robert Donat?
The famous actor?
No.
"No, I haven't I'm afraid."
Dad!
- We should all be drunk for this.
- Let's get really drunk.
- All right.
- Yeah.
You know what?
I'll get some beers.
- Come with me.
"- Wait, wait, wait, wait."
Let him go.
- Mmm.
- I don't know what happened.
- Mmm.
Mmm.
- Mmm.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
"Deandra, we've been at this for days now."
It's like you have no motor skills.
Just grab that bar and jerk it down behind your neck.
Hey!
How's the chip off the old block doin'?
"- Bobby, not now, okay?"
"- Hey, your old man ever tell you how we fought back in '61?"
"They billed it as ""Beauty Versus the Beast."""
Wasn't much of a fight.
First-round knockout.
- He went down like a...
"- Wait, wait, wait."
Hold on a second.
"What's goin' on with you, Thunderson?"
"What, are you trying to humiliate me?"
"Uh, I think you did that to yourself 40 years ago."
You know damn well you hit me after the bell.
Incidentally you might ask your daughter if she remembers seeing Mr. Dennings in her room that night.
"Look, he wouldn't have any reason in the world to go up to her room."
"I know, I realize, but if certain British doctors never asked, ""What is this fungus?"" we wouldn't today have penicillin."
Correct?
"When she's better, I'll ask her."
It couldn't hurt.
In the meantime....
That's okay.
"I really hate to ask you this, but for my daughter, could you please give an autograph?"
Of course.
Where's a pencil?
Right here.
She'd love it!
What's her name?
I lied.
It's for me.
The spelling is on the back:
Kinderman.
"You know that film you made, Angel?"
I saw that six times!
Really?
It was beautiful.
Thank you.
-'Bye.
-'Bye.
"Please, no!"
-Do it!
"-Please, don't!"
You bitch!
Do it!
"Please, no!"
Let Jesus fuck you!
"People, please, move out of the way, please."
Keep this door open.
"Come on, open the door."
- Bring him in.
Is he conscious?
"- No, ma'am."
"- Oh, my God."
- Calm down.
He's going to be all right.
He's going to be all right.
We'll cut him right here.
Gauze.
- That's good.
- On your left.
"Thank you, nurse."
"Dr. Simmons, take a look at this."
Heavenly father...
I know everything happens for a reason... so I'll just leave it in your hands.
Amen.
Excuse me.
I need somebody to talk to about my friend.
I'm worried about his condition.
What time you get off work?
I just want to discuss his condition.
Visiting hours are over.
Good night.
"You're doing much better, Mr. Reed."
Don't try to talk.
You need your rest.
"My name is Vanessa, and I'm going to take great care of you."
Understand?
Just push the button on the side of the bed... and I'll be there.
"- Oh, this is your car, right?"
- Yep.
See?
Fixed it.
Okay.
You're backing up?
Just fucking go straight.
"I took a precision driving class, Dan."
I think I know what I'm doing.
"Ma'am, we've lost Pierce."
I'm sorry.
We should have hired Navy SEALs instead of those two actual seals.
How do you lose a whole person?
"A cuff link I get, but not a person."
Okay.
She said she's losing her voice.
Just heard from a reporter who says Moyes thinks the White House hired lobbyists to destroy its own bill.
"- Oh, my God."
- Jesus.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
"She said you fucked up, Ben."
And I'm mad as hell that you put Gary in the shit.
You need to get him out.
"- She didn't say that, Gary."
"- Yes, she did."
"Everyone, shut your fucking holes!"
The president is not sick.
- You guys are.
You're parasites.
You're like an infestation of mediocrity.
I don't care if you're a 1950s radio broadcaster.
That hasn't changed.
You don't lose a steady hand.
"Except, back then it was control."
Now it's rheumatism.
"Ladies and gentlemen, we're in the oldest part of Amsterdam."
We're driving past the oldest buildings.
We're now going to sex theatre Casa Rosso.
We wish you a very good time.
Can we help?
"-That's nice of you, thank you."
I'm killing myself dragging my husband around.
He insisted on going on a holiday.
And it had to be Holland.
Wanted to see the old mother country?
Niels!
-Ab!
Wout!
He recognizes us!
-Of course.
Thank you very much.
Does your husband still enjoy a sex club?
He thinks it's beautiful.
He can't move well anymore.
He's had a stroke.
"But his brain's still working, isn't it?"
My sweetheart.
"Miss, help me, please."
Miss!
Shoot.
Shoot me.
Kill me.
Please.
(voice cracking):
including... my poor wife.
(creaky door opens)
"Oh, hi."
I need to switch rooms.
This guy is bumming me out.
I don't know if you have any singles open or...
Silence!
"Now that we have you, we don't need this frail, old man."
"Well, that was a stupid move."
You're all under arrest.
(dramatically):
For murder!
(surf rolling)
"Aw, this soaks deck."
"Hey there, Chief."
You mind if I pick up here tomorrow?
Say between 1:00 and 4:00?
"See, I'm a cable installer..."
"Good, because our cable is out."
We missed the last Mad Men.
You will fix our cable.
"Oh, this will be easy."
Good luck.
We've tried everything.
"Oh, so pirates couldn't fix their cable?"
That's right.
"Exactly, so let me do what I do."
Caw!
Caw!
PIRATE:
It is working!
You say that like there's only one problem.
God knows what Lance is going to come up with while you try to produce a mother out of thin air.
Pay the bill.
[line ringing]
"Hey, uh, I hope you're having a great Sunday because we got a big fucking problem."
Marjorie:
Okay.
How soon can you make it to Bridgeport?
Why?
Because I need you to be the rope.
Okay.
Who am I playing?
Pete's mom Maggie.
"Uh, isn't she, like, north of 50?"
"I just played your mistress a few years ago, Marius."
"What, now I'm your mother?"
"What is this, Hollywood?"
"Well, we're screwed if you don't."
Ohh.
Do you have any idea of her height?
No.
Oh.
Good.
I'll sit.
"Uh, need to be dark, and I'll need something that makes them not want to look too closely."
Okay.
"I need to know a few things about her, please."
I don't know much beyond her name.
"Well, figure it out."
- [phone rings]
- Shit.
Yeah.
Mukesh.
Come here.
I don't care what people will think of me...
But you will never be able to face anyone again!
Put the knife in me!
What?
You don't have to kill me!
Insert it in a little bit!
Sarika!
I'll break open the door!
He will kill both of us!
Good!
We will die together like star-crossed lovers!
I am warning you for the last time Sarika!
That felt good.
First class first!
It was never Johnny who betrayed me...
It has always been you.
"And today, you want to get away again."
Not this time!
This is Mukesh.
is Johnny there?
"Who, Karpov?"
Yes.
He took off.
To Mauritius.
The lucky fucker ran into a bag of cash!
Johnny!
"Brother, we have reached."
Where are you?
We have been waiting outside the train station.
Are you coming?
- What's going on?
- I just got fired.
"Oh, my gosh, are you serious?"
"Oh, don't act so shocked, Carrie."
"All the times I've watched ""All About Eve,"""
"and I didn't even realize you were ""All About Eve-ing"" me."
What are you talking about?
Me?
I didn't want to get you fired.
"I mean, I've been working my butt off to save your job."
Yeah?
"Well, nice work..."
Taking my assignment and all.
"Bennet, you vanished."
I couldn't reach you.
"And apparently, you were out partying."
So what was I supposed to do?
Not stab me in the back.
Thanks for being such a good friend.
I didn't mean to get him fired.
Oh.
- Who are you?
- I'm Dorrit...
Bradshaw.
I'm just waiting to meet my dad.
"Oh, I didn't realize Tom had kids."
"Yep, me and my sister."
Don't worry.
I won't be long.
I just need some money.
Got it.
"Don't tell him, but he's super easy to manipulate."
"What's this, then?"
It's not mine.
Isn't this your handwriting?
"I said, it's not mine."
You know anything about a Japanese man living in the village?
You're dripping water all over the place.
Answer me.
Do you know him or not?
Did you meet him?
Answer me.
You're scaring her.
Get out for a sec.
"Come on, this is serious."
It's you and me.
Daddy is a policeman.
I'll know if you lie.
Did you meet this man?
Tell me.
Tell you what?
Everything.
"Where you met, what you did."
Why should I tell you?
Because it's important.
What's so important?
"Answer me, girl!"
"I said, what's so important?"
What's so damn important?
What the hell is so damned important?
You don't even know what's important.
"Stop grilling me, goddamn it!"
Fuck!
What are you doing?
He just got out of intensive care.
"We should probably go visit the man, considering it's kind of our fault that he's in there."
"Man, would you quit saying that?"
It is not our fault.
You know what?
You're right.
It's your fault.
Hike.
Go long!
Come on.
I got a cannon over here.
"Further, further!"
Oh.
Ooh.
"Usually, I'm a big fan of physical comedy."
Pratfalls and what not.
Yeah.
When I heard that crunch...
"- Actually, it was still kind of funny."
- Yeah.
"Look, you know what?"
"We'll go visit him, give him a balloon, draw penises all over his cast."
He'll smile.
We'll be in the clear.
"Hey, Aaron."
You okay?
I'm not really sure.
"Well, he should be more than okay because he had lunch with..."
Liza Blue.
Liza Blue?
The porn star?
"Okay, first of all, that's not her real name."
"Yes, certainly I am."
Do you ever stop and think that some of this could possibly be your fault?
What?
What?
I was too permissive?
"No, no, no, no."
"I'm not talking about the liberal child-rearing sense, Mom."
You blame everybody but yourself.
"You go out of your way, it's me, it's Kevin, it's Dad."
Where were you in the picture?
Do you ever think about that?
I don't see any ocean out there.
This is a terrible place to come to.
Please!
Please!
Just one minute!
One minute!
It's for my little girl.
Thank you so much.
You're so kind.
This must happen every night.
"Yeah, it's like ""Sophie's Choice"" in here."
What do you need?
I need a grass Hawaiian skirt for a hula.
"There's miriachis, which would be Mexico..."
Coconut cup?
Closer...
Ukelele...that's a good sign.
Sorry.
"No, don't tell me that."
Don't tell me that.
"Look, I'm sorry."
Where did the husband spring from?
He had left her?
Left her where?
A husband is no baggage to be carried around!
He's left on a pilgrimage.
That's wonderful!
A thorn out of my path!
But he will return.
How's that?
He has a return ticket.
God!
I'll have the railways cancel his ticket!
I want Laxmi!
I've no interest in life without Laxmi anymore!
Has Kishan paid you his rent?
Not in the last 6 months!
Haribhai?
I'm in a hurry...
See you later.
Look after my connection;
I'll go after the collection!
Who's throwing the litter around?
That's no litter...
Siraj!
What are you doing here?
And what's this?
Have you left Grand Hotel?
Yes.
This set-up is my own.
Have you bought it then?
What's that?
A Hindu name?
"How you doing, Ed?"
Ooh.
Terrible.
I feel like that drill was driving right through the top of my head.
It might be a good idea at that.
Let out that beer you slopped up last night.
"- Quit riding me, will you?"
- I ain't even started on you yet.
- Come on.
Let's eat.
"- No, Frank, I couldn't."
"Come on, do you good."
You gotta eat.
- I got just the thing to straighten you out.
- What is it?
Some nice ice-cold oatmeal smothered with lard.
Go get some more.
Yeah?
Let's get some more.
Come on.
"Tomato juice, eh?"
Hmm.
"Well, next best thing in the world for a hangover."
Yeah?
"Well, what's the best?"
Heh.
Laying off of the booze entirely.
What time did he roll in last night?
"Oh, I wouldn't know that."
- I never check up on me boarders.
- Your daughter's checking on him.
"Somebody's who's in on the con, lying to recruit players."
"It's as good as it gets, boss."
"Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs!"
Director.
Abbs.
What?
I got a hit on the prints.
The person... is in NCIS custody.
Leon!
You're cheating...
How do you brake?
"Oh, man, I know that look."
"Hey, homework starts as soon as they're done kicking my butt, Pops."
"Babe, I didn't see the harm."
Dinner's almost ready.
You and the kids get started without us.
"Come on, come on."
"Come on, come on."
Uh...
"It was my fault, not theirs, you know."
I-I pushed them into playing.
"Yeah, you're good at that."
Why did you do it?
The card game.
The kid you found dying in the street.
- No.
- How about not lying to me for once in your life?
I was trying to get out from under.
These guys-- they had my money.
Whose money?
The money for the... for the shop?
The money you loaned me-- it wasn't enough.
Yes.
Just a little shaken.
"Well, that's understandable."
"Don't worry, I got all the ones in the mall."
You're safe for now.
Ugh.
Blue looking for someone?
"Well, someone's found you."
[grunts]
Yah!
Ugh! Hello?
Is anyone here?
Are those things gone?
I thought they were going to get us.
You're safe.
I took care of them.
But now I need you to help take care of the school.
Look for any other kids that might be hiding.
We've all got to look out for each other now.
Stay strong.
You guys can do this. [grunting and groaning]
"Oh boy, oh boy."
It's good to see you.
I was so worried.
Are you all right?
Ugh.
We're fine.
"We tried calling you, but the armada must have knocked out all communications."
[grunting] [both] Huh?
Oh.
It's so good to see you guys.
"Likewise, buddy."
"Now, we are famed for our seafood."
You what?
See food?
What's 'see food'?
"Fruits de mer, sir - cockles, whelks, crabs, mussels..."
Them shiny pebbles?
"That's food, is it?"
"They are something of a delicacy, sir."
"Well, bung 'em in the bag."
And give me one of them pies with legs.
"No, no!"
Keep still!
"No, you're not even supposed to be in here."
Two points for straight in?
Wicked.
And one point if it goes in off the backboard.
Backboard?
Do you mean me?
What are we calling this game?
How about...
'Get the ball in the jug'?
Or 'Super juggy throw throw'?
Or...
Jugball?
"Yes, jugball!"
You're a genius!
We should play every day.
Make it company policy.
"Right, yeah!"
Brilliant.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
That would be brilliant.
Baber's story checked out.
You guys are free to go.
"Huh, technically, I'm supposed to say that."
Yeah.
Oh!
I'm sorry.
You can tell them about the fertilizer.
"Well, it turns out Baber, being the frugal shopper that he is, bought the cheap stuff,"
So what you have couldn't even blow up a dollhouse. [ They laugh. ]
Uh-huh!
"Could not blow up a dollhouse, could I?"
- Challenge accepted!
- No!
No!
No!
That's not what he meant!
Thanks for letting us go.
And for not waterboarding us or making us stare at the moon.
- O...
K.
- OK!
"Let's go, you guys"
I'll buy you an ice-cream sundae for your troubles.
"Oh, no!"
"Sweetie, I'm fine!"
"Yes, absolutely, I'm fine."
They dropped the charges.
"Well, there really were no charges, so I'm a free man!"
What?
"Oh, that's great!"
That's great news!
Amaar!
"Boy, what a night!"

Together forever.
Hey!
"So, what's up?"
I think we both may have said some things I might regret.
- Together forever.
"- Gosh, your eye is pretty."
"Look, I know you're upset, so..."
Why don't we just sit down and discuss this!
Then they ate me.
They're gonna do that all the way home.
I gotta go.
They were my ride.
Wait a minute.
"If they eat you, how is it that you're still here?"
Did you not say this was a true story?
Busted.
"You made it up, didn't you?"
I...
"Hey, look!"

And then there were three.
Who else wants to step up?
"I, too, have a terrifying tale to tell."
It was a dark and stormy night.
I meant the other Mario.
I've abandoned him to his fate.
- He behaved very badly.
Did you send him the bill?
- I don't think now's the time.
"Do you think, they'll condemn him, Sir?"
- It depends on who defends him.
If it gets into the hands of any old pettifogger..
- He's toast!
"Poor Mario, he was so nice!"
- Isolina!
"Noble Ophelia, get thee to a nunnery!"
"No thank you, Sir."
I don't smoke!
"- Oh, sorry."
"- Excuse me, sister."
These clients are serious.
- Yeah?
- They have a ton of money.
They have the fuel.
- Praise God..
May he always be praised.
- Always!
"Bye, Dad."
- We must go now.
"Yes, sister."
"Be strong, Isolina."
"Blessed sister, you don't know what it's like to have two husbands."
"Be brave, daughter."
You'll see that you too will find peace here.
I have great need of it.
PRISON
Ignore her.
She's been doing that all morning.
What a nutjob.
"So, how about you check with the local dermatologist."
See if there's any medical records on Heung-guk or that woman.
"Stop it, you tramp!"
I can't believe this.
"It's important, you idiot!"
The rash is the link here.
"Come on, hurry."
Stop it!
You could hurt somebody!

What?
In there.
In that room.
What are you talking about?
"The old woman got a shaman to do some ritual, but the lady refused."
That's why they all got killed.
Are you a family member?
"No, I'm not."
Then who are you?
Come with me.
Hey!

Nothing.

"You know, it's okay if you don't wanna be my girlfriend."

"Look, I wanted to say thanks for the other night."
You always drink like that?
I thought you left.
I did.
I am.
"Ryan, we're all set."
You ready?
"Hi there, Marissa."
What are you doing?
Nothing.
We're just hanging out.
"Oh, look, it's somebody's birthday."
I guess my invitation probably got lost in the mail.
It's my friend Summer's birthday.
Summer's birthday is not till Wednesday.
That's what I heard.
I don't know.
That was a guess.
You guys are up to something.
"Dude, what did you tell her?"
I didn't tell her anything.
I think the black turtleneck in August tipped her off.
"Okay, I was going for stealth, and also it's slimming."
We should really go.
Have fun at your party.
You should probably be off.
Newport social scene awaits.
"Oh, yeah?"
Why won't you tell me where we're going?
This is pretty far away.
I swear.
If I knew anything.
I can handle it from here.
Okay.
"So, if he loves Sara so much why did he lie to us about seeing his mother?"
"He didn't lie to us, he lied to his father."
Huh.
"Your parents are still married, aren't they?"
"Okay, so Jessica's angry enough to manipulate her son."
You think she's angry enough to go further?
Angry ex-wives don't leave their last vic on ice and a prayer card at the scene.
Angry ex-wives have friends.
Hello?
Are you alone?
Yeah.
What's going on?
I said I didn't want the FBI protection.
Did Dad have me followed anyway?
"I don't know, Marce."
Probably.
Are you with Ben?
No.
I slept in my car.
What are you talking about?
I'm scared.
"Look, whatever's going on, just come home."
I can't.
Not yet.
The FBI wants to talk to you.
They know you and Sara were fighting.
How do they know that?
I told them.
Turn the cannons on them!
Turn the cannons!
"Break them, Lo!"
What's happening?
I can't see what's happening to my boys!
What's happening to my boys?
"Major, give me your glasses."
There's a rebel.
Take him prisoner.
"Will you help me up, please?"
"Sir, could you tell me what your name is?"
Who you are?
I would like to see General Hancock.
Do you know where General Hancock may be found?
"I'm sorry, sir."
The general is down.
- He's been hit.
- No!
Not both of us.
Not all of us.
"Please, God."
"Sir, we're having a surgeon come as quickly as we can."
"Can you hear me, son?"
"Yes, sir."
I can hear you.
Will you tell General Hancock that General Armistead sends his regrets?
Will you tell him how very sorry I am?
"I will tell him, sir."
I will tell him.

"Let go of the horse, Major."
"Major Sorrel, I said let go of the horse."

Who is this?
"Oh, Detective Burris."
"No, it's all right."
I needed to get out.
What would you want with the dog?
"All right, then, but she's not here."
Hester took her to the vet.
You'll have to pick her up over there.
"No, just bring her here after."
And Mr. Burris?
Take good care of her.

"Detective Burris, this dog's a pussy, let me tell you that."
There's no way that I'd ever make her a violent.
"When a dog acts like that, she's never going"

"Well, thanks a lot."
You just shot my best theory right in the ass.
"Come on, Greta."
"Let's go, girl."
Come on.

"OK, Greta."

I never let anyone win.
I heard that you were in an accident...
How are you feeling...?
As you can see...
So you're okay...
I'm good.
I'm a little itchy.
This body has allergies.
So...
You have a lot of rocks in the house.
Oh...
It's a hobby of mine.
So people collect rocks too...
That's something.
Ouch!
You shouldn't be touching those...
These rocks represent my family
The large black one...is me.
The pretty white one is my wife.
The nice smooth one is Da Ran!
And this tiny little one...is Choong Sik!
"It's a rock family, a rock family!"
Dad rock...
Mom rock...
Child Rock!
"(The way it's pronounced, it sounds like Idol)"
Yeah...
"Well, since you're a part of our family too now...."
Let's find your own rock that we can put next to Da Ran together.
No thanks!
Why would I want that?
Shall we look for one?
A son-in-law rock?
"I don't mean that, but there's a..."
"Well, there is a certain way to do it."
"Oh, you mean little girls come with a set of instructions?"
No.
"No, what I mean is there are different kinds of kisses."
There.
Is that clear?
No.
Unless you mean little girls and little boys should kiss like this.
"Yes, yes, that's it."
Is that what I was doing?
"No, I'm..."
I'm afraid it wasn't.
You mean I was doing something like this.
Yes.
(STUTTERING) Yes.
That looked like what you were doing.
And I should have been doing this.
"Yes, that's it."
Now I'm all confused.
I forgot what I'm not supposed to do.
Wilbur.
"Oh, yeah."
I remember now.
(STUTTERING) That's enough!
"Hello, Bob."
Hello.
"Look, you stick to the little ones."

"Yeah, that too, but also, one more thing."
Is she mad at me?
Maybe.
A little.
"But look, a trip to Vegas will unbunch the pants."
It should be fun.
Please don't have fun.
"- Yeah, or crap out."
- That's so funny.
Later.
- So what am I doing?
- What do you mean what are you doing?
"Well, Leena told me Mrs. ""F"" was keeping you off the MacPherson trail, so it doesn't mean I can't look for him."
I'll say this once.
Listen.
Cut the nonsense.
Who was the man in the hat?
- I don't know who you mean.
- Where's Quini?
- I don't know.
- You're sick and he hasn't come to visit?
- I didn't tell him.
Why don't you call him?
- Mom!
"- Marina, look at me."
- Does your mom know what you do at the lodge?
- Mom!
- Tell us who the man is or we'll tell her.
- Mom!
- What is it?
- I don't feel well.
- My stomach hurts.
I'm going to throw up.
"- Honey, what's wrong?"
"Don't worry, ma'am."
We were just leaving.
- Thanks for the coffee.
- You're welcome.
Marina?
- What are you doing?
- Did you believe a word she said?
Me neither.
She's scared and I'm going to find out why.
"There are five bedrooms, each with several beds."
I have extra beds if there are more of you.
There's room outside for the dogs.
"There's water, electricity..."
"Bitey-bitey, eyes shut tighty!"
Oh.
"Hi, Dad."
"Don't you 'hi, Dad' me, you little prick."
What did I say?
What's the one thing I told you to do?
Floss?
Keep your nut down!
I did!
"So why, for Sphinx's sakes, is there not one, but two protests going on outside that door?"
"The Professor did that, not me."
"Well, hang on..."
And why are you chucking apples at some geezer strapped to a column?
Aurelius.
"Great to meet you, sir."
Love the beard.
It's jugball.
It's...
"He invented it, it was all him."
"Finally, he admits it!"
I couldn't give a pharaoh's fat one.
I've only come here cos I've been contacted by the bloody Emporium.
"You've spent 15,420 dinaris, and mostly on caviar."
"That wasn't me, I promise."
Right.
"Tutankhamen, give me the bleeding card back."
I don't know where it is.
I haven't seen it since I gave it to...
"Oh, brilliant."
"Have you got my card, boy?"
"Mm, yeah."
"Give it back, then, fuck face."
- Yeah?
- What do you call this then?
- Interesting!
- Wow.
Who's that from?
- Hannah Fields in the year below.
Sniff it to see if she rubbed her fanny on it.
Neil!
"Na, just a bit of perfume."
So what are you going to do about it?
Nothing.
Apart from making sure Carli doesn't find out.
I think she'll be too busy sucking on her boyfriend's knob.
- Shut up.
- What?
"All I'm saying is, he'll have his cock right deep in her gob and then in her vag."
"Out the vag, back in the gob."
Thanks!
"Oh, yeah, that reminds me."
Give that to your mum for us.
Are you serious?
"- Oh, you are."
- Don't tell her who it's from.
"No, course not."
"Anything else, Neil?"
- Would you like me to ask her out?
- Would you?
Let me think.
Would I?
No.
"No, I fucking wouldn't."
Good morning.
Watch out!
Look out!
Mater?
Mater!
Mater!
"Hey, take it easy, Mater!"
Oof!
Yee-hee!
He's nuts.
No need to watch where I'm goin'.
Just need to know where I've been.
"Whoa, that was incredible!"
How'd you do that?
Rearview mirrors.
"We'll get you some, and I'll teach you if you want."
"Yeah, maybe I'll use it in my big race."
"What's so important about this race of yours, anyway?"
It's not just a race.
We're talking about the Piston Cup!
I've been dreaming about it my whole life!
I'll be the first rookie in history ever to win it.
"And when I do, we're talkin' big new sponsor, with private helicopters."
No more medicated bumper ointment.
No more rusty old cars.
What's wrong with rusty old cars?
"Well, I don't mean you, Mater."
I mean other old cars.
You know?
- Not like you.
I like you.
"- It's OK, buddy."
"Hey, you think maybe one day I can get a ride in one of them helicopters?"
Shouldn't you be a delivery man by now?
Harriet!
"Well, Harriet, I'll tell you."
"Not long ago, I had another life."
"I had a big business, I had a lot of money, and you know what?"
I was the most miserable man alive.
"So, one day, I told my wife that..."
- Wife?
"- I told my wife that I wanted to start all over again and if she wanted to, she could start all over with me."
So what happened?
"Oh, she left me, but that's all right, that was her choice."
"My choice was to become a delivery boy... well, man."
"I don't have the business, of course."
I don't have the money.
You know what?
My life is sweet again.
Hmm.
The wurst!
"Oh, no!"
My wurst!
"No, no!"
Oh...
"Oh, Lord."
"Oh, no."
No.
"Don't be sad, Katherine."
This is a blessing in disguise.
That's a pretty good disguise.
Don't you see?
The three of us have to go out for dinner.
- No.
- Yeah!
Self-mutilation is an expression of a child crying out for help.
Wait a minute!
"I've read all the books, too."
I haven't seen a child crying out for help!
This is such crap!
He's a wonderful kid.
He's perfect!
- Too perfect.
- There is no such thing.
There is in children with psychotic tendencies.
"So now we have Ted Bundy, Jr."
Is that it?
"Look, Rachel."
I know you're hating this.
I'm hating this.
But your son has a problem.
"Why are you doing this, Shawn?"
- I'm trying to help.
- You don't want me to be happy.
That's ridiculous!
Stop denying the situation.
Enough.
That's all.
"Let's go, Rachel."
- Rachel--
- No!
Don't say it.
We have to do something.
They're too close to it.
Did you see any marks on his arm?
No!
I can't believe Shawn is doing this.
Why do I get the feeling you're getting the bigger half?
Let me ask you something.
If I'd have offered you less would you have been polite and taken it?
Of course.
You got what you wanted.
I like to kiss the pretty ones.
There's another pretty one.
You got BankExchange.
- How did you know?
- I saw the kiss.
I saw the smile.
How'd you get it?
I didn't say no.
But he'll take a bath on those leases.
It'll just take him longer.
"- Something for him, something for me."
- More for you?
"No, no."
More for the city.
"Hey, cigar."
Sneaking in a drink for Sydney?
I was.
Now they're both for me.
Helps Frank Anselmo go down.
Off-ramp and a subway stop already budgeted for.
But I'm left holding the bag.
What are you complaining about?
The bag's full of cash.
Minus a year.
You can weather a year.
You can weather 100 years.
I've got partners.
About sebastian?
He awaits you in your throne room.
Brother?
Francis.
I'm going to tell you something.
And it will hurt.
I know you're here to elope with mary.
You don't need to.
"All that nonsense about the prophecy,"
It's gone now.
My mother's let it go
For reasons she can explain.
I'm going to tell mary.
"She'll talk to my mother, to nostradamus."
She'll be convinced.
She won't trust catherine.
I don't trust catherine.
"You don't want things to change, to revert."
You're going to play on mary's fear.
She came to me willingly.
And she will stay with me.
She turned to you because she had to.
It was only a marriage of convenience.
And what was yours?
It went beyond that.
You know it.
And now you know
"Ours did, too."
You're lying.
You entitled son of a bitch.
You.
You're nothing.
That's Leslie Davison.
You guys go around back.
Make sure everything's all right there.
Looking for Officer Crowe.
They can't hear you.
You're dead.
You wanted to be Leslie.
"Well, you weren't good enough."
Somebody shoot that fucking car alarm.
"Say goodbye to the light, Emma."
I'm taking back the eyes you stole.
"Goddamn it, no!"
Over here!
Hold your fire!
You all right?
You all right?
"Sir, it's Crowe!"
"Oh, Jesus Christ."
"Ms. Brody, come with me."
Come on.
"Johnson, take the back."
Watch your head.
"Look, I know all of this has been hard on you... and again, I just want to thank you for everything."
I think we got enough now.
Sure you don't need to go to the hospital?
"No, think I've had enough of hospitals... for a while anyway."
Let me get somebody to take you home.
"I'll drop her off, lieutenant."
Why don't you take this.
Thank you.
It's the gray one.
I think I've got a ride home.
"- So, he's not your boyfriend?"
"- Mom, I barely know this person."
I don't know if I want to know this person.
"Well, then you haven't..."
What did you hear?
What did she tell you?
Nothing.
She didn't tell me anything.
Did she say I was sleeping with Jordan Catalano?
No.
"No, of course not."
No one said that.
- lt's just. I just wondered--
- She did.
I can't believe this. I can't believe this. I hate everyone.
Obviously I told my mother.
But all I said was you were hot for him.
Why did you even tell her that?
"Now, my mother thinks we slept together."
Okay.
Do you want my mother to call your mother...
and tell her you didn't sleep together?
I could do that.
- H i honey.
- Hey fag.
Go to hell.
Maybe later.
I have something for you.
is that perfume I smell?
"You know you are boring, don't you?"
- Turd head.
You need something?
This is very soft...
like velvet.
Naturally.
It's pure silk.
"It cost us 4,000 Rupees."
"Sleeping in this is so much fun, as if..."
"As much fun as it is in your husband's arms, right?"
Don't take of fence.
I said that only because...
"I enjoyed the bliss of Cashmere silk, on a mat with my husband."
Hand me the pillow-cover.
Who's this handsome hiding in your pillow?
Is he your brother?
He seems to be young.
Must be your elder brother then?
Why do you always giggle?
Go away.
He was my husband.
Was?
Is he no more?
Gosh!
Don't say that!
Have you had a drivorsh?
"It's ""divorce"", aunty."
Not drivorsh.
He's pretty good looking.
Looks can be misleading.
Give me that.
May I say something?
A young couple can separate... but parents must never be done apart.
Never mind that.
Go and see what Bharti is doing.
- What?
"- They stole it, it's ours!"
"I'll show you.0100 years, for that pigeon!"
- Won't Elisa be pleased.
"- Yes, she will."
Mind you don't hurl it.
"Fly home quickly, to Elisa."
Tell her we're coming!
"I said I'd fulfil your every wish, right?"
"Yes, your Highness."
And I shall!
You saved my life.
But this will be my keepsake.
"Never take it off, I got it from the devil."
How did you know we wouldn't drown?
I can't swim.
"A miller and water, we're body and soul."
And I'm friends with a watersprite.
"I name you my highest commander,"
I'll give you a house in the city and every year on this day...
Isn't it enough?
Just tell me.
"No, your Highness"
I don't know what I'd do with that.
But if I can really have a wish...
Henry!
Elisa!
"Terry, come, quickly, daddy's back!"
Theresa...
Welcome home.
That's our pigeon!
Look...
"You know, we gotta ask god's will"
"In your life, and he'll change things."
I think he talked to me today.
I'm sure he did.
"Oh, regina."
"Oh, baby."
"- Oh, look at me."
- ma.
"Now you know, like saul,"
"You can pick yourself up,"
Dust yourself off and go on forward.
You know?
"And listen,"
I owe you an apology.
I don't ever want you to think
"That i'm not proud of you,"
Because i am.
You're a very ambitious woman
And a very strong woman.
You're my daughter and i love you dearly.
"i want my daughter back, ma."
I owe her so many apologies.
- Oh baby.
- I don't know what to say.
I think i have missed every opportunity.
I...
I'll never have a chance to be a good mother.
"- Oh yes, you will."
- And i lost the man that i love.
"Oh regina, it's not over."
"And i'm gonna apologize to you, mama."
"- For what, baby?"
- Henry's right.
"- You're out, too."
"- Hey, wait a minute, Henry."
We had a deal.
"I help you, we take it down together."
The deal's changed.
I don't want anyone else to die.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
Who's going to die?
Since when did you become altruistic?
What the hell's going on?
It was a mistake to involve you.
Wait a second.
"You know who it is, don't you?"
Anyone else dies Henry and I am holding you personally responsible.
I work better alone.
Stay out of my way.
She's too powerful.
Henry!
That's great!
I mean that's just great.
So now I've got two of them running around the city.
He's doing it to protect us.
She's been watching him.
She's probably been watching him all night.
She?
And he's figured out who it is and he's protecting her.
The woman behind the vampire...
Christina.
And who the hell is Christina?
Trouble.
You were right.
You knew it from the minute we saw him that day.
It wasn't kosher.
There was a second report.
That was only a feeling.
Now it's a fact.
5 people are dead.
Stern looks so judicial.
How could he be so corrupt?
The sweater unravels.
I'll give you one this time.
"""""The only thing new in this world is the history you don't know. """""
New Testament?
Harry Truman.
Judge Stern's a good man.
He's good?
5 people are dead!
-What's your point?
-You throw the book at the guy.
Embrace Detective Santos.
Max death settlement for her.
Medal of Honor for the deceased.
I'll make sure Leslie makes the morning editions with it.
So you got this all figured out?
"-That's my job, isn't it?"
-That's cold.
That's cold.
I mean you don't just... .
It's more complicated than that.
Forgive me.
I know the two of you are old friends.
Be careful how you judge people.
- Cat?
- Mm-mm.
- Bird?
- Mm-mm.
- Wolf?
- Mm.
"Guinea pig, sidewinder, what?"
Just a cat.
Just a cat?
You never talk about your patients that way.
"What, you have to put one down?"
No.
I wasn't going to tell you.
- Tell me what?
- You promise you won't get mad?
About a cat?
Why would I get mad about a cat?
"It was Adalind's cat, and I know that you don't like her, and she knows that too."
She didn't even want me to tell you.
Let me see that.
"Nick, what's the matter with you?"
Take it easy.
How long ago did this happen?
"Today, just before lunch."
"Baby, I get scratches all the time."
Not like this you don't.
- You don't understand.
"- Yeah, I don't understand."
You're getting all worked up about nothing.
You don't know her like I do.
Okay?
"You know, you said that once before."
"What an interesting palm you've got, Christine."
Can you read palms?
A bit.
"This line here, for instance, means lots of love but not every love is a happy love."
So?
Tell me.
I don't know enough about it.
I might frighten you.
Why?
is it scary...or dangerous?
I see more loves in your present life than just me.
There's someone else...
Tell me I don't mind.
Yes.
I see a young man.
He's beautiful.
Yes.
He lives in... I see letters.
"K, and O with dots on top..."
is that German?
"Yes, Köln, or Cologne is where he lives."
You're really good at it.
"If you want me to go on, I need something tangible of his."
Something tangible?
- A key or a lock of hair or...
- A letter.
- Could work.
You got one?
- l'll get it.
- Here.
"- No, I don't want to read it."
Or you'll think it's all a trick.
There should be a number on it.
Ask Mace to look it up.
"Pretty, isn't it?"
(Sighing)
"Stop worrying, Howard."
There's hundreds of them.
And don't forget who's paying for all this.
"That's right, yes."
I'm suggesting exclusive rights to it all.
"I'm sorry, can you speak up?"
"No, I'm not going to sell them individually."
One moment.
"- We do want the world, don't we?"
- Of course we do.
And don't forget America.
"Yes, the world."
And America as well.
"Yes, good."
What?
"Oh, yes, splendid."
That would be grand.
Goodbye.
"Well, that should take pressure off Carter."
- Did they say yes?
- And at a very good price.
"Oh, Pops, you are clever."
Howard will be so pleased.
Let's have a drink.
LACAU:
It is outrageous.
They are behaving as if they own this country.
How dare they give exclusive rights to The Times?
She's like a guy.
What more could you ask for?
- I'm telling her I'm with you.
- No.
"Michael, what are you doing?"
Don't tell her you're out with me.
"No, I'm gonna screw it up."
I can't lie.
You're both gonna hate me forever.
Leave me out of it.
- I have faith in you.
- No.
Come here.
Michael.
Come here.
"Michael, Michael."
"Hey, Michael, come here a second."
My boss said to tell you that there's this guy who really wants to buy this thing coming by tomorrow.
But he is full of shit.
"I mean, I've worked here for three years."
You're the first people I ever showed it to.
"Smoked a lot of weed in there, though."
It's good for that.
- Hello.
"- Izzy, your father, he isn't breathing."
You need to get home quickly.
Okay.
I called the ambulance and the fire volunteers.
I gotta go.
Chris is moving into Kenny's?
"I think so, so they can, like, figure some stuff out."
I don't get it.
"Yeah, I missed you in sixth period."
"Yeah, I kind of skipped."
You can get your jaw off the floor now.
He's got you skipping school?
"Lucas, talk to me when you get your tattoo removed."
Alright.
Lucas!
What are you doing?
I'm taking care of my little girl.
You are such a trouble maker.
"Daddy stop it, come on."
Don't.
Stop.
"Hey, sit down, Rake Boy."
Hey.
I'm never gonna live that one down.
Probably not.
"It's okay, he can be way worse."
What have you got there?
- You're reading Faulkner in school now?
"- No, I just love his stuff."
So what did you do last night?
I saw you with Peyton.
What are you talking about?
You two just looked pretty friendly.
"Well, that's because we're friends."
And what are we?
"Well, I thought that we were dating."
"Well, it looked more like you were dating Peyton."
How messed up is that?
Brooke!
What was that about?
- It's the'80s.
The'70s.
"By the way, I'm sorry"
I came down on you a little hard at Leena's.
It's whatever.
"It's just 'cause I owe you, for helping me and saving Joshua."
"I mean, the guy hurt you."
It pisses me off.
If finding MacPherson...
Yeah.
"Just help me lift this thing, would you, on three."
"Well, can Mrs. Frederic find him?"
I don't know.
On three.
"One, two, three."
"The guy used to work here though, right?"
"And, what, the place drove him nuts?"
Something lured him to the dark side?
"He is the dark side and things are lured to him, people especially, which is why you're never gonna mention his name ever again."
- Just to you.
"- To anyone, promise me."
Is that Myka?
Whatever it is...
It's not good.
Red five.
- You're pushing our luck.
- And it's pushing right back.
- Take a break.
- I'm okay.
We've got enough.
Nobody's legs are getting broken.
Everybody's paid off.
I thought you just said you were here to see Livi.
- I did.
"- Oh, well in that case, go right through."
"Gee, thanks."
"Yeah, exsqueeze me."
"Livi is the biggest star on the planet, she doesn't just talk to anyone."
But I have something really important to give her.
I'll only be a minute.
You'll need to speak to Megan.
"Uh, uh..."
"Livi, how's my superstar?"
You look fabulous.
"Megan, you can't see me."
I...
"I don't need to, darling, you always look fabulous."
"Well, I don't right now, how's the new song coming along?"
"Oh, it's fantastic, a guaranteed hit."
"Great, I'll be at the studio in 10 minutes."
Can't wait to hear it.
"Um, yeah, me too."
Ciao.
"Wow, this new song sounds special."
It better be.
"Otherwise, we're in for it."
What'?
"Hello, I'm Megan, the studio manager."
Hi.
I'm Mia.
"I brought this demo for Livi to listen to, and I hope that..."
A demo?
"Don't worry, I'll deal with this."
Err...
Make him flee?
Mr. Thakur wants to become the CP.
Tomorrow if people find out that... one of his inmates has escaped... then you can flush his chances of a promotion... down the drain.
Good.
What's on your mind?
Clear all the charges against Shiv... and set him free.
Once his connection's severed from you...
I'll cut his connection with life permanently.
Wow!
What an idea!
Great.
I'm the boss after all.
Free advice along with contract.
Fine.
I'll give Shiv clean chit and release him.
Good.
But don't mess up the contract.
He won't.
How can he?
When he kills Shiv I'll be with him.
Right Boss.
Double-checking!
Double-checking!
Double-checking!
Get out.
Go on.
Let's go.
Who are you?
Boss.
Dad our player's entered the field.
Yes.
Wow!
I set the thing up already for tomorrow.
"What do you mean, tomorrow?"
Connor offered.
It's a vacation home-
- Connor?
The reason why I have two strikes is because your brother is incompetent.
He's reckless.
"All right, he can't read."
Hey.
I looked over the plans and they look good.
Okay?
Easy.
All right.
"Okay, after this, it's our last one."
This time for real.
Our last one.
I should have listened to you.
"We should have stopped a long time ago, but I kept..."
Ollie!
What?
He won't work with you again.
We're doing this job without you.
Shit.
"All right, let's go over this again."
All right.
7:00 AM we leave from here.
8:30 we arrive at the house.
I back the van all the way up to the front.
"8:35, you pick the lock, and open the side door."
Okay.
"Blair keeps the van running', and you and me load up."
Good job.
And then what?
"The old bag, fit for Ziegfeld Follies."
Aglaé!
To keep her happy I should have been equipped with the obelisk of Luxor.
- Mary
- I'm speechless!
- What are you up to?
I didn't hear you come in.
This gentleman let me in.
- Will you join us in the lounge?
- I'm heading for the kitchen.
Idiot.
André's got guts.
He does love me.
I'm sure he prefers me to his mother.
I share him so I can act better in the play.
Do you understand?
You've no right to judge me!
You've got too much fog in your head for that!
At last!
It's okay.
He's clean.
"Hey, St. Fruitcake, do you have news from Mickey for Mary?"
- I don't know where he is.
- Same as Mary...
You've come to join the winning team?
I've been telling you that he would find me.
He's my puppy.
Like my sweet little brother!
He knows about tomorrows.
"I'll give you your tomorrows, but hands off my today!"
"Mary got back her ticket, but for a price."
These gentlemen came to see the house.
They were just leaving.
Good afternoon.
- Who is that?
Do you know him?
- The watchman?
Never seen him in my life.
"Take a stroll, Jesus."
Drive.
I'll tell you where to go.
Go inside.
Go on.
Have a seat.
"Eugenio, give them something to drink, it's hot."
"The heroin Rodrigo found was mine, but he didn't find it, he stole it."
But I didn't kill anyone.
That's Fermin over there.
Angelita is his wife.
You've already met.
She's not psychic.
Fermin was at the farmhouse the night the girls were killed.
He knows more than what was in the well.
But there's a price.
What do you want?
Withdraw the Civil Guard from the Point.
Okay or not?
- Okay.
"- Tell them, Fermin."
I saw the man who threw the bag in the well.
- What did he look like?
"- I didn't see his face, it was too dark."
"But he was normal, a normal person."
Look out.
We've got to find the emergency switches.
"You two go that way, and you two go that way."
"Tony, we must eliminate Tia."
You will cause that portable utility panel to run her down.
"Hey, Tia, come here."
Come on.
"That ain't it, right?"
- You found it!
- I knew it was it!
"But, it's spelt wrong."
You guys get dazzler and muscles.
OK.
Come on.
The rest of the money's just arrived.
All right.
I'd better call Gannon.
The cooling system's on.
Switch it off.
We lost it!
What's going on down there?
It's coming back.
"650, 600..."
Gotcha!
"Tony, you must stop her."
"Tony, why are you doing these things?"
Why are you using your powers against me?
What's happened?
Tony pretend to remember Tia.
Lure her to the center of the room and make that crane drop on her.
Tia!
I'm starting to remember.
"Forget about the drive-bys, how are you supposed to meet anybody ?"
"Um, well, I did actually meet somebody, I think."
"I met this guy, and he's really cool."
-They got white guys at your school?
"-Um... no, actually they don't."
Shut up !
Look at me.
I want my money.
[Girl Crying] ldon't have it.
[Malakai] Shut up !
"Quit your crying, man."
[Girl] ldon't get paid till next week.
You wasn 't saying that when you was smoking it.
-l don't have it !
"-Well, you better find it somewhere."
- This ain't no lay a way plan.
- Hey !
"Hey, stop it !"
Come here.
"Where do you think you're going, huh ?"
Aahh !
Bitch !
"You ain't seen nothing, so don't say nothing... to nobody."
[Derek] I stole a bike here once.
- Why'd you do that ?
- 'Cause I didn't have one.
"- Oh, okay."
Good reason.
"- Well, it's not a reason, you know, I used to do shit like that, you know-- wild shit."
- With Malakai ?
- Yeah.
I don't get you two.
- What's she want?
"- She wants to see me, Damon."
Alaric is supposed to arrange a meeting.
We don't know why or what she wants.
You don't have to see her if you don't want to.
- I don't really have a choice.
- She's threatening to go on a killing spree.
Oh.
I take it that's not okay with you guys?
ELENA:
I wanna do it.
I wanna meet her.
"If I don't, I know I'll regret it."
Thanks.
Can you hear me?
Thanks for coming.
I'm nervous.
But I'm happy that you're here.
I love you.
[MOUTHS] I love you.
"Hello, Elena."
You look just like her.
It's eerie.
- You've met Katherine?
ISOBEL:
She found me after I turned.
"Genetic curiosity, I suppose."
She would be fascinated by you.
Is that how you can walk in the day?
Katherine helped me obtain it.
- Who's my father?
- Not important.
"Hell, that's some vocabulary you got, kid."
Spite.
"Ill will, vengeance."
"Vengeance means revenge, Miller."
"I'm sure you know what revenge means, don't you?"
I'm onto you Miller.
"Despite your stupid jokes, you secretly blame me for the accident."
"New car, or not, you despise me for it."
How did you get into my place?
Duplicate keys?
Credit card?
What?
"Fuck you, Miller!"
This shit's gonna stop!
"Get off my property, punk!"
Bastards.
Shit.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
7-4... 3-C-R-N.
743CRN.
What?
Shit.
Fuck!
"I'm sorry sir, but we don't provide... motorist information to the general public."
I'm not just a member of the general public.
This guy is a friend of mine.
But you don't know your friend's address?
"We just met, I don't know him that well."
"Sir, this is the DMV, not the dating service."
I just want talk to him.
"So, how about you check with the local dermatologist."
See if there's any medical records on Heung-guk or that woman.
"Stop it, you tramp!"
I can't believe this.
"It's important, you idiot!"
The rash is the link here.
"Come on, hurry."
Stop it!
You could hurt somebody!
Community Health Center
"Oh, my."
You're really getting on my nerves!
Where do you live?
Are you from this village?
Hey.
Don't come near me!
Dammit!
The lady killed them all.
What?
In there.
In that room.
What are you talking about?
"The old woman got a shaman to do some ritual, but the lady refused."
That's why they all got killed.
Are you a family member?
"No, I'm not."
Then who are you?
Come with me.
Hey!
What the...?
You can't go in there.
It's all right.
"The train goes down, goes around Lake Waste Water, and comes right back."
"It should back in 15 minutes, so we should just jump on it."
But when is Ethan gonna stop by the Juice Caboose with his next delivery?
Let me check my watch.
In exactly... 15 minutes!
This is gonna be close.
Mmm.
Speak to me.
You're hiding from me.
I'll find you.
Ooh...
"You have got a lot goin' on here, girl."
Ugh.
"Ah, there you are."
A California Central Coast Syrah.
"Okay, Bobby."
Now you taste your wine.
This one is probably...
wine.
I would say red.
Or it could be white.
I'm also realizing that I'm not as good at this as I thought I'd be.
"No, you're not."
"Chablis is a wine, right?"
You guys aren't answering me.
I'm gonna say that's a good sign.
I'm going with Chablis.
"Oh, I'm sorry, Bobby."
You're not good at this.
Poor Bob.
"I can't see your sad, pathetic face right now, but I bet it's crying."
I'll tell you what.
Letting him loose.
Somebody looking for me?
I can smell something burning out here.
Oh you!
Hi!
Having fun?
Keep going.
My turn now.
Call me.
"One apple juice, please."
How rude!
I'm not used to people not turning around to look at me.
So you are one of those silent types.
You come to a party and then stand alone in a corner...
Waiting for a girl.
"What does someone turning to look at you, have to do with your beauty?"
So that means you are interested in me.
Right?
Right.
"Actually, I have come with someone else."
So...
Oh.
I hope he won't mind if I hold your hand?
Or put my hand around your waist?
What happened?
Oh...
You can't dance.
This is a problem tall girls face.
- Excuse me!
- Yeah?
Let's see.
It didn't seem like you are here with someone else.
You can do anything you put your mind to.
What would you have done if I wasn't here?
"- You don't like to talk much, do you?"
"- You don't have that problem, do you?"
No.
"No, I talk all the time."
I'm a flibbertigibbet.
"That's what my English teacher, Mrs Wilson, calls me."
"""Tillie Hansen, you are a flibbertigibbet."""
Sounds like a noise a chicken would make.
Mrs Wilson kinda looks like a chicken.
- How come you ain't screaming?
- I am.
You just can't hear me.
"- All right, that's enough."
- One more stitch.
- Don't argue with me.
- One more stitch.
Just tie that off.
Pull it through.
Tie it right there.
Jeez!
All right.
"Here, get..."
Just put that on.
- Here.
- All right.
That's it.
"Come on, easy!"
Do it tight.
"What was that you were saying before to yourself, ""You're one of a kind""?"
I sometimes hear my mother talking to me.
Please accept... to pay them all this morning.
Good!
And so it shall be.
"Get behind me, sons of Fakoli."
You deserve a tribute...
O worthy son of your father.
What about the house?
"The sand's been delivered, the other materials are on their way."
Noumouké has promised it by the end of the month.
"Hurry up,"
German and French experts are coming.
Don't worry.
Hurry up!
Where's Diarra?
He's been arrested.
For lack of papers.
And where is he now?
I don't know.
What's the problem?
One of my workers has been arrested.
And I don't know why.
What's his name?
1000 FM to set him free.
I need him free.
You'll get an ID card.
"Thank you, brother."
"Come on, Diarraké."
Nobody's taking my son away!
I am!
"Then, I'll pursue you forever!"
What's going on?
"This witch is after me every day, we're going home to solve the problem."
How many?
- One.
- Three were pronounced on the scene.
"- Luka, let me take this."
"- It's okay, I got it."
"Officer, make sure these cars don't block that entrance."
"- Breathe for us, Trina."
- Tracheal shift.
Hold up.
Her lung is down.
"- Sats, only 88."
"- Miss, can you describe who did this?"
- Decreased on the right.
- Needle her.
- Want me to do it?
"- No, 18 gauge."
How many were there?
"You' re gonna get your ID as soon as she's stable, I promise."
She's not moving air.
No pulse.
Try the other side.
"- No, pull the dressing off."
- What?
"The dressing on the chest wound, pull it off."
"- Okay, pulse is stronger."
- Good chest excursions.
"All right, let's get her inside."
Luka?
Just need a minute.
"Dr. Lewis, patron saint of lost causes."
- GSW to head and chest.
- Tension pneumo.
"Wait, don't!"
"Please, don't!"
"Are you gonna talk, Joe?"
"Ok, start giving the kid a workout."
Oww!
"Please, don't!"
Shut up!
Cut it out!
Ok!
Will you talk now?
Ok.
I'll tell you.
Anybody still live in my old Westchester home?
"No, it's closed up."
"Well, out by the swimming pool is a great big..."
"This is the last stop, Joe."
What?
Come on!
"We're saying good-bye, papa."
"The kid, too?"
"Sure, with our love and kisses."
"He must be hotter than a firecracker now,"
And we got enough hot stuff as it is.
"Yeah, you can get to know the kid better!"
Then maybe all 4 of you can live together!
"How are you ducking bullets, Joe?"
"Yeah, the feds will be shooting at you from all sides!"
Thanks for the bus fare!
They ain't getting away with a thing.
That dough ain't going to be theirs for long.
Was there much?
The box looked real full.
I know you told Serena you love me.
Serena heard wrong.
Last year you told Nate.
This year you told Serena.
You tell everyone but me.
Why can't you tell me?
Is gossip girl right about you being a coward?
That's not true and you know it.
Gossip girl can be right about you all she wants
But I won't let her be right about me.
I will not be weak anymore.
You can't run.
You have to stay here and hear it this time.
Chuck Bass...
I love you.
I love you so much...
It consumes me.
I love you...
And I know you love me too.
Tell me you love me
Then everything we've done--
All the gossip and the lies
And the hurt
Will have been for something.
Tell me it was for something.
Maybe it was.
But it's not anymore.
Oh my gosh.
Do you remember the casbah?
That concert?
Barely...
In the best way.
"-Yes, sir."
-You got the cigars?
"-Yes, sir."
"Now, you boys have done a darn good job."
"Uh, uh..."
what's your number again?
"-Uh, 43, sir."
-43.
-Your number?
"-27, sir."
27.
"You take care of me, I'm gonna take care of you."
You boys may be used to deadbeats but not in this corner.
"You're in good shape, I'm taking good ca..."
"On the double, walk, hup, hup!"
"Here we go, hup, hup!"
"All right, now, look."
BELLHOP:
"Big doings tonight, eh, sir?"
We're going to have a big-time reunion-- my old squad coming.
-Yes...
"-These poor souls never lived before, like I'm going to show 'em."
"-Look, uh..."
"-Yes, sir."
No reason why I can't shack 'em up here.
No use in them getting a room.
"What the management don't know won't hurt 'em, you know?"
"-Get that stuff out of the bag, will you, kid?"
"-Yes, sir."
I tell you what I have to have done.
A lot of things have to be done real quick.
"You're doing a good job, kid."
- Fuck you!
Fuck you!
- Hello.
- Hey.
Don't hang up.
"Look, I'm so sorry about before."
I think...
"God, I must've had too much to drink or something, but if I promise not to try to kiss you or anything, will you come over here and talk to me?"
I really need to talk to you.
Anna?
Anna?
- Hi.
- Hey.
I promise I won't touch you.
Hey.
I don't care about tomorrow or anything else.
I just care that you're here.
Fuck!
"Oh, fuck!"
Why'd you leave without saying goodbye?
I have to go to this work thing.
I didn't want to wake you up.
Have you seen my keys?
"You can't wait to get back to her, can you?"
Can you just please help me find my keys?
What did I do?
"You didn't do anything, Kim."
You're amazing.
You were amazing.
Last night was perfect.
Here.
Thank you.
"Operator, you have got to be kidding!"
I have been on this line for 20 minutes!
Jesus Christ.
Can you believe this?
He doesn't even call his daughter on her birthday for Christ's sake.
Maybe the circuit is busy.
"Oh, circuits, my ass!"
He doesn't give a shit!
"Why don't you let me-- no, I've got it, Sharon."
It's all right.
"Operator, don't tell me there's no answer."
It's the hotel excelsior in Rome.
"Would you try it again, please, and let it ring?"
Hello?
Yes.
"No, operator,"
I've given you the number 4 times.
"What do you do, take an illiteracy test to get that job?"
"Don't tell me to be calm, God damn it!"
[Ring]
[Ring]
Yeah?
You're kidding me.
Ok.
I thought I just went to bed.
Yeah.
"Hey, what are we doing, scene 61?"
Ok.
"Oh, just remind flo about that blue belt."
"Yeah, I'll see you."
What are you doing here?
My bed was shaking.
"Your Grace, we've got it!"
In a Cage!
"How did you catch it, Jean?"
You have to be smart
- No more love-turtling for you.
- No more letters.
"She'll forget in time, and your day will come."
A pretty little widow she'll be.
Let me finish it.
"No, I like it, it's like a teeny weeny hell."
You'd do better to make some doughnuts.
We haven't had them for ages - yesterday.
"It's so far, it takes time for the pigeon to find him."
It'll come flying in soon.
I've waited for so long.
It could have lost its way.
Maybe it can't find Henry.
"I told you umpteen times that with my kerchief on, he can't have anything bad happen to him!"
"Henry, d'you hear me?"
- Jacob!
- I brought you some food.
- Have you seen the pigeon?
-No.
Could all my loved ones have forgotten me?
Henry!
What's happening?
Good gracious!
"Jacob, what's going on?"
Jacob?
!
Let me out!
"Oh God, a bad omen."
not a clairvoyant.
Go inside and keep Charles quiet.
Go inside now!
asshole.
This is private property.
it is.
I believe it belongs to a multinational smelting company based in Shanghai.
Where are you keeping the old man?
Hmm?
Is he over there?
Or is he there?
That'd be smart.
I'd like to meet him.
I'm told the HSA classifies his brain as a weapon of mass destruction now.
what happened back east.
He's been dead for a year.
I need the girl.
What girl?
The one that goes along with that ball you're holding.
There's no girl here.
I know you went to the motel.
I was called there.
There was no girl.
It was just the woman.
Just the woman.
Such as she was.
you saw Gabriela.
But you didn't call me.
That hurts.
did you?
did you?
I asked you first.
"Where, sir?"
Behind that vision in white.
You ready?
I'm frightened to death.
You're in the circle now.
"You've got the prettiest feathers in the room, now spread them."
"Right this way, mr."
Fisk.
Look at our jim fisk.
"Oh, that is mr."
"Jim fisk, eh?"
There she is.
Where?
"Right over there, behind that railing."
With my maid!
And my dress!
Here she comes.
"Don't worry, i got ammunition."
"You make a fool of fleurique, eh?"
"You steal my clothing, eh?"
"Here, throw these."
"Well, if you don't want to throw them, eat some of them."
They'll cool you off wonderful.
Look at the food mr.
Fisk buy.
Mm-hmm.
I think i'll let her wear the dress for tonight.
That's very considerate of you.
"Well, now that we're all friends, let's get together."
"They made a mistake about your table, jim."
We waited for you over there.
You want to know how that lucky piece landed?
What!
?
I'm already married.
No.
You're not.
That was private.
It was a private conversation.
Yeah you said you bought a ring yourself at Woolworth's.
When times got hard he tried to send you back to Wales.
And he's disappointed in you?
He's a stupid bloody fool.
But he's not as much a fool as you.
He changed a name for Christ sake!
Where's your fucking self respect?
How dare you?
You have no one.
You don't know.
I know you deserve better.
You?
You're the better!
Catrin I...uh...
Look I think...you must.
And I think...you're a drunk squalid bully.
Quiet!
Hush.
You are speaking of flight lieutenant Lundbeck?
Cha?
You know he didn't have any film roles under orders.
"They told me I would be good for ""Eagle Squadron"" recruitment, Sir."
He's desperate to get back in the air.
Poor boy.
Tea sir?
Now.
"Come on, up the rigging."
Get up!
Come on now!
"Up the rig, there."
Have they died up there?
Keep it moving!
Much better.
You've accomplished wonders with them.
"- Thank you, sir."
- Don't press them too hard.
Twelve minutes 45 seconds to beat.
They'll do it this time.
- Is he badly hurt?
"- Leg broken, sir."
Get him to the surgeon.
- That'll be enough drill for today.
"- Carry on, down below."
- Dismiss the starboard watch!
- Mr. Scott-Padget will you have dinner with me?
- Starboard watch secure.
"- Thank you, sir."
- What about the man injured today?
- Not too good.
I may have to take the leg off.
I'm sorry.
Mr. Scott-Padget asked if he can return to duty.
- You don't like him.
- I've served with him before.
- When?
- In the Beedle.
"Bad ship, that was."
Are you really gonna show me the bingo prizes?
"Just for you, Goten."
This way.
Sorry.
Hey.
Huh?
What was that?
"Okay, let's open this up."
Right.
Whoa.
Are these all bingo prizes?
Tsk tsk tsk...
"Goten, don't go getting surprised yet."
Click.
What's this?
"Oh, Goten."
Of course it'll hurt if you just rush in and touch it.
"Whoa, that's some tough security...."
Mum's invention.
She says that nobody will find the grand prize when it's in this.
Then we won't be able to see it either...
Don't worry.
"Mum's inventions may be great, but..."
See?
They've always got some sort of flaw.
"Great job, Trunks-kun."
"Okay then, I'll show you the grand prize."
Whoa.
I'm hungry...
"It's your own fault, Pilaf-sama."
We've had nothing but grass to eat for three days.
"That's a harsh diet, even for a dog."
I'll force him to fight!
What do you mean?
"If you kill them, how can we tell which faction is superior?"
So you tricked us!
You filthy woman!
You induced me to avoid the archery.
You all go out!
"Sister, what are you doing?"
"Brother, you must not kill them now."
You go away!
"Brother, forget about it!"
Brother!
"Jun-kit, what strike is that?"
Please excuse me!
Come on!
Good strike!
You haven't learned this sword before.
He certainly hasn't!
"Fung-wu, I'll give it back."
You fight better than me!
Take the sword.
Just fight!
You haven't seen this Chin Kang Fist before.
"Brother, stop."
He's changing styles.
I'll see what else they've got!
How about my fist?
You want to learn?
"Brother, are you hurt?"
"It's alright, I haven't hurt him!"
Ridiculous.
Go!
Haven't we all?
"After he died, I"
- I found a change in myself.
My body changed.
Everything changed.
I know if any
- I don't know if anyone has ever told you that before.
And this is the first time I'm talking about it.
[Laughing]
He was one wonderful guy.
But I had a wonderful life.
And that's the thing.
I was one of the luckiest women.
And then he left me.
God took him away... and left me with three small kids.
[Laughing]
And now when I look back at it...
I can't understand how I did it.
I can't.
I went to work.
I had three kids.
I put them
- I took them to a nursing school in the morning.
I picked them up after 5:00.
We came home and we had dinner.
Sometimes I cheated.
I used to go and buy dinner and then pick them up.
[Laughing]
"Ah, dear."
But they liked me to go to the store with them.
Ah.
Where did the years go?
- Yeah.
Michelle.
She's awesome.
She's out in New York right now doing a play.
You two would totally hit it off.
She loves hot gay dudes.
Always trying to convert them.
"Hey, uh, you into the Lakers?"
What?
The basketball team?
My agent got me floor seats for tonight's game.
We could go if you want.
"- You know, grab a couple beers after."
"- Yeah, sure."
Cool.
Come on.
Let's go.
Lola!
"Lola, come on!"
She's a good girl.
What a waste.
You're going to one of the biggest games
- and I'm stuck at home.
- Stuck at home?
Every time I turn around you're racing to get out of here.
"Yeah, but I'm exhausted."
"You know, Julia woke me up at 5 AM."
Not in the mood for an erotic wake-up call?
Not at 5 AM.
The guy is messing with my head.
"In the gay column I have flirting, giving me shoes, Lola the pug."
"And in the straight column I have girlfriend, Lakers and use of the words ""dude"" and ""bro."""
- I'm open.
- Come on.
Move it around.
- Watch out.
Watch out.
- Hit my blocker.
Hit my blocker.
Can't feel it.
"Okay, put some mustard on this one."
"Yeah, right."
"Come on, man, keep it going."
"Let's do it, man."
Ten bucks for the first one who gets one past my glove.
L'll make it 50.
"Put that puck in the net, or we'll be here all night."
I am not pleased.
Cross!
Cross!
"Move, move!"
"Nice save, my darling."
Come in.
"Mr Mayor, thanks for driving over."
Never miss a practise.
Have you heard?
Newman failed a surprise inspection today.
This report should sway public opinion and clear the way for my purchase of the land.
What about the boys?
"Well, I love kids just as much as anyone, but..."
Excuse me.
"Do I need to install tampon dispensers in the locker room, ladies?"
Hit someone.
But there are...
"So, when did you get back from the States?"
2 years ago.
2 years?
"I know, I know."
I should've contacted you all.
"But you know how it is, it's just work and"
I married an American.
Stuart's a workaholic.
"And, well, I've got a little girl now, Nico, she's nearly 6."
"Ah, she's cute."
I have 3 myself.
Which is at least one too many.
"I kept meaning to, I kept putting it off."
And then one month turned into 6.
"I don't know, I don't know..."
You don't have to explain anything to us.
"We're big boys, aren't we?"
Here we are.
It's happened.
The 4 of us.
Grown up.
And Slade running a shelter.
How did that happen?
Says the doctor...
"Private doctor, actually, so..."
My socialism has gone out the window.
Blame the Americans.
"Well, assuage your conscience."
Come and visit.
See how we do things.
I might enlist your services.
I'd like that.
My horse!
Why did you let the general escape?
"Go, look for him!"
"Don't move, your Highness."
It's me.
Henry from Bavorov.
"Oh, dear God."
Thank you.
"If we survive, I'll fulfil your every wish."
"Come, your Highness, down to the water."
"Bring back the general, dead or alive!"
"Too late, soldier."
"No, just a few more steps!"
Get to the water!
We must cross that mountain.
- It's a precipice!
"- Jump, don't be afraid."
Now he's trapped!
We'll drown!
"Please jump, your Highness!"
Now!
The devil took them.
"Look, aren't they beautiful?"
!
The finest in the world!
You can't eat toadstools.
Show me what you picked.
"All these, look, all beautiful..."
The red ones are poisonous!
Pick only the boletus!
So they're all ugly and poisonous and that's a red one too.
"No, that's an orange-cap, a good one."
"Gigi, he is not interested."
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
"Alex, this is jacked."
The hostess is giving me shit for not wearing a black shirt.
- It's not black.
- Look at it.
Not a black shirt.
I see it.
It's not black.
This shit is black.
"If a guy gives you his phone number instead of taking yours, he's not interested."
He took mine first.
Then he gave...
"And also, if a guy wants to see you, believe me, he will see you."
I once called 55 Lauren Bells until I got the right one.
That's cute.
What happened?
"Oh, yeah, as it turns out, her ass looked really huge in the daylight."
[GIGI LAUGHS]
Is it your sensitivity that makes you so popular with women?
Don't call him.
He doesn't like you.
Don't tiptoe around my feelings.
"- Well, I'm just trying to help."
- I know.
Thank you.
Sure.
"I gotta get back to work, but good luck."
"Okay, bye."
"Hey, buddy, you home?"
CONOR:
Yeah.
- Ok.
- What?
Nothing.
"It's just, you're so bossy sometimes, it's kind of a turn-off."
Bossy?
Wow.
"Well, I only said that because..."
"No, that's cool, you know."
"I'll just, like, turn my brain off whenever we're together."
- That's not what I meant.
- So what?
"Did I, like, trick you into this or something?"
Did I pretend to be someone else that you... ?
No.
"I mean, I like how independent you are."
I just feel like sometimes it's kinda like you're dating yourself.
Like it doesn't even matter whether I'm here or not.
"Well, congrats."
It doesn't anymore.
Emma.
Emma!
Your secret admirer's outside.
"It's all about the Benjamins, baby."
Just what do you think $100 is gonna buy you?
'Cause you know what?
I don't want your guilt money.
"Yeah, I know who you are."
You're Robert Quinn.
"I Googled you, when you didn't show."
"Ok, look."
I'm sorry.
I took your DNA test.
She's suffering from amnesia.
- Amnesia.
- Yes.
She didn't recognise me.
She doesn't remember anything.
I've got to go to California to see her.
She'll recognise me.
"- Oh, she won't know you."
"- I'm her mother, she will."
"No, listen to me."
"It was one of the worst moments of my life, one of the most painful."
"When I stood in front of her after all this time, she had no idea who I was."
Oh.
"Oh, God, she's-"
"She's ill, she's in trouble."
"She needs me, Blake."
"No, damn it, no."
We've got to follow doctor's orders on this.
She is in very fragile condition.
"Now, she's not to be pushed, not under any circumstances, is that clear?"
Not any.
All right.
I won't go.
Good.
Good.
Thank you.
But we have another daughter who needs help.
"Now, Amanda's been going through a terrible time."
And I haven't been much good in helping her solve her problems.
"She needs your help, Alexis."
She needs you.
Mm.
"I always wanted to dance, sir."
"Good, then."
We can always use a go-go dancer.
"I am gay, sir."
"We can't hear you here, speak up!"
I am homosexual.
How can we be sure of that?
I brought you pictures.
"Here, take these."
What's this look?
What does yourdad have to say about this faggotry?
"Sir, my fatherwas a commanderlike you."
He died in combat in southeastern Turkey.
"Not sure, what he'd say now..."
Give me the envelope.
So?
"Sorry, wrong envelope."
We'll show you how it works.
Take him.
"Dad, I am fine..."
You forgot these in the car.
We'll take care of that.
I have to be honest.
I don't need these anymore.
Shove them up yourass.
How about shoving them up your girlfriend's ass.
Stick them up your mother's cunt.
"Pick on someone yourown size, asshole."
"Dad, I will go faraway."
Forgive me.
I am a faggot.
It's all my fault.
Cynthia!
Cynthia!
Hey!
Cynthia!
Thank God.
Thank God that is over!
"I mean, who jumps out of the canoe?"
You could have really hurt yourself out there!
Put these on.
Cynthia?
"Jason, I have had it!"
I can't do everything exactly the way you want!
I can't control the ocean and row the boat and stop the waves!
Calm down!
And I can't do anything about the fact that I can't get pregnant!
This is nuts.
"No, it's me."
And I just really need some time right now.
"Please stop following me, 'cause I need to be away from you."
Come on.
What are you doing?
"Hey, hey, where you going?"
That's a jungle!
You know what?
"I'm gonna go check on her, okay?"
"Great, thank you."
"Yeah, you guys go ahead."
I'm gonna make sure she's okay.
"Honey, I don't think it's a good idea that everyone separates right now."
I really don't think we have a choice.
Let me just go talk to her.
"No, Jason, she really needs a minute, okay?"
I see it.
And I make every effort to prepare them for what's coming.
"Well, I think I've heard enough for today."
What exactly are you trying to tell me?
Are you trying to tell me I'm going to die soon?
Is that it?
I told you everything.
You know everything.
Go fuck yourself.
Hurry up.
Sam.
"Sam, hurry up."
Bring that over.
Hurry up.
"Breathe, breathe, breathe."
We need a neck brace and a splint.
Get that here.
Look straight into the light.
Don't move.
The smell of the ghosts.
Follow the smell of the ghosts and you'll find the flower.
"What did you say, sweetheart?"
It's a cactus.
"It makes a flower once a year, at midnight."
Only once.
"At 12:00 noon, the flower dies, and it smells like ghosts."
The flower smells like ghosts?
"Yeah, but it's real nice."
Mommy says ghosts smell good.
The Night Blooming Cereus.
"Yes, I remember."
Mommy told me about it too.
Hee hee!
You've bust it.
How fast were you going?
"In the car, it was 124. 9."
"More, and the other side will go."
No.
Ready?
That's it.
'Didn't quite manage it that time. '
I'm not quitting.
I'll have another go.
You better succeed.
One of the strangest things about being over 40 is that you start to want contestants on game shows to win.
"You also start to like game show hosts, even dressed as deck chairs."
Richard Whiteley!
APPLAUSE
Wow.
How are you?
Have a seat.
I've got to be careful with this.
It's back to Bridlington tomorrow.
How much do you get for renting that out?
"Mind you, I'm not one to talk."
Let's be honest - really.
Let's do your career history.
Born up north.
Yorkshire.
Which is fine.
Educated at Cambridge.
Wooh!
Someone has to be.
You were the first person on Channel Four.

- Morning Ri.
- Hey Sara.
"So, how are things going with Dr. Lonsdale?"
Eh.
What?
What does that mean?
Meh.
Okay.
What are these sounds?
What's going on?
Nothing's going on.
He just did something before we had sex that turned me off.
- Maybe he was trying to be considerate.
- Yeah.
But then he did something after we had sex that really turned me off.
This is bad.
"This is very, very bad."
What am I gonna do?
Don't worry about it.
Everett and I have zero chemistry together.
"I guarantee you, he feels exactly the same way I do."
Sir...
I'm a blind man.
How would I know such details about the car?
Am I the one driving the car?
Who drives it?
My driver.
Until a couple of months ago.
After that?
He didn't maintain.
the car properly
"Also, I didn't use it much."
So I had to relieve him from his job.
No one used the car after that.
I take an auto or cab if necessary.
So...
No one has used the car for 2 months now?
Yes.
Anything else?
We will contact if anything else needed.
I have some work now.
So... 2 thugs came home...
Your sight?
"Greetings, Sir."
"- You are Moorthy, right?"
Sculptor Manoj's Driver?
I was working as his driver 2 months ago.
Didn't you continue after that?
"No, Sir."
Don't lie.
You have driven his car and got it into an accident on the 18th.
I'm working here for the past 2 months.
It has been while since I last saw Mr.Manoj.
I am prettier than you.
And I am smarter than you.
"And humbler, apparently."
"But guess what, Allie."
What?
I'll always be crazier than you too.

"I've been married for 10 years, 10 years, and consecutively, with the same woman."
Wow.
I know. it's...
"You know, it's..."
Let me tell you.
"And so now, now sex is like bowling."
It's just like bowling.
"Because afterwards, you're like, ""That was fun."
That was great.
"- We should do that more often."" Ha-ha-ha."
"My wife is amazing, and I love this woman to death."
"But like most women, she loves to talk about her feelings."
- Know what I'm talking about?
"- Oh, yes."
- Do you like to talk about your feelings?
- Absolutely.
Of course.
It's like asking a klepto if they want a handbag.
Hello.
It's the other lens.
It looks like you were right.
Nobody jumps after putting in one contact lens.
Want me to put it in this evidence bag?
Bag number 32.
Hey. 32. 32. 3-2.
32.
"Mr. Monk, are you mocking me?"
In public?
I don't make fun of your job.
That's because I have a real job.
I'm solving a homicide here.
"Well, I have a real job, too."
I'm changing people's lives.
I'm making them rich.
Yeah.
You are not making them rich.
You're not giving them financial advice.
You're just reading little numbers off little white ping-pong balls.
"And if it wasn't you, they'd just hire some other bim..."
Some other what?
Bim what?
Bimportant person.
"Mr. Monk, do you think I'm a bimbo?"
"Look, I know what I do isn't the most bimportant job on the earth, but what do I do for you?"
Hand you wipes all day long?
Pick up your laundry?
"You know, people admire me now."
And I admit it.
I am enjoying the attention.
I guess I needed it.
Oi!
They're going down the science block.
Come back!
Halls of residence.
Shall we?
Good afternoon.
How may I help you?
We're seeking shelter from the fascist oppressors.
And we're wet.
Can I interest you in some hashish?
I'm not really supposed to.
Drugs do odd things to me at the moment.
Aren't they supposed to?
This is Matt.
You want a hit from the bong?
He is an artist.
"Truly, an artist."
I'm Toby.
His roommate.
"And this is of the purest, highest possible grade."
I assure you.
Cool!
Bravo!
All splendid fun.
Polly!
My little chaffinch.
How the devil are you?
"I'm going to pretend that I don't smell that, Toby."
"Smell what, mon petit chou?"
"It's very, very naughty what you're doing, Toby."
Quite possibly.
Anyway.
"- Look, Cohen, I think we need to really talk."
- Hey!
There you are.
"Look, some guy just puked all over an amplifier, and... -"
- Why was that tattooed girl just telling you about vomit?
"- She's, uh..."
She's my boss.
I actually work here now.
- What?
- Yeah.
It was the only way I could get those tickets.
- But why?
"- Well, I needed the tickets to show you that I could be selfless, and I needed to be selfless to get you to stop"
"- Cohen, that was really sweet. - Pathetic and sweet?"
"- No, just sweet."
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
"Oh, God."
Oh.
"Come on, I'm sor..."
"Summer, just wait a second."
- You are unbelievable.
"- Not in a good way, right?"
- I thought you just wanted to be friends.
- I do.
"- Oh, well, then what was that, that kiss?"
- I don't know.
I didn't mean for it to happen.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- So this whole night wasn't just a plan to get me back?
"- No, absolutely not."
Yeah.
That would be best.
I want to...
"It's my job, Chief."
We're going to get these sons of bitches.
I'll be waiting on you.
(LAUGHING)
RADIO DJ: 73 degrees in downtown Albuquerque.
We expect fair skies tomorrow stretching all the way across the southwest.
"So for you night owls out there, sit back, relax, and enjoy."
DALE:
"Hey, what are you two doing here?"
When did you guys get back?
EARL:
"Oh, Wednesday night."
That's no honeymoon.
You should have stayed longer.
"Well, Earl had to get back to work, and I'm starting a new job next week."
What are you going to be doing?
Keeping books down at the rice mill.
I went down and talked to old man Hosey.
He hired me on the spot.
You guys take it easy.
Take it easy.
Dale...
"Well, that's good."
"Well, congratulations."
"Thank you, Dale."
We better be going.
DALE:
Okay-doke.
"Do you want some of this, baby?"
[Breathes deeply]
"Well, I try really fucking hard."
- [Laughs]
- So I'm glad you noticed.
[Sighs]
"So, does this mean you're over your little freak-out?"
Hmm.
"No, I didn't fucking have a freak-out."
[Gasps]
- Yeah.
- Mnh-mnh.
"- Yes, you did."
"- No, trust me."
"If I was fucking freaking out, the police would be notified, helicopters would be deployed."
We'd have hounds released.
"Well, can we at least be on the news?"
News?
"Baby, it would be the top fucking story."
[Laughs]
[Sighs]
I need a drink.
You want one?
You know I can't have a drink.
Don't tempt me with that.
"It's empty calories, you little sorceress vixen."
[Laughs] You're a woman!
"Yeah, a woman you just fucked."
[Sighs]
I'll be right back.
[Sighs]
[Cellphone buzzes]
[Sighs]
I love the smell of progress in the morning.
"Come by and see me tonight, I'll have more good news for you."
This splotch of grime will soon be a gleaming suburb with strip malls on every corner.
We'll call it Frazierville or Bernietown.
"Sounds lovely, ma'am."
"Come on, boys, let's go."
Let's go.
"Come on, get up there."
"Get on your homework, okay."
"All right, group A, you guys are on dinner, group B, you're on..."
- My man.
- Out of here.
Bumpy ride on the short bus?
"What's up, buddy?"
You're on bathrooms.
Get out of here.
- Let's go!
"- Hey, what's up, man?"
You're on garbage.
Group B you're on dishes.
- Last one in the house does my laundry.
"- All right, let's go!"
- Halt!
"Tweaker, get back here!"
- Man.
"All right, empty your pockets and keep your hands where I can see them."
Empty your pockets.
"Sneak in more candy, you do dishes all month."
Clear?
Get out of here.
"Hup, two, three, four!"
"Hup, two, three, four!"
"Why do not you ask me there, man?"
I'll see you soon.
OK?
"Hi, honey."
Let's go to my camp.
It is located in White Creek near barracks where they took your family.
Follow me.
Sit down.
"Jeez, I'm sick."
"Toni, come here quickly."
Here.
Use this.
OK?
Shoot him if exaggerated.
Bu!
"Man, this is illegal."
"Yes it is legal, it took me the cell, not in the shack."
We can not be more legalistic.
No new evidence.
Really?
Why do not you arrest me if you have new evidence?
I like it here.
Is relaxed.
It seems to me that you are trying this trick before.
"If you think that this type of to break me,"
You've already seen it does not work.
-Yes.
What if I told you that your drug Lu Bates connected with the murder of Hastings?
"If Lu did it, arrested to me."
Do not worry.
We'll take you to the station.
Do not worry.
- A drink?
"With her drinking, how am I going to control myself?"
I'll get you one right away!
Wonderful!
She'll sure get drunk!
is this my heart beat or yours?
Or are our hearts beating as one?
Someone's knocking at the door!
Never mind him!
Answer the door!
How can I leave you alone?
Go and answer the door first!
"OK, stay where you are and reserve a place for me."
Collecting garbage removal fee!
This is the fee for 3 months.
Don't you ever bother me again.
But you haven't paid for 6 months.
Can't you just take this first?
Nobody's going to disturb us now.
You take a shower first!
Good idea.
Get all clean first!
I'm taking my shower.
"Bridget, I'll be real quick."
I mean I'll be quick at taking my shower!
Sure!
"Gosh, how can I say such silly things?"
Bridget!
"Robin darling, I have to go."
See you soon.
"Love, B!"
Robin darling!
- talking about?
"- Your date, Audrey?"
She got a visit from your wife.
Grace cancelled her.
Grace did?
You had no idea?
Do you know how this impacts my business?
Audrey Richardson?
She's one of my most important clients.
"Well, if Grace thought it was a bad idea, then I'm fine with that."
I'll find Audrey someone else.
Rein in your wife.
"I don't put my wife in her ""place."""
This isn't the '50s.
Remember what's at stake here.
"Look around, Adriana."
We are shut down.
The SEC is up our ass.
I am well aware of what's at stake.
Wait.
This is it.
Here.
The location.
It's perfect.
Your office?
Not my office.
A 1950s office.
"A throwback to old traditions, gender roles, where a man could ""rein in his wife."""
With all the sexual role-play that implies.
I like it.
I like it a lot.
"That was inspired, Neil."
.
"Make sure you come, you hear me."
Yo.
Ha.
Ho.
Yo.
"Oh, I can't take it, oh..."
"Oh, why's Beerus-sama coming here?"
Ka... me... ha... me... ha....
That was a nice one.
You idiot.
Tell me before you go firing that everywhere.
That ain't good...
"Give us some thought sometimes, won't you?"
Sorry about that...
I just wanna train and get stronger...
Really now...
That's exactly why I don't want you and Beerus-sama to meet.
Huh?
Who's Beerus-sama?
"Oh, I'm such an idiot, an idiot, an idiot."
You really were hiding' somethin' from me.
So that's why you were actin' so weird.
Is that guy a human?
He's not human.
He's a god.
He's on about the same level as the Kaioshin-sama.
And he's headed this way.
"But if he's a god, that shouldn't be a problem, should it?"
"He's a fickle and incredibly fearsome god, you see."
A fearsome god?
"He governs over the destruction in the universe, and... destroys planets and lifeforms at the slightest peeve."
And you have a son...
But I'm your wife forever.
"So, when you die.."
The house is for me.
"If not, why would I last this long."
It's better to leave her rest.
-I'm not tired!
Why did you leave the house and came here?
Do you want me to take you home?
-What are you saying?
That would kill her!
Máximo can't be good to me!
Yes..
Take me to my house!
"When you recover, you'll can come back."
"Now, you have to be strong."
-I don't want to be strong.
And you better realize this:
I don't have anything to thank you or your parents for.
It's better to leave her rest.
I was leaving...
-She can't be moved from here!
I suppose...
-She's perfectly fine!
- Máximo!
Come closer to the window.
Have a look.
They say breads are falling again.
Watch out!
Working conflicts.
Pensioner's home.
"Yes, put it through."
"Now he can not, he wants not, he knows not."
Thanks.
I'll do it.
Here comes the soup for my first broken Venom.
"Mickey's a mover and a shaker, but this mean Matalan, he's angling for..."
"If this is still a man, he wouldn't take it, lying down!"
It's manhood at question now.
Man's ugly business.
"Honor, power..."
Gonna start moaning?
Was my mom moaning?
Me?
I faked the screams!
"A spoonful, my love?"
"Love is a miracle, you want to see a miracle?"
I'm just following your laws.
You really are the puppet they made out of you.
Fucked by a grenade.
"You can't fuck over, or even just fuck!"
Anyone!
Anyone!
Go away!
Can't you understand?
I'll come!
"I'll come, I swear!"
Shall I decorate with his brains too?
I'm not ashamed.
I'm not ashamed.
It's not my fault.
It's mine.
Idiot.
So you're in?
"Today, on the Golden State Freeway two boxes of deadly baby food were lost."
This baby food is contaminated with botulism.
"The boxes are marked ""Dalecki's. """
Why do I do that?
I mean just...
I'm too nice a guy.
I don't believe this.
Hey.
Hey.
"Yeah, you."
What do you think you're doing?
You were doing 68.
"You know, I could give you a citation for that."
That's 13 miles over the speed limit.
Thirteen miles.
Do you know that?
"Yeah, all right."
Just keep it under 55.
And consider yourself warned and advised.
Boy.
Why am I such a nice guy?
Now you stay by the window and watch.
Every move is a picture.
"Now, go on by the window."
Is she still out there?
"What ""Uh-oh""?"
Is she with another guy?
What's he doing here?
I don't know.
Maybe he heard about Melinda.
"If he's here, it means we're in trouble."
But what did we do?
Better come with me.
Did everything go alright?
Not now.
"Hi, Kelly."
"My regular, Willy."
Right.
"Two more beers, Willy."
Yeah.
Can I buy you a drink?
I got one.
"Hi, buddy, what'll you have?"
"This is for hers, and I'll have a cognac."
Thanks.
You just get off the boat?
"Yes, how did you know?"
It shows all over.
Where are you from?
France.
Hm... where did you learn to speak English so good?
I studied at a great school in Oxford.
Oxford...
I oughta go there.
They'd be more likely to study you there.
Are you being insulting?
"No, I just meant that you'd make a fascinating course in anatomy."
Thanks.
How come you just get off the boat and head straight for a bar?
Looking for company.
"Hm, what sort of company?"
Your sort.
How do you know what my sort is?
"Well, you're not a school teacher."
"Yeah, I'm--I'm buying all the hot dogs."
"Oh, come on, lady."
And I'm giving them to the good people.
Who's that?
Kicking it down the street
Causin' a stir.
Who's that?
I know that you're wondrin'
That's her
"That's her, that's her, that's her, that's her."
Who's got the kind of charisma that
The boys prefer.
Who's hot and you know that she knows it.
That's her.
She's like a summer sky.
It's like some cherry pie.
And there is butterfly.
Me oh my.
Who flaunts her feminine magic.
That's her That's me!
That's Pam!
The overly-confident morbidly obese woman.
This fat suit smells like corn chips.
"Going again, please."
Thank you.
And this is the set of The Girlie Show.
It's a real fun ladies' comedy show for ladies.
"Hey, everybody."
"Look, here's someone you never get a chance to meet."
"It's the head writer of The Girlie Show, Liz Lemon!"
The Girlie Show.
"Hold on, I'll connect you."
Worse than you?
You don't say anything but I hear it.
Go away.
"You can't do it, I'll deal with him myself."
Here he comes.
You are...?
Don't you know me?
How can I not know you?
What's this?
You don't know me but you know her?
You stop.
"We are friends, right?"
- You come with me.
- Where to?
Dicky?
What's this dicky?
Not only at night he's different in day time also.
Actually we are not friends but lovers.
Are we lovers?
I don't believe it.
You must believe it.
How can I?
Was I such a violent guy?
- Remember it?
- Remember it?
How can he remember past with just one scene?
Continue it.
It happened like this then...
When?
"Did you think I forgot everything, right?"
I remember everything.
"What do you remember, sunny?"
"I saw the line of people waiting for the ""Haunted Montecito Tour."""
You want the suite back?
You give me twice what I paid.
Twice?
I'll tell you what I'll give you twice of...
- Ed.
- What?
Can I speak with you for a moment?
Excuse us.
What is it?
It's worth it.
Monica.
"You know even dead, that bitch is givin' me a headache."
"I don't know what you want, but don't you try any of that reverse psychology stuff on me again."
It won't work.
"You hear me, Sam?"
Will not work.
Relax.
I have a simple question for you.
"Oh, a simple question?"
"What's this, reverse reverse psychology?"
"[Laughs] Touché, Ms. Marquez."
Touché.
"Okay, l-I have no idea what you're talking about."
"Oh, playing the innocent."
Very clever.
You okay?
"This ghost stuff is getting to you, isn't it?"
Maybe a little.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
"Anyway, what's the question?"
He's right as ninepence.
- Have you seen the size of that TV?
"- Full HD, of course."
No!
I need to put some paper down first.
"You can sit where you like, young man."
- You like that?
- Thank you.
"Of course, it's not as good as fresh from the vein."
Hang on.
We were told there wouldn't be any killing.
We wouldn't have brought him here otherwise.
I don't appreciate your tone.
"Given the company you've been keeping, it's understandable that you think that we're all cold-blooded killers."
What's that supposed to mean?
We have a much more civilised arrangement.
"Now, this is like a proper vampire house."
- Ooh!
"- No, no, no, the bulb's gone."
We stock up on the old eco-friendlies.
Comes with...
Watch your head!
"Here we are, through here."
- Ah!
"Ow, ow, ow!"
- All right?
"Oh, I don't know, I don't know."
- Aaah!
- Ha-ha-ha!
There he is!
Heh-heh!
Whoo!
You copy?
Angie?
Run!
Oh shit.
"Other way, other way."
"Go, go go go."
Go.
Are you okay?
Are you with me?
"No, no no."
I'm okay.
Oh shit.
Shit.
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.
Bye.
I fucking told you she was evil.
"Blair, we um, we need to barricade the doors."
All right?
"We need to barricade the doors, we need to buy some time."
All right?
We gotta keep moving.
"Look, they're calculated killers, okay."
"Blair, look, if someone comes looking for the sheriff..."
They're gonna wanna make sure there aren't any signs that anything happened.
Okay?
"So, that means that, they're gonna have to hide his body, or hide his patrol car, and hide our van."
"Okay, so there's some time."
There's a little bit of time.
Okay?
"Look, that wasn't our last chance."
"There's uh, there's gotta be another way out."
"Ham and cheese, chicken, or egg and cress."
Egg and cress...
Isn't life wonderful?
You looking?
I don't... what?
"Few scars, few marks..."
What do you think of them?
I think they're horrible.
"At least I got 'em, mate."
Cos I fucking wear 'em.
Right...
How about you?
Do you... have any marks?
- No.
I'm fine.
"- Oh, yeah, course you are..."
You're fine and dandy.
Right?
Egg and cress...
It's a little fucking miracle.
18 years old.
The age of opportunity.
I bet you can't wait to come here!
"Imagine it... being able to live away from your parents and you can do anything you like, like stay up all night and eat ice cream!"
Derek.
"Thanks, Polly."
So.
"New home, new friends, new horizons."
"The good times, the bad times..."
The parties...
"oh, my God, the parties!"
"The loves that will never be, even though they seem so right."
How can you say that after what happened to you?
- That kid's dead.
- Dean.
I'm gonna rip his lungs out!
- It's not a big deal.
- Not a big deal?
"Sammy, look at yourself."
If dad was here...
He's not.
"Well, I am!"
And as soon I'm finished with that dick...
"Shut up, okay?"
!
I don't need your help.
"That's right, you don't."
You could have torn him apart.
So why didn't you?
"Because I don't want to be the freak for once, Dean."
I want to be normal.
So taking a beating -- that's normal?
Any word from dad?
"He called this morning, said he's going to be another week at least."
We weren't supposed to be here this long.
At least you've got Amanda.
She's cool.
"Dude, she wants me to meet her parents."
I don't do parents.
"Mr. Winchester, can I talk to you?"
Um...
I'll wait for you outside.
"Look, if this is about the fight, I didn't start it."
"Oh, no, it's not about the fight, Sam."
Where's your friend?
-Ariving.
Your cop friends?
Around are.
Are they here?
Just me now.
You and that fucking gun who do not know how to use it.
What happened Luu?
Dead.
What?
Fucking son of a bitch.
"This is a big problem for your friend, you know that?"
I do not think so.
Do not you know?
What the fuck do you want?
You and that stupid gun.
I saw how much you're handy with miracle.
-Sit down.
Have a seat.
Sit down or I'll kill you.
"Listen, man."
Why is a nice guy like you hanging out with a guy like Andes?
He kills people.
You kill people.
"Deserve it, your wife and child."
You mistake me understand.
It was an accident.
-Accident?
People have to come to me with a certain respect.
Some things can not tolerate.
"When someone accuses me of something,"
I take that as an insult.
Move!
Go!
Go!
- Najim!
"No, wait He's coming."
He's coming.
Stop the car.
- Quickly.
- Come on...
Come on...
Good boy.
Well done.
(GUARD GROANING)
That's not my usual fantasy.
Usually you're wearing latex and a strap on.
"I see the bullet hasn't improved your sense of humour, then."
And Stonebridge?
You found his corpse yet or are you still looking?
We don't know that he's dead yet.
He's been looking for that bullet ever since Kate died.
You knew that.
And you fucking used it.
You knew he'd go the whole nine yards to rescue some damsel in distress.
"Too bad your perfect plan fucked up, huh?"
"I liked him too, Scott, you know."
But unfortunately I can only rescue you at the moment.
Lucky me.
Bitch.
Nothing.
I think we're good.
They're just chasing blind.
For now.
- You're already on probation.
- How long have you been a cop?
- How many years?
One?
Two?
- Long enough to know the rules.
Partners back each other up.
You have no business telling me how partners should treat each other.
- You had a gun to his head.
- I wasn't going to shoot him.
- I'm trying to solve a murder!
- What murder?
"I hate to tell you this, but you're not a homicide detective any more."
"- 9221, this is base."
Come in.
- Hardy.
We've got another 111.
Northshore.
East of Glenwood Bridge.
Get the bow line.
This is Hardy.
We're on our way.
Let's go.
Now!
"If the kids have any bad dreams, call this number."
We'll send a counsellor out.
Get the kids home now.
"Kids, come on."
Let's go home.
- Why didn't you question them?
- What for?
- The body was dumped last night.
"Personally, I don't feel too comfortable working with you."
You made me nervous.
"You look like shit, acting all crazy."
What's up with you?
Nothing is up with me.
"It was an accident and I am the one who gotta live with it, not you."
"You ain't hearing me, man."
Nobody wants you here.
Nobody.
See you tomorrow.
Hey!
Hey!
"Howdy, partner."
You gotta go back to the shop.
Tucker needs to see you.
- What about?
"- I don't know, but it seemed important."
"Well, he's gonna have to wait."
It's Miller time.
We need to talk.
Follow me.
Come on!
Another Bourbon.
Make it double.
You shooting coke or something?
You look like a dope fiend to me.
No offence.
I don't use drugs.
I mean I don't even drink.
How about abnormally?
I see Reynolds is back to work.
Gets to make bail.
I say we go after it now!
No-one's going anywhere.
We'll handle this!
Stay calm.
How is he?
"I've given him something for the pain, but his injuries are too severe."
He's not gonna make it.
This can't be happening.
It's not possible.
I'm sorry.
Don't blame Ellia.
It was my idea.
You have to understand.
"When I found her, I'd just lost my own wife and son to a fever."
She was just lying there helpless.
"When I saw her, I knew what I had to do."
"As I told you, in the beginning she survived on food and water, like any young girl."
Then the hunger came.
It's alright.
Take what you need.
I can't!
Yes you can.
"She took what she needed from me to survive, until I perfected the serum."
Father?
Father?
I'm so sorry!
"She never fed on anyone, after that?"
No!
Alright!
"Teyla, Ronon, you're with me."
"The rest of you, stay here!"
Colonel!
Sleep tight.
Good night.
"Good night, Morten."
"Good night, Martin."
It will be fun to see what important thing I forgot.
"Yes, it will be lovely."
"As long as there's food and wine, everything will be fine."
- You're not nervous at all?
"- No, I'm looking at it as a test."
- Of what?
- Anna will marry many times.
The first wedding is always hard.
"With a little luck, it will be okay."
Jørgen...
Jørgen?
Yes?
"- Mother, aren't you in bed?"
- I can't get on line.
Don't speak to me like I'm senile.
Why can't I get online?
There's poker in three minutes.
Why did we have to get that damn wireless network?
But it's working now.
Thank you.
- Sleep tight.
- Don't stay up all night.
Sorry.
- Could we teach her to knock first?
"- I've tried, but she's senile."
Only when she wants to be.
- I'll send her to a home tomorrow.
- Do you promise?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I got your message the other day.
"I meant to call you back, but I forgot."
Don't you remember leaving me that message?
"Chief, this is John Klein."
I didn't call him.
"No, it's not me."
I analyzed both tapes with the voice print.
I don't care.
It may be my voice.
It's not me.
- It is not me.
- Listen to me.
I would swear in a court of law that that's your voice.
"Yeah, great."
Thanks.
Shit!
"Regular coffee to go, please."
Seventy-five cents.
Have a great day.
Do you know that woman?
- What woman?
- She just left.
You didn't see her?
- No.
- That's strange.
"She had long red hair, green eyes, real pretty, and she was asking about you."
- Did you see which way she went?
- No.
- What did she say?
- She asked a lot of strange questions.
What are you doing here?
That's not the information I have.
I swayed them once.
I could do it again.
[phone chimes]
I doubt it.
You're no longer that guy.
[whirs] [scooter horn beeps]
"- Hey, man."
You're out of line.
"- That's all right, I know the boss."
"""Proletariat""?"
"Oh, I get it, ""Coffee for the people."""
Eight bucks.
"Rich people, I guess."
"- Who do we have to thank for that, Chip?"
- Karl Marx?
"You, man."
They jacked up the rent on all the stores down here because of that hotel you made us think we wanted.
"Look, man, I lost my store too."
"Look, what do you want, Chip?"
- Just a coffee.
- No.
Your money's no good here.
"- Thanks, man."
I appreciate it.
"- No, man."
I don't want your business.
"All right, man."
I'll...
I'll think about it.
You want change?
"I just wanna say a big thank you to those of you who came out to the funeral last Wednesday of my dog, Pinot."
"You know babies go waa, waa, waa."
Look at me.
I think I'm so cool even though I'm just a big jerk.
Yeah.
And you know what that big jerk is.
Such a jerk
He went over and he slapped Justin in the face.
You know what Justin did?
Justin spit on him.
"And Danny, he was so mean, he was like ""Hey Justin."
"You give me your sweater"""
"You, you give me your sweater and... and I'm gonna do a high kick."
I'm gonna do another high kick.
"High kick, high kick, high kick"
And that was it.
Yeah.
Maybe I embellished a little bit but I feel like you guys got the gist.
Unbelievable.
Move Unbelievable.
Why is Danny being so mean?
Why can't you see what's going on?
Don't you remember the first time you met?
Of course I do.
It was right there in that office.
"Oh, I remember it like it was yesterday."
- ♪ That's all I really want ♪ - _
♪ some fun uh-uh-un ♪ ♪ don't you love me baby ♪
"♪ oh, girls ♪ ♪ they want to have fu-un ♪"
♪ Oh girls they wanna... ♪
- Justin?
- I didn't see you come in.
- Yes.
I want you to tell me that you know for a fact there's nothing wrong with my daughter except in her mind!
Tell me you know for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good!
You tell me that!
Did Regan know a priest was coming over?
No.
Did you know my mother died recently?
"Yes, I did."
I'm very sorry.
Is Regan aware of it?
Not at all.
Why do you ask?
It's not important.
Good night.
"You know, I'm like in seclusion."
"No, I'm just exhausted from work."
-What should I say anyway?
-Just talk to your daddy.
Tell him what you've been doing and how you're feeling.
I hope you can hear me.
Can you hear me okay?
He's not going to answer you.
"Talk to your daddy, honey."
I don't know what to say.
"Well, let's see."
First we....
No....
Wait.
I don't know.
-Tell him about Washington.
-Okay.
"You see, we're in Washington now, Daddy, and...."
"""He broke the bread, and gave it to his disciples and said:"
"Oh, my God."
"Ted, did you..."
- Big time.
- Nice!
High five!
Wait.
No!
No!
Retraction five!
"Hey, hey, you're the one who begged for a proxy bang."
"And while we're on the subject of family, I'm pretty sure you banged my mom."
Mom beats sister.
I never banged your mom.
You...
You just did the winking thing again!
"No, I didn't."
Fine.
"Hey, Barney."
Let me ask you something.
"Were you, uh, feeling a little sore this morning?"
Especially...
Friendship over!
"Oh, yeah."
"Who's your ""guitar-player-biker who couldn't find mild salsa... that said 'Screw it' and went medium"" bad boy?"
Oh.
"Marshall, your hand!"
"Okay, I'm pretty sure it wasn't that bad... but this is how Uncle Marshall likes to tell the story."
"Oh, yeah, no."
That's the cuff.
"I'm woozy, and I can't flex my fingers."
And the rotten-fish smell is getting stronger.
But I'm learning to compensate with my left.
"Are you sure you're okay, dude?"
"No, I'm not."
"I start thinking, you know, and it makes..."
It makes me so angry.
What am I saying?
Okay.
Were gonna go...
We're gonna go sign you up for the fight.
- Yes!
- And you stay here and eat your eggs.
Have the...
Have...
Make sure you eat some of the sandwich.
"- Yeah, you can just meet us down there, all right?"
- Can you meet us later?
Meet you later?
Can I meet you later?
- Are you gonna meet us?
"- Yes, I'm gonna meet you there later!"
All right.
"All right, sign here, here and here."
And what is this?
These are waiver forms in case your fighter is seriously injured... or killed.
"Oh, we don't care about that."
Sign away.
"- What's the, uh, fighter's name?"
- Clown Baby.
- Clown Ba...
Clown Baby?
- Yeah.
- You mean like a baby clown?
- Not a baby clown.
"- No, thank you."
I really don't eat meat.
I'll just go ahead with the penne.
- Spicy?
"- Yes, please."
Thanks.
"So, how are..."
Will and the boy?
"Let's forego the small talk today, Shelly."
- It'll make me feel cheap.
- Let the big talk begin.
Have you seen this?
That's my...
"That's my file on you, Senator."
- Mm-hmm.
- How did you get it?
Have you read it yet?
How did you get it?
Have you read it?
- What do you have to say for yourself?
"- With all due respect... um, Senator..."
- it doesn't matter what I have to say for myself.
"- Oh, it doesn't?"
"It seems to me, Mr. Chairman, all you can claim about me..."
"claim, is that I had sex..."
- Deviant sex.
- Who says it was deviant?
I do.
"And what I say, the people will believe."
And you know why?
Because I'll have a very big microphone in front of me.
"Wow, you must really hate me, Shelly."
Lydia might.
What if she doesn't know anything?
"Well, he doesn't have a restraining order against me, so..."
I'll talk to him myself.
"Okay, what do I do?"
"You have a make-up exam, remember?"
Promise me.
"If he does anything, you run the other way."
I can take care of myself.
"Allison, if you get hurt while I'm busy with some stupid test, someone's going to need to take care of me."
If he does anything...
Like?
Anything...
Weird or bizarre... anything.
Anything evil!
Jackson?
Did you still want to discuss your paper?
"You have one hour, Mr. McCall."
Begin.
"Really, Scott?"
I can't.
Oh...
I can't do this.
Can I do this?
"No, I am gonna go to work."
I am gonna go to work.
I am just gonna straighten up.
Just a tad.
"Oh, you just scared the hell out of me."
"Sorry, I wa..."
"I was just, um, I was... nothing."
"Ah, that's a... nice heels."
"Speak, will you?"
"Tell me, asshole!"
"Tell me, you fucking shithead!"
Fuck you!
"Stop staring, motherfucker!"
Don't call your daddy that!
Don't you look at me!
Stop it!
Daddy said he was sorry.
I'm gonna kill all of you.
How could you?
I met the shaman today.
He thinks there's a spirit in the house.
Something's possessed Hyo-jin.
"And if we don't act, there'll be dead bodies."
He's supposed to be the best.
Why didn't you answer my calls?
"Come with me, and don't give me any crap."
Ask him where he stashed the stuff from in there.
The things in there... where are they now?
What things?
He asks what things.
The stuff we saw before.
Things we saw... before.
The photographs?
You mean the pictures?
"Yeah, the pictures."
And the other stuff.
Yes.
I burned them.
Sorry?
I burned them.
What?
"Award-winning footage, Kyle."
Think you might be thinning a bit at the back though.
Steve?
Steve!
Idiot!
"Oh, yeah, about the film..."
I've decided to go another way.
"OK, yeah..."
Two points to the kindergarten.
"You've slowed me down, that's all."
"I've got the bait, and I'll be back for your wolves."
He is right about the bait.
"Yeah, I mean wolves can't resist it."
Although...
"Since I've got it, it's probably no use to him."
Very stealthy.
Thank you very much.
I think I'm ready for my close-up now.
This is for all the wolves out there.
Howl it with me now.
I remember the scent.
Then it went dark.
- Then I saw that man...
- He smelled bad.
- And then Shannon.
"- Yeah, but then Tom."
Which means we must have been trapped.
- Then released.
- By Tom.
We probably owe Shannon and Tom our lives and we can't even thank them.
What are you going to tell your parents?
I've always been loyal to you.
What is this?
So...you're staying?
"Yes, I'm staying."
What do you want me to do?
"Hey, Anthony."
How would you like it if I taught you how to catch the really big fish?
-Would you like that?
-Okay.
"You know, when I was your age,"
I went out fishing with all my brothers and my father.
Everybody.
I was the only one that caught a fish.
Nobody else could catch one.
Do you know how I did it?
"Every time I put the line in the water I said a Hail Mary and every time I said a Hail Mary, I caught a fish."
Do you believe that?
It's true.
That's the secret.
-Do you want to try it out on the lake?
-Okay.
What else have you got?
Everything will be okay.
-Did my brother go back?
"-Yeah, don't worry."
"He's ten times tougher than me, my brother."
He's old-fashioned.
"He didn't want dinner, just wanted to go home."
That's my brother!
Nothing could get him away from that two-mule town.
He could have been big here.
He could have had his own family.
Just say what you want.
You have to speak up.
How else can I understand you?
Why are you so distant suddenly?
I just want to freshen up my head a bit.
"Oh, that's it."
"Well, sir, you should do what you prefer."
"When things become clear to me, I'll call you."
It will become clear for sure.
I'll talk to you then.
"I'll express myself not with words, but with action and time."
What's the date today?
Ah!
You're here!
Have some coffee.
It's better than I'd expected.
Have some potatoes.
"Coffee, no thanks."
"Ah, yes."
I'll have some coke.
"- Okay, do you have change?"
"- Yeah, I've got some."
- Changwook!
- Be careful.
"- Shall we go, Director Kim?"
"- Uh, yeah."
"- It's a beautiful day, isn't it?"
- Lovely.
What's gotten into you?
Two days later
"Help me, please."
The phone has been turned off.
Then we go to a used car lot and get another car.
"Then we're gonna pass the motherfuckers, don't you understand that?"
Yeah.
"Shut up, Ray."
We're gonna pass the cops.
They're gonna see us.
"Ray, we got no fucking choice!"
"We head out of town, they gonna catch us."
Just shut the fuck up.
Morning.
BOTH:
Morning.
How are you boys?
DUD:
I got a hangover...
JOHN:
What do we got?
Nothing.
Quiet as a Sunday morning.
What time did you get here?
"Oh, hell, I came in and relieved Charlie around 4:00."
Y'all want some coffee?
No thanks.
No.
"Hey, Dud."
"Listen, I was thinking about what you was talking about last night."
"And, well, I can understand now why you're pissed off."
"I wasn't pissed off, exactly."
"No, no, no, it's okay, you're right, I mean, hell."
"If that old man hadn't been as deaf as a post,"
I could have blown the whole case.
"Well, I don't know."
They love me.
Ryan:
Castle?
"He's a giant pain in the ass, but he's good people."
Okay.
"Uh, yeah, sure."
We'll help.
"We'll interview Harris' sister, Veronica."
"Yeah, why don't you send us a copy of the murder book, okay?"
Thanks.
"I need a favor, but you can't tell Javi."
[Laughs] I don't know if I'm comfortable with that.
It's not bad.
It's just...
I met a guy.
I like him.
And I want you to run a background check on him.
- Romantic.
- Seriously.
"In this day and age, you can't trust anyone."
I don't want to fall for the guy and then discover he's got a thing for putting the lotion in the basket.
Okay.
"I'll, uh, check it out."
Check what out?
"Uh, this, uh..."
This rash that I have.
"Yeah, I wanted to get Lanie's medical opinion on it."
"Too much information, bro."
"Yeah, that's what I said."
"Later, boys."
Castle:
First thing we need to do is figure out what case Phillip Harris was working on.
What did I tell you?
"I talked to you before, didn't I?"
Didn't I say not to go buy anything for a while?
The fucking car?
It's a wedding gift from my mother.
It's under her name. I just got married.
-l love that car.
-Excuse me for a second.
-l just got married.
-Are you nuts?
-What am I getting excited for?
-Are you stupid?
We got a million fucking bulls out there.
Everyone's watching us.
It's under my mother's name.
It's a wedding gift.
I don't give a fuck.
Didn't you hear what I said?
Don't buy anything.
Don't get anything.
What's the matter with you?
What am I getting excited about?
"Because you're going to get us all fuckin' pinched, that's why."
"What are you, stupid?"
-What's the matter with you?
-l apologize.
-l'm sorry.
-What the fuck is the matter with you?
"I'm sorry, Jimmy."
It's under my mother's name.
What'd you say?
You being a fuckin' wise guy with me?
[heroic rock music plays]
- [echoing] i am your ghost of christmas present.
- hi!
[giggles]
- it's okay.
you can touch.
- [gasps] i can't believe you died at the end of your christmas video.
that must have really sucked.
- no worries.
even the ladies up there love the rock gods.
you know what i mean?
- yeah. [giggles]
- you'll see when you get up there... which is gonna be pretty soon.
- oh.
"yeah, yeah. i heard."
"well, yeah, i ain't living so good, but what are you gonna do?"
- i'll show you.
- okay.
- let's get this party started.
[christmas carol playing]
- we've already done this one.
- things aren't always what they appear.
- what a double-crosser!
pam and randy?
!
he's supposed to be back in town to see me.
- let's just see how this plays out.
- ugh.
- you want me to give you a tour?
- i want a tour of the inside.
- oh.
he don't need a damn tour.
But you want to know something?
- What?
- I think you're too young for me.
- That's the problem.
- I'm too young?
- You're too young for me.
- I'm not.
[Sobbing]
"[Ida] Claire, do you want to be alone?"
[Sobbing Continues]
"It's all right, Claire."
Just cry.
Perfectly all right.
"- Oh, God."
- I know.
I know.
"Claire, you know we all love you."
You know that.
And we want you to be well... and just think of all the wonderful times you had with Max.
Just think of those days.
You have known him a long time.
And now it was his time to leave.
[Ida] I'm getting fed up.
[Woman] What exactly is it that you're fed up with?
[Ida] I have to be with people.
I have to do something.
"See, I was a therapist."
And I had people on the table.
"And while I worked on them, they were telling me things."
And I learnt an awful lot from that job.
There are different peoples in the world.
That's for sure.
Philip.
I hope that wasn't too bad.
It's always bad.
There's just degrees of bad.
"Oh, hey."
How's it going?
Mmh... good.
We met before.
Er...
I don't think we have.
You sure about that?
Um...
I wanted to tell you I really liked your book.
"Those advance copies really get around, huh?"
"Anyway, the first one's better."
"Um, I haven't read it."
I'm not some weird groupie or anything.
"No, if you were a groupie, you likely would have read both my books."
Are there book groupies?
Author groupies?
"Not many, but yeah."
Hey!
(WHISTLES) Quick thought I just had.
I'm not doing any press for the book at all.
"Readings, interviews."
Nothing.
- You cannot be serious.
"- Oh, quite."
"That's a horrible, horrible idea."
I don't like the idea of being on display.
My mind is made up.
I wanna be left alone.
I need to...
I don't...
I've got...
I need to go...
Out of my way!
It's a panic attack.
That's all.
What?
It sounds like you're having a panic attack.
"I can't breathe, I can't..."
Maybe it's because you wanna fuck your sister.
What?
Do you want to fuck your sister?
No!
Jesus!
It's just people say panic attacks come from some deeply repressed sexual urges.
You know?
What?
"I was just testing a theory, see."
"Actually, I'm talking shit, cos it turns out a panic attack's just a fuckload of adrenaline mainlining into your heart."
It's just how we deal with danger.
"Fight or flight, they call it."
Right?
I don't know you.
"Are you a fighter or a flighter, Tony Stonem?"
Cos depending on your answer... well...
A lot depends on your answer.
I'll see you around.
"Hi, Effy."
How are you?
I'm fine.
How are you?
Did you send Gallow for Dr. Mead?
[Ursula]:
"Yes, I suggested he came straight to the house."
Good.
Good heavens!
What's going on here?
"Dorcas, we have a visitor."
Is the spare room ready?
"- I'll do it, Miss Janet."
"- This way, Mr. Pendered."
We have to go straight up the stairs.
[Bird chirping]
You can get out for a start.
I was talking to the magpie.
- You should've been more polite.
"- Oh, get on with it."
He's decent.
You can come in now.
He's obviously exhausted.
That ankle's gonna take some time.
"Doesn't have much to say for himself, does he?"
Perhaps he doesn't understand.
He doesn't look English.
"Yes, well, leave him to sleep."
I'll take a look in the morning.
I'll see myself out.
"- Thank you, Doctor."
Don't keep building up that fire.
"If he doesn't have a fever now, he soon will have."
We'd better leave him.
There's nothing we can do for the moment.
[Door opening]
Romeo.
"Oh, no."
"Thus, with a kiss, I die."
No.
No.
No.
"Oh, no."
"Oh, no."
So pale?
My best beloved husband lies here dead.
Not Romeo.
My child.
Not him of all.
"Oh, what unkind hour has brought to pass this miserable deed."
"Alas, my lady, we are overturned."
No.
A greater power than we can contradict has thwarted all our plans.
"Come away from death, contagion and unnatural sleep."
Leaving my husband to face this alone?
The watchman.
"My lady, come away."
Unkind!
To drink it all and leave no drop so I could follow after.
"Nay, good my lady."
Listen now and come.
I will hide you in a sisterhood of nuns.
"Stop, stop, not to question why."
- We must away.
- You go.
I must bid farewell to Romeo.
"Stay then, until you are at peace."
But linger not.
How long has he been down there?
Not long enough!
Adam...
The auction is about to start.
Christos hasn't turned up
What an idiot.
What's he playing?
You have to run the auction.
Me?
Yes.
Fuck!
Christos!
Are you serious?
Yes!
You're the oldest.
"It has to be a Clios, naturally."
That's the way things are done.
"This night, this gala might affect the situation of every one of us."
Great.
You haven't seen this before.
I don't tnink so.
This is all very impressive.
That's very kind of you.
A vision!
"Oh, forgive me..."
I had a few things I had to tie up.
"Please, not another word."
"So impressive of you, I thought, to hold such an event so soon after your terrible loss."
"I'm sorry, I hope that wasn't..."
"No, not at all!"
You look like you could use a top-up.
Absolutely.
Mickey...
Judas...
Mickey...
Judas...
"To survive, it's better to survive..."
See what's left?
"The old man's dead, Donald's dead, my woman..."
Your woman was a twat.
"Here, park this!"
You don't have to bad-mouth Martine!
It's a bit late for niceties!
I have a woman and a friend.
I'm home and dry.
"You said that, didn't you?"
"- No, it was you."
- Same thing.
Park her for me.
We've gotta pull out the stops.
"It's not The Beatles any more, it's Attilla and the Destroyers... no future."
"If there's still a future, it's tomorrow, 15 rue Nergal."
Now duck.
You trust this jerk with the hot stuff?
- The hot stuff and the ice queen!
- My virgin Mary!
Would you like some medication?
"Sure, I know a drugstore."
"Antoine and I knocked it off a few times, years ago."
"For peanuts, petty cash or speed!"
"Remember, Antoine?"
We'll keep the hearse.
Why not leave it here?
For what?
Rose.
- Just tell Claire I had to run.
"- Rose, I'm sorry."
I really thought I was over him.
I hate this.
It's so stupid.
- I must sound so pathetic.
"- No, not at all."
"He asked if Claire was happy, and I lied."
- Isn't that awful?
- Nothing criminal.
- Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.
- Are you feeling better now?
A little.
"- You know, Rose, it takes time."
"- Yeah, I know."
I want you to know that I really value our friendship.
It means a lot to me.
"I feel the same way, which is why tonight..."
"I better go home, I have to get dinner ready."
"I'll see you at 8:00, okay?"
Shall I bring anything for your mother?
"Yeah, a wooden stake and a crucifix."
Bye.
Rose loves to fold napkins.
It's one of her idiosyncrasies.
I came home late and threw this on.
God knows how I look.
- I hope you like it.
"- Oh, my God, Rose, it's art!"
It's not art.
An artist isn't only one who paints.
"Okay, look carefully!"
Hanging high as a star.
Flying light as butterfly
Kicking hard as the top star.
How's that?
What?
Isn't that right?
"You're okay, but, not good enough!"
Not good enough?
"You know these 3 stances have turned me into a strong man, look!"
"If so, why don't you work in the fields?"
You think I'm an ox?
Ox?
"Well, you aren't as big as that!"
"What then, you mean I'm puny?"
I can see that you're like a Mongol doctor
Sick or not sick as he wishes.
Lemme show you
Come!
Okay
Like Mongol doctor I'll give you a body check
I'm coming!
Left punch!
Right punch!
Wah!
Really fierce
"I mean, that's nothing"
Want to know how I defeated you?
Of course!
Then come again!
Hanging high as a star!
And the second one?
- No.
Yeah.
- It was a mustache.
It was a mustache.
"Mom, is there anything else?"
How about my acne or that piano tie I wore to the senior prom?
"Oh, my God."
You were the guy in the piano tie.
I can't believe this is happening.
"Mom, you're killing me."
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm going to make you a bagel.
"If it'll stop the humiliating trip down memory lane, please."
I thought we were being discreet.
You're not dressed.
I'm not naked.
What are you two whispering about down there?
I was just offering Tyler a ride to work today.
"Justin, come on now."
You don't need to feel uncomfortable.
Tyler is welcome to stay over anytime she likes.
You two are old enough to do what you want.
Just stay safe.
- We are.
- All right.
Here you go.
- Thank you.
- Eat up.
I'm going.
I'm going to get ready for my day.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Yachting.
"- Ah, good shite."
Would you look at that fucking eejit?
Can you not just say eejit?
That's what I did say.
Where are you going?
- Toilet.
"- Jesus, again?"
Me uterus is pressing into me bladder.
"Ah, now stop that, Sharon!"
I don't want to hear that sort of thing!
It's not right.
Sorry.
It's OK.
Where's the remote?
Da?
"No, you can't have a bike."
"It's not his birthday for ages yet, is it?"
"Oh, Jesus."
"There's nothing on the telly tonight, is there?"
There's never anything on.
"Oh, you're right, of course... but there's absolutely nothing on tonight, is there?"
I suppose a ride is out of the question?
Hang on till I get this line done.
You serious?
I suppose so.
Fucking great.
You're not messing now?
No.
Just let me finish the next line.
I'll go up and brush me teeth.
That'll be nice.
Let's get the doors and windows locked.
"We're staying here, where it's safe."
"He's out of control, and we're not having you going down with him."
I'm not going to let you abandon him!
Who are you?
I'm Bryn.
Your brother.
And I've come to take you home.
"Morning, Len."
It's funny it used to be the sound of the cycling that woke me and now... it's very much the smell.
"The sound you get used to it, not to the smell."
I like it.
"Len, when you work up a sweat it's like a slow-frying sausage."
Whitsun!
What?
Whitsun!
What are you talking about?
What are you doing for Whitsun?
Have you decided?
"Mum, I don't even know what or when Whitsun is."
Are you alright?
You look a bit peaky.
"Yeah, I feel a bit odd."
I might pop to the doctor.
"Oh, Jenny, love."
Have a thing about Whitsun!
Jenny?
What pants have you got on?
"Mum, go inside."
Would you want these *** ones?
You want a decent pair on for the doctor.
Get out!
Come here!
What are you smiling for?
You deaf person!
Gate?
!
Out?
!
Get out!
Who?
Then say so!
Why beat around the bush?
"Won't you go away, rascal?"
He was eating my head!
And why were you asking them?
- Are you nervous?
- Yes.
This girl has shot into my heart like a bullet.
"She sells flowers, yet fires bullets."
That's why it's said that one cannot trust the female species.
When I was hit with the bullet the first time...
- ...it hadn't been so painful.
"- But the pain is sweet, isn't it?"
- But what next?
- What do you mean?
Will this matter proceed further or not?
How will it proceed further?
You know I cannot do a thing.
I too don't know anything.
I haven't fallen in love often.
Brother!
"How are you, brother?"
Siri is a little ...
-are You fine?
What the fuck you think you are?
Thought he could be quiet and I never find out?
I could not say that Christer was helping us.
There was nothing between Christer and I since high school.
He worked for you!
It was with you that he talked that night!
I can cry if I want to!
Okay.
"Sit down, Siri."
-With Whom you spoke?
'They did not believe me.
"They think I knew, and now they want a lot of money."
-With Whom you spoke?
-I Did not say anything.
A journalist found out.
It was with you that he slept when we were discussing?
"Yes, a few nights on the couch."
I've never been with him.
"You met secretly at night, was not it?"
Why do not you stop him?
It was dangerous!
It was you who did join ...
What the fuck.
You're not my sister.
"He wanted, right?"
He wanted revenge for what happened in Sweden.
He was killed because he worked for you.
You killed him!
"And now they're killing me, too."
The same.
NiaII?
NiaII.
"You know, sometimes when it gets really smelly, NiaII doesn't admit it."
-Do you know what I mean?
-hold on.
Who's the first to admit their farts?
You should be proud of a smell like that.
-It was a creeper.
"-No, it wasn't."
"Man, I would admit that smell."
Let's call it.
"NiaII, NiaII you've been outed."
Zayn.
"I hate to do this, dude."
I just only need you for a bridge.
What time is it now?
You've been asleep for 1 0 minutes.
"-I'm sorry, dude."
"-No, I'II get up."
AII right.
I appreciate it.
Recording this third album has been extremely hard.
We've been waking up in the morning and going straight to the studio.
Then going to the arena  doing a show.
And then going straight back to the studio after a show.
So it's been really tough for us this time.
AII of my 1 0 minute slumber.
"We have to get "" Best Song Ever."""
"It felt like it was the next morning and you were already waking me up and I was like, ""Oh, my God."""
"One, two, three."
"Give me one time short on the ""ever."""
My bad.
I don't want to hear about it.
Just do it.
"It takes the brain of, like-- right."
I don't want to waste my 160 IQ on this particular problem.
You probably have a genius.
"Solve it, please."
Or I'll just go back there. [inaudible].
I'm not gonna have women and babies
"Walking through the-- you know, falling down on you guys."
I'll go back there.
I'll stay there.
You guys run it.
I'll handle it.
INTERVIEWER:
Do you think we should have some people
Just walk up the steps?
--[laughs] Just to piss Lloyd off?
INTERVIEWER:
Yes.
"Oh, yeah."
You missed the big explosion this morning.
"He-- no, I'm just kidding."
I'm making this all up.
"Like, I don't even want to start any rumors."
INTERVIEWER:
"Oh, no, no, no. [laughs]"
Oh.
[Laughs] You missed it.
[Chatter]
"Those are the brakes, right?"
But here we go-- the signs.
This is no entry.
Nice to see you again doctor Jones.
Thank you.
Hello Marion.
Indiana Jones.
Always knew someday you'd come walking back through my door.
I never doubted that.
Something made it inevitable.
So what are you doing here in Nepal?
I need one of the pieces your father collected.
I learned to hate you in the last ten years.
I never meant to hurt you.
I was a child.
I was in love.
It was wrong and you knew it!
You knew what you were doing.
Now I do.
This is my place.
Get out!
I did what I did.
You don't have to be happy about it.
But maybe we can help each other now.
"I need one of the pieces your father collected, a round piece about this size, with a hole in off center with a crystal."
You know the one I mean?
Yeah.
I know it.
Where is Abner...
Where is Abner?
Abner is dead.
Marion I'm sorry.
"What you did to me, to my life!"
I can only say I'm sorry so many times.
Well Say it again anyway!
Yeah we're good we're just here working on our calves.
Hey Drew.
- Hey hi...
Who was that?
Oh I know... that's a...
That's a client Jill!
Got back off!
Yeah right that's what it is!
Every single...
Jill called her engagement a match made in heaven.
Watching them squabble about wedding cakes and the medicinal benefits of anal sex
I couldn't help but think that Heaven has a strange sense of humor.
I'll call you later OK.
Ok.
- Ok.
Come on Bowie.
Bowie?
Terrible name.
Listen I want to try it...
Its just one little...
We can't even go hiking...
Just one time.
No!
You know that camera looks very good on you.
Aww you think?
So what are you going to do with these pictures?
I don't know.
Maybe sell them on the internet.
Make some money off your ass.
Album cover my man.
I'm telling you.
Want some?
I'm not sick of you at all.
And wow!
"It's been a good like six months, right?"
What?
Six months?
Then the Ice Land sign is like eight months?
You think we'd only last a year and a half?
I don't know.
I don't want to be presumptuous.
- I don't know if you're married orwhat.
- I'm not.
"Well, I'm separated."
We separated last month.
I was thinking... that Tyrone... was like 20 years away at least.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Okay.
"Well, actually I was thinking..."
"Tyrone is, like, when we die of old age."
"And this is, like, our whole life together, this block."
"See, that's perfect."
- Let's do it thatway.
- Okay.
"Well, guess it can't be avoided."
Everyone dies.
I could walk you to your car.
"Maybewe should just be glad... that we lived this long, good life together."
"You know, it's so much more than most people ever get to have."
- Okay.
- Okay.
"- Well, don't be afraid."
- Okay.
- Deal.
And stop bothering me about my hair.
We're interfering with your personal life?
I'm closing it ... relax.
God knows what he'll start thinking in his head now.
"Hey, what happened?"
"- There is nothing wrong, man."
Relax.
- Not that.
What about the booklets?
I've solved that problem.
He'll send them home.
69 Rafet.
It's super.
"Come on, I will take care of this."
It was obvious that something like this would happen.
"I'm telling you, I'll take care of it."
Don't do this.
"Oh, this is bad."
Can you please put yourjacket on?
"Ok, I'm putting my jacket on."
"Wait, I'll end this issue."
What's this guy's name?
Mert!
Yes?
"Hi, this is Zeynep Erez."
I'm Mert's new guidance counselor.
"If you have some time, can I have a word with you?"
Don't feel sad dear.
"If he wants to get divorced, then divorce him."
Don't say it like that dear.
It just hurts.
That's rough. I better go.
- ls Sharon here?
"- Yes, and so is dad."
"But he's upstairs lying down, he said not to disturb him."
"He said we should send out for some pizza, right?"
"But of course he didn't give me any money, he's trying to starve us."
Danielle!
"He's just upset, you know, about M r."
Cherski and everything.
- Go get your money box.
- No way!
"J ust lay it out, dad will pay you back later."
- You lay it out.
- l don't have any money!
is there anything to eat?
We're sending out for pizza.
"So, how's your dad doing?"
- How much money do you have?
- None. I'm seriously hungry.
"H i, is Sharon still here?"
"Oh, good. I mean, hi."
- l don't believe this.
- Believe it.
"- Hey, let Brian pay!"
- l don't mind.
- Pay for what?
"- Yes, why not?"
"I mean, maybe he doesn't mind paying for it."
We were going to send for pizza.
"I mean, good. I do have plenty of cash on me, it's no problem."
- What's no problem?
- We were going to send for pizza!
OLDER TED:
"There was no ""next time."""
Maggie's window never opened again.
Hey!
"Hey, I got it!"
"That country bar, Giddy-ups!"
The overalls have gotta work there.
Wingman me?
I don't want Giddy-ups.
I want that.
"I forgot what it feels like to chase the real thing, but I think I'm ready again."
Yeah.
Let me tell you where I'm at.
I wanna have sex with a girl so I can take off these overalls.
Come on.
Come on!
"Ted, you gotta help me!"
I gotta get these damn things off!
MRS. DOUGLAS:
Hey there.
I just love your overalls.
MARSHALL:
Dear 60-year-old Marshall.
By now you should be working somewhere that's making the world a better place.
Or at least trying to.
"No pressure, dude."
"I mean, sir."
"Also, if time travel is possible, maybe you could give me a little sign on Tuesday, December 8th, at 8:29 p.m."
"So, someone sent back these chicken wings, because they were too hot."
"And I'm like, ""Too hot?"
"Are you crazy?"""
"So, free wings."
She's still extremely beautiful.
Cheers!
Cheers.
"Why was I at that wedding, Jørgen?"
You knew.
I didn't know.
I didn't know you were that Jacob.
- I don't believe that.
- Well I can't change anything now.
What do you want?
- The honest or the official answer?
- I'd like the honest answer.
I'm just a good person.
There's not much in this.
We better complain.
- I don't need any more.
- We need another bottle.
It's the best way to get to know people.
Another bottle.
- I don't think that would be wise.
- You're not paid to think.
Either bring another bottle or bring your boss.
Understand?
Or should I ask him to translate?
- I need to go.
- Why?
We'd like another drink.
- What's the problem?
- We need a bottle of schnapps.
We can't serve you when you're so drunk.
So drunk?
I've only just gotten started.
Seeing these people...
Nagasaki...
That day...
I can feel it.
Okay.
"Even if it's okay for you, it's still too short for Clark."
His feet will stick out.
He's the same size as John Wayne.
How about using this to add length?
We did make fools of ourselves.
Don't you think so?
I guess you're right.
I really feel ashamed.
Where's Clark?
He stepped out into the garden with Grandma.
I wonder if it's all right.
I wonder if they can communicate.
I think it's all right.
They seem to be talking just fine.
I am terribly sorry for not knowing about Uncle.
I'm really sorry.
That's all right.
You were born and live in Nagasaki.
And still... we didn't realize it.
That was wrong of us.
We were wrong.
That's all right.
My father told me...
"""Clark, go..."
"""and do whatever you can for your aunt. """
That's what he said.
That's all right.
- Was this where you got carsick?
- I think it was.
- What do you mean?
- Pete got really bad...
"Well, on this night we were towing the Yugo, and I was facing the Yugo."
So I was driving backwards outside.
It was about 15 degrees.
And you had some bad food.
It smelled like gasoline.
And I think I ate some bad flan.
- Yeah.
- Bad what?
"You know, it's the old bad flan."
- Flan?
- Yeah.
You never had flan?
Flan like the pannacotta kind of flan?
It's like the Mexican dessert.
It's just like lard.
- It's just like caramel flavored lard.
"- No, it's not."
- It's like custard.
- It's cream.
"- Yeah, it's delicious."
- It's a damn flan.
- I'm not saying that it's not good.
"- Okay, so did you get all...?"
"I threw up on the process trailer, is what happened."
- You did.
- And I didn't finish the day.
"Christo Morse, our AD, saved me."
He directed the last quarter of the day.
"- Relax, man!"
"Gary, Gary, can we please just get out of here?"
Please?
What the hell?
Sorry I lost my temper back there.
"No, it's okay."
You were just defending my honor.
I don't feel so good.
Get you a glass of water.
"I know people say you're a jerk, but... they just don't know the real you."
I'm just gonna put this here.
You're gonna need that.
And a truckload of aspirin.
Get some sleep.
Hello?
So this barbecue on Saturday...
- Yes?
- I was just wondering if there was gonna be a smoked brisket involved.
Wait.
So you'll come based on the meat?
Yes.
"Yes, that's the deciding factor."
Done.
So what's up for tonight?
Not much.
Just a quiet evening at home.
You?
Not a lot... just getting my daily dose of jazz.
You hear it?
Love that one.
Crank it up.
You've got something right here on your...
"""It's not over yet fool."""
"""Beat the drums."""
"""Play the guitar."""
"""Now the flute."
"Don't you want to catch your breath?"""
"""Orchestra."
"Play."""
"""I've a simple philosophy."""
"""Live life filled with fun and frolic."""
"""I want the heart to be always happy."""
"""I am amazing."""
"""You can ask all the beauties."""
"""I made their hearts beat."""
"""My news is all over the papers... every day."""
"""I love on my own terms."""
"""If you don't believe me you can ask anyone."""
"""I move on merrily."""
"""Swaying left and right."""
"""The fun's full-on."""
"""Who can stop me?"""
"""I never spare."
"I beatup thrash..."""
"""...those who lock horns with me."""
"""I never spare."
"I beatup thrash..."""
"""...those who lock horns with me."""
"""The Boss has left stop jumping around."""
Don't tell father I'm here.
Go.
Why?
You got me exempted from all the charges and set me free.
Maybe father will be pleased upon hearing this... and might forget the...
Sounds like a great idea to me.
"Spencer, let's go."
I've done my part.
"As much as she hates to admit it,"
"The magazine really needs you, regina."
- oh.
"- Oh come on, spencer, please."
I am not gonna keep apologizing
- To someone who wants to keep an attitude with me.
- Okay.
- Let's go sit down.
- Thank you.
"Oh, i'm sorry."
There's nothing to sit on.
- Georgia: yes.
- Please consider it.
- Good night.
- Good night.
"Oh god, what a mess."
"Now what are you gonna do, gina?"
"I'm gonna think about it, mama."
That's what i'm gonna do.
She's not thinking about getting me back.
She's just trying to impress spencer.
She doesn't want me working with her.
"Oh, what do you care about whether she cares or not?"
She's offering your job back
And you haven't worked in six months.
We're in trouble here.
Where are you going?
I gotta go take a walk.
I gotta go clear my head.
A nice profit they'll make.
"America will fight, you'll see."
They'll fight.
Fight to the last Englishman.
Last Welshman too.
"They're all right when it comes to talking war, when do they start fighting it?"
What about right now?
You sound like a bloody Yank yourself.
"Stop it, stop it, all of you!"
"And what's going on in here, may I ask?"
You horrible little man!
You're all in close arrest.
Sergeant.
"Left, right, left, right, left, right, march."
Halt!
Next lad.
Quick march!
"Left, right, left, right..."
Next man take your place.
Anybody got a razor blade?
What do you want it for?
Think he's going to cut his throat?
"I like, Private Dawes."
You're lucky to get busted.
"Look at that bloke, Hitler."
He was a corporal ain't doing him much good.
You've got something there.
"Is that correct, McKendrick?"
"No, Sir."
I started it.
Anything to add?
"No, Sir."
I'll see you around.
"Now, just come on in."
Let's count it first.
Make sure it's all here.
"If you got the money, we're good."
It's all there.
"Just bring it in, man."
Okay?
"I wanna make sure I got my money, so come on in and count it."
"One hundred, two, three, four five, six, seven, eight, nine, we're up to a thousand?"
Yeah.
There's one.
"Twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, two thousand."
Getting closer.
"What's wrong, Tim?"
You look a little depressed.
"Okay, can we just get this over with, man?"
Just count the money and let us get out of here.
Hey!
"You wanna calm down, man?"
You would think I wasn't the one that got ripped off here.
"Yeah, why don't you call the cops then, Guy?"
"Ooh, good one, Billy."
Three...
Six...
Twenty-nine.
What do you know?
It's all there.
All right.
"It's taken care of and it's all paid up and he don't owe you a dime extra, all right?"
"Billy, let's go."
It's over with now.
He was part of the warning.
"Stop, stop, stop."
I didn't want to scare you.
He said...
He said the messages are real.
Something terrible is gonna happen.
"Connie, please."
We have to leave here now.
I will not live my life like that.
I will not make decisions based on messages from Indrid Cold.
He may be real to you.
He's not real to me.
"Okay, I'm going to Charleston."
I'll be at the Marriott.
Get yourself reassigned.
I don't want you anywhere near the plant today.
What if nothing happens?
What if there's no great tragedy?
What'll you do then?
- That's not the point.
"- Well, I think it is the point."
- Gordon believed what he heard too.
- I am not Gordon!
I know what's gonna happen.
You have to leave now.
I have to report to work.
We can talk about this later.
- Governor?
"- Good to see you, John."
I need to speak with you.
It's urgent.
"- What's this about, John?"
Okay.
"Al this hour, we'd have to add the daytime fee, too."
What do you mean?
If checking in before 11 PM we charge both the daytime and overnight fee.
What a rip off.
What're you doing?
It's my first bed in so long!
Feels nice and soft.
You stink.
I haven't bathed in over a week.
Huh?
Are you homeless or something?
"When I have money, I get a room."
When you don't?
Shall I pay first?
"It's okay, you already paid for food and hotel."
But that doesn't include sex.
Are you a saint?
Most guys usually expect sex.
"One time, a guy expected sex for buying me lunch."
Bunch of assholes.
"Right, bunch of assholes."
"Anyway, you should take a bath."
Okay.
"Wow, a jacuzzi!"
Hello?
How is it?
Nabbed a high schooler.
Underage fetches top money.
Make her fall for you.
"Leave it to me, I'll reel her in."
You better.
- I don't know Daze.
"Hey, girls."
There's stuff in the kitchen if you're hungry.
- Do you know why we're here?
"- Yes, I've been expecting you."
I think there's must be some sort of misunderstanding.
We're not here to clean your bathtub up.
Organize your closet or make you happy.
Really?
Yeah.
We're here to kill you.
Then there's no misunderstanding at all.
Do you mind if I have a word with my partner?
Wait a sec.
"Search him, Daze."
"He's clean, Vi."
Come on then.
"- This isn't go much like we pictured it, Vi."
"- Yeah, I know."
I just wish it more like a normal job.
Now it's weird.
I never really talked to a job before.
This might be some kind of test.
"Everything's a test, when you're a career woman."
Damn right.
And those dresses aren't gonna buy themselves.
- I got it!
- What?
- I know we could do!
- What?
Why don't we just go in there?
Blasting without thinking about it.
- do you understand?
- Right.
We're here to find out what Gene Hansen was doing the night he died.
I got it.
"If you suspect someone, don't accuse them."
Don't let on that you suspect.
Okay?
Do not pass go.
Do not collect $200.
You come directly to me.
- Do you understand?
"- Okay, okay, can we just go in now?"
All right.
"Wait, wait, wait."
Don't you think we should go in separately?
You don't think I fit in?
"Yeah, sure, narc."
"Okay, you take the customers."
Don't let on that we know each other.
What?
So what are you serving?
This is a private club.
"It's okay, Wynter."
This is Vicki Nelson.
She's doing some work for me.
She'll have some questions for you.
Please feel free to give her any assistance that she needs.
Taking a walk on the dark side are we?
"Unfortunately, I live there."
How long did you know Gene?
Since eighth grade.
Drama club.
Thank you for calling.
Lieutenant Barnhill received his posting.
He leaves in a few days.
"He was the airman who took your daughter to the movies, right?"
"Gosh, yes."
How did you know?
I figured.
The fight.
I thought there might be a connection.
"Perhaps retribution by the men of the parish, so I asked him."
Men?
Four to one.
He asked me to give you this to pass on to Emma if you felt it was...
Appropriate.
I have read it.
"I find I am camp censor, for my sins."
"It is a simple, rather sweet goodbye."
- I don't want to.
- Read it?
Read it or give it.
What if he is killed in action?
She is too young to know that a young man went to his death thinking of her.
"You may tell him I took it, but I reserve the right not to pass it on to her."
It would cast a shadow over her life.
I understand.
Mrs. Coyne.
You knew.
What?
What was being planned.
I didn't.
I swear.
Barney did.
Did you ever have a day when just everything went wrong?
Take your things and go in there and change.
Thank you.
"If you have any trouble with your buttons, just sing out."
(TRAIN HORN BLARING)
(THUNDER CRACKING)
Oh!
"Are you all right, Wilbur?"
"Yes, I'm fine."
There's nothing to be frightened of.
It's just the storm that woke you up.
You mustn't be afraid of thunder and lightning.
I'm not afraid.
"Oh, yes, you are."
All youngsters are.
"Why, I was terrified when I was your age."
I used to crawl in with my little brother.
"Remember, I'm only your nephew."
(THUNDER RUMBLING) This going to be a bad one.
"Just hang on to me tight, Willy."
I...
"I'm all right, really."
Just rest your head against my shoulder.
I can't do that.
Your husband wouldn't like that.
I have no husband.
"I'm not married, either."
I hope not.
And I'm glad you're not married.
Why?
Should I tell you?
Yes.
Amy is a really nice girl and so are you.
I told her all about you.
"If you told her all about me,"
I doubt she'd want to meet me.
"No, she does, she does, promise."
All right.
What time?
She's usually home by seven.
Are you sure about this?
I don't feel like I can hang out in the coffee shop unless Amy's comfortable with our being friends.
She's my wife.
All right.
"But if it gets boring, I'm leaving."
It's not going to be boring.
I have someone I want you to meet.
Oh?
Why didn't you say so?
See you at seven.
You want another cup of coffee?
I'll get the waitress.
"Oh, I don't know."
I kind of like those scones.
I got it!
"So, you're not dating anyone?"
Kind of.
But you know what they say about relationships.
"""Sooner or later, they're all over."""
Even your relationship with Ricky.
And yours.
"Hey, Clementine,"
"Adrian needs another cup of coffee, do you mind?"
"No, I don't mind."
"They let him off the hook, but it wasn't easy, let me tell you."
That's great news!
I guess.
You guess?
"Leo, come on."
Ben didn't burn down the school and he didn't get kicked out of school or get anyone else kicked out.
That's the best possible outcome.
It's over!
Congratulations!
"Oh, it's far from over."
He has to get through the rest of the school year without getting in trouble.
He won't get in anymore trouble.
He's not a bad kid.
Dylan's still circling around.
"Oh, another girl will come along and he'll forget all about her."
"(KNOCKING) No, I won't."
Ben!
I heard the good news.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Congratulations!
We should all go out and celebrate.
He can't go out.
He's on restriction.
"Oh, Leo."
Wait.
"I'm on restriction from seeing Dylan, but I can still go out."
"I'm going out with Alice, uh, we're going to go catch a movie or something."
"Oh, are you?"
"Yeah, she's coming over."
I will just be in the kitchen.
"That's okay, isn't it?"
Well the thing is I've been living a lie.
Just one?
"I'm living, like, 20."
What's yours?
"Well, I..."
I never actually had cancer.
I'll see you.
So he refused to tell you where he got the glasses?
Flat out refused.
"Yeah, isn't that just like him?"
"You know, he has to be the only one who has them."
"Yeah, tell me about it, soul sister."
"- Anyway, I told Jake that you said hi."
- What?
- You told Jake I said hi?
- Yeah.
I can't believe you did that.
Why did you tell him I said hi?
I never said hi.
When did I say hi?
- I never heard her say hi.
- It's common courtesy.
"No, no, Kramer."
You don't understand.
He made the last contact between us.
I had the upper hand in the post-breakup relationship.
"If he thinks that I said hi, then I lose the upper hand."
It's like a game of tag.
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere.
You're going to the bookstore to see Jake.
- So what if I do?
"Honey, our friend is asking for our help."
"She's 20 years old, for God's sake."
"She's probably with a bunch of dudes, like, sweating, drinking and dancing it out of her system."
What's the problem?
Let her spend the night on Hump Island!
"I promise, she's gonna come back here first thing in the morning!"
"Dave, firstly..."
I don't want her to spend a night on Hump Island.
"No, I..."
I'm just trying to say it's not like she's kidnapped or something.
"Now she's dead, Dave?"
Huh?
Now she's dead?
"She's dead, now?"
She's not dead.
She's dead on Hump Island!
I'm just trying to put it in perspective for you!
You know what?
"I don't even know why I'm blowing up at you, because it..."
It's...
"Once again, it's my fault."
This is a Shane thing.
I've been dealing with this all my life.
"First Jennifer, and now Trudy."
"We're gonna find her, okay?"
I got a plan.
I know how to get there.
You do?
"Yeah, I do."
"I just can't tell you now ""cause we got Mr. Belvedere clocking us."
Now everybody take it real casual.
Just drink your drinks and smile.
Don't you have anything to say?
Why you ask him?
"I'm asking you, he's not your dad."
I'm asking you.
Why look away?
Why do you bother?
He came between us when we'd problems.
Lisa...
"Lisa, aren't I good to you?"
"Exactly, aren't I good to you?"
"It has been 3 years, don't you like me?"
What're you saying?
You knew him before me?
Why didn't you tell me?
Then why go after her now?
That makes me the third party.
The air is great here.
"I can smell the grass and flowers,"
Nice smell...
Trying to sound poetic.
I like him this way.
What?
I can change if you like that.
How?
I've been observing him.
He expects nothing back for his money.
A direct and righteous man.
Bad-tempered but has a good heart.
The world needs people like him.
Don't change.
I've never heard anyone praise him.
Bad-tempered but a good heart.
"Yes, sir, Sir Charles."
I'd...
"Well, show her you're happy about it."
"Do something, man."
"Just another work of art, madam."
It's not in your catalog.
"We're feeling rather gay, are we, sir?"
"Poole, old friend, I'm going to be married very soon."
"Sir, you don't know how happy that makes me."
"I knew it would, Poole."
Thank you.
"Sir, there's a patient in the consulting room, a Miss Ivy Peterson."
She's without an appointment.
"If you've no time, I can..."
"No, no, that's all right."
I'll see her.
"So it's you, sir."
So you are the famous Dr. Jekyll.
Well...
I'm the one you and your friend took home that night.
- Remember?
"- Well, what what brings you here, Miss Peterson?"
- I think...
- Are you ill?
There.
That's what.
Look at that.
"Pretty, ain't it?"
Did you ever see a thing like that before?
I'll get you some lotion.
Lotion?
"It won't be lotion that will do the trick, sir."
I'm Eric Stoltz.
Alex is Watts.
Watts helps Eric Stoltz go on a date with Amanda Jones.
"Really, she's in love with Eric Stoltz."
So Amanda Jones is Conor?
I guess.
At first.
"Now men in general, but that's not the point."
The point is he's into me.
I knew there had to be some reason why he was spending that time with you.
I know.
It's so obvious now.
There are so many signs.
Signs.
Love signs.
You gotta tell me about the signs.
I love signs.
First they were small.
"At first when I called, he said, ""Good to hear from you."""
- Totally good sign.
- Right?
And then the next time I called he was with a woman but he took the call and we talked for a while.
- You know it was a woman?
"- Called her ""babe."""
"Okay, a guy doesn't leave a woman to go talk to another woman unless he's..."
And it gets more obvious.
"I mean, please."
There was no guy he was gonna fix me up with.
The fix-up was him.
No.
Yes.
He shows up without this fictitious Bill character.
I was flattered to hear we looked alike.
But do we?
So I thought about it.
And I think I know why he said that.
"Can't really explain in words, but somehow we are a bit alike."
"The way we talk, for example."
Really?
You're nicer than I thought.
Thanks.
So why did you ask to meet?
Don't you have a real reason?
No.
"You're just so pretty, and very close with Director Kim."
So I just wanted to know more about you.
What do you fear most in your life?
Obsession.
Obsession?
I'm afraid of betrayal.
Did your husband betray you?
Is that why you're getting a divorce?
"Director Kim told you that, too?"
Yeah.
"Yes, my husband betrayed me."
That's nothing to cry about.
Just divorce him.
And live right when you can forget him.
And what about you?
Why do you cling on to him?
I did?
Two nights ago.
Don't lie to me.
"Oh, I get it."
"They don't make gum or a patch for this, Ted."
"But, hey, billion-dollar idea alert."
That's okay.
I'll just buy a new dream journal.
What-What-What...
What are you looking for?
Your phone.
There's gotta be some pictures of her in here.
Damn it.
No!
Those are all worthless.
"I need some one-night stand material, Ted."
"Oh, oh, here's your mom."
"Hello, Virginia."
"Um, my mother's not one-night stand material."
"Yeah, you're right."
"It wasn't night, and we weren't standing."
Hey-oh.
- That didn't happen.
- You're right.
It didn't.
- You just winked.
"- No, I didn't."
- You just did it again!
"- Look, bottom line."
I need you to proxy-bang this girl for me.
Be my stand-in and put your gland in.
"Hey, wow."
That'd be good on a hat.
"Barney, she's just using me for my gracefully aging body."
You're picking now to get some self-respect?
- You once banged a blind girl by pretending to be Sean Connery.
Is-is Harriet.
"Look, I'm sorry."
- I lost my head out there.
- Look.
There.
"- No, no."
- I was just... but you can't go...
"I mean, we need you."
Harriet would never stand for it.
"Please, won't you reconsider?"
"You know, it's not about what happened outside tonight."
It really isn't.
But Golly...
"I just... no, I think it's time."
I really do.
"Harriet can take care of herself now, so she should."
But Harriet's just...
She's just a little girl.
"You know, it's the right thing."
"It's the right thing for all of us... for me, for you and for Harriet."
Are you sure?
"Yeah, I am."
"""'The time has come,"" the Walrus said,"""
"""To talk of many things..."
"""Of shoes and ships and sealing wax..."""
"""Of cabbages and kings..."
"""And why the sea is boiling hot..."
"And whether pigs have wings."""
Where you going to go?
"Well, I don't really know."
I'm thinking I may travel.
Are you going to go be some other kid's nanny now?
I certainly didn't lay a hand on her.
Ok.
Sorry.
Ok.
Step together.
*** together.
"Right, left, and turn!"
And pose.
I know what you're doing.
What?
Hanging out with my brothers and sisters?
Listening to a little live music?
"Look, I think it's nice and all, but I don't..."
Where were those dance moves when we were up there playing?
- Great show.
- You were awesome!
"It was amazing, really."
But we have to go.
We do?
We do.
"Good job, man."
- What'd you think?
- It was really good.
"Come on, you're a musician."
You actually know what you're talking about.
- Bring it.
- Uh... ok.
"Um, your energy was really good."
"The songs are good, but, um, I don't know."
"I don't think they were being articulated as well as they could be, I guess."
I know we're not as tight as middle school honors band.
You guys used to play together?
"No look now, she... she is back."
She's working at the Windsor Lockwood Clinic.
Why would she come back without telling us?
"If we're gonna start unraveling the mysteries of female logic, we're gonna need stronger drinks."
"The question is, knowing what we know about Jesse do you want to see her?"
"- Yeah, I guess."
- Good!
"I messaged her, she said tomorrow's fine."
Danny!
- Slade!
- Hey darlin'.
Hey Pru.
"Mark, hey."
So amazing to see you again.
"God, how long has it been?"
- 16 years.
- No that can't be.
"You're looking great, really."
So are you.
And I know I am.
"- Not a day older older, apart from... from the grays."
- What?
That's big news.
Are you OK?
"Oh, uh, fine, yeah."
"You know, it's a shock."
Hell of a shock.
We're working to find out more.
"Well Danny felt... and we all felt that since you were there that day, you know, you had a.... you had a right to know."
Well I thought about it a lot.
Every year on that day.
"I always remember the date, every year."
"Your satellite is on, by the way."
That screen is badass.
I just think it's asking a lot.
He knows it.
He's done nothing but apologise.
Is this gonna be every weekend now?
No.
It's just the end of the quarter.
You remember how that was.
"But I am earning double time, so there's a bright side."
So when the laziest boy in the world wakes up tell him he better wash those sneakers.
And I said bye.
And tell him to let them air-dry this time.
I don't want him banging the hell out of my dryer.
What?
"What, you don't even get casual Saturday?"
I mean...
"No, it's just you..."
You look nice is all.
"It's work, Walt."
And everybody is gonna be there.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Maybe we'll order a pizza tonight?
Okay.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Hi.
"You've reached Walt, Skyler and Walter, Jr."
"Please leave a message, and we'll get back to you."
Skyler?
Are you there?
"Okay, you guys."
"Well, this has just been wonderful."
"I am just gonna get my scooter and be on my way, so..."
[ Car beeping ]
"Thank you, guys."
I hope you have a great night.
[ Car beeping ]
Wow.
Get a room.
Wood:
"I did such a good job setting the mood for this guy, he was too busy getting busy to give me a tip."
"So I still only had $20, and I hoped Adam hadn't been doing any better."
Andrew #2:
I'm gonna throw this out to you right now.
Ferrara:
Go ahead.
"40 bucks, burnout right now, extra tip."
Do it.
You know what?
I work for you.
You work for me.
[ Tires screech ]
"Oh, I like it when you drink."
[ Laughs ] Hee-hee!
Nice work.
That was fun.
That was really fun.
That was [Bleep] Fun.
"All right, dude."
Ferrara:
Where else can you drive cool cars and get paid for doing a burnout?
"$40 richer, I headed back into the city for my next pick-up."
"- You have to go, Carlos."
"You can ruin your life with your muñequita, but you're not gonna ruin my bodega!"
"- You have to go, take the keys."
So I worked on a new color for this guy.
That's a great color.
I've got to show you something.
"I just finished these panels,"
I wanted to know what you thought.
"Jenny, go work on this."
"We'll talk about this, okay?"
You all right?
How you've been?
"Hey, Carlos?"
How have you been?
- You all right?
- I'm fine.
Fine.
"All right, what do you got here?"
"So, what do you think?"
It's good!
Good.
Good.
- I based that one on the old man.
- How is he?
He's fine.
Listen... can you show these to your friend at Gotham Comics?
"Who, Raquel?"
- Yeah.
- Are you sure you're ready?
"'Cause you only get one chance with her, you know that."
These are good.
Raquel:...which I assume is how you got the idea for this.
DAN:
Ha-ha-ha.
I'm just kidding.
It was just her engagement ring.
So why all the long faces?
-We miss Bull.
HARRY:
Yeah.
Nobody to carry the heavy files.
Or walk us to our car at night.
Hey. wait a minute.
Listen to the way we're talking.
All we care about is how this affects us.
We're supposed to be his friends.
Let's back him up.
"I mean, maybe he's made the right decision."
That's a lot of buffalo chips.
"No, Selma, I think Harry's right."
We've gotta support Bull.
We can't let him know how we feel.
I will not participate in this charade.
The man is making a fool of himself.
Somebody should tell him.
"All you have to do is have the guts to stand up to him and say, ""Bu||...."""
I'm behind you all the way.
"you big Greco-Roman nut, you."
Heh-heh.
Thanks.
I knew you'd come crawling back here where you belong.
-I just came back to clean out my locker.
-You should clean out your head.
-You know--
"Okay, ma'am, I need you back here too."
RAY:
"Hey, why don't you just tell us what we did, all right?"
BILL:
Keep your hands on the car!
All right.
"Okay, now, ma'am... (GUNSHOT)"
"Damn, goddamn right!"
"Yes, baby, yes, you motherfucker!"
Let's go.
Get into the car.
"Come on, now."
You motherfucker!
(TIRES SQUEALING)
"Hey Pluto, man, we're going the wrong goddamn way, man."
We're going back toward town.
Turn the goddamn car around.
Did I kill that man back there?
"Yes, baby, but you did a good job, don't worry about it."
I think I killed that man.
"Pluto, what the fuck are you doing, man?"
We're going the wrong goddamn way.
Turn the fucking car around.
PLUTO:
The car's been ID'd.
"The car's been ID'd, right?"
So we got to get rid of it.
"Yes, you killed him, goddamn it!"
You killed him.
Would you fucking turn the car around?
It will be stolen before the cops know.
We're going the wrong fucking way.
Come here.
Hey.
Don't worry about this.
Okay?
Everyone's gonna get over it eventually.
When?
"Nate, high school is over."
If I don't fix this tonight
Some of these people will never talk to me again.
And--and what happens next year?
What... she does this to the next
Serena and Nate and Dan and Blair?
Well.
What else can you do?
It is too easy for her to sit behind a computer
And not face the damage she's done.
No.
But she doesn't know that.
You didn't get to use your gossip.
Well here's something new--
I told chuck I loved him... again
And he didn't say it back... again.
Blair.
I'm not gonna tell people that.
Why not?
I'm giving you what you need to be queen.
I don't want to be queen.
I just wanted a chance to have a life in school
And look what it almost made me do.
That's the thing....
You need to be cold to be queen.
Anne Boleyn thought only with her heart
you cut some down and bundle it up for her.
they'll have me to deal with.
Tell the men that.
All of this in one day?
!
The man who owned the field was very kind.
He let me take all that I wanted.
And then he invited me to eat with him.
I think the others were very surprised.
Who was it?
What was his name?
Boaz.
Boaz?
You know him?
he is my nearest kinsman.
then... then he must marry you.
Get up for the Rams.!
"In the second half, Arthur tries to pick up where he left off."
Penetration move by Agee.
Slapped out of there by Manual.
They've got two-on-one.
"Ooh, and a nice fake and a score."
But it's the Rams who don't miss a beat... pressing the tempo against the tired Commandos.
You're not in the offense at all.
You're just out there playing individual basketball.
Completely.
"hey, hey, guys."
No fouls.
We want to keep the clock going.
Remember?
"Let's go, Marshall!"
Let's go!
Sarah and Tommy and Kevin.
- But understand...
- Justin and Kitty?
- They don't know.
"- Oh, God."
I didn't want this to be like the affair.
"I didn't want it to fester under the surface, haunting us."
Come on.
"- Oh, my God."
- What?
Where are you going?
- What are you doing?
- To find Kitty and Justin.
- Wait.
Please.
- No.
"There will be no more lies, Saul."
No more.
I won't stand for it.
"Nora, wait."
Are you sure?
How do we know Holly's telling the truth?
"As much as I'd like to, I don't think we can ignore the obvious."
"So, what are we supposed to say?"
"""Wow, we have a sister now""?"
"Justin, you don't have to say or do anything you don't want to."
This is just going to take time for us all.
So what?
Dad made Holly a beneficiary of the land because of Rebecca?
I don't know.
But I suspect that's part of it.
- Did he know that he was her father?
"Thanks, Mum, but it's okay."
"No, really."
I want to go to McDonald's.
"You know, I'm not really hungry."
Come on.
Are you telling me you couldn't murder a Big Mac?
Mum!
"Okay, another time."
Any time.
"I'll be around a while, you know."
By the following Christmas things were back to normal.
Before you came...
Every man is an island.
And I stand by that.
"But clearly, some men are part of island chains."
Below the surface of the ocean they're actually connected.
"So you're going to marry my mum, then?"
Don't know.
Why?
You think she's up for it?
- I used to want him to marry my mum.
- You serious?
Yeah.
But that was when she was depressed and I was desperate.
"Thanks, mate."
Cheers.
How do you use this blender-thing?
You don't.
I used to think two wasn't enough.
Christ.
Now there were loads of people.
And that was great.
No.
I'm here.
Guess Daddy doesn't love you after all.
We got the president.
Bring him on down.
"Back to your office, sir."
"I have John Cale on the line, sir."
Cale?
You put her on the goddamn phone right now.
"Hi, John."
They have the president.
"John, I want you to listen to me."
Help is not coming.
I said they have the president.
They called a strike on the White House.
The vice president is dead.
You need to get out.
They cannot do that.
"They still have hostages, they still have Emily."
"I'm so, so sorry."
I was wrong about you..
"but there's nothing you can do, John."
"If you stay, you're gonna die."
I need you to listen to me.
My little girl is counting on me..
and I am not gonna disappear on her.
So you tell me how much time I have.
You only have eight minutes left to get them out.
"Goodbye, Carol."
Clear out!
We're moving back now!
Everybody's gotta move back!
- Yes.
- You must be working part-time.
- Yeah.
Would you like some stew before you go?
I'm buying.
Hey...
How much could you make?
Hey!
How much do you make right now?
"- 6,030 won."
"- 6,030 won."
Please eat.
"But, you said... he was going around bragging about stabbing a man?"
"Oh, I think that was a lie."
But I think it's someone Han Gyul knows.
"It's Han Gyul, the kid that I fought last time?"
Not fought.
The one who beat you up.
"Hey, I didn't get beat up."
I fought...
I fought...
- Let's just say that then.
- Let's just say that.
But the suspect that Detective Im saw wasn't a young kid.
"He said that there were two men, in their late 30s."
Yes... yes.
So... you're saying that there's a young kid involved too?
"Then, Chan Gyu."
It could be... that Park Seon Woo committed this crime in two parts.
One stabbed him first.
Then the guys cleaned up after.
"And anyway, since it's true that he held that knife..."
- Promise me you'll be careful.
‭
"- Mom, I..."
I can't promise you anything.
I... have no idea what to expect.
I just know that I have to talk to him.
I have to hear what he's going to say.
- Does that make sense?
- ‭Of course.
(BIRDS TWEETING OUTSIDE)
(PHONE VIBRATING)
Hey!
"Emma, are you okay?"
Yeah.
I didn't mean to scare you.
"No, uh, it's just early."
"Um, what's up?"
My dad's back.
I don't know.
You're the only one who knew him before he left.
And I haven't slept all night and I'm totally freaking out.
Wow.
He just shows up...
literally when you get back to town?
How long has he been here?
I don't know.
I didn't interrogate him.
Doesn't it seem a little suspicious?
"You know, like, the timing of it all?"
"What do you mean ""the timing of it""?"
"Um, I mean, like, where was he when all of our friends, everyone we knew, was getting slaughtered?"
When you were actually in danger?
"Huh, I'll write it again."
My hand... my hand shakes sometimes.
You write it so it looks nice.
"I'm very sorry, I have to go before the soldiers come."
The last one...
the last one was about...
My memory isn't very good.
"No, I remember."
I went walking in the morning.
It was...it was very cold.
Tell her I wore my sweater.
She worries about that sort of...thing.
"And...and, uh... and I, uh, and I what?"
And I saw they had torn down that old building where you and the other children used to...to play.
"And, uh...what...?"
Tell her that it rained for two and a half days.
I don't know if she can see the sky... where they're keeping her.
And...there was more.
There was something about a friend...
I...
Why can't I remember?
I wanted to tell her!
Is all right.
She'll understand.
"Yes, yes, you're right."
She will.
Please let me come with you.
"I'm sorry;, thas not possible."
Check this one here!
Is there another way out?
Open up or else!
There.
Run these prints.
Get me an I.D. Now.
I spoke to Shane.
He said you weren't with him for about an hour last night.
Yeah.
That's right.
"I was with a private eye named, uh, Gordie Liman."
- What's he got to do with Tio and Armadillo?
- Nothing.
It's a private matter.
I'd rather it stay that way.
I'm happy to help you if you're helping me.
- Are you?
- I have been.
But I'm just about through.
I guess I'll have to figure this out on my own.
What the hell was that all about?
Nothing.
Why didn't you just leave it here and call 911?
- This dog was sniffing around it.
- So?
It's a bone.
The arm probably fell out of the Dumpster when the truck picked it up.
Call city services.
Remand the truck.
Have some unis search it.
The rest of her might still be in that truck.
"Alive, even."
"Lowe, did we I.D. the fingerprints yet?"
- There's a backlog.
- Backlog?
I cant find her if I can't I.D. her.
"Can you tell him, again, that I am trying to reach him?"
Of course.
Goodbye.
"Hey, thanks for meeting me here."
"Well, I thought we better speak face to face."
"Why, what is it?"
I checked the Brandeis account.
And?
"The Manovich money, the 30 million..."
It was in the account until a few days ago.
What do you mean?
It's gone.
Gone!
But that means that someone had to take it.
After Constantine died.
All of it?
Yes.
"If Constantine didn't take it, then..."
Christos!
He's the only one who had access to it.
What do you want to do?
I'm going to get some answers.
"Ok, cash or card?"
Cash.
Wouldn't want my husband to find out.
"No, those are going in the back."
You take all of those in the back.
"This is good, good, good."
I like all this.
"You know bushes, it's here is the important part."
"It's like, here,we want them, this is what they see, the rest is..."
Who looks back here?
"If you feel hungry, you can take it out and eat."
That's a good idea!
Master.
Come on.
Good!
"Thank you, master."
"Come on, don't mention it."
"Shit, I've stuffed my ring too."
"Foon, can you get my ring back for me?"
"Sure, master."
"This is chicken leg, my ring is still inside."
Not this one?
"Oh, it's full!"
"Master, would you mind looking for it yourself?"
Alright.
He's taking my bag!
"As it's stipulated by court, although it's not his wish to be baptized, we still welcome him to join God's family."
Let him go.
Why a woman's baptismal time is so short...
But a man's baptismal time is so long?
Why did you fight?
Your nose bleeds!
I didn't beat him.
None of his business!
Look!
I hate blonde!
I think it's acceptable!
Damn you!
Put all the dominos back.
As well as my mahjong too.
"And the chair and table, all set!"
What?
[Sighs]
Do they always talk about me that way?
"Oh, my God."
I shouldn't have played it.
"[Gasps] No, i-it's better that I know... who they really are."
"Martha, I-I've never... been any good at seduction or romance."
But I love the way you look.
I love every part of you.
"And if I could, I would go in there, and I would..."
"[Sniffles] I know you would, Clark."
But I have a job.
- A very important job.
- [Sighs]
And things are a lot worse than you know.
What?
Uh... have you ever heard of Stealth?
No.
"It's a huge, complex military project."
I don't understand it all... but there are a lot of leaks coming out... we think... of your office.
We've found it very difficult to find a source.
What do you need?
I so appreciate that.
I really do.
"- Let me help you, Clark."
"- No, it's dangerous."
I'm not afraid.
Do I love you?
You know you're everything to me.
And you to me.
[Sniffles]
You are.
What?
Am I as sexy and attractive to you as ever?
Huh?
Is this it for you?
Am I perfect?
"Well, ahem..."
I guess it wouldn't kill me if you lost a little weight.
Aha!
"Ok, and how much weight would it not kill ya for me to lose?"
I don't know.
50 pounds?
50?
All right!
Less!
Whatever.
You made me say it.
I can't believe you said 50!
"Doug, come on!"
You know I love you no matter-- ah...
This is-- this is unbelievable.
"You know, here I am walking around thinking everything's great."
"Meanwhile, you're smuggling in my clothes and hating the way I look!"
"No, I don't hate the way you look, ok?"
"But, yes, I admit it."
You could lose a little weight.
"But, Doug, come on."
I'm sure there are things about me you wish were different that you hold back on.
You?
"No, you're-- you're perfect."
"Yeah, right."
"Hey, look, when you start getting the old lady whiskers,"
"I'll let you know, but for now you're fine."
"Doug, come on."
"No, no."
No way.
I'm not gonna be a factor in that decision.
You know that there's no way for us to have a normal relationship.
"- You can forget about it, right?"
- OK.
There is a personal cost when you run for president.
"But as far as we're concerned, there's no reason why you and I can't be a normal couple."
How?
"Well, uh, for starters, we could try and sleep in a little bit."
- Is that what normal couples do?
- Mm-hmm.
What about this?
Yeah.
"Yeah, that's normal."
- That cannot be good thing.
"- No, no."
It's gearing up.
- Just give it a few minutes.
"- Wow, Holly."
It sounds like it's in its final death throes.
"No, no."
That's impossible.
It's brand new.
No.
My condolences.
Maybe we better read the manual.
- OK.
- How's your Italian?
L.A. Sucks.
I spent one hour on the 110 and I missed breakfast with Caitlin.
"Sorry, I didn't realize you had a guest."
"It's a chicken, they're female."
Silly me.
What's that?
It's your surprise.
- We're having a party.
- What's the occasion?
"It's my son's birthday, and I want to celebrate it."
"OK, Naj, do the honours."
"Three, two, one..."
You'd better come.
There's a problem with the vaccine test.
"For God's sake, be careful."
- How long has he been like this?
- A few hours.
- I should have been told!
- BP is going through the roof.
Oedema presence.
"At first we thought the vaccine was working, but then he started showing symptoms of the virus."
His immune system has collapsed.
This is my fault.
We're losing him.
"Hold him, for God's sake."
"The risk of contamination is too great, there's nothing you can do."
"Come on, get out, all of you."
"You too, Sami."
I'm so sorry.
You do what you like.
I'm not leaving him to die on his own.
Cut my throat!
Drive!
Samantha Willis live here?
Abby Grant sent us.
"- Bye, Mads."
- Why didn't he put on his trunks?
- What's he up to?
- What a nasty habit.
- You had his pecker in your face.
Swinging from side to side.
It almost hypnotised me.
- I always put on my trunks first.
- You owe it to your fellow man.
"Trunks, T-shirt, tie, socks..."
- I'm buying.
- Very well.
- It's good to see you happy again.
- I love being back at work.
It's done you a world of good.
Nursing Bodil was a full-time job.
- It runs you down.
- They take good care of her.
Gather all the retards in one place so we don't have to look at them.
"It's better to put them in a home, so we don't have to look at them."
- It's gross to watch cretins eat.
- Why do you say that?
Frank and I discussed it the other day.
What have we got here?
- Delicious.
- Congratulations on your new home.
- Is the bathroom finished?
- More or less.
Want to see it?
"Yes, please."
Casper keeps raving about it.
"- Very nice, Frank."
That's so mean.
"Look, if you don't take this chocolate and leave me out here, then I can't work with you."
Please give me the chocolate so I can pull you up.
Fine.
"Okay, Gene."
You hold onto me.
Got it.
"Tina, you hold onto me."
Great.
And then I'll hold onto something in the bathroom.
And pretend it's a person holding onto me.
Like a boy or an 18-year-old boy.
Okay.
We're ready.
Ah... no.
"Bang-up job, everybody."
We got the chocolate in the caboose.
Like we planned.
The only problem is is that we are not in the caboose!
At least we have toilet paper.
You guys want any?
Thank you.
Ugh!
"Well, we're stranded."
"Our chocolate's on the train, and there's nothing around here for miles."
"My boy-dar isn't picking up anything, either."
"Oh, wait..."
"no, that's a deer."
We've got to get back to that chocolate before somebody else does.
"Guys, we're gonna be okay."
The train's coming right back here.
"Wait, what?"
"Hey, come on."
"A little, you know--jesus."
"I mean, people with cancer, they have issues, franc."
Jesus christ.
"You know what I'm gonna do,"
"I'm gonna take a little bit of this, and I'm going to make a donation in mike's mom's name."
"Whoa, whoa, hold up.Before you give all our money away,"
- what kind of cancer are we giving to?
- Yeah.
"I don't know, ass, face, skin, brains, all of it."
- Cock?
- Cock and balls.Everything.
"All right, I'm in."
Sweet.
What about dogs with cancer?
"Hey, dogs are welcome."
"- All right, I'm in."
- Sweet.
Breasts?
Breast cancer.How about that?
"Oh, yeah."
"Well, what?"
"I mean, we're going to a titty bar."
"It's like an investment, you know."
"I got it, cat cancer."
"Titty bar made me think of pussy and, you know."
"All set downstairs, boys."
"Hey, derek, we're creating a special slush fund for cancer research.You want in?"
"Cock, tits, ass, animal, all taken."
What about the liver?
- I'll drink to that.
- Duh.
I decided to find out.
- How much is she on the rim f or?
- Sixteen thousand.
Let's see what I can do with the same numbers.
Did you ride in on the killing?
Her horse stumbled.
Give me the 7-11 dice.
They're all 7-11 dice.
It depends on the player's talent.
- Not the luck?
- l was returning your compliment.
"You shoot honestly, we give you honest dice."
Open up the table.
"You won't mind if I watch, I hope."
"Not at all, if you think you can take it."
- What's the limit?
"- For Mrs. Chandler, no limit."
We shoot 2000.
- Seven.
- Seven the winner.
- The 4000 rides.
"- Ad infinitum, if you wish."
Eleven the winner.
"7-11, your system, Dusty."
"Once more, and we're even."
- We'd better stop with what we have.
"- No, we'll get even."
The house will change the dice.
"That's your privilege, f riend."
That squares you with the house.
You think there's something wrong?
"I never think when I gamble, I just feel."
Oh.
Me neither.
I like to keep off the grid.
(Door opens and closes)
(Crow cawing in distance)
Yeah.
All right.
Let's do it.
Does this really seem like a good idea?
"I mean, mom won't even let me make toast."
"Oh, come on now."
Put her in drive.
There you go.
Now give it a little gas.
I'm so nervous.
"Well, there's nothing to be nervous about."
"Worst-case scenario, we both die, and that's gonna happen at some point anyway."
(Engine rumbling)
(Tires screech)
Okay.
(Chuckles) I'm driving!
(Tires screech) (Whispers) Driving.
"Okay, now keep your eye on the road!"
"Jeez, I learned that lesson the hard way."
"Hey, this is kind of embarrassing, but, uh, could you give me your name one more time?"
Is it... (Vehicle approaches)
(Brakes squeal)
"Hey, dad."
We had the best day.
"Uncle Rusty took me out of school, and we ate ribs, and I bowled a 39."
"I learned that I do not like beer, though."
Oh. (Laughs) He did pretty well.
She's mad at you now.
Has been for about a week.
- So is she...
- Pulling...
To the right?
Red 23!
"Excuse me, Miss."
Hi.
- You dropped this.
- Keep it.
Maybe you'll get lucky.
That's what I'm hoping.
Red 21!
Holy bananas.
You're really mad at me.
"- I feel sorry for you, actually."
- Why is that?
Because of all the things right in front of your face that you refuse to see.
Like what?
Like me.
"Oh, well."
I need to ask you a question that only the real Myka would know the answer to.
You know what?
"You're wasting time, 'cause Pete's in danger."
"Yeah, well, so are you, right?"
In danger if you're who you say you are?
"Okay, fine."
Here's what you and I both know but we never talk about it.
All right?
That I don't trust you.
That I need you to tell me the truth.
And to not treat me like some chess piece that you move around on a board that only you can see.
- We're not all bumpkins.
So I'm not under arrest?
You didn't steal anything.
You didn't hurt anybody.
No breaking and entering.
You've had trouble with him before?
Gordy and Denise?
No.
They're good people.
Things have just been a little strange around here lately.
You still haven't told me what you're doing here in the middle of the night.
I don't know.
Where am I?
Think you could show me where we are on the map here?
We're right on the state line.
With Ohio.
- What time did you leave DC?
1:00 in the morning.
"If I was doing 80 the whole way, it would've taken me six hours to get here."
- There's gotta be a logical explanation.
- I don't know.
"By the way, don't worry about your pal the governor."
I'll take care of it.
Yeah.
Okay.
"Thanks, Eddie."
- So?
"- It's running fine, Mr. Klein."
- Can't find a thing wrong with her.
- Really?
Strange.
"- All right, what do I owe you?"
Okay.
Bye.
I wish there was more we could do.
"Honey, you're his lawyer, not his guardian."
I know.
"I know, I know."
In the morning I'll take him to Child Service.
What kind of mother just abandons her child?
What happens if they don't find her?
He'll go into the system.
Foster care till he's 18.
"I mean, they'll try and place him, but...at his age, it'll be impossible."
You know what I was thinking?
"I think that this being your last night and all, we should do something special."
I don't know what.
Possibly get a couple of tattoos or some hookers and lose out virginity.
Ok ?
"Okay, dude, I don't know."
There's a shark movie at the IMAX.
If that's what you're into.
I just want to take it easy.
How was your swim?
It was great.
What's that?
It's a model home.
I build them.
"Well, the real ones, not that one."
Can you build me one?
Sorry.
Bad joke.
So...
"last supper, huh?"
"Oh, my..."
Do you guys seriously eat this shit?
"Okay, alright."
"Alright, saved by mum."
The best way to actually just stop her from calling is...
"I don't know, answer it."
"Yeah, it's kind of like a can of worms I just don't wanna open right now, so..."
She's worried.
You're her son.
"You've been travelling, and I just think if you speak to her, then..."
"Yeah, well, I still live at home with her back in Syracuse."
- That's cool.
That's fine.
- Yeah.
I was taking care of my dad.
"Oh, shit."
Is he...?
- ...okay?
"- No, he died."
"- Oh, my God."
I'm sorry.
- Last year.
"No, it's okay."
It was coming for a while.
It was early onset Alzheimer's.
"Oh, that must have been really..."
uh... tough.
"Yeah, he was my best friend."
Sometimes he'd just look at me and wouldn't even know who I was.
"Well, my mum, like, I don't even..."
I don't know how to talk to her.
"You know, I don't have that connection."
"AII right, but you gotta get over it."
So I unwrap the paper... and there she is... with her head held high and her ears perked up.
And there I am smiling.
What happened then?
"still, I gotta be the sad clown."
"A front for my friends, my family."
"You know, a brave front."
I've heard you describe yourself this way.
-About what?
"-Well, I do need a place of my own."
So I decided to take you up on your offer.
And which offer would that be?
To check out your apartment.
"Alex, it's nearly 2 in the morning."
But you said you were a night owl like I am and you walked me home an hour ago. I just figured--
What?
"Oh, my God. I'm sorry."
-lt's okay.
-No.
You know what?
It's not okay. I misjudged this whole thing again.
I'm-- l'm just-- l'm leaving. I feel terrible.
There's nothing for you to feel terrible about.
"Yes, there is."
Okay?
"Here you have this life, this great. wonderful life."
And I keep imposing myself on it.
You are not imposing.
I know that I am.
"You're not, okay?"
It's fine.
Please.
Max?
Do not touch anything.
- He will be seen.
- Why does not this display?
Please do not touch anything.
Stop it.
Please tell ...
Please leave.
I think this is display the information.
It will take us where is electricity.
We do not have to do this.
I have it.
Caught.
What the heck?
We're not going to New York.
What?
Where do we go?
Norway?
We're going to Oslo.
What is it?
Why are they doing this?
- I do not think that should be done.
- What did you say?
It can not be them.
What do you think of everything that is legal?
- Did you talk with co pilot?
- This is a competition!
Do you think that the network Social killing people?
I have to go to pilot.
There are people dying because we are breaking the rules.
We will follow the game no one else was hurt.
They can not kill everyone.
Ritzy.
- I really don't want to wear a corsage.
- They're all paid for.
- Really.
It's too much.
- Your mother wants you to pick one.
"- Really, it's okay."
She'll just come back here herself.
"- This one, thanks."
- Good choice.
The cameraman said that would look best on film.
- So you're the rich girl.
- Maybe.
I'm not rich... but my parents have money.
But I'm totally self-sufficient.
I take nothing from them except this corsage and my daughter's tuition.
"So, are you gonna stone me?"
I should've guessed.
Look at her friends.
They're wearing suits that drip money.
"Hey, pal, this was 30% off."
That's why you didn't want to get pizza 'cause it's below you?
"No, Liza."
Pizza is not below me.
I love pizza.
I eat tons of pizza.
It's one of my four major food groups.
"Candy, popcorn, and pizza."
See.
It's two of my food groups.
That's how much I love pizza.
I want to believe you.
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean that."
I didn't mean it.
I know that Alex wasn't just some guy.
"Oh, it's okay."
"It's my fault, you know."
What?
"Oh, I just think I need to take responsibility for my share in the whole mess."
You know?
I forced him into getting married.
"- You know, he wasn't ready."
"- Janine, this isn't your fault."
"No, it is."
"It is, I've changed."
"I was fun, you know?"
I was fun when we first met.
You're still fun.
[SIGHS]
We don't have sex anymore.
Lots of couples go through lulls.
"No, I mean we never have sex."
[JANINE CRYING]
"I mean, realistically, what do I expect him to do, you know?"
I don't think that's really...
"God, this tile is too small."
I have to tell Javier.
- What?
- This tile is too small.
I gotta go.
"I have to take a personal day, if anyone asks."
MARIEL:
"Well, my first husband was unimpressive."
I found him in bed with his big-breasted secretary when I came home early from the Maldives.
I feel a bit...
"- Yeah, yeah."
- Can you...?
Stop the car!
Stop the car!
Mm?
It's done.
So are either of the kids' fathers gonna turn up to this dance of theirs?
Abi's dad sends money and a card each birthday.
"Rob's dad, nothing at all."
I could come if you want.
To the dance.
They'd love that.
"They think you're great, you know."
Rob said you were cool.
Got some catching up to do.
"Like you said, you're not going anywhere, right?"
"They're good kids, Jess."
You've done a brilliant job with them.
I can't find my shoe.
I'll need it for the beach.
"This is freedom, isn't it?"
One simple rule worth remembering.
I call the shots.
"Not watching porn or playing one of your computer games, Calum?"
- I couldn't sleep.
"- Yeah, me neither."
"When we was in the car, my breathing went all funny."
I couldn't get air into my lungs.
It's panic.
And the best way of controlling that is singing.
"Sing to yourself - it controls stuff inside, takes your mind off stuff."
"I beg your pardon, sir, for barging in."
- Get out of here!
"- I'm trying, sir."
"All right, I'll see that you do."
Wait here a minute.
MacGregor...
What the devil are you doing?
- Do you want to know who I am?
"- Yes, I do."
"Well, sir, see, I'm from the London Bureau of Boats, Barges, Brigs, all tethered bottoms and maintenance of, sir... that's it."
Maintenance?
This place is condemned.
I'm the last one.
Lucky you are.
"If you've got wet rot on the top, you've got dry rot on the bottom."
- What are you talking about?
- I'll show you.
Look at that.
- What...?
- Oh!
I'll see what I can do.
I'll put my report in... and I'll try and get them before they close.
"I haven't got a cork with me, so I'll be back later..."
"Terrible thing, you've got there."
"Dreadful thing, that."
"Terrible mess you've got there, terrible mess."
- Madam?
"- Some knock-out drops, please."
- Some...?
- Knock-out drops.
- You want a pick-me-up?
"- If I did, I would say so."
You'd never met him?
"I've never seen him before this morning, hand to God."
"Look, the cops got it all wrong, man."
You know I would never do this.
You gotta believe me.
"You believe me, right?"
Yeah.
But it's not me you need to worry about.
"No, please, just don't tell Jackie."
"And it's not your sister, either."
Gibbs is my best agent.
Convince him.
"Tell him the truth, everything will be okay."
Minute's up.
No record.
This your first arrest?
First and only.
"I'm a good person, Agent Gibbs; ask Leon."
I'm not asking him.
I'm asking you.
"Well, I just meant he knows who I am."
He knows I'd never kill anybody.
Cops say they found you with blood on your hands.
I was trying to stop that kid from bleeding to death.
They said that you were asking skittish.
That you couldn't get your story straight.
They wouldn't let me talk.
I tried to tell them what happened.
They wouldn't listen.
They just assumed I was lying.
Okay.
I'm listening.
FRIENDSHIP
We don't have profound conversations.
I ask how they are doing but it's mostly just being polite.
If I really had a problem -
- I think they'd   quietly disappear.
I try to be just like them.
I try to be like them so they'll accept me.
It isn't really acceptable to be different from the others.
I've got loads of friends.
All over the world.
I go to L.A. I get in anywhere I want   because I know people and I'm friends with them.
With celebs and so on.
They've got money.
You can't be friends with people who've no money.
How did it go?
- Let's stop now.
- You can't stop now.
- It was your idea.
- A stupid idea.
I'm sorry.
When I hook a guy I won't share the money with you.
"Hey, baby!"
"Hey, Marc!"
- I thought you left with some guy?
- It's been a really lousy night.
Cheer up.
We're going to an after-party at Peter Skjoldmark's.
Have some Cristal.
Why are you always on booze and coke?
You're 26.
You need a wife and kids.
Send me one of your girls.
Delicious.
"High time, where've you been, Duke?"
"It didn't work, did it."
Elisa doesn't want me.
What did you think?
I told you so.
Save me!
"Help me, gracious witch!"
"Stop moaning, she's not the only Elisa around."
I said I'd choose a Lady for your palace myself.
Get up.
"My, you're heavy."
I wonder are you worthy of her?
"Call me Elisa, I don't mind."
What?
You?
Never!
No?
That's all right.
I can be the mistress here without you around.
You and your precious servant'll clean the place all day and every day for 100 years.
And I want everything to shine and sparkle!
That's what I get for my my tragic love!
"I know everything, move and fast or I'll turn you into six ugly green dwarfs."
No.
"Your Grace, you too?"
You're as heavy as a sack of grouts!
Come quickly!
"They'll haunt the castle at nights, they don't know yet!"
- But this is our...
-Elisa's!
They locked it up!
Huh?
Your attitude makes me sick!
What's the matter with you?
I'm talking to you!
If you don't take any advice... you'll never solve your problems!
I don't have any problems!
"- Oh, yeah?"
- You have a problem!
Sure.
Typical.
You are the problem!
Your obstinacy is my only problem!
- How come?
- You aren't reliable.
I have to smooth things out with Gerd!
"Sorry, but you got yourself into it!"
I don't get it.
You don't want to change a thing.
You only want to be left in peace.
Make an effort.
You know what's really ironic?
That you can't stand your father... but you say the same crap as him!
What do you know about my father?
I just have to look at you to know everything.
- What the hell's wrong with you?
- Leave me alone!
- You just want to hurt me!
- Then cry!
It's true!
You enjoy hurting me!
Ouch!
Are you crazy?
Look lively.
"A gent in box F wants you to serve him, and Old Prouty says you're to do it."
"Oh, he does?"
I'll tell him it ain't my business.
But he wants a bottle of the boil.
"Oh, bubbly."
Why didn't you say so?
"Hey, lvy, me love, how about some fish and chips after the show?"
How about a dozen oysters and a pint of stout?
What about a glass of champagne?
"- Oh, hello, Marcia."
"- Hello, lvy."
"Watch out, lvy."
"How's about it, lvy?"
"Over there, lvy."
Ain't she a bit of horseflesh?
"Well, that'll..."
"That'll be half a quid, sir."
Half a quid?
"Yes, sir."
Half a quid.
Here.
"Here's a sovereign, my dear."
Keep the change.
"Thank you, sir."
"Oh, but you're not going?"
"Oh, no."
No.
"After all, you brought two glasses."
Two minds with but a single thought.
"My, what a nice beginning."
Sit down there.
"Oh, God, I'm not pregnant."
I'm not pregnant.
That's ridiculous.
- Chug a beer then.
PAIGE:
"No, I'm not chugging a beer."
CATHERINE:
Chug a beer.
PAIGE:
"We're in love, you assholes."
"That's what people do when they're in love, they get married."
But you know what?
"Not everybody gets married, you know?"
There are many people who never get married.
"Well, thanks for the inspirational pep talk."
What she meant to say was that it's fine that you broke up with Neil.
Right.
Tons of people make the choice to be alone.
They're happy.
Look at Al Pacino.
"Never been married, happy as a clam."
Would that...?
Am I...?
Would I be Al Pacino in this scenario?
"No, Bethie, we just..."
We want you to be happy.
"Well, then you should have rethought the coral."
LAURA:
"Oh, her face."
- Your face.
- Don't make her cry.
I'm sick of these coral jokes.
That's all right.
Please stop this.
Please just come home.
"I have to do this, honey."
"No, you don't."
They have to pay for what they did to Kevin.
And when it's over..
I promise..
I promise you'll understand.
You're doing this for Kevin?
I swear to God.
Then you do whatever it takes.
You make them pay for what they did to our boy.
What the hell are you doing?
"Walker, you stop this.."
or I'll make sure she spends the rest of her life in a federal prison.
You have 19 minutes.
You're done.
General.
Your boss took the White House..
and your man inside got the president killed.
"Carol, calm down."
You're free to go.
Thank God for Gerald Ford.
Why?
He built this because he didn't want the press to see him in his swim trunks.
Any chance this leads out of here?
No.
"Listen, I gotta stop for a second."
What?
You all right?
"That's not good, is it?"
Oh come on Mile.
Nobody ever said that.
But they're thinking it dad!
Aren't you?
-Well I mean...
-Maybe a little.
"But hey, look, that doesn't matter."
I mean this is your life.
And we're just trying to make you happy.
Oh yeah.
Be nice and guilt me into telling the secret.
Well it's not gonna work.
"I just can't do it, okay?"
[Sighs] I can't.
[Door closes]
[Vocalizing]
"[Singing] The secret's messy, it's hurting Lilly and Jesse."
"Now she's all, now she's all."
"Poor little Miley's in a sad, sad place."
All because she has a secret.
"Now she's all, now she's all."
"Poor little Miley's in a sad, sad place."
All because she has a secret.
"You've had yourself quite a day, ain't you, bud?"
I seem to be having more and more of those lately.
Gosh look at me dad.
Being two people seemed like such a great idea back then.
Yeah.
That's because it was a great idea.
It gave you the chance to kind of...
"I know, live a normal life."
It doesn't seem to be doing such a bang-up job anymore.
Let me see.
Come on.
Turn around.
"You know, Bob, It's the third day of your diet... and that weight is just... falling off."
"- I'm, surprised you recognize me."
- Yeah.
- Something smells good.
What is it?
"- Oh, it's not for you, honey."
It's for the company.
I know you don't like lasagna.
That's why I made it.
"Well, if I don't like it, why does it smell so good?"
"- What, what do I get?"
"- Oh, it's over there on that dish."
It looks so lonely and so small.
Is this all I get to eat?
"Oh, no, honey."
You get a big salad with lemon juice and a big glass of water.
"Great. if I want seconds, I'll just, rattle my cup against the bars of my cell."
"Oh, honey."
It's not that bad.
You can have some of the hors d'oeuvres.
"Oh, good."
"No, no."
Not those.
The ones with the yellow toothpicks in them.
- The yellow toothpicks.
- Yeah.
"Oh, honey."
"I know it's rough, but it's worth it, isn't it?"
"- Emily, come here."
Yes.
Has this ever happened before?
No.
You've answered your own question.
But what if this 'Happily ever after'... becomes 'Happy never after' after some time?
You are right.
And you have a great track record too.
What if you get bored?
You are no Ms. Virtuous either.
Correct.
"Okay so the issue is, how do we trust each other?"
"So the issue is, is this feeling enough?"
- No..
- Then..
"The issue is, do we get this feeling with someone else or not."
Oh...
It's like a buffet out here.
So find some new fancy dish for yourself..
..and I'll find someone for myself.
And we'll know.
Hold on.
"Ideal bachelor, great catch."
- What are you doing?
This is too risky.
- Please.
Shiv.
Hi..
I'm leaving.
The things I've to do for her.
Just watch.
Same here.
That was a big mistake.
"Me, too."
I'm totally bushed today.
Good night.
"-Tomorrow, Iet's all go there and see."
-Go where?
See what?
Those two trees that committed double suicide by being struck by lightning.
Don't be stupid!
That happened a Iong time ago.
Those trees can't still be there.
I can't see them.
"Grandma told me they were still here, though."
Burnt trees keep standing forever because they won't rot.
There they are!
That's it!
Let's go and see.
Why don't we just look from where we are?
"I don't know why, but I'm a little scared."
"""Those two cedar trees look as if they have committed double suicide."""
"""We are two eIopers."
"""Why not live next to them?"""
What are you doing?
Sorry!
I just got carried away because of the mood.
Stupid!
I'm going back!
Wait a minute!
"Hey, wait a minute!"
What's wrong?
Something's weird.
An old lady from somewhere came to visit Grandma.
So what?
"Well, I've got $50 that says you can't get one past me out there."
What do you say?
Ls that a yes?
"You know, I've got the lowest goals against in Pennsylvania history, right?"
Wow!
That's really funny because I've scored the most in Pennsylvania history.
"Yeah, but for girls."
Come on.
Combined.
All right.
Let's go.
And this.
Let's go.
Give it to me.
Come on!
Let's go.
"Come on, you got better than that."
"Let's go, you're the MVP girl."
"Oh, man."
I could get you in a game.
You just need to be distracted.
"Trust me, watching you shoot in that shirt is distracting enough."
So?
Ls this feng shui hockey for real?
"We got gear, uniforms and our fees paid."
"And they can run the practises, but we'll still play the games my way."
- So lots of skating and no scoring?
- That is harsh.
"You open with the Hounds, Saturday."
Drop the Zen crap.
Control the blue line and put me on the roster.
Then you'll have a shot.
Let's go!
Follow me to a place.
Where?
Don't ask!
Just follow me.
- No way!
"- In case the baby is born, didn't you think about how miserable its life will be?"
You can not keep this baby!
- But what will happened to you?
- I'd rather be prisoned.
Absolutely not!
- I can not ruin your life!
- Shu Yawang!
"I will be prisoned, for 7 or 8 years at most."
"If you keep the baby, you will ruin the life of three person!"
"You, me, and this baby!"
I knew you would come.
"Qu Weiran, if just I'm not a soldier,"
I would have killed you.
Good then.
"When you kill me, Shu Yawang's unborn baby will be the bastard."
You bastard!
Good.
Kill me.
Go kill me.
Go away.
"Qu Weiran, live longer."
Make sure you do.
"Once you start a happy life,"
I will come to make sure you never can do it.
It is raining.
What date is it?
"They tend to be pen snobs, strictly Montblanc and beyond."
Why does he creep you out?
- He doesn't creep me out.
"- Yes, he does."
You get a bad vibe from the guy.
- It's complicated.
- Tell me.
I like complicated.
Ari does a great deal of independent reading.
You can see she's excited by the idea of fiction.
It's one of the things that makes her a good student.
- So you're taking my wife out.
- Uh...
Sorry?
"Well, you're going out with my wife."
"To, uh, some book event?"
"Right, right."
The book signing next week.
"An event for an author we both like, Leonard Addams."
Leonard Addams.
Do you...?
Do you think he's good?
I like some of his stuff very much.
"Ella's a fan, too."
"Well, I think he's a fake."
Very overrated.
He has his critics.
He certainly wouldn't fit in to what I'm trying to do with Aria's class.
Is he really your idea of a good writer?
"Well, I like a lot of writers for a lot of different reasons."
Hmm.
"Ha, ha."
See what they say.
- I don't have time.
What do you want?
Something I don't know.
They were tortured.
Were they raped?
I read your letter in the paper.
I liked it.
"If you catch me younger, I make you a hero."
It's a very rare film.
Not a common brand.
Imported.
I don't think many people around here use a roll like that.
I can find out who does.
But I want the photos of their cadavers.
From the autopsy.
I have a family.
I have to put food on the table.
Does your family know what you do?
My family thinks I'm the next Truman Capote.
He's an American writer.
Never mind.
Find out.
"I've seen your partner too, but I don't remember where."
Do you know if he ever worked in Vallecas?
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.
I'm sorry.
I found my daughters' bankbook.
My husband had it hidden in the car.
We found this in the glove compartment of your car.
"What's going on, Rodrigo?"
I'd rather keep this monkey - than ruin my life loving a man who plays Batman in ketchup.
Right!
I'll change my mind as soon as the dogs stop barking - the stars fall off the sky and the flames of the world are down.
Did you get it all down?
-He did.
"Women are like that, Jesse."
Your mother said the same when she left me.
I love Haitian manioki.
It's the best.
"I'd like to make a toast with you, Marie-Claude."
Perhaps we'll sing the national song of Haiti together one day.
You're wonderful.
"I don't know you, Dad!"
"-No, you don't."
Where's the toilet?
Pee out the window.
I should brush my teeth.
My fiancée has a cold.
"What's wrong with you, Mom?"
Go back to sleep.
This is it.
What's wrong with Jesse now?
He's so weird.
And you hate him.
Are you taking orders from children now?
You're nuts.
It's too late to regret.
-Right.
Did you say that she can see into my soul?
"Relax, Jesse, and let her look."
Don't hide from her.
"Relax, take it easy."
- I may pass out here.
"- No, you won't."
- Do you know CPR?
"- Uh, n-no."
You're gonna need to take my right arm and put it across my chest.
Okay.
Make sure I don't roll over.
Then what do I do?
You're gonna have to give me mouth-to-mouth.
I'm sorry I said those things about the way you live.
I was scared.
It's like Allie said--people get mean when they get scared.
All right.
"She's a wonderful girl, Lisa."
You did great.
"You want CNN here so badly, why don't you call 'em yourself?"
"Because they'd just think he was crazy, and he wants everyone to know that he isn't crazy at all."
( cell phone rings )
Yeah?
Okay.
The media'll be here in 15 minutes.
"We're almost home, fruit loops."
( gunshot )
( everyone screams )
Get down.
Who took that shot?
( cell phone rings )
What the hell do you think you're doing?
!
What'd you think would happen if you tried something like that?
It was a miscommunication.
I'm sorry.
- Is it?
"OK, OK, that's..."
that's just the wind.
Donkey!
And apparently it knows my name.
"That's very funny, Shrek."
But I know it's you doing this.
"Hey, I'm standing right here with you, Donkey."
No way.
"This place is not haunted by a ghost, and when the sun comes up, Donkey will be the new King of..."
"It's right behind me, isn't it?"
- Donkey.
"- Oh, my goodness!"
"Well, that's what I'd call a ""knight"" to remember."
What do you say we scare ourselves up some dinner?
I'd say... grab the kids and let's get going.
And that's why we're the Kings of Halloween.
He was so scared.
We probably won't see him for a month.
"So, what else have you got in your bag of tricks?"
I've got seven eggs.
Perfect.
I love this holiday.
"Oh, very nice!"
I am not happy!
Get your jacket off and get out!
"This season, on Hell's Kitchen:"
How dare you?
"If you don't get out, I'll drag you out."
Really?
It's the one you've been waiting for.
Thank goodness. I'm famished.
I forgot to have lunch today.
Make sure you get double cheese.
And get some of those little tomatoes daddy likes.
- Daddy can't be disturbed!
- What?
He's lying down upstairs.
"Here, get a large."
"Graham, what happened?"
is it Andy?
Nothing happened.
Do you feel all right?
Are you coming down... I just want to lie here.
How was your meeting with Rosenfeld?
It went okay.
Did you feel like you made all your points?
"Look. I want to tell you, and I will tell you how the meeting went... but I really just can't talk about it, now!"
Okay?
You know it's okay.
We'll live.
"You know I mean... we don't have to have this account, I mean the important thing is... I'm really sorry."
I have to get out of here.
- What?
- l can't breathe.
Graham!
"If you didn't land this account, that's okay."
Please!
"J ust let it be, okay?"
- l can't...
- You can't what?
What is wrong?
- Where are you going?
That's... pretty damn well.
"So, when you say you want a partner..."
"Yeah, that's not exactly true."
I don't want a partner.
Ah.
I want you as my partner.
I've heard good things.
I want to find out if they're true.
"If they're good, they're definitely true."
What scares you most?
Don't think.
Just answer.
Bees.
You know what scares me?
Mediocrity.
"Safe choices, hedged bets, a willingness to settle for the easy and familiar."
"I would really like to take back ""bees."""
Geez.
Married?
I didn't even know you were dating.
'Cause it's none of your business.
You don't tell me when you're screwing your stalker.
"Hey, careful."
They're starting to get too small.
"Oh, right."
Mr. big balls.
"I'm just saying, they're gonna dry out when you fry them."
I'm baking them.
"Oh, you're killing me."
"So, uh, how'd you get the kids not to tell me?"
Really?
The never mentioned Ollie?
How long have you known my mother?
About a year.
How did you meet her?
We just kind of met.
Are you going to see her again?
I hope so.
Would you like that?
I guess so.
"Hey, you wanna know a secret?"
What?
My father left us when I was your age.
You wanna know something else?
Made me realise what a wonderful mother I had.
You will realise that too some day.
What's that?
Monster ride.
Route six hundred and sixty six.
What's that mean?
"Well, a route is a road you take when you're on a long journey."
Can we go in?
"Well, Nicolas, maybe we should wait for your mother."
What for?
You're going straight to hell on route 666.
Ride here if you dare!
You're going straight to hell on route 666.
Look like someone had a bad crack up.
"Fill her up, cowboy."
"We wouldn't be eating in there anytime soon, Nicolas?"
"Eww, look at that."
You should close your eyes.
Jesus!
"- Boy, this is one heck of a ride."
It's just hard not to feel that everybody is when you' re lying in the street with a cop's foot to the back of your neck.
I've never seen it like this.
"It's okay, there will be a later bus."
Yeah.
"That's not your music, that's Abby's."
She always liked that noise.
I'm getting used to it.
There's an accident up ahead.
"Sit tight, we'll keep you posted."
- Thank
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
- Well...
"- Thank you for this, John."
- I know it's a huge inconvenience.
- It's no problem.
I'm sorry for getting so upset.
I hate being so pathetic.
Just the idea of going home alone and waiting...
- Eric will turn up.
- Yeah.
"Yeah, but I worry about both of them."
Abby's good.
"You know, we' re both good."
You don't have to worry about that.
She told me.
She told me you might get married.
- Is that what she said?
"- No, she told me you proposed."
"I know she's work, it runs in the family, but she's so worth it."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"He's on 6 grams a day, and he has a crazy idea of becoming a tattooist."
"He started tattooing some bananas, and then he got a roast pork   and now he's dragged half a goddamn pig into our living-room."
It's so gross!
"Go away, for fuck's sake!"
Get off!
What the hell's the matter with you?
Strange dogs.
The police was there!
You told me there'd be no police.
No police at all.
"- How should I know, honey?"
"- You don't know shit, man."
Asger?
Do you love me?
What are you talking about?
- Do you love me?
- Why the fuck do you ask me that?
It can't be that difficult.
"Do you love me, or..."
Shut up!
Right...
"No, she made it."
"No, she brought the CDs home."
And the washing machine.
They got Lars' stuff.
That's good for our business.
- We'll need some more soon.
- I don't feel well...
- Probably just your nerves.
"- No, I'm really..."
I really feel bad.
There...
He is free!
You came when I called to you.
I am free and you will sacrifice your bodies to me.
Come.
"You say nothing, but you speak to me with your minds."
"I will give you all my power, so that you may carry out your revenge."
You may go.
Now I am within you.
You have all of my power until sunrise.
"Once the daylight comes, you will be just as weak as you were before."
Go now.
You only have a few hours to carry out your revenge.
They're alive.
I saw them.
Poor things
"So, Louise, who did you see?"
Tell us what you know.
I didn't see anyone.
But I do know everything that happened.
That's the way I am.
I know things I have never seen!
I've heard about your gift of second sight.
Are they alive
- They're alive.
- Where are they?
Right here.
"- No, Bosco!"
- Calm down!
"Captain, stop him!"
"So there you are, my children."
You are very much as I imagined.
"Yes, I've seen you before."
"He's clean, Vi."
Come on then.
This isn't going much like the picture by...
"Yea, I know."
"204, 00:18:15,886 -- 00:18:18,094 I wish it would be more like a normal job."
Now it's weird!
"206, 00:18:20,016 -- 00:18:21,882 I never really talked to a job before."
Listen...this might be some kind of a test.
Everything is a test when you're a career woman.
Damn right .
And thoses dresses aren't going to buy themselves.
I got it!
What?
I know what we can do!
What?
"Why don't we just go in there, blast him without thinking about it ?"
"That way, we don't have to think about it."
"214, 00:18:40,911 -- 00:18:43,654 We don't even have to look either because we never going to miss at that distance."
"That's a good plan, Daze."
A real good one!
You think so?
Totally!
Cool.
But don't aim too high.
Why not?
We don't want to hit that little bird.
"Oh, yea, good thinking."
"Okay, ready?"
Ready!
Let's do it!
Who wants a snack?
"Be careful, they're hot."
Ariel?
Where are you going?
"Ariel, what are you doing here with this riffraff?"
I'm going to see Ursula.
"[Gasps] Ariel, no!"
No!
She's a demon.
She's a monster.
Why don't you go tell my father?
You're good at that.
But...
"But, I..."
Come on!
This way.
[Creatures moan]
"[Gasps, grunts]"
[Pants]
[Ursula] Come in.
"Come in, my child."
We mustn't lurk in doorways.
It's rude.
One might question your upbringing. [chuckles]
"Now, then, you're here because you have a thing for this human, this prince fellow."
Not that I blame you.
"He is quite a catch, isn't he?"
"Well, angelfish, the solution to your problem is simple."
The only way to get what you want is to become a human yourself.
[Gasps] Can you do that?
"My dear, sweet child."
That's what I do.
It's what I live for.
"To help unfortunate merfolk, like yourself, poor souls with no one else to turn to."
"So, one-way ticket to Peru?"
I'm hitting it.
Yeah.
Hey.
Yeah?
About what you said the other day.
I thought it didn't bother you.
"You know, Sam, I saved your hide back there."
And I saved your hide at that church...
And the hospital.
I may not think things all the way through.
Okay?
"But what I do,"
I do because it's the right thing.
I'd do it again.
And that... is the problem.
"Y-you think you're my savior, m-my brother, the hero."
"You swoop in, and even when you mess up, you think what you're doing is worth it because you've convinced yourself you're doing more good than bad..."
But you're not.
"I mean, Kevin's dead, Crowley's in the wind, uh..."
We're no closer to beating this angel thing.
"Please tell me, what is the upside of me being alive?"
You kidding me?
You and me -- fighting the good fight together.
[ Sighs ]
[ Sighs ] Okay.
"Just once, be honest with me."
You didn't save me for me.
You did it for you.
What are you talkin' about?
I was ready to die.
I was ready.
Cut it out!
Stop being a clown.
"He just got here, I'd Iike to see you in his shoes, if they treated you Iike that."
"Mattia and I grew up together, he's a good kid."
- But he can't insult me.
- He has an Oedipus complex.
personal problems can't be dumped on others.
You won't really report him!
I can't let it slip by.
It's like he's still a kid.
"Go along, I'II lock up."
"And tell Mr. VoIpe I'm sleeping at my house, even on the floor."
Mr. Director!
Where are you going?
- Home.
- It's the otherway.
We'II take you there.
- What'II you do to me?
- We'II take you home.
- See you tomorrow.
"- No, we gotta take you inside."
help!
What were you thinking?
Who's there?
- What's happened?
- Why are you here?
"Don't be afraid, we wanted to surprise you."
Each of us gave something.
"It's make-shift, but it's okay for a start."
It's wonderful.
It's beautiful.
"It's so nice of all of you, even pictures!"
"Look, there's a hotel across the road there."
"We could grab a room, really thrash this thing out."
(Laughs) It's not gonna happen.
No?
"Come on, well, why do you call?"
Why do you...
Why do you keep dropping in?
"Fine, I won't."
"No, I'm not saying that."
I'm just saying why?
Why?
I don't know.
And I can't stay.
"Oh, well, this has been a cracker day for me."
I'm only trying to get an innocent man off murder charges.
"I'm happy for the distraction, yeah."
I thought everyone you defended was guilty.
Do you remember that long weekend we spent together?
"Yeah, yes."
Son Of Astor paid for it.
Came in ten to one.
"I had you for four beautiful days, all to myself."
In the Margaret River.
"And I really slept there, didn't I?"
"Yes, you did."
"Yeah, it was pretty much all you did, actually."
Snuggled up and snoozed.
I didn't mind.
They had in-house porn.
Call me anytime.
It's looking a bit messy.
"Ah, Sal."
"Good night, Gordon."
It's been a pleasure.
- Thank you.
- Must you go?
"Well, yes."
I've got an 8:00 appointment at the office in the morning.
"Good night, Lynn."
Don't bother to see me out.
"- Good night, Dougie."
- Good night.
"I've been around long enough to know that you want something, honey."
What?
I want you to kill someone for me.
My husband.
Please.
I know who you are.
I've read all about you.
You don't know enough not to believe everything you read.
It would be so easy for you.
I could help you.
I'll pay you anything.
I'll be worth a fortune afterwards.
You're out of your mind.
You're lucky I don't slap you senseless for even suggesting it.
"Please, you've met him."
You see what he's like.
You can't imagine what it's like living with a man like that.
I want him dead.
You've got to help me.
I don't have to do anything.
"Got the wrong guy, honey."
You better forget the whole thing and just hope that I do too.
What?
You know.
The ones with the drugs that make you go crazy.
His blood was full of that shit.
And there were tons of dried mushrooms at his place.
You really believe that?
It's what the results said!
Didn't you ever try those mushrooms as a kid?
Hell no.
"All I know is, mushrooms don't do that to you."
You saw that poor guy.
Mushrooms would never make you that way.
But I'm right about the Japanese guy.
"If everyone's talking about him, there's likely a good reason."
What the hell?
Power's gone out again.
Fuck.
I keep telling the Captain to get that damn wiring fixed.
Never listens!
What the fuck!
- What's wrong?
- What the Christ was that?
- That thing outside.
- What's outside?
"- Outside, that... fuck!"
- What's your problem?
"What is it, man?"
You check it out.
- Me?
"- Yes, you!"
Dammit.
You want me to go out?
The sooner the better.
Oh.
I'll have him sent down here.
SKEETS:
"Yes, Mrs. Brendan?"
"Skeets, would you have Wilbur Hoolick sent to my office, please?"
Wilbur will be delighted to see you.
He'll be surprised to see me.
Gee!
"""Majuba diamond murderer."
"Police baffled."""
(MAN WHISTLING)
Wilbur's the killer!
"Boy, these straight razors sure do the job, boy."
"You know somethin', Mike?"
I want to thank you.
"You've been very, very helpful to me, and believe me when I tell you, I ain't gonna forget you."
You won't?
No.
"(STUTTERING) Well, I mean, I'd just as soon you would."
"What do you mean, pal?"
"We've been buddies, we're friends."
What do you mean forget you?
"And the gang back home, they'll love you."
But I'm too young to be with a gang.
"Yeah, maybe you're right, kid."
"Yeah, well, maybe we'll give you a few years."
"Wait, Willy."
Wait just a minute!
I won't tell on you.
Please!
"Please, don't kill me!"
Are you crazy ?
It's Jimmy Cooper's flare gun.
I found it in the hall closet when I was looking for rain gear.
"Yeah, but it's not raining."
"Well, this was last November."
What ?
"Jimmy doesn't need it anymore, and it's cold, and it's shiny, and it feels so good in my..."
Here.
You try it.
Eww !
I'm not touching your pistol.
That is stupid and dangerous.
"Oh, my God."
Go 187 on that zombie ass.
It's in the kitchen.
Follow me.
Stop or I'll shoot !
"Oh, my God !"
I've been hit !
Mom ?
Taylor... you shot me !
sorry
I came here because I was worried about you.
"I know, Mom, and it really means a lot to me that you did."
"Save it... that's the last maternal instinct I'll ever have, since you shot me."
It was just a toe nick.
You're totally fine.
Until sandal season !
"Taylor, I'm going to have to see a plastic surgeon right away."
"I already told you, there's no way to get you to the hospital."
You're just going to have to tough it out !
Pancakes is hurt !
And since when ?
"Well, here's the kicker."
She disappeared 5 years ago.
5 years ?
Jesus-Christ !
"My brother went missing, too."
When he was 5 years old and... we've never seen him again.
It's hard on those that left behind.
you know.
"You've been missing for a really long time, Gemma."
Where have you been ?
Were you with someone ?
Did someone take you?
Were you hold against your will ?
You can tell me.
Nothing bad is gonna happen to you.
We'll do everything we can to help you.
Were you held?
Can you tell me where you've been?
Not just me.
I'm not the only one.
There are more.
More?
I mean how many?
What are we supposed to do about that?
Tread carefully.
The last thing we want to do is to freak her out.
We'll do just one piece of information at a time.
"No, this is massive."
You know maybe Pru was right.
Maybe we need to get the cops in on this.
"- Tell Danny, at least."
It sort of wobbled as well.
They'd come in their triangle car.
"HUMS ""Roobarb"" THEME"
You have had a reputation as what I would call a party animal.
Is that fair?
"I do like a party, yeah."
Who doesn't?
"I've seen you photographed out and about on the Camden scene, staying up beyond midnight."
Is this true?
Ten past one.
That's my record.
Don't you feel terrible the next day?
Yeah.
You mean the day after the next day.
The next day you're still up.
CHEERING You feel good the next day.
"Well, what...what would a typical evening involve if I came along with you?"
"If I rang and said, ""Noel..."" You pick it up by mistake."
"""It's Rob."
Hi.
You came on my show.
"""You said we could go out to Camden together."
It's half six now.
Em...
"""I've left it a bit late."
I've just had my dinner.
"""Where shall we meet?"" Where would we meet?"
I don't know...
LAUGHTER
In a forest.
I'd send someone out for you.
Now your new show is even weirder than the Boosh.
"Yeah, tell me about it."
That's my wife Olivia.
"Awesome, bone structure."
- She's lovely.
- Glad you think so.
We were hoping you'd join us for a drink back at our place.
"And your wife, is she okay with that?"
"My wife is an Erinys, a Fury."
I wouldn't flirt if she didn't give me say so.
"In fact, you're her choice, and I wholeheartedly agree."
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't know.
"Girl, are you a Succubus or a succu-bust?"
A rebound screw is the greatest way to get over a guy.
-It's just science.
- I told you.
I never cared that much about Dyson anyway.
My place.
Let's go.
It's coming ...
We're gonna need a safe word.
Gold star for Kenzi.
Rebound sex was exactly what I needed.
Why do you look like you're not at all sharing this monster hangover?
What can I say?
"For me, sexual healing is a literal thing."
I hate you.
And there's no strings attached.
- That was the best idea you ever had.
- You're very welcome.
And you're back.
His blood was full of that shit.
And there were tons of dried mushrooms at his place.
You really believe that?
It's what the results said!
Didn't you ever try those mushrooms as a kid?
Hell no.
"All I know is, mushrooms don't do that to you."

- What's your problem?
"What is it, man?"
You check it out.
- Me?
"- Yes, you!"
Dammit.
You want me to go out?
"I'm telling you, asshole, to get your ass out there!"
For crying out loud...
"Okay, I'll go."
Pack up the clothes.
I'll go get a bag.
Does she like Seo Yoon Jae that much?
What's with these clothes?
Is this a key to this house?
"No, it's not."
I wonder if it's a key to our newlywed home that we've signed off on?
What do we do?
Just be natural and answer the call real quick.
What?
-Hello?
"-Hey, Yoon Jae."
It's Se Young.
The doctor friend that you saw.
Do you know how worried I've been because I couldn't get a hold of you?
I heard you've been in an accident?
I found out when the hospital received your belongings.
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
Uh...
I'm fine now.
I thought so...
You were being weird earlier.
I'm coming over right now with your stuff.
"I'm close by, so I'll be there soon."
Okay...
She says she's coming here.
That's good.
I didn't think to get Yoon Jae's belonging because I was too out of sorts.
I guess she's bringing it back for you.
What do we do about Yoon Jae's job at the hospital tomorrow?
Do I have to go to work?
You can't do that.
"Sorry to call late, cock."
I was up.
I just needed to hear a friendly voice.
It's been one prick of a day.
Yeah?
"First, Lorton."
And then-
"One of the many things Scarlet hates about me is my inability to lose my temper, so I won't even try now."
"But let's have nothing more to do with each other, OK?"
"Barn, what the hell are you- Ask Scarlet about John Bartrop."
"You were joking about him, remember?"
In the alley where Ben Rigby was killed.
What'd you call him?
A puff of wind in a mohair cardigan?
"You know, even when you're destroying lives, somehow it still comes out as a bloody joke."

Mr. Fisk is backing a show.
Miss mansfield is an actress.
That's all there is to it.
"I've known miss mansfield as long as he has, and i've never known a finer woman."
"No, malicious gossip isn't news."
"I don't think your papers want to print it, boys."
"Thanks, mr."
Boyd.
That's good enough for us.
Yeah.
Thanks.
No offense.
"Good night, miss mansfield."
Good night.
"Thank you, nick."
"That's all right, josie."
What else could i do?
Did you really mean what you told them about me?
No.
I was thinking of jim.
"Ever since i've known you, nick, you've been fighting me because of jim."
"You knew how he felt, and you didn't want to hurt him... so you tried to hurt me."
And you succeeded for a while... till i discovered the reason.
What is the reason?
You're in love with me.
I'm in love with you?
"Why... what do your guests think about all this, mr."
Taylor?
I haven't got any guests except mr.
Drew and colonel fisk and his soldiers.
I don't care what they call the place.
He wouldn't go to the hospital.
Of course he wouldn't.
"It's like an anxiety thing, you know."
- He's okay.
"- He's fine, okay?"
I'm sorry.
I really didn't mean to scare you.
"Jesus, Patty."
I'm sorry.
Look.
"Uh, the reason-- the reason why I'm-- I'm here is, um... you seem to be the only person who knows how to ground him."
And he could really use that right now.
"So if there's anything that you can do,"
I just-
- I'd really appreciate it.
Okay?
Why are you doing this?
What do you mean?
This case.
Why are any of you doing it?
It's destroying him.
It looks like it's destroying you.
My mom is acting like a complete crazy person.
"Okay, with all due respect, your mother's not my fucking problem."
Okay?
"And, uh, no one's getting paid for this."
So I don't know why the fuck we're doing this.
"But... everyone needs a reason to wake up in the morning, and it's a pretty good fucking reason."
"I'm having a day, okay?"
Okay.
So... are you in?
- Of course.
If I didn't know better....
"-We're off the record here, Albert."
-We're off the record?
It's Tony.
What?
Am I wrong?
Honestly?
I don't know.
Take a leak.
"This is bad, my friend."
"I mean, don't get me wrong."
I wouldn't piss on this Ralph if he was on fire.
But to whack the guy over a horse?
How fucked up is that?
"If it can happen to him, it can happen to any of us."
What's next?
You get clipped for wearing the wrong shoes?
What can you do?
Tony's the boss.
Centuries of tradition here.
Exactly my point.
If Tony did do this... whack Ralph over a fucking horse... that guy would be the first guy on line to pull his fucking plug.
I think Justin recognized me a few minutes ago.
Thank you.
"Come in, he's getting dressed."
I'll wait in the car.
"Well, welcome back."
I bring presents.
Really?
That is so sweet.
"Also, for the grownups, I bring some of my uncle's wine... but it's come later."
I just made some coffee.
She'll take it from me.
But that's not your money.
I must pay for the identity card.
The fun costs 600 Marks!
Why haven't you taken care of it long ago?
- Without any photos?
I need to have her photographed.
And you wanted her to be a witness.
Now don't get worked up!
"But, Bruno, she'll wake up."
She must go away before she gathers her wits.
We can't let that happen!
And I know exactly what's awaiting her when she realizes.
And that is terrible.
I feel... as if it were me.
Attention!
"Photographing now, Miss!"
The camera will click shortly.
What's the matter?
You're not at the dentist's!
Why the sad face?
A passport is not a wanted poster.
It's not so bad.
"Please, a bit more pleasant, Miss!"
Well then!
...
Well then!
...
See?
"When you smile, you look quite pretty."
"Excuse me, please!"
It almost makes me sorry that I must get you an ID card today.
"Yeah, we are all fine."
Can?
"No, that's not what I meant."
I was going to go to the army recruiting center... a German photographer was studying my art.
Are you a faggot?
Did you apply foran exemption?
Would you like coffee?
I want to take you to Germany.
What would I do there?
You'll stay with me.
My house big.
I'll do everything for you.
The military won't let go of me.
What kind of photos do they want?
Holy shit.
Disgusting.
They must really enjoy this.
"Sukran, could you make tea for us?"
I really don't like what I'm hearing.
You guys will drive me crazy.
"Between my mom, the cops and no job."
We haven't even paid the rent.
Why?
It's been paid.
How?
Here.
Did you pay it?
Don't I live here?
How many times have I told you?
Enough!
I support this house.
I am not a sponger.
"It's because our half brother is here, isn't it?"
He's helping you.
"Oh, it took you a while, but I'm..."
I'm just...
"I'm so proud of you, Duvie."
Just let it in.

Is that so hard?
Are you listening to me?
Are you listening to yourself?
I wasn't talking to you.
That's the problem.
You're not talking to the right person.
"You know, it's been a long time..."
Since I could do this.
I've never been able to do that.
"Look, I got it, all right?"
I got it.
You want me to talk to my son.
He'll accept who you are.
You saw it.
- He's almost there.
- That's the problem.
"If he accepts who I am, he'll want nothing to do with me."
You'll cripple her!
She was swimming when I came.
Swimming?
Don't cry.
- The yokel.
What is it you want?
"I'm a miller's apprentice, I'm looking for work."
I mean for a roof over my head...
Where did you work last?
Here and there and everywhere!
"I know who he is, Froggy!"
"I heard you need a helper, so I came."
"We do, but are you any good?"
You don't look like a hard worker to me.
But I am!
And I can sing and dance!
"It's him, I smellt him, it's him!"
- You wait!
- You...
Haven't we met before?
You look familiar.
Impossible.
"We have a new helper, what do you think?"
"Why, daddy?"
I can get my work done.
I don't want a stranger around.
"Beautiful E- er, you'd work herself to death you need a helper I can do all sons of things,"
you won't be sorry.
All right.
We'll give him a try.
"There's plenty to do, even with our two helpmates."
"A devil and watersprite, like in every real mill."
And we'll be here for you when you get out of rehab.

"I mean, look at all these weirdoes."
I sold my penis for meth.
I got drunk and had sex with my boss's car.
I huff propane.
"And the worst part is, I only took those pills so I could go on that Commodores Gold Record and All-You-Can-Eat Jumbo Shrimps Cruise."
And now I can't go.
"Just don't think about it, C-bro."
Kind of tough not to think about it.
"Hey, what're you guys looking at?"
"No, Shrimpy Dave, don't look!"

Maybe they got lost and they lost my phone number.
It was just a big joke on me.
I'm such an idiot.
No one wants to be friends with me.
I am sure there's some explanation.
"Get real, Grandma."
I'm pregnant and I'm new at the school and no one wants anything to do with me.
And I knew it was going to be that way going into this.
"Honey, don't say that."
"And, of course, I blew it with Ethan because I was the ""b"" word to him."
Bitch.
"Yes, I'm just surprised you said ""'b' word."""
"You have a tendency to use foul language, which I'm not completely opposed to when it's called for."
Why don't you call him?
"Oh, I can't."
I'll call him.
"No, it's stupid for me to have a boyfriend."
It's bad timing.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
I already called him.
Stay off the bed.
"Or the one she's on, anyway."
"So, mind if I come in?"
I guess not.
I told you those two weren't nice.
Mom taught me.
Your mother was a great student.
She'd be...
I want to go back to the circus.
I want to go home.
Let's get Quico out of bed.
I'll take you to the beach.
"No, I want to go home."
Eat your bread.
What are you looking at?
Nothing.
Do you see anything?
I'mjust looking.
"Maria, when you're back in the circus someday, can you take me along?"
I want to see you walk the tightrope.
"Look, Marcia."
I made this for you.
It's beautiful.
It used to be my favorite toy.
"Whenever it rained hard, I set it in the water to watch it float down the gutter."
I stared as it floated away.
Take me to the circus.
What about your mother?
She can't tell me what to do anymore.
Going back still scares me.
Maybe it's best if I keep as a painter.
You're an artist.
You belong in the circus.
"Young man, I regret to inform you that this love will not last."
"How do you know, mom?"
Have you ever truly loved someone?
"Mom, dad!"
Anything I can do?
"No, thanks, Frank."
[GUNFIRE]
They'll be blasting it open pretty soon.
"Stacey, the riot's a bust."
Get back in your cell while there's still a chance.
"No, won't do me no good now, kid."
"I still got that Limpy rap hanging over me, even though it was-- [EXPLOSION]"
It wasn't my job.
I wouldn't appear against you.
I know it.
"It's no use, Frank."
This is the last roundup for Stacey.
[GUNSHOTS]
But there's still that unfinished business of yours to take care of.
It's still okay.
Where's Polecat?
Over there.
I wanna talk to him.
Didn't I tell ya I had a surprise for ya?
Come on.
I ain't got no time to waste.
"Funny, just an hour ago, I had 199 years."
And now I ain't got no time at all.
I'll get the rat.
[GUNSHOTS]
We got an affidavit from Shake Edwards before I came back in here.
What about those guys who framed me?
Did you get them?
Yeah.
"Well, rat."
So it caught up with you.
"I know it's rough, man."
"I get it, you know?"
"He's your best friend and all, and you miss him like hell."
"But know this, he will never apologize to you."
- And he will never say that you're right.
"- I appreciate the concern, George."
I really do.
It's funny.
I always thought you didn't like me.
"Point is, you gotta stay strong."
We can't enable.
We gotta wait until the right time to let a person like that back in our life.
[yelps] Oh!
Shit!
[mutters] Fuck.
[knocking on door]
- Hi!
"- Hey, man."
"What's up, man?"
"Come on in, I was about to put a pot of coffee--"
"Oh, buddy, are you all right?"
You look a little torn up.
Yeah.
First time I've been in town and just-- kind of a lot of feelings and--
"Like, a big hole's opened up."
"Yeah, I guess."
You want some tape or something for that?
"Oh, yeah."
"No, if by ""something"" you mean a clean pair of pants?"
- I didn't realize we were winking.
"- Yeah, dude, we're winking."
Oh!
"- No, that was..."
"- I love ""Dawson's Creek."""
Listen to me.
I'm so happy.
And I think I just got worried that this part wouldn't work.
What are you talking about?
You haven't seen this in a while.
"Emma, I can't wait to see this."
"I know, but things are different, you know?"
They're a little wider and longer.
You think this isn't different?
"- Come on, man."
"- Look at this, look at this."
That wasn't there before.
That's something to grab onto.
Get your hands in there.
"Get a hold of that, see?"
"- All right, all right."
- How about this...
This mole here?
"That's new, that's interesting."
You should get that checked out.
"And, I'm sorry, check out these chicken legs, right?"
I'm just going straight chicken leg situations.
It's a two-piece meal.
"So yeah, it's different."
"But have you ever thought that it might be... much, much better?"

"Mags, mark and I did it!"
We did the sex!
You should disinfect it.
"Yeah, later."
"You know, earlier with the coroner, maybe I went too fast."
You weren't too hot for the idea.
"No, it's OK."
I'm sorry.
You didn't want to.
"Not really, no."
What is it?
"well, you know..."
I'm retiring in 3 months.
"Yeah, so?"
This case looks complicated.
"I might still have to go to court in 1 , maybe 2 years after I retire, so..."
We started and that's what counts.
You sure?
"Yeah, sure."
Found anything interesting?
"Yeah, actually..."
"Come, I have a question for them."
Who wears high heels?
We found fresh tracks.
"we just need to take prints, it'II be easy to find."
"He must be talking about the girl, the dancer."
The dancer?
What dancer?
You never mentioned a dancer.
"He didn't see her, she stayed in my truck until he left."
"When he came back, she had gone back to the hotel."
What's her name?
Samantha... so she said.
"A cutie, fully equipped."
Blackjack's a great game.
"No, look, it's easy to learn and there's really not as much strategy to it as people think."
"I grew up on it, actually."
- You grew up on it?
- Yeah.
"Every night after dinner, my father and I would play."
"I knew basic strategy before I was, like, nine years old."
"If I won, he'd take me out for ice cream."
And what if he won?
He'd still take me out for ice cream.
"Oh, yeah."
"Sure, yeah, he's your dad."
"Ben, you should feel the thrill of winning more money than you can possibly imagine."
I think you should come to Vegas.
'Cause I'm guessing that you could probably use a break from this place.
I can't.
I'm sorry.
I just can't.
Okay.
"If you change your mind, you know where we meet."
Yeah.
You're welcome any time.
"You know, I think the best thing about Vegas is you can become anyone you want."
- What's the count?
- Plus 9.
- No.
- Plus 11.
No.
"- Dude, I lost count 20 cards ago."
"- Don't call me ""dude."""
- Plus 9?
- You're just following Jill.
–Nothin'.
"Hey, it's cool."
You can tell me.
No.
It doesn't matter.
I gotta get back.
"Seeing the way you stiffed your partner, I figure you're just one big hard-on today."
–Excuse me?
–You know what an officer-involved shooting means?
It means that we're all involved.
–I told the truth.
–When it comes to your partner's career... the truth is like grits.
You don't serve it up plain.
You put a little salt on it.
You goddamn rookies.
$20 apiece.
I'll let 'em both go for 35.
That's real...
That's like chiffon.
And this look good with your eyes.
And this is silk right here.

"Drop the clothes, ladies."
"Although, you have got to have that one."
–She's keeping that one for free.
–Wait...

"–Oh, yeah?"
That's funny.
I got a police report for it from Dress For Less.
"Dealin' stolen merchandise, Taylor."
We only went to dinner and then a movie.
"Harriet is not your daughter, Miss Golly."
"She is mine, and you have no idea, none, what it is like to come home and find"
- that your child is missing.
- We had no idea that you'd be home this soon.
I don't care.
I don't care what you did or where you went or why.
All I know is this can never happen again.
Miss Golly... you are fired.
What?
!
No!
Just a moment.
This is my fault.
Please.
"Well, it seems awfully sudden."
Actually... maybe it's not.
"I think you're right, Mrs. Welsch."
It is time for me to go.
What?
What?
What?
"Now, look, I admit, I lost it... because, I just..."
I was frightened.
"But the thing is, the fact is we need you, Golly."
We can't do it alone.
"We all spoke out of turn, I think."
None of this is causing...
Absolutely not.
"Absolutely, no."
"I mean, I think we were talking about... our feelings out there."
"You were afraid and-and-and now what we should be focusing on, right?"
What?
- Don't you dare.
- What would you have me do?
- What would you do?
- Not this!
That's not an answer.
That doesn't help me.
I cannot let this fail.
It just has.
You're wrong.
"You've got what you wanted, so you can stop now."
It's OK.
"It's all right, you're all right."
You returned what you stole.
Your sentence is commuted.
Justice and mercy.
This is our law.
"You know, we're totally confident."
I've looked closely at the vaccine research and it's impeccable.
There's nothing at all to worry about.
And I'd like to thank you for your courage.
We're not the only ones.
There are survivors everywhere.
"People live, you know?"
The thought of Davy being alone.
That finishes me.
The rest...
It's a good life.
Thanks.
We'll bring the car back.
"Looking for her son Peter, 12 today."
There's an estate called Waterhouse.
"I was thinking, ""How am I gonna back up?"""
I don't even know how to drive forward on a stick shift.
- I can't believe you left her there.
- I can.
Good.
I think that's the first time anyone's sympathized for her character there.
People cheer.
I love how she checks her boobs to see if there's something wrong.
"Her boobs must be misaligned, that's why he backed away."
- That's so funny.
"- It's so sweet, though."
That's so funny.
"- Mike, you're..."
This is terrific.
- This is a great moment.
This is really late.
- Oscar.
Oscar.
- Right?
Really late.
"- Yeah, it's probably 5:30, 5:45."
"- Well, maybe a Golden Globe."
Look how great.
That was really me doing that.
I really actually did that.
"Mike, you're a handsome act..."
Good actor.
I just want to sum this up.
"If you wanna give us any compliments, feel free."
"- Yeah, go for it."
- You guys are handsome.
You're so good.
It's displaying that he is just in the car in front of yours.
"Varun, what are you doing?"

I'll kill her!
Listen.
- Hey!
Don't do anything silly.
Don't move.
Everything will go in vain if you go there now.
We can't prove anything with what we have found out so far.
Have some patience.
She has a new scapegoat.
All we have to do is to catch her red-handed.
At least we have to know what they are talking
Or do you want to sit here and issue parking tickets?
Let's do that also.
Give me the Bluetooth earpiece.
Why?
"- I'll tell you, give it to me."
Wait here.
Where...
Juice will do?
Hello.
"- Yes, Sadhana."
Don't talk.
Stay on line.
"Had you not been here, I would have helpless."
How will I ever repay you Vikram?
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
- Hey.
Why are you so formal?
-What shit are you talking about?
-Just stay away from the garbage.
"I'm not talking about what you did inside, you did what you had to do."
I'm talking about now.
From here and now.
-Why would I get into that?
-Don't make a jerk out of me.
Just don't do it.
Don't do it.
I want to talk about Jimmy.
Watch out for him.
"He's a good earner, but he takes too many chances."
I wouldn't take chances like Jimmy.
"Tommy's a good kid, but he's crazy."
He's a cowboy.
He's got too much to prove.
-You got to watch out for them.
-l only use them for certain things.
I ain't going to get fucked like Gribbs.
Gribbs is 70 years old and he'll die in prison. I don't need that.
So I'm warning everybody.
"Could be my son, could be anybody."
Gribbs got 20 years just for saying hello to some fuck who was selling junk.
"That won't happen to me, understand?"
You're out early because I got you a job.
I don't need this heat.
"You see anybody fuckin' around with this shit you're gonna tell me, right?"
.
That means anybody.
-All right.
-Yeah?
Yeah.
"You know, it's funny."
Looking at these old cases makes me wonder-- did we make a dimerence?
"I mean, çan we make a dimerence?"
Are we butte_ly wings?
Are we the wind?
It's like the horses.
"You try to figure out which one's the best fit for the track, runs harder, or prettier."
But when you admit that it's chaotic--
"Alvin, thank you."
We can talk after the meeting.
I can take it from here.
"Yeah, you'll, uh--"
"Give you, what, a half hour or so?"
Probably.
Right.
"Uh, I might be gone by then."
"But, uh, maybe not."
Let's just see.
Right.
Let's just see.
"Now, this essay about why I want to be Samantha's dad."
"Um, should I read it to you?"
[knock on door] I think I'm going to head out to the track.
- Mind telling Lulu for me?
- OK.
Thanks.
Can I read this to you?
"Uh, no, that's fine."
"There's this part in it about my sponsor, if you think that's OK."
Um...
Your sponsor?
"Yeah, how he said it's OK for me to be in a relationship-- have a relationship, you know?"
"Well, can we watch ""Lost Boys""?"
I've heard of that one.
Those... those are different lost boys.
"(whistling ""Snowbird"")"
"Are you whistling ""Snowbird""?"
Yeah.
That's awesome.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, why do you get to ring it?"
Because I was into her first.
"(doorbell rings) Let's flip for it, or..."
I can't believe you did that.
I cannot believe you just did that.
(doorbell rings) Will you stop it.
She's going to think we're weird.
Hi.
Can I help you?
Hi.
Miss Murray.
My name's Brian Griffin.
"Uh, first of all, I just want to tell you what a huge fan I am."
"Aw, that's very sweet of you."
And I'm Stewie.
I'm the one who sent you the vibrators.
"Well, I'm glad you enjoy my music."
Would you like to come in?
We'd love to.
"Wow, nothing says success like free on a Tuesday at 3:00 p.m."
I'll get there.
"So, Miss Murray, the reason we came is that we have a question about ""Snowbird."""
"It's about a relationship, right?"
"No, no, it's obviously about the fear of growing old."
"You know, I think you're both kind of right."
The wounded go before the dead.
We thought we'd better not move him.
They zapped me good.
You're not gone yet.
"Would you do me a favor, sir?"
Would you take a touch with me?
I sure will.
"Thank you, sir."
"Another favor, sir?"
What is it?
"You remember the decision I was trying to make, about my name?"
KIRBY:
The signs?
I remember.
That's it.
"There it is, sir."
You're sure that's what he wanted?
Affirmative.
That's what he wanted and that's what he's going to get!
Maybe he liked the idea of having so many men think about him every day.
Besides it sings.
It sings?
That's what he said.
It sings.
ROBIN:

It does sing!
"Last time we met, Colonel Cai and I were going to tell you about a plan we had and ""A"" camp 107 got hit."
This can't wait till you take over.
I want you briefed.
- Why way out here?
- This is top secret.
- You gotta go ?
See yourself home.
- Fuck you !
"- Bitch, I'm gonna--"
- What the hell is your problem ?
You gonna take that bitch's back and won't even cover mine ?

"Get outta my face, college boy, and take that trailer trash ho with you."

Come on now.
There we go.
It's okay. lt's okay.
- What's wrong with him ?
"- He don't know you, Kenny."
"I'm his father, he knows me."
What should I do ?
- Come around more often.
"- See, I can't talk to you."
And I can't depend on you.
- Shh.
- [ Baby Crying ]
"What do you think I use to raise this baby, oxygen ?"
"He has needs, Kenny, and his needs require money."
- Here we go.
- And we're gonna keep going... until I get what I need from you to raise your son.
I'm doing the best that Ican.
But do you think your mouth helps the situation ?
What's left of it.
This is the place that you're trying to save?
Mm-hmm.
It's so beautiful.
You think so?
Yeah.
Why would anybody want to ruin this?
Well...
Look...
A glossy ibis.
I watch a lot of documentaries on TV.
"You know, maybe I don't have to leave."
"I mean, it's so safe here and nobody knows about this place."
Except you and me.
Just you and me.
And the 20 of us.
What makes for good television?
"The story as it breaks, live, coming to you from the bad guy himself?"
"I mean, we wouldn't want your viewers to change the fucking channel, would we?"
What the hell's this world coming to?
- Nice.
- I'm sorry.
I'll buy you a new one.
Subject has just passed Flowerbowl.
I'm about 30 yards back.
- Stay with him.
I'm coming on your right.
- I can't see him.
Where is he?
- He's in front of the Pier One truck!
- All right.
We just passed the Flowerbowl.
Lots of cake.
We love cakes.
"I got the green one for you, that's your favourite, right?"
I'll have the marzipan cake.
"No, the Goosey Whipped Cream."
"- You're far out, Thomas."
- Sure I am.
I'm expected to be.
- Stop it.
- Bums like me are skinny.
"I'll get so fat, people won't see the bum."
They'll nod and say:
What a good citizen with a double chin and all.
- Why don't you eat your cake?
"- I want to stop, Thomas."
I can't take it anymore.
Really?
Then I'll have it.
I can go on all day.
I don't know why.
Stop it!
You know what I mean.
"I'm talking about us, not the cakes."
About us?
Our relationship and stuff?
"Crisis, intimacy, presence, closeness."
- I'm serious.
"- Listen, the two of us have a pact."
We love each other.
"Even when we're apart, we're together, anyway."
"It can't be any different, Tilde."
- It's an old pact.
Like being so co-dependent you flunk your test.
You are like a detective.
I'm close to identifying the bad guy.
You already know half my life story.
Some of your questions even my mom has never asked.
Are you saying I'm nosy?
No.
"Why would I say that, doc?"
"You should get more sleep, doc."
How do you know I didn't?
I am an expert on this.
"Just looking at your eyes, I can tell."
"Lately, I have exams."
I recommend Redbull mixed with coffee.
You can stay awake until dawn.
And that's good?
It's okay.
It's not like we're 20 anymore.
"Back then, staying up 2 nights was nothing."
"But in our 30's, our body starts breaking down."
How long can you stay awake?
5 days.
Like the X-men.
It's my special power.
But I'm okay.
I feel totally fine.
"I can do it, doc."
It's... necessary.
I think you should stop.
"This is my profession, how can I stop?"
"If you can't stop, can you do less?"
I can't.
[Sighs] He loves me.
Mmm.
He loves me not.
He loves me!
[laughs] I knew it!
"Ariel, stop talking crazy!"
I gotta see him again... tonight.
- Scuttle knows where he lives.
"- Ariel, please!"
Will you get your head out of the clouds and back in the water where it belongs?
"I'll swim to his castle, then Flounder will splash around to get his attention."
- And then we'll go...
- Down here is your home!
"Ariel, listen to me."

Cari just told Bob she's leaving for Brazil with Susan and Jamie.
I'll read it when the book comes out.
"Cari, don't tell me lies."
I don't wanna hear more lies.
Prove your love by staying with me.
But you know I love you.
I left George for you.
But not until I left Carla.
"Cari, sometimes I doubt your words, doubt our future."
Sometimes I'm sure we have nothing together.
"Bob, don't say that."
I can't bear it.
I won't hear it.
"Then prove your love, stay with me forever."
"I will, my dear, after we return."
"No, Cari, it's if you return."
You know me better than that.
You know I never lied to you.
"Haven't you, Cari?"
Haven't you really?
"Oh, Cari, I love you, I need you."
I want you here.
"So, you get along with your mom ?"
"You know, you all tight and shit ?"
Yeah.
"We got along, tight and shit."
-How come you never talk about her ?
-'Cause there's nothing to say.
It's because you don't talk about her.

"I don't know, just say something about her."
"I mean, you don't say anything about her."
"Well, she's dead."
"God, what do you want me to do,"
-run through the streets screaming ?
-lf it helps.
"Well, it won't, so drop it."

"You're really burning the midnight oil, huh?"
I got to.
I'm doing the work of two people until they can hire someone else.
"Speaking of which, guess who's on the search committee for the new principal?"
- Who?
- Timothy.
"That seems complicated, doesn't it?"
"Listen, I know that  we could use the money, but, um, do you really want to be principal?"
"It seems like it's a lot of work, and you are pregnant."
You know?
"Is it really the right time for this, right now?"
"No, you're right, it's a terrible time."
"But jobs like this don't come along very often, especially ones where I have the inside track."
"So yeah, I want it."
And I don't want Timothy to ruin it for me.
I got it.
- Hey.
"- Hey, come on in."
"- Hey, Mike."
- Hi.
What's up?
"Uh, just work stuff."
Can I talk to you for a sec?
"I've got some ""work stuff"" of my own to finish."
honesty is all we ask from those who work for us.
There is no honor in deceit.
Death doesn't frighten you?
"No, not if it is for the right reason."
"No, not if it is for the right reason."
My business requires a handy man.
Oh yeah?
What are you offering?
What you gave me.
A life.
Do I have to drink that shit?
When do I start?
There you go.
That is dino campanela.
The head of the campanela family.
We believe he was behind the attack.
Are you sure about that?
Are you sure about that?
I will be.
What do you want me to do?
You will find what you need under the seat.
"If there is trouble, use it."
There you are.
How are you doing shuji?
"Listen, I heard what happened."
I'm sorry.
If there is anything I can do.
Thank you.
I'm glad you can make this meeting.
"Like I said, anything I can do."
Let's sit.
I want to know why you have ignored our agreement.
A few.
Through my dad.
"Look, I spend half my life trying to get people like Cleaver Greene to pay their tax."
How do you think that makes me feel?
This is a chance for me to do some good.
So do it.
Knock 'em dead.
I have to go study.
TV:
"Then let it go, and crouch, and hold."
CLEAVER:
"Morning, folks."
Stretch out the whole body and...
Pica hardly sleeps here.
Just comes to paint and read.
I've no idea what he does with the rest of his time.
"I shouldn't let him stay, really, but he's quiet and he's a gentleman."
"There you go, my lad."
"Come on, boys, out of there."
Finnegan.
She is your teacher!
She's meant to be telling you about Jane Austen.
It is age inappropriate sex!
It's bloody great sex.
"At your age, you should be having exploratory sex with a girl your own age."
And maybe some oral.
"Oh, yuck."
"The damage you are doing to your psyche could be irreparable, darling."
I know.
I'm trained.
"Well, I'm not ending it."
It is immoral!
I missed it.
I left him with mama before he was two years old.
So that means I've missed four of his birthdays.
So we celebrated all four of them last night.
Does your mama know about...
Know what?
"No, I never told her."
"I never meant you any trouble, Dale."
I still don't.
"I bet Bonnie would be surprised if she knew she had a half-brother over in nigger town, though."
"You know, you really should have some of our baby's cake."
Quit calling him that.
Why?
That's what he is.
Here.
Goddamn it!
I told you I don't want any.
This what you want?
What are you doing?
"This is what you want, isn't it?"
"Come on, cut it out."
Cut it out.
Cut it out!
Goddamn it!
Why did you ever fuck with me?
"Me and my brother's daddy was white, did you know that?"
"Of course, we never knew him."
He had another family.
But that's why I kind of look white.
Because my daddy was white.
"And I guess you figured since I kind of look white, you can fuck me."
What the hell.
I just want to let you know that my confessional is open all week long.
"I'll be there if you need to speak about anything or talk, get things off your mind."
And I um...
I don't mean to have to do this.
It's kind of required.
This is a crisis prevention helpline if you need to talk to somebody about anything.
And this is a poison control.
Probably might need that.
I don't know.
The good news is we have singles night on Tuesdays down in the basement.
We like to dance around.
It's a lot of fun.
I married the church but I dance and look.
"And if anyone has lifestyle changes they might want to reconsider, they can just, oh, come to my office."
"Thank you, Father."
You're welcome.
Thank you.
That's not him.
He's gone.
Let's go see mommy and daddy.
Ok.
"Look, Katie."
It's a bride!
It's a bride!
Come on!
"I'm gonna be a bride one day, too."
This is what my dress is gonna look like.
Like it?
Yes.
Very pretty.
Thanks.
Today's my first communion.
I just had to have some of this chili.
You see?
It's pie.
"No, what Eric's saying is that we put signs up on our highway chatting up our soup and pie."
"You're a real smart young man, Eric."
You think so?
"Why, sure."
"Now, certainly a man of the world like yourself feels more at ease in the big city, but a guy like you could do pretty well in a town like ours."
You think so?
Maybe I will stay for a while.
Really?
"Yeah, you know, good woman, good friends, good pie."
I think I could be happy here for the rest of my life.
Eric.
"Let's see, do you really think you could be happy here?"
"I'm already happy here, Cor."
These people have taken me in.
They've made me feel important.
"Back home, I'm just a loser who didn't get into college, but here,"
I could be king.
"Well, congratulations."
I'll just tell Mom and Dad.
I know they'll be so proud.
I know I am.
I'm the prince of Sprinkle Land.
Hey.
Soup and pie for everybody.
The new guy's buying.
"Oh, man, this is good pie."
I was three hours from home.
Dad!
Cory!
Or Marie.
"Or me, if you like."
"You know, I don't know how to say this."
I...
"You know, the things I deal with you and me don't have much of a..."
"What you might call ""an experiential overlap."""
What if I told you we do?
I have spent my whole life scared.
"Frightened of things that could happen might happen, might not happen."
Fifty years I spent like that.
Finding myself awake at 3 in the morning.
But you know what?
Ever since my diagnosis I sleep just fine.
Okay.
And I came to realise it's that fear that's the worst of it.
That's the real enemy.
So...
Get up.
Get out in the real world.
And you kick that bastard as hard as you can right in the teeth.
Do it again.
Go on.
"Ten thousand even, same as last time."
It's totally accurate.
"You and I, we are gonna feed this machine."
- I want it running 24 hours a day.
- Right on.
"Not yours, I take it."
"We got 10, 20, 30 44, five each."
Three pounds should be 48 each.
Who's short?
All right.
No!
You gave me your word!
Come on!
There might be more of those bastards inside.
"No, you mustn't go out there."
They'll kill you.
Stay here!
They're going to kill you!
Leave her.
"She doesn't need a priest, she needs an executioner."
Or are you trying to tell me that you hope these bandits will go to heaven?
- Be careful.
- I will be.
Don't worry.
Come on.
Get them all out of there.
- I hoped they'd catch Carrasco too.
- We were told he wasn't among them.
Too bad.
"But if they've got any captives, we'll make them talk."
"We've got the whole gang, Coronel."
- Let me speak to your commander.
- Be quiet.
- You lied to me.
You gave me your word.
- What's all this shouting about?
They were in that hospital over there.
- There.
- Have they been identified?
- Some.
- The corpses must be burnt.
"- You're Padre Julio, aren't you?"
"It is true that I missed you all day long in that bed, it was endless."
"I tried to forget everything in sleeping, but I couldn't."
Do you know what I kept thinking about ?
about that day that we spent here together.
It was a great day !
Simon !
"Simon, are you alright ?"
"Yes, I'm ok !"
"Are you hungry, Babette ?"
I'm starving !
It's smells good !
What did you make?
It's pork with honney and curry.
That's the curry I can smell.
I've got a bottle of Bordeau.
That sounds great !
It will go well with the meat.
Remind me to buy you some place mats.
You haven't got much tableware.
"You know that Simon couldnt care less, and I hate shopping."
"Never mind, you're such a good cook."
I like it !
You'll have to give me the recipe.
What's wrong ?
I have something to tell you.
I have to leave again.
I am sailing back for work in a few days time.
Just like this.
Yes !
Five weeks.
We are sailing to south Africa.
It is the last time I am leaving for so long.
"oh, no, no, you don't."
"No, you have perfect grades."
You can skip one class.
Are you okay?
Your heart's beating like crazy.
Allison.
Do you know how they died?
Maybe.
If you tell me why you're so interested.
Um...
"It's him, isn't it?"
What?
Who?
Him who?
"The test didn't work, but it's still him."
It's Jackson.
What do you think you're doing?
The hour's up.
You're not leaving till every single one of these bubbles is filled in.
I thought you wanted to talk.
I...
I...
I Chang mmi.
You sure?
Because you look a little stressed.
Is it Scott?
Is it that whole thing?
I still can't believe you actually think your little Romeo and Juliet story's gonna last.
You know he's eventually just gonna run to Derek and join up with him and his little wolf pack.
"If you don't realize that, then you gotta be the stupidest bitch in this town."
"Well, other than Scott since he's a pretty stupid bitch himself."
Stop it.
646.
- And 5 more.
- Here is another 20.
Plus 3.
The change they gave me when I bought the fur coats.
And you said it wasn't a good idea to buy them.
- Mr. Dürchlich?
"- Well, yes."
"You use the pencil as a phone, but still, you don't have the money for the hotel."
What can I say?
Nice prospects.
"Well, we'll surely cover the rest somehow."
How much are you still missing?
- 54.
- That's nothing.
That's right!
-You've got to do it someday.
"-Yeah, but how?"
I have a selfish idea.
It has to do with you and me.
It's called marriage.
-Wouldn't that just bowl him over?
-I'm sure it would.
And me too.
But... don't think of doing it just to bowl him over.
"Betty, you're the only girl I've ever wanted."
Rodney...
"Rodney, not that way..."
What good is life if I go through it not having guts to do it my way?
Rodney... I've really loved you for such a long time.
It must take a lot of patience to make something so beautiful.
That's what they tell me.
- This is tearing him apart.
Martha...
Gaad is not your friend.
"Oh, come on, guys."
Martha's ugly.
I'd have to be 10 scotches deep before I touch her.
Ew. 10 scotches and a bag over her head.
Bastards.
I know.
I know.
Do they always talk about me that way?
"Oh, my God."
I shouldn't have played it.
"No, it's-it's better that I know..."
who they really are.
"Martha, I-I've never been any good at seduction or romance."
But I love the way you look.
I love every part of you.
"And if I could, I would go in there, and I would..."
"I know you would, Clark."
But I have a job.
A very important job.
And things are a lot worse than you know.
What?
Uh... have you ever heard of Stealth?
No.
"It's a huge, complex military project."
"I don't understand it all, but there are a lot of leaks coming out -- we think -- of your office."
We've found it very difficult to find a source.
What do you need?
I so appreciate that.
I really do.
Wait a minute.
"Monica, how did you do this?"
"Well, when we were on our way home from rehab,"
"Dad had told me what had happened,"
So i just wanted to make up
"For all the bad things i've done,"
So i called papa joe's
And i made arrangements with my debit card to have your stuff back.
Regina: oh my god.
"Regina: wait wait, but..."
But how did...
How did you do it?
I don't understand.
"Well, mom, dad,"
I've been painting again since i've been in rehab.
And the director saw my stuff
And he thought i should have an art show
And i did and i sold all my artwork
And i made enough money to get mom's stuff back.
- What?
- Yeah.
"Oh, baby, i'm so proud of you."
"I am so proud of you, monica."
I've missed you so much.
I've missed all those things about you
That make you so special.
And i'm gonna be a good mother to you...
I promise you that...
If you'll just let me.
I told you i was gonna make you proud of me one day.
and you have.
- I hope i did.
"- Okay, 1...3...5..."
- Okay.
- Got it?
- Yeah I'm good.
"Oh, stop moving the pier."
Nice knowing you.
You've got Mason Bowl next week and this is how you're training?
- Can we do this later?
- There may not be a later for you.
"- Oh, oh Mr. Scott..."
- Was I talking to you?
Get in the car.
I'm driving you both home.
You're mother's going to love this.
You getting drunk on her watch...
There's some kind of interesting news that I need to talk to you about.
Why does interesting scare me?
"No, no."
"Listen, the company's been hired to do some flood control."
They want me to supervise.
How long is it going to be this time?
"Well, seeing that it is in New Zealand, um, 3 maybe 4 months."
"So, what's the upside?"
"It's a lot of money, sweetie."
Way more than I make now.
We could be good to go for a while.
Maybe even afford that art school you talk about.
Is this something that you want?
I only want to do this if it's right for us.
"You should do it, dad."
What happened to you?
Nice to see you too.
Because I liked you.
Do you think I'm still attractive for women?
"To me, yes."
Of course you are.
You knew who I was.
I've heard about you.
Great piece for your collection.
I don't know if you're mean or just pathetic!
"That night, the only thing that had your interest was the name."
Be honest.
But what does the first night matter?
There have been other nights I think.
I just wanted to be sure.
Are you calm now?
Yes.
Then I'm leaving.
Nobody stops here.
I have an idea.
Maybe if I wait here alone somebody stops.
Why don't you hide behind there?
-I won't.
It's easier for a lonely girl.
Don't be ridiculous!
You're not going to stay here alone.
-But you're gonna be right there!
No way.
"Please, let me do it."
Don't think that I like picking up people in the road.
Did you have breakdown?
No.
We don't have a car.
We're spending the weekend in the countryside.
"Is he a dentist, then?"
"Well, he's a dentish."
He's got a hammer.
Davus?
Yeah?
Smash out Grumio's bad tooth.
"Of course, boss."
Just give it a wipe.
Very good.
Very medical.
"All right, fella."
Just lean back for me there.
Do you not want to know which tooth it is first?
"Yeah, go on, then, mate."
It's that wonky one there.
I'll sort of aim in that ballpark.
Stay still for me.
"I-I might leave it, actually."
"Yeah, probably for the best."
"No, I don't like it!"
"Everyone's loving it under the new boss, man."
I've heard several people call you 'nice' and one woman even say 'fairly hot'.
"Well, if you listen to what people need, they will thank you for it."
"Thanks for letting me get my new partner, by the way, Big Paulus."
"Good, isn't he?"
"Well, he's tall, yeah."
Which is what it's all about now we've raised the jug and swapped the papyrus for apples.
"Bitey-bitey, eyes shut tighty!"
"Oh, my Jove!"
Where did you get him from?
I just saw him guarding the grain store.
"I was, like, 'Big boy, you're coming with me!"
Bye-bye.
And we're out.
"Eddie, you did it again."
Please don't cue the music until I'm waving goodbye.
Sorry.
It's not rocket science.
"Stan, there you are."
Did you get my email?
About?
My new idea.
About all the fan letters I've been getting.
I thought I could read a few of them on the air.
"Well, I don't really think we have time."
"Oh, sure, we have time."
I'll just pick the lotto numbers faster.
"Well, you see, Natalie, the show is about the numbers."
That's why people are watching.
It's not really about you.
Really?
Is that what you're hearing?
Because that's not what I'm hearing.
Why don't we discuss this later?
I'll see you Monday.
Okay.
Jesus.
Excuse me.
Do these cables have to be right here?
"Yes, they do."
Because they carry your voice from this microphone to that sound board.
"Well, can't you put them someplace else?"
I almost broke my neck.
Almost doesn't count.
!
"Health and Safety, rummaging through me stock!"
"All right, they found a little few things."
Couple of mice.
"So what's, what's the...?"
Few rat droppings in the lemon bonbons.
Couple of fruit salads was way past their sell-by date.
Three years.
"That's not a crime, though, is it?"
"Well, enough to get you shut down."
Is it enough for you to kidnap him?
That's what I want to know.
I'll tell you what I know - he don't know nothing about sweets.
And I've got sweets running through my veins!
I know that.
Look at me!
I know that.
"I'm on my own, I've got nothing!"
Open up.
"There you go, it's all right."
It's all right.
"Plenty of other, there's plenty of other sweet shops out there."
Could I have a bit of the strawberry laces?
There you go.
"I had everything, now I've got nothing!"
"There you go, eh?"
Time was of the essence.
We headed to the station.
For clues?
No.
For something a little more important than that.
"Come on, O'Leary, follow me."
- Not one stinking customer.
"We had some really great times living at the old Newman Home, until we got pro contracts and our mom made us move back in with her."
Here's the thing.
"We've got a plan to save our home, but we need a sponsor."
And who better than three glorious hockey heroes from Charlestown's past?
- Good idea.
- Smart kid.
Who were you thinking of?
You guys.
- You'd sponsor us?
- I don't know.
Hockey's pretty violent.
We gave that up with the bar fights and the gambling.
Not our path.
"Look, it'd be great advertising."
"We'll be travelling all over the state, playing a new style of hockey."
Just think.
Zenovation on ice.
"Come on get it, boys."
Here you are.
Look at the pads!
- Here we go.
- All right.
You get one of these.
"There you go, guys."
There you go.
Goalie!
Goalie!
Good save.
Nice catch.
"Hey, my name isn't goalie, you know."
It's Henri.
Pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease...
Stop.
Just go.
Pleeeeease can we slow down?
Ow!
You're chafing my wrist.
Don't pretend you're not loving this.
Okay.
All right.
I think I just skated through some pee.
C-can we go back now?
- No!
- God.
"No, because we are not appointment-making control freaks."
We are having fun.
You are.
I'm just doing what you're making me do.
"Okay, okay, stop."
"No, no, no."
"No, no, no."
"Let's go back, let's go back, let's go back."
Why?
Why do we have to go back now?
"Why... oh, I get it."
I get it.
You're still scared to skate through the underpass.
"What do you mean, ""still""?"
"What do you mean, ""scared""?"
What underpass?
"Mitchell, you were 11 years old, and mom made me take you with me when I was skating with my friend Sophie King, and you were terrified to go through the underpass 'cause it was dark, and you were sure it was filled with monsters,"
so we ditched you.
I don't remember this at all.
We have to talk.
I know Migs is with you.
He voluntarily came back to me.
"Bela, the only person who lost a memory is Migs."
Not you.
"Don't take advantage of him,"
Give him back to me.
"If you're thinking that I'm a mistress now,"
"If you're thinking that I'm a mistress now, you got it wrong."
You're probably forgetting...
I'm the first love...
He's happy with me.
"If he ever forgot you, it's not my fault."
Maybe that was destined to happen.
I'm begging you.
You already have everything.
Give him back to me.
You're wrong.
I waited for so long to be with him.
I can't give him back to you.
It's Migs' medicines.
I know you don't want me for Migs.
It's not that I don't like you for my brother.
I just really got used to him and Bela.
Just tell Mommy and Daddy that Migs and I need some space.
I'm begging you.
Take good care of Migs.
Your patient has fallen asleep from waiting for you!
I think she wants you to tell stories.
"Joy, April and I will just do the rounds."
-We'll go ahead!
-Bye!
Cut the crap.
"Hey, watch what you say."
I wish we can sleep like this till dawn.
Is it okay?
What about your friend?
She and I do some things for each other.
"I listen to all her stories, so this is fine."
I'm probably the only friend who listens to her secrets.
So what's it like working as a manager of a cafe?
Do you make a lot of money?
Not really.
"But I don't waste money, so I can manage."
I hope the divorce goes well with your husband in Seoul.
It will.
Will you come by around lunch?
"My friend likes you too, though she doesn't show it."
I'll cook you hot chicken stew like you wished for.
"- It would be perfect with Soju, huh?"
- Yes.
Feels so good.
Can I feel this good?
Open the door!
Open the door!
Right now!
Hurry and open it!
- She's a friend of mine.
- She's too emotional.
Just stay quiet for a bit.
Open the door!
Open it!
Hey!
I'm telling you to open up!
I'm going to be tougher with him.
I promise.
Huh.
It's weird.
I just have this vague feeling of you actually being a good mother.
I hate you!
"I hate you, I hate you!"
I hate you!
"Reese, this is crazy."
You've been staring at that damn thing for four days.
We're getting rid of it.
No!
Wait!
I finally have an idea.
What is it?
I'll have it in a second!
Just wait!
"It's over, Reese."
"Once the board's gone, things should go back to normal."
Did you know that the Newmans put a statue of a naked guy on their front lawn a week ago?
We should be ashamed of ourselves.
No!
We are not getting rid of this!
"Reese, what is the big deal?"
What is so special about this board?
I think it's my last time.
Last time for what?
For anything stupid and reckless and fun.
"Maybe it's because I'm almost 18 now, but lately I've been hearing this voice in my head that says,"
"""That's dangerous, that's stupid."
"You're gonna hurt yourself."""
"And the old voice, the one that says,"
I know how much that stuff meant to her.
How is she doing?
"Come on, monica."
You know your mother.
I mean not good at all.
I don't even know what to say to her.
"I've been helping her with the house while taking care of my bills,"
But there's only so much i can do.
I mean she was making more than me.
i really hate to see her like this.
"Know what, dad?"
I forgot...
I need to go make a phone call.
Can you watch my bag?
"- Baby, just use my phone."
- There's probably no service.
"Sure enough, she's right."
Hmm.
Hoo.
"How was your run, regina?"
"It was good, mother."
"Well, any other time it'd be ""mama."""
"You still mad, but that's okay."
- You'll get over it.
"- Mama, i really don't wanna go through this again."
"You know, your nagging is getting real old."
"Now before you go storming off to your room like usual,"
Do you mind getting the door this time?
It's your shift.
I've already done mine.
oh god.
I don't know why you're making me come over here and do this.
School was never easy for Dirk.
"We didn't have much money, and... well, you know, kids -- They can be cruel."
They picked on him.
They picked on him?
They called him poor and dirty and stupid.
They even had a nickname for him.
Dirk the jerk.
"And after what happened to his mother, he..."
His mother?
"Yeah, Jane, my wife."
She died when Dirk was 13.
Cancer.
"I was working three jobs, so it fell to Dirk to take care of her."
And he was a great kid.
He made sure Jane got her medicine.
"He helped her, cleaned up after her."
"But, you know, you -- you watch somebody die slow, waste away to nothing... it does things to a person."
Horrible things.
I didn't know about his mother.
He... he wouldn't talk about her.
Not even to me.
Lot of anger in that boy.
I'm sorry.
"Well, we'd really like to pay our respects, Mr. McGregor."
"Um, you mind telling us where Dirk is buried?"
"Oh, he wasn't."
I had him cremated.
All of him?
"Well, I kept a lock of his hair."
"Oh, that's..."
That's nice.
Where do you keep that?
We shall fight them in the Kardomah.
We shall never surrender.
"Sorry, that was a terrible Diana Dors impression!"
On the house.
"Anne, you're a bobby-dazzler."
I know I am.
Help yourself.
"No, I'm full."
"Anyway, I'm on a diet, supposedly."
"I'm doing it with Pauline, the girl I work with."
She wants to lose three stone and take all her hems up.
She's got chunky knees.
"Yours aren't chunky, if I may say."
"No, but office solidarity."
You were very... manly in there when you took charge.
"No, I surprised myself."
Don't know what's going on with me at the moment.
It's all happening!
Didn't I hear you say your mother had just died?
"Yes, she did."
And did you live with her?
Yes.
House to myself now.
So thank God for this place!
She didn't like music.
She struggled.
She found life a bit of an obstacle course.
"Well, it is."
"Actually, do you mind if I...?"
"No, please."
I may have over-vinegared.
Not for me.
You!
"Up, up, up!"
Questa mano!
Questa mano!
What the hell have we here?
-I'll see my sister alone.
-It concerns me too.
May I stay?
"How are you, honey?"
"You've met Merle, he was with me in Vegas."
-I saw him with you.
-Could I have a drink?
"Al, please get him a drink!"
We're going to Europe.
I'd like to book passage on The Queen.
Why don't you go to a travel agent?
We're getting married first.
"The ink on your divorce isn't dry yet, and you're getting married?"
You see your children on weekends.
Your oldest boy was picked up in Reno for a theft you don't even know about.
You fly around the world with men who use you!
-You're not my father!
-So why come to me?
I need money.
"Connie, Connie, Connie..."
I want to be reasonable with you.
Why don't you stay with the family?
You can live on the estate with your kids.
You won't be deprived of anything.
I don't know this Merle.
I don't know what he does or what he lives on.
Tell him marriage is out of the question and you don't want to see him anymore.
"I should have seen coming, and I didn't."
Do you want to talk about it?
"No, I don't."
I'll...
I'll be fine.
"Well, I just got some news that we should have seen coming but didn't, and it's not good."
What is it?
We've just been subpoenaed to testify against Louis.
♪♪
What's that?
Moo shu pork and fried rice.
"The way I treated you before,"
I wasn't sure if you'd eaten yet.
- Harvey...
- And I was thinking that maybe we could eat while I tell you that I'm sorry and that I told Donna.
- You told her?
- Yes.
You were right.
"I needed to tell her, and it was unfair to her, and it was unfair to you."
- I never said that.
"- No, but you meant it."
"Harvey, if you're not careful, you're gonna become a full-fledged outstanding boyfriend."
Boyfriend?
Boyfriend.
Then I'll try not to be careful.
Come in.
"By the way, how did she take it?"
She was fine.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
Turned out she already knew.
"Well, I'm glad you told her."
"Well, your instincts are admirable, but you don't have to put aside your feelings for the sake of any of us."
I'm not saying I want to be the woman's best friend.
I'm just saying...
"I have been so busy blaming her,"
I don't think I've ever really seen her for who she is.
OK.
"So, what are you proposing?"
The truth of the matter is Holly is a part of our family now.
"I think I should embrace that, if only to set an example."
"I mean, we all have to put the past behind us where it belongs and move on."
- You think I'm crazy?
"- No, Nora."
I don't think you're crazy.
Good.
"Because if there's one person I count on to be my reality check, it's you."
Saul?
What?
It's the past.
It's not behind us.
You have to tell me what.
Tell me.
William and Holly had a daughter.
- What?
- Her name is Rebecca.
She's 20 years old.
She's here in L.A.
"I'm so sorry, Nora."
I'm so sorry.
- No one wanted to upset you.
- No one?
Who else knows?
Who else knows?
Have you any idea why a raven is like a writing desk?
Let me think about it.
"You know what tomorrow is, don't you?"
Frabjous Day.
How could I forget?
Wish I'd wake up.
"-Still believe this is a dream, do you?"
-Of course.
This has all come from my own mind.
Which would mean that I'm not real.
Afraid so.
You're just a figment of my imagination.
I would dream up someone who's half-mad.
"Yes, yes."
But you would have to be half-mad to dream me up.
(LAUGHS)
"I must be, then."
I'll miss you when I wake up.
(PLAYING TRUMPET)
Who will step forth to be champion for the White Queen?
That would be I.
You have very poor evaporating skills.
I should be the one.
I'll do it.
"-No, me."
"-No, me."
"No other slayer, nohow."
"If it ain't Alice, it ain't dead."
"Alice, you cannot live your life to please others."
"The choice must be yours, because when you step out to face that creature,"
you will step out alone.
Nothing was ever accomplished with tears.
What's in a name?
"One must serve tea, after all!"
Don't lie!
Shut up!
It's because of you that he got into trouble.
Where'd he get the 5000 Rupees he paid your surety from?
Speak the truth!
Where did the 5000 Rupees come from?
I wish I had.
They caught me putting back the money!
You should've told them that you're putting the money back!
They didn't let me speak!
They chased me and I ran!
But this job is not for you!
"Ajob is a job, after all!"
I only have to earn my living.
Yes.
I miss the respect I got as a chef.
Forget it!
I was sick of the hotel-life anyway.
I'm thinking of joining the movies now.
"Get me a role, will you?"
"If I become a star, I will soon join politics."
I could even become a minister soon after.
"You want to act, don't you?"
Of course!
"""Killing two birds with one stone"""
Wonderful!
That's a great title for a film!
"I play the stone, all right."
Who are the birds?
You will play both the roles.
Don't overstep.
"Rebecca,there he is."
Walk me to him.
"- Doc,stay here.Call Tanner."
- You got it.
Don't come any closer.
"Hauser,just hang on.We're gonna get you off that thing."
"No,you're not."
Let me help you.You need anything?
- Water?
- A cigarette.
You don't smoke.
I should never have quit.
- You don't need to be here.
"- Oh,I know.Just can't see from up there."
"So what I told you on the phone,that help you catch him?"
Windward elementary.
- So I was right.
- Yes.
And just this once I will apologize for doubting you.
Not just 'cause you're standing on a bomb.
About another minute down here.
Found the lyrics to that song.
"Last 1960s bomb,""Twin Tree"" clue,you ever find the place?"
No.
Have you been looking for it this whole time?
I made a promise to a friend.
Gotta go grab something from my pack.
I'Il be right back.
Madsen.
"When he tells you the bad news,just give it to me straight."
He modified it.I'm gonna have to improvise.
Not quite sure I get your meaning.
It's obvious she won't sleep with you.
It's written all over your puppy-dog face.
"- It's killing me, literally."
I'm dying.
"- Here, have a cookie."
"No, I'm cool."
I don't know what she's doing.
I cannot read her signals.
We used to sleep together all the time.
That's not true.
I don't know why I said that.
"It wasn't all the time, but it happened."
I know I'm not just making this up.
And then out of nowhere it just stops.
But she still calls.
She wants a massage.
She leaves cute messages.
But it's not going anywhere.
What is she doing?
"Honestly, we may not have the best insight."
Gay signals have nothing to do with straight signals.
He's right.
The signals are totally different.
"Like, here."
"Here's ""I wanna sleep with you."""
"One, two, three."
"That's it, three seconds or more, it's on."
"And here's ""I don't wanna sleep with you."""
"One, two..."
"- Nope, thanks for playing, move along."
- It's that simple.
Poor guy.
Anybody told Meuller?
No.
None of the guys wanted to break it to him.
Wait till he hears it.
"Yeah, I wouldn't wanna be Pete."
"For the last time, are you coming in with us or not?"
"I told ya no, and I mean no."
"Oh, you're stir-nuts."
He don't know what he's saying.
"Aw, come on, Frank, get wise to yourself."
"Lay off, Red."
Will you lay off?
Stacey's on the outside.
I'm sure he's working for me.
I'll take my chance that way.
"Tough luck, kid."
[MACHINERY RATTLING]
Jiggers.
"Meuller, you can't beat this joint!"
You have no chance!
Let me go!
"Meuller, why ain't you at work?"
Get back to your machine.
[SPITS]
Get over agin that wall.
I'm gonna bury you in the Hole.
You hear what I told ya?
Get over agin that wall.
So you're the guy that wouldn't let Lassiter go to the hospital?
"I'll put you where he is, if you don't keep away from me."
And you're the guy that made him fall and busted his back!
- Attaboy.
- When we got married... it was supposed to be for better or worse.
"Only I gave the better, and you gave the worse."
What are you gonna do about it?
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do about it.
Laverne!
I'm washing my hands of both of you!
You're rotten to the core!
You deserve each other!
"Sign it ""John Hancock."" It's my Declaration of Independence."
Okay!
That's wonderful.
At last you're a free man.
- You got your whole life ahead of you.
- I'm a free man!
- Right.
- I'm also an idiot.
- What do you mean?
"- There's just one hitch, and it lasts six years."
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?
I went to the colonel and had him swear me in.
"You mean, after all he said..."
Colonel Potter swore you in anyway?
"Yeah, yeah."
He even welcomed me aboard.
"Oh, I'm so stupid!"
What have I done?
Don't worry about it.
You're gonna be all right.
You just relax and let hotter heads prevail.
I don't believe this.
- Ha-ha-ha.
"- Come on, Slug, let's get our dough back."
"I'm sorry, but you can't take the dog inside."
- Fido wouldn't make a bit of trouble.
"- Sorry, but it's against the rules."
I'll have you understand I'm not a madam.
"Well, I wouldn't know about that."
I'm sorry.
- Take your hands off me.
- What's the trouble here?
- The lady has a dog.
- You needn't have been so rude about it.
"Poor Fido, did he hurt-um?"
- May I take your dog?
- No.
I'll give him back to you after the performance.
You're sure you'll take good care of him?
- Certainly.
- Thanks.
That's the second complaint I've had in five minutes.
- I must be slowing up.
- I think we can get along without you.
"- Aw, you hurt me."
- Turn in your uniform.
"Listen, Fido, this guy's got a wooden leg."
Try it sometime.
I dub you lieutenant.
[CHATTERING]
Uh-huh.
Did it again.
That's four pairs in a row.
"If this keeps up, I'm gonna buy you a fur coat."
- That guy is such an asshole.
- Don't blame it on him.
You're not makin' any progress.
I'm goin' to get the jump rope.
- Men are such pricks.
"- Oh, tell me about it."
I bet you're real tired of them pushing you around.
"Oh, God, you have no idea."
If only there was a way that you could be... physically tough enough to intimidate men.
I'm sorry.
Do I know you?
Let's just say I provide a much-needed service around this place.
"Step into the shadows and, uh, we'll talk."
Yeah?
"Mac and Dennis, dude."
Open the door.
- What?
- It's Mac and Dennis.
Open the door.
"Open the door, bro."
"All right, guys."
Hang on a second.
"It's like, uh..."
It's like 11:00 in the morning here.
- We don't care.
Open the door.
"- Surprise, bitch."
You're hittin' me with that?
"Charlie, let's be honest."
Punching boards isn't your thing.
- But that's okay.
"- Yes, that's okay, because for you... it's not gonna be about inflicting punishment... it's gonna be about having punishment inflicted upon you."
"Gentlemen, what do you think of your freedom now?"
"All right, my friend, if we've got to die, you've got to die, too."
"As long as I'm alive, you live."
- What did he say?
- He says he'll be unharmed.
"He says to keep order, be confident, and wait."
"Congratulations, Sergeant... on your knowledge of our humble language."
That's enough.
Get under the shade... before you get sunstroke.
Go on.
Get on back.
"Wounds feel satisfactory, sahib?"
I ain't had a more satisfactory set of welts since I ran away from home.
- Thank you.
- Fall in.
Come on.
- Get down.
Look out.
- Watch your head.
- The gold!
"- Yes, sahib, gold!"
"Look at it, mates!"
Gold!
That's what it is!
- Real solid sunshine!
"- Sit down, you fool!"
See that hand sticking out?
"I bet that little hand's worth £3,000 if it's worth a farthing!"
Who's a blinking idiot now?
"We're rich, mates."
Come on!
"All right, Mr. Wise Man, here's my last offer."
"Kim Seon Joo, did I order the curry?"
I don't think I heard.
I clearly heard you order the curry.
Me too.
Weird...
"Maybe you were thinking of pork cutlet in your head when you ordered the curry, you may have accidentally said curry instead of pork cutlet."
"No, I didn't."
"Team Manager, you can switch with me."
It doesn't matter to me.
I like curry too.
It's fine.
I'm sorry.
"She said she was buying, and she's just leaving."
I'll pay.
I'll pay.
But why is she getting so angry?
"She's not the type to get so worked up, it's weird."
What's there to get angry about?
I was mistaken.
Tell them to enjoy and that I'm sorry.
"It's okay, things like that can happen."
Enjoy.
How can I help you?
Excuse me.
We can make it for you as well.
Turkey sandwich and a coffee.
All right.
Stay seated!
Stay right there.
"I can take this off, right Doctor Kang?"
"Yes, please."
Now you're finally worth looking at.
I'm here.
My scouts just informed me.
I am sorry about your father.
"Jake, you're outmanned and you're outgunned."
There's too many of us and we are too desperate to give up.
You cannot win this.
I'm giving you one last chance.
"Walk away, put your guns down and return to town, and no one else will be harmed."
"Jake, I need an answer."
What's it gonna be?
Nuts.
"Sorry, I didn't get that."
You can go straight to hell.
About my father... you're the one I'm coming for.
I want to go home.
Our orders are to take people out of the conflict zone.
You'll be safer in Cheyenne.
Colonel Hoffman?
What is all this?
"Sir, wheels up in five minutes."
Roger that.
Jericho's been moved up to priority #1 on the list.
Thank you.
"Oh, God, thank you."
This is all thanks to you.
Don't worry.
We're gonna get things back to normal again.
"All right, saddle up."
My father expected us to make a stand here.
To defend our home.
That's what we're gonna do.
Smoke bombs!
Don't come any closer.
"Hauser, just hang on."
We're gonna get you off that thing.
"No, you're not."
Let me help you.
You need anything?
- Water?
- A cigarette.
You don't smoke.
I should never have quit.
- You don't need to be here.
"- Oh, I know."
Just can't see from up there.
"So what I told you on the phone, that help you catch him?"
Windward Elementary.
So I was right.
Yes.
And just this once I will apologize for doubting you.
Not just 'cause you're standing on a bomb.

I'll be right back.
Madsen.
"When he tells you the bad news, just give it to me straight."
He modified it.
I'm gonna have to improvise.
Modified it how?
I just run into things.
You don't really feel them till you get offstage.
Hey... can you put that on pause?
Yes?
No?
Yeah!
Of course.
"First, it sounds loud but then after a half hour it's not so loud, you know?"
"And after, like, three quarter of an hour, it's not loud enough, you know?"
"I think the lyrics to some of that stuff that ""Are you with..."""
It was so smart... so fucking smart...
It's nice just rocking.
But it's rock and smart.
That's to me like at the...
"Great time...man, that's just so good to see someone doing that."
"If that's not what it is all about, I don't know what it is."
Hello.
I know in speaking English but I like the group.
"Thank you the pictures, thank you everyday."
"If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again."
Head's up!
Dave!
Dave!
Dave!
Yeah!
"1, 2, 3..."
Nail it!
The chair!
What do you guys shooting at?
"Exit sign, why?"
"Come on, Buzz..."
"Dude, please, just one..."
You'll get hurt.
"Tell that to the governor, will you?"
"Hey, give me that."
"Never mind, Ponch."
"Excuse me, ma'am."
"Will be with you in a minute, okay?"
You can't write her a citation.
I can write her three citations for what she did.
You can't write her.
She's angry.
She's angry at us.
She's angry at the itsy-bit...
The signs.
She's angry with the state.
"She won't sign the ticket, she just..."
She won't accept it.
"Hey, the kid, huh?"
I can tell.
Okay?
- I'll hook her up and take her down.
- Take her down.
What you gonna do?
Tow her in?
That's gonna do a lot to beef up your arrest record.
"Excuse me, ma'am."
"Until we have time to do something about those signs maybe you can be a little more careful, okay?"
"Now, if you could just slide over."
"Nice Officer Poncherello will help you turn around, okay?"
You be careful now.
We don't want to get hurt.
She gave me a cookie.
But it's for you.
So you admit it's me.
Just tell me what you have.
The dead whiz kids... they all had one more thing in common other than their talents.
Otto.
He found a pattern.
They all applied to Seattle State University.
Kevin Whitfield apply?
Just like all the others.
You gonna talk to their admissions officer?
- Yeah.
I am.
- Good.
Take me with you.
The only other person that knows as much about this case as you is me.
"You came to me once, for help."
"I saw where it was going, I told you to drop it."
"And you did, and I just..."
Watched that eat away at you.
I was there.
I know it's you.
But if I say it out loud it means I'm either crazy or it's true.
You just said it out loud.
[Sighs shakil]
"Gracie and Helen, you don't tell them."
I do when it's time.
"Let's solve this case, Duval."
"When we get there, I do the questioning."
You don't talk.
They were so rare.
Each of them.
I remember some of their essays.
Who could want to take these lives?
"Never mind that, doctor."
Is the master okay now?
He's absolutely fine.
Aunty!
How will I...
Why are you making her cry?
Leave her alone.
"Ask the doctor when we can take the boss home, dear."
Today itself.
"And Dr. Rohit is around for help, too."
"Let's go home, uncle."
Get well soon.
We've got a lot to decide.
"No, Rohit."
"You're a good doctor, I know."
But let's leave it at that.
"What do you say, Laxmi?"
"Place some money in aunt's plate, grandpa."
"Why do I need to do that, dear?"
After all that she has done for us we ought to give her the keys of the family.
"Use keys on locks, sir."
Place some change in it now.
Treat that like a golden biscuit!
"Come on, sir..."
I'll take that.
"Coming, sir."
Did you call me?
"I've been alone for 20 years, after Lajwanti's death."
I have never missed female company in all these years.
"You have served me so well now, Lakshi!"
I don't think a wife would have taken so much of care!
See that?
"She's a fraud, Brian."
A fraud!
She didn't write any of her songs.
"Well, so, that's the case with a lot of singers."
It's a very common industry practice.
"Well, then you're all a bunch of frauds, aren't you?"
A bunch of frauds and charlatans.

"I think that before we get there, the victim will be up and gone."

They're painkillers.

Yes.

"Oh, excuse me a second."
Speak louder. it's windy.
I can't hear you.
I can't hear you.
How do you know?
"I said, how do you know?"
I can't hear.
Speak louder.
We were cut off.
"You were saying, doctor..."
What's wrong with her?
"Nothing, she's just old and weak."
She's just a bag of bones and she's not very well at all.
Old age is a terrible illness.
"Yes, but there are worse illnesses."
Death...
- Death?
Why?
- No.

But I have this one buyer and I wanted to make sure his girlfriend likes it first.

But you should have just obiæi neighborhood and find out how much it is.
"I'm sorry it was, but I thought that crime police shoot so bad."
"Squat is closed, all in all good."
It is celebrated?
"Nothing, drink appetizer."
I'll tell you what we are celebrating.
Here I am in the lab.
They found 2 samples DNA on the bag and Cetin head.
When will the results?
Tomorrow.
I told you if you trust in me.
They made themselves a place where the shit couldn't touch 'em.
"Every precinct has its ""cop bar, """
"a private club, all blue."
"For the 3-7, it was the 4 Aces... just across the river."

"This Armenian guy, he's from the other side over there."
He tells her that she's dead.
Right?
She's gonna be dead by morning.
"- So he drops this box off at her place, right?"
- They call you guys.
- They call Bomb Squad.
- Right.
We go in there.
We x-ray it on scene.
"- And, uh, we can't see anything in there."
- [ Man ] Right.
I cut a little hole in it.
I can see there's something in there.
[ Man ] Uh-huh.
"I, uh, I see that there's, uh, some white fuzz."
There's something pink.
I can't figure out what it is.
- Suddenly I realize I am looking at a tongue.
"- Ah, shit!"
"A big, fat tongue sticking out at me."
Yes.
The guy put a goat's head in there.
[ Man ] This at the end of the twentieth century.
"H.G. Wells, he'd turn over in his grave to think at the start of a new millennium..."
"I have something to show you,"
"I just don't know if you'll be able to handle it, that's all."
I'm fed up with your mysteries.
I'm tired.
"Nathan, it'll take five minutes of your time, no more."
And then I'm out of here.
You'll never see me again.
I give you my word.
- You give me your word?
- Yes.
I give you my word.
"You know who I am, you know where I work, you're a lawyer."
"If I do anything wrong, anything at all which..."
It wouldn't take you five minutes to blow my career out of the water.
"Nathan, believe me, it's important."
You have to see it.
I swear.
It's important.
Come with me.
Five minutes.
10 minutes... no more.
And then...
I'm gone.
You brought me here just to tell me this?
What the hell does it mean?
Or is that all part of the message?
You come out with these little riddles of yours and expect me to...
"You see that guy, the kid in the orange jacket?"
Do you see him?
"Yeah, I see him."
So what?
Name of Dennis.
"If you say you're not the devil, and reveal your true form to me-"
I'll leave you alone.
"When the demon is snared, the rooster will cry three times."
Wait until the third cry.
You'll leave me alone?
Yes.
Two more.
Do not waver.
You'll leave?
Yes.
I'll leave you alone.
Who said I'd let you leave?
Then let me ask you one thing.
What?
Why in God's name is he doing this?
Because her father has sinned.
What sin?
What sin did I commit?
Her father suspected another.
"He tried to kill him, and finally succeeded."
But my daughter...!
My daughter...
My daughter got sick first!
How can that...
How can that possibly...
"One more, now."
How can that be...?
Don't do it.
What are you saying?
Whether you walk out of here or not is completely up to you.
Touch me and see.
"A ghost does not have flesh and bones, and you see I have both."
- We've got the guy who killed him.
- A cop killed my father!
- Kesser doesn't have the brains.
- He was convicted in court...
- Answer me!
- I'm telling you!
Your father is dead and this case is closed!
"If you can't accept that, that's your problem."
I can take that gun and that badge away from you right now.
- Is that what you want?
"- Do what you got to do, Nick."
"Hardy, we're out of our patrol zone."
Will you tell me where we're going?
We're going to visit a friend.
I'll break here for dinner.
I'll be back.
Right...
I'll just stay here and watch the boat.
- Can I get you something?
"- Yeah, a guy named Chicanis."
I don't think I've seen him all night.
"Okay, tell me what you know!"
Who told you to lie?
- Give me the names.
- Don't shoot me.
"- Hardy, put up your gun."
- Now!
"No, put up your gun."
"Hardy, damn it!"
This shit has got to stop.
If you have a drinking problem...
You were out of control.
Oh!
Thank you for letting me come with you.
you are so good!
Where are you going?
To find some food.
Stay and rest;
I'll be back.
please bless her.
Lord.
she's very old.
There's no need to apologize.
I know Master Boaz would want to help you.
You see those women there?
They're gleaners.
Many of them are widows like yourself.
Follow them and you can gather up all the loose grain you see.
Daniel?
her.
that you're welcome here.
sir.
When you drink a need... go to the well;
my men will draw it for you.
I am a Moabite; they may not want to.
I've ordered them to treat you kindly.
welcome.
My servants told me how you... how you gave up your home and your own people for the sake of your mother-in-law.
I think that's very kind.
May God bless you for it.
Thank you.
special needs.
Let some extra grain fall for her.
tell her she can just harvest some of her own.
The nearest one is two hours from here and it's not even that nice.
We have a perfectly fine room upstairs for your father and your daughter and... you can sleep in the living room on the convertible. but we really should go.
We can leave early in the morning.
as it were.
Pop?
Okay.
Sit.
you want some dessert? and hardly any sleep.
I'm fucking 90.
that's 101 reasons to keep moving.
Logan.
then what?
Then we take her to her friends in Eden.
And then we buy the Sunseeker.
Take the pills.
shit!
- What's going on?
- Nate!
Go fill up the tub before we lose pressure.
check the sink.
They shut it off again.
They are just not going to let this thing go.
you might as well handle it now.
It can wait till the morning.
We just had rain last night.
We got three houseguests and a sink full of dishes.
all right.
The pump station that supplies us is a mile and a half from here.
Sometimes it gets itself shut off.
- By assholes.
- Hey!
No.
Seriously?
You're scraping the crusty bits off the sides now?
I'm sorry but I'm an emotional eater.
"Hang on, hang on."
All right look the recipe says it serves 12.
I had one and a half you dropped one on the floor.
That means you had nine-and-a-half servings!
Well excuse me Little Miss Solve-Your-Fancy-Math-Problems.
I-Got-Into-Stanford- and-Your-Daughter-Didn't.
[Gasps]
You lashed out at me.
I'm sorry I didn't mean to.
Here.
Like I would want that.
Oh.
Okay.
Dang my generation's foolish beliefs that food can make the pain go away.
[Taking deep breath]
"Oh, it's okay."
"It's all right, I mean, we're jumping on each other."
Because you know we feel helpless and there's nothing we can do.
Although frankly a little bit more you than me.
Well excuse me but I don't think I recall throwing macaroni fractions.
In your face.
"Oh, do you wanna go?"
-Is this how it's going to be?
Is this how it's going to be?
"-That's the way it's gonna be, yeah."
Come on.
"Oh, all right I can't hear you with that in your mou... hi."
Hey.
-How you doing bud?
It was horrible.
Why don't you tell me about it?
Do you wanna tell me about it?
"Come on, let's stand."
Tell me.
(PANTING)
It was the same as last time.
"I was in this room, this red room."
"It was bright, blood red curtains, but there was no windows, no doors, so it didn't make sense, and I couldn't get in or out."
I was trapped.
"The curtains, they were on fire."
It was horrible.
It's okay.
"I was hunched in the corner, and I looked over into the other corner."
"And in the shadows, there was someone else there."
I could just see his eyes.
He was looking right at me.
It's okay.
It's over now.
"These nightmares, they will fade away, I promise."
Did they for you?
Yeah.
Come on.
Come on.
I'll sit with you until you fall back asleep.
Who else do I have to take care of?
They hoarded all of their greatest stolen treasures in here.
Piles of jewels and every room filled with coins.
Let's get to it.
The compass.
(SNIFFS)
What's your rush?
Sergeant Wu got a hit on Kimura at the palms motel.
"But when they went to check on the room, they were attacked."
- Are they okay?
- For the most part.
But it wasn't Kimura.
It was a woman.
And we're thinking he's working with a woman who's not to be messed with.
So watch yourself.
"You too, Hank."
We keep the cats on this side.
"If we kept them with the dogs and the birds, they'd be screeching and hollering all night."
"Okay, how do we know which is the cat we're looking for?"
"Well, the name of the owner is on every cage."
Do you know the name of the owner?
"Yeah, Schade."
Adalind Schade.
Okay.
"Oh, hello, Majique."
You don't look very sick to me.
"[Cat yowls, cage rattles]"
"Yep, that's probably the one."
How's it going?
Everything all right?
"Yeah, there's nothing happening out here."
All right.
See you in the morning.
"All right, stand back."
Stand back.
Don't get too close.
We got to knock this thing out.
"If you don't have any drugs that'll do it, a 2x4 would be fine by me."
- How's Juliette?
- Any progress in the Weng case?
"- No, none at all."
"I nearly got the suspect, but he escaped."
Where's your razor sharp intuition?
Many people want me to fail... so this case means a lot to me.
I don't need you letting me down.
You always were a pain in the ass.
Do me a favor and prove me wrong.
"Sir, I do nothing for nobody."
I'll get the murderer.
You'll get your promotion.
I hope you don't forget who helped you reach the top.
I want you to draw the suspect.
Try to bring him to life.
He's over 30.
He looks determined... without being ruthless.
There's something heroic about him.
He doesn't look like a killer.
He comes across so calm... acts like he has a dream... eyes full of passion.
- Hello.
"- It's me, Jeffrey."
Jeffrey?
Why haven't you left town?
I want my money now.
I want it tonight.
Tonight!
"Sure, I'll bring it tonight."
Mr. Weng.
You should let me handle Jeffrey.
He's my responsibility.
- What if he squeals on me?
- He wouldn't.
"So once a week, I can have BBQ with my brother."
"Or order a large pizza, or have raw fish."
He's so happy.
I have the dates.
"Yesterday, Mother and Hyang Gi's mother got the dates somewhere."
-When is it?
-Last Saturday of next month.
At Hyang Gi's pension.
Ok.
I would be lying if I say congratulations.
I won't congratulate you.
So today was our break up day.
That's too bad.
"Had I known, I wouldn't have gotten lost."
I wasted all that time.
I see why you got angry.
I knew something was wrong.
I practiced this moment way too many times in my bed.
I guess practicing helps.
You told me that we won't be able to get past this fall.
It's ok.
It's much better than I thought it would be.
"It's like, ""It's finally come."" Something like that?"
Good for you.
You're so ok.
I told you that I practiced.
Don't smile.
I don't want to see you smile.
You want me to cry?
"No, no, I can't do that."
You want me to cry my eyeballs out?
And maybe faint?
"Guys, this is too much."
What's too much?
Let's just get it together and chill out a little.
"Excuse me, I don't mean to disturb you."
My name's Dave.
Hi.
Ronnie.
Ronnie.
That's a great name.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Do you have a cell phone I could use?
Why?
Someone's got to call God and let him know one of his angels is missing.
"Wow, that is the worst line I've ever heard."
"Well, what do you want from me?"
I've been out of the game for a while.
I've been slumming it with a really hot redhead.
Now you're getting closer.
"Dave, if you're here to be an olive branch for Jason,"
I am not gonna talk about it tonight.
"I'm not here to talk about anything,"
I just want to see my wife.
Let's go.
I can't just leave these two.
I think they'll survive.
We sure will.
They are so lucky.
Now this next jam goes out to all you party people in the house!
"Everybody, up!"
"Let's keep this party going, y'all!"
"Maybe we ought to wait by the exit, so when people come out, you know..."
House owners fear you would sue them.
"- Since you approached me, I'll try."
You have a bike?
- Yes
- Can you take me on it?
- Do you ride well?
- Yes
-Then get your bike.
Too tall.
Only Anushka can ride on this.
It is this house on the left.
Stop.
My back aches.
-This is the 11th house I am showing you.
Please somehow arrange this house for me.
I should say that.
If you don't like this then I must arrange a film set at AVM.
- OK
The house owner is sharp.
Keep your voice down.
This is the best house in the area.
"The house owner has let you use the plants, old newspaper, bucket and everything."
We can fix this if it satisfies you.
The rooms are all very spacious.
But I don't need such big rooms.
How much is the rent?
"20,000 as rent and an advance of 10 months."
Oh!
"I can't afford 20,000."
Ask if he can reduce the rent.
- No its impossible.
- I told you already that he is sharp.
"Well, it depends on the size of the bottle and the size of the ship, to be honest."
"The way you have to, you have to force the ship through,"
SHIP through.
Can I use the toilet?
"That's probably not a question for me, right?"
"He's speaking to you, right?"
So...
Of course you can.
I can put shit in a bottle.
"Dermot, what the hell are you doing?"
!
"What do you mean, Dermot?"
!
What?
What's going on here?
!
"Sister, one second."
"Elsie, what are you talking about, don't blow cover yet."
It's time to blow cover.
"You've almost ruined it, you just fell asleep by eating one of those fucking chocolates, you idiot!"
I couldn't help it.
"Do you stand up, or are you going to sit down?"
I'll stand up.
"OK, ready?"
Let's blow this case wide open.
I've lost all control of my body.
"I'm so sorry, Elsie's had a..."
"It's all right, like, why is she calling you Dermot, right?"
"Well, what happened, she's, like I say, she's not..."
"Well, I'm no woman!"
What?
"I'm DI Sleet, from..."
"If it's one of your games, I want it to stop."
Stop being paranoid.
You don't have to be poor to have good intentions.
There are people with money and ideals.
- Really?
I'd like to meet one.
"- Hello, Jacob."
Give me a break.
You never had any ideals.
I could be rude about your ideals and we could go on and on.
- We could go on being rude...
- Then tell me what he wants.
He doesn't care about the orphanage or humanitarian work.
It's bad business.
What does he want?
I don't know what he wants to do with the orphanage and Anna.
"I don't understand it, Jacob."
Then let me ask you a different way:
Do you know something I don't?
"No, Jacob, I know nothing."
That's all I wanted to know.
- May I offer you a cup of coffee?
- No thanks.
- Dare I offer you a glass of wine?
- Only if you've got enough.
Right.
Dare I ask how you've been?
The last twenty years?
They've been a bit up and down.
And you?
I've been fine.
Also a bit hectic.
You saw your sister naked in the shower?
Sort of.
I was hiding in the laundry basket.
"Hey, Stacey."
"Hi, Brad."
I saw you in the drug store yesterday.
You were buying Juicy Fruit gum.
Are you going to the dance Saturday?
"It's a '50s sock hop, you know."
I'm thinking of going to the dance.
"Can I wear your jacket today, Brad?"
"Oh, come on, what do you want for it?"
I want to take you to the closet...
No way!
You are so bad.
What'd you say to her?
I told her what I wanted.
I don't think she's that kind of girl.
"She's a girl, Frank."
All girls are that kind of girl.
She didn't used to be a girl.
"Hey, guys."
What are we looking at?
What's that?
I think it's an elbow.
What's it doing with that other elbow?
Doesn't look like anything
"I ever want to do, that's for sure."
Will you stop cleaning?
Why do you do that?
My dad demands complete order and sanitation.
"I know a place where the girls are naked all the time, where guys can see naked girls all they want, 24 hours a day for anyone with guts and a hundred bucks."
I forgot...the Pacific.
"- No other ocean has so many colors.É"""
"- And look, you can see where the blues change."
"Black for you, white for you, black and white for you."
One's fine.
"So, which route should we take back?"
The pretty or the fast?
Fast!
Pretty.
"I work for my dad, and I don't have much time for a social life."
"But the other day,"
I met a guy named Scott who owns this bar.
I'm not here to flirt.
What's gonna happen next?
You gonna ask me to dinner?
"No, I..."
It's all right.
I always get hit on when I wear this T-shirt.
- Think my eyes are up here.
- I wa...
I-I...
"For the record, I wasn't looking."
And the only reason I was in his bar is because our biggest client wants to buy it from him.
"So, I took Scott to dinner, but just to talk business."
"Okay, we got a little distracted."
"Meanwhile, there's this other guy from the office,"
Stephen.
That's him.
My dad would love it if I were with him.
"I mean, Stephen's a nice guy, but there's not a lot of passion between us."
Back to Scott.
Forget your fucking hat.
Are you kidding me?
So I need a trip to Rockaway because you want your hat?
"I need it, I got to have it."
It's my lucky hat.
I never fly without it.
"Lois, do you understand what we are involved in here?"
I don't care.
I need my hat.
I won't fly without it.
What could I do if she insisted I drive her home for her goddamn hat?
I hid the package in the kitchen and went to take her home.
A hat?
What the fuck is this?
Police!
Freeze!
"Don't you move, you motherfucker or I'll blow your brains out."
Shut the car off slowly.
"For a second, I thought I was dead."
"But when I heard all the noise, I knew they were cops."
Only cops talk that way.
Don't fucking move.
"If they had been wiseguys, I wouldn't have heard a thing."
I would have been dead.
"Michael, lock the door!"
Talk to me.
When was the last time you took a collar?
"Fuckhead, I'm talking to you."
"You don't want to say a fucking word, don't."
I don't really give a fuck.
You'll do 25 years.
See how much of a good guy you'll be then.
Ted?
You feel a little bit better now?
You're in no danger here.
- These people don't want to hurt you.
- Sure they don't.
The FBI agent just happened to be on the train today.
She wasn't following you.
Wasn't watching you.
She expects you to believe that?
"Let them go, Ted."
I'll stay with you.
"You and I will do this together, only you need to let these people go."
I will wait with you.
No one wants to hurt you.
We don't want to hurt you.
We want to kill you.
- No!
"- No, it's okay, Ted."
"- Ted, it's okay."
- Don't!
I will make sure that they never take it out of you.
"If you hurt one more person on this train, I swear to God,"
I'll make them leave it in you forever.
What?
"Everything all right in there, Dr. Bryar?"
I want it out.
"Well, I'm sending two technicians in to remove it."
No!
One.
One technician.
"Well, it's a delicate procedure."
It requires...
I want you to go back in the kitchen and stay there till I tell you to come out.
"That way, in case they get trigger-happy, you'll be out of the line of fire."
And then you'll let me go?
I'll let you go.
(PLAYING HARMONICA)
"Byron, is that the road you went down?"
"Look, don't go in there fucking around."
"In and out, you got me?"
Now what do you think I'm going to do?
"Don't worry about it, all right?"
You sure this is it?
Yeah.
(WATER RUNNING)
(CAR APPROACHING)
You got it straight?
You got it straight?
Yeah.
"Hi, baby."
"Come on, Fantasia, let's go."
"It'll be a few minutes, Ray."
I got to pack my stuff up.
What the hell are you going to pack?
All you had was that little old goddamn purse.
"It won't be long, you all come on in."
Shit.
I'm going to be right back.
That's bullshit.
I'm sticking on your ass.
"Man, she better not have bought any fucking clothes."
How much she got to pack?
"Come on, come on."
"Be careful, honey, I love you."
Maybe that's what you're tryin' to do with me.
"What are you gonna do, Freddy?"
You gonna arrest the whole town?
"You goin' to New York to take ""paint by number"" cop lessons?"
"You know, Ray likes you."
That don't mean I'm gonna let you fuck him over.
"Ray Donlan gave you this job, Freddy."
You forgot that?
We made your sorry ass!
So now you can do us a favor.
You could tell us... where Superboy is.
"If I knew where he was, he'd be in the city already."
"You're gonna be hurtin', Freddy."
"You're not gonna know when, you're not gonna know where."
You're gonna be hurtin'.
You mark my words.
I'm watchin' you!
Hey.
- You got your check.
- Yep.
"Thanks to you, Freddy."
Filing out those forms in such a timely fashion.
You with Liz?
Where you goin'?
I don't know.
"My leave came, so I thought I'd look around for a new reality."
You know?
"Anyway, I'm sure you could use your privacy, Freddy."
"No, no."
"Look all you want, Freddy."
You're not gonna find anything.
I took care of it.
Next Thursday.
- That's great.
You have to do it.
- I don't know.
- You have to do it.
- Really?
Yes.
You've never been a part of an actual graduation ceremony.
I know.
That's because my conservative high school... wouldn't let me be in the ceremony and nurse you at the same time.
- Don't be gross.
- You think I should do it?
- You've worked hard.
You've earned it.
- I guess.
Come on.
You know that deep down you really want to do this.
I'll admit I've always wanted to wear one of those gowns.
And the hat?
For the tassel.
You know my thing for fringe.
"They call out your name, and people clap, and you get your diploma."
Then you do that thing where you move the tassel from one side to the other.
"Very symbolic, very dramatic."
- That's it.
You're doing it.
- If you insist.
- Who do you want to invite?
- I don't know.
You.
- And?
- That's cool with me.
- into a POW camp.
- Why would he do that?
After what he's been through?
Maybe it's not so bad.
"- Yeah, how's that?"
- Now we have someone on the inside.
"If the prisoners know we're trying to break them out during work detail, we'll have a better shot."
"But when we get them out, where do we hide them?"
I saw an abbey not far from here.
I'll go and make contact and see if they'll take them in.
Are you all right?
- I'm fine.
- There was nothing you could have done.
About Alfred running?
About René.
Nothing any of us could have done.
So let yourself off the hook.
They got him.
Doesn't mean they're going to get Alfred.
Let's make sure they don't.
This was Eric's bunk.
- Are you American?
- Any news from England?
He's Canadian.
And he goes by Eric Darcy now.
What happened to Eric?
His heart gave out.
On work detail.
- How far are we into Europe?
- I'm sorry.
It's not going well.
There is no Western front.
- Do we need to chain it up?
"- Nah, this will do."
- Cool?
- Cool.
"This is really the last time, I'm gonna say this to you."
Okay?
or anything else...
"I don't want you to send me anything anymore, I don't..."
I threw out those flowers.
You can't fix it.
And I'm really... done with you.
"I don't want talk to you again, I don't want to hear from you again."
I want you to leave me alone.
"Please, okay?"
You don't know how to fix this.
You can't fix it.
"You, have no clue."
Just...
leave me alone.
I don't ever wanna hear from you again.
"Wake me up, when the latch turns."
But what if...
"This isn't exactly the residence of a renegade, Daze."
But...
Just keep a look out while I go in dream about the dress.
Oh my God!
Is that the guy?
- What's going on?
- I don't know.
- Why didn't he take our guns or...?
- I don't know.
- Should we wake him up or just pop him?
I heard you got into an accident.
I only found out after I got out of the hospital.
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
"Oh, I-I'm fine now."
What happened?
It seems weird.
I'm going to your house right now with your stuff.
I'm close by so I'll be there soon.
Okay.
She said she's coming here...
Good.
"I was too busy to get Yoon Jae's things, but I guess she's doing it instead."
What about Yoon Jae's hospital?
Do I have to start working tomorrow?
You can't do that.
Say that because of the accident you need rest and get a break.
Then what about the marriage?
Do I have to do that too?
!
"Until then, he must come back."
He must.
"Even if he doesn't, I'm not planning on doing that for him too."
Do you want to clean while we're waiting for Se Young?
"Hah, I had to clean Yoon Jae's body."
Do I have to clean his house too?
No thanks.
"When you meet Se Young, have your manners and don't look at her with weird eyes."
I'll stare at her with open eyes.
Where is the vacuum?
"Oh, this is heavy."
I guess it wasn't an empty bag.
Looks like Yoon Jae packed his suitcase.
God damn it!
Is that your new waitress?
- You like her?
"You can have her, and give me Nora!"
I am not letting Nora go.
You can forget it!
Alright.
How's my money doing?
Still stuck to the wall.
"I'll stick you the wall too, my boy."
"I have a little time, and I have to show you this."
"Incidentally, I don't have any time."
You won't regret it.
"Listen, you just show up out of nowhere."
Couldn't you at least say please?
What's all this?
Why do you make everything so complicated?
Of course not then.
"I'm busy, goodbye."
Then at least stop singing.
"I have to get my show finished, you got that?"
Do you think you can just tell me what to do?
"Oh yeah, I think so."
"You're mistaken, my dear."
Put your lousy 10 Euros away.
I only take donations over a hundred.
I've thought about it.
In this case it's not a donation.
I would like something in return.
"What I want in return, is to touch you."
Go ahead.
What's going on here?
"Really, James, it's your own fault."
"You can't expect to worry yourself sick over Paul's death, and do your own job at the same time."
"I know, but-- - no ifs or buts about it."
You worried yourself into a really low state.
Now look what's happened.
I'm sorry.
"You're right, of course."
"I understand how you feel, but I want you to pull yourself out of it."
Promise?
If you promise not to go on about it.
It's a deal.
You just relax while I go boil another kettle.
Drink that up.
There's another one to come.
Who is it?
It's me.
May I come in?
If you don't mind catching flu.
How are you feeling?
Jolly good.
"James, let me ask you a question."
"Tris, I'm really not up to it-- no."
Shush.
Tell me...
"When is the last time we stood up to siegfried,"
I mean faced him out to the bitter end?
- Ah-- ah-- you see?
"You can't answer, can you?"
Because neither of us ever have.
We've always given in to him.
"Well, this time, I'm going to do it."
Do what?
How dare you do that to me?
Is this how you're going to be?
"I was willing to endure all the pain till the very end, but you torture me over this crap?"
Don't you remember?
I told you how hard it is to fight with images!
So just give me the facts.
Not your bullshit philosophy.
"You slept with her, huh?"
"Oh, that I know already."
Did you walk over me?
"You and that bitch walked over me, huh?"
I won't cry.
Just tell me.
- Then I'll be quiet.
- You're completely insane.
"Tell me, please."
"Just tell me, Joongrae."
"No, I can't."
I can't be treated like this.
I don't deserve this.
I just can't.
"Sorry, I'm leaving."
"R. The Best Beach on the West Coast, Shinduri"
- Thanks for coming.
- What happened?
- Do you have a cigarette?
- Yes.
There's such a muscle?
So there are muscles we can't use.
Guess it's like the appendix.
That's too bad.
You mustn't have worked on your script.
Do you remember the first day when you asked if the car wasn't working?
"I answered, ""lt's given up the ghost."" Do you remember?"
"That day, we were driving uphill."
The car gave up the ghost.
Yes.
It had worked too hard and gave up the ghost.
Yes.
What did I say?
"A car, just like men, can give up the ghost."
And I'll say it again now...
"Men, like machines, can give up the ghost."
Right?
You haven't worked this morning.
You're not tired.
"Yes, but... you know that's not always the case."
"Sometimes, when you're idle, you give up the ghost."
You understand?
You go crazy doing nothing.
You blow your top!
"All right, forget it, it's over."
Let's be friends again.
"Shake my hand. lf you can hear me, hold the line."
I'm going higher up.
Hold the line.
I'll see you later.
"Come on, Behzad."
"Forget the cemetery, come and eat some strawberries..."
Hold the line.
I'm listening...
Hello.
He told you that?
Did you give him my message?
"Look, leave that aside for the moment."
I shall deal with that first thing tomorrow.
I'll strike out into the icy wastes of the chilled dairy section.
I'll be like Captain Oates.
"Only, hopefully, I shall come back, but what I wanted to say, Enid, is,"
"I know this wasn't a date, but could it be?"
"Not this yoghurt blunderer's debacle, but could we go on a proper date?"
I'm going out with someone.
Oh.
So...
Right.
Sorry.
Doing my two short planks act.
I should have checked.
Sorry.
As you were.
Malcolm?
Yeah.
Did you manage to have a word with her?
No.
There's a lot going on.
We've got the dressage coming up.
"I mean, I will."
We might just have to tick along for a bit.
And don't keep bringing it up.
I've got enough on my plate.
I don't keep bringing it up.
"You said, once the girls had left school."
I can't just cut and run.
"Well, maybe I should cut and run."
Run where?
You're no spring chicken.
"I knew Paulie was still pissed at me, and he's such a hothead."
And I was worried about Jimmy.
"See, Jimmy knew if Paulie found out he was into drug deals with me"
Paulie would have Jimmy whacked even before me.
This is the bad time.
I didn't feel safe until I got home.
"Now my plan was to stay alive long enough to sell off the dope the cops never found, then disappear until I can get things straightened out."
Karen!
Fuck!
"- Where's the stuff I left, Karen?"
- I flushed it down the toilet.
You what?
What was I supposed to do?
They were all over the house.
That was worth $60.000!
I need that money!
That's all we got!
What was I supposed to do?
They had a search warrant!
That's all the money we had!
I was depending on that!
Why did you do that?
I had to.
They were going to find it!
- They would have never found it!
"- They would have, I swear to you!"
They would've found it!
Why did you do that?
- They would have found it.
"- Why did you do that, Karen?"
"Oh, my God!"
- I had to do it.
Chun-su!
"Chun-su, are you home?"
What's your business?
I didn't expect you here.
Where is Chus-su?
What do you want with a man in mourning?
Mourning?
Oh...
His old man was weak with asthma for a long time.
"Well, would you give him a message?"
He must pay his taxes without more ado.
Taxes?
Did you say taxes?
"You took a man and beat him to death, and you want to collect taxes?"
Are you accusing me of murder?
The whole village knows that he was dying of asthma!
What?
He died of asthma?
!
Say that again.
"Say that again, you bastard!"
I'll kill you!
I'll kill all of you and kill myself!
Chun-su!
Get out of there!
Don't aggravate a man in mourning!
Very well.
I'll go.
But he still has to pay his taxes.
If it is not receive within five days...
Get out of here this instant!
"Men, let's go."
Glad to see you've started to eat again.
You've been gone a long time.
I had business to do.
Did it have anything to do with me?
Maybe.
I have a right to know.
Have you sent the ransom note to my husband?
"My dear lady, the less you know, the better it's gonna be for both of us."
Especially for you.
Don't leave.
Please.
You mean that.
Do you?
I just wanted you to know that I read the books that you brought me.
Ah.
What did you think of them?
I liked them.
What I could read of them.
It's so dark in here.
It isn't easy to read.
No problem.
I'll bring you another lamp.
Anything else you want?
Do you think I could have a television set?
Smart.
"You think you're pretty damned smart, don't you?"
What do you mean?
You think your kidnapping will be on TV and you can find out what's going on.
I'm not thinking that.
"Well, it won't do you any good."
It won't help you get out of here.
I've thought of everything.
"In 1979, I ticketed a brown Dodge Diplomat for parking in a church zone."
That fine was never paid.
"And since then, that scofflaw has piled up more parking tickets than anyone in New York City."
For 16 years I pursued him only to see him give me the slip time and time again.
I've never got a clean look at his face but he's become my white whale.
"Mr. Kramer, that day was yesterday."
"But thanks to you, I don't know if I'll ever get that chance again."
I like that eye patch.
All right.
I'm gonna move my car.
My meter's up.
- You can't park in this city.
- Hey.
"George, you know that company I work for?"
They own the parking lot around the corner.
"- Oh, that's a Kinney lot?"
- Yeah.
There's a space opening and I could get it for you.
You'd just pay tax.
"It'd be, like, 50 a month."
Fifty bucks a month?
That's incredible.
Okay.
Thanks.
"I got lunch, all right?"
Still owe me a secret.
"All right, there is something I haven't told you."
- Yeah?
- But you can't tell Jerry.
"What do you think, I tell Jerry everything?"
It's not like he's my wife.
Okay.
"This way, we will forget each other."
I'll take him back whenever I want to.
Don't go!
I have to go after her.
Do you need to deal out pain in order to survive?
Even to a kid like that?
"She's not a kid, it's worse."
The worst must be me!
Want to bet?
"A proper little lady who would want the worst, is it able to suffer then?"
Is it trying to suffer?
Does one really suffer in theater?
You'll taste.
Feel.
I'll help you.
Come.
You dithering?
"If you pull out of me, you're finished."
Because of that?
That?
Lyon Station.
I owe you for this one.
"Oh, how happy Mickey will be!"
"For me, this is a pleasure, a vision of the Apocalypse, the Whore on her throne of blood, the fourth horseman, the lamb of the seventh seal, Kafka and his goldfish!"
Kafka and his goldfish.
Good.
Good.
There I can't.
I spent my holidays here with my father and mother.
My father died in that room.
A bullet to the attic.
I'm lying again.
"Mister, you wouldn't want to own a dog that couldn't pull a measly thousand pounds."
- Sounds like an easy way of making money to me.
- Sure.!
First he shoots off his mouth.
Then he won't go through with it.
"Well, my friend, these gentlemen seem to think I'm giving you the best of it."
"Don't do it, boss."
Let's go outta here.
A thousand dollars.
It's a bet!
It's a bet!
"I think you make one big mistake, mister."
"But, well, we go outside."
- Thornton's crazy!
"- If Jack says his dog can do it, he can do it!"
- Ten-to-one he can't!
- It's a bet!
- Any more takers?
- I'll take ya!
- I got a poke that says you're wrong.
- I'm right!
- But it dies dead to do that.
- The dog will do it!
"- Gee, boss, he can't do it."
He'll kill himself trying.
- Shut up.
You're not only doing this for money.
You're afraid of getting stuck here and losing that Blake woman.
"Oh, all right."
Your dog is to pull the sled a hundred yards from the standstill.
That's the bet.
A hundred yards.!
"I'm gonna say ""Jesus wept."" We gonna be right out of here."
- He knows how you...
- He gonna talk about Jesus for 20 minutes.
"He know he wept, okay?"
He did the weeping.
Let me get this bread.
[Laughing]
"All right, we gotta get her to the doctor."
What are we still doing here?
"Um, you know what?"
I got my niece and nephew to the dentist last week with some cookies.
I probably still have some.
Yeah?
What kind are they?
Mint Milano.
"She only likes Chips Ahoy, unfortunately."
"Well, how would your mom handle it?"
"Well, she would just eat the Milanos."
Or the Chips Ahoy.
"No, I mean how would your mom handle your grandmother?"
"Oh, she wouldn't put up with this, she'd just put her foot down."
"- Hit me, hit me."
"- Well, why don't you try that?"
"Oh, she's my grandmother."
I don't want to do that.
"Plus, she doesn't respect me because she thinks I'm an idiot clown."
"Well, you could... you could make her respect you."
"I mean, that's what your mom does."
"Maybe be a little forceful with her, and tell her we gotta get out of here."
"Yeah, you can do it."
- What's that?
"- Um, high five."
You've got just one thing to think about:
Allison.
"If you were gonna get married, why didn't you tell me?"
- You wouldn't have approved.
- You never gave me a chance.
"At least it would've been a proper marriage, not a cheap weekend affair."
- Don't say that.
"- Well, what was it?"
- I'd like to talk with you alone.
- You can talk to both of us.
"This has to do with the business, not your wife."
- I'll wait outside.
"- Okay, honey."
I can get it annulled.
I don't want trouble between us.
I was in love with Betty and wanted to marry her.
You weren't in love.
You had an itching for her.
"She took you, son."
She took you.
"Goodbye, Dad."
"- When you come home, don't bring her."
- Then I won't be there.
Rodney what about college?
I'm not going.
I have to support her.
"You can have a job here, if you work like everyone else."
That's good enough for me.
"Thanks, Dad."
"I knew you weren't coming down for lunch, so I thought... ."
"It's such a beautiful day, darling."
Why don't you get dressed and go for a walk?
I used to take my lunch down to the maintenance room and eat with the janitor.
It was nice until his wife called me a puta and made me stop.
Hang on.
It's the wildebeest.
Priya just made a snide comment about your acting career.
W-What the hell did she say?
"She thinks it's cool you're following your dream, no matter what."
That bitch!
How do you want to handle it?
"Um, okay."
Tell Bernadette to tell Priya that I'm on my way to Prague to shoot a movie with Angelina Jolie.
Got it.
Is it going to be in 3-D?
What?
I don't know.
It doesn't matter.
I'm gonna say 3-D.
That'll let her know the studio has faith in it.
You're kidding.
3-D?
That's what I hear.
Then the studio must have real faith in it.
Wonder why she didn't tell me.
Have you been spending time with your ex-girlfriend?
No...
Then why are you surprised she didn't tell you?
"Well, it's not as much ""surprised"" as you know..."
uh... the other thing.
What other thing?
"Well, if you... uh..."
I don't... oh...
What's the word I'm looking for?
- Come on.
"No,it's disgusting."
It was like a little freckle a month ago and then it just ran amuck.
"All right,now you're gonna have to show me."
"Seriously,you might be,like,sick."
Let us help.
I'm very sensitive about this.
Do not make fun.
I'm serious.
Do not make fun.
Okay.
"Promis promise,promise."
Oh!
No!
"Oh,my God,you guys suck."
"So,if I had one of those on my back, you wouldn't lust after me anymore?"
"Um... no,no,I wouldn't."
"Seriously,you should never show that to a potential soul mate ex."
Maybe it's a sign.
You should see if psychic chick can read it.
"Hey,what's up,guys?"
"Hey,dude."
- Morning.
"- Hey,man."
Late night?
What are you doing here?
It's a beautiful day.
I thought I'd take Rufus for a hike.
I don't like that you just show up here whenever.
Yeah?
Like how you just show up at my house?
Those were extenuating circumstances.
What's he waiting for?
I'll get it out of him.
Crates are loaded up.
I want a lead and a chase car.
Don't do the scenic route.
Let's get it behind ssr walls a.S.A.P.
"I'll wake up the eggheads,"
Start figuring out what the hell this stuff is.
"And, boys, drive carefully."
I don't want to be the one who sunk manhattan.
"I don't envy you, buddy."
My pal jack... he's got a special gift for interrogations.
"He's real convincing, gets guys to spill their guts."
That's not an expression.
We've had to use a mop.
I need a doc.
My arm's broke.
What's the point of fixing you up if we're just gonna break you again?
Was that dame working for you?
What dame?
The one on the boat...
"English broad, solid right hook."
English?
Yeah.
What's she look like?
"♪ let's jam that boogie, babe ♪"
"Ohh, damn it!"
What the...?
♪ why don't you come back ♪
♪ let's jam that boogie ♪
W-watch where you're going.
You're lucky this is a company car.
OK.
Mads?
"Right, all the doors and windows are locked."
No-one's getting in or out tonight.
You two OK?
"Yeah, Mrs S. Just a bit twitchy."
"Maddy, if there's something going on you better tell us now,"
- 'cause we're running out of time.
- Why are we doing this?
Didn't we have a great time last full moon?
Didn't we?
"- Well, yeah, but..."
- We were a proper wolf pack.
"Free, alive."
I had the best experience of my life.
And it was because I was sharing it with you guys.
"It was a special night, Maddy."
One of the best.
So why are we pretending like it never happened?
Because we're never going to do it again.
- Why not?
"- You know why not, Maddy."
It's not safe for us out there.
- We were fine!
"- No, we were lucky!"
What if we'd got shot at by a farmer?
or
Or we'd walked into a poacher's trap?
All it takes is one person to spot us and then they'll hunt us down.
- It's what they do.
"- Tell me you understand that, Maddy."
I do.
"You're not very proud of me, are you?"
"You know, Bob, I-"
I wasn't gonna give you your present till later... but I think I'll give it to you now.
I think it'll help you control your appetite.
"What is it, a muzzle?"
"Oh, honey that's a very expensive suit that I was so crazy about."
"Yeah, but you were crazy about it in a larger size."
"Bob, the waist is two inches smaller than your waist."
"I mean, I thought it would give you something to shoot for."
"I know you can do it, honey."
- Hi;
Bob.
Happy birthday
"- Oh, Hi, Howard."
"Well, I got your present."
Guess what it is.
- Feels like lead.
"- Yeah, go ahead, Open it up."
See for yourself.
It's a belt.
"Yeah, I, got it in Tokyo."
It takes the weight right off.
"I had a hard time, finding your size there."
Not too many guys as heavy as you are in Japan.
- Is this the way you wear it?
"- Yeah, you wear it under your clothes."
"Uh, here."
Let me show you with your coat here.
Wear it playing tennis or handball or golf.
Just don't go swimming in it.
"I'll get it, honey."
Oh.
The guy is sitting at a table with Paul Anka and he goes light?
"I was wondering if you have an address, phone number, last name."
He robbed one of our guests.
"Oh, you gotta be- Oh, I am so sorry."
"No, it's not your fault, but I was just wondering if maybe you could help me find him."
He was just a fill-in.
He was referred to me by one of my clients.
"You know Pomona, dancer at the Rhino?"
"No, Stan, I don't."
You don't?
She was here just yesterday.
"I don't know her, but maybe you can tell me a little bit about her."
She lives in Henderson.
I got her in zero coupon bonds.
She just got herself a new Mustang convertible.
I want to-
"And for what it's worth, if you ever see her, uh, they're real."
Whoa.
I want an address.
All right.
"You got it, boss."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Thank you.
Sorry.
Sorry.
- I want that man fired.
- I'm not sure we can do that.
Says who?
Fired for what?
He's cost this hotel a lot of money.
Let me tell you about something that'll cost a lot more.
It's called a wrongful termination suit.
Get word through to Dale.
[CAR APPROACHING]
"It's okay, I didn't print it."
[EXHALES]
Hey!
It's Stacey!
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
"What do I gotta do, fight my way back in?"
Come on!
And you won't say why you came back and gave yourself up?
You know what it means.
"What is this, a guessing game?"
"According to rules, it means the book and the Hole, but not for me."
I only came back for the weekend.
"You made it out once, Stacey, but you'll never do it again."
We'll see how it works out.
"Now, do I get that plush-lined cell in solitary, or don't I?"
All right.
Everything set for the break?
Yeah.
You coming in with us or not?
"I don't love life much, but I don't hate it enough to stick my head in front of a screw's bullet."
Be a wise guy.
Stick around here and maybe it won't be a screw's bullet.
Maybe you'll get what Lassiter got.
What about Lassiter?
He's on his way home.
Home?
Out the back gate in a hearse.
When'd it happen?
Four o'clock this morning.
Enough about me.
Let's talk about you.
"No, I don't feel like it."
"You know, I don't think that we should waste all your hard work."
What say we split the fee?
"You just tell me where he is, I will do all the rest."
It's easy money.
"Evelyn, I appreciate all the effort you've put into this... but there comes a time where you have to walk away."
Come on.
Isn't there something I can do to persuade you?
There's nothing you can do.
Know what I love about Miami?
"Apart from you, of course."
The cheap labor.
"You know, I can get a kid off the street to do a hit for about, mmm, grand."
"Well, if I flirt with him a little."
"Say, now, isn't that Lucy?"
Lucy!
Lucy!
"- Michael, I am so sorry."
- It's not your fault.
"Yes, it is."
You taught me better than that.
It was so stupid.
I should have been more thorough.
- I've got guys headed to her hotel right now.
- It won't matter.
I know.
I just feel like I should do something.
You should.
"You should be careful, 'cause she's still out there."
Right on time.
My uncle says it'll come and take me
If I don't do my chores.
"He said that, huh?"
"Well, then, if we get rid of it, you've got nothing to worry about, you'll never have to do chores ever again."
- Really?
- Yes.
"Look, go away."
What?
"As far as we know, no one was taken last night, but it will strike, and soon."
We'll kill it before that happens.
You must be great at parties.
We're talking about a hundred square miles of forest here.
be patient.
Ronon's been going up against the wraith one on one for the last seven years.
"If anyone can track this thing, it's him."
"And exactly how is he going to do that, huh?"
It helps to have good hearing.
Right.
Carry on.
What about you?
You sensing anything?
I'm not sure.
What do you mean?
There is a presence here... but it is different.
I cannot quite explain it.
It's in there.
Ronon!
Damn it.
It's in there.
- Was it wraith?
- Yeah.
- You see it?
Yikes.
"Okay, for your information, Richard, I have had plenty of sex."
I don't tell you everything.
I've had it under my belt.
"Over my belt, around my belt."
"You know, I've pretty much worn out my belt."
Really?
So plenty of sex?
"Hey, when I gots to have it, I gots to have it."
"Look, it's not a competition."
You'll be ready when you're ready.
"Hey, I'm ready."
I'm ready right now.
Then I gots to go.
I didn't mean from you.
I got plenty guys coming here to get some sex...
"All right, what about the one with the mystic tan and the butterfly clip?"
"Yep, I think she's having sex, too."
Are you kidding me?
What about you?
Are you doing it?
"You know, maybe sex isn't your thing."
Maybe your thing is more having awkward conversations with your employees.
Sex used to be my thing.
"God, in fact, senior year in high school, I was a little bit of a slut."
That's what I was known for.
"I mean, that and my laugh."
You do have a nice laugh.
"Oh, thanks."
"God, I used to be fun."
"Then I became a mom, you know."
I used to be turned on by the touch of a man.
[Shouting] Ah!
"Yes, Virginia!"
There is an escape clause.
Come on.
"You really had me going there for a while, you little devil, you."
You'll get changed.
You'll get all cleaned up.
"Oh, good idea."
I'll do that.
Right after I see Col. Potter and take the oath.
He was drunk.
He didn't know what he was doing.
"Sure, I did."
I was drinking.
"Look, Vickers caught Klinger with his heart down."
It'd be criminal of you to swear him in now.
- You just can't do it.
"- Slow down, Pierce."
The boy's not drunk now.
Let him have his say.
Face it.
I'm a poor kid off the streets.
The only real experience I have is hustling pool.
Now I have a chance to rise through the army's ranks and make something of myself.
"- Pretty sober thoughts, Pierce."
- Come on.
He's crazy.
Nobody but an idiot would ever reenlist.
I wonder if you can think of any exceptions to that rule.
Take your time.
I can wait.
I'm going to be here a while yet.
I'll... go with them.
"My Lady, the trip will be very rough."
Everything will fall apart if something happens to you.
I'll get what we need.
Trust me.
Let me go.
I don't want to send you on such a rough journey.
I'm afraid too.
But whenever I'm scared...
I'll think of you.
Of how you lead the migrants.
I won't die in vain.
Don't worry.
I'll come back... and help you realize your dream.
You must get back and look after the people.
This is a steel sword.
It's the best there is.
Even stronger than the Han's or Puyo's.
You'll get to make these too.
"Mopalmo, Mopalmo..."
Mopalmo.
"Shh, I'm in the middle of a lesson."
Forget the lesson.
Come here for a minute.
People are saying that the Commander is dead.
I'm afraid all this might get out of hand.
We knew this would happen but there's nothing we can do.
It'll all blow over when the Commander returns.
It's out of our hands.
My goodness.
We have to do something.
The chiefs are having a meeting.
"There's always going to be a little J in you and a lot of ""D"" in me."
"Well, we did it."
That's the worst conversation of all time.
"Don't worry about it, man."
I'm not even bummed out that you're moving out.
That's OK
"That's so weird because your pants are on fire but you're a liar, liar."
I spent all day dividing up our stuff.
Most of it was pretty obvious.
- All the make-up was...
- It's sunscreen!
Alright?
Don't piss me off.
Look.
Just admit that you're sad.
Why don't you get off my butt?
"What am I, Kanye West?"
I don't know what that means but let me ask you a question.
"Two weeks from now when you walk into that empty room and I'm not there, what are you gonna do?"
I'm probably gonna be doing a lot of this.
Because that's where I'm going to put my new Nordic Track.
OK.
We need to stop them from fighting.
Yeah for sure.
I agree.
Why don't you just call me when you have that figured out.
- Wait.
I don't have your phone number.
- I know.
I don't have anyone's number.
Get off your Nordic Track and talk to me.
- What is that?
The letter wouldn't be at Crescent Beach.
Maybe not.
"While I'm at the club, I want Martinelli at police headquarters."
- l don't see the connection.
- Nobody can without opening the back of your car.
The trunk compartment.
Louis Ord's body's back there.
- How long you been driving?
- l didn't see the signal.
- lt was my f ault.
- Let's see your driver's license.
I just told her something that startled her.
It must be here. I know it is.
"It better be, unless you want to come along to the station house."
- lt isn't here. lt just isn't here.
- Keep your head.
I guess we're hooked.
She must have left it in some other bag.
That's the standard answer.
Can we stop by the mayor's office?
We got a date with His Honour.
"He's your pal, I suppose."
"No, but he told me that if I got Mrs. Chandler there by 4:00, he'd marry us."
That's what I'd just told her when we went through that stop signal.
is that a f act?
And I hardly know him.
Okay.
Get along with you.
"Hey, wait a minute!"
"- What did you say, lady?"
- l said yes.
That was close.
"I mean, I do know, but I'm embarrassed."
"Kaitlin, you come in here all the time, and you look right through me like I don't even exist."
I'm sorry.
Don't be.
"I mean, why would a girl like you pay any attention to a guy like me ?"
I know the only reason you'd ever get to know me is if you had no choice.
"Tonight, that happened, and it felt like fate."
I didn't want it to end.
"I guess, I mean, that's understandable."
"But what do you mean, you didn't want it to end ?"
What the... ?
Mom...
It's okay.
Frank !
Just got your message.
I was so worried.
"Oh, me, too !"
Go for it.
There was a flipping earthquake.
But wait.
How did you get here ?
What about the pier ?
What about it ?
The pier is fine.
There's a heartbeat.
Thank God.
"The baby is under stress and, after a fall, there can be a rupture."
Separation.
Can you treat that ?
We still have some more tests to run.
"Okay, I've always wondered this."
"In your opinion, who is a better food industry server ?"
I'm singing on our record and I'm going to play you it on it.
I don't think I like singing.
You're not making a record.
He's not making a record.
He's down there now.
On a bench.
Who?
Tubby.
He's having...
I can't see if it's a pie or a pasty.
I think it's a pasty.
I might go and sit in the sun.
Don't say anything to him.
He's made his point.
I'm not going to say anything to him.
I'm not totally crass.
"So, she told me what you said to her, Enid."
She's just a person.
Bit lonely.
Probably been dumped a few times.
Picked a wrong 'un.
We all make mistakes.
That's why they put rubbers on the end of pencils.
Nobody's perfect.
"I'm fat, so I shouldn't be having a pasty, but I am."
Same with Enid.
And what have you done with your life that's so great?
You're not Albert Schweitzer.
Unless you're running a leper colony of a weekend and keeping that under wraps.
Would it be possible to have a word?
"""I'm the first to wade in when there's been a misdemeanour."
"""Bang."
I'm cold.
It's actually about 110 in here.
There's no way it's warm in here.
- Do you really feel warm?
- You could grow tomatoes in here.
"Honestly, it is unbelievable."
"Well, I can't make it cooler for you."
"Well, we're taking the credit."
"No, we're taking the credit."
How about a compromise?
We'll take all the credit.
"- Well, perhaps we could split the bounty?"
- What bounty?
"Well, I'm guessing there's no bounty, but..."
"Dan, Amy, how are you?"
I'll take it from here.
- I want to take in Pierce.
"- Whoa, whoa."
"No, no, no."
We are not going into the White House and blowing our cover for this guy.
You can't come in.
That comes from the president.
"- Well, she's a bitch."
- I'll tell her you said hi.
"Hey, we got to get moving."
"Hey, you guys."
Long time no see.
"Jesus, Mike, they got you involved in this?"
You're the fucking press secretary.
Thank you.
That's what I've been saying.
I have no wish to be embroiled in this either.
DONALD MACKAY:
"Well, there's no law against carrying a rifle."
DONALD MACKAY:
"Well, there's no law against carrying a rifle."
You do so yourself.
"Not a bloody machine gun, I don't."
You do so yourself.
"Not a bloody machine gun, I don't."
And they made sure we know.
And they made sure we know.
WOMAN:
"Yeah, to put the wind up us, Don."
WOMAN:
"Yeah, to put the wind up us, Don."
I reckon they got a tonne of that weed on the go.
I reckon they got a tonne of that weed on the go.
"Well, any chance you can jot down their numberplate"
"Well, any chance you can jot down their numberplate so I can take it to the police, give them something concrete?"
"so I can take it to the police, give them something concrete?"
"Yeah, sure."
OK.
"Yeah, sure."
OK.
"Look, I'll keep it for 14 days."
"Look, I'll keep it for 14 days."
Give me a bell when you've made up your mind.
Give me a bell when you've made up your mind.
"Nice to see you, Margaret."
"Yeah, thanks, Don."
"Nice to see you, Margaret."
"Yeah, thanks, Don."
Do you always have to be such a hero?
Give me your keys.
Give 'em to me!
"Oh, for the love of God."
"Mom, you want me to... no."
"Mom, come on, let me just... mom."
What is going on with you?
Is this about Allison?
Do you really wanna know?
Is this about your father?
"It is, isn't it?"
"Okay, you know what, um..."
We'll talk about this at home.
I'm gonna go get the car.
I'm the worst son ever.
"Well, I'm not exactly winning any prizes either."
Dammit!
"You give him a restraining order, and he's mocking you!"
He was mo... and what do I do about going to the bathroom?
So why do we need their help?
Because it's harder to kill than I thought.
I still don't know who it is.
And they do?
They might.
Which is why I need one of you to get on their good side.
Scott or Stiles?
Either.
"You know, the full moon's coming, Derek."
I'm aware of that.
These look comfortable.
You said you were gonna teach us to change whenever we wanted.
There hasn't been time.
"But if you have to lock us up during the full moon, that means you're alone against the argents."
I gotta go to Canada.
That's fine.
I like maple syrup.
I gotta go to Canada alone.
Why?
"If I get caught and you're with me, you're in trouble, too..."
You're not gonna get caught.
How can you say that?
You think crossing the border's easy?
We get fake IDs and passports.
Those cost money.
We have a stolen car!
We make it legit.
We take a VIN number off of another car.
"Emma, I'm not going to have you in the seat next to me..."
"Wait, wait, wait, seriously, wait, wait, wait!"
What if I go and get the watches out of the locker?
No one's looking for me.
"We can fence them, and then we'll have the money."
We could do whatever we want.
"We can go wherever we want, right?"
We could change our identities and go to Tallahassee.
"So, you want to steal the watches to help me get away with stealing the watches?"
Yes.
That is exactly what I wanna do.
- I can't let you risk everything...
- I love you.
"I love you, too."
You think you can do it?
I know I can.
You ready?
Yeah.
Could you be deflecting right now?
Not very effectively.
"What do you want me to say, Sheldon?"
I want you to talk about how you're feeling.
Do you want to hold the baby or not?
Yes.
"I know what you're doing, Violet."
It's not gonna work.
I'm not doing ything.
Look at this guy.
Do you mind watching him?
I could really use a shower.
"It's not gonna work, Violet."
I'm a professional psychiatrist.
You're not gonna confuse me with a baby.
And I think you have my ears.
I'm sorry about that.
"Yeah, I am."
No.
"No, no."
She told you?
"No, no, she can't take the blame for this, please."
"Can you give us a moment, please?"
Thank you.
"No, what are they gonna do to her?"
They're gonna try to get her some help.
Don't you think we've tried?
"Michelle, I understand the urge to lie, to protect your family, but we couldn't let you say that it was your fault when it wasn't."
But it is.
It is my fault.
"I was on drugs when I was pregnant with her, for the first couple of months, before I knew I was carrying her."
Michelle...
"Yeah, and he'll be shooting after the windows go."
- It's the best we can do.
- All right.
Stand by.
"Turn it on, or I pull the trigger."
- I can't turn it on.
- Why not?
Why not?
- Because it has to be implanted.
- She's right.
The chip derives its power from tiny electrical impulses fired between neurons.
It has to be in your skin to work.
- I really gotta...
- Sit down!
You're not going anywhere.
See?
Dude actually had a chip in his arm.
"All right, it seems calm for now."
Reid's still on the train.
Now we have two agents in there.
It's probably the Higher Authority.
I told you.
I have protocols to follow.
I was supposed to go right back out there.
I have rules.
Answer the phone.
"You want me to stay, I'm obviously going to stay."
"But, I mean, you're going to be the one that has to explain it to the Man."
"Whoa, ""the Man""?"
"They're still trying to tell you what to do, Ted."
Why can't you all just leave me alone?
Leave you alone?
The omaya reservoir is inserted in the parietal lobe.
"My spatial recognition is the issue, not my memory."
Did you say omaya?
I could have sworn you said biopsy.
"Hey, I'm just messing with your head."
"Mother's maiden name, please."
"Get out of my temporal lobe, house."
Hello?
Are you awake?
They told me somebody was sick like me.
I'm up.
Your voice... aren't you my doctor?
Not anymore.
You're the guy who doesn't like cops.
Yeah.
Can you see?
You can't?
Not a thing.
You've been blind a while.
The fact that you're aware of it now... it could be a sign of improvement.
It hurts so much.
Doesn't it?
I'm okay.
It's gonna hurt.
The morphine barely takes the edge off.
"I'm gonna die, aren't I?"
"You die, I die."
It's not gonna happen.
Why not?
You're just too stubborn to die?
They took a piece of my brain.
Whatever's wrong with us... they'll find.
Let's get a coffee.
I don't want a coffee.
"Well, I do."
"So whatever character assassination you've got lined up for me, let's at least temper it with caffeine."
Who found her?
Some new lot just above us.
Had reason to pop into the loft and there was old fatty.
Only not so fat any longer.
Don't talk like that.
SHE SIGHS
The gossip on the street says it was a suicide.
"Come home, Peg."
We can't talk here.
I can't go back there.
I can't spend another night in that flat.
"Well, then we'll move."
"We'll put it on the market, we'll buy somewhere else."
"(It's not the flat, Elaine, it's you!"
)
(I can't be with you any longer!
)
Think very carefully about what you say next.
I've hired a van.
I'll be round on Friday to get what's mine.
You don't have to be there.
"In fact, it's better if you're not."
THUNDER
HE SIGHS
Most people miss first time.
You're going to be late.
SHOWER RUNS
KNOCKING
Paul!
What is it?
- They've taken him!
He's come and taken him!
"Oh, he has him now!"
I'll never see him again!
And he'll tell him everything!
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to call Washington.
The police?
No!
"It'll get in the papers, and wherever he is, he'll see it!"
He'll show it to him!
All we've been trying to hide!
Washington has known all along about you and Paul.
They've had to.
It's their business.
"But I swear to you, they'll keep this thing absolutely quiet."
"When I tell them to, it will break in every paper in the country."
"It will be hard for him, but I think that boy has enough spirit to outlive anything."
"Spin around, Sonny."
That's the ol' kid.
"Getting hot, Paulsy walsie?"
"How about a nice, cool drink of ice water?"
"You wouldn't give me the sandwich, you won't give me the water."
You heard that?
I guess that told you!
"I don't know whose kid he is, but he's as game as a pit dog!"
"That's throwing it in there, kid!"
"Whoever his old man is, he ought to be proud of him!"
"Come on, Curly."
What are we waiting for?
I will ask them to connect the electricity power supply.
"As long as he was alive and living in this building, it had become Chel e Moori_"
There were going and coming.
Food was ready all the time.
The smell of his brewed coffee could be heard on the other side of village.
But where is he now?
Nobody is here to take a breath.
- Mashti
- Yes
This money is my carfs income.
That's ok_ Count it down.
Leave.
I accept it.
I want you to count it down in front of me.
Just leave and don't disturb my job.
"Ifl leave now, you can't say that a hundred toman is missing on the next day."
"No problem, leave and don't disturb my job."
I won't accept if you blame.
Leave.
I trust you.
"Go, boy!"
Don't stop here.
"I don't need your cart, I am waiting for taxi."
You can't find any taxi here.
"Yes, Iwill_ Leave it."
Where are you going?
I want to go to the other side of the port
"Even if you say the other side of the world, Iwill make it."
I want to go there by taxi.
Put it down.
- You haven't had breakfast yet.
- lt's late.
"- Sailing orders, Crawford."
"- Thank you, sir."
- I report to Jarvis in Corsica?
- Correct.
With all possible speed.
Try to avoid any side issues on the way.
How's your glass?
"Your first lieutenant, Mr. Scott-Padget what do you make of him?"
- He is both efficient and keen.
"So keen, he's out with the press gang."
I hate tattling.
"No cursing his efficiency and devotion to duty, but I should warn you..."
"If you'll forgive me, sir, I'd prefer to make up my own mind."
No.
Don't!
You mustn't resist the king's pressmen.
We've only been married three days.
- You don't want him!
He's not a sailor.
- We shall teach him.
Don't take him from me.
You can't!
- I beseech you.
Have pity on us.
- Bring him along.
These men are from the Defiant.
Press gang.
- From our ship.
"- We're Navy, they can't touch us."
We'd have some explaining to do.
- Come with us.
"- You can't, he's a gentleman."
Or not.
And you don't have the harder part.
I have the harder part.
He wants me to meet him at his house and lie to Mr. Boykewich.
"If we all get caught, what's Mr. Boykewich going to think of us after all he's done for us?"
He's going to think we're Ben's friends.
But we don't want Ben with Dylan.
We don't like Dylan.
She's okay.
"No, she's not."
She got him in trouble.
"First it was the pot, then it was the fire, what's next?"
Is she going to have him murder someone?
No.
I'm not going to do it.
I don't like her.
And I don't like him dating her.
"And for once, he should do what his father tells him and we should encourage him to do what his father tells him."
That's what a real friend would do.
That's not what a real friend would do.
A real friend would do anything a friend needs him or her to do.
I'm happy you said that.
Anything?
Yeah.
What if Ben asked you to have sex with him.
"Well, that's ridiculous."
Ben would never ask me to have sex with him.
Ben didn't...
"Ben didn't ask you to have sex with him, did he?"
Did he?
Did you?
When!
That's not what I mean.
I told her many times that she should be writing her own book.
So why are you giving this now?
I could because I was afraid I'd hurt her.
It'll be enough for a year.
"Until she can support herself by writing novels,"
I'll sponsor her.
- Take it back.
- Jae Min.
I've never told her I'd sponsor her so that she could write her own material.
"And even if I did, she'd never accept it."
You still don't know her at all.
You want to forget it with this?
You want to make me into some kind of matchmaker?
Should I take half and give the other half to her?
"Fine, the you that I know isn't that kind of person."
But this is an insult to the feelings she had for you.
She isn't someone you can console with money.
"Yeah, you're right."
I didn't think.
I was hoping you'd help.
How is she?
She's doing well.
She's strong.
"The harder it is, the stronger she acts."
I know.
How are you?
I'm just... being dragged along.
Let's get up.
Yeah.
Sorry.
Where's your car?
Why didn't you tell Mother that?
I didn't think of it.
"I'm a cowardly, despicable person."
For twenty years all I thought about was how to avoid being despised by your mother.
"And then one day, all of a sudden, a thick barrier had grown around her heart."
Forgive Mother.
I'm the one that has to be forgiven.
"What are you going to do, Shinako?"
Are you going to go live with your Mother?
"If she's going to live with Takehara, I'll stay with you."
I'd feel sorry for you.
The people who are really burned in all this are you and Takao.
So you've made up your mind?
You should leave that house.
That would be the thing for you to do.
He doesn't deserve to be with you.
I don't want you to insult him.
"Oh my, aren't we complex?"
"Ok, I won't insult him."
So are you going to build that studio?
I'm not going to see you again.
You're terrible!
This is really too much.
It's late.
Please go home.
"Mrs., listen."
waited twenty years.
So did I.
What are you doing?
I'm going to call someone.
Mrs.!
Let me go.
"So, you met the boys."
- Yes.
- They take great pictures.
First the good news Franz.
My boss says the location is perfect.
Yes?
What does that mean?
"That means as soon as the contracts are signed, we'll do a casting."
- What?
Someone will play me?
What do you think?
Will this work?
Get rid of the Jesus business!
"Yeah, but it somehow works with the whole revolution thing."
Explain to me why they won't work together?
Why won't they work together?
!
Just settle down.
"Franz, I have the contracts with me..."
Let's find a quiet place where we can talk it over.
It's quite the opposite.
The people don't want to see authenticity.
Stars!
That's it.
"Every once in a while, we'll throw in an average guy."
That will freshen it up a bit.
Could Franz be that guy?
It's not my job.
That's up to the casting people.
"- But the Hotel, that stays in."
- That'll be something.
That's true.
How many chances do you think you'll get to be a dickhead?
One more?
Wrong.
You're a nasty little virgin.
See ya.
"Right, fair enough."
OK.
"Best of a bad lot, deal with what we've got."
"I need you, we're in trouble."
I'm off.
Only popped in to check out your missus.
"Well, thanks for popping by and ruining my love life."
No problem.
I hope you and your ignorant boss get a good laugh out of it.
I'll tell you who'll be laughing last!
Me!
Cos I'm not the one who'll be working in a shitty garage doing manual labour for the rest of my life.
See you Monday.
No you won't!
Because I'll be at a local paper.
"That's right, a local newspaper."
"So my date, yes, date, was a disaster."
But at least my friends weren't hiding in the toilet.
"Oh, they were."
There was only one person for saving us now.
"Thanks for stepping in, mate!"
I was going to dive when you put your cock away.
"- Budge up a minute Jay, I need a piss."
"- You're not pissing in here, Neil."
- Why not?
It's a toilet.
- Go outside if you have to.
Hey... hey Dale.
Look it's ZACH!
Come on let's go inside for a minute.
It's crazy.
Yeah it's... it doesn't make any sense to me sometimes.
Listen I didn't get a chance to talk to you
I wanted to see if you wanted to go to dinner next week?
Um I can't.
I didn't even give you a day.
Well I know I'm sorry I'm just...
I'm slammed right now.
Working this retarded dating reality show.
OK.
Well I mean look if you're not too busy then maybe you can make it by my show at the label next week.
We can hang out after that?
Yeah... cuz
-Yeah...
You didn't exactly make that show you promised you'd come to the other night.
Oh I'm sorry.
It's Ok.
- I totally forgot.
Hey you know what next week though for sure.
"Ok good, because you had me a little bit worried there."
You know?
It's not like you to just drop off the grid like that.
You're my LA comfort food.
You know?
I need to see you every so often.
LA comfort food...
I like that.
I'm sorry it's just been one of those months.
You know that photographer JP and I...
I need you to let me keep her in the hospital for another 48 hours.
You did not just interrupt my dinner to ask me to hide your patient from the law?
Do you really think that putting an 11-year-old girl in jail is the right thing to do?
She stabbed her father.
So let's help her.
Let's not throw her to the wolves and just hope they decide to raise her.
You're not social services.
You fixed her arm.
You did your job.
"Look, I feel bad for the kid, too."
Do you?
"Because I really can't tell, because it's like nothing bothers you."
"It's like you didn't get fired, like Violet didn't almost die."
It's like I'm... it's like I'm heartless?
Violet.
Lucas is in his crib.
I'm just trying to sleep.
"I love you, olet."
"I'm really tired, Pete."
All right.
Just listen.
Before all this... we had a chance.
We had a... we had a real chance.
"And then katie attacked you, and..."
I've been doing everything I can think of to help you get past this.
But it's not helping.
What I'm doing... it's not helping.
So...
I'm gonna go home.
What?
You're leaving?
What about Lucas?
"His peers, his public."
They'd find out what kind of a husband he is.
Letting the great Gillian Booth rot away.
His vanity couldn't stand it.
"He'd, he'd... be shamed into action!"
"Yeah, as long as he was your husband, maybe."
I wonder what my partner is saying to him now.
What is she saying?
"Well, in that red file is a report of the search we did in your dressing room and the dental resin we found on the sink in your bathroom."
I think your husband's about to find out how he got that bite mark on his neck.
Please don't.
Stop her.
Don't let him see it.
Please stop her.
This should be interesting.
"Sneaky, pathetic bitch."
Frame me for murder.
How could she?
It was to blackmail you into a marriage.
I was duped.
- I want an annulment.
"- Yes, Philip."
File the papers today.
I'll call the movers.
I want her out of my home.
Every last trace of her.
I don't care if she dies in the gutter!
No!
"No, Philip!"
Don't say that!
"- He's leaving. / No, please."
"- Go talk to him, talk to him."
# We burn it all down
# Cos all our lives
# We're waiting for something new
# Waiting for someone like you
# We are the people
# Who let this whole thing go
# Just like the people you know
# We are the reason
# We're blinded by the goal
"# We are the people, you know"
"# Burning away, light in the sky"
# So you can bring us home
"# Further, further down an open road"
# We've torn it all down
# Why do we pray?
# Why do we talk about angels?
# Flying with their golden wings
# We've burned it all down
# Cos all our lives
# We're waiting for something new
# Waiting for someone like you
# We are the people
# Who let this whole thing go

Did I tell her who I am?
Who you think you are.
Oh.
"Oh, we're back to this."
Good.
Who's Gracie?
Tell me what this means.
I...
I don't know.
I swear.
I...
I just wanted the headphones.
Cut me down!
That's the break that you wanted.
"Now, if we'd had that before I went and told you to let it go... you were right."
There was more to this.
"Now, you can give it to your cipher unit, or we can give it somebody who thinks in code."
Otto Goodwin.
You're gonna want him on this.
Just trust me on that.
Otto:
It's beautiful.
We thought it was some kind of...
Oh...
"Some kind of drug accounting book that the names would be suppliers, dealers."
"The numbers would be amounts, delivery dates, maybe payments."
It's chess.
It's what?
It's not drugs.
It's chess.
These names are grand masters.
"The owner of this notebook was playing them, anticipating moves, countering, often beating them."
"You know, it's still too soon to really know how you feel."
Let's give it another day.
I want you to quit.
"Let's be super, super sure."
"(Man over PA) Frankie, you have a call on line one."
Sue wants you to quit.
It was settled then.
I was just gonna have to quit.
Why do I have to quit?
Just 'cause Sue has stupid crazy eyes?
Maybe I don't wanna quit.
So don't quit.
"Yeah, sure."
Right.
"I won't quit, and then I'll be the worst mother in the world."
Ohh!
"You know, it's not fair."
"I'm really loving it, Mike."
"The people there are so nice to me, and I get to wear these pretty costumes, and they bring me tea."
Nothing has made me this happy in years.
No offense taken.
(Sighs) And they like my voice.
"The last time I sang in the car, the kids threw cheetos at me."
Wow.
Must have really hated it to give up cheetos.
Ohh.
Why do I always have to make the sacrifice just 'cause I'm the mom?
"Frankie, you work hard."
"If you've found something that makes you happy, you should stick with it."
"I know, right?"
And she's not a kid anymore.
"If Sue's upset, well, that's life."
Right.
The thing.
"Yeah, look, I'm sorry about that."
"Afterwards, I thought it through and..."
- l can see how you got upset about it.
"- No, I wasn't upset."
"Some girls wouldn't be, but you're not like that, so..."
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
"No, it's really okay."
"I mean, it wasn't a problem."
I really didn't think about it.
"I mean, I did think about it, and I thought..."
maybe what you were saying wasn't so wrong.
"- No, it was really wrong."
- Why?
And I just want to let you know that if it will make you feel better...
I'm just going to make it real clear that...
I don't have any real interest in you or anything.
You know.
So they'll stop saying all that.
"That I barely even know you, which is of course true..."
"and that basically, you and I mean nothing to each other."
So that should solve the problem.
Thanks.
"It's the least I could do, you know."
Right.
- Hey.
- Hey.
What are you doing out here?
It's what I always do. I can't make it through a whole day in there.
- l know what you mean.
- Yeah.
"And now, you may spend the rest of your trip enjoying the island."
"Please feel free to make Eden into your own, personal Sandals."
Yes.
"And now, jet skis!"
"Yes, yes!"
Yes!
"Hey, hey, what's happening?"
I sure miss you guys.
I miss you so much.
And Grandpa Jim Jim let us watch Jaws!
We get to eat all the candy we want!
"Hey, guys, the jet skis are ready!"
Come on!
We're waiting on you!
Give us one second with the kids.
We'll be there in a minute.
Go ahead and start.
"Well, listen, when we get back next weekend, we'll go to Medieval Times and we'll get some big drumsticks and lots of meat."
- Yes!
"And we're gonna be doing a lot more of that fun stuff, guys, so get ready, okay?"
"I'm gonna take you to the school parking lot, we'll do some donuts."
Yeah!
Donuts!
"All right, I love you."
"Love you, too."
Here's Grandpa Jim Jim.
All right.
Enjoy your last few days.
"Hey, Dad, could you do me a favor and not give them candy every time they ask?"
You ought to be thanking me.
I'm here at this home store returning some of the stuff that you had on that house list.
"Okay, thanks so much."
Is it OK if we play a bit?
Any questions?
You can have one too if you want.
Maybe later.
Sofie's here.
But you can kiss me.
It's not just something you do with your boyfriend 'cause it's nice.
Everyone talks about it.
"Who's good in bed,   how he or she does it, ""You've got to try her"",   and you..."
It isn't natural any longer.
The way we have sex   is that we always try to push the limits and to go beyond them.
And then to go beyond new limits.
All the time.
Boys have to screw 20 or 30 chicks before they leave high school.
It's prestige for them.
"""I did it with two girls, three girls""."
Two girls and one boy.
With two guys and one girl the girl would be the important one.
That's not the idea.
We copy what we see in porn films.
That's why it gets crazier and crazier.
The more extreme and the more bodies the cooler it is.
But feelings don't come into it.
What's up?
I don't believe it!
Look at them!
"- Use the car, guys!"
- Sofie won't be pleased.
- Where is she?
- She was dancing.
- Sofie!
There you are!
What am I doing?
I'm trying to keep the little girl alive.
"I put a man up there, I told him if he had a clean shot, he should take it."
"And he missed, and we'll be lucky to get her out alive."
Pull everybody back.
And do what?
What do you suggest?
We should call CNN for him?
This little girl is everything.
She's what it's all about.
We can't afford to lose her.
( cell phone rings )
Yes.
Ray.
I am so sorry about what happened by the window.
There are some people out here who've seen too many Lethai Weapon movies.
Look up at the window.
You get me what I want.
Do it now.
RAY:
Go sit down with your mum and dad.
"You don't have to be scared, Mum."
This is all going to be all right.
A lot of things are going to happen because of this.
That's all.
But it's going to be all right.
"You better hope you're right, or you're gonna have to start praying for a little intervention from your grandfather's side of the family."
You're not gonna get it any cleaner.
He's gonna kill her.
We've gotta take him out.
"I'm not gonna be a party to any more killing, Mary."
I'm done with that.
I thought about my wife with a slime like you.
"- All right, buster..."
- Stay out of this.
Smearing you across the front pages is not enough.
Scum like you shouldn't be allowed to live.
You're gonna die.
"Stan, stop it."
Stop it.
Help him.
He'll kill him.
I can't believe it.
I'm rid of him.
It's perfect.
We just call the police and tell them it was self-defence.
Are you crazy?
That's the one thing we can't do.
But why not?
He was trying to kill you.
I'm a witness.
Shut up and listen.
Connie will take care of it.
You just go home.
Do whatever it is you'd normally do.
Just act as if nothing happened.
"When he doesn't come home tonight, call his brother, ask him where he is."
"When he says he doesn't know, act worried."
"Don't call the police until 2, maybe 3 in the morning."
Tell them anything you want to except that he came here.
You understand?
What are you gonna do with him?
He'll just disappear.
"Police will look for him a few months, then give up."
Where does it go?
When it leaves?
In the inverter.
Then turn on the inverter.
This is a joke for you!
"We are also someone's child, we lose our memory."
"You made these bombs, Right?"
Yes Papa I made it.
I have a diploma for making bombs.
Now you'll die with this bomb.
"Tell me, Where is the diamond?"
Why won't it blow?
"Papa, Bomb is here..."
And you're using the remote from there.
Come inside the range.
Should I press it while standing on the bomb.
What kind bomb is this?
Why won't it blow?
"Papa, Don't hit me."
"Don't doubt my talent, Bomb is fine."
I have a diploma.
Let me see the remote.
Here.
Battery is fitted wrong.
Now see how it blows...
"Now tell me, Where is the diamond?"
Chandi look at this diamond.
Our luck will also shine like this.
"After today, won't have to do this sales job."
We won't have to live in this car show room's wash room.
Won't have to listen to Laila Madam.
Let's runaway.
"Sir, I'm so sorry."
"No, no, no."
Don't be sorry.
You shouldn't be sorry.
"No, I aroused you."
You should be proud.
This hasn't happened to me in a long time.
"Are you attempting to have a manual stimulation from me, sir?"
Am I...
I am here on a couples retreat with my wife in the other room.
My husband Scott is just like a cat.
Scott?
My husband.
I'm trying to save my marriage here.
Look what you did to me.
"Well, that wasn't my intention, sir."
"It wasn't mine, either, and now I'm humiliated."
"Well, I'm sorry."
You told me not to think.
"Well, when I don't think, this is what happens."
You can't leave me all backed up like this.
"What do you want me to do, sir?"
I don't know.
We got to figure out a solution.
"You know, let's not take anything off the table."
Let's start brainstorming.
"We""re both in a maze together, okay?"
How do we get the cheese?
"I'm sorry, sir, but that is not gonna have a happy ending."
Give me the oil.
Go grab a smoke.
"Daddy, this is awesome!"
But you have to tell her.
You owe her and you owe me.
She doesn't give a shit.
You are so infuriating.
Is that the language you use in this house?
I just think that it would be good if you told her.
"If you don't, I will."
I'm going to see what's going on.
We thought he was dead.
- We didn't think he existed.
- You're still lying.
"No, I'm not lying."
Jørgen tried to find him in India lots of times.
He never reacted and so we assumed that he wasn't...
"- I don't have time for this, Mom."
"- Jacob was a big, immature child!"
He fucked everything with a pulse.
He was drinking himself to death.
He did drugs.
"He had grand ideas, but did nothing."
"He probably means well, but you can't trust him."
"- He wants to save everyone, but..."
- I don't care if he's fucked a goat.
I have a right to know who my father is.
- You can't manipulate people like that.
- We're not.
Fuck off and leave us alone!
Not right now.
You're far out.
What's Jørgen's reaction?
Anna?
- Should I come along?
- He's all right.
We'll run him through the wringer.
He'll wash.
- How was the ball game?
- We beat the daylights out of them.
"- You did, eh?"
What was the score?
- Sixty-three to 40.
But we only played five innings.
Fat hit a homer and we lost the ball.
And you've torn your pants again.
"Well, I was sliding into third and Muggy spiked me."
"Yeah, what did you do to him?"
I smacked him.
"You know, when I was his age, I could lick any kid in the neighborhood."
- Ouch.
- What's the matter?
- That's where he smacked me back.
That's all there is.
The fellows think I'm gonna get the job.
And I...
"Well, I'm the best man in the shop, ain't I?"
"Gee, Pop, you'll be foreman and that's about the highest job there is, ain't it?"
Heh-heh-heh.
"Well, I wouldn't say that but it's pretty high."
"Well, wait till I tell Muggy about this."
He thinks he's hot because his uncle used to be a foreman.
"Yeah, we'll get Muggy, won't we?"
"- Come on, boys, dinner's ready."
Okay.
"And if I'd have known about this, I'd have fixed us a real spread."
"Oh, don't you worry, kid."
"- Yeah, I'm fine."
I got it.
- You sure?
"Okay, I'm just gonna sleep for, like, 15 minutes, right?"
"And then you wake me up, and then we'll switch it off."
- You good?
- I'm fine.
My God.
My God!
"If we're going to be meeting sophisticated men, we need to start acting with class."
We cannot be telling people that we have bleached assholes.
He was gonna find out anyway.
"Oh, my God."
"And you, you shouldn't be drinking in a shoe store."
You shouldn't be drinking in a shoe store.
What is the matter with you?
I told you to pace yourself.
I have a drinking problem.
"Well, then, you should know how to hold your booze a little better."
I'll hold your boobs a little better.
"Oh, good one."
"Ladies, can I help you?"
Hello.
We are here for the Manolos.
- And what's your shoe size?
- 13.
We don't carry shoes that large.
Perhaps you'd like to try the Big and Tall store down the street?
You know what?
I don't like this bitch's attitude.
Did she just try and break a bottle over my head?
"No, of course she didn't."
Chad we barely go out in daylight as it is.
Come on!
I'm starting to feel like a vampire.
"- Besides, we didn't do anything wrong."
- I know.
"But Kev, I'm in this guy's sights."
"There are better options than laying low, believe me."
We can call Dan Silk.
Threaten him.
"No offense, but I don't think you could take him."
Pummeling this guy wouldn't do much for my public image.
I mean we could threaten him with legal action.
- It's true.
"- I'm a lawyer, truth is irrelevant."
I do this all the time.
"I need to make it clear, if he doesn't print a retraction, he'll face a very lengthy lawsuit."
I'll bury him in discovery and depositions.
It's Lawyering 101.
I've never seen you so...
litigious.
- Right.
- It's kind of hot.
- But no way can you call him.
- Why not?
He's not a major corporation.
He's one guy.
He's one loser.
He'll cave.
They all do.
Believe me.
No.
We just need to let it blow over.
"Eddie, this is... this is really dangerous."
"He's fucking killing me, man."
Look...
"I know you're scared, but I'm going to have the cash tomorrow, all right?"
I'm going over to this crooked lawyer.
He's got the hundred thousand.
"Look, I'm not calling for a pep talk, all right?"
I am literally over it.
"I just want to let you know I'm not letting them cut any more pieces off me, man."
What's that mean?
It means next time I'm fighting back.
I'm pretty sure I can get a knife from under the bar.
"Eddie, don't be stupid."
They'll kill you.
You understand me?
Yeah.
"Well, they're gonna have to."
"Listen, you better stick to the fucking plan."
"Otherwise, we're all dead."
I'm sticking to the plan.
I'm sticking to the fucking plan.
I just want to let you know that if for any reason you don't beat the clock...
I'm...
I'm gonna beat the clock.
I'm telling you.
That's what I'm saying.
What if you don't?
Just go.
"Just go, man."
"They're going to kill me one day anyway, Marius."
Fuck it.
It might as well be tomorrow.
"I mean, it wasn't a problem."
I really didn't think about it.
"I mean, I did think about it, and I thought..."
maybe what you were saying wasn't so wrong.
"- No, it was really wrong."
- Why?
And I just want to let you know that if it will make you feel better...
I'm just going to make it real clear that...
I don't have any real interest in you or anything.
You know.
So they'll stop saying all that.
"That I barely even know you, which is of course true..."
"and that basically, you and I mean nothing to each other."
So that should solve the problem.
Thanks.
"It's the least I could do, you know."
Right.
- Hey.
- Hey.
What are you doing out here?
It's what I always do. I can't make it through a whole day in there.
- l know what you mean.
- Yeah.
What do you need to hide from?
Your life is perfect.
I'm serious. I would give anything to have your life.
My life is so pathetic.
You have this great house.
Parents that are there.
No one bothers you at school.
"Rickie, I need to talk to you about the gun."
Don't.
I can see a UFO?
"Yes, through your window."
"You mean I can go over, there to my window, and I can look at it I can see a UFO?"
"No, but you can see it through my telescope."
"Oh, you have a telescope with you?"
"Yes, in my case."
So why don't you set it up?
I always dreamed about seeing a UFO.
"Hey, what did you say you were drinking?"
So you're dead now...shit.
And you're going to hell.
Straight from your marihuana jungles.
"Straight from your lies, your lies, your lies."
"You dropped it, fuck!"
Suits you well.
You go to hell.
Whe'll all go to hell.
I'll go to hell too.
But I know I'm damned.
"And you, never knew."
So you weren't ready?
to toll the bell.
For me it's easy.
From hell to hell I'm not dancing in marihuana jungles.
"I live in concrete mazes, stone and glass."
"Hard like my heart, sharp and clean."
No romantic illusions to changing the world.
I don't lie to myself.
That love can cure because I know I'm alone.
And you fucked that every day.
"You lived, you lied, you lied you lied."
You go to hell?
So you know...?
So now what?
"The same old story, this time I am the king and you are the queen."
Now I need to decide..
..whether I should kill him to get you...
Or shall I get you and then kill him.
He will die and you will belong to me.
It was me who made the mistake.
Spare his life.
So much concern for him?
I have come back only for you.
- There is a difference.
- What's the difference?
You took a life and he gave his life to come back.
You have to also kill to get love.
I want to change this story.
You want to change it?
How will you change it?
I don't want anyone's blood on my conscience.
Blood...
Why blood?
He can fall from a tall building.
Or..
"..he could get electrocuted, while making toast."
"I promise you, I'll give you a right to choose."
And what if you can have me?
"Then you won't kill him, right?"
Yeah?
The one who had disarmed him is now his armor.
This time he won't die because of me.
"Okay, done!"
We get engaged in three days.
Hi.
You look really nice.
"Oh, thanks."
Where do you wanna go on our first date back?
I got to be in early.
"I got curfew, you know."
"Well, we were invited over to Amy and Ricky's."
What?
"Yeah, won't that be fun?"
I've never actually been over there before.
"Yeah, me neither."
And that's because we're not really friends with Ricky and Amy.
"Yes, we are."
We've known them for years.
That's where you want to go?
I was going to take us out for dinner or something.
"That's okay, I think they're just going to order a pizza or something."
They can't really go out because of John.
Great.
It'll be fun.
I don't think it will.
They're married.
They have a baby.
"Well, don't you want to get married and have a baby someday?"
Someday.
Not today.
Not tonight.
Tonight I just want to spend some time with you.
We don't need to spend so much time alone.
It only makes us want to have sex.
"I'm always going to want to have sex with you, so I'm just going to have to wait until you tell me you want to have sex with me."
"All right, let's go."
"You basically ran into the vehicle, right?"
No no no no no!
You're not married nor do you have any children.
What a stupid question to ask.
Don't say that.
My colleague is a good doctor and you'll go and finish your ward round.
"So, you're a hawker."
What are you doing exactly?
"It's really nice of you to sit here with me, Doc."
I wanted to...
The others keep asking when the bandages will be taken off of my arm.
"It will become stiff otherwise, right?"
You got a strong hand.
Squeeze firmly!
Good.
"- You're a real man, Biberkopf."
"- I am, I am."
It was a tragic accident.
You had a fractured skull and we couldn't save your arm.
"Oh, my arm is gone."
Th-thank you for letting me know.
Well.
You don't have such a great job either.
You have to walk around telling people those things.
"Yes, that's just part of the job."
"Now, you'll be getting up soon."
- Tomorrow?
"- No, a few more days."
- But it could work tomorrow.
- No no no.
But I can't stay here much later or my business is screwed.
I need to get up really soon.
"Isn't that, uh, kind of inappropriate ?"
"I mean, given the sexual content of the lyrics."
"Well, it was the only song she knew all the words to."
"That and ""Pour Some Sugar on Me."""
Ah.
"Well, this is really fun."
"Staying up late, eating sweets, singing songs."
It's like summer camp.
Coed summer camp with really hot camp counselors.
"No offense, Gary, but this is barely entertaining me."
"Yeah, Gary, young guy in Newport, cool job... you must have a lot of fun."
Not really.
No friends ?
No girls ?
Well... there is one girl.
"Oh, well, you only need one, as long as it's a good one."
She's an amazing one.
"Well, are you guys serious ?"
Pretty serious.
"You know, thinking about taking it to the next level."
"Oh, the next level."
That's very serious.
"Yeah, you haven't asked her out yet, have you ?"
"Not yet, no."
"Well, what's the holdup ?"
"I mean, if she's as hot as she sounds."
It's not her.
It's me.
She's a great girl.
And I'm... the ice cream guy.
"Oh, what the hell..."
we have nothing better to do.
I swear.
- They won't get over it.
- Who?
The others down there.
"Father Catolle, Mr Mayor."
"Most of all, those wives of theirs."
It'll kill them!
- And then there's Bertha
- Who's she?
Someone I thought of as queen of the village.
"But now, comparing her to you she's a cow."
"I like you a lot, Goubi."
Do you...
"Do you think the schoolkids will call me ""Mr Goubi""?"
"They'd better, or they'll cop it!"
But then there's the others.
The grown-ups.
They all know I'm an imbecile.
Even if I have a wife and a car I'll always be one.
It's true...
"Once the die is cast, that's it."
And then there's something else.
You're all that I think about.
I can't help it.
"One day, thinking about you too much... is going to make my head explode."
Because of you.
I'm used to people making fun of me.
"But they'll talk about YOU, because of ME and I'd hate that."
You'll have your own land and money in the bank...
So you'll never stop people talking behind your back.
The main thing is that they're silent when you turn around!
So you came to ask me permission to marry La Fleur.
I always admired that.
"You'd walk into a burning building, save your worst enemy."
"Time to save yourself now, Dad."
Okay?
Walk into the light.
It's okay.
Don't worry about us.
We're gonna be fine.
You don't have to suffer.
You did your job.
"Take care of yourself, Pop."
I love you.
Walk into the light.
Bye.
So you know if your dad could talk right now he'd tell you you were acting like a big pussy?
"Thanks, Mom."
- I love you.
- Love you too.
"You did good, man."
"No matter what happens, you'll know you did right by your dad."
"I don't even know if he could hear me, but I guess it needed to be said, right?"
"Johnny, I'm so proud of you."
"Being able to cry in front of your dad like that, that's huge."
Who told you I cried?
Hank.
"Your mom ratted you out, bro."
She was taking prop bets on whether or not you'd cry.
She lost big on that one.
You got a big mouth.
I'm serious.
"I really do think that this is a big step for you, Johnny."
Life is so much richer when you allow yourself to tap into some vulnerability.
What ?
"Oh, no !"
A rabbit ?
"I found him in the garage, and he was limping."
Let me see.
Careful.
"Baby, come here."
Let me see.
"You know, he seems like he's okay."
Maybe it's just a sprain.
"No, I can't take a chance, okay ?"
I have to go get him help.
"Summer, you can't."
It's too dangerous.
"I cannot wait here any longer, okay ?"
I have a missing boyfriend and a sick rabbit.
I cannot listen to any more of your mother's whining.
"Okay, I'll go with you."
We'll brave the zombies together.
"Mom, we're going to need to take Pancakes to the hospital."
Wait.
"This carrion gets help, but not me ?"
"We don't have a car, you can't walk."
There is no way to get you there.
"Taylor, I risked my life and hoofed it all the way from Emerald Bay, and you're just going to leave me here to rot ?"
"I have an idea, but I don't think you're going to like it."
This is not okay with me.
"Well, I told you you wouldn't like it."
"Mom, it's not that far to the hospital, and it's kind of this or nothing."
"Fine, but I'm not holding the rabbit... unless you promise I can make a vest out of him."
Okay.
I'll carry Pancakes.
We'll find a way.
Just as soon as he has the company making money again.
Wait a minute.
John!
"Oh, hello, my dear."
And Harold.
Nice to see you again.
"How are you, John?"
All I know is what my psychiatrist tells me.
He says you're entirely well.
And it's going to be wonderful to have you home.
"Isn't it, Harold?"
It's the best news I've heard in months.
"Well, all packed, I see."
"You know, I'm beginning to think that you never liked this place."
"It's not so bad after you get used to it, Doc."
But you say I'm all right now and my wife wants me home.
"Well, you take care of yourself."
"I don't want to see you back here again, except as a visitor."
"I'll see that he never comes back, Doctor."
"Shall we go, dear?"
"John, if you'll sign this we'll spring you."
"Anything you say, Warden."
That's a fine way to talk.
"Here, I'll take those."
"Oh, I forgot this."
"Well, I think that's everything."
"Mrs. Brown, I'm sorry."
"Your husband won't be able to go with you just now, after all."
I don't understand.
He is not able to leave here now.
But he's completely sane.
I know I can.
I can stop this.
"No one can stop it, John."
Listen to me.
Planes are going to crash.
Earthquakes are going to happen.
People you know and love are going to die... and no matter what that voice tells you... there's nothing you can do about it.
It's two years to the day.
He told me that she's goi ng to call.
He said that Mary's going to call.
He's lying.
Whoever calls maysound like her... but it's not gonna be her.
I don't know what happens to us after we die... but I'll bet you wherever Mary is now... she's nowhere near Indrid Cold.
What if it is her?
"She's dead, John."
The only important question now is how do you want to remember her?
I miss her so much.
I know you do.
Of course you do.
"But, John, listen... you can miss her here just as easily as there."
"Even more easily because there, you're all alone."
And that's just no way to be.
You do whatever you need to do... and I'll understand.
"But here, we have dinner at 6:00... and we open presents at 8:00."
And we hope we see you.
Okay?
"Bye,John."
WJMP time is 5:51 on this chilly Christmas Eve.
Come on.
- You know what's going on down there?
- Some problem with the traffic lights.
Shit.
Sandra.
Are you leaving me?
"That would be easy for you, wouldn't it?"
"You get to be the good guy, and your kooky wife leaves you for some guy she met at est."
"[Sighs] No, I'm not gonna leave you, Stan."
But I'm not gonna sit around and wait for you to get the courage to leave me.
Mr. Jennings.
Can I help you?
"As a matter of fact, Tim, yes, you can."
"- Have a seat, please."
- I won't be staying long.
What is it you want?
I want you to stay away from my daughter.
You want her to stop coming to church?
That's right.
That's between you and Paige.
"Well, I..."
I think you can help with that... and I think you will help with that.
"I can't turn Paige away from the church, Mr. Jennings."
It's a sanctuary.
I can't turn anyone away.
[Chuckling] That's the whole point of this place.
Is something wrong?
You took $600 from her.
I thought you knew about that.
We never would have accepted it if we thought you didn't approve.
I-I'll write you a check right now if you want.
But... that's not why you're here.
"No, it's not."
"Are you really gonna beat me up, Mr. Jennings?"
For $600?
For your daughter?
"Dropped out freshman year, but still shows up to our reunion."
What kind of loser would do that ?
We're going to find out.
"I'm serious, guys."
You're making a mistake.
"No, we're not."
"Get your hands out, Mr. Winslet."
What ?
"You didn't go to the reunion to sell insurance, did you ?"
"Yes, I did."
I told you before.
I got blood smeared.
There was smeared blood on the floor where Patrick was killed.
How much you want to bet that's our victim's blood ?
"Puts you at the scene, Dan."
Do you care to talk about that ?
I should have been part of that class.
It's all his fault.
"Freshman year, locker room."
Dansy the pansy.
Shouldn't have told Coach I blew off practice.
That'll keep you from talking !
Yeah !
Good night !
You want to know how long I was in the hospital ?
How long it took them to get that tape off me ?
Skin grafts.
I can't take off my shirt in front of anyone.
Not that I even have anyone.
- Do you blame Patrick for the life you have ?
- No.
For taking the life I could have had.
Tell him to go the fuck away!
That's what she says.
I just want to talk to you for a minute!
"Tell him, no, he's an asshole."
"That, too."
Don't even start.
I didn't say anything yet.
I know what you're gonna say.
"No, you don't."
Bullshit.
"First, you'll deny it."
Then you'll lie about it.
"Then you'll say you're sorry and swear it'll never, ever, ever happen again."
Then it happens again.
You're making my sauce?
I'm making sauce.
Put the butter in yet?
"No, 'cause it's not your sauce."
It's better with the butter.
I'm not putting your fucking butter in.
"Hey, I get it."
You're mad.
But don't blame the butter.
"Look, this whole D.U.I. thing is bullshit."
You were arrested for driving drunk with our kids in the car.
"Well, when you say it like that, yeah, it sounds terrible."
I had a couple glasses of champagne.
You tell me you never had a few drinks and then drove the kids?
I know you did.
You just never got caught.
"Yeah, well, not anymore."
I haven't had a drink in six weeks.
"Do us a favor, please?"
Could you turn the stage lights on again?
It's a child's dream.
"Turn the lights on, now!"
Do as she says.
We won't go at it again!
Not you.
You performed... you came.
I got what I could for you.
Did you like my acting?
I could smash...
Why did you tell me you kissed the earth I walk on?
You have to kill me!
"I am so tired, to rest, to rest!"
I am a seagull!
"No, that's not it."
I am an actress.
That's it!
He's there too.
Yes.
But that's nothing.
"He didn't believe in theater, he always used to mock my dreams, and I ended up not believing in them either, I lost my courage!"
"And then the turmoils of love, the jealousy, the constant fear for my little one."
"I was becoming petty, insignificant, my acting was stupid!"
"I didn't know what to do with my hands, didn't know how to stand!"
I couldn't control my voice!
You don't know what it feels like!
She's better than me.
Learn to carry your cross and keep your faith
"I have the faith, and I suffer."
It's ridiculous.
Chicks like this...
We got here early.
I know about you and the girl.
"We know, okay?"
"Now we can offer you two a way out, a way through."
"And if you do what we say, if you help us, we won't have to hurt her."
There's no need for violence.
Violence is what got us all in this place to begin with.
This is the end of violence for us.
This is a new beginning.
It's a partnership.
And it starts by you getting her to open that door.
Fuck you.
"Oh, shit."
Your leg.
"Oh, my God."
I don't even feel anything.
That's usually a bad sign.
You always know what to say to a girl.
Up.
"You have training in this kind of a thing, right?"
What?
- Field surgery?
Dressing wounds?
- Yeah.
"I mean, it's not my area of expertise but I know a little bit."
Okay.
Is all this blood normal?
"Well, you have a piece of truck in your leg."
No way is a joke gonna make me feel more comfortable in your ability to not kill me right now.
Grit your teeth.
Looks like we missed the artery.
"But it's gonna be okay, right?"
"- Well, thank you for your time."
- You're leaving and she's coming?
I don't think she came to talk to me.
- I didn't expect her to come today.
- Me neither.
- Are you okay?
- Yes.
He had to hurry to the bank.
- Hi.
Good to see you.
"- Hi, Anna."
I didn't think you were coming today.
Why didn't you tell me?
Why haven't you told me yourself?
Why do you keep lying to me?
"Sorry, Anna..."
I didn't want to make you sad.
Did you think I wouldn't be sad if you just died one day?
- No...
- What?
I didn't want you to see me as a dead man before I was.
I wanted us to be together as much as possible before anyone knew.
"If I knew you were dying, I wouldn't spend my time doing other stuff."
And I want you to tell me these things.
I want you to tell me.
"Anna, you mustn't cry now."
"It will hurt   but it will pass, just like everything else."
And now Jacob will be with you.
I don't care about Jacob.
You're my father and you didn't tell me you're dying.
I don't want anyone but you.
"If you don't tell me you're dying, I can't say the things I want to say."
"Oh,yeah,I am,but Petty's not."
Stay there.He could still show up.
Where the hell are you?
"Till you hear back from me,do not move."
Petty.
- You know me?
- A friend of mine did.
Give me your hands.
You probably won't want to move now.
Now give me your gun and your phone.
I've never been on a stakeout before.
This isn't a stakeout.It's a waste of time.
Hauser say why he thought Petty was coming here?
"Well,transparency isn't one of Hauser's strong suits."
I just pictured him in a transparent suit.
It's pretty gross.
"Drop the knife.Get on the ground,face down."
You with the guy in the suit?
You are.
Aren't you just a peach?
There you go.
Where is he?
How about we just cut the cop to psychopath chitchat and you tell me what you want?
I want my bombs back.
The one in the bags or the one in the cemetery?
Your friend is dead.
What do you want?
I want to know what happened to me.
A week ago I went to sleep a stone's throw from where we're standing now.
"The next thing I know,it's what,2012?"
And I wake up lying on the floor of a tomb.
"Tell me how that's possible,and I'Il tell you anything you want to know."
"""...that killed the rat."""
And then I have to go all the way to Denmark to shake somebody's hand.
He'll take a photo of me and show all his rich friends he's done good.
This is not up for discussion.
- I have to think about it.
"- No, you won't think about it."
"You will go, wear a suit, get a haircut, behave nice and smile."
"Please, Jacob."
You know as well as I do that this is our last chance.
Otherwise we'll have to close down.
Then these children will have nowhere to go.
They'll be on the streets.
Please.
You owe the children that much.
This is our last chance.
Are there only rich people where you are going?
- Yes.
- No one is poor?
- No.
Some have more than others.
"- If I was rich, I'd be happy."
"- I know, but people there are idiots."
"- You hate all the rich, Mr. Jacob."
Is it because the houses are far apart that people are far apart?
"I'll tell you all about it when I get back, right?"
What's wrong?
Pramod?
You're not coming back.
I know it.
I promise that I'll be back for your birthday.
I told you so.
"Pramod, come on."
"Now, I need you to get up slowly, and you'll go to that chair, with your hands behind your back, and sit down."
Can you do that for me?
You don't have to say anything.
Just nod if you're cool.
I just need you... on that chair.
"You brought this... on yourselves, guys."
But it can all be over very soon.
I just need one of you to own up to sending the postcard...
- and then we're all done here.
- We don't know who sent the postcard.
"- Please, we don't know."
- He doesn't care if we know or not.
He just wants to screw with us.
- Don't you?
- You got a few moments to talk it over.
I'll be outside.
But I'll be watching.
Luke... with me.
"Did you send the postcard, Luke?"
"No way, man."
I hardly knew your brother.
No offence.
"I'm just a ""party guy"", I bring the drugs and mix the drinks."
"Shallow as fluck, seriously."
"They should be thanking you, Luke."
"If you hadn't have helped out, things might have got a bit more... messy."
You're a good man.
This business with the postcard.
"I don't know, maybe you should just..."
- let it go.
"- I can't do that, mate."
I need answers.
"I provide the supplies, you provide the service."
"If we're gonna be partners, we need to share the risk."
Same deal I had with Des.
So you need to know how to do this.
I know how to do it.
Properly.
Like a doctor.
How about if I inject you?
Whole purpose is for me to show you.
You can talk me through it.
"First, you have to find a good vein."
Press up and down gently.
Mm-hmm.
This will expand the vein and make it easier to see.
Just like people.
You apply enough pressure and they show what they really are.
Now take the syringe.
Insert the needle.
Pull back slightly to show a bit of blood.
That's good.
You want a slow and steady release.
"Too fast, you'll send the body into shock."
"You always remember your first time, right?"
We should celebrate... our partnership.
Want a drink?
Can I use your bathroom?
"Yeah, just down the hall."
Let me get this straight.
Your dealer is behind this whole thing.
That's right.
Grady Burgess.
Because you owe him money.
I had to finish high school first.
Before I go into modelling.
Why not just do it anyway?
"Yes, but unless mum signs the contract Unique can't hire me."
She's been in such a mood since dad went off with her best friend.
Unique will want you anyway.
You're so beautiful.
You are so sweet.
You are the most beautiful girl I have ever met.
I've been in love with you since the first time I saw you.
"I love you, too."
- I'II go with you.
- Do you mean it?
You make me feel I've come home.
With you I'd be able to get my life sorted.
- You think?
- I know I do.
In New York we'd have our own place   and make our own dough.
And start a family when we were ready.
"No fucked-up parents, no fucked-up friends."
No dope.
- Just us.
- But if mum says no we can't go.
No.
But you are a clever girl.
You'll get her to change her mind.
So your mum says you can't be a model till after high school?
What a bummer!
We were going to come and see you in New York!
"I've just bought a new suitcase, too."
- You look a bit better now.
- Philip's arrived.
- Yeah.
Don't you think?
"I mean, honestly, are you ever angry at him?"
No.
Really?
You're not angry at him?
"Well, I did get angry sometimes, but not... but just..."
I just felt...
I don't know.
"Kind of a tragedy that he didn't work it out, isn't it?"
"You know, it seems almost too much he was on the way home to maybe come live with us."
- Yes.
- Who knows?
- You still believe that?
- I do believe it.
Do you think he crossed off his passport on his way home to...
to show something?
"Yes, to indicate... yes."
Why else would he have done it?
Why else would he have done that?
Can you give me an explanation?
It's a good myth to have.
I don't think it's a myth.
I don't think it's a myth at all.
"I mean, I have very strong conviction about that, because I know what... what Lou said to me, you know, when we... when we parted."
What did he say?
He said he would do it.
"I mean, he said..."
I said that I can't...
"I can't bear it any longer, and you have to... you have to do something, and you have to live with us."
And he said he would.
- Really?
Aren't all newspapermen?
That's a myth.
We're the most sentimental slobs in the world.
- The softest touches there are.
- Prove it.
All right.
When do I start?
All I want is a chance to show what I can do.
"Write something up this week, I'll run it Friday."
"Thank you, Mr. Bushwell."
I'll start right away.
- I'll dig up a story you'll never forget.
- I don't doubt it.
"Just remember, there's no such thing as a cheap lawsuit."
Hold on.
We haven't discussed pay.
You don't have to.
I'll do it for experience.
The first thing experience teaches us is to get paid.
Five dollars a column to start.
More later.
That's more... .
I wouldn't want these stories to fall into the wrong hands.
"Thanks, Seth."
"There's no question, the tests confirm that you're pregnant, Selena."
I'd say about three months.
- Who's the father?
- I won't tell you.
"Now, what kind of rot is that?"
You're not the first girl in the world who had to get married.
"Or in this town, for that matter."
Who's the father?
You stole millions but I see you in a toddy shop.
Foreign liquor is boring.
Local toddy is too good.
You ruined all the money.
Moreover they were dollars not rupees.
What if I lose?
"Boss, you must live long."
You're the king who gave us party on losing.
When will you lose again?
Winners have the say.
We are losers and they are winners.
Winner boss...
When will you win?
"When you win, we will party."
You are right.
You're trying to cover up your defeat very well.
Cover up?
I don't know that.
Only now I knew there is lot of kick in losing.
Yes boss.
Every time I win and I've lost the kick in winning.
I lost for the first time in my life.
Now I know the kick in losing.
I'll pay the bill.
"When we lose, we should never worry."
You must celebrate it.
"When a man understand this, no loser will cry on losing."
Will party all the time.
Drinks all the time.
That includes you too.
Superb!
I mean your philosophy.
"""Why are you still watching this?"" ""You missed a lot of other stuff."
"He hates women."""
I looked at one of those fake asses for about five...
"Shut up, guys."
Not now.
Not this close to the end.
Don't you leave me.
Lock those doors.
They are locked?
So all the doors are locked.
I looked at one of those things for five minutes.
"I was like, ""You know what?"
"If no one was ever gonna know, then, yeah, I'II have sex with it."
"I'm gonna jerk off anyway."" Fellas, am I right?"
The shittiest choreographed ending.
All right.
Just me.
Just me.
"I thought we'd all stand up and get into it, but..."
"Women, I don't know if you know this about men... but when we're in our 20s and our brain is, ""Jerk off right now,"" we're like, ""You got it."
"You got it."""
"When we're in our 30s and our brain is, ""Jerk off right now,"""
"I promise you, all of us are like,"
"""When the fuck does this stop?"
I don't wanna do this shit anymore.
It's been 20 goddamn years.
I haven't liked it for ten.
I just kept doing it 'cause I thought I'd die.
"Stay away from me... and stay away from my family."""
"My question is, if you buy one of those fake asses... where do you even keep that?"
"""I keep mine under the bed."""
"Do you, you lunatic?"
Is my husband with you?
Have you found him?
You're the only one we've found so far.
What about your husband?
I don't know.
We ran into trouble... and we lost most of our provisions crossing the river.
"The ice broke, and - and then some of our dogs died."
Two days ago my husband went out to look for food... and he hasn't come back.
Do you think he's dead?
That's a pretty good guess.
What are we gonna do with her?
What can you do?
Take her to Dawson and leave her.
"You're forgetting one thing, pal."
- Yeah?
- She and her old man was looking for the same thing we are.
And they had the map - the original one.
"You'll find my husband for me, won't you?"
There's nothing we can do.
We're a thousand miles from nowhere.
"Either the cold got him, or the wolves."
- Get on the sled.
We're taking you to Dawson.
- But you gotta help me find him.
He isn't dead.
I
- I don't believe that.
"Hey, listen, lady, in this country when a guy is gone for two days, he's gone."
I refuse to go until I definitely know about my husband.
"If you don't wanna stay and look for him, you can go without me."
No!
No!
Who is he?
- It doesn't matter who he is.
What are you gonna do -- go arrest him?
Sandra.
Sandra.
Are you leaving me?
"That would be easy for you, wouldn't it?"
"You get to be the good guy, and your kooky wife leaves you for some guy she met at EST."
"No, I'm not gonna leave you, Stan, but I'm not gonna sit around and wait for you to get the courage to leave me."
Mr. Jennings.
Can I help you?
"As a matter of fact, Tim, yes, you can."
"Have a seat, please."
I won't be staying long.
What is it you want?
I want you to stay away from my daughter.
You want her to stop coming to church?
That's right.
That's between you and Paige.
"Well, I..."
"I think you can help with that, and I think you will help with that."
"I can't turn Paige away from the church, Mr. Jennings."
It's a sanctuary.
I can't turn anyone away.
That's the whole point of this place.
Is something wrong?
You took $600 from her.
I thought you knew about that.
We never would have accepted it if we thought you didn't approve.
"I-I'll write you a check right now if you want, but... that's not why you're here."
"No, it's not."
"Are you really gonna beat me up, Mr. Jennings?"
Tomorrow night.
He didn't tell me that when I spoke to him.
"Well, he got hung up."
And he didn't know he was going to get hung up when he talked to you on the phone.
(SIGHING)
"Well, we'll wait for him."
"We can't do that, we can't wait, we got to go."
No.
We'll wait till tomorrow.
We'll stay here.
"Pluto, I don't think that's such a good idea."
"We don't have much room, and, uh... (CRACKING KNUCKLES)"
"Yeah, man."
"What the fuck, man."
"You know, you can, uh, you can have my room."
I've slept on the couch before.
"Fuck you, Beaver."
I'm not moving.
Give me the phone.
"I swear to God, sometimes I don't think you got a fucking brain in your head."
"Ray, I'm going to Star City."
"The only reason why I got involved in this shit was because you promised me we'd get some money, that I could go home and see my people."
"Yeah, well, that's before all this shit happened, wasn't it?"
It's about time we got where we're going.
I don't see what the problem is.
All y'all got to do is come through and pick me up.
It's on the way.
RAY:
"You know goddamn well that Pluto's not going to do that, don't you?"
You heard what the man said.
I think it's a good idea.
"If she goes ahead of us, it will be safer to travel."
Suits you well.
Shit!
"Ok, you wanna see an alien craft?"
You will see it.
Look.
"You know I always dreamt to fuck a dead man, that's my chance."
You're crazy.
Sure I'm baby.
"That's why you like me, so let's fuck him."
-Don't you touch him.
-You want any?
So you fucked twice today already.
Don't do it!
"You don't like it baby, you don't have to watch."
Crazy!
Don't do it.
"Don't get moral with me, whore, you had to fuck him didn't you?"
I told you not to fuck him.
This is my place I do what I want here.
You can fuck any petty asshole who gives you a chance.
You god damn whore!
Don't you call me that you low-class freaking monster!
Monster!
I'm a monster?
"You let these guys walk on your bones, bitch!"
"and you're gonna kill me with syphylis one day, you dirty cunt."
Don't talk to me like that.
"Your mother was nuts, your father was a bum."
You'll never go anywhere but to the Bowery you belong with the bums.
You shut your mouth or I'll cut you baby.
And nobody will fuck your ugly cunt.
Why did you have to do that to him?
No.
"No, I couldn't."
"Saturday, I gotta work."
"Sunday, I'm going to a picnic."
"Well, no, I couldn't take you."
It's not exactly a picnic.
Some fellas and I are going fishing.
"Yeah, I'll call you up sometime."
Goodbye.
I see by the paper they're having a sale of vacuum cleaners down at the fair.
I think I'll get you one.
Plenty of time for that.
When will you know about the job for sure?
I ought to hear from the super tomorrow.
"After I get the vacuum, I'm gonna get you a new coat."
I think maybe we can doll this house up a little bit.
Maybe we can get rid of that heap and get us a real car.
Do you think we should?
The old car runs all right.
"I got the swellest wife and kid in the world, ain't I?"
And the best ain't none too good for them.
"That's swell of you, honey, but we gotta pay the folks that helped us when you were out of work."
"- Oh, we'll clean that up in no time."
- Ha-ha.
"- Yeah, I think maybe we ought to get some new dishes too."
"Hey, Pop, come on."
You're missing out on Speed Foster.
What's he doing?
Still hanging on by his teeth?
"Yeah, but he's in terrible danger."
"Go ahead, darling."
Hang on by your teeth and I'll hang on to the dishes.
"Yeah, well, maybe he's better off on his own, anyways."
What does that mean?
"Okay, if we find him, then what?"
"Then, if he's very lucky he gets to go back with his mom?"
"I would run away, too."
"Promise me right now that you never do that, that you'd never run away, no matter how bad things may seem."
Your mother and I will always be there.
"Okay, Dad, please, take it down a notch."
"The minute you were born, I knew that I would never take another easy breath again without knowing you were safe."
So I'm like asthma?
I'm warning you.
You run away...
I'm coming with you.
I guess we can keep looking.
This song reminds me of you.
I thought you were with Luke.
I was.
I don't know why I'm here.
I just wanted to see you.
I mean...you're leaving tomorrow and...what if I never... we never...
Maybe I could spend the night.
Just to hang out.
You can't stay.
"If you stay, if you spend the night, I..."
I don't know that I could leave.
"Well, then don't."
"Yeah, you go back to school in the fall and I'll just what--hang around here?"
Hiding like some ghost?
Till the cops find me and I have to disappear again?
We're from different worlds.
That's not true.
I'm not like you.

"Professor, I want to make a request."
Request.

My parents weren't even married.
What's the connection between marriage and birth?
"City, Mumbai."
I mean then it was Bombay.

Go now.
It'd be bad if they returned
Please
I'll cope with you some other day
I don't know what you're up to.
Anyway， you must pay
How much? $200，000?
No， make it $20，000
Thank you， boss
Where's he?
Landal， where have you been?
The Seven-Eleven， to buy shampoo
Why are you wet through?
I was pouring at Seven-Eleven
Why's your head covered with suds?
I had a shampoo because it's wet
This is the detergent， not the shampoo
I took the wrong thing.
I must go back and change it
Who are you looking for?
She's coming up
Miss， it's late.
Come some other day
You've put on my underpants
You must be crazy
Now I've got the proof
Take them off now
Okay
These are yours.
Take them back
ln fact， it was my fault
Now we're literally playing with power.
"Come on, jump."
Jump!
"Come on, Mario, jump!"
"God, how do I jump?"
"Come on, jump!"
Ass!
"Oh, jump is over here."
"Alright, here we go."
"Get the mushroom, oh-"
"Aw, now that's assy."
"Yeah, I know I use the word ""ass"" a lot."
I guess you can say I'm an assaholic.
Let's try Kung Fu.
"Yeah, I'm honestly surprised."
This thing kinda works.
"Looking at the instructions, each game has a specific setup and a switch combination."
Kinda like the codes with the Power Glove.
"Punch-Out!! uses an upright position and a ""Power Bar""."
"Everything's always ""power""."
"What's so ""power"" about it?"
"It's only a plastic bar, and why do you need it?"
"Yeah, now that's what I'm talkin' about!"
This actually works!
I'm punching somebody with the U-Force!
"Oh, watch out, oh-"
"Get up, get up, get up!"
Alright.
Alright.
One more game.
I can't believe we gotta touch this one again.
Top Gun has an option of using this weird joystick thing.
"I mean, no one really knows."
TED LEO:
Ryan Gosling and James Franco.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"Yeah, I'm done with Ryan Gosling."
"I'm done with like, girls being like, isn't it interesting that I have a crush on Ryan Gosling?"
Because I'd kill him just to get those girls to shut up.
"And then James Franco, why not?"
It would be a project.
It would be an art project.
BETH HOYT:
Absolutely.
"That's the way he would see it, too."
"Not that [INAUDlBLE] it's just, you know, his view on everything, right?"
It's all art.
TED LEO:
"He's an indicator for me of how old I am, because I really don't know who, like--"
JULlE KLAUSNER:
You don't get him?
TED LEO:
"No, I just don't know, I don't know, I don't think I've seen anything he's been in."
You know what I mean?
"Like, it's that kind of, I feel like it's, I'm on some other side of some line."
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"Ryan Gosling, or James Franco?"
TED LEO:
James Franco.
BETH HOYT:
You will.
"He's like all the little, a bunch of things."
JULlE KLAUSNER:
He'll show up at your house one day.
You go to the hospital everyday?
"So, everyday you're with Baek Seung Jo?"
"Because Mother leaves during the day, it's just us two."
If only Baek Seung Jo's little brother would be hospitalized a little longer.
"Hey, what are you saying..."
No?
What no
"We can see everything, Oh Ha Ni!"
What are you saying?
You're not allowed to fool around with the wheelchairs!
How do you read this?
How much is it?
"Yes, what does it mean?"
How much is this?
Correct.
"Hey guys, let's eat a snack."

Happy Birthday to you!
Happy Birthday!
"No Ri, happy birthday!"

Thank you.

Okay.

Which one do you think will Phil like better?
Hmm?
Which one do you think?
That one?
Is that one the best?
Masood:
Here is the market in the old city.
"Most foreigners think that it is dangerous to walk around the streets of Kabul, but as you can see, there is no danger... for us, anyway."

This has got to stop.
Hush!
I shwear that girl looks like Her Grace.
Huh?
Is Sulhi in?
"I really AM drunk, I'm seeing things."
She looks just like Dong Yi in the old days.
"Um, I think it's her."
Huh?
It IS her.
But why's she here?
Good question...
What brings you here?
And dressed like this?
I know this is sudden... but I desperately need some information.
About the capital murders?
I've been concerned about them myself.
There's talk that it's the Sword Guild.
That's why I'm here.
To find out who's behind these murders... and if they're the same people that framed the guild before.
The ghetto?
Yes.
"Your father lived there, so the guild's orders came from there."
Are you mental?!
James:
The LHC master power's down there.

"No, but we can't..."

So that's it?!
The worlds largest machine has an on/off switch?
Kate:
What is your problem?!
James:
"Look, this is just a relay."
There's six of them.
If one of them trips the others go off automatically.
Amy:
I hope somebody noticed that.
Connor:
There's nobody around to notice it.
No one will be in until tomorrow.

He's little close in our relations.
But the boy is really nice.
"Even if we keep refusing the alliances, Jackie... ...will not come out of the jail for 2 years."
And it's difficult for us to let Radha... ...remain unmarried for 2 more years.
Its an absolutely lost case.

Where did this come from?
This is a real baby elephant.
I'm going to make it my pet.
Stop it!
It's prohibited to capture real animals.
"Don't you dare to stop me, stupid robot!"
I'm sure it came from some hunting prohibited area nearby.
"This is a safari park made only with robots, right?"
It's his fault for coming here.
Why can't I hunt it?

Who permitted you to do so?
Couldn't you find any other tree for burning Holi?
I'll not spare you people today!
Let my son come home.
Your son.
You call the delicate darling your son.
And what will he do?
Will he stick the branches back to the tree?
Isn't it?
He's very strong.
- I see.
He can uproot the entire tree and plant it back in his house.
I will shoot you today..
Why shoot us?

And call the firm and tell them about this scandal.
Güney Bey has a guest.
Simay Canay.
He is mentally challenged.
He's obsessed.
You heard him.
How he threatened me.
He is very determined to get me in trouble.
Güney Bey...
You have a guest waiting at the reception.
- Simay Canay...
- No way.
Tell them to send her away.
How many times I have to tell you not to let that woman in this building?
You still asking?
He doesn't want to see her.
Güney Bey isn't in the company.
His car is here though.
This is what they told me.
I was going to give him something that belongs to him.
"Anyway, as he wishes."

Hi!
Did you get home safely?
Yesterday?
"Ah yes, of course!"
I did get home safely.
I knew you would be safe because of Kyung Sunbae.
"But, it seems like you did worry about me."
"Anyways, it was fun."
It was like we were shooting a movie.
"""Gangsters and Hae Rin"""
I'm glad that you got home safely.
Let's go inside.
Look at this.
"Wonderful perfection, a goddess."
You sure did take a lot of pictures.
"Wow, look at this."
"She looks pretty, right?"
"So, what happened yesterday?"
"You did have a date, right?"
What date?
We just ate and left right after.
"Ah, I should have paid for the food."
"Ah, what is that?!"
How could you when you had the perfect chance?!
You should have confessed.
Confession...
I did plan on doing it.
"President, the ticket is ready."
Call Kang Hwi immediately!
He is in the practice room now.

"That is called Hapki Dance, isn't it good?"
Sit down.
"Ah, yes."
"As I was sleeping yesterday, I suddenly had an inspiration!"
"So, I came early because I wanted to complete the choreography."

That is what I want to ask you!
Hey!

Hello!
Where is Suraj?
- He is at a military hospital.
Hospital!
There's no cause for worry.
He's perfectly all right.
A bullet hit his shoulder and now it's out.
He'll be dancing within a week.
I told you that nothing would happen to Suraj.
God heard my prayers.
This means that our hero is perfectly all right.
He is no ordinary hero.
His plane caught fire and it crashed.
He landed with his parachute right in the midst of the enemy.
He was 20 miles away from our side... ... and he came back avoiding the shower of bullets.
Can we meet Suraj?
The visiting hours are from 4 to 6.
You can meet him then.
Goodbye!
"Come, aunty."
This is Suraj's room.
You can go in.
"Hello, aunty!"
Are you all right?
- Perfect!
I want to catch one there.
Great work.

This is Washington D.C.
After a little break some members will get ready.
I heard Him Chan and Jong Up will be filming first.
I didn't want to waste time in the hotel.
I heard the set is near here so I came out to skateboard.
I like it here so much.
"Hi, I'm Him Chan."
"""Hurricane"" MV is over."
We were filming for a real long time.
There were many different places we went to.
"And today, we came over to Washington D.C."
"As soon as we got here, Jong Up and I had to film for the ""Coffee Shop"" MV."
So we're out here and it's pretty nice.
Zelo is here too.
Zelo seems to like America a lot.
Look at him.
But I'm a little worried about something.
L.A. and San Francisco were very natural and free cities.
Washington D.C. seems like a noble place.
I'm worried that Zelo will get scolded.
We're at the MV shooting set.
Wish us luck.
Goodbye.
We're heading to New York now.
New York is the final destination.
We'll try our best in NY too and head back safely.

We'll go to Korea from JFK.
Perhaps you've got no family.
That's why you all have become emotionless.
When you didn't love anyone how will you know about it?
I feel suffocation over here.
I feel I'm jailed.

And you've got no idea about music.
And you...
"Don't worry, baby."
We're with you.
It's just a matter of few days.
Moment the risk of goons is reduced we'll drop you home.
You'd never feel that.
Perhaps you've got no family.

"Don't get disheartened, my child."
I've told Pundit to fix a date for your marriage with Radha.
Father!
You are God!
You are a great man.
And I'm a thief!
"- Quick, everyone, hurry!"
Put them on!
- Whose slippers are these?
- Mine!
"- Hey, who's missing?"
- How should I know?
- He got away.
- Lost one.

And that's me.
That's my name -- Kostya Inochkin.
I ran away with the locals to the island.
I'm a very good swimmer.

"I, too, spent summers in camps."
We had it tough back then.
Had to sleep in makeshift shelters...
Cook on open fire.
Had to fetch our own water.
And do our own laundry.
"In other words, none of the comforts of life whatsoever."
And now?
Look around.
Oh!
"How sweet, Tanya."
Red heart shaped box.
Very nice.
"Bunty, will you marry me?"
That's your favourite Question.
"Right, Tanya?"
You keep giving me a fright by asking this question again and again.
What's there to be afraid of?
"And if I wanted to frighten you.. ..I would've said ""Please marry me, I'm pregnant with your child""."
That would've been better.
Less scary.
Listen Sweetie.
If you want we can move in together.
Live-in is ok.
We can be partners.
But no Mister and Misses.
And no marriage.
I've promised grandpa.. ..that I'll get married.
And that too only to you.
"Then you can't fulfill your promise in this lifetime, Tanya."
"Bunty, marriage is an institution."
"A mental institution, Tanya."
And the living examples are my parents.
"Marriage is the end of love, Tanya.. - Bunty.."
You will know what I am talking about.. ..once you meet my parents.

"-Anthony, not all French men are gay."
That sounds a little bit racist.
"-Okay, well, earlier today, he was doing some really questionable things."
"This is the living room, and I'll show you--"
Why are you holding my hand?
-Why would I not?
-Not gay!
-What?
-Not gay!
-What are you doing?
-Looking at gay porn.
"-Not g-- okay, that might be a little gay."
"-Anthony, you can't be so racist."
Just because his culture is different it doesn't mean you can spread lies about his sexual orientation.
-He was looking at gay porn.
-And who doesn't from time to time?
-True.
"-Dude, I gotta go."
I've been looking for French fries for the past five hours and I can't find them anywhere.
-(Pierre) I want to be... [knock on door]
"-(Anthony) Hey Pierre, are these your friends?"
They look like Richard Simmons.
"-You idiot, that's the Italian mafia."
-What the hell are they doing here?
-I have a lot of gambling debt.
I just can't say no to naked Twister.
"-Okay, it's time to eat s--t and die, sillies!"
-Yeah!
"You've messed with the wrong Italians, Pierre."
-I'm so scared right now.
Hold me.
-What?
"No Ri,"
"Eun Jo, I'm fine."
I'm going to get healed quickly and come over to your house.
I will definitely come over too.
Yes.
You must come.
"Yes, I will definitely come."
No Ri didn't cry... and he held it in really well.
He's probably had to say goodbye to a friend that's gotten discharged first before.
Even though he's sad too.
"Eun Jo, we're going."
Eun Jo!
Congratulations on your discharge from the hospital!
"Ha Ni, you came back well!"
"Dad, what is all this?"
It seemed like I didn't know how you felt... and that I was being stubborn about doing things my way.
Dad.
"Up til now, the upstairs room... was really uncomfortable, wasn't it?"
"Seeing you cry (laugh?) at the hospital, I thought that you must be a part of this family."
Welcome Ha Ni.
(Seung Jo's) Mother.
Yeah.
"Welcome back, Ha Ni!"
"Thank you, Ahjushi."
Then what about my room?
Your room is with your brother.
No!
I don't want to give up my room again.
You need to say thank you to your noona.
No.
I just did what I had to do.
I'm tired.
"And Pryor, the man I really wanted was you."
That's very flattering.
Maybe.
"But unless you want him to die in your place, you better get that money."
"Well, I'll-- I'll have to think about it."
"Well, don't you take long."
I'll call back and don't you call the police.
You're being watched.
Hello?
Hello?
Did you recognize that voice?
Was that anybody you knew?
"No, I don't think so."
Was that him again?
Yes.
He's got Jordan.
Apparently I was number one on his shopping list but he made a mistake.
"Are those the pictures, Mrs. Pryor?"
"Oh, yes."
"Yes, this one."

Hey! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Baek Seung Jo is running with me Oh! it doesn't seem true. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; It really doesn't seem true.
"So passionate eyes, so beautiful eyes!"
I'm in love with those eyes!
Good evening.
Kornei!
Where's Lyuty?
- Does it hurt?
- I don't mind.
"Oh, come on!"
Really.
I'd gladly get wounded every day if...
Sit still!
I'm in love with those eyes...
I'm afraid of those eyes...
- What?
- I killed the bastard.
"What are we to do with them, Comrade Danka?"
"Go up on the belfry, call the people together."
Let them decide.
Vodka...
"One fine day, Devil Was feeling bored."
"He went to Soldier's house, Knocked at the door."
"Said to Soldier's wife,  "" I'll be no trouble,"
"Just sit in the corner, Still as rubble. """
"Said he to her, "" I'll be no trouble,"
"Just sit next to you, Still as rubble. """
"Soldier's Wife had lived alone, Many a year."
"Devil moved in, His purpose clear."
Twelve months went by.
In Devil's seat
Sat seven little Devils eager to eat.
"I'd gladly join Wife this very day,"
But Devil Makhno stands in the way.
"Oh, I'm so sorry."
Rumors have spread everywhere.
Huh?!
Are you sad?
Since the girl that was following you has left?
Seung Jo ah!
"Oh, it's the main lead of the rumor."
"Miss Calm Cat,"
When did you become like that with Kyung sunbae?
Have you heard?
The rumor that doesn't make any sense.
I'm leaving first.
Good luck
Congratulations.
Can you stay here by yourself until your brother comes back?
Of course.
I don't know when Seung Jo is coming though.
Do you think I'm a baby?
I also.... need to spend some time alone.
Look at you.
That's right.
"Alright, Eun Jo, We'll see you tomorrow."
Hurry!
Don't play too many games.
I won't.
Just leave quickly.
Let's go.
Ok
Aigoo
Alright!
Oh!
"""Seung Jo ah"" &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I came all the way here without even realizing it. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; How did I end up here? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;And it wasn't that long ago when I was so happy that we had our first date."
Let them be happy...
Sorry...
You bring us tea and etc...
That's why...
Bring your tea when you come next time.
I'll brew it for you...
"Please, no money!"
Mustooo!
My brother!
How are you?
Eh?
Look what Muko brother has brought for you...
Do you remember what you did to neighbourhood's dogs and cats?
"Wasn't this Uncle Aslan's dog, Kral (King)?"
Do you remember this?
We used to hunt with this in the garden of your village house.
You were the best slingshooter.
The children of the village still have marks on their head.
All of them are your marks...
"Look, do you remember this?"
"You did this to me, remember?"
"He doesn't even look, dude..."
He is completely lost.
Unbelievable...
My brother...
My dearest brother...
Come on...
Take this.
Musto???
You see...
"He took the sling, dude."
"Keep your maniac under control, brother..."
Fine!
I am dead for you!
"But don""t instigate my son!"
Who are you to separate me from my son? son?
Whose son?
"A criminal""s son?"
"A smuggler""s son?"
Take your son!
I hate him! seema!
You can hate me as much as you want!
"But don""t abuse my son."
Nobody is born evil in this world.
"People""s circumstances make them evil."
"20 years ago, destiny played a cruel joke on my family."
You know.. my father used to work in the lighthouse. stop!
Think before you do anything!
I have thought about it!
"Let""s inform the police!"
How will we reach to the police? smugglers have surrounded the lighthouse!
Have you also joined hands with them?
You may think so.
Traitors!
"Today because of people like you.. ..the country""s state is bad!"
Patriot! sheela!
You! - shekhar!
What happened to you?
- Father!
Who has done this to you?
Traitors!
Raman has joined hands with the smugglers!
Today I saw him.. and he did this to me!
"I won""t spare him!"
So there are lots of seafood restaurants near here.
"Like Busan of Korea, sort of?"
I think I'm near the coastline.
"Yes, that's where I'm filming for the MV."
Young Jae looks really like a model today.
We're finished with lip-synching now. only one last scene in San Francisco remains.
I'm scared.
They don't bite right?
Nah they don't.
They say this is a town for rich people.
Doesn't it look like a set?
I guess these places are models for sets.
None
It's pretty good.
I hear Americans usually sprinkle cold lemon on shrimp to eat.
But I think Koreans heat up shrimp to eat.
I guess only Americans do this.
I think for some people it suits their tastes.
I don't really like seafood.
"San Francisco video shoot is a wrap! okay, good job for now."
Good bye.
Now we'll be moving on from San Francisco to Las Vegas to film.
This is Las Vegas.
The weather is really nice.
It's warm.
Las Vegas!
It's warm.
"Weather is good, scenery is good."
I feel good.
"""Seoul, Tokyo N New York City"""
Everyone is making bets going around.
Las Vegas!
"Mira!&amp;gt; Okay , we will talk later."
Can you stop for a minute?
I am trying to explain you something.
Can you wait for a minute?-it's OK.
Stop it!
Stop it!
Please!
You always are like this.
Go!

"Yes..&amp;gt; Ayse, hello.."
Kenan?!
Where are you?
Are you out?
"Not at all girl, don't be happy right away."
Where are you calling from?
"Cut it off, I can't talk for long."
"Ayse, I need Yaman's phone number, could you find it?"
"Just a minute I have it registered on my phone, I have to search it."
Are you OK?
Did you get my letter?
Did you write a letter?
"No, I didn't get anything."
"Come on, I really don't have time."
"We will talk with you later, give me that phone number."
"Okay , I'm spelling it."
"Ah man, Mert!"
I brought you lucky chestnuts instead of lucky rice.(kind of believe that -special rice blessed with prayers brings luck
Yes!
"You're happy I got tickets for the game, huh?"
Yeah yeah
Huh?
"You're happy, huh?"
"Yeah yeah, it's great"
"That's a nice gift, isn't it?"
Yes!
"It really pleased you, huh"
"It wasn't easy to get tickets, huh"
"Well, it was easy for me, one my friends works in an office and was able to give me tickets"
"On top of that, we have good seats, I think"
"I'm not a soccer fan, but, really, I'm happy"
"Also, I must say it's a beautiful game"
"A nice game, no, really, I like it"
"I feel good seeing him happy, it pleases me, it's..."
Really...
Thank you!!!
"Oh, you're not gonna put make-up on, again?"
"Look, Loulou, my lipstick is all gone"
What?
Miss Universe!
Miss Universe...
"Careful, there, oh!"
"Stop it, Loulou, you're being silly"
"Oh, come on!"
"But, look, you're an idiot!"
Careful!
"Stop it, Loulou, it's really not funny!"
"I know it's not funny, can't do anyhting about it, it's the car that does that all the time"
"Stop it, I'm telling you!"
"Oh, come on, breathe!"
"Cind-who? fuck'n ""rella""?"
Jesus!
Who the hell's naming these kids?
Goddamn my head.
So it turned into a yearly ritual.
Is that a crime?
Yes.
"OK I have a huge family, and yes OK I may have snuck into their homes after dark - but only because I didn't want to wake them."
What?
I told you - I'm not one to skimp on the Gandja..
Ahhh... it's called MUNCHlEEEES.
Ya - all I did was eat a few cookies and maybe grab a glass of milk?
And are you forgetting I DlD leave them a few gifts?..
So what?
What's the difference if I do the Return or someone else does the return for me?
They still get to exchange it for something they want.
Oh come-on.
I'm sure a toddler can find something cool from Joe's Big-Boy Shop.
What?
No fuck'n way!
You can't pin that on me!
I have absolutely nothing to do with that kid Jesus.
I want a lawyer.
"Yo Guys, it is Keralis, I am here just to tell ya that I am livestreaming."
"Um, hm."
That's right.
Keralis space program.
Www.
Triple w. twitch.tv/Keralis links the description.

There was a disturbance.
Another disturbance.
Always a disturbance with you.
"Come on, 21 minutes ago, in comes order."
"Harmattan, Burton &amp;amp; Smith."
Eight extra-large deep-dish pizzas.
"In eight minutes, I am defaulting on Joe's 29-minute guarantee."
"Then, not only am I receiving no money for these pizzas... ...but I will lose the customer forever to Pizza Yurt."
"Look, you are my only hope, all right?"
You have to make it in time.
"Peter, you're a nice guy."
But you're just not dependable.
This is your last chance.
You have to go 42 blocks in 7 1/2 minutes or your ass is fired.
Go!
"Hey, what, are you stupid?"
Whoa!
He stole that guy's pizzas!
I'm gonna get it!
"Hey, you guys."
No playing in the streets.
"Yes, Mr. Spider-Man."
See you.
"Way to go, Spidey!"
Pizza time.
You're late.
I'm not paying for those.
"Joe's 29-minute guarantee is a promise, man."
"I know to you, Parker, a promise means nothing."
"But to me, is serious."
"Is serious to me too, Mr. Aziz."
You're fired.

Making me wait here for hours.Locked in this room.
Kendin geziyorsun tabi maaşallah.
Do you have to brush me downas soon as I'm back?
I was busy with work and stuff.It's not like I'm late on purpose.
You don't carewhat this woman is doing with no money.
I didn't even eat anything.
"- Okay, okay."
"I'll order something now.- You're very generous, thank you."
"Hey, okayI am sorry."
"I said sorry, girl."
"Okay, I've acted like a jackass.I'm sorry."
"Okay, I won't be late next time."
Mukaddes you're prolonging this.

Smile.
As if I could smile right now...
"Anyway, I shall go wash my face."
"And then we go and eat, okay?"
"- So, did you go to the doctor?- Tsk."
[No]
"I went to the nursery school, to see my son."
"Gil Dong, the soldiers are coming!"
"Run, quickly!"
I told you not to look for me!
There's no time!
"I'll try to divert the soldiers, so you run that way!"
You!
Are you going to die in my stead?
Why would I die?
Do you know how fast I am? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I'm faster than you and faster than arrows!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
So run away!
How can you be faster than arrows? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Stupid girl.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
I don't hear anything now.
Do you think they're far from here?
I can't see.
Move your hand...!

Chungyi ran away!

She's safe.
But we have a problem.
Why are you running away?
Hey!

We can't be seen by her.
We have to go!
Where did he go?
Hey! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Are you in here?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Why did you just leave like that?
Who are you? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Why did you help me?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Quick! we need to make a sign.../get their attention not tath sign/not like that!
"I know, I need to fire the flare gun I was saving here it is"
"-Dad, you hit the plane.  -what? and I didn't even aim!"
"If I aim, I hit. something hit Ludoviquito on the head"

"- It looks like a radio, no? -well...."
"-ow, ouch. -oh son, not so loud we can't hear a thing. which song can I play for you?"
"-The one by Sepito -No, no."
Ask for help stupid
Do you have the one called 'help stupid'?
"-No, no."
Ask to be rescued!
"No, I don't want to leave."
"Don't get me wrong Federica, but nothing could make me go back to the City Peluche, never ever..."

World Cup final between .... and ....
Help!
Help!
Help!
Hello?
Anyone?
SOS?
"-SOS, or whoever."
-Speaking...
I'll put some clothes on.
So you are the Major?
I was the Major.
I guess to some I still am.
"Now, Terry here was my right-hand man back in the glory days."
"That was a long time ago, mate."
Why'd you get out of it?
I was a crazy bastard back then.
Yes I'm
I just want to be a boxer first
I'm so sorry
"Hey, fella."
I think you can help.
Coem with me
How'd you like to go to a movie premiere?
I'm hurt
[Light music]
Here I go out to sea again.
Sunshine fills my head and dreams hang in the air.
Gulls in the sky and in my blue eyes you know it feels unfair.
There's magic everywhere.
Look at me standing here on my own again.
Up straight in sunshine.
No need to run and hide.
"It's a wonderful, wonderful life."
No need to hide and cry.
"It's a wonderful, wonderful life."
The sun's in your eyes.
The heat is in your hair.
They seem to hate you because you're there.
"And I need a friend, oh, I need a friend to make me happy."
Not stand here on my own.
Look at me standing here on my own again.
Up straight in the sunshine.
No need to run and hide.
"It's a wonderful, wonderful life."
No need to run and cry.
"It's a wonderful, wonderful life."
[saxophone]
"I need a friend, oh, I need a friend to make me happy, not so alone."
She doesn't even get tired and comes very often...
Baek Eun Jo.
How could you talk to your life saver like that??
That's alright.
It seems like you're not getting tested today.
Yes.
"In the end, her motive for coming here is about hyung anyways."
Here you go again.
Seung Jo didn't come yet?
"See, I told you."
It's all about Seung Jo.
If you keep saying that...
He'll be coming soon.
It seems that Ha Ni should come back home.
Again?
You came?
"Baek Seung Jo, even if you talk like that..."
"Seung Jo, now that you know Ha Ni you feel great right?"
"Eun Jo, are you okay? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net"
How is Eun Jo?
We would be in big trouble if Ha Ni wasn't there.
True.
It would have been a disaster without Ha Ni.
Thank you.
"Thank you, Oh Ki Dong."
It's a relief that everything is fine.
How is the building of your house coming along?
Is it doing alright?
"You know, it's a major pain."
It happened because of the earthquake so the insurance won't really pay for it either.
We're still fighting over it right now.
"It'll all go well, I guess."
"Well, again, Tilda Swinton."
Thank you so much for doing this.
It's really a treat.
"We'll get into your career in a moment, but first I'd just"
like to ask you about the name Tilda.
It's Pretty unusual.
How did your parents choose that name?
TlLDA SWlNTON:
"It's a funny story, really."
Most people do think it is short for Mathilda.
"Actually, it is, it is long for Ilda."
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"Oh, that's counter intuitive."
So your parents just named you Ilda?
TlLDA SWlNTON:
"No, no."
I chose it for myself on my second solstice.
Mommy and poppy never gave me a name.
"Not that they didn't love me, but woodland cattle can't speak."
Most people know this.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
OK.
"So tell me, Tilda, when did you know that you wanted to be an actress?"
TlLDA SWlNTON:
I am not an actress.
That's a pretend name for a job that does not exist.
I am a gardener of art.
I grow it.
I pluck it.
I eat it.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Then let's set aside acting for a moment.
You're really smart?
Are all those people with you well?
Of course!
I didn't even get a chance to greet them properly.
"Yes, we were preoccupied too because of Gil Dong...!"
Damn it!
I know Gil Dong is dead.
"Yes, we heard the news too."
- Were you alright when you heard?
- Of course.
The living must keep on living.
"That's good, Doe Eyes."
You've forgotten him already.
What are you doing?
Still peddling medicine?
"No, my grandfather sells the medicine."
I work for Yongmun.
Yongmun?
"I'm really close to the Young Master, and somehow I ended up working for them."
"By Young Master, you mean that fellow that is slightly better-looking than me?"
"That's right, the good-looking Young Master."
He must be really nice to you.
"I'm not that dumb, you know."
But I think the Young Master is in love with me.
He must have bought her another chamber pot.
"The other day, he embraced me!"
- So how did you feel?
- Me?
I...
I just...
Why are you asking me that?
Just drink.
You?
"- Yes, son."
You are very bold!
You looks so scared as if I'm kidnapping you.
Unmannerly girl!
Just now you said I'm a spring of the garden.
Shut up!
Santo!
Raghu!
Where have they gone?
"Don't worry, Mr. Shreekant."
We've informed all the police forces across the state and Goa.
Yes.
And we're looking for them.
"If possible, connect me to the IGs of Gujarat and Karnataka, too."
"Okay, sir."
I'll talk to them now.
Thank you.
What happened?
What happened?
I'm missing my parents.
I saw a nightmare.
Nightmares are to be forgotten once you open your eyes.
Why to trust them?
Father is so careless about me.
He didn't care to know where I am and in what condition.
But we keep him informed.
Why do you take tension?
All the police officers are same.
You've got no heart but a stone.
How do you know what living means... without parents?
You'd never feel that.
Reşat Bey has been waiting for you.
- Hello.
- Hello Turaner Bey.
"Believe me, I am terribly sorry."
We're facing a very ugly slander.
"But, we won't let it go any further."
- We took our precautions.
"- It's too late, Reşat Bey."
It will be front pages of every big newspaper in the early edition.
[Song:
Kimseye Etmem Şikayet Singer:
Şevval Sam]
Oh God!
"Is he OK, Fevzi?"
Is he wounded?
Call an ambulance.
Quick!
"OK, I am on it."
For the love of God.
Don't talk reproachfully to me.
Please.
- Do you know how bad I feel?
"- I can imagine, my dear."
But you didn't call me once today.
"You make me feel lonely, when I need to hear your voice the most."
"Don't talk as if you don't know what I've been doing, and how busy I am."
I'm working to clean up those idiots mess.
"And now we have the girl's fiancé deal with, too."
I weaved between the town and the prosecution office all day.
I didn't have time to blink an eye.
It won't be easy to cover this up.
I am so scared.
Tell me your name.
"One, two, three, four, five, six."
"One, two, three, four, five, six."
Trick or treat.
I give you treats and tricks.
"One, two, three, four, five, six."
Father Moore!
Papa!
Emily!
Emily!
"She feels so hot, Father!"
She's burning up!
Hold her down there on the straw!
Hold her!
Emily!
Doctor!
I need you here now.
Watch her vital signs.
In the beginning was the word.
And the word was with God.
"And the word was the word, and what a wonderful word it was."
Through him all things remain.
"Without him, nothing was made that has been made."
"And the 70 disciples returned again with joy, saying:"
"""Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name."""
Her heart is racing.
It's almost 180 beats a minute.
I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.
Behold.
I give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions... ...and over all the power of the enemy.
"And nothing shall, by any means, hurt you."
Get it off!
- That's more like it.
A shoe?
So you won't listen?
- No.
What have you done?!
You have ruined my uniform.
What will I wear to the function now?
What happened?
"Aunty, see what this crazy girl has done."
She has wet my clothes.
She threw water on me.
How can I go to the function in these clothes?
Your love and affection has spoilt....
"What happened, aunty?"
- Nothing
Don't worry.
I'll iron them out.
Renu...
Hey fatso!
Your clothes have come.
Get ready soon.
"Tut, tut!"
You shouldn't say that.
"- Yes, you're right."
What is the function about?
They'll distribute awards and deliver lectures.
Sit.
If it isn't too much of a bother could I have a cup of tea?
I'll get it.
"Dear sister Vandana,..."
Suraj has finished his Air Force training... ... and now he is an Indian Air Force pilot.
"The responsibility that you delegated to me,... ... to fulfil Suraj's father's dream,... ... has been fulfilled by me."
Bonnie...
This was a mistake.
"She has no magic, she can't help us."
"Bonnie, wait, please."
Don't go.
Talk to me.
Please?
I'll wait outside.
"Hi, Elena."
Nice lake house.
"You know, we never got a chance to officially meet, doctor...Fell."
"You're Alaric's friend, right?"
Damon Salvatore.
Saw you at the council meeting.
What are you doing here?
Strolling the halls.
I like to wave at the newborns through the window.
Sorry about your boyfriend.
Animal attack.
Brutal.
Ex-boyfriend.
And thanks.
I'm still kind of processing.
"Yeah, I'm sure."
"You know, I just thought I'd come by and tell you that it wasn't an animal attack."
And then I realized.
You signed the death certificate.
Would you rather I say he was staked like a vampire?
"Wasn't he the guy that coined the phrase ""animal attack""?"
Why do you even care?
Because Ric likes you.
"And if you're a psychopath, it would probably really suck for him."
I have been waiting for this day for so long!
You always wait for bad days.
But not me!
Let me tell you!
"I won""t get seema married to him!"
Listen..
Lajwanti!
You know they are childhood friends!
They like each other!
To hell with that!
I have always been against this relationship!
And I will always be against it!
"More than me, you will regret it."
"Aunt, I have come to talk about my friend Rajesh alliance""s.. ..and not my alliance."
For sP?
"Why didn""t you tell me before?"
We accept this alliance!
Wait!
I will just bring sweets!
ls somebody there? shekhar.. what is all this?
"lt""s all about destiny, Mr. Diwan. congratulations! shekhar! shekhar, what have you done?"
ls this the reward of my love?
"No, seema."
Fate is testing me.
Friend has asked for the sacrifice of love.
"But why are you making me the victim of this friendship, shekhar!"
"What""s my fault?"
"I am helpless, seema. l have given my promise."
"Now even if God told me, still I can""t break my promise."
Who are you to take decision of my destiny?
lf you are helpless then I too am helpless!
"But I can""t kill my love like this!"
Who will treat me like a human?
"Look, don't behave like this."
Think that your baby feels whatever you feel right now.
"Ok, my baby..."
"Ok, my baby..."
I shut up...
Everything is fine.
Ok...
Narin...
"I didn't have the face to come to you, so I came to your mother."
"But, God wanted you to hear what I said."
You see...
Have you heard?
"Ok, don't forgive me and Mustafa, but..."
Please don't attribute our sins to this innocent baby.
"You have a conscience, Narin..."
Don't leave us in the dark...
Please Narin...
"The things Asiye told, are they true?"
Is Mustafa like a child?
"Yes, that's true."
"He didn't recognize me, either."
He only recognized only you from the pictures.
All of these wouldn't happen if he could forget only me.
You're right.
Don't go alone at this hour.
I will go alone.
I am not afraid.
"My lord, brighten my path and keep my heart pure..."
Please don't see me as one of your cruel servants...
Good morning Yasar...
Could you please take me to Mustafa?
Law may give bail to Jackie's men.
But I want an order of Jackie's death penalty.
"Don't worry, uncle."
I've prepared such strong case against Jackie... ...that even the supreme court can't save him from the gallows.
Jackie surrendered?
- Yes.
Why?
Why?
- Because Radha told him to do so.
What?
- Because Radha is in love with him.
What?
Radha?
Which Radha?
Our Radha!
Radha takes him as her husband.
Radha has taken a promise from him to be a good citizen.
This enmity has turned into a love story.
Serious!
Serious!
Serious love story!
"And if Jackie is hanged, Radha..."
Radha... what will she do?
"I'll commit suicide, brother."
I can't live without Kishan!
"He isn't a criminal, brother."
He's made a criminal.
I've never hidden anything from you and sister-in-law.
I swear upon you... ...he never looked at me with evil intentions.
Had he wished... he could have done anything with me.
"But for the sake of my love, he embraced death."
"Save him, brother."
- Where should I put my hands?
- The waist is safest.
You're a quick learner.
"Now, tongues."
They're a health and safety issue.
The secret is to strike the right balance between yielding and giving.
"Start slowly, like a turtle, not a lizard."
Avoid washing machine syndrome.
"Sadly, this session's over."
My next client's here.
"- Hi, Georgia."
"- Hi, El."
"Thank you, Georgia."
I'll be in touch.
"You did tongues, didn't you?"
Number six.
"You did a big fat tongue sandwich, didn't you?"
"Oh, my God."
"All I know is, he was from Saliva City."
But who cares?
I'm a snogging sensation.
Wait!
Mum?
Dad?
I just want you both to know how much I really appreciate all you've done for me.
"I mean, it can't be easy since you can hardly remember being my age"
'cause it was so long ago.
Have you been inhaling fumes from the science lab?
I want to talk party details.
"Oh, Georgia."
I told you I needed to talk about something important.
"Oh, this is important!"
I wrote a letter to him.
It's easier then speaking.
I explained everything from the beginning.
I told him you and me were too new.
Then I told him everything I feel.
"My emotion, my concerns, everything."
I poured my heart out to him.
I hope he'll understand me.
How are you?
Are you in the station?
"Yes, I am drown in paper work since I was called back to duty."
I thought that case was closed.
"I mean, the guy is caught."
It is over.
"A second Demet, please hold on a sec."
"Hello, yes Aziz?"
"Deniz Hanım, returned to the country a week after she left it."
- And she didn't leave again.
- So she's in Turkey for two and a half months.
"- Yes, abi."
"- Okay, thanks."
- Hello.
"- Hello, what's up?"
Maybe I should call you later.
There's a connection between Ferhat's daughter and the man who said he killed Ferhat.
"I need to talk to Mirza, please find a way."
"There's no way, Deniz."
If they see you with him... ... it will peril the plausibility of his statement.
Maybe he'll die even before the trial.
The last reports were very bad.
- Wish I could at least say goodbye.
- He doesn't want that.
"Well, uh, let's see, something wrong with the distributor I think."
Want me to give you a hand?
Thank you.
I sure appreciate it.
"Well, it doesn't look too serious."
Good.
( dramatic theme playing )
( phone rings )
I'll get it.
Hello.
"Uh, let me talk to your mother."
"It's for you, Mom."
Hello.
Hello.
Mrs. Pryor?
Yes.
"Now, you look, I've got your husband."
What?
"If you want to get him back you're gonna have to pay me $100,000."
What are you talking about?
I guess you heard me all right.
Now you better start thinking about that money.
"For your information, my husband is right here at home."
"Believe me, I've got him and I'm not going to give him back until you pay."
"It's the first time I've done this kind of thing and I'm nervous about it, so don't kid around with me because I might hurt the man."
I don't know what kind of a sick mind you've got but I don't appreciate your sense of humor.
( dramatic theme playing )
Cheyney...
did you make the call?
"Cheyney, did you make the call?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, well, what'd she say, Cheyney?"
Nobody's in it.
"Um, I think there's only one floor with any people on it."
[Anthem playing in background]
"We're in the hotel room and, um, we've been told that they're bugged."
That they're listening to us.
I don't know if whispering is going to help.
That might be where it all stems from.
Hello!
Hello!
"Come in, Come in Tokyo."
"Hello, Hello."
"Hello, Hello."
We're here.
[Woman singing on TV]
"Right after we get there, we were taken for our first meal."
"The first time you eat in North Korea, it's kind of a sign of the very weird things to come."
[Girls laughing]
[Girl speaking Korean]
Is this where we go?
Here?
The table is over here.
We're in a big banquet room.
As you can see it's huge.
There's about 20 women who are getting ready for our dinner.
"First of all, they give you about 3 or 4 courses of absolutely inedible food."
It's just matter.
It's like fried matter.
"And you're kinda going, yeah, yeah."
"But you're waiting for every one to fill in, when's this banquet happening?"
When's the banquet?
There is no banquet.
Where is everyone?
Why didn't you answer your phone?
- It's nothing.
- Are you gonna come pick us up?
Is Fatmagül all right?
- Where are you?
- I don't know...
"It says ""Dolapdere Taksim"" Do we take the turn here?"
I don't know either.
"Hold on, let me ask somebody here."
"Okay, call me right away."
- Let us forward a bit then...
"- Let's not get lost, Mukaddes."
Shut up Rahmi.
I am so tired already.
"- Damn it, what's your hurry?"
- Be careful Mukaddes!
I'll go get your brother and yenge.
Stop being stubborn.
Just eat these.
"You passed out, out of hunger."
Eat them before they get cold.
You'll feel better.
I shouldn't have known...
- How stupid I am...
"- You couldn't have known, something that didn't happen."
I've explained that non sense to you how many times now?
There was something strange that night... ... with the three of you.
"And then, that woman..."
She said she was Fatmagül Ketenci's brother's wife.
What did she come to talk with your dad about?
God...
The woman was looking for her when she was missing.
It's my first time on an elevator in Las Vegas.
You haven't in the hotel?
Did you walk up to the hotel room?
We were on the 20th floor.
- We didn't film then.
- You're right.
That's why this is my first time.
"Wow, elevators in Las Vegas go up too."
Same as Korean ones.
Great work.
It feels just like Las Vegas.
Great work.
We're in Las Vegas.
We just finished shooting for the MV.
I had an all-nighter yesterday and couldn't sleep today.
I just woke up in the middle of my nap to come to the shooting.
The director expected me to look awake.
"So I was jumping around, trying to be hyper."
Thankfully the scenery was great
So I could get in a happy mood.
(Satisfied) I'm feeling pretty good now.
I'm all done filming so I'll be leaving with the photographer.
None
We played like crazy on the bus.
You can only check it out in the MV.
We'll be all done at the desert.
The desert scene is the final one.
"""We're Hurricane, We're Hurricane"""
I've gone insane.
I've been up for almost 24 hours.
We're heading to the desert now it'll take about 20-30 minutes.
"It's where the scorpions live, my favorite."

I love you. man:

I love you too.

man speaking native language:
You need to have a pee.
Tai-Chan.
"If you don't pee, you can't watch TV, can you?"
Hmm?
Hey.
Here we go.
boy:
Why do you have lots of hair growing? man speaking native language:
Because I'm a man. boy speaking native language:
What about women? man:
"Women don't have hair, not as much."
[man speaking native language]
Say good morning to mummy. boy speaking native language:
Good morning. man speaking native language:
Here's the incense. boy speaking native language:
I don't want to. man:
"Daddy will do it alone then, Tai-Chan."
"Tai-Chan, here, sound the bell."
"When daddy has put the incense in, you can sound the bell."
[bell rings]
Not yet.
"In his things we found fishing lines, hooks and lures!"
What do you think he was going to do with all that?
I think we've all had quite enough.
I have therefore decided to expel Inochkin.
I'm done.
"""No exit without permission."""
- Kostya!
Kostya!
- Come back to visit!
- Come back to visit!
- Comrade Dynin?
- That's my name.
- Comrade Dynin.
"- What ""comrade Dynin?"""
- It's not fair.
I think...
- You think too much.
- What's so horrible about what he did?
- How long have you worked here?
"- All right, this is my first year..."
- Want some fruit punch?
- But he's a swimmer!
2:12 on his back!
- Those who don't swim don't drown.
It's the other ones who drown.
You think it was easy for me to tear Inochkin from my heart like that?
"- Then bring him back, comrade Dynin!"
I'll take full responsibility!
"- All right, calm down."
- Then I'll go get him?
- Wait till I'm finished talking!
- You're all flustered about this Inochkin.
"What do you think of your old duds now, Applejack?"
"Pretty swanky, are they not?"
And Twilight!
I made this dress for you... ...and I designed each outfit theme to perfectly reflect each pony's unique personality.
"Oh, it took me forever to get the colors right on this one, Rainbow Dash, but I did it."
"Oh, and it turned out BEAUTlFUL, don't you think?"
"Ooo, and I know you are going to love yours, Fluttershy."
It just sings spring!
"And Pinkie Pie, look!"
Pink!
Your favorite!
Aren't they all amazing?
Wow...
-They're...
"-Yeah, they're..."
They sure are...
-...sumth'n.
-Yes!
Something.
I love something!
Something is my favorite!
It's... nice.
But what's the matter?
Don't you like them?
They're very nice...
And we're plum grateful cause you worked so hard on them.
Mine's just not as cool as I was imagining.
She asked.
I guess what we're all saying is that they're just not what we had in mind.
That's okay.
Not a problem.
There's plenty more where that came from.
He's panicked as well.
He'll probably say what I've already told you.
I wasn't going to answer him anyway.
I don't want to talk to anyone.
"Don't go, man."
It's okay.
I got it.
Don't talk to anybody.
"And tell the girl not to, as well."
"Thank you very much, Cemil Bey."
Much appreciated.
We're done here.
Thank God we had a connection here.
We don't have to wait anymore.
Your visa is in your pocket.
Let's go book a flight now.
So that you'll waste no time.
Every day you spend here is against you.
- Hello.
"- Good evening Meryem Hanım, how are you?"
How am I...
I am packing his stuff.
Maybe he'll need them in Istanbul.
I've spoken to a friend of mine who lives in Istanbul.
"You know, the one I mentioned before who might help Kerim out."
"- Oh, thank you."
- I explained to him the situation.
"- Of course, only the bits he must know."
- Thank you.
"Thankfully he said ""I'll help him, make him call me."""
He'll find a place for him to stay.
I'll give you his number.
"I don't think you have any, I don't seen Corel draw ."
"You know, I don't think that we focused."
"In that case , I mean Painter, which is actually used for children's publications."
"Oh, really?"
"Yeah, we haven't, I don't think that we ."
"Oh, no."
You do have .
I can tell with the others as well.
"Uh, I missed the update, so you do have essential training in teacher twelve, not four, this came out the,"
"February, the fifteenth."
Yeah.
"So I do, I did have not."
All right.
And we.
"Yeah, I just realized that, I'll have to go back take a look at that again."
"And we have um, finished shooting, um."
"Uh, course the shooting with the Nikon D800."
So that will come out in November.
"Oh, November."
"Okay, great!"
"Yeah, yeah."
"So you can spend your um, your holidays."
Watching movies.
Okay.
Exactly. .
"Uh, that's good."
That's good.
That's good.
"Um, okay. ,, ."
"Uh, do you have any questions for me or anything that you would like to add that you feel would be particularly helpful for us as we look at 2013?"
Um.
No.
"They say Budyonny thought of that, honest to God!"
Here they come...
"And now, the fair-haired Josie!"
Never shall I forget
That wondrous night -
Our two hearts pledged
To a future bright.
You laughed at the fears
That did harry me...
You promised... that night...
To marry me.
"The night flew by, the night flew by,"
The morning brought a leaden sky.
"Night again, night again,"
"This night, alas, a night of rain."
"That night is gone,"
That night is gone.
I cannot believe
That all is over...
The romance is ended.
Sing some more!
More!
Dance for us!
"What's so funny, you apes?"
So you caught the kid.
"Your pa was quicker than you, wasn't he?"
Didn't hurt yourself?
"Come on, let's have some kvass."
You think that Sidor Lyuty's heart don't ache for you war orphans?
It aches all right.
But in times like these we can't help having orphans.
Know how many of my pals your pa did away with?
He wants a lot.
"He has big demands, boss!"
He wants 1500 gm of gold.
"You don""t worry."
I have said yes on your behalf!
Fool!
Will your father bring 1500 gm of gold?
Go and bring breakfast!
Bring breakfast for 2 people!
I have come to meet you!
- I was waiting for you!
But sP is always busy!
I wish I was Tiger singh.
You would have then followed me thinking me to be a culprit.
Under this pretext I would have got.. ..the chance to meet my friend.
What do I tell you?
I had come to arrest Tiger singh!
And I myself have landed into trouble.
What trouble?
- A beautiful trouble.
Where did you find her?
- ln your city.
"I couldn""t stop looking at her when I saw her for the first time."
"When I saw her for the second time, I lost my heart."
"When I saw her for the third time, I lost my senses."
Where does she lives?
- ln my heart.
"When we were in London, you would never take.. ..any decision without consulting your friend."
And here you fell in love without informing your friend.
"Till the time I don""t fix the alliance with her parents.. ..how can I give her name to you?"
"Then give me the girl""s father""s name."
Diwan Dinanath!
I don't feel I'm driving.
I can't wait til next family gathering.
"Friday, 5pm., I'm sure  I'll get there on time."
Especially wishes.
"Wow, a good driver..."
I bet it's a woman.
"Damn, we spend so much  money on legal music and software."
If I was a driving examiner  I'd also give him a driving licence.
He's driving really well.
I can't wait til I can use toilet in the train.
30 MPH on the fast lane?
Great!
I can't keep up with those  new faces in politics.
"Easy, elderly lady can go."
I'm not in a hurry.
"Damn, my train is too early again!"
Cart is full but I still have  so much money in my wallet!
Vodka?
Not today.
I have to clean after my dog.
I'm driving.
"You know, I love my boss."
Are you crazy?
I'm working tomorrow.
Good that I finish full-time studies.
At least I have a job guaranteed.
I don't remember when  I last ate pork chops.
I'm sick of this sun!
I've always been interested in  tennis and cross-country.
Even when we weren't successful.
I'm sure that everything I study  will be useful on labor market
Socks and sandals?
"We don't know who's in it or what's in it, only that I think my dream's telling me to help kill Klaus."
What the hell are you doing?
I needed her to know about the coffin.
"And I needed you to keep her out of it, Bonnie."
"So what are you going to do, Stefan?"
Are you going to kidnap me so that I won't tell anyone?
"Don't tempt me, Elena."
"I think I know who can open the coffin, Stefan."
And I need Elena to help me find her.
Find who?
What are you talking about?
I couldn't place her face at first.
Then I realized...
"Oh, my God, Bonnie."
Who is this?
It's my mom.
Los alamitos?
"Um, too old."
Honolulu?
"Ugh, I wish."
How many of these are there?
A lot.
I asked the sheriff's office to pull up every single Abby Bennett in the country.
I know we haven't been able to really...
That things have been weird because of Jeremy.
So thank you for helping me with this.
I know you have a lot to deal with.
"There's nothing more important, Bonnie."
It's surreal.
Having to track down a woman who bailed on her own kid.
"You know you don't have to, right?"
Let Stefan obsess over opening up the coffin.
Look.
Kundan is just a friend.
I never thought about him like that.
"Mom, dad, at least don't fight tonight."
"Bunty, who would you prefer to stay with?"
- Katrina Kaif.
"Bunty, I am talking about the both of us"
I am divorcing your mother.
- That's a lie.
Actually I am divorcing him.
"- Very good, very good."
"You guys have fun, I am leaving."
Bunty.
Bunty.
Friends.
To make this celebration of a 33 year old mistake memorable.. ..I request Mr. Kundan Lal to sing a song in twin voices.
"Come, come."
Ladies and gentlemen.
I made this song for my dear friend.. ..Mala for her marriage with Kishen.
So can we change the mood now?
Clap.
"""Now you can do it like this."""
"""Take it to the left."
"Or you can do it like that."""
"""Shake it to the right all my ladies &amp;amp; my man and my men &amp;amp; my ladies."""
"""All my ladies and my man and my men and my ladies."""
"""You can do it like this."""
When my mom and dad didn't have any love story.. ..then what was the theme of the song?
"""Shake it to the right."""
Which song would suit such an unromantic couple?
How would both of them look singing together?
"""You can do it like this."
Dharamdas!
"Ma""am, not Dharamdas. l told you to call me DDT."
Where is your boss?
Fine!
Fine!
"I didn""t see boss going out."
"Which culprit are you searching for, sP?"
Who will be a bigger culprit than you?
You left me alone for 2 months!
Where did you disappear?
I and sister-in-law were waiting for you since a long time.
You should have peeped in your heart!
I see!
How was your journey?
- It was beautiful! open your suitcase and tell me what have you brought for me? open the suitcase!
And take whatever you like! - ls that so?
There are many things in this too! only saris in this!
I am sure this has something for me! only two suitcases?
"We didn""t get any time for shopping, Rajesh!"
"But since when did you take custom officer""s duty?"
You are searching it thoroughly.
I thought you must have brought many things for me.
"But I didn""t find anything in this. shekhar, I will leave now."
- No!
"Have tea! sorry, shekhar!"
I am on duty!
Nowadays you are so busy with your duty!
"What do I tell you, friend? lt""s all because of Tiger singh!"
"Bye, sister-in-law. see you, shekhar. shekhar.. hadn""t we brought 4 suitcases?"
"Yes, seema!"
I gave two suitcases to kaka.
Listen!
(intrigued) Oh.
There's the first one.
- (pulsating echo) - Ah.
- (pulsating echo) - No.
"No, I remember now."
"Oh, now he's gonna come."
"- (pulsating echo) - (gasps) Oh, my God."
It's thundering.
- (pulsating echo) - (whimpering)
- (faint static) - What is that?
Uh-oh.
Please don't be in here when I get out.
Is this it on the wall?
What is that?
- (Finebros) I don't know.
"- Do I go straight? - ♪ (jolting chord) ♪ - Oh, God!"
- (headphones clatter) - (high-pitched static)
- (pulsating echo) - (footsteps crunching)
- (claps) - (Finebros laugh)
My fault.
Messed up the microphone.
- At least I got one.
- (Finebros chuckle)
"I was about to quit, too, man. - ♪ (jolting chord) ♪ - Oh!"
What the (bleep)?
(high-pitched static)
"Am I going the wrong way, you guys?"
"I'm, like, shaking right now."
"I don't know if you can see it, but I'm kind of shaking."
I'm not liking Slender Man.
"I haven't even seen him, but I already don't like him."
Why does it have to be so dark?
Don't mind him brother.
He is still a child.
His mind works like a child's mind right now.
"As a matter of fact, his mind doesn't work at all..."
I will take his mind in such a way that...
"And he is like this not because of his mind,  but because of electic shock and drugs..."
"Hey, pal..."
Let it go...
Come on...
My brother!
"Yaw Mustafa, see, you make us happy by splitting his head open..."
"Come on, my ram, don't leave us..."
Why don't you say something?
I am going to burst now.
"We went there, sat with him."
We saw him.
His treatment still continues.
Don't jerk me around...
I see Aslan Bey...
He is worn out...
"Take me there to see him, please..."
For God's Sake...
I swear...
"Ok, Bahar Hanim, we go one day."
"But, please be quite a little bit."
I mean... we don't want people to hear it.
"Just a minute Asil, my brother..."
"When Bahar Hanim visited Mustafa in the hospital,  didn't he have a fever and then went into coma?"
"If we take her there, maybe he will remember something."
Eh?
Isn't that possible?
I am his medicine.
"Let me ask Mrs. Ender, let me see what will she say."
Don't let Mrs. Ender know about it please!
I can't give money to anyone without her knowledge.
How can I give it son?
"Brother, I really need it very much.Look, I will pay it back as soon as I can."
What do you need this money for?
"I family matter. &amp;gt; I'm sorry..&amp;gt; Okay, thanks."
"Yaman, here you are, 300, it's not advance payment, it's from my pocket."
But it's a debt.
"- OK, it's a debt, you will complete the rest somehow. here 50 from me, &amp;gt; Thanks, &amp;gt; and from me, &amp;gt;also from me &amp;amp;gt, me too- Thank you , Thank you all !"
This is from me.&amp;gt; thanks..
Do you have 50 TL now?
"Thanks to all of you, really, as soon as I have money in my hands I will pay it back, I promise"
How will you complete the rest?- I will see.
Thanks- May you use it for the best.
How much money would you give for this? &amp;gt; Let me see.
Mira calling.
One moment...
Hello!
Mira:
Hello!
Did you get out of the interviewing? &amp;gt; Yes.
How was it?
"Not bad- This means it was very good, right?"
I don't know.
Let me take the last exam and we will see...
What time is your exam at?-At 3 o'clock!
"I have to close it, I have to study a little more."
"OK, let me know as soon as you are out OK?"
I want you to give me the good news first.
"I will call you&amp;gt; Okay, success! &amp;gt; Thanks."
The interviewing was very good.
"- I left it in the hotel room. oh, you left it there?"
This is the point!
None
"I found out from my fan cafe, that they thought these were arm warmers."
"But guys, these aren't arm warmers."
I just put this mask on my wrist.
(Simple-minded)l didn't want to lose it.
I lose things pretty often...
So I try to always hang my belongings on my body.
- My camera - Did you shut the door?
of course you did.
Hi.
It's been 3 days in America.
- What are we filming today?
- We're filming for the MV.
"I want to live in a house like this one day. &amp;lt;""Coffee Shop"" MV First main character Dae Hyun&amp;gt;"
I'll have a wife and kids.
My wife will be cooking breakfast and I'll be playing with the kids.
"We'll eat delicious food together, and take a walk with our two puppies."
I'm glad the background looks nice.
At least I won't look tacky.
The place for my MV is the best.
The weather is fantastic.
How do I look?
It's me over flowers.
I can't really smell well because I'm sick.
But real flowers do smell good.
Do I get to rest now?
I was worried because I didn't get good sleep.
But the weather's so good it's very healing.
I'm done.
I took some pictures since I came to America.
"It's not this, but it's your imagination."
It's a big difference.
[sighs]
Now do this again.
Again.
How do you feel now?
I don't know.
Playing stupid?
I'm not playing stupid!
I don't know the right answer.
"You see, ""I don't know,"" this is playing stupid."
You did something with your heel there.
It's very chance [indiscernible]
-No.
-No.
Okay.
"No, but your hair and your features go along with the feeling I had about you earlier."
I had a feeling I could be afraid of you.
And you're the type of person that seems
"like you demand so much respect, and you're...[sighs]"
Please tell me.
I demand so much respect.
Play this what you just saw.
"Well, you know how smart I am."
"I know more about psychology than you do, Gloria, so anything I say of course is right."
Can you say the same as Gloria?
Something similar as Gloria?
Or like the same as Gloria?
I demand respect because...
I don't know.
You don't know?
"No, I don't."
Didn't the government ignore this fact even though reports were made?
We have suffered great losses in this as well.
We did this under your instructions as well as for the good of the people.
Please overlook our involvement in Choi Chul Joo's death.
Then I will ask you one question.
Some people were blocking the arrival of the police.
Do you know who they were?
- Did such a thing happen?
- Were they involved with Yongmun?
Why would we block the police's arrival?
We sacrificed a great deal because the police arrived too late!
He can't be caught!
He'll be killed!
- I feel like I'm going to die with worry!
- How will we find him on a day like this?
Young Miss!
Young Miss!
Gomi!
It's me.
Let's go!
"Gomi, come to your senses!"
Gomi is acting strange again?
Gomi!
Gomi!
The police are headed this way.
We should get out of here.
I'll head them off.
You take care of Gomi.
- Follow him!
Run!
"- Yes, Sir!"
"First explosives, and now strange fellows."
Admit Rajesh in the hospital.
"Boss, where is Jaggu?"
- I have killed him.
And you saved this enemy?
Have you decided to kill your men? - shut up!
The one who locks horn with Tiger singh.. he will be killed.
Do you know war has started in lndia?
This is the golden chance to become rich.
"Gold""s price is going to increase four times. so we will return to lndia today itself. come on."
"To save lndia, donate generously for defence fund."
"Today lndia needs gold desperately. kaka sir, we too need gold desperately."
"Mr. Anwar, come."
- Greetings. come.
"Have a seat. kaka sir, luckily there is a war."
And war is a good chance to make ourselves rich.
And our country is ready to pay any price for gold.
"That""s the misfortune, Mr. Anwar."
I am telling the truth.
I would have given you the gold.
But what to do?
"I don""t have the gold. kaka sir!"
You will get the gold.
Fix the deal with them.
Mr. Anwar!
We have gold worth 7 crores.
What price do you quote?
I am ready to give double the price! - okay!
"But we need opium, cocaine, marijuana."
Where are the goods to be delivered?
Near Lakhaidi island.
Bring the gold.
And take your goods.
"Ohh there is bazaar today, I forgot!"
If we enter we can't get out.
You go down on the right!
On the right from here!
"You come also, if you want."
"- No, I will wait in the car, you go!"
Don't hurry !
Good afternoon!
I wanted to move my registration
First let me find your registration here.
"You know how devoted I am sister. but really, i can' t endure Kenan's trouble anymore..."
"What can I say, you're right.- I gave him many opportunities, you know it.. but it's a must to break up."
He lost me.
Don't feel yourself guilty.
It's his choice..
I wrote a letter and send it to him.I told him everything was needed...
Did he ask me when he got into trouble?
Yaman was also angry with this.
"""How can you do this when the guy is in jail?"""
Do you talk with Yaman?
He calls sometimes to ask about you.
I wish you stayed with Yaman aunt!
You wouldn't be apart and your life would be better too.
My life can't be better.
My condemnation is until death.
I will be at ease when I close my eyes.
"Sister, who is Turunc Nadir?"
What? &amp;gt; Turunc Nadir
O don't know...
Who is it?
I heard uncle Hasan and Kenan fighting once.
Kenan threatened uncle Hasan with him.
"Find out what the favor she asked the official, and make sure it gets done."
I can't have another man have a flower that I can't have.
What's going on?
"The people you asked to help you, they came looking for you."
Really?
Sir!
Sir!
She's nowhere to be found!
She's disappeared!
Disappearing to where?
That doesn't make any sense!
"If she fell to here, she couldn't even manage herself properly."
"Now, are you aware of who you are?"
Who are you?
Don't you remember me?
We have seen each other in the palace grounds.
Don't worry.
You'll be safe.
I'm Seol Hye...
I was a colleague of your brother.
Brother Chun-Soo asked you to take care of me?
"Yes, that's right."
"After these events, he himself came to see me."
I think it will be difficult for Dong-Joo.
I'm sorry for delivering such news.
Forgive me for making such a hard request.
No.
I'm so grateful that you've come to me for help.
"If she's his sister, she's like my sister."
"Now, what can I do to help?"
Everything you need is in here.
"If Dong-Yi doesn't make it outside the city, then help that child stay alive."
All I fucking cared about... ...was my reputation amongst the firms of England.
"I mean, you've heard all the stories about Millwall, yeah?"
"Last match I went to was Millwall, West Ham."
We're talking a good 10 years ago.
"I mean, we'd been waiting for this match all year."
At Millwall.
Yeah.
Stepping into their ground.
Completely outnumbered.
We were fucking wired from the start.
"Now, Tommy Hatcher... ...he was their main man back then."
He used to bring his 12-year-old boy to the grounds.
Tommy Jr.
"Always banging on how he brought his kid up, you know, to be like a little pit bull."
"Well, we lost that match."
Three-nil.
And those Millwall cunts started laughing at us.
And I just fucking snapped.
"I mean, I couldn't let it lie, you know?"
"So I assembled all our troops, and we hunted them down."
I saw that little lad go down.
Tommy!
No!
And I saw his skull get crushed under the boots of the GSE.
I never went to another match after that.
And I left the Major behind.
And that's when I met your sister.
She was my angel.
She really saved me.
Showed me a new life.
Helped me forget all this bollocks.
And she swore... ...she'd leave me if I ever returned to it.
I'm sorry that I cannot touch your feet as my arm is wounded.
It's not necessary.
- Why not?
I had left with your blessings so I returned alive.
"No, my son."
Even death fears men who sacrifice their life for their country.
What did aunty say?
I've got it.
Wonderful!
Your words have strengthened my determination.
Do you know what my mother would have said?
"What have you done, my son?"
I told you not to join the defence services.
You are my only son.
"You were saved this time but, what will happen the next time?"
And then she would start crying.
For the sake of her child a mother has to cry sometime.
Some shed tears and some swallow their tears.
"What is the matter, aunty?"
Nothing.
"Aunty, can I ask you something?"
Don't you have any children?
I had a son.
He wasjust like you.
I lost him.
Your mother has come to see you.
"Please send her in, doctor."
I'll leave now.
- Why?
You must meet my mother.
- I'll meet her some other time.
"Renu, you stay here."
What sort of parents do you think we are?
- Do you really want me to answer that?
"- That's enough, missy."
- Why would we damage you?
- We made you.
"Honestly, Georgia, this attitude is..."
Welcome to the tragic universe that is my sad life.
Why?
I'll give you five major reasons why.
"Number one, my parents are from the Stone Age."
"- No us, no you."
- God knows what you'd do.
- You understand?
You wouldn't exist.
- Yeah.
"Number two, they hate me having a life 'cause theirs are practically over and mine's just starting."
- And it's not good enough.
- Honestly.
Every year it's...
- Number three. ...a performance...
My little sister's bonkers.
Poor Angus will need even more therapy than me.
- A lot of trouble! ...because of your fifteenth birthday...
- Number four... ...it's not good enough. - ... my nose is the size of Jupiter. ...so ungrateful.
- I need to go into an ugly home.
"- Georgia, what have you gone and done now?"
How did you manage to pluck them all so quickly?
"You haven't, have you?"
"Oh, crikey."
"Bob, she shaved them."
"Number five, I'll never get a boyfriend."
What's the hurry with growing up so fast?
- It's okay.
- Cemre and Zeynep are also waiting downstairs.
They didn't let them inside either.
They're waiting at the door.
Cemre came here to make an appearance?
What business does she even have here?
Her husband is the one who  made them put you in here.
"Handan Hanım, let us not talk about things we don't know."
- They sent you letters.
- You brought them with you?
They will control them first.
Then you will have the letters.
Cemre also sent you some food and drinks.
"And Zeynep, some clothes."
We have only 15 minutes.
And we'll spend that talking about Cemre and Zeynep?
"Okay, don't start arguing again."
So?
"Is there any problems, anything bothering you here?"
"No, why would anything bother me?"
Thank God...
- It is fine.
- Stay away from the bad lot.
"Yes, son, you won't spend much time here."
Just make sure you don't get in trouble.
Just close your eyes and ears.
Don't let it happen like the last time.
"Okay, don't worry."
It's not the first time I end up here.
- I talk to your lawyer everyday.
"- Me too, son."
I call him everyday.
Thank you sweetie.
"Happy birthday, sister.May your face always smile."
"Thank you, abiciğim."
I wish you a happy and healthy life.
Amin.
"- Fatmagülcüğüm, may your wishes come true, my child.- Thank you."
I am glad that you were born.
Thank you.
"Kerim Abi, everyone gave their presents.But we couldn't see yours."
He gave his present yesterday.
"Go on, cut your cake."
You see what happened to you because you didn't listen to me.
You'll do as I tell you from now on.What happened has happened.
It can't be helped.
Your blood will fade from the ground.
But you will be left alone.
It is already decided.Mustafa won't accept you anymore.
Don't cry.
Look.
Don't cry.
I was just outside for a minute.You know how everyone was staring at me?
Like this.
They're talking about you.
They say that it happened with your permission.
"You did it with your own will, they say."
- No...- Shh.
"- There were four people.- Shut up, someone will hear."
I know their faces.They were four.
Stop saying four.One was more than enough to ruin your life.
Mustafa can't help you.But I will.
"I will help you get up.And we'll go home, okay?"
You're not safe here.
Now Bhadram wants to take his revenge on us.
He wants me to repay all the debt I took from him long ago.
"If I cannot, then he wants me to marry my daughter to him."
It is better for me to hang myself than giving.. ..my daughter to him.
But I did not do it because of you.
What can we do now?
There is a way.
That producer is still waiting with money .. ..in his hands.
If my daughter agree to act in his film.. ..I can give that money to Bhadram.
How can I ask her to act in these circumstances?
"Dad, I will act in the movies."
Clear the debt with that money.
Let me wipe the blood off.
It will go in few days.
May be from that producer.
Hello producer sir!
Greetings!
"When will you give me the advance, sir?"
Do you want me to come to Warangal?
Warangal?
We are moving out from Warangal.
Good bye to you Warangal and good bye for Bhadranna.
"O rain, do not go back having droppe d from the eyes."
Stay with me like the showers and the lightning.
Why did he go away having raised love in my he art
If you want to come will I stop you?
Hey!
Venkat is here!
Venkat!
It has been a long time.
- How are you doing?
Let us go and see what happens.
"No problem we can do it later too, the important thing is that you know and don't object."
That's my work boat.
Your work boat?
"Very good, then pay it on your own!"
"Okay, Mert, we'll talk later."
"Yaman, come on son, today is the big day."
You are in the last level now.
Ah yes!
-You didn't eat anything.
I ate something
I think these frowning eyebrows are from exam's stress and...
I wish you good luck.- Thank you!
I am leaving!-Aren't we going together? :
"No, no need."
I can go on my own.
I don't want to go all together.
"It can't be, Yaman!"
I have to introduce you to the people from interview.
These things are important son.
Come on!
"I will take my jacket ,Coming..."
Madam we have to do the processing.
Please!
"No, it's impossible!"
"No- Look, don't cause trouble!"
"This can't be like this, you have to inform us first... there has to be done something before."
We sent you the notification.
I am doing my work madam.
Don't interfere please!
Don't cause trouble.
Permit us to enter in.
"Dad we are going to be late, what's happening?- Okay, dear."
We did all the work!
Older Brother...
"Thank you for protecting us, Older Brother."
Thank you for calling me like that.
Will you be... ... happy on behalf of my Hyun?
You're really weepy these days now that you're only half a man.
- Half a man?
"- He's missing half of his balls, isn't he?"
What's life anyway?
"Su Keon, you'll be fine with just half."
"Please take care of yourselves, Hwal Bin Dang."
- What Dang?
- We decided to call you that.
Because you helped us who were poor and powerless.
Hwal Bin Dang?
Is that our name now?
"That's so cool, isn't it?"
- It doesn't sound too bad.
- Let's make a flag with our new name!
Whatever...
Hwal Bin Dang?
How burdensome!
- But that's what people are calling us.
- Who cares what people say?
"- We're just thieves, that's all."
- But doesn't it feel good to have a name?
It does have a nice ring to it.
"Now that we have a name, let's go have a party!"
We have to get home safely first.
The police are still everywhere.
"When it gets dark, we'll scatter and leave the city."
We'll reconvene again in the mountain retreat.
I thought I'd die from hunger.
Ha-seok!
I've something to tell you.
What?
Slow down.
I've got tons to say too.
"Let's eat first, then talk."
You said you were hungry.
Sook-hyun!
"Try this, it's great."
Once a fireman rescued a girl from a blaze.
"Everyone else gave up on her, but he charged in like a madman."
"The fireman and the woman, they survived against crazy odds."
"So the fireman and the girl started dating, right?"
"No, he dated her sister."
She was the woman of his dream.
Aren't you glad to see me?
"I keep doing sign language, so I forget how to speak."
"I remember how to say it with my hands, but not with words."
It stays at the tip of my tongue.
"But there are words that even if I remember,"
I can't say.
Maybe I just wanted to hear it from you first.
"I have something to say too, but not here."
"This isn't a sky lounge, and there's no wine."
I can't treat you like a princess.
Hey hey!
What's going on here?
You shouldn't use public equipment for these purposes.
Can our model fireman act in this way?
Give us an explanation.
"OK, stick closer."
You have neither fighting skill nor wisdom.
You don't even have courage to fight.
Just go and hide yourself like you normally do.
Granny!
Show me how to make a pouch.
- I'll make one for you.
- No.
I want to make it myself.
I want to embroider something on it too.
What will be good?
A flower?
A bird would be better.
I should be able to make it in two weeks?
- Did you arrange to meet him then?
- Yes.
I think it'll be the last time.
"If I make a pouch for him, will he cherish it?"
I suppose this is crossing the boundary too.
It's really been a while!
"Here, have another drink."
I really respect you!
I will accept that opinion!
I should have recognized you when you called me Doe Eyes the first time!
But you tricked me by saying Goggle Eyes instead!
"So you were fooled by that, right?"
I was a bit surprised at my quick wit too.
"Farewell, Doe Eyes!"
"Farewell, Goggle Eyes!"
It's similar!
You're really smart!
"At least you understand me, Doe Eyes!"
I really respect you!
Come let us pray for our father soul.
You made him a permanent servant by calling him brother.
"Gun, How much?"
- One liter.
"Only single, why dont you take two liters."
I dont have money.
What is the need for money between us?
"Hey, prepare the bill for one liter."
If you give 2 liters I will prepare the bill for 2 liters.
Shall I give you two slaps?.
What we want is ladies.
Then fill the tank.
Anyway it is not your money.
If I fill the tank she will not come until next week.
If I fill 2 liters she will be back tomorrow morning.
What happened madam?
You are not coming so frequently.
Did you forget me?
I remembered you the day before yesterday.
What about yesterday?
I didnt go to zoo yesterday.
Personal.
"Hey venki, Venkat is here."
All of you come here.
Venkat arrived.
"Hey, move of the way."
Always blocking the way.
Why are you shouting at her?
This is a routine matter for us.
- First tell me why are you here?
What about your interview?
- Its gone.
"I called the coiffure, the girls said you weren't there all day."
I can tell something happened.
Nothing happened Cemre.
I just got a bit emotional.
I can see that.
"But I am asking ""why""."
Well...
I don't know.
It thought about how small... ... how short life is.
It is like a blink of an eye.
"I mean, one can be so determined and work too much for something... ... and then one day it all goes away."
"I mean, as if it never existed."
As if it was a big lie.
"Cemre, life is full of lies."
Every life ends the same way... ... which makes everything meaningless.
Wish I knew what makes you say all this.
I was just thinking about all these stuff... ... they got me emotional.
But really Cemre... ... we have just one life.
"One must live for herself, not for others."
One must only regret what they couldn't do.
That's how it is.
My dear...
Don't regret anything.
"Forget about others, you fight for the one you love."
Be happy with whom you love.
"Yes, sweetie..."
You love Kuzey?
Go grab his hand.
You two suffered so much.
Cemre...
You deserve to be together.
My dear...
They said he only recognized Narin from a picture and pointed her by his hand.
"And they say ""Maybe, if Narin sees him, it will be good for him."""
I won't go.
Nobody can make me go there.
I will die..
Why do you bring this topic up when she is here.
You know better...
I had to say it Mom.
"Of course, it is up to her..."
They are cursed by many people.
"Now, these curses take their toll on their children."
I have never cursed.
This is not my curse...
Not my curse...
It is from my Lord...
"How is Duriye, Doctor Bey?"
Her blood pressure is normal now.
I gave her a medicine and she is sleeping.
"But, we have to be careful."
"It doesn't matter if we are careful, her son is always on her mind."
Have you talked to Narin?
I told her everything.
"But, You have to see it from her side."
Narin said she won't go.
She already did what she wanted to do to us.
She had Mustafa wrapped around her finger.
"She stole my husband, too."
She must be laughing at us right now.
You don't eat...
You don't drink...
"And then you don't have any strength for anything, of course..."
Does a wheelchair suit a handsome young man like you?
- Mukaddes!
"- It's OK abi, no need to hurry."
"Sorry, my wife is coming now."
Good morning.
"I can understand how you feel, really."
I've met all kinds of people and situations in this profession.
I found cure to many wounded men.
"I will help you, too."
Yes.
I will help you.
"For instance, I won't file a complaint about you."
You broke into my house in the morning.
You almost suffocated me.
These are big crimes.
But I won't report you.
Thank you very much.
"Look, you go now and pull your mind together."
- And quit messing with Reşat Yaşaran.
- I am still not convinced though.
It'd be stupid of you to have him against you.
"- He is a man, whose hand you want on your back."
"- I'm fine, thanks."
You know what he said when he first heard of that incident?
"He said ""poor guy""."
"""Watch over him, don't let him ruin his own life."""
- What is it to him?
- That man works for this town!
Don't tell me bull shit!
"Look son, this man is so powerful."
Not only in this town...
He has a great empire in Istanbul.
You know how many people are working for him?
"One must not die, but kill."
One must kill.
He is not an idiot.
But he made me an idiot before everyone.
"Hey, dont cry."
It does not matter whether this coward lives or dies.
"You, old woman!"
Put the marriage mark on my face.
Hello!
Bhadranna!
Tell me what the matter is.
I am coming to Hyderabad.
If you make a single phone call.. ..I will send the entire Hyderabad to you.
Why do you need to come? - Because I need to kill a person.
Why do you take the trouble?
Tell me who he is and I will have him killed in an encounter.
No.
I must hack him to death in the open street.
"Okay, if you wish let it happen that way."
Before I finish my work and return to Warangal.. ..they should be no report of any activity in Hyderabad.
There should be no law and order.
"Okay, as you wish."
See you later.
"Look here DCP, for 24 hours.. ..ignore any incident that happens in the city."
- Ok.
"Hey, leave us."
Is it true that someone kidnapped her?
"No, that is not correct."
She twisted her ankle and was in hospital.
She will not give any interview now.
Go away.
"My boy, have you come?!"
How dare you stare at my brother?!
For this criminal?
Criminal?!
"Not he, you all are criminals... ...who are stopping him from being a good person."
You are forcing him to be evil.
Go and make him good as you want.
Go away... go... get lost.
You are dead for us. you are dead.
"Yes, go away with him."
No one will stop you.
"Yes, I'll go away."
Right now.
"Let's go, Kishna."
"No, Radha."
I'll not take you away in this way.
Mother!
"Mother, if I wanted to elope with Radha I'd have done that 2 years before."
But now I'll take her away with respect and self-esteem.
Self-esteem!
Cultured people are self-esteemed... ...not some dirty blood.
Because I recognize dirty blood as goons.
Father!
"I'm sorry, I respected you."
You are not even worth for this respect.
Because my parents were poor... ...but they were very rich by hearts.
They knew to respect their guest even if he's their enemy.
"Kishan, I beg of you."
"Please, go away."
Go away!
- I'm going.
But he has blamed my blood by accusing my parents.
I'll never step in this house again.
What happened?
What happened?
"He's saying, there are broken idols of God on that land.. ..so it's become inauspicious."
The place has become cursed.
"- Oh, God!"
No one will buy this land.. ..that's the rumour in the market.
Nimish.
"100 years later, when people find.. ..idols of God under that land, the prices will shoot up by 4 times."
Four times.
And people will construct a temple there as well.
lf anyone wants the buy the land he can.. ..otherwise I care a damn.
What now?
I've an idea.
"What are you doing, Kanji?"
Suicide!
"Sister-in-law, suicide.."
Papa. - kahan kahan?
Leave me.
What are you doing?
- Papa..
I am not a coward.
I will file a case.
Have you lost it?
He's gone crazy.
You will file a case against an insurance company.. ..worth 3000 crores!
I'm sure there are many others like you.. ..who have filed a case against the insurance company.
There must be others like me who might have filed a case.. ..but no ever filed a case against your Kishen.
I...will...file a case against your God.
"What are you doing? "" Who controls this world? """
""" Who's that sitting high up in the sky? """
""" Why are You hiding behind the clouds? """
""" Why are You afraid of being seen? """
If I kill him now.. ..he will become a hero in her eyes.
He must not become a hero.
"Hey Godess Laxmi, daughter of ocean God."
Take the Arathi baby.
Why are you looking me like that?
I have really changed.
I promise.
Come here I will explain you.
I accept that I am a bad man.
But I am not a bad father.
Sit down.
For the first time in my life I worshiped the God.
I took one decision after I prayed to all the Gods.
To perform your marriage with Venkat.
You are not understanding me.
I am not against your love.
I just want to know one thing.
"What is the difference.. ..between me, who is useless and him?"
I dont have any job and neither does he.
I am spending my time in clubs and he in the petrol bunk.
I dont have any shame so I am running this family.. ..by borrowing money from others.
But he is very hotblooded.
What will he do?
How will he earn money and look after you?
The house owner does not understand your love.
He demands his rent every month.
"The milk man, the provision store owner.. ..no one will understand your love."
Every one demand money.
How will you manage?
Did I say anything wrong?
He is also trying for a job.
What is his fault if he failed?
What is this you are blowing out?
"Lado, have I turned epileptic?"
Why am I fizzing from the mouth?
Could it be that you made me take a bath with egg &amp;amp; gave me shampoo to eat?
"It is possible, I was in a hurry."
- What! !
"Not only my gun, even my brain hits right on target."
No one can cheat me.
"Because I, Zibago, if load people with money for loyalty. . ."
I even kill people for betrayal.
I've heard I will have to play with death again?
The fun lies only in this game.
You have to strike a deal of diamonds worth 100 million. . . in the swimming pool of Hotel Blue Diamond.
It will be done.
"But be careful, because this time, the police has information. . . that the diamonds have reached India."
"Mr. Zibago, I very well know how the police department functions."
You had to come at 1 1.
- Ask your daughter.
"She woke me up at 12, then how can I come at 1 1?"
Who asked you to run away with my daughter?
Where did I run?
I took her slowly by rickshaw.
I had to pay a fare of Rs.
7 0.
You still haven't paid me that money.
Why should I pay you?
Did you ask me and elope her?
Does any lover of the world . . . ask the girl's father when he is eloping his daughter?
It has become a routine with you.
You eat breakfast and come late to work.
Breakfast?
"Since I have married your daughter, I am eating grams."
It's good that you came.
Come over here.
"Ha Ni ah, the thing that you were talking about - the 'timing'"
The timing of the kiss
"I keep practicing this at home, but It seems there's a problem."
"""If you can forget me, try forgetting me."" this is 4.3 seconds..."
"During that time, what if Hae Ra leaves before then."
You'll have to do it before she leaves.
"Of course, I have to do it before she leaves."
"But you see, that timing doesn't really work out."
"Oh, well, what if you were... stand right here for me."
EH?!
"No, I don't want to"
"I did it for you that day, what's the need to do it again?"
"Please, do it for me."
I'll do it instead.
"Ok, then you do it."
Stand right here.
It worked well for Seung Jo.
"When I put my hand like this, the head that was facing down, tilt it up ."
If you can forget me...
"You saw that just now, right?"
The timing wasn't right
"Before the conversation is over, he already came it."
"It's too long, this 4.3 seconds."
"Sunbae, do you want to try it holding a racquet?"
"When you hold a racket, you turn into a completely different person."
"Confidence, and burning eyes."
Hae Ra!
Oh my god!
You startled me
"Oh, what do we do"
Oh -- oh my G-d.
What does that even mean?
She's in stage four.
"Legally, they quarantine you at stage five."
"The doctor said she shouldn't be using public restrooms, eating with others, or in the proximity of the disabled."
(TWEET!)
They have it wrong.
Maybe she has partial brain damage?
A unique strain of Tourettes?
There is no way Mom is an Obnoxious Bitch.
"Wake up, Jenna!"
We have to face this now.
There's gotta be something they can do.
What are the options?
Can -- Can she get surgery?
The doctor said there's not a surgeon in the country that would take that risk.
The procedure would kill her?
"No, the surgeon would."
Doctors say she's the most Obnoxious Bitch they've ever seen.
Is she going to die?
Not soon enough.
Those two are my daughters right there.
The one on the right I almost aborted.
"The one on the left has got G-d-knows-what swimmin"" in there."
I -- I need to call Steve.
"Oh, no!"
You cannot call Steve.
Why?
It runs in families.
They say it skips a generation.
You could be carrying an Obnoxious Bitch right now.
Oh!
Sorry.
I gotta tell it where to do this on the negative one.
Sorry.
There we go.
"So I put down a C2, look at that. . See that?"
"So, what Spy's powerful per-say boom, boom, boom."
Zero.
"Boom, boom, boom."
Zero.
"Boom, boom, zero."
Got it.
"Now, the other one is interesting, cuz it's up here, and it's Up this, it's this one here."
For the zero set.
"So, it's like P2, but just shifted up by one."
Okay?
So I could take this E2 vector and just shift it all.
Okay.
Which I'm going to do.
Alright.
"And then for the, but, but first let's build the occasional, the 0's with the occasional one."
So let's make a vector called P4.
Which will be just a bunch of zeroes.
"And now what I'm do on this one, is put an occasional one, so E4."
Just like this guy.
Equals one.
"So now, there's the occasional one, there's the occasional zero."
"And I put this E4, actually this one here, interestingly enough."
"And, we won't have time to talk about everything yet."
"But, I'll show you where it goes, it actually goes over there."
Occasional one.
Now the thing is when I put this one over here I have to shift it by one.
This one here is shifted down.
I have had enough of doctors and hospitals..
"I certainly hope God doesn't get rid of them, but... ..I don't have the strength to see them.."
I don't know what to do.
"Don't worry about me, I will be fine."
You take care of your son.
- Save my Mustafa from all this.
"- God, look at this!"
"You don't have any strength in your limbs or tongue, but you are still nagging at me!"
Seher...
Take your lady to her room so she can rest..
I know what I need to do.
"I know what I need to do, as well, Duriye!"
Go to your room and lie down!
Seher!
"God, give me patience!!!!"
"Are you happy, Ms. Narin?"
Asiye?
We went to see Mustafa a little bit ago...
"But, he didn't see us."
"Do you know, my husband, a mountain of a man, has become almost vegetative?"
"You will celebrate, now!"
"Our new work place is here, Pasa."
"Ah, Doctor?"
Isn't this the place where we had the situation with the picnic?
"Yes, it is."
"If we can provide not just for the farmers, but for the social needs of the community, then we will have won, Pasa."
Yes...
"Actually, a astro turf would be great here."
Really... no...
"No, that won't be enough for you!"
"For you, hopefully, we will build an Olympic stadium."
It will be the Ali Olympic Stadium.
Pictures come out incredibly well.
I want to use this for Jong Up's album cover.
This is the puppy from a little while ago.
The states sure do seem really good.
None
He's walking a dog bigger than himself.
Good.
The sunlight is definitely working it.
The sunlight is making me look 150% better.
"Right now, the sun is really high up."
I think I'll get to film when the sun's about to set.
I can tell you one thing.
My character's concept is to read a book while waiting for someone.
It doesn't really match my personality.
That's my concept for the shoot.
Let's go for it!
"Stand there, just stand there."
Stand!
Come this way a little bit.
That's not it.
I don't know how to use the camera.
This is just all picturesque.
I'm a celebrity but I don't like to get dressed up.
Usually...
I don't like wearing make-up I don't like putting on hairspray.
I don't like fancy clothing either...
I don't think I'm meant to be a celebrity.
None
I don't think dressing up is all that nice.
I'm not a foxy guy.
I'm more like a bear.
Nice.
Nah.
What if I just spruce up your... duds for you a little bit?
"Okay, sure."
Why not?
Since you're up for it and all.
Just don't make them too... froufrou-y.
Deal!
Look out below!
Sorry.
New trick.
Didn't quite work.
Idea!
"I'll make you an outfit for the Gala too, Rainbow Dash."
Outfit for the what now?
I'll make one for you and you and all of you.
Oh!
And of course Pinkie and Fluttershy too.
"Oh, and when I'm done, we can hold our very own fashion show!"
What a great idea!
If you're sure you can handle it.
"Oh, it'll be a little bit of work, but it will be a wonderful boost for my business."
"Plus, fun!"
"Oh, I love fun things!"
Then it's settled.
We'll have a fashion show starring us.
"So all you have to do is make a different, stunning, original... ...amazing outfit for one, two, three, four, five... plus yourself, six ponies?"
And lickety split?
"Oh, Applejack."
You make it sound as if it's going to be hard.
"Thread by thread, stitching it together"
Twilight's dress Cutting out the pattern snip by snip
Making sure the fabric folds nicely
Bite its throat and suck up the blood.
"Suck up the blood, and you will be powerful."
"I heard that you've been wearing a veil, not letting anyone to see your face."
"If someone sees you, you'll either kill him or marry him;"
Is that true?
Yes.
Great.
"Now, remove the veil, and let me have a look."
"Hurry, if you don't,"
I'll strip you naked.
You're the first man who has seen my face.
"I could only marry you, since I won't kill you."
You're my husband.
So pretty.
"After I've killed him, and you can be a merry widow."
You saw that?
"If you dare to touch me, he'll kill you."
Who cares!
The Red Python is dead
Who killed it and sucked up all its blood?
I did.
Great.
The Red Python lives in the hills.
"It feeds on ginseng, and the deer antlers."
"After thousands of years, its colour has turned red."
"Whoever drinks its blood, exercises internally, and he will acquire ""Red Dragon Soul"" style."
This is good news.
I know martial arts.
What are you laughing at?
"The ""Red Dragon Soul"" won't hurt me."
All I have to do is suck up your blood.
Then I'll be invincible.
"I'm sorry to have offended you, please forgive us."
Sorry.
Let's go.
"Old man, do you know what Xiang Yaocha is?"
What did you hit me for?
"Who are you, kid?"
Don't you have any manners?
How dare you call Miss Mu by her nickname?
You want to get yourself killed?
"Old man, what's going on?"
"Lucky for you that you've met me, or you'll die."
I don't understand.
"Let me tell you,"
"Xiang Yaocha is the alias of Mu Wanqing, a martial arts expert of great reputation."
"Oh, so it's a person!"
"She's as pretty as a peony, she is ruthless, can be quite scary, that's why she's also known as Xiang Yaocha."
Where does she live?
A deserted valley ten miles away.
"There have been many who went there, but none of them return."
Is she a very good host?
"No, she killed them all, peeled off their skin to block the sun."
Please sit down.
"What would you like to eat, master?"
Just a few dishes.
Right away.
Should I go or not?
"If I don't, then Miss Zhong's life is in danger."
"If I do, she might skin me alive to block the sun."
Difficult decision.
"I wanted to rush over, and kill that bitch, Xiang Yaocha."
"Be careful,"
"I heard her ""Bone cutting sword"" is lethal."
And her fiancé isn't  happy with this at all.
His mother is being a bitch about it as well.
- I'm really sorry about it.
"- It's okay, thank you."
"- Thank you, usta."
- Take your share and let us part ways.
- Thank you for everything.
- You're welcome.
"Don't let anyone inside, son."
"How can I not, abla?"
They say they are customers.
- They're camping outside.
- Don't answer their questions.
- Come let's wash your face.
- I tell them I don't know anything... ... and I don't even know you.
"It makes the other shops uneasy, too."
I understand.
We'll talk to Kadir Bey first and then see what we can do about it.
You close to door.
"And tell anyone who comes, we're closed today."
"Okay, abla."
- The shop is swarmed with the reporters.
- What do we do?
It's a public restaurant.
"You can't say ""the reporters can't come in""."
"- But they have no rights to bother you, of course."
- But that's what they exactly do.
"- They are getting to our nerves, aren't they?"
- I'm most concerned about the Yaşarans.
I fear that they'll send someone to make a scene... ... in front of the cameras and we won't be able to prevent that.
"Abla, can you answer it please."
"Hello, Sinem."
"OK, so that means that P and Q are equidistant from this"
"line, so that means that this distance is equal to this distance."
"When they say P and Q are symmetric around AB, you can almost pretend like AB's a mirror right here, and P and Q are the mirror images of each other."
Good enough.
And then it also says points Q and R are symmetric around line CD.
So we also know that this distance is equal to this distance.
Good enough.
What is the length of PR?
This is fascinating.
So let's say that this length right here-- let me do it in yellow-- this length is x.
Then what is this green length going to be?
This green length right here is going to be 4 minus x.
How did I know it was 4 minus x?
"Well, this distance up here is 4."
So this is x.
This is 4 minus x.
"Well, then this distance right here is also going to be 4 minus x."
"And if this yellow distance is x, then we also know that this distance is x."
"So the distance from P to R is going to be the sum of all of these, right? x plus x plus 4 minus x plus 4 minus x."
And I think you see where this is going.
It's x plus x plus 4 minus x plus 4 minus x.
"These x's all cancel out, right?"
2x minus 2x.
And we're just left with 8.
And that's our answer.
B.
And you could've tried it out.
"You could have assumed Q was right in the middle, and it would have worked out the same, but you know for sure that the answer is 8."
Next problem.
Image clear.
Invert.
I don't know if I'll have time for this.
I have no idea.
Finch showers with his bathing suit on.
"I mean, uh--"
"As a matter of fact, it is true."
The guy's huge !
- Does he have a date for the prom yet ?
"- No, definitely not."
All right.
Thanks.
"Oh, man !"
"So I was thinking maybe you could give me some advice, brother to brother."
I thought you might know a trick or somethin' to make her--
- Orgasm ?
- Yeah.
- What's good here ?
- Try the spicy tuna hand roll.
- What ?
- How do you do that ?
"- Hey, never mind that."
"Listen, pay attention."
"Is that all that you're interested in, tryin' to get your girl into bed ?"
"No, it'd be good to be able to, you know, return the favor."
Be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
See that ?
That's good.
That's what I wanted to hear.
"Now, you qualify."
- Qualify for what ?
"- My man, you've just inherited the Bible."
"It originally started as a sex manual, this book that some guys brought back from Amsterdam."
And each year it got passed on to one East student who was worthy.
"Now, it's full of all sorts of stuff that guys have added over the years."
You will surely meet me.
Hello!
Hello!
"Law can reach far and wide, shekhar."
"By closing your eyes, don""t think everybody is blind."
"Law won""t spare you."
When did I beg for mercy from law? sP.. if you have any evidence then you can arrest me.
I have not come to arrest you.
I have come here as a friend.
Your wife is missing for the past 4 days.
"Maybe you don""t even know.. whether she is dead or alive."
"This is my personal matter, Rajesh!"
You have no right to interfere! - shut up!
You could stoop to this level.. I could have never imagined!
"You are my friend, Rajesh. l can""t raise my hands on you."
"Don""t put a stigma on friendship, shekhar!"
I am ashamed to call you my friend!
"The man who can betray his country.. ..how can he be anybody""s friend?"
There is a patriot who helps law in every step.
And you.. you have betrayed your country in every step! shame on such a friendship!
"I wish I could rip apart my heart and show it to you, Rajesh."
I wish I could rip apart my heart and show it to you!
Where are my goods?
Where are my goods?
- We want our goods!
You have got the gold!
We want the goods!
From where will we give it to you?
"- I don""t know anything! shut up!"
The police have blasted our den.
The gold perished in the fire!
Now how can we give you the goods? kaka sir..
All of you please go out.
I want to talk to my son.
"You too, go outside."
Sir!
- Please go.
I understand how it will be when death comes near.
I know I am not going to heavens.
Being a gangster I killed many people and now I am suffering.
You dont repeat my mistakes.
And dont ever hurt any woman.
I did that with Parvati.
I never told anybody that I am the father of her son Kasi.
Now I want to do justice to him.
I want to give half of my property to her son.
Promise me you will fulfill my wish.
Why dont you talk?
Will you do it?
Do you equate me with the son of your mistress ?
Your dad is very great.
He lived and died like a king.
He died like a dog.
I became home minister because of your father.
From now I will serve you as I used to serve your father.
I know I will have your support.
Just a phone call is enough for any work.
By the way 17 of our people are in central jail.
If you ever need them I will release then on parole.
I have an urgent meeting with collector.
Bye.
You stay here.
She is the your fathers mistress and he is her son.
"Mother, he is my brother and he will be with me from now."
- Who is Münir?- Don't play dumb!
You did it just to keep me away from that trial.
- Gather yourself !- I wrecked my home for you!
- God damn you.
"- Stop it, you will wake everyone up!"
Get your hands off me!You sold out jerk!
Damn you!
"- Shut up or I will --- Go on, hit me!"
- Damned bootlicker of the rapists.- What?!
God damn you.
You killed meto save the lives of three rapists !
"Wait, wait..."
What?Who the hell am I saving?
Explain it to me.
"Hay Allah, ya...Those bastards tricked me."
Motherf*ers!
Are you any different than them?
How could you do this to me?
I swear on anything you want me to.
I didn't know about it.
I asked him many times.He said it was a land lawsuit.
He didn't tell me the truth.
That pimp!
I would spit on his faceif I knew the truth.
And would this take away the guilt from you?
Whether you knew the truth or not... ... makes you less guilty?
But the stupidity is on me.
"I let you trick me again,although I knew what you were."
Despite what you put me throughI fell for you again.
I apologize so much.
You shot me down really bad this time.
I don't remember feeling more humiliated in my life.
"Like a pauper, even the heart has come on the street?"
Hey!
Stop!
What are you doing?
Apply the brakes!
So this trick was yours?
You are wasting my time.
"Forget the trick, think of my heart."
- Get lost!
"Or the paper heart burst today ; tomorrow, your heart will."
"You will say, how are you at fault."
This happens at this age.
One falls in love and intentions go wild.
It's all nonsense.
Know in how much tension I have come here today?
And you can only think of mischief.
You want to have fun in the garden.
"You are bad, even your heart is bad."
"I am leaving, good bye! "" What is the fault of the eyes? """
""" How is even the heart at fault? """
""" What happens at this age. . . """
""" I did just that """
""" Your face is like the moon, your body like dew """
""" There is mischief in the eyes, and rain in your hair """
""" Your grace has made me . . . """
""" even more crazy """
""" What is the fault of the eyes? """
""" Your love has made me so restless """
""" The truth is that even I have lost my heart now """
""" Before your love. . . """
""" I surrender """
""" What is the fault of the eyes? """
Your blood must be coursing the opposite way!
This interest business really kills you!
Look at how much weight you've lost!
"Since the ship has not yet set sail, that Yi Nok must still be free."
Yes.
He is furious about his ship not setting sail.
"If there are complications, it will make things difficult for us too."
- Who is doing this?
- I think they're going underwater.
"If the river freezes, we cannot leave!"
Why can't we stop them?
They are attacking our guards.
This cannot be just the parents of the girls.
So who can it be...?
It couldn't be...?
It must be the parents who are preventing the Choi Chul Joo's ship from setting sail.
Someone must be helping them.
I heard that Choi Chul Joo is planning on seizing them tonight.
Will he kill the girls?
Can she not see me?
Or does she think I cannot see her?
She may be involved with the girls' parents.
"If I don't do anything, she may fall into danger."
Did you just drop my merchandise?
It's dented here!
Pay me for it!
How much is it?
"Don't, Young Master!"
Weren't you looking at it because you wanted to buy it?
"Well, not really..."
Then?
Were you trying to avoid me?
Kerim.
Thank you.
Thank you.You did a lot of preparation since the morning.
It was tiring.But it was worth it.
Everything was great.
Yes.
I worked hard for it.
But you see.I didn't think about setting off fireworks.
"- Kerim, don't say this.- God damn him."
- I'll make him pay for this.- Kerim please...
It's obvious why he did it.Don't do anything please.
- Listen to me at least this once.- Don't you see how he provokes me.
Should I pretend that nothing happened?
"A wrong step you take with anger, may affect the whole lawsuit badly."
Please don't do somethingthat would put our case on danger.
- This is what he exactly wants.- He is doing it out of desperation.
"Because, he is so lonely, so helpless.He is well aware that he lost everything."
He is actually taking revenge of himself.He's trying to hurt himself.
I could very well help him get hurt...
He's showing off.
Trying to impress you.
He is nobody for meeven if he pulls down the stars from the sky.
You think he could impress me by showing off with the Yaşarans' money?
He is a poor soul.You don't need to be jealous of him.
"I am not jealous, Fatmagül."
I am afraid.
Bastards as low and dirty as them...
I am afraid of what they are can do.
I'm afraid to loose you.
Don't be.
I love you so much.
Good night.
"I identify it with my father, but not me."
I don't feel I demand respect.
You don't demand respect?
No.
Should you?
"As a matter of fact, I'd like more."
I'd like you to respect me more.
"Now you see, so you demand respect."
"Alright, yes."
"Yes, as a matter of fact if I could demand respect from you"
I would.
So do it!
Who's preventing you?
Except yourself.
'Cause if I feel I get myself out on the corner you're going to let me just drown.
You're not going to help me one bit.
And I know that I can't quite come up to standards with you.
What should I do when you're on the corner?
Encourage me to come out.
Ah.
You don't have enough...courage to come out by yourself.
You need somebody to pull a little damsel in distress out of her corner.
Yes!
"So anytime you want somebody to... ...pay attention to you, you crawl into a corner and wait until rescue comes."
"Yes, that's exactly what I'd like."
And this is what I call phony.
Pardon me?
This is what I call phony.
Why is it phony?
"I'm admitting to you what I am, and how is that a phony?"
"That is a phony, because --"
Oh!
I'm confident with that news.
My source is reliable.
Who is your source?
Tell us so we know.
You will have to spill it out in court anyway.
I'm lose my mind...
There's the sworn statement of the girl.
And there's the gendarme reports.
Easy now...
Save yourself to the prosecutor.
You can't fabricate news like that.
You'll publish a refutation.
- Okay...
- I'll get your newspaper shut down.
I'll sue both you and your source.
You may come in.
"Mustafa, ignore her son."
Madam.
Madam.
Your husband left these bags for you.
Can you imagine my uncle?
He got furious.
And Selim is a wreck...
That's a bummer...
Just when we thought the things were settling.
Won't you say something?
What do you want me to say?
Don't think we're safe just because only Selim's name's involved.
"If Münir Abi can't stop it, then all the newspapers will write about it."
"And when they dig deeper, they'll find out more."
We will all be screwed.
They'll find out about all of us.
Fatmagül doesn't want to talk to anybody today.
Not even you.
"Of course, that's what we thought as well."
Thank you very much.
Good bye sweetie.
She said you shouldn't leave home for a while.
It's bad if she says that too.
I don't get it though.
This was supposed to be a private case.
"Yet, everybody is talking about it."
You are right.
They are doing a great job twisting the facts and informing the media.
I'll go to the prosecution office and see what they can do about this.
"Also, I'll gave them a petition about what happened last night."
But it's not going to happen over night.
This'll take a while.
I just want to live my normal life.
"This is only the beginning, girl."
You can't go outside for a while.
You can't.
But what about Kerim?
And what about your job?
Your appointment with the doctor and all?
- That's enough.
- The moment you go outside... ... you'll have all those microphones in your face.
- Will you stop doing that?
- I wish... ...
"I wish they could go somewhere far away, for a few days."
But where.
That would be great actually.
What would be great?
"- Hey, abi."
"Everyone, in the bazaar, market, streets talking about it."
They know who cheated you.
"I am saying the painful truth, as your friend."
To make you bleed the poison out.
"She was smiling to you, but she loved someone else."
God saved you from the worst.
And they got lost.
Just leave it.
Who cares if the lawyer knows where they are.
They can go to hell.
You should focus on your own future.
Figure out what are you gonna do with your life.
But it's difficult to do it here.
- I know...
- It's best if you go away from this town.
You're a good seaman.
You can find a good job in a fine ship.
"- Of course, I can."
- Look for one that's going abroad.
Just sail away...
Some trips will take months.
I can't think of a better way for you to leave here.
"You'll make money, too."
You'll see a lot of countries.
You'll travel the world.
"And eventually, you will forget."
I will forget...
... that dark night...  ... and the smell of the ashes.
I will forget everything.
"Stop being stubborn, let's show your foot to a doctor."
At least eat your food.
You haven't eaten since yesterday.
"Well, I..."
Save it for your performance.
"Well, phony's not quite the right word, but it's more like a show off."
A show off?
-Like you know all the answers.
-Yeah.
"And I want you to be more human, and that doesn't seem very human to me."
To know all the answers is not very human?
"Yeah, and right away find out how"
"I'm kicking my feet, and why am I doing like this."
Why are you doing like that?
"Oh dear, I've got eyes."
I can see you kicking your feet.
I don't need a scientific computer to see that you're kicking your feet.
What's big about that?
You don't need to be wise to see that you're kicking your feet.
"I know, but it seems like you're trying to find some reason for it."
I don't.
It's your imagination.
"Okay, I know what I'd like from you."
Can I tell you what I'd like from you?
Yeah.
"I'd like you to be aware that I'm kicking my feet, and to be aware that I'm giggling when I'm really nervous, and accept it instead of putting me on the defense of having to explain it."
I don't want to have to explain why I'm doing these things.
Did I ask you to explain?
You said why am I?
Or what am I doing?
No --
"Well, what am I doing, you said."
"That's right, kicking your feet."
I didn't ask you to explain.
It's your imagination.
There's this great building nearby that the city is just gonna demolish and turn into a parking lot.
- But if we get enough signatures... - Signatures?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Go on.
I was saying...
Maybe we could get the city to donate the building to our cause.
"We would be able to pry 250 new beds, get people off the streets and into job training so they could buy rocket packs and go to the Moon and become florists."
"You're not really interested in the homeless, are you?"
"No, I am."
But they're a symptom.
"You're treating a symptom and the disease rages on, consumes the human race."
The fish rots from the head as they say.
So my thinking is why not cut off the head.
Of the human race?
It's not a perfect metaphor but I'm talking about an overhaul of the system.
Putting the power in different hands.
I'm all for that!
- This petition is about the building.
- I'd love to sign it.
Thank you!
"Sorry, I come on strong."
But you signed!
I don't wanna turn my back on a fellow laundering person.
"Well, if we can't stick together, I don't..."
I'll probably see you there.
"No, I will."
I...
She talked to me.
Why did she talk to me now?
Maybe I should...
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.
I have received the reward that I deserved.
"Now I won""t live in this house even for a moment!"
"This is too bad, boss! she shouldn""t have come here."

Gatsby?!

Tom:
"Come on, daisy."
Why candles?
"In two weeks, it'll be the longest day in the year."
Do you always watch
For the longest day in the year and then miss it?
I do.
We ought to plan something.
All right.

What do people plan?
Look at that.
"My little finger, it's all black and blue."
"You did that, tom."
"I know you didn't mean to,"
But that's what I get for marrying a brute of a man.
A great big hulking brute of a man.
"Oh, daisy, I hate that word, ""hulking."""
Even in kidding.
Hulking.
How do you know which measure of center best describes the data?
Let's see.
"We have the mean, the median, and the mode."
But how do you choose?
"In this lesson you will learn how to summarize the center of data with a single number  by examining the mean, median, and mode."
Let's start by remembering how to find the mode and median.
Here's the graph about how many books sixth graders  at Taylor Middle School read this summer.
The mode is the number that appears most often.
"So, in this data set, the mode is two."
"Put a zero, okay?"
Yeah.
"If you have a longer vector, than your diagonal is long."
Does it just take the first?
Yes.
[inaudible] it kills the excess.
"Yeah, remember, so these things over run over here."
And they run over here.
And it just goes this way.
Everything is lined up according to here.
"Oh so, so that bottom the negative diaginol the diagnol negative what ever it was it got rid of the first section of the vector."
Yeah right here.
So thinks about putting the vector down right here.
Says well okay you put the vector start it here go down and then come up again to show that it doesn't exist.
Okay and on the other side it gets rid of the n of the vector.
Yes.
Okay.
Or it could be actually I think that's wrong.
It's the other way.
It goes this way.
So.
"These guys, here. ."
Get stuff thrown out down here.
And this stuff up here gets thrown stuff up there.
Okay?
But same concept.
"So let's put this E2 in, cuz we just, created this vector with an occasional zero."
"And that guy goes right, here."
"If I do this,"
"Come on, come on."
Look at that.
Oop.
Kuzey's case will drop when the real killer is trialled.
And then he'll be free again.
"Okay, let's hope so."
And then I'll divorce and be free as well.
"Cemre, for God's sake don't live in vain hope."
- What hope?
- I'm saying I will divorce.
"I mean, for after you got divorced don't get hopes."
Look sweetie Güney is a black thorn between you two.
Nothing will change this reality.
Put this in your mind.
"Mom, what are you doing?!"
I'm giving them proper shape.
You can't send heart shaped cookies to jail.
You want to embarrass him?
"They will mock him, girl."
If they see them heart shaped like this.
"And you know Kuzey, how easy it is to push his buttons."
"See it looks nice, when it's plain and simple as well."
He can offer it to the other jailers as well.
"Okay, it seems you thought of everything."
"Well, we need a smart person in the house."
"Then, dear mom..."
You brush some eggs over those.
While I'm writing Kuzey a note.
What note are you talking about?
You've written a novel since last night.
"Please, I expect some respect to my privacy."
I didn't read your letter.
I just saw you writing it.
- Of course you didn't read...
- Why would I read it?
"- No, Your Honor."
- Very well.
"Excuse me, Your Honor... ...but the jury would like to make a recommendation... ...regarding the sentence."
- Objection.
"Sit down, counselor."
"It's only a recommendation, and I would like to hear it."
We recommend a sentence of time served.
I'll accept that.
"You are guilty, Father Moore."
And you are free to go.
- This court is dismissed.
- All rise.
Thank you.
"Well, you shocked us all."
Everyone at the firm sees this as another victory.
The archdiocese is pleased.
They feel the trial has raised public interest in the Church.
Have you seen the news?
"There's our priest, leaving the courthouse a free man... ...right next to you."
Just like James Van Hopper.
"All right, I'll say it."
I was wrong.
But I'm ready to make it right.
I'm offering you a full partnership in the firm.
Keep it.
Will you be able to return to your parish?
I can't go back.
Not now.
Once you've looked into the darkness... ...I think you carry it with you for the rest of your life.
What about you?
I believe you've seen the darkness too.
I don't know.
Have you forgotten that the whole palace is  not fond of having a half brother of the king around?
Don't do anything to give them a reason to make it an issue.
It's my rightful duty to see you twice a day.
"You still don't call me ""mother""."
It seem like you are spying on me.
You are making me very uncomfortable.
What do you mean by spying?
You still don't have a heir and have not gotten a concubine  either.
Others are saying I am making you this way.
I'm just sorry for the one who has already passed.
There isn't any other reason.
"Although I am your new mother,  you must understand that I still care for you."
"Then, please seek out for a new candidate for the queen's position."
I will start seeking a new queen.
Who's out there?
"My prince, please, come in."
"Oh, my prince."
How...How can you...How can you do this to me?
"Oh, my prince."
How...How can you...How can you do this to me?
It's very late.
Let's go inside first.
Didn't you promise me already?
"Yes, I have promised you."
But I could not go against palace instruction...
Why?
Did she say that she doesn't want me?
Please let's step inside first...
Tell her to come out.
Very well.
Tell her to come out.
Very well.
"You're going to lift one hand and one foot, tap."
"Then the other hand and the other foot, tap."
So see how the both come up and down at the same time?
I want you to try it.
OK ready?
Great job!
OK we're going to put one foot on the line here and put this foot on the carpet.
And we're going to put our hands on our hips and we're going to walk and put one foot in front of the other.
"OK we're going to come over and put one foot on the balance beam hands on our hips, and we're going to look at the target in front of us."
We're going to lift this foot behind us with our toe pointed towards the ground and you're going to stand on the balance beam on one leg until I tell you to stop.
OK?
Ready?
Begin.
Stop.
Good.
Thank you.
We're going to try this activity one more time.
I just want to make sure you keep that one leg up behind you and look at the target until I say stop.
OK?
Ready?
Begin.
Stop.
Thank you.
We're going to come over and we're going to bring this leg up behind us again with our hands on our hips and we're going to jump.
You're going to jump on the end of the line here until I say stop.
OK?
Ready?
Begin.
And stop.
You're going to catch it after it bounces once OK?
Like that.
You're going to catch the ball with two hands until I say stop.
"You could have dropped me by the subway, you didn't listen to me and got stuck in this traffic down the drain."
"Oh , don't prolong it.-You 'il miss your lesson."
I still have time.
I will take you to your neighborhood... and I will also see the place where you lived.
There is nothing to see...
"I mean, you can't look at things there as you look to an aquarium. .."
what sort of a man are you?
You take out your spines right away..
Do I want to look at your life as one looks an aquarium?
Is that the way you see me?
No... of course not..
Last night I told you my secrets.
"I put my head on your shoulder, I trusted your sincerity."
"Should I think "" I wonder if..."""
Okay i am sorry... - But you are are doing it always. .
"Whenever I want to come close to you, you push me away.."
Last night it happened the same way...
"Why do you hide yourself so much, I don't understand."
I mean what are you afraid of?
You put on your armor right away!
Why are you afraid?
What harm can I do to you?
Get out of the car then!
"Get out, if you don't want my friendship, don't look at my face from now on."
What's all this now?
"Ok, come on, let's go, I will show you every place, but you won't insist saying:"
"""I will see your home"""
Why can't I see your home?
Because I want to forget the way to it too!
Don't you miss your mom?
I will get out! &amp;gt; Okay!
There left..
"ln the last riots, I defended some innocent Hindus."
And my own people did this to me.
Father cannot walk.
But you want to fight.. ..with the One who created your entire community.
Will you flee?
I've no other option left.
I won't run.
"Look, I cannot fight your case in this condition.. ..but if the lawyers refuse to take up your case.. ..then according to the law you can defend your own case."
ls that possible?
"- Yes, there's a provision in the law."
lf you want I can prepare your legal notice.
"I'll be grateful to you, Hanif."
Hanif.
Do you believe in Allah?
Of course.
"God, Allah, they are all the same."
"So, I am fighting against Him."
"So, why are you helping me?"
You're not the only pleader.
Everyone does.
"Some pleads to Him, and some against Him."
Where do you want to send this notice?
I don't have his...
- Address.
No.
- Then.
The judge will dismiss your case in the first hearing.
"I mean, I don't have His address.. ..but of the places where people look for Him. "" You're our benefactor, our friend. """
""" So scare us. """
""" Why ruin our present, by telling us about an unknown future. """
""" You're our benefactor, our friend. """
""" Why ruin our present, by telling us about an unknown future. """
Just leave.
"Boss, honestly."
"If it was about a goon, we'd have managed."
This girl is very sharp.
We can't control her.
We're trying to explain her that we're the police officers...
And she's in the police custody for her wellbeing.
But she's not ready to believe us.
We've to keep her here for 18 days.
How will you manage?
It doesn't suit to tenderly girls like you.
You all are goons.
You've kidnapped me.
But I'm Radha Mathur.
I know how to tackle with goons like you.
"Never try to do that with me, is that clear?"
I beg of you
You can take away all my jewelries.
But please let me go.
"Look, you are misunderstanding us."
We're government servants.
We'll have to follow our senior's orders.
Then why don't you arrange for me to talk with my father?
What's all this?
This is the result of your father's enmity with a goon.
That goons is planning to kidnap you.
That's why our IG has ordered us to keep you... ...in our safe custody away from the city.
But how do I believe you?
This is a not a drama.
Do you have any evidence?
Wait for the 24 hours and you'll get the evidence.
That's a tape.
You're worse because you have the power but you won't use it!
You are the one that doesn't know how to protect.
I have forgotten too much.
I have to go to China in this ship to pay you back.
So that's why you agreed to such a high interest.
"Since my ship is not setting sail, you're the only one that's making money here."
Ten thousand yang a day.
Am I the only one that's benefitting from the ship not setting sail?
That is why I am going to put the bait out tonight.
"If the bait is out and we put out the trap, the mice will be caught!"
He's showing him the girls!
Does he suspect Gil Dong hyung?
"He must have gone along with him to not arouse suspicion, but how infuriating!"
We have to come out aggressively so that they will fear us.
But isn't this too much?
"You know this business well, don't you?"
"Be gentle, won't you?"
I'm scared I can't even look at them!
You will get your money only if the ship sets sail.
"If you stand here, you will have a nice view of all the mice."
Throw them in!
"Yes, sir!"
Help us!
Help us!
"We'll send them into the water, so they can have them back!"
Save us!
Please help us!
What is it?
You want to help them?
"If he does something, it's all over."
Then should he let them all die?
"When he gives the signal, we go."

Prelude to the battle.
"During the summer of 1861, the Union and Confederate Armies were both trying to control Missouri. By the second week of July 1861, the Union Army of the West commanded by Brigadier general Nathaniel Lyon, camped at Springfield, Missouri. In total, he had about 5,400 soldiers in his command."
"About 75 miles to the southwest of Springfield, the pro-Southern Missouri State Guard were camped. They were under the command of Major general Sterling Price. Price was joined by Confederate generals Benjamin McCulloch and Nicholas Bartlett Pearce. Combined their forces numbered about 12,000. In late July both forces started moving closer to together, each army trying to learn what they could about the other. There was a skirmish at Dug Springs, Missouri on August 2. This is near present-day Clever, Missouri. The Union forces won but this is when Lyon realized the Confederates had more than twice the forces he had. The Union forces retreated back to Springfield."
The battle.
"On August 9, 1861, Lyon marched his troops from Springfield to where the Confederates were now camped at Wilson Creek. His plan called for Colonel Franz Sigel to do a flanking maneuver on the Confederates and attack them from their rear. The rest of Lyon's forces would attack from the north."
"On August 10, Sigel's flanking maneuver surprised the Confederate army. It allowed the Union army an early advantage. The two armies fought fiercely in the fields and hills around Wilson's Creek. After six hours of fighting and numerous casualties on both sides, the Union forces withdrew. Siegel's attack had at first proved very successful, but fell apart when he mistook the Confederate 3rd Louisiana for federal troops and allowed them to get too close without being challenged."
"Three times the confederates attacked the Union line and failed to break through all three times. During the battle, Lyon was killed and Major Samuel D. Sturgis replaced him. Meanwhile, Sigel's mistake had cost him the advantage and his forces were routed. After the third attack at about 11:00 am, the Confederates withdrew. With his ammunition running low and his men exhausted he withdrew to Springfield. Too disorganized to follow, the Confederate army did not pursue. Technically, it was a victory for the Confederate Army since the Union Army left the field. However, it can be considered a victory for the Union since they still kept control of Missouri. The Confederate army called the battle of Wilson’s Creek, the Battle of “Oak Hill(s)”."

They are on the north and south of the Mont Saint-Michel. In the end, it settled to the south bed.

However, the administrative boundary which separates the two regions does not depend on the course of the river. The border is about six kilometres west of the mount."

Troina was one of the main parts of the Etna Line. It was defended by the 15th Panzer Grenadier Division commanded by Generalleutnant Eberhard Rodt."
It was also defended by four battalions of General di Divisione Giacomo Romano's 28 Infantry Division Aosta. The Axis forces were in deep trenches.

Formation.
"With his friend Tim Staffell, Brian May started a band called 1984 in the mid-1960s. The band broke up after a little bit and then May decided to make another band and teamed up with two other college students named Tim Staffell and Roger Taylor. They called themselves ""Smile"" with Roger Taylor on drums and vocals, Tim Staffell on vocals and bass and Brian May on guitar and vocals. They did a few hits such as ""April Lady"". Tim Staffell became friends with another college student, Farrokh Bulsara (to be later known as Freddie Mercury) and Farrokh became a big fan of Smile and encouraged them a lot. Later on, Tim left Smile to join Humpy Bongs and Farrokh Bulsara subsequently joined the band on vocals and piano in 1970. Then Farrokh came up with the name Queen, so they changed it from ""Smile"" to ""Queen"". They then started auditions for a new bassist. They were going through several bassists during this time and none of them stuck, only lasting for about a few minutes. None of the auditioners managed to suit the place of the new bassist, but finally in 1971, they settled on John Deacon. Queen's first album was released in 1973 and it was called ""Queen"" with songs such as ""Seven Seas of Rhye"" and ""Liar"". Farrokh Bulsara changed his name to Freddie Mercury after the lyrics ""Mother Mercury, look what they've done to me"" in ""My Fairy King"". Brian May has a degree in astrophysics."

History.
"The basic design of a corkscrew is been based on a tool called a gun worm. This was used by a to remove an unfired bullet from a musket's barrel. In the 1800s, many manufacturers that made gun worms also made corkscrews. The first patented corkscrew in England was by Samuel Henshall in 1795. In 1883 a flat, lever-style corkscrew called the waiter's friend was invented in Germany by Karl Wienke. It is commonly used in restaurants today."

Illness and death.
"In 2006, Borgnine was suffered kidney failure after he was taken to a medical center in Las Vegas."
"On the morning of July 8, 2012, Borgnine died at a hospital in Los Angeles, California of kidney failure at the age of 95. He is buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills, California."
Dušan Švento
"Dusan Svento (born 1 August 1985 in Ružomberok, Slovakia) is a Slovak football player now playing as a midfielder for F.C. Red Bull Salzburg in Austrias t-mobile Bundesliga and the Slovakia team."
Before he went to Salzburg he was playing for Slavia Praha in the Czech Gambrinus league (2005 - 2009). In the 2010/11 season he played even as left defender due to many injured defenders in the team.
His first match in the national team was on 15 August 2006 in a match against Malta. He scored his first goal for the team in his fourth match against Wales. The team qualified for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa but due to injuries he was not nominated for the squad.
Indian music
"There are lots of different varieties of Indian music. Most of the different types of music are similar to Western music types. Pop, classical, and folk are all included. India’s classical music has a history originating hundreds of years back and is still popular in India today, as religious inspiration or pure entertainment. Like Africa, India has many different ethnic groups, speaking their own languages, and having very distinct cultural traditions."
"The tal, or tala, is a repeating rhythm pattern usually played by the tabla. It usually has between six and sixteen beats. The beats are grouped into small sections in the pattern. The first note in the pattern is called a ‘sam’. It shows the beginnings and ends of improvisation, so it is often emphasized."
"The Raga is also a pattern, but it differs from Western scales or melodies. Ragas are sort of a mix of scales and melodies. They have particular ascending and descending patterns. Ragas are used to symbolize the time of day, season, mood or special occasion."
"A drone is a note that’s either held or repeated throughout a piece of music. It’s usually the tonic note, the starting note. Nowadays, the drone is played by an electrical box, but traditionally, it is played using the tanpura, which is also known as the Tambura."
"Improvisation is when the player does not have a prepared piece or an incomplete piece of music, and they make up notes as they play. Improvisation is recognized as a form of composition."
"There are 4 types of structure in Indian Music, Alap, Jhor, Jhala and Gat/Bandish. Each of these has different roles in a piece of Indian music."
Alap is the name for the opening part of a piece of classical music from North India. It is a type of melodic improvisation that includes a Raga in it. Only the singer and the drone can be heard at this point.
Jhor is a more elaborate version of the Raga that is included in the Alap. It forms the beginning of the performance. This comes after Alap and before Jhala.
Jhala indicates the fast-paced ending of the Raga. It is often distinguished by the overcoming of the melodic component by the rhythm.
"The Gat, or Bandish is a permanent composition set in a specific Raga. It is accompanied by the Tabla, a drone and melodic accompaniment by a sarangi , violin or harmonica."

École Polytechnique massacre
"The École Polytechnique Massacre, known also as the Montreal massacre was a school shooting on December 6, 1989. It took place at the École Polytechnique de Montréal, an engineering school and faculty that is affiliated with the Université de Montréal in Montreal, Quebec, Canada."
"Marc Lépine, a twenty-five year old, shot 28 people and killed 15 people as well as himself (suicide). The shooter targeted women in the attack and said that he was ""fighting feminism"" and called the women ""a bunch of feminists""."
The attack.
"He entered the building sometime at 4 p.m. on December 6, 1989 with a Ruger Mini-14 rifle and hunting knife. After he entered a second floor mechanical engineering class of about sixty students at about 5:10 p.m., he approached a student that was giving a presentation. He ordered that everyone stop what they were doing and both men and women to go to opposite sides of the classroom. Nobody moved at first, believing it to be a joke until he fired a shot into the ceiling. He killed six women and wounded three others there."
"After that, he moved to the second floor corridor and wounded three other students before he entered another room where he tried to shoot a female student twice but failed. He reloaded the gun in the emergency staircase and tried to enter the room that he left but the students locked the door. He attempted to unlock it with three gunshots but failed. He moved through the corridor where he shot wounded a student. He went to the financial services office and shot and killed a woman through the window of a door she had locked."
"He went down the stairs to the first floor cafeteria which had around a hundred people in it. He shot a woman standing near the kitchens and wounded another student. After hearing the gunshots, everyone scattered. He killed two more women after finding them hiding."

"Witty remarks may be intentionally cruel, and perhaps more ingenious than funny."
"A quip is an observation or saying that has some wit but perhaps descends into sarcasm, or otherwise is short of point; a witticism also suggests the diminutive. Repartee is the wit of the quick answer. (Wilde: ""I wish I'd said that."" Whistler: ""You will, Oscar, you will"".)"
Joss stick
"Joss sticks are a type of incense. They are traditionally burned before an Asian religious image, idol, buddha statue, or shrine. But some joss stick burning rituals (and the prayers that come with it) do not need to be done in front of religious images. They can be burned before anything without limits; like in front of a door, or open window as an offering. In modern days, the burning of joss sticks can be used for any reason, like making the smell of a room better or lighting fireworks up."

2004 Atlantic hurricane season
"The 2004 Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, 2004. It lasted until November 30. These dates usually mark the beginning an the end of the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. However, the 2004 season went past these actual limits slightly. For example, Tropical Storm Otto formed on the last day of the season and lasted two days into December. The season was above average in activity. It had fifteen named storms and one of the highest Accumulated Cyclone Energy totals ever recorded. The most season included storms called: Hurricane Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne."
Storms.
Hurricane Alex.
"Hurricane Alex formed on July 31 off the coast of South Carolina. Alex quickly strengthened into a category 2. On August 3, Hurricane Alex came within 10 miles of North Carolina. Hurricane Alex turned northeast and dissipated in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Because Hurricane Alex did not make landfall it only caused $2.4 million in damage and only 1 person was killed as a result of the hurricane."
Tropical Storm Bonnie.
Bonnie started as Tropical Depression Two while east of Barbados. Tropical Depression Two crossed the Windward Islands and died out shortly after. It became Tropical Depression Two again while it was south of Cuba. Tropical Storm Bonnie made landfall in the Florida Panhandle. Bonnie died out again after that. Bonnie left only about $1 million in damage and 4 deaths.
"For the official forecasts, see:"
Hurricane Charley.
"Hurricane Charley was a strong hurricane that strengthened very fast. Charley also made landfall further south then he was supposed to. Charley left $16.5 billion in damage and 35 deaths. The damage caused by Charley made it the second costliest storm in U.S. history, only to Hurricane Andrew. This beaten by four other storms within 4 years, it was beaten by Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Wilma, then Hurricane Ike. That makes Charley the fifth costliest storm in U.S. history."
"For the official forecasts, see the NHC's archive on Hurricane Charley."
Hurricane Danielle.
"Danielle was a category 2 hurricane of 2004. It started on August 13 in the far east Atlantic Ocean. The path took it over cooler waters, which caused Danielle to die on August 21."
"For the official forecasts, see the NHC's archive on Hurricane Danielle."
Tropical Storm Earl.
On August 13 Tropical Depression Five formed. On August 14 it became Tropical Storm Earl. Tropical Storm Earl passed south of Grenada and became a tropical wave. It was no longer a tropical storm. Later on the remains became Hurricane Frank in the Pacific Ocean. See also 2004 Pacific hurricane season for information on Earl after it crossed oceans.
Hurricane Frances.
Frances was one of the four hurricanes to have a major impact of the U.S. state of Florida. Frances made landfall near the same location Hurricane Jeanne would make landfall in about two weeks later. Frances caused about 101 tornadoes from Florida to Virginia. Frances killed 49 people and $12 billion in damage.
Hurricane Gaston.
"Mosel-Saar-Ruwer is a German wine-growing-region in the valleys of the rivers Moselle, Saar and Ruwer near Koblenz and Trier, Rhineland-Palatinate. It is famous for its wines of Riesling, Elbling and Müller-Thurgau grapes."
There are the following six sub-regions with 19 large vineyards:
Snail
A snail is a common name for a kind of mollusc. The term is used for a gastropod with a coiled shell. Their fossil records extends back into the Carboniferous period.
"Land snails and slugs breathe with a kind of lung. They used to be put together in a group, the Pulmonata. This was a well-known order in traditional taxonomy. However, the Pulmonata is polyphyletic. This means the same life-style evolved in a number of different lines. This is called convergent evolution. Therefore, the Pulmonata is no longer an official term in biological classification."
"The term ""snail"" is also sometimes used for aquatic snail-like gastropods, which usually have gills. Actually, most snail species are marine snails. There are more species of them, and they are far greater in numbers. Many kinds of snails can also be found in fresh water habitats."
Most land snails and slugs are herbivorous. Aquatic snails and slugs are usually omnivores or predatory carnivores.
"In many countries around the world, people eat snails as a delicacy. In France, snails are called ""escargots"", which is also the name of the dish. In French cuisine, the snails are cooked in salt water and then served with a garlic sauce."
The biggest snail is the giant African snail. Their foot is up to 35 cm long.
"The fastest snail is the ""Helix aspersa"". It can reach speeds up to 0.047 kmh."
There are known more than 43000 species of snails all over the world.
Body parts.
Shell.
"Snails are invertebrates, which are animals with no backbones. The shell on the snail helps protect it, and also reduces the loss of water by evaporation. Shells have many different shapes, sizes, and colors. Snails do not breathe through their mouths, instead they have a breathing hole under their shells."
Foot.
"A snails ""foot"" is a muscle which allows it to move slowly across the ground. The foot puts out ('exudes') slime, which eases the snail's movement, leaving a trail. Snails can absorb mineral nutrients through their foot by simply sitting on a rock."
Head.
The head is attached to the foot. On the head there are 15 mm stalks. At the end of the stalks are snail’s eyes.
Habitat.
"Snails are found all over the world. Generally speaking, land snails live in damp habitats. They live in caves and dark places. Snails can be found in dark places such as in a garden under plant's foliage leaves. Some species live in cold places like the Arctic and a few are found in warm places like beaches and deserts."
Food.
"Land snails eat vegetables and fruits, such as lettuce, carrots, cucumber and apples. Aquatic snails are often carnivorous. Snails use their radula to cut food. The radula is a hard, rough plate in the mouth. Radula teeth are like little pieces of sandpaper. They are good for cutting up plants and if the snail eats meat they are good for tearing the meat apart."
"Many animals eat snails. Fireflies, snakes, beetles, fish, insects, turtles and people eat snails too. To defend themselves, snails pull back into their shells."
Ruwer River
"The Ruwer is a river in Germany with a length of , a tributary of the Mosel River. The valley of the Ruwer is a part of the wine-growing region Mosel-Saar-Ruwer near Trier in Rhineland-Palatinate. It is famous for its Riesling wines."
"At the lower Ruwer valley are the villages Waldrach, Kasel, Mertesdorf, Eitelsbach and Ruwer."
Tributaries.
"Tributaries are Alkenbach, Altbach, Altweiherbach, Apfelbach, Avelbach, Bausbach, Benninger Bach, Bingelbach, Burg Heider Bach, Burkelsbach, Eitelsbach, Enterbach, Eschbach, Eselsbach, Flonterbach, Gimpelbach, Gondersbach, Grindelbach, Großbach, Hinzerter Bach, Kittelbach, Klinkbach, Kreidbach, Kundelbach, Labach, Lehbach, Misselbach, Moertschelbach, Mühlscheider Bach, Pehlbach, Rauruwer, Rimperterbach, Riveris, Rothbach, Siebenbornbach, Thielenbach, Waldbach, Waschbach, Weiherbach, Wenigbach, Wenzelbach and Weschbach."
Slug
"The parotoid gland is a skin gland on the back, neck and shoulder of toads and some frogs and salamanders. It's secretes has a substance that predators can smell. This smell will tell them that they are toxic animals. The substance, bufotoxin, acts as a nuerotoxin."
"Parotoid glands looks like warts on an amphibian skin. However, warts are grown by viral infections. Parotoid glands are normal and healthy parts of the animals that have them. Many people believe that touching a toad may cause warts. However, this is not true."
Mole salamander
"Mole salamanders are member of the genus ""Ambystoma"". They are a group of animals that live in North America. They are the only genus in the family Ambystomatidae. The Axolotl (""Ambystoma mexicanum"") is a popular exotic pet. They are also used in research. The Tiger Salamander (""Ambystoma tigrinum"") is an official amphibian of many US states. They are also sold as pets."
Rib
"A rib is a bone that forms a structure around the thorax of vertebrates. This is known as the rib cage. Humans have 24 ribs, 12 on each side."
"It is a common urban legend that male humans have one fewer pair of ribs than female humans. However, this is not true. This came from the Christian bible explaining the creation of Eve from the rib of Adam."
Taricha
"Taricha is a genus of newts. There are only three species and four subspecies. They are called western newts and Pacific newts. All newts are part of the family Salamandridae. The three species in this genus are California newt, the rough-skinned newt and the red bellied newt. They are all found on the west coast of the United States."
Species.
"Genus ""Taricha"" (Western Newts / Pacific Newts) - 3 species"
Lungless salamander
"The Plethodontidae is a family of lungless salamanders. They are the largest groups of salamanders. They probably evolved in North America, where there are 14 genera and about 150 species. Only one species is in Europe: it is ""Speleomantes"", the cave salamander."
"Most of them are terrestrial and are active in daytime. Lungless salamanders may communicate with their nose.p168 Slender salamanders are found in the Pacific Coast. They are sometimes called ""worm salamanders"". This is because they have slimmer (skinny) bodies than most salamanders.p182 If touched, slender salamanders will bounce on the ground and then run away."
Irritation
Irritation in biology is a state of inflammation or painful reaction to allergy or cell damage. The skin and the eyes may turn red.
Slender salamander
"Slender salamander is a common name given to lungless salamanders of the genus Batrachoseps. They are different from other lungless salamanders. They have four toes on each foot. They live in Oregon, California and Baja California in Mexico."
Species.
19 species are recognized in this genus:

Phase-shift keying
"Phase shift keying is a way of transmitting information. This is done by modulating the phase of a carrier wave. In such a system, the amplitude of the wave does not carry any information; all information is present in the phase of the signal. In many cases, this allows to better use the bandwidth available."
"If we think of a wave as a wiggly line, (like a sine wave), wiggling a specific number of times a second, and we can change at which part of the wiggle it is in. Say if it is at the top of its wiggle, and we immediately change it to the bottom of its wiggle, this is called a phase shift. We can use that change to carry information."
"By either changing or not changing the wave every time it gets to the top of its wiggle, we can send either ones or zeros. This is called Binary Phase Shift Keying. If we change the phase of the wave as it reaches the top, we can have this represent a 1. If we don't change it at the top, we can have this represent a 0. We can use a computer and a radio to turn text into a wave like this and then send it. A radio and a computer listening to this wave changing or not changing can figure out the original message being sent and turn it back into text."
"Binary Phase Shift Keying can be used to send computer data across radio waves quite efficiently. Certain Wireless LAN standards use Phase-shift keying, which they sometimes couple with Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing, to get higher data rates."
Pritzker Architecture Prize
"The Pritzker Architecture Prize is given each year by the Hyatt Foundation. It is for talented and significant architect who has created great projects throughout his or her life. Jay A. Pritzker and his wife Cindy began the award in 1979. The Pritzker family pays for the prize. It is the top prize in architecture, and it is often called the Nobel Prize of architecture. The country, race, religion or political ideas of the architect are not important. Winners get US$100,000 and a certificate. Winners receive a medal. The back of the medal has these words in Latin—""firmitas, utilitas, venustas"" (English: ""durability, utility, and beauty""). The idea comes from the Roman architect Vitruvius. Before 1987, a limited edition Henry Moore sculpture came with the prize money."
Selection.
"Martha Thorne has been the Executive Director since 2009. The director asks many people, including past winners, academics, critics and others involved in architecture to suggest possible winners. Any licensed architect can also apply for the prize before 1 November every year. In 1988 Gordon Bunshaft applied for the award himself and eventually won it. Five to nine jury members meet early the next year before announcing the winner in spring."
Winners.
"The first winner was Philip Johnson. The award was ""for 50 years of imagination and vitality"" shown by the many ""museums, theaters, libraries, houses, gardens and corporate structures"". The 2004 laureate Zaha Hadid was the first female prize winner. Ryūe Nishizawa became the youngest winner in 2010 at age 44. The most recent winner, in 2019, is Arata Isozaki."

Caroline Herschel
Caroline Herschel (16 March 1750 – 9 January 1848) was a German astronomer who spent most of her life in England. She was the first female astronomer that we know of.
"She was the first woman to receive a salary as a scientist. She was the first woman in England to hold a government position. She was the first woman to be awarded a Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1828), and to be named an Honorary Member of the Royal Astronomical Society (1835, with Mary Somerville). She was also named an honorary member of the Royal Irish Academy (1838). The King of Prussia presented her with a Gold Medal for Science on the occasion of her 96th birthday (1846)."
Early life.
"Caroline was born on March 16, 1750 in Hanover, Germany. She was encouraged by her father to get an education. She learnt geometry on her own. She had a hard life because people that she loved died. After her father's death, her brother William Herschel suggested she join him in England. She left Hanover for England on August 16, 1772, with her brother."
"In England, Caroline's neighbour taught her how to cook, market, and to speak English. This expanded her horizons. William encouraged her to be independent. She signed up to learn how to sing and to play the harpsichord. This led her to being a part of William’s musical shows in small gatherings. She and William discussed astronomy in their free time. This caused her interest to grow. Caroline began including English society in her everyday life. She eventually decided to devote her time to astronomy. This helped William: he needed Caroline’s talents in copying papers."
Astronomy.
"When they were in England, Caroline helped her brother in his scientific work. She helped him to discover Uranus with a six-foot telescope. William was credited with the discovery of Uranus. He was knighted because of his discovery, and she was his assistant. She recorded and completed tasks for him. Her calculations and record keeping were always accurate. They saved her brother a lot of time. Caroline often worked on discoveries of her own. She independently discovered the second companion of the Andromeda Galaxy (Messier 110; NGC 205) and another, new, nebula. She also discovered eight comets in 17861795."
"She reworked Flamsteed's ""Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters of Stars"". The result was published by the Royal Society in 1798 and contained an index of every observation of every star made by Flamsteed, a list of errata, and a list of more than 560 stars that had not been included. In 1825, Caroline donated the works of Flamsteed to the Royal Academy of Göttingen."
"She was the first woman to discover a comet. She discovered seven more comets between 1789 and 1797. The comet 35P/Herschel-Rigollet is named in her honor, as well as the lunar crater C. Herschel, and the planetoid (281) Lucretia. She also is famous for her work with her brother. She aided him in his studies. She reorganized John Flamsteed's ""British Catalogue"", which listed nearly 3,000 stars."
Herschel's brother died in 1822 and left her without his financial support. She returned to Hanover after his death and received her stipend from the British Royal Family. She also helped her brother's son finish his father's work.
Awards.
Caroline Herschel was awarded a gold medal for her works in science from the Royal Astronomical Society in 1828. She was made an honorary member at the Royal Astronomical Society ten years later. Herschel also received a similar award from the Royal Irish Academy. She was awarded the gold medal for science by the King of Prussia on her ninety-sixth birthday.
Legacy.
"Toward the end of Caroline's life, she arranged two-and-a-half thousand nebulae and star clusters into zones of similar polar distances. Her nephew, John Herschel, re-examined them systematically. The list was eventually enlarged and renamed the New General Catalogue. Many non-stellar objects are still identified by their NGC number."
"Herschel died on January 9, 1848 in Germany. She died at the age of 97. Herschel was never married."
"An asteroid was discovered in 1888. It was called Lucretia, Herschel's middle name. Herschel continued to have a legacy after her death because she discovered several comets."
Frank Sinatra Jr.
"Francis Wayne Sinatra (January 10, 1944 – March 16, 2016), professionally known as Frank Sinatra, Jr., was an American singer, songwriter, conductor and actor.

Cypripedioideae
"Lady's slipper orchids are the orchids in the subfamily Cypripedioideae. They are special because of their slipper-shaped pouches on their flowers. The pouch traps insects so that they must climb up past the modified stamens, where they get or give pollen, fertilizing the flower."
Some people think this subfamily should be different from the Orchidaceae as a family Cypripediaceae.
Pollination.
"A lady slipper orchid has a deep pocket that is actually a bee trap. When a bee crawls down into the flower to get the nectar, the pocket on the flower closes shut. Because of this, the bee is stuck for a while, wiggling and squirming, getting pollen all over itself."
"The bee finally finds a small opening near the top of the orchid, and it gets out so that it can get trapped inside another lady slipper, where it will give that pollen to the other lady slipper's stigma."
"The lady's slipper is also known in the United States of America as the ""moccasin flower"", because it looks like a shoe or moccasin."
Pandita Ramabai
"Pandita Ramabai (23 April 1858, Karnataka – 5 April 1922) was an Indian Christian who tried to change many things in India. A poet and scholar, she tried hard to improve (make better) the lives of women in India. She wrote many books, such as her popular ""The high"
"-Caste Indian Woman"", which showed the troubles of child wives and women in India."
Conversion.
"She was born in Gangamoola, in the Mala village, in Karkala Taluk, in the Karnataka State of India. Her father's name was Ananta Shastri. She lost her parents (Laxmi Bai) early. She travelled to Kolkata with her brother. There, she received (got) a Pandita and a Sarasvathi Award for her expertise in Sanskrit Poetry. Born in the home of an important scholar named Brahmin, Pandita Ramabai had more freedom than many Indian women. Her father taught her and her mother to read Sanskrit writing. She then began to study Christianity in India, and later in England. She decided that it was the best religion; that she should be a Christian. However, she had not yet received Jesus into her ""heart"". Ramabai later said,"
Life.
"Shortly after her ""true conversion"", Pandita Ramabai began a faith mission for the girls and widows of India. Pandita and her helpers began a school and prayed for what they needed every day. Wheta went to refugee camps and saved widows and girls from death or abuse."
"Soon she had over a thousand women and girls at the mission. Helping this many people during a time of great famine was very hard, but Pandita wrote in her autobiography,"
"Every day, Pandita Ramabai and her helpers taught the women to read and write, showed them cleanliness, and helped them prepare for a job. She also taught them about Jesus. She opened Ashrams at Pune, Mumbai. She established a Christian High school at Gulbarga, (now at Karnataka) and her daughter Manorama was the principal. Manorama studied in the United States and traveled to Australia."

"The Ruy Lopez is one of the most common and well-liked openings. There are many ways to play it. It has always been popular in master chess. White's idea is to try and undermine the center by attacking the knight with his bishop. However, White will not be always able to win a pawn immediately:"
"For this reason White usually plays a longer-term strategy, starting with:"
"Here, Black has two main options. Black can either play with an open center, with 5... Nxe4 or play a closed, positional game with 5... Be7. These openings are called the Open Ruy Lopez and the Closed Ruy Lopez."
Closed Variation.
The closed variation of the Ruy Lopez comes after these moves:
This line leads to a closed . White's idea will be to break open the center with d4. Play typically continues:
"These are the main moves for White. However, White can also play 7. h3 or 7. a4. These moves are played in order to avoid the Marshall Variation."

Highwayman
A highwayman was a type of robber who attacked people who were travelling. They were common in the British Isles from the time of Elizabeth I to the 1800s. Highwaymen rode on horses. They were thought to be socially superior to footpads (who robbed on foot).
"Some highwaymen robbed alone but others worked in gangs. They often targeted coaches because they did not have much defence, They stole money, jewellery and other valuable items. The penalty for robbery with violence was execution by hanging. The 17th century highwayman James Hind was hanged, drawn and quartered. As a supporter of King Charles, the Protectorate charged him with treason."
"One of the most famous highwaymen was Dick Turpin, who was hanged for his crimes in 1739. The Australian bushranger Ben Hall was said to be one too."

Matsya
"Hindus believe that the Matsya was the first important avatar of Vishnu. As the Matsya avatar, Vishnu took the form of a big fish. Sometimes, it is said that he took the form of a half-man and half-fish. There is a story about this in Hindu scriptures. The story tells about a demon (an asura). That asura was very wicked. He snatched the Vedas, the holy books of the Hindus, and went deep inside the sea. At this point, Vishnu changed his form. He became a ""matsya"", that is, a fish. He entered the sea and brought back the Vedas. He gave the Vedas to Manu. The Hindu scriptures say that Manu was the first man in the world. He may be compared with Noah or Adam."
Kurma
"Kurma is an avatar in the Hindu religion. Hindus believe that Vishnu, an important god of Hinduism, had several forms, or avatars, and the second important avatar is called the Kurma avatar. In this avatar, Vishnu took the form of a kurma to help the devtas and asuras to churn the Kshira Sagara, to gain amrita. This avatar took the Mount Mandaar on his back and helped the mount to churn the ocean. Kurma is a Sanskrit language word that means a tortoise. As a kurma, Vishnu is the symbol of strength and stability."
Varaha
"Hindus believe that Vishnu had many important Avatars, and the Varaha avatar was the third avatar of Vishnu. In this avatar, Vishnu took the form of a black varaha. Varaha is a Sanskrit language word that means a boar. The Hindu scriptures tell a story about this avatar. There was a daitya (a demon) named Hiranyaksha. He threw the Earth (called Prithivi by the Hindus) into the waters of the ocean. The earth was about to sink in the ocean. At this point, Vishnu took the form of a black boar. He entered the water and carried the earth on its body and brought the earth safely to where it should be. Thus, Vishnu as a varaha saved the earth from being destroyed."

Wild boar
"The wild boar (""Sus scrofa"") belongs to the family of the real pig (Suidae) from the order of artiodactyls. They live today in almost every part of the world, even many countries that are not their natural habitats."
"The wild boar is native to Eurasia and North Africa. Wild boars are omnivorous and easily adapt to changes. They were hunted in Europe from long ago for many of their body parts, and were shown in the mythology of many ancient civilizations. Greek, Phoenician, and Persian mythology showed them as fierce, sometimes evil, while others showed them as brave, powerful animals. Again, others saw them as parasitic. Even today many people see wild boars very differently."
"The hair of the boar was often used when making the toothbrush until the 1930s. The hair for the bristles usually came from the neck area of the boar. The brushes were popular because the bristles were soft. However, this was not the best material for oral hygiene because the hairs dried slowly and usually held bacteria."

Nurse
A nurse is a person who is trained to give care to people who are sick or injured. Nurses work with doctors and other health care workers to make patients well and to keep them fit and healthy. Nurses also help with end-of-life needs and assist other family members with grieving.
"Nursing is a profession, like a doctor, but training for a nurse is different in how long a person must train and what kind of training they need. In some places, nurses may train for three to five years or more before they get a license as a nurse."
"Nurses work in many places. Nurses work in hospitals, in doctor's offices, and in the community, and they even visit people at home if they can not get out."
"Sometimes people decide to become nurses rather than doctors, because the nurses will be able to help patients directly, by talking to them, doing things they need, carefully watching that nothing goes wrong, and then seeing them as they get better."
"Like doctors, nurses can choose what work they do. Some nurses train and work to help during surgery. Some nurses train to help people understand health problems like nutrition (what to eat), and disease (what can make people sick). Nurses can do many different jobs to help people."
Nurses are in demand because there are not enough nurses to handle hospital needs. Because of this shortage nurses will sometimes travel to another location to work for a few months in what is called travel nursing.
Titles.
"Registered Nurse in some countries like U.S is a term for an officially registered nurse. In hospitals where nurses wear uniforms with caps, an R.N. is recognizable by the fact that the cap has two black stripes."
Nursing in Australia.
"Nursing in Australia is done by ""Registered Nurses"" or ""Enrolled Nurses"". Both must complete education past high school. An Enrolled Nurse must complete a course of study between 12 and 18 months. Registered Nurses need to complete a Bachelor's degree."
Gender-neutral titles.
"Titles have changed because men as well as women can be nurses. It was, in most countries, a wholly female occupation. The titles were designed for females and have now been revised to be genderless. The exception to this is midwife, a term still used because it seems natural that a nurse helping a mother through childbirth should be a female. There are some males acting as midwives. The supervisory body for UK nursing is the Nursing and Midwifery Council."
Teams.
"Some medical and surgical groups operate as teams. This means that senior surgeons always operate with the same group of people, so reducing the risk of mistakes, and allowing juniors to learn and understand the individual cases."
"Also, moving around as a team allows specialist groups to serve more than one hospital. This is particularly useful when the amount of work in a speciality does not permit having a full team on site in each hospital."
Violent Femmes
"Violent Femmes is a rock group. They formed in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA in 1980."

"John Michael ""Ozzy"" Osbourne (born 3 December 1948) is an English heavy metal singer."
"Osbourne was born in Marston Green, England. He grew up in Aston, Birmingham, England. He has dyslexia. He was convicted of burglary when he was a teenager, for which he was fined. He was sent to prison for not paying the fine."
Personal life.

Kelvin
"The Kelvin scale (symbol: K) is the SI unit of temperature. It is named in honour of the physicist William Thomson, the first Lord Kelvin (1824–1907)."
0 degree Celsius = 273 kelvin
Definition.
"The Kelvin scale is defined by a specific relationship between the pressure of a gas and the temperature. This says that ""the pressure of the gas is directly proportional to the temperature in Kelvin"". This means that Kelvin is an absolute temperature scale, and scientists use this scale more than any other."
"The kelvin is a base SI unit of measurement, since 2018 defined by setting the fixed numerical value of the Boltzmann constant ""k"" to 1.380649×10−23 J⋅K−1."
"The temperature of the triple point of water is a hundredth of a degree Celsius above the freezing point, or 0.01 °C. The coldest possible temperature is called absolute zero and is equal to -273.15 degrees Celsius, or zero kelvin (0 K). By writing temperatures in kelvins one does not need to use negative numbers."
The absolute temperature scale was designed so that a change in temperature of 1 kelvin is equal to a change of 1 degree Celsius. This means that it is easy to convert a temperature from degrees Celsius to kelvin.
"It is important to notice that the name of this unit is simply ""kelvin"" (with a lowercase initial), not ""degree Kelvin"". In English, it undergoes normal plural inflection as ""kelvins"". For example, the boiling point of liquid nitrogen is 77 kelvins."
"In everyday use, the kelvin is most commonly used to measure very low or very high temperatures, such as the temperature of liquid nitrogen or the temperature of a light bulb filament."
Tourism
"Tourism means people traveling for fun and adventure . It includes activities such as sightseeing and camping. People who travel for fun are called ""tourists"". Places where many tourists stay are sometimes called ""resorts"". Places that people go to for tourism are called tourist destinations."
There are many reasons why people travel for fun:
The tourism industry.
The tourism industry has different parts. Some of these are:
Package tour operators can offer all these services to a group who will go together. This can be cheaper than paying for them separately.
Damage tourism can bring.
"Tourism can bring damage to the local area, and/or the tourists. Litter, scuba-diving and deforestation are problems for popular places such as St. Lucia, Hawaii and others. Scuba-diving can damage coral reefs which are home to hundreds of species of sea animals. Tourism can change culture when people learn each other's ways, and certain local traditions are being put aside for tourists."

"Marge can not find the recipe she is looking for, so when the family comes back home, they find her in the closet with her phone and laptop. Marge admits that she is the one who is addicted to devices. She signs the family up for a month at the Screen Addiction Rehab Center, a place to treat screen addictions."
"The next day, they get in to the center and find out it is a pleasant place. The owner, Dr. Lund, shows them around the place and what you can do. The family starts to recover, but they can not hold back for long. They find the workers all using computers and sending spam mail after stealing the patients' accounts. The family can not leave because they signed a non-disclosure contract which does not let them leave the center."
"At night, the family uses sign language to communicate with each other and escape the center. The next day, Dr. Lund is arrested for scamming."
Reception.
"Dennis Perkins of ""The A.V.

Ecgfrith of Northumbria
Ecgfrith (or Egfrith; –685 AD) was the King of Deira from 664 AD until 670 AD . When his father died he became King of Northumbria from 670 AD until his death. Ecgfrith ruled Northumbria when it was at the height of its power. His reign ended with his defeat at the Battle of Nechtansmere in which he died.
Early life.
"Ecgfrith was a younger son of King Oswiu of Northumbria and his wife Enfleda. She was the daughter of King Edwin of Northumbria. He was born . In 655 he was ten years old when Penda of Mercia took him hostage. In 660, at age fifteen, Ecgfrith was married to Etheldreda, the daughter of King Anna of East Anglia. She was the widow of the """" Tondberht of the South Gyrwas. Even though she had been married she had retained her virginity. After her marriage to Ecgfrith she refused to her second marriage and remained a virgin. She was encouraged by Bishop Wilfrid to remain . This caused friction between Ecgfrith and Bishop Wilfrid."
King of Northumbria.
"In 660, shortly after the death of his father, Ecgfrith became King of Northumbria. Ecgfrith asked Bishop Wilfrid to convince the queen the kingdom needed an heir. He paid the bishop in gold and a great many hides of land to convince her but Etheldreda would not change her mind. The marriage was dissolved before the end of 672. Ethelreda was allowed to become a nun. She retired to Coldingham Priory and a year later she became the abbess of Ely, which she had built herself. Ecgfrith married as his second wife Eormenburg. She and Bishop Wilfrid became bitter enemies."
"In 672 the Picts revolted and threw out the king that the Northumbrians had placed on the throne there. Ecgfrith sent his army into Pictland (Scotland) to punish them. He defeated the Picts and appointed his ealdorman Beornheth to rule over them. In 674 Wulfhere of Mercia and his allies attacked Northumbria. Wulfhere was trying to reclaim Lindsey. But Ecgfrith defeated Wulfhere and made him pay tribute. Wulfhere was succeeded as king of Mercia by his brother Aethelred in 675. Ecgfrith arranged for his sister Osthryth to marry Aethelred. But in 679 Aethelred defeated Ecgfrith in battle at the River Trent. To prevent a blood feud between the two royal families, Theodore, the Archbishop of Canterbury stepped in to prevent further bloodshed. He secured a truce between Northumbria and Mercia that lasted for 50 years. Ecgfrith next turned his attention to the Britons of Rheged. He drove them out of northern England and into Ireland. There they became mercenaries for the Irish kings and also began raiding the English coast. In 684 Ecgfrith led his armies against the kingdom of Brega, north of present day Dublin in Ireland. He won a victory and returned to Northumbria. At this point he may have become too confident. In 685 Ecgfrith again attacked the Picts but this time he was defeated and killed. On 20 May 685 his forces were drawn into an ambush at Nechtansmere near Forfar in Scotland. Ecgfrith and his second wife Eormenburg had no children. Ecgfrith was succeeded by his half-brother Aldfrith. Queen Eormenburg retired to Carlisle abby."
Ecgfrith and the Church.
"In 674 Ecgfrith had given Benedict Biscop, a Northumbrian nobleman, fifty hides of land at the mouth of the River Wear. This was to build the first of two great monasteries. In 682 King Ecgfrith gave another forty hides of land to Benedict for a second monastery. It was to be at the mouth of the River Trent at Jarrow. The two monasteries were administered as a single community and came to be called Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbeys. They became a center of learning and were where Bede wrote most of his works. Ecgfrith was at the dedication of Jarrow abbey in 685 about a month before his death."
"From 669 Bishop Wilfrid was directly involved in every gift of land and money to the Church by the Northumbrian king and queens. He became very powerful and rich in the process. In 671 he began building a great church which was financed by and confiscated British church lands. But after Queen Etheldreda retired to her abbey he lost most of his rich patronage. The new queen, Eormenburg, had no love of Wilfrid. Stephen of Ripon, the author of the eighth-century ""Vita Sancti Wilfrithi"" (""Life of Saint Wilfrid"") accused her of being jealous and not having the proper respect for the bishop. In 678 King Ecgfrith drove Bishop Wilfrid out of Northumbria. Bede gave no explanation for why Wilfrid was expelled, but made it clear his sympathies lay with the Bishop."

Eye colour
"Eye color is a visible character caused by two factors: the pigmentation of the eye's iris, and way light is scattered as it hits the top layer of the iris."
"The human eye is different from its nearest relative, the chimpanzee eye. The eyes of chimps and also gorillas are entirely brown. Humans have the white to their eyes. This difference is thought to be significant. In the apes, individuals do not usually look directly at other members of the family, but all the same they keep a close watch on what is going on with the family group. They tend to look out of the corners of their eyes, as if to keep the glance secret. Perhaps to them a direct look is aggressive. Jane Goodall used to be careful and avoid looking directly at the gorilla families in the bush. She would sit at a distance, appearing to nibble at grass and leaves, while making occasional glances at the gorilla family."
Physical cause.
"In humans, the pigment of the iris varies from light brown to black. This depends on the amount of melanin in the iris. The appearance of blue, green and hazel eyes result from the Rayleigh scattering of light in the iris. A similar process accounts for the blueness of the sky. Neither blue nor green pigments are ever present in the human iris or fluid. Eye colour is an example of structural colour which varies according to the lighting conditions, especially for lighter-coloured eyes."
"The brightly coloured eyes of many birds, reptiles and insects is caused by other pigments, such as pteridines, purines, and carotenoids."
Genetics.
"The view that blue eye colour is a simple recessive trait is incorrect. Two main gene loci code for the eye pigment: ""OCA2"" and ""HERC2"". They sit next to each other on chromosome 15. Mutations (SNPs) to these genes account for much of the variation seen in eye colour. ""OCA2"" mutations close to the 5′ regulatory region explain most human eye-color variation. An intron in ""HERC2"" contains the promoter region for ""OCA2"", affecting its expression."
"There are about 15 other genes which have some effect on eye colour inheritance. This is an effect called epistasis, and is not unusual."
Iris (eye)
"The iris (plural: irides or irises) is a thin, circular structure in the eye. It controls the diameter and size of the pupils."
"Eye colour is the colour of the iris. In humans, the iris may look green, blue, brown, hazel (a combination of light brown, green and gold), grey, violet, or even pink. In response to the amount of light exiting the eye, muscles attached to the iris expand or contract the pupil. The larger the pupil, the more light can enter the eye and reach the retina."

Origin.
"According to Bhavishya Purana, When Parshurama destroyed all the Kshatriyas in the land, the Brahmin priests, headed by Sage Vasishtha, kindled a sacrificial fire at Mount Abu and prayed that they be granted protection by being given some warriors.

The Four Agnivanshi clans are :
Parmar
Parmar are one of the four Agnivanshi Clans of the Rajputs. They are said to have been born out of a Sacrificial Fire-pit.
"The name Parmar means ‘one that strikes the enemy’, from Sanskrit ""para"" meaning ‘enemy’ + ""mara"" meaning ‘strike’."

Matthew Flinders
"The Couesnon, the Sée and the Sélune form part of the complex water system of the bay of Mont Saint-Michel. On one side, the tide brings lots of sediment. This causes large sandbars within the river. On the other side, the three rivers bring the sediment back to sea."
"In the 20th century, the Couesnon was made into a canal. This to reduced the erosion of its banks. In 1969, a dam was built. These changes, and the causeway linking Mont Saint-Michel to the mainland, have made mudflats. The French built a bridge to replace the causeway. It was finished in 2013. This helped to remove the silt."
"During spring tides, a tidal bore — a wave caused by the tide rising — can be seen going up the river."
The Couesnon flows through the following departments and towns:
Hydrology and water quality.
"In the summer, the water flow is typically in the range of . The pH has been measured at 8.26 (Hogan, 2006). The temperature of the water is 19 degrees Celsius in summer, in the area of the mouth. Water turbidity is moderate with a Secchi disc reading of 14 centimetres. Electrical conductivity at the mouth is high."

Schwarzschild radius
"The Schwarzschild radius (sometimes erroneously referred to as the gravitational radius), is the radius of a sphere that has certain properties: if all the mass of an object is compressed within this sphere, the escape speed from the surface of the sphere would equal the speed of light. An example of an object smaller than its Schwarzschild radius is a black hole. Once a stellar remnant collapses below this radius, light can no longer escape and the object is no longer visible. It is a characteristic radius associated with every quantity of mass. The ""Schwarzschild radius"" was named after the German astronomer Karl Schwarzschild who calculated this exact solution for the theory of general relativity in 1916."
This radius can be calculated using the equation:
formula_1
"where the gravitational constant G is N⋅m2/kg2, M is the mass of the object, and c is the speed of light which is 299,792,458 m/s."
Derivation.
"The Schwarzschild radius is found within the Schwarzschild metric, and originally was used to describe the gravitational field around a black hole, given the assumptions that it is spherical, non-rotating, without a magnetic field, and that the cosmological constant is zero; (it describes the path of a particle moving through this spacetime) however, this radius can be calculated for any object."

Most of the episodes involved the characters trying to survive a problem or trying to contact help."
Diaper
A diaper (or nappy) is a piece of clothing. It is worn by those who cannot control their urine or feces.
Diapers can be made of cloth (usually cotton) that can be washed and used again. They can also be disposable (put in the garbage after they are used up). Disposable diapers are usually made of plastic or man-made (artificial) fibers and contain chemicals that are very absorbent.
Diapers that can be washed must be folded in intricate ways (like origami) before being put on. With the disposable you must constantly buy new ones.
"Viewed as unpleasant by some, diapers are mostly used by children from birth until the child has learned to use a toilet. They are also used by older people. There are adult diapers for people with medical problems."
"In the United Kingdom, Australia and several other countries, a diaper is called a nappy."
"Sometimes adults who do not have medical problems also wear diapers. This can be for different reasons. Sometimes it is because they have a profession where they cannot always get to a bathroom, like astronauts. Some adults wear diapers for fun. This is usually a form of sexual pleasure, or for emotional reasons. These people are often called ""diaper-lovers"" or ""adult-babies."" The scientific term for liking to wear diapers is ""Diaper Fetishists."""

American Samoa
"American Samoa (; , ; also ' or ') is a territory of the United States. It is part of the Samoan Islands in the southern Pacific Ocean."
"In 1899, Germany and the U.S. divided the Samoan group of islands. The U.S. got the smaller group of islands on the east side. These islands had a good harbor near the capital city, Pago Pago. The western islands were run by Germany and then by New Zealand and are now the independent country Samoa."
"Officially, American Samoa is an ""unorganized"" territory. This means that the U.S. Congress has not passed an Organic Act. But the people who live in American Samoa rule themselves. Their constitution became effective on July 1, 1967."
"The capital of American Samoa is Pago Pago, but the seat of government is Fagatogo."
Citizenship.
"People who are born in American Samoa are called U.S. nationals, not U.S. citizens. This means they have some of the same rights as citizens but not all of them. Unlike people who are not Americans at all, American Samoans can go to any other part of the United States they want and live there for as long as they want. But they are not allowed to vote, to be on juries in court, to run for office, or to hold any job that the employee has to be a citizen to hold. For contrast, someone born in Puerto Rico or Guam is a citizen, so if they move to a state, they are allowed to vote in that state and in all federal elections."
"Some American Samoans like that they are not American citizens and others do not. Some American Samoans say that being nationals and not citizens makes it easier for them to keep the fa'a Samoa, the Samoan way of life. In 2019, three American Samoans living in Utah sued the U.S. government to say they are citizens. The judge agreed with them. The judge said that the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution says that anyone born in any part of the United States is a citizen, and that should mean American Samoans too. But the next day, he said they should not register to vote until after an appeal judge has seen the case."
"In 2016, the United States Supreme Court decided they did not want to look at a case about whether American Samoans are citizens."

Notes
Disgust
"On May 21, 1982, RKO General lost the license to broadcast and Channel 7 was taken over by New England Television on May 22. The channel was renamed WNEV-TV. New England Television bought a radio station known as WHDH in 1989, and in January, 1990, channel 7 was renamed WHDH-TV. On January 2, 1995, Channel 7 stopped showing CBS programs and began showing NBC programs. Before then, NBC programs were shown on WBZ-TV, Channel 4, which now shows CBS programs. The reason for this switch is because WBZ-TV's owners merged with the CBS network."
"In 1993, the station was sold to Sunbeam Television. In July, 2010, Channel 7 officially dropped the -TV from its name, becoming just WHDH."
"In 2017, the station stopped carrying NBC programming, losing the affiliation to WBTS-CD, and became an independent television station."

They emigrated to America in 1892 from Selz, Kutschurgan District, in the German-speaking area north of Odessa (now Odessa, Ukraine, but then in southwestern Russia). In North Dakota, the family lived on a homestead."
"Welk decided on a career in music and got his father to buy him an accordion from a mail order for $400 (equivalent to $ in ) He promised his father that he would work on the farm until he was 21, to pay his father back for the accordion. Any other money he earned during that time, by doing farmwork or performing, would go to his family."
Early career.
"On his 21st birthday, Welk left the family's farm to start his career in music. During the 1920s, he performed with the Luke Witkowski, Lincoln Boulds, and George T. Kelly bands before he started his own orchestra. He led big bands in North Dakota and eastern South Dakota. These included the Hotsy Totsy Boys and later the Honolulu Fruit Gum Orchestra. His band also played for radio station WNAX in Yankton, South Dakota. In 1927, he graduated from the MacPhail School of Music in Minneapolis, Minnesota."
"During the 1930s, Welk led a traveling big band that played dance tunes and ""sweet"" music. At first, the band traveled around the country by car. They were too poor to rent rooms, so they usually slept and changed clothes in their cars. At an engagement at the William Penn Hotel in Pittsburgh, a dancer said that Welk's band's sound was as ""light and bubbly as champagne,"" which is where the term ""Champagne Music"" came from. Welk described his band's sound, saying ""We still play music with the champagne style, which means light and rhythmic. We place the stress on melody; the chords are played pretty much the way the composer wrote them. We play with a steady beat so that dancers can follow it."""
"Welk's big band performed across the country but mostly at ballrooms and hotels in the Chicago and Milwaukee areas. In the early 1940s, the band started to play at the Trianon Ballroom in Chicago, where they played for 10 years. His orchestra also played at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City during the late 1940s. Welk recorded a version of Spade Cooley's ""Shame on You"" with Western artist Red Foley in 1945. The record (Decca 18698) was #4 on Billboard's September 15 ""Most Played Juke Box Folk Records"" listing. From 1949 through 1951, the band had its own national radio program on ABC."
Recordings.
"Sometimes, Welk's band made recordings in Richmond, Indiana and in Grafton, Wisconsin for the Gennett and Paramount companies. In November, 1928, he recorded for Gennett and in 1931, he recorded for Paramount. These records are very rare."
"From 1938 to 1940, he recorded in New York and Chicago for the Vocalion label. He started with Decca in 1941, and recorded for Mercury and Coral before starting with Dot in the early 1950s."
"In 1966, his orchestra recorded an album on the Ranwood Records label, with Jazz saxophonist Johnny Hodges, featuring a number of Jazz standards, including ""Someone to Watch Over Me"", ""Misty"" and ""Fantastic, That's You"". The album has been out of print for many years."
"""The Lawrence Welk Show""."
"In 1951, Welk moved to Los Angeles. The same year, he began hosting ""The Lawrence Welk Show"". It was broadcast from the Aragon Ballroom in Venice Beach. The show became a local hit and was picked up by ABC in June 1955."
"The show had a ""bubble machine."" Whenever the orchestra played a polka or waltz, Welk himself would dance with the band's female singer, called a ""Champagne Lady"" on the show. His first Champagne Lady was Jayne Walton Rosen (her real name was Dorothy Jayne Flanagan). Rocky Rockwell would usually sing novelty songs. Welk would also have one song each show where he would play an accordion solo."
"Welk's show would rarely play current music, except as a novelty. On the December 8, 1956 show, the show did play two current songs. They were ""Nuttin' for Christmas,"" and Elvis Presley's ""Don't Be Cruel."""
"The songs on the show were mostly popular music standards, polkas, and novelty songs. Welk often danced with women from the audience."
"Welk had very high quality musicians, including accordionist Myron Floren, concert violinist Dick Kesner, guitarist Buddy Merrill, and New Orleans Dixieland clarinetist Pete Fountain. He paid his regular band members very well, and it was common for them to stay with the band a long time. For example, Floren was the band's assistant conductor throughout the whole time the show was broadcast."
"The show didn't only play big-band era music. During the 1960s and 1970s, for example, the show played music that was originally by The Beatles, Burt Bacharach and Hal David, The Everly Brothers and Paul Williams and others, but in a style his older viewers would like. The show was originally in black and white. It changed to color in fall 1965."
"While it was on network television, ""The Lawrence Welk Show"" aired on ABC on Saturday nights at 9 p.m. (Eastern Time), but changed to 8:30 p.m. in fall 1963. From 1956 to 1959, it was also known as ""The Dodge Dancing Party"", because Welk was also hosting another show called ""Top Tunes and New Talent"" on Mondays. ABC canceled the show in 1971, but it continued on 250 stations across the country until 1982."
Personal life.
"Welk was married for 61 years, until he died, to Fern Renner (b. August 26, 1903, d. February 13, 2002). They had three children."

She controls the life and the death of the kings. She is the chief of the household and the guidance of the kings."
Relationship with the Queen Mother.
"According to beliefs, Goddess Yumjao Leima is the divine representation of the (Royal Mother) of the kingdom. All the powerful queen mothers were integrated into goddess Yumjao Leima after their death. Goddess Yumjao Leima herself was the all-time ruling Queen Mother. The most powerful person in a kingdom was always the Queen Mother - representation of Goddess Yumjao Leima. In ancient Kangleipak, cut off heads of the enemies from the war were offered to the goddess. The Meitei kings ruled the kingdom in the name of their Queen Mothers. Battles and wars were conducted in the name of the Queen Mothers. One example is that of an event recorded in the Cheitharol Kumbaba:"
Worship.
Goddess Yumjao Leima is prayed for the longevity of life of the King. The final rites and rituals dedicated to Her are generally performed by the maibas.

Laikhurembi
"Laikhurembi (, ) is a goddess in Meitei mythology and religion of Ancient Kangleipak (Antique Manipur). She is the goddess of justice, good counsel, divine law, order and secrecy. She is the chief Queen of God Thongaren ()."
She is the daughter of Lairen Humchouba. She is one of the divine incarnations of Leimarel Sidabi. She is one of the most important Umang Lais. Her pantheon is maintained particularly by the Taibungjam clan of Meitei ethnicity.
Etymology.
"In Meitei language (Manipuri language), the female first name ""Laikhurembi"" can be split up into three parts, ""Lai"", ""Khu"" and ""-rembi"". The Meitei language word ""Lai"" has multiple meanings. It may mean a god or a deity or a spirit or a disease or a picture or a painting in noun form. ""Lai"" may mean in adjective form in Meitei language. The Meitei language term ""Khu"" also has many meanings. It may mean """" or ""not "" in adjective form. It may mean a knee in noun form. It may mean ""to "" or ""to "" in verbal form. According to ""The History Of Manipur"" written by Wahengbam Ibohal, the words ""Lai"" and ""Khu"" are the names of tribes. The last part ""-rembi"" means chief, head or graceful in feminine form."
History and Origin.
"According to the Poireiton Khunthok, Laikhurembi () was the chief queen of Thongaren (). This book talks about her body in ways that show her personality. They say she had a wide mouth, which means she was loud or boastful. They say she had small breasts, which meant she used her heart less than she used her head; she was a thinking person and not a feeling person. They say she had sideways eyes, meaning she did not look at people straight on."
"Scholars think this queen may have had Asian ethnicity. Some scholars think Laikhurembi could come from a tribe that had both ""Lai"" and ""Khu"" people in it. Other scholars think ""Laikhurembi"" is just her title and not her name."
"Laikhurembi () is the daughter of Lai-ren Humchouba (, : Hoom Chao Hpa). In Meitei language (Manipuri language), ""Lai-ren"" means ""Chief of Lai"". In Meitei language, the word ""Lai"" has many meanings."
"Queen Laikhurembi was the first wife of King Thongaren (). Then king asked her to marry his younger brother, Poireiton, instead, because Poireiton's wife had died. Poireiton was beginning a journey to ""Tai Pang Pan"" and King Thongalel thought it would not be good for Poireiton to go without a wife. However, Laikhurembi did not want to go. Trees had already been planted to honor her as the King's wife. Instead of Laikhurembi, King Thongalel sent his second wife Leinaotabi to accompany her brother in law Poireiton as a wife."
Description.
"The Goddess Laikhurembi had special powers. She was ""Yungyatnaba"" (lit. ""erect and sharp"") which meant she could see objects accurately no matter how far away they were. She could look at a person and see who he or she truly was inside. When she made a judgement, she would announce her decision wisely, and people got the right rewards for what they had done (""things given in recognition of service, effort or achievement"")."
"No one could find the Goddess Laikhurembi unless she wanted them to find her. No matter how hard a person would look, she could hide and stay hidden."
"He went back to the Roman Catholic Church, which he left 1976 by protests, before he died."

Clement Attlee
"Clement Richard Attlee, 1st Earl Attlee (3 January 1883 – 8 October 1967) was a British politician. Prime Minister from 1945 to 1951, he was the first Labour prime minister with a majority in government, and was very important in the setting up of the welfare state.

Attlee died of pneumonia in 1967. He is buried in Westminster Abbey.
Early life and education.
"Attlee was born in Putney. Attlee was educated at Haileybury College. He graduated from University College, Oxford with a Second Class Honours BA in Modern History in 1904."
Career.
"Attlee began a career as a barrister after graduating from Oxford. This lasted for two years. He then worked as manager of Haileybury House in East London.

Bassoon
"The bassoon is the lowest of the four main instruments of the woodwind family. Like the oboe, it has a double reed. The reed is attached to a curved metal mouthpiece called a ""crook"" or ""bocal"" which is joined to the main part of the instrument. This consists of two parts called ‘bass joint’ and ‘wing joint’ (or ‘tenor joint’). These two are joined at the bottom by a U-shaped piece called the ‘boot’. At the top of the instrument is the ‘bell joint’. The instrument is quite heavy. Some players have a neckstrap around their neck to support the weight, but usually they use a seat strap that connects at the bottom of the boot and goes across the floor. The bassoonist, a person who plays a bassoon, then sits on that strap. The bassoon is held to the right side of the bassoonist and the top of the boot joint is usually level with the players hip. The bassoon, when played right, can sound very beautiful. The bassoon has one of the largest note ranges, going from low B flat to a high F on the top line of the treble clef. The bassoon can also play in tenor clef, but usually plays bass clef."
"Some bassoons have a white, ivory ring round the top of the bell joint. These are German bassoons (called ‘Heckel’). French bassoons (called ‘Buffet’) do not have this ring, and also sound quite different to German bassoons. Bassoons have keys to help the player to cover all the holes, but these keys do not use the Boehm fingering system like the other woodwind instruments. German bassoons use a system called the Heckel system, and French bassoons use the Buffet system."
"The Bassoon is usually seen as a comical instrument, however it provides a very important role in the orchestra. In fact, the Saxophone was invented to replace the Bassoon and Oboe, however, was rejected because it didn't sound the same in the orchestra."
Playing the bassoon.
"To play the bassoon, it is very important to have lots of breathing support. Like with the oboe, fast passages can be played using double tonguing (single tonguing is like saying “tu-tu-tu-tu-tu”, double tonguing is like saying “te-ke-te-ke-te-ke”). In most music, the bassoon will spend a lot of time playing a bass line, perhaps the same notes as the cello or tuba. It can sometimes sound quite amusing when playing an “um-cha-um-cha” accompaniment like in the “Dance of the Cygnets” from Tchaikovsky’s ""Swan Lake"". It can sound very tuneful and sad as in the second movement of Rimsky Korsakov’s ""Sheherazade"". Listen to the opening of Stravinsky’s ""Rite of Spring"" where it plays some quite high notes to fool people that it is the Cor anglais or the English Horn. Even a famous composer, Saint Saëns, did not know what the instrument was. Prokofiev uses the bassoon for grandfather’s tune in ""Peter and the Wolf"". Also, to play the bassoon, a player needs big hands because the bassoon's keys and holes are quite wide."
"The movie's musical score and songs are arrangements or adaptations of material from the 1890 ""Sleeping Beauty"" ballet by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. Buena Vista Distribution released the movie to theaters on November 11, 1959. It was the first animated movie to be photographed in the Technirama widescreen process. The movie was presented in Super Technirama 70 and 6-channel stereophonic sound in first-run engagements."
"The movie generated mixed reviews from critics. They thought the movie was slow-paced and lacked character development. ""Sleeping Beauty"" earned approximately $7.7 million in box office rentals. Its production costs totaled $6 million, making it the most expensive Disney movie to that date. The high production costs of the movie resulted in the company posting its first annual loss in a decade for fiscal year 1960, and many animators were laid off."

"Criticism was positive. Charles Eames of ""The New World"" wrote, ""The force and boldness of the conception and the high artistic skill, with which the writer's purpose is wrought out, are equally admirable."" Thomas Dunn English wrote in October 1845 that ""Ligeia"" was ""the most extraordinary, of its kind, of his productions""."
"In 1964, director Roger Corman adapted the story to a movie, ""The Tomb of Ligeia"", starring Vincent Price."
The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar
"""The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar"" is a short story by Edgar Allan Poe. It was first published in 1845. The tale tells of a dying, mesmerized man whose body disintegrates once the trance is lifted. Poe was inspired to write the tale after reading a description of an operation performed upon a mesmerized patient. The tale has a great deal of gore, leading to the speculation that Poe had studied medical texts. ""Valdemar"" has been adapted to the movies and to radio drama."
Plot.
"The narrator mesmerizes an ill friend, M. Valdemar. Valdemar reports first that he is dying and then that he is dead. The narrator leaves him in a mesmeric state for seven months. During this time Valdemar is without pulse, heartbeat, or breath. His skin is cold and pale. Finally, the narrator tries to wake him. Valdemar's swollen black tongue begs to be returned to sleep or to be fully wakened. He shouts ""dead! dead!"" repeatedly. The narrator takes Valdemar out of the trance and his body immediately disintegrates into a ""nearly liquid mass of loathsome—of detestable putrescence."""
Publication history.
"Poe was inspired to write ""Valdemar"" after reading a letter about an operation on a mesmerized patient. The tale was published in December 1845 in two different New York journals. One used the title ""The Facts in M. Valdemar's Case"". In England, the tale was published first as ""Mesmerism in Articulo Mortis"" and later as ""The Last Days of M. Valdemar""."
Style.
"Poe employs detailed descriptions and high levels of gore in ""Valdemar"". He may have studied medical texts. Valdemar's eyes at one point leak a ""profuse outflowing of a yellowish ichor"", for example. The tale's imagery is summed up in the final lines: ""...his whole frame at once — within the space of a single minute, or even less, shrunk—crumbled—absolutely rotted away beneath my hands. Upon the bed, before that whole company, there lay a nearly liquid mass of loathsome—of detestable putrescence."" The disgusting imagery probably inspired later fiction including that of H. P. Lovecraft. Those final lines make up one of the most powerfully effective moments in Poe's work, incorporating shock, disgust, and uneasiness into one moment. This ending shows that attempts to appropriate power over death will have hideous results and, therefore, ultimately will be unsuccessful."
Adaptations.
"Movie adaptations include a segment in Roger Corman's ""Tales of Terror"" (1962) and George A. Romero's ""Two Evil Eyes"" (1990). ""Edgar Allan Poe's Valdemar"" (2000) was a dramatic adaptation for National Public Radio."
"Genetic changes in bacteria might result in antibiotic resistance. They might be acquired through spontaneous mutations (vertical gene transfer) or through other bacteria passing their genes (horizontal gene transfer). Self-medications or improper medication use can result in the emergence of resistant bacteria. It is difficult to obtain new antibiotics, that is why researchers seek to improve existing ones, as well as working to discover new drugs."
Rosie the Riveter
"Rosie the Riveter is a cultural icon of the United States who appeared in a World War II propaganda poster titled ""We Can Do It!"". She is often used as a symbol of feminism. In 1944 a movie called ""Rosie the Riveter"" was released."
"Rosie the Riveter became associated with a real woman called Naomi Parker, who inspired the icon. Rosie the Riveter was named after Rosalind P. Walter."
In 1997 the Rosie the Riveter Memorial Committee was started.
Prince of Conti
"The title of Prince of Conti was an old title at the old French court. The prince held the prestigious rank of ""Prince of the blood"" at the court and was also entitled to the style of Serene Highness. The eldest son of the prince usually used the title of ""Prince of La Roche-sur-Yon"" and at other times used the title ""Count of La Marche"""
Marquess and Princes of Conti.
"""At his death, the title was not passed on, because of the lack of direct descendants. The title was bestowed in 1629 upon:"""
"""At his death, the title was not passed on, because of the lack of legitimate descendants."""
Randy Rhoads
"Randall William ""Randy"" Rhoads (December 6, 1956 – March 19, 1982) was an American heavy metal guitarist. He was best known for performing with Ozzy Osbourne and the band Quiet Riot."
Career.
Rhoads first formed a band with Kelly Garni called Little Women. Kevin DuBrow was recruited into the band and they changed their name to Quiet Riot. The band became popular by playing in clubs in Los Angeles. By late 1976 they were signed to CBS/Sony Records.
"Dana Strum contacted Rhoads to see if he was wanted to audition for Ozzy Osbourne's new band. He asked his mother if he should join Osbourne's band since he was still in Quiet Riot. She asked him if he would accept ""an offer like this one"" and Rhodes replied ""Of course!"""
"He went to audition in Osbourne's hotel room in Los Angeles with his guitar and a practice amplifier. As he started getting ready he was given the job. Osbourne was very drunk, and had fallen asleep during the audition. Rhoads remembered later, ""I just tuned up and did some riffs, and he said, 'You've got the gig'; I had the weirdest feeling, because I thought, 'You didn't even hear me yet'""."
"Rhoads flew to England on the November 27, 1979. He stayed with Osbourne, his wife at the time Thelma, and their two children. After a short while, Lee Kerslake joined the band, which was at the time called The Blizzard of Ozz. The band recorded their debut album ""Blizzard of Ozz"" which was released on September 20, 1980 and became a success. ""Diary of a Madman"", their second studio album, was recorded between February and March 1981. It was released on November 7, 1981."
Death.
"Rhoads died on March 19, 1982. He was touring with his band at the time. While driving in their tour bus, the band stopped in Leesburg, Florida, to fix the bus' air conditioner. Osbourne stayed asleep because he had been drinking heavily earlier in the evening. While stopped, their driver Andrew Aycock noticed an airstrip with small helicopters and planes. Aycock had previously worked as a commercial pilot. He decided to take a small Beechcraft F35 plane registered to a man named Mike Partin. He took it without Partin's permission. He took keyboardist Don Airey and tour manager Jake Duncan for a flight. He took Rhoads and makeup artist Rachel Youngblood on for the second flight. Aycock tried to fly the plane very low over their tour bus, where the other band members were sleeping. He made two close passes but caused an accident on the third one. One of the plane's wings had clipped the top of the tour bus. This broke the wing into two parts and sent the plane spiraling out of control. Both Rhoads and Youngblood were thrown out of the plane's windshield by the initial impact. While traveling at about , the plane crashed into a nearby garage. All three passengers were killed instantly. They were burned beyond recognition from the fire of the plane. The only person to witness the accident was keyboardist Don Airey."
The Net
"The Net is a 1995 American melodramatic thriller movie. It was released on July 28, 1995. The story is about a computer systems analyst, Angela Bennett, who becomes a victim of identity theft. She is also framed for murder. Sandra Bullock plays Angela Bennett."
"Reviews for ""The Net"" were very mixed. The movie, however, made over US$110 million worldwide. Roger Ebert gave the movie three out of four stars."
Iran–Contra affair
"The Iran-Contra affair was a scandal that happened from August 1985 to March 1987. The scandal involved the United States Government selling weapons to Iran in exchange for hostages and to fund the Nicaraguan Contras. It happened under President Ronald Reagan's government. When 1,500 missiles were shipped three hostages were released but those three hostages were soon replaced with three more hostages. Secretary of State George Shultz called it “a hostage Bazaar”"
Oliver North was tried in court for the affair because he took the blame instead of Reagan. The court found North to be not guilty.
"On March 4, 1987, Reagan himself apologized to the American people and said it was all his fault. George H. W. Bush later pardoned anyone who was involved in the affair."
"While President Ronald Reagan was a supporter of the Contra cause, the evidence is unclear as to whether he knew about the scandal."
"Altogether Southwest Alaska is 442,194 km² (170,732 mi²), slightly larger than California."
Demographics.
"Southwest Alaska had a population of about 53,000 people. This is less than 10% of all the people in Alaska. More than half of those people are Alaska Natives. About 121 towns and villages are in Southwest Alaska. A lot of them are very small and far away from other towns."
"Natives in Southwest Alaska are descended from different tribes, the Yupik, the Alutiiq, the Aleut and the Dena'ina Athabaskans."
"In modern times Alaska Natives are organized into corporations. The corporations have the job of speaking for the members. Four of the corporations are in Southwest Alaska, the Calista Corporation, the Bristol Bay Native Corporation, Koniag Incorporated, and the Aleut Corporation. Each one represents a different part of Southwest Alaska."
Economy.
"Most of the land in Southwest Alaska is owned by the Federal government, the State of Alaska, and the native corporations. There is not much of it that belongs to private persons."
"The economy in Southwest Alaska is based on three main things. Resource extraction, meaning the removal of natural things like wood, coal, or fish. Subsistence, meaning people who get their own food is another. The third is government spending."
"Fishing is important here. There are big boats that catch lots and lots of fish that end up in stores or in food made from fish. There are also lots of small boats where people fish for their own food or just for fun. A lot of the big boats are owned by people who don't live on Southwest Alaska. Kodiak and Unalaska are two of the most important fishing ports in the United States. They make a lot of money from catching salmon, trout, king crab, and halibut. Because so many of the big boats are owned by companies or people from outside Southwest Alaska most of the fish and the money they make from it does not stay in the area."
"Hunting and other tourism are some of the other important businesses in Southwest, but only for part of the year."
"There is also mining in Southwest Alaska. Most of the time they are looking for gold, platinum, or mercury. There is not a lot of mining but there are a lot of people who do not agree about it. One thing they don't agree on is the Pebble Mine, which would put a large open pit gold and copper mine near where a lot of the fish that are caught in Bristol Bay come from. Right now it is not allowed to drill for oil in Bristol Bay either, but some people in the government want to change that."
Wildlife.
"Southwest Alaska is one of the best places in the world to catch salmon. There are also lots of brown bears. They come to eat the salmon, as well as berries and other plants. Bear watching is a popular tourist attraction at Katmai National Park and Preserve. This area is also home to a number of caribou herds. More western Aleutian Islands have no mammals larger than a fox. In the summer, lots of birds fly up and make their nests on the tundra here. A lot of the Aleutian Islands have lots and lots of seabirds on them."
Transportation.
"There is no way to get to Southwest Alaska in a car. There are roads in the towns and some of them have roads going to another town, but there is not a road going into the area from anywhere else. Because of that people travel by boat or airplane in Southwest if they need to go a long way. The town of Bethel is a place where big boats will come from the ocean. When they get to Bethel their cargo is moved onto smaller boats that go up the rivers. There are many airports as well. Some of them are big enough that big jets can land there, but a lot of them are small. Snowmachines, also called Snowmobiles are used here a lot in the winter. When the rivers are frozen people use them like a road to drive to another town."
Deanna Durbin
"Edna Mae Durbin, known as Deanna Durbin (December 4, 1921 – April 17, 2013), was a Canadian actress and singer. She was in a number of musical movies in the 1930s and 1940s, singing standards and operatic arias. Her first movie was in 1936 with Judy Garland in ""Every Sunday"". She was born in Manitoba, Canada, 4 December 1921 but has lived near Paris since she married Charles David in 1950. Durbin's death was announced on April 30, 2013 in Paris, France from unknown causes, aged 91. According to her social security numbers, Durbin died on April 17."
Colony collapse disorder
"Colony collapse disorder (CCD) is an occurrence where worker bees from a beehive abruptly disappear. The exact cause of colony collapse disorder is unknown. However, chemicals, parasites, and ""Varroa"" mites have been proposed as factors contributing to colony collapse disorder."
"Early in 2013, the European Food Safety Authority issued a declaration that three specific neonicotinoid pesticides pose an acute risk to honeybees, and the European Commission (EC) proposed a two-year ban on them. David Goulson, who led one of the key 2012 studies at the University of Stirling said that the decision ""begs the question of what was going on when these chemicals were first approved."" The chemical manufacturer Bayer said it was ""ready to work with"" the EC and member states."
Jaime Pressly
"Jaime Pressly is an American model and actress. She played Joy Turner in NBC's sitcom ""My Name is Earl"". She has also starred in numerous motion pictures. The actress was born July 30, 1977, Kinston, North Carolina."
Boris Karloff
"Boris Karloff a.k.a. William Henry Pratt (November 23, 1887 – February 2, 1969), was an English actor."
Career.
"Born in London, England. His career began in silent movies. The Lightning Raider (1919), The Courage of Marge O'Doone (1920), The Woman Conquers (1922), The Greater Glory (1926), and The Devil's Chaplain (1929), are only a few movies in which he worked, in the 1920s."
"Boris Karloff along with Bela Lugosi and silent movie actor Lon Chaney, where the firsts actor to play evil roles in movie, undoubtedly his most memorable role is that of the monster in ""Frankenstein"" (1931), a masterpiece of horror movie that was directed by James Whale."
"In 1932 he starred his second horror movie ""Behind the Mask"" (1932), as Jim Henderson. That same year he obtained a role in ""Scarface"", with Paul Muni."
Blasphemy
"Blasphemy is a word that means ""speaking badly about a religion"", or ""insulting a god"". Some religions see blasphemy as a religious crime. Many countries witha state religion have laws that make blasphemy a crime. For example, blasphemy can be punished with the death penalty in Saudi Arabia or Pakistan. In other countries, the punishment for the crime is a fine, or imprisonment."
"Some countries do not have laws against blasphemy. For example, after the French Revolution, France made blasphemy legal to make sure people would have freedom of religion and the freedom of the press."
"The United States, Canada, and many European countries, have laws to protect people who speak badly about religion. Sometimes people do this in a satirical way, like with a movie that makes fun of a religion. In these countries, profanity is often protected by freedom of speech as well."
Brie
"Brie is a type of soft cheese with a yellowish interior and a white layer (the ""rind"") on the outside of the cheese. The rind is eaten as well as the inside of this cheese. Like other cheeses, Brie is a dairy product made from cows' milk. Brie cheese may be served with fruit as a dessert at the end of a meal, or with a relish."
"The cheese is sometimes served slightly melted or baked, in a round, lidded ceramic dish, and topped with nuts or fruit, or both."
How it is made.
"Brie is a French cheese, and protected by AOC (""Appellation d'origine contrôlée""). This means only this cheese from this region (near Paris) can properly call itself ""brie"". This is ignored by some countries outside Europe, but the system of AOC is used in the wine business, so many parts of the world do honour it, and have similar arrangements."
"The milk of soft cheeses (""à pate molle"" in French) is not heated during the production of the cheese. Talleyrand said about this kind of cheese that it was the ""king of cheeses"". He said that in the 19th century. This kind of cheese has been made for at least 1000 years."
"In Europe this cheese is usually not treated chemically, so it might change in consistency or color. It will go bad if it is not kept cool. If that means it is kept in a refrigerator, note that it should not be eaten that cold. It is best eaten when it is somewhat below normal room temperature. In most countries, brie-style cheeses are made with Pasteurized milk."
"Brie can be aged, that is, carefully treated for up to a year. Then it has a darker colour and a stronger taste. This is rarely seen outside of France."
Types of Brie.
The following kinds of Brie exist:
"Other French ""Bries"" are:"
Bries from outside France:
Brie de Meaux.
"Cheeses are made into round loaves, of about 36 cm in diameter. The cheeses then weight about 2.5 kilograms. It is best tasted from April to October, after a ripening period of 8 to 10 weeks. About 2% of the production occurs on farms."
Brie de Melun.
"The Brie de Melun is smaller than the Brie de Meaux, but more salt is added to it. The ripening period is 10 weeks. It is best consumed April to September, but it can be found March to November, in some locations. About 5% of production occurs on farms."
What Brie should look like.
"When people buy Brie, they should make sure that it has the following traits:"
Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord
"Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord (February 2, 1754 - May 17, 1838) was a French diplomat."
"He was a bishop and worked successfully for Louis XVI. He changed sides and served the French Revolution and Napoleon I. When Napoleon started losing his wars, Talleyrand changed sides again and served Louis XVIII. He represented France at the Congress of Vienna. He changed sides once more and served Louis Philippe I. Since the beginning of the 19th century he was known simply as ""Talleyrand"". He is widely seen as one of the most pragmatic and influential diplomats in European history. He was known to accept bribes from other European powers, especially while he served under Napoleon."
Pasteurization
Pasteurization (or pasteurisation) is a process of heat processing a liquid or a food to kill pathogenic bacteria to make the food safe to eat and to preserve longer. It involves heating the food to kill most harmful microorganisms. Producers pasteurize dairy and other foods to make them safe to eat. The process is named after Louis Pasteur. He was the first person to learn how to do it successfully. The first pasteurization was done by Louis Pasteur and Claude Bernard on 20 April 1862.
"Unlike sterilization, pasteurization is not intended to kill all microorganisms in the food. Instead, pasteurization gets a ""log reduction"" in the number of microorganisms. It brings their number down so they are unlikely to cause disease if the product is kept in the refrigerator and consumed before its sell-by date. Commercial sterilization of food is not common, because it tends to destroy the flavour of the food."
Carolina parakeet
The Carolina parakeet is an extinct species of parrot.
"It was the last parrot type to have lived before the European conquest in the eastern United States. It was found from the Ohio Valley to the Gulf of Mexico, and lived in old woods along rivers."
"The last wild Carolina parakeet was killed in Okeechobee County in Florida in 1904, and the last bird kept by people died at the Cincinnati Zoo in 1918. This was the male bird called ""Incas"", who died within a year of his mate ""Lady Jane"". It was not until 1939, however, that it was agreed that all the Carolina parakeets had died."
"At some date between 1937 and 1955, three parakeets looking like this sort of bird were seen and recorded on videotape in the Okefenokee Swamp of Georgia. However, the American Ornithologists Union thought that they had probably recorded escaped pets. Additional sightings were recorded in Okeechobee County in Florida until the end of the 1920s."
Reasons for extinction.
"The Carolina parakeet died out for a number of reasons. To make space for more farms, large areas of forest were cut down, taking away its living space. The colorful feathers (green body, yellow head, and red around the bill) were in demand as decorations in ladies' hats, and the birds were kept as pets. Even though the birds were bred easily in captivity, little was done to make sure enough birds were bred to avoid their dying out. Finally, they were killed in large numbers because farmers thought they were pests."
"Another reason that led to their extinction was that, unfortunately, they liked to return in large flocks to places where some of them had just been killed. This led to even more being shot by hunters as they gathered about the wounded and dead members of the flock."
Match Game
"Match Game was a game show that ran from 1962 to 1999. Hosted Premierie on 1973 Present CBS GSN &amp; More Premierie June 26 2016 on ABC During $100,000 Pyramid Match Game The Hollywood Squares (1983) Like The Price is Right in Wheel of Fortune October 31 1983 on 1962-2016 Present Finale Until of 1979 in 1980-1982 in 1990 Theme in 1960s-2010s Like Pyramid"
Contestant Competition.
"First the challenging contestant would pick a question, A or B. Host Gene Rayburn would read it to the contestant. Then the contestant and the six celebrities would write their answer to the question on a piece of paper. Then after the contestant and the celebrities got done with their answer, Gene would ask for the contestant's answer. They would tell it to him. Then he would ask the celebrities for their answers. If the contestant's and a celebrity's answer are the same the contestant would get a point, and a green triangle would light up."
"Then the defending contestant would take the remaining question. Then the process was the same as above, except red circles lit up."
Whoever had the most points at after two rounds of the above procedures would win $100 and go on to the Big Money Super Match.
Big Money Super Match.
Audience Match.
"Before the game show, the audience would be surveyed. Their top 3 answers to the question (e.g. Road ___) would be worth (3rd most popular) $100, (2nd most popular) $250, and (most popular) $500. The contestant would pick 3 celebrities to give them answers they thought would be under the $500 slot. Then the contestant would choose one of those answers or make up their own. The answers were revealed one at a time."
Head-to-Head Match.
"If the contestant won the Audience Match, they would get a chance to win 10 times that money. They had to match a celebrity's answer exactly to questions like ____ Bee. At first, the contestant chose the celebrity they wanted to play with. In 1978, the Star Wheel was introduced. The contestant spun a wheel to determine which celebrity they would be playing with. If the wheel stopped on a gold star section, the money the contestant would be playing for was doubled."
Other versions.
"The first ""Match Game"" had different rules from this one and was shown on the NBC network starting in 1962 and ending in 1969. Then, this ""Match Game"" was introduced on the CBS network in 1973. That version ended in 1979. In 1975, a syndicated version titled ""Match Game PM"" started. It had three rounds of gameplay, and two Audience Matches in the Big Money Super Match. It ended in 1981. A second syndicated version with the same gameplay as ""Match Game PM"" started in 1979, and ended in 1982. In 1983, it was combined with another game show, ""Hollywood Squares"", to form the ""Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour"", which was on television for one year. Six years later, in 1990, it was brought back for the ABC network with a new host, Ross Shafer. In this version, contestants played for cash. It also featured a new round called the ""Match Up"" round. It was played at the end of both rounds. To start, a contestant chose one of the celebrities. The contestant had 30 seconds (45 in the second round) to match the celebrity in Super Match-style questions. Each question had two choices. Matches were worth $50 in the first round and $100 in the second. This version ended in 1991, but in 1998 it returned with Michael Burger as host. It featured five celebrities instead of six. This version was not very famous, however, and ended in 1999."
Melanesia
Melanesia is a region of islands in Oceania.
"It stretches from the western side of the Eastern Pacific Ocean, to the Arafura Sea, northeast of Australia. Its name was invented in 1832 and means ""black islands""."
The following islands and groups of islands since the 19th century have been considered part of Melanesia:
Islands whose long-established inhabitants are of mixed ancestry and do not necessarily self-identify as Melanesian:
"Some of the islands to the west of New Guinea such as Halmahera, Alor, and Pantar can also be considered part of Melanesia, although people in this area do not make use of the term."
Diaphragm
The diaphragm is a muscle that is at the bottom of the ribcage of mammals.
Chromolithography and the poster.
"Chromolithography (color lithography) was invented by Engelmann &amp; Son, who were granted a patent in 1837. After that, it was a matter of time before it reached full commercial development."
"Because of its low production costs, over the 50 years after the American Civil War, millions of chromolithographs were printed and were sold for under $10. Louis Prang, a Bostonian, produced fine-art subjects, such as still lifes, landscapes, and classical subjects. Nevertheless, it was only after 1847 that the Jules Chéret posters showed their real potential."
Posters in the first half of the 20th century.
"Posters were used for war propaganda, to encourage young people to enlist in the army, and to sell government war bonds. From a strictly artistic view, the posters were unimaginative and far from the masterpieces of the late 19th century posters. The posters almost all came with a caption to bang the message home."
Gretchen Wilson
"Gretchen Wilson (born June 26, 1973) is a country music singer."
In 2004 she had her first number one album on Billboard's Hot Country Songs music chart. As late as 2013 she had a song on Billboard's Country Airplay music chart.

Prague
Prague (Praha in Czech) is the capital and the largest city of the Czech Republic. 1.4 million people live there.
"Prague has been known as one of the most beautiful European cities since the Middle Ages. It is often called the ""City of 100 Towers"", the ""Rooftop of Europe"" or the ""Heart of Europe."" Prague was a place where many merchants, artists and inventors met."
"Prague is full of historical monuments in all major artistic styles. The historic center of Prague is on both banks of the Vltava river. This historical center has six districts, which were once independent cities that joined together in the 18th century. These districts are Staré Město (Old Town), Pražský hrad (Prague castle), Josefov (Old Jewish Town), Nové Město (New Town), Malá Strana (Lesser Town), Hradčany (Prague Castle Quarter) and Vyšehrad. It was Prince Bořivoj who established Prague Castle. There are also lots of museums, galleries, theaters, concert halls, and other historic buildings."
History.
"The earliest inhabitants of the area lived in the valley of the Vltava river around 500 BC. Slavonic tribes came to Bohemia in about 500 AD. There is a legend about how the town of Prague started. Princess Libuše, the leader of a Slavonic tribe, chose a simple peasant Přemysl to be her husband. She told him to go and find a village on the banks of the Vltava and to start a town there. The town became Prague, ruled by the Přemyslid family.In the second half of the 9th century the castle’s original fortifications were built. During the reign of Wenceslas I (Václav in Czech) in the 10th century the church of St Vitus was built at Prague castle. Wenceslas was murdered by his brother when he was going to church. He was later made a saint. In the early 11th century the Přemyslid family got power in Moravia, too. Vratislav II was the first monarch to be called King of Bohemia."
"Another ruler, also called Wenceslas I, ruled as King of Bohemia from 1230. He encouraged the arts. Many Germans came to live in Prague. In 1257 King Otakar II founded the area of Prague called the Lesser Quarter for the Germans to live in. The last of the Přemyslid kings was King Wenceslas III. He was murdered in Moravia."
"During the Middle Ages Prague became very important as the capital of the Holy Roman Empire ruled by Charles IV (1316-1378) who was the most powerful ruler in Europe at the time. Charles made Prague a great city, building St Vitus Cathedral, a university, and a famous bridge called Charles Bridge which still exists."
"After Charles IV there were many arguments and fights in Prague. A priest called Jan Hus said that the Catholic Church had become too powerful. He was arrested and burned at the stake in 1415. A lot of people agreed with what Hus had been saying. These people were called Hussites. They threw a lot of important Catholic people out of the window (called ""defenestration""). A lot more fighting followed, and for many years Bohemia was ruled by kings who lived in other countries."
"From 1526 the Habsburg family ruled Bohemia. They were Catholics and ruled the Holy Roman Empire. In 1576 the Emperor Rudolph II moved the capital from Vienna to Prague. Prague became a rich town again, and people were free to worship as Catholics or Protestants. After Rudolph II there were a lot of religious fighting and more people were thrown out of windows. Eventually the fighting became part of the Thirty Years’ War. When Ferdinand II won the fighting a lot of Protestants left the country. New buildings in Prague were built in the Baroque style. The German language, not Czech, was spoken at court. Maria Theresa was the only queen to reign over Prague. One of her 16 children was Marie Antoinette who became queen of France. When her son Joseph II ruled, people stopped fighting about religion. The people were free to speak what they thought, and there was no more serfdom. Prague now had three parts: the Old Town, the Lesser Quarter and the New Town. Famous people such as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart visited the town often."
"In the 19th century industry came to Prague. Factories were built, a railway was built between Prague and Vienna. The Czech nationalist movement became very strong after 1848. They wanted to use their own language instead of German. The composers Smetana and Dvořák wrote music about their country, often using Czech folksongs. The National Theatre was opened in 1881."
"In June 1914 the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Habsburg throne, was murdered. This led to World War I. After the war an independent republic called Czechoslovakia was formed with Prague as its capital. Bohemia, Moravia and Slovakia were part of it. In 1938 Hitler invaded the country. It was liberated by Soviet troops in May 1945. However, the communists soon seized power and the country was ruled by communists who had to obey the Soviet Union. The prime minister Alexander Dubček gradually tried to make reforms. This period of time is called the ""Prague Spring"". In 1968 the Soviet Union sent tanks into Prague to Wenceslas Square to restore their power."
Democracy gradually came to Prague in 1989 when the Velvet Revolution happened. In 1993 the Czech Republic and Slovakia split into two countries. Today both these countries are part of the European Union.
Cultural sights.
"It is often reported as a number of deaths per 1000 individuals per year. For example, a mortality rate of 9 in a population of 1,000 would mean 9 deaths per year in that entire population."
Ricotta
"Ricotta is an Italian fresh whey cheese made from the whey of sheep's milk or cow's milk. Whey is a watery liquid that separates from curds when cheese is made. Ricotta is soft, grainy and white. It can be used in Italian desserts like cheesecake or cannoli or in dishes like lasagna. It contains protein and is a dairy product."
Whey
"Whey is a watery liquid that comes out of milk when it has been curdled and strained. It is also called milk plasma. It is a by-product of cheese making. ""Sweet whey"" is made during the making of rennet types of hard cheese like Cheddar or Swiss. ""Acid whey"" (also known as ""sour whey"") is made during the making of acid types of cheese such as cottage cheese. Whey also forms as a liquid on the top of yoghurt."
Uses.
"Whey can be used to make whey cheeses like ricotta. It can be added to processed foods like bread, pastry or crackers. It can also be used to feed animals."
Curd
"Curds are a dairy product made by ""curdling"" milk with rennet or yeast so that it separates, and taking away the liquid part (called whey). Milk that has been left to go sour will also naturally separate into curds and whey. Curds are used to make cheese. Curds and whey can be eaten together as a dish."
Pokhara
"Pokhara is the second largest city of Nepal. It is the main tourism centre of Nepal. It is 200 km away from the capital, Kathmandu."
&lt;br&gt;
Seal of Colorado
"The Seal of the State of Colorado is an adaptation of the ""Territorial Seal"" which was adopted by the ""First Territorial Assembly"" on November 6, 1861. The only changes made in the Territorial Seal design being the changing of the words, ""State of Colorado"" and the figures ""1876"" for the corresponding words on the territorial seal. The first ""General Assembly"" of the State of Colorado approved the adoption of the state seal on March 15, 1877. The ""Colorado Secretary of State"" alone is authorized to affix the Great Seal of Colorado to any document whatsoever."
Flag of Maine
"The Flag of the State of Maine has the state coat of arms on a blue field. In the center of the shield a moose rests under a tall pine tree. A farmer and seaman represent the normal reliance on agriculture and the sea by the state. The ""North Star"" represents the state motto: Dirigo (""I Lead"")."
Seal of Maine
"The Seal of the State of Maine was adopted in June 1820. There have been different kinds in the details of the seal, but the overall design and images remain true to the first. The center of the seal is a shield with a tranquil scene of a moose resting in a field bordered by water and woods, pine tree stand tall directly behind the moose. On either side of the shield, a farmer rests on his scythe, and a sailor leans on an anchor. Above the shield is the motto ""Dirigo"" (I lead), and a North Star. Below the shield is a banner that reads ""Maine"". The legislature of 1919 thought that the design of the seal should no longer vary, and the design is still used today."
Doctorate
"A doctorate is a degree earned by passing a doctoral dissertation. Usually, it refers to a Ph.D., but it can also be an Doctor of Medicine or an Juris Doctor. Colleges often give honorary doctorates to famous people who speak there."
Cluster (computing)
"In computing, a cluster is made of many individual computers that work together to solve a problem at hand. Clusters can have different forms: They can be whole computers working together, or only CPUs. These CPUs can communicate over a fast network, but they share the same hard disks, for example. Depending on the problem, solving it with a cluster of cheaper components can be less expensive that investing in better hardware that costs more."
Grid computing is different in that the individual computers work on separate tasks that are part of a large problem. They are usually more different from one another and geographically further apart than cluster computers are.
Cell biology.
"The cells of an animal or higher plant have two sets of chromosomes: they are diploid. When gametes (sex cells) are produced, they have only one set of chromosomes: they are haploid. They have undergone a process of cell division called meiosis. Two things happen during meiosis, each of which makes the offspring more variable. That means they are different from the parents and from each other."
Assortment.
"Assortment is when the double set of chromosomes becomes a single set in each gamete. Of each pair of chromosomes, ""which one goes into a single gamete is random"". Because the gene alleles on each chromosome are not always the same, this means that there is genetic variation between gametes. This process was Mendel's 'first law', the law of segregation."
Crossing over.
"Because crossing over occurs during meiosis, this increases the variety of the chromosomes. This makes recombination possible."
The consequence of assortment and crossing over makes it certain that no two offspring of the same mother and father are identical. Identical twins are the exception. They are identical genetically because they developed from the same fertilised egg.
Advantages and disadvantages.
"There are advantages and disadvantages of sexual reproduction, compared to asexual reproduction. The main issues are:"
Origin of sexual reproduction.
The origin of sexual reproduction is an advanced topic which cannot be dealt with here. A source which may help readers who are graduates in biological science may be helpful.
Leprosy
"Leprosy is a contagious disease. It has been known for a very long time. Today, it is mostly called Hansen's disease, named after the person who discovered the bacterium, Gerhard Armauer Hansen. It is caused by a bacterium, Mycobacterium leprae. A person with leprosy is called a leper."
"As of 2004, the estimated number of new infections was about 400,000."
"Getting the disease is hard, since it requires close contact with someone who has it, over a long period of time. In addition, about 95% of people seem to be naturally immune to it."
"Most cases of leprosy occur in India, and other developing countries. It has known to have been in the US before. There are practically no cases of leprosy in the developed world. This is because there are excellent drugs and people regularly take antibiotics which will kill the leprosy bacteria."
"In former times, leprosy was seen as a divine punishment for sins committed."
Symptoms.
"The symptoms of leprosy are irregular spots and patches on the skin. These are either lighter colored than the surrounding skin, or reddish in color. On those patches, hair will fall out, and they will feel numb to the patient. Nerves will form knots there."
"With the illness progressing the sense of touch will become less and less (until the patient feels completely numb). So called leptomes and ulcers will eat away the skin, the flesh and the organs on the patches."
"Usually people do not die of leprosy, but of secondary infections and diseases they get."
For many years there was a leprosy colony on the Hawaiian Island of Molokai called Kalaupapa. Tens of thousands of people from the United States that had the disease were sent there.
Dolley Madison
"Dolley Payne Todd Madison (May 20, 1768 – July 12, 1849) was the wife of US President James Madison. James Madison was president from 1809 to 1817 while Dolley Madison was the First Lady of the United States. She is best known for saving Washington's portrait when the British burned the White House in the War of 1814. Though she is also a famous entertainer, the first to serve ice cream in the White House."
"Dolley was born in New Garden. Now the place is known as Guilford County. It is in North Carolina. Some other account tells that she was born in a village named Payne’s Tavern. It is in Person County, North Carolina."
"Her father’s name was John Payne. As an unsuccessful farmer, he always faced shortage of money. Dolley’s mother was Mary Coles."
"Dolley spent her teenage years in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On January 7, 1790, she married John Todd, Jr. (1764-1793). Todd was a lawyer. They had two sons. Their names were John Payne (1792-1852) and William Temple (born and died in 1793). William died in a yellow fever epidemic. In the same year, her husband also died of the same yellow fever epidemic."
"Dolley Todd married James Madison on September 14, 1794. They had no children, but they raised Dolley's son from her first marriage, John Payne Todd. John Payne Todd was a notorious drunkard and gambler, which caused his mother many financial problems, especially after Madison died."
"In 1814, the British army had burnt the White House. Fleeing from her burning home, Dolley saved many records and papers. Legend states she also saved a painting of George Washington, though had to break it out of its frame."
"On the National First Lady Library she says, ""There is one secret, and that is the power we have in forming our own destinies."""
"The play has been made into movies on numerous occasions. One movie stars Mickey Rooney as the fairy Puck. Benjamin Britten wrote an opera based on the play, George Balanchine and Frederick Ashton have both made ballets about it, and Felix Mendelssohn wrote many pieces of music for the play which include an ""Overture"" and a ""Wedding March""."
Characters.

The Rustics:
Story.
"Egeus wants his daughter Hermia to marry Demetrius. Hermia does not want to marry him. She loves another man named Lysander. Hermia and Lysander decide to run away. Demetrius follows them. Helena, Hermia's best friend, is in love with Demetrius. She follows him. All four become lost in the woods near Athens."
"Meanwhile, Oberon and Titania are having an argument. Oberon decides to teach Titania a lesson. He puts a love potion into her eyes while she is asleep. This potion will make her fall in love with the first thing she sees when she wakes."
"Oberon finds Helena and Demetrius. He tells Puck to give Demetrius some of the love potion so that he will love Helena. Puck makes a mistake and puts the potion in Lysander's eyes. When Lysander wakes up, he loves Helena instead of his real sweetheart Hermia."
"The workmen, are practising a play in the woods for the upcoming marriage of Theseus and Hippolyta. Puck plays a trick on Nick Bottom by giving him donkey ears. The other actors run away, so Bottom goes to sleep. He is sleeping near Titania. She wakes up and falls in love with him."
"Oberon realises everything is all mixed up. He gives some of the love potion to Demetrius. Now Demetrius and Lysander both love Helena. Sad and confused, all the lovers fall asleep. At last, Puck rights all the wrongs. He makes Lysander love Hermia again, and makes Demetrius love Helena. Everyone is happy."
The workmen perform their play after the wedding of Theseus and Hippolyta. Oberon has stopped Titania being in love with Bottom. They are happy with each other again. The fairies use their magic to bless all the lovers.
Vodka
"Vodka is a Russian alcoholic drink that is usually about 40% alcohol. It is clear (but can be flavoured), though it is sometimes mixed with other liquids before people drink it. It was first popular in the Slavic countries of Eastern Europe and former republics of the Soviet Union."
Things that are made into vodka.
Vodka can be made from different things:
The process to make vodka is:
"Unlike cognac or whisky, vodka is not usually matured in barrels, but bottled immediately. Some Scandinavian vodkas called ""akvavit"" (Latin ""aqua vitae"", ""water of life"") are matured in oak barrels before they are bottled. When the vodka is bottled, it is ready for drinking."
History.
"Most people think the name ""vodka"" comes from the Slavic word for water in its diminutive form, ""little water"". The earliest mention of Vodka in Poland is in 1405. The Russians are known to have first used the word in June 8, 1751. It is not known if it was the Russians or the Poles who made the first drinks that could be classified as vodka, as sources provide various views on this topic (though it's important to remember that the first mention of the word ""vodka"" in Cyrillic refers to a medicinal drink bought by the merchants of Kievan Rus from Poland). It is also worth noting that vodka was first used as medicine. When it became a popular drink, it was first known in Polish as ""gorzałka"" - from the Old Polish word ""gorzeć"", meaning burn. At first, gorzałka was a people's drink, but in the Slavic countries it soon became common among the nobility as well. it is worth noting that the common Ukrainian word for vodka is ""horilka"" which bears an extremely close resemblance to the Polish gorzalka. Both words roots have the same meaning (""hority"" - to burn; ""gorzeć"", also to burn)"
Different kinds of vodka.
"There are two basic kinds of Vodka: clear vodka and flavored vodka. Some types of vodka have plants or herbs added to the unflavored vodka to make it taste better. Contrary to popular belief, flavoured vodka is not new - it has been a part of Polish drinking tradition for centuries. It is only relatively recently in history that clear and flavoured vodkas have found their way to Western countries such as the UK or US."
How vodka is consumed.
"Vodka is either drunk pure, or cocktails are made with it. The simplest form of cocktail is to mix it with orange or lemon juice. Usually, vodka is drunk during a longer meal. Usually salty or sour things (not sweets) are served. In Poland and Russia (as well as some of their neighbours, such as Ukraine or Lithuania), vodka is drunk from glasses that can hold about 100 grams (0,1 litres) of vodka. The glass is usually emptied in one draught, while holding the breath. Directly afterwards something small is eaten. In most Eastern European countries it is consumed with pickled cucumbers. Before drinking, a toast is given."
Cultural.
"Vodka is a key element of Slavic tradition in some countries of Eastern Europe (especially Poland, Belarus, Ukraine and Russia). It has also spread to become a part of national culture in Baltic countries like Lithuania and Nordic countries like Sweden. It's traditional in Russia and other Slavic countries (as well as some Roma communities in Eastern Europe) to put a glass of vodka with a slice of bread (usually black bread) on top on graves or near photos of the deceased in their memory. This is similar to what people in Western countries do with flowers."
Sexual reproduction
Sexual reproduction is how most animals and plants reproduce. Some protists and fungi also reproduce this way. Organisms that reproduce sexually have two different sexes: male and female.
"In sexual reproduction, offspring are produced when sperms fertilise eggs from the female. Various steps are involved in this process."
"That was the Ford Mustang in 2015 but in 2016, Shelby decided to boost the 6th generation Mustang by creating the all new Shelby GT350R which had a 5.2 litre V8 with 526hp at 7500RPM. This was a great increase in performance since the 2015 Mustang. It also included many carbon fibre pieces that were put into the car to reduce its weight. The stock rims in fact were the first ever carbon fibre rims created by NASA, a space station in the USA. The GT350R also had a mounted carbon fibre spoiler and quad exhaust pipes. The same Mustang will be sold in America until 2018, where Ford is rumoured to give us a brand new facelifted Mustang..."
"Beginning with the 2021 model year, Ford also uses the Mustang name on a new, large electric crossover model called the Mach-E."
"The 2021 Mustang Mach-E is Ford's first all-electric crossover, and it was designed and named after the company's iconic pony car. The Mach-E also pays homage to the ""Mach 1"" moniker that has been used on high-performance Mustangs of old. Ford said it went with the name because it needed the electrified crossover to be as desirable as a Tesla to usher in its new era of electric vehicles. It's expected to provide 300 miles of driving range when paired with the extended-range battery and rear-wheel drive."
Red Hat Linux
"Red Hat Linux is a discontinued Linux operating system, replaced by RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)."
"Red Hat made it public in the past and it was used by many Linux users. The last publicly released version was Red Hat Linux 9 in April, 2003. Red Hat then decided to discontinue a future release of Red Hat Linux and started the paid ""Red Hat Enterprise Linux"" instead. There are some redistributions of RHEL, though such as CentOS which are free and come without Red Hat's branding, logos etc. due to trademark restrictions."
Red Hat Linux 7.3 version is still widely used around the world for servers and workstations.
"Around 2005, The Red Hat company released their system as Fedora Core, intended to be a test platform for new technologies. It is now called just 'Fedora' and its present release acts as a base for the next release of RHEL."
Sacavém
"Sacavém is a city in Portugal, near the capital Lisbon. There is about eighteen hundred people living there. Sacavém is on the border of the River Tagus. It confines with the parishes of ""Bobadela"", ""Camarate"", ""Moscavide"", ""Portela"", ""Prior Velho"" and ""Unhos""."
Sacavém is very well known for its ceramics.
Shooter
A shooter is a kind of video game. The aim of the game is to beat enemies by shooting (or otherwise killing) them. The enemies shoot back.
"Many of the oldest computer games were shooters; the first video game ever made was a shooter called ""Computer Space"". And one of the first games that many people played was a shooter called ""Space Invaders""."
"There are lots of different kinds of shooter. Now many people like first-person shooters. But there are other kinds too. In Japan many people play shooters where the enemies fire lots of bullets. The bullets make beautiful patterns on the screen. This kind of shooter is called a ""barrage shooter, bullet hell game"" or a ""curtain fire shooter"". It is also called by the Japanese name, ""danmaku"". One of these games is Touhou. Another that combines bullet hell elements with an RPG is Undertale."
Sushi
is a traditional food that is from Japan.
"The word ""Sushi"" comes from the Japanese word meaning vinegar, and "", meaning rice."
"Sushi is made with specially prepared rice, called . The rice is mixed with vinegar, salt, and sugar. Sushi is known for having raw or cooked seafood in it, but it sometimes has non-fish foods such as vegetables. Some sushi is wrapped in a sheet of seaweed called ."
"Sushi is traditionally eaten by hand, but it is not wrong to eat it using chopsticks. Gari (Japanese pickled ginger slices) must be eaten with chopsticks."
"There are many different kinds of sushi. The most common sushi in Japan is : fish meat that is placed on top of a small portion of ""sumeshi"". Sometimes you may find other ingredients on top of the ""sumeshi"", such as roe (fish eggs), and sea urchin meat, instead of fish. Another type of sushi, , consists of ""sumeshi"" rolled around fish and/or vegetables. In the US, ""makizushi"" is more popular than ""nigirizushi"". Another type is known as or a hand roll. This kind of sushi comes in a cone-shape, created by the ""nori"" wrapped around the ingredients inside. They are usually filled with a mixture of ""sumeshi"", fish, and vegetables."
"Sushi is eaten with your bare hands or chopsticks. Soy sauce and wasabi are commonly eaten with sushi. ""Gari"" (sweet, pickled ginger) can often be found alongside a plate of sushi and also a little bit of wasabi, used as a palate cleanser."
"In Japan, sushi is sometimes sold in ""conveyor-belt shops"" called ""kaiten zushi"" (回転寿司), where plates of sushi are put on a moving belt that passes by the customers. People freely take the sushi they want as it passes. The color of the plate shows the price of the sushi. This way of serving sushi is becoming more popular in other countries as well."
History.
"Sushi began when rice farming came to Japan over 2,000 years ago. The original type of sushi was developed in the Nara Prefecture as a way of preserving fish in fermented rice. During the Muromachi period, people would eat the rice ""and"" the fish. During the Edo period, vinegar, not fermented rice, was used. In more recent times, it has become a fast food associated with Japanese culture."
"The origin of sushi goes back to Southeast Asia around the 4th century B.C.. At that time, it was called ""narezushi"". The fish was originally eaten alone, without rice. Later on, a style of namaranarezushi reached Japan. Namaranerezushi combined the fish with rice."
What is called sushi in modern times was created by Hanaya Yohei (1799–1858) at the End of the Edo period. Sushi invented by Hanaya was an early form of fast food that was not fermented. It was prepared quickly. It could be eaten with one's hands. This fish was originally known as Edomae zushi because it used freshly caught fish in Edo-Bay or Tokyo Bay. The fish used in modern sushi no longer usually comes from Tokyo Bay.
"By the early 1900s, sushi was being served in the United States, after many Japanese people had immigrated there. The first United States sushi shop opened up in 1906 in Little Tokyo in Los Angeles."
The Who were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990.
Led Zeppelin
"Led Zeppelin was an English rock band. The group was started in 1968 and broke up in 1980. The members were Robert Plant (vocals), Jimmy Page (lead guitar), John Paul Jones (bass), and John Bonham (drums). Led Zeppelin ended in 1980 after the accidental death of John Bonham. After Bonham's death, the band believed that nobody could take his place and decided not to continue. The band played together again in a tribute concert in London on 10 December 2007 with Jason Bonham, John's son, playing the drums. The band is one of the most influential rock bands of all time and one of the most successful music artists in history, selling 300 million albums around the world."
USB flash drive
"A USB flash drive (USB stands for ""Universal Serial Bus"") is a popular way to store digital information. Flash drives are an easy way to share data (information). A USB flash drive can be attached to a USB port, and provides a certain amount of storage space, which can be used to store data. USB flash drives are used with devices found in homes, workplaces and schools. Below are some examples of these devices:"
"They are called ""flash drive"" because they use flash memory to store files. Flash memory is a type of computer chip. The first flash drives had 8 megabytes of storage. Each year, larger flash drives will become available. In April 2012, 256 gigabyte flash drives were introduced to the market."
"Other common names for a flash drive include jumpdrive, pendrive, thumbdrive or simply USB."
"USB flash drives have some advantages over other portable storage devices. They are physically much smaller and more rugged than floppy disks. They can read data faster, and store more data than floppy disks. Floppy disks have become obsolete when the price of USBs has become cheaper."
Uses.
"Flash drives are used to store any type of data file, or to move data from one computer to another. USB flash drives have a lot of storage space. It is often easier to use a flash drive than to carry many CD-ROMs. Some computer programs can be run from a USB flash drive. These special versions of programs are called ""portable"" versions."
"Computer administrators, or people who manage the computer systems, sometimes use flash drives. Sometimes flash drives are also used to run a computer virus scanner. They are often used to repair a computer system that was damaged or faulty."
Police in the cyber division can use flash drives to take evidence.
Booting operating systems.
Most computers today can boot from a USB drive. Special operating systems can run from a bootable flash drive. They are called Live USB versions.
Audio players.
Many companies make small digital audio players (usually called an mp3 player). These are actually flash drives that can make sound. Examples include the Creative MuVo and the iPod shuffle. Some of these players are real USB flash drives as well as music players; others just play music.
Many of the smallest players are powered by a permanently fitted rechargeable battery. The battery power can be charged from the USB port.
Music storage and marketing.
Digital audio files can be moved from one computer to another. The files can be played on a software media player. Many home and car music systems have a USB port. A USB flash drive can be connected to play music files.
"Music artists have sold or given away USB flash drives. The first time this happened was in 2004—the German band WIZO released the ""Stick EP"", only as a USB drive. It contained five high quality MP3s; it also included a video, pictures, lyrics, and guitar tablature."
"Since then, artists including Kanye West, Nine Inch Nails and Ayumi Hamasaki have released music and promotional material on USB flash drives."
In arcades.
"In the arcade game ""In the Groove"" and ""In The Groove 2"", flash drives are used to transfer high scores, screenshots, dance edits, and combos throughout sessions. In later versions, players can also store custom songs and play them on any machine on which this feature is enabled. While use of flash drives is common, the drive must be Linux compatible, causing problems for some players."
"In the arcade games ""Pump it Up NX2"" and ""Pump it Up NX Absolute"", a specially produced flash drive is used as a ""save file"" for unlocked songs, as well as progressing in the WorldMax and Brain Shower sections of the game."
"In the arcade game ""Dance Dance Revolution X"", a special USB flash drive was made by Konami, letting players link the Sony PlayStation 2 version."
Brand and product promotion.
"Flash drives are very cheap to produce. So, they are sometimes used to promote a product. At most technical trade fairs, many exhibitors will promote their products by giving away free drives."
"In other situations, they may be sold at less than wholesale price, or included as a bonus with another product."
"Usually, such drives will be stamped with a company's logo, as a form of advertising ."
"The drive may be blank drive, or already have documents or software loaded on to it. These are called preloaded drives."
Piano Duos.
"Some works are written for two people to play together using two pianos. These are usually called piano duos. Examples include Mozart’s Sonata in D major K448. The Sonata op 34 by Johannes Brahms started as a string quintet but he changed it to a piano concerto, then a piano duo, and eventually a piano quintet. The Suite op 17 by Rachmaninoff is another. Most piano duos are very hard to play and need very good pianists. Piano concertos can be played on two pianos, with one player playing the solo part and the other playing the orchestra’s music."
Piano Six Hands.
"There is also a small repertoire of pieces for three people to play at one piano. This is called Piano six hands. These pieces are often fun pieces which are not too hard to play, although there are examples of serious pieces. The three people need to be good friends, because it is a bit of a squash. The player at the bottom ought to do the pedalling but it may be easier for the middle player to do it."
Piano six hands
"Music described as piano six hands is for three pianists at one piano, as distinct from piano duet which is music for two pianists at one piano, and from piano trio which is music for piano, violin and cello. Not much music has been written for this combination, although there are several arrangements of music originally written for other forces."
Examples.
"Compositions include 5 pieces by Percy Grainger, Sergei Rachmaninoff's Romance and Valse, Alfred Schnittke's Hommage, Carl Czerny's op.17 and 741, Jean Cras's ""Âmes d’enfants"", Paul Robinson (composer)'s ""Pensees"" and ""Monmartre"", various pieces by German composer Armin Fuchs, Bulgarian composer Tomislav Baynov's ""Metrorhythmia 1"", John Pitts's ""Are You Going?"", Greek composer Dionysis Boukouvalas's ""Fantasy on a theme by Steve Reich"", Canadian composer Paul Frehner's ""Slowdown"" and Italian composer Fabio Mengozzi's ""Promenade""."
Pedal
"A pedal is something that is made to work by someone's foot. The word ""pedal"" comes from the Latin word for ""foot"". Many things can be made to work by pedals. These include:"
Rice wine
"Rice wine is a word some people use to talk about alcoholic drinks. However, it is not a true wine, despite the name. True wine is made by fermenting grapes, and perhaps other fruit. In rice wine, the starch in the rice is first changed into sugar. This sugar is then fermented. This process is more like the fermentation as it is done in beer."
"The ""rice wines"" made in this manner have more alcohol in them than normal wines (18–25% alcohol compared to 10–14% for normal wines). Beers on the other hand usually have 4–8% alcohol in them."
"Many people use the term ""rice wine"" to refer to sake (which is just one variant of many different kinds of rice wines)."
Alcopop
"Alcopops are alcoholic drinks. They are also known as Ready-to-drink (RTD), Flavored Alcoholic Beverage (FAB) or Flavored Malt Beverage (FMB). They are usually available in bottles or cans. They contain about the same amount of alcohol as a beer. Usually, they are very sweet, so that the alcohol can not be tasted."
"There are two different kinds of this drinks. In Europe, they are usually spirits mixed with lemonade, like vodka with lemon juice (and a lot of sugar, so the alcohol cannot be tasted), or rum with fruit juice (also very sweet). In the US, they tend to be beers, which taste very sweet."
"Because they are very sweet, alcopops tend to be more popular among young people. Since the fact that they contain alcohol is usually not obvious from the taste, these drinks are considered to be dangerous for young people by many countries. These have either raised the taxes on the drinks, or they have outlawed the sale of these drinks to people under a certain age (usually 18, sometimes 21 years)."
Pedal (music)
"Pedals on musical instruments are used to control parts of the instrument, or provide extra notes."
There are several musical instruments which have pedals for various reasons.
Piano.
"The piano has at least two pedals; large concert grand pianos always have three. The pedal on the right (operated by the player's right foot) sustains the sound of the notes for as long as the pedal is depressed. It does this by lifting the dampers from the strings. Some of the other strings even start to vibrate as well (""in sympathy"")."
"The pedal on the left makes the sound quieter. It is called the ""una corda"" pedal (Italian for ""one string""). This is because, in the early days of the piano, the una corda pedal made all the hammers move over so that a hammer would only hit one string for each note instead of three (most notes on a piano each have three strings to make a bigger sound). On modern pianos the hammers actually hit two strings instead of just one. They also tend to hit the string at a point where the hammer is softer, away from the grooves which get worn in the hammerhead. On an upright piano the una corda pedal moves the hammers closer to the strings so that they do not hit them so hard."
"On pianos which have a middle pedal (called a sostenuto pedal) any note or chord which the player is holding down when the pedal is pressed will be sustained, but any more notes he plays afterwards will not be affected."
Organ.
On pipe organs there is a pedalboard with pedals which play notes in the same way that the fingers are playing notes. An organ pedalboard usually has two and a half octaves of notes. These are low notes written in the bass clef. An organist has to learn to play with the feet at the same time as with the hands. He uses the toes or the heels of his shoes. It is even possible to play four notes at once (four part chords) but this is very difficult and usually found in some modern French music.

Gustave Courbet
Jean Désiré Gustave Courbet (10 June 1819 – 31 December 1877) was a French painter. He was the leader of the Realist movement in 19th-century French painting. Courbet was prepared to try out new ideas and ways of painting. His paintings made social comment on the world around him.
"Courbet's paintings were an inspiration to many other painters, particularly the French Impressionists and Post-Impressionists. Edouard Manet, Edgar Degas, Vincent van Gogh and Henri Toulouse-Lautrec were all inspired by Gustave Courbet's paintings of people. His landscape paintings were an inspiration to Claude Monet, Seurat, Cezanne and many other painters."
Early life.
"Courbet was born in 1819, and was the son of Régis and Sylvie Oudot Courbet in Ornans, Doubs. Courbet's sisters, Zoé, Zélie and Juliette, were his first models for drawing and painting."
"When Courbet was twenty he went to Paris in 1839, and worked at the studio of two other painters, Steuben and Hesse. He was not happy there, and wanted to work on his own. He studied the works of many great masters, including Goya, Velazquez and Titian. He painted several self-portraits at this time. He often returned home to Ornans to hunt, fish and find inspiration in the countryside and country life."
"In 1846–1847 Coubet travelled to the Netherlands and Belgium where he studied the paintings of Rembrandt, Franz Hals and Jan Steen who all painted in the 1600s. The paintings by these artists often showed realistic scenes and portraits of everyday life. They showed ordinary people at the table together, dancing, writing, cooking, working at trades and in businesses and in the fields. There were many pictures of soldiers. Courbet decided that he wanted to paint scenes of ordinary life the way that these artists did. He did not want to paint scenes from literature, history or mythology like most other artists in France at that time.83"
Success.
"Courbet painted a large picture of everday-life at Ornans. The painting, called ""After Dinner at Ornans"", shows four men who have just finished a meal at a little table, which is perhaps in an inn. One man is playing his violin, one man is lighting his pipe. Courbet sits listening, with his head leaning on his hand. A large dog is curled under a chair. Courbet showed the painting at the Salon Exhibition in Paris. It was a great success. It won a Gold Medal and was bought by the French Government.32 Because of the gold medal, Courbet could hang his pictures at the Salon Exhibitions without having them checked by a jury first. This rule was changed in 1857.55 Courbet's work, and the work of Honoré Daumier and Jean-François Millet, became known as ""Realism"". Like the Dutch painters he admired, Courbet often painted in broad, rough brush strokes. He often used dark earthy colours, particularly brown, in his paintings."
"""Stone Breakers""."
"In 1849 Courbet saw two people working by the roadside, using small hammers to break large rocks into gravel. One was an old man and the other was a young boy. Courbet painted a picture of this scene. He explained it to a friend ""It is not often that one meets with so complete an expression of poverty and so, right then and there I got the idea for a painting. I told them to come to my studio the next morning."""
The picture soon became one of the most famous scenes of the life of poor people that has ever been painted. It was destroyed during World War II in Dresden.31
"""A Burial at Ornans""."
"Courbet's other important painting that was shown at the Salon of 1850 was a scene of life at his village. Beginning in 1849, he painted the funeral of his great-uncle who had died the previous year. Courbet got all the village people who had been at the funeral to come to his studio and pose for him, one by one, until the painting was complete. The painting was very large, 10 by 22 feet (3.1 by 6.6 meters). The famous artist Jacques Louis David had once painted a very large picture in the same way. David's picture was of the ""Coronation of Napoleon"" and showed all the people who were present."
"Some people praised ""The Funeral at Ornans"" but other people were very angry about it. They thought that it was wrong to show the burial of an ordinary man in a huge painting, as if he was as important as an emperor. They thought that it was wrong to show the poor people of a village, with their old clothes and dirty boots, as if they were all as important as lords and ladies.4 Some of the critics said that Courbet was deliberately trying to paint ugliness. Many people came to see the picture and liked the new Realist way of painting. Courbet said: ""The Burial at Ornans was ... the burial of Romanticism."""
"Courbet became a celebrity. (He became famous and written about in the newspapers- like a film star.) People said he was a genius, a ""terrible socialist"", and a ""savage"".8"
Courbet wrote to a friend in 1850:
"During the 1850s Courbet painted many other pictures using common folk and friends as his subjects, such as ""Village Damsels"" (1852), the ""Wrestlers"" (1853), ""Bathers"" (1853), ""The Sleeping Spinner"" (1853), and ""The Wheat Sifters"" (1854)."
"""The Artist's Studio""."
"Courbet then painted another huge picture. This painting is called ""The Artist's Studio"" and is about seven years in his life as a painter. He shows himself at the centre of the picture, working on a large landscape painting. Behind him is an artists' model, who is naked. All around Courbet are his friends and people from his village. His mother stands to one side of the picture. Another woman is sitting on the floor feeding her baby. A little boy watches the artist, while a white cat plays on the floor."
"In 1855 Coubet took this picture, with ""Burial at Ornan"" and twelve other paintings to be shown in a big international exhibition in Paris called ""Exposition Universelle"". The two biggest paintings and another one were sent away because there was not enough room. Courbet was angry. He had his own building put up, and showed forty of his paintings.52 Many other artists praised Courbet, but some people laughed at him, and the public did not buy very many of his pictures.84 Because of what he had done, younger artists heard about him and admired him. These included James McNeill Whistler in the United States as well as Édouard Manet in France."
Later life.
In 1857 Courbet showed six pictures in the Salon exhibition. One was a hunting scene and one was a picture of two prostitutes lying under a tree on the banks of the River Seine in Paris. Many people came to the exhibition. The hunting scenes were very popular for decorating the halls and dining rooms of large houses.52
"For the rest of his life, Courbet painted erotic pictures like the picture of the prostitutes, and also many more hunting scenes. His last erotic painting was called ""The Origin of the World"" and was a close-up painting of female genitals. This painting was not shown in a public exhibition until 1988. He also painted many landscapes, which he began by doing outdoor sketches, then made into large paintings in his studio. By the 1870s Courbet was thought of as one of the leading artists in France. The emperor offered to make Courbet a member of the Légion d'honneur which was the highest honour in France, but Courbet refused to accept it. He believed that he belonged to the poor and ordinary people, not to the high and mighty."
"At this time, there were many political problems in France. Courbet became involved in the political problems. In 1871, he was blamed because a public monument called the Vendôme Column had been demolished. He was put in prison for six months. In 1873, the new government expected him to pay to have the monument restored and put back. He did not have enough money so left France to live in Switzerland. The government decided to make terms so that Courbet could pay for the column in yearly payments of 10,000 francs for 33 years. Courbet died at La Tour-de-Peilz, Switzerland, on 31 December 1877, one day before the first payment was due. He was 58 and died of liver disease, made worse by heavy drinking."

"Certain IP addresses can be assigned freely on the local area network. Since they are not unique, they are not routed on the internet. The addresses which can be freely assigned are called private IP addresses, and the ones which are unique are called public. To be routed, a private address needs to be translated into a public one. This process of translating between private and public addresses is called network address translation, or NAT. Routers and firewalls often also perform this task."
Reaching one or more devices.
There are three different types of addresses:
Obtaining a new IP address.
"There are different ways of getting a new IP address. One of them is called Bootstrap Protocol (usually shortened to BOOTP). The device that needs a new address, does not know what network it is in, so it uses an IP address of all zeroes (0.0.0.0) which it sends as a broadcast to the current network, on a special port. In addition, it sends the MAC address of the network card, plus a 4 byte random number. The BOOTP server will send a reply, also as broadcast, addressed to a different port. The reply will contain the mac address of the client, the random number, and the IP address of the client. When the client receives the data, it will set the address specified. If the BOOTP server is configured that way, it will also send the IP address and hostname of the BOOTP Server, the name and path to a file which should be loaded to boot the client (using TFTP) or the name of a directory, which the client should mount using NFS."
"DHCP extends BOOTP, and allows to send more information, such as the address of a time server, or information which is useful for routing."
"IP addresses obtained automatically can be dynamic or static. Static addressing means the same machine will always get the same IP address. With dynamic addresses, a device will get the next address which is not used. Dynamic addresses which are used need to be reviewed from time to time. If they are not renewed, they can be used for other devices."
IP Version 4.
"With IPv4, each address consists of four 8-digit binary numbers, called octets. An IPv4 address is 32 bits in total. The biggest number one can make with 8 regular digits is 99,999,999, but the biggest number one can make with 8 binary digits is 255 (11111111 in binary), so each octet can be any number from 0 to 255."
An IPv4 address could look something like this:
Each octet is converted to its decimal form and separated by a period.
"There are also special meanings associated with two different ending numbers. In general, a last number of 0 stands for the network (called ""base address""), and a last number of 255 stands for all hosts on that network (called ""broadcast address""). Computers that are on the same local network share 3 of the 4 numbers. A computer can be on more than one network. It can also have several names."
Public/Private addresses.
"The problem with IPv4 is that it only allows for 4.3 billion addresses, and we've almost used them all. To delay this, Network Address Translation (NAT) was created. Network Address Translation has a network share one ""public"" IP address and give every computer on the network a ""private"" IP address. Everyone living in the same house uses the same address, but mail can be meant for multiple different people living in the house."
Special IP addresses.
"There are some IP addresses that are reserved for special purposes. For example, the address ""127.0.0.1"" is called the Loopback Address and will ""loop back"" any packets sent to this address back to the computer that sent them, like sending mail to yourself. Although this may not seem useful, it is used to test servers."
Network.
It identifies the class of a network.
Host Part.
It identifies the host on a network.
Static IP Address.
It is a permanent internet address. It has to be configured manually. It is used in smaller networks. All servers use static IP addresses. It is a simple way for communication.
Dynamic IP Address.
It is a temporary internet address. It is assigned by a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server from a specific range of IP address.
IPv4 subnetting.
"To make a network work faster, it is split up into subnets. To do this, an IP address contains a ""network"" ID, ""subnet"" ID, and a ""host"" ID. A special binary number called a Subnet Mask is used to determine the size of the network, subnet, and host IDs."
"The original IPv4 only supported 254 networks, so in 1981 the Internet addressing specification was changed to a classful network architecture. Classful network design allowed for a larger number of individual networks. The first three bits of an IP address determined its ""class"". Three classes (""A"", ""B"", and ""C"") were defined for normal computer communication (Unicast). The size of the network ID was based on the class of the IP address. Each class used more octets for the network ID, making the host ID smaller and reducing the number of possible hosts."
"Classful networks have been replaced by Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) since 1993. CIDR also provides a network address and host address. CIDR does not have classes, which means network and host address sizes don't have to be in octets."
"An IPv4 Address in CIDR notation looks like192.168.0.14/24The slash and number represent the amount of bits that the network id uses, in this case 24 or 3 octets."
IP Version 6.
"Because IPv4 is only 32 bits, the number of available addresses will run out. To prevent this, an organization called the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) created IP Version 6 (IPv6), which will eventually finish replacing IPv4."
"IP Version 6 uses 8 octets each 16 bits = 128 bits in total. Octets in IPv6 are written in hexadecimal, and separated by colons (:). An IPv6 address might look like this:"
"Historically, heavy foods were eaten because most work was manual. Before the industrial revolution, men and women doing hard work needed more calories per day than they need today. At any rate this applies to countries which are highly mechanized. Porridge is a good example of the heavy calorie-laden food which has gradually gone out of favor."
Fresnel lens
"A Fresnel lens is an optical lens, which was originally developed for Lighthouses. It is named after its inventor, French physicist Augustin-Jean Fresnel. The name is pronounced /freɪˈnɛl/ (fray-NELL), the 's' is silent. Before Fresnel, Buffon and Condorcet proposed a similar design, as a way to make large burning lenses."
"The design allows the construction of lenses of large aperture and short focal length without the weight and volume of material that would be required in conventional lens design. Compared to earlier lenses, the Fresnel lens is much thinner. More light can pass through. Lighthouses that use these kind of lenses can be seen from farther away."
Giacomo Meyerbeer
"Giacomo Meyerbeer (born near Berlin, 5 September 1791; died Paris, 2 May 1864) was a famous German-born opera composer. He was the most important composer of French Grand opera during the 1830s and 1840s. Although he was tremendously popular in his day, his music is not often played now."
Life.
Early years.
"Meyerbeer was born into a rich Jewish family in Tasdorf (now a part of Rüdersdorf), near Berlin. His father owned large sugar refineries in Berlin and in Italy. His mother also came from a rich family. Her father had been important in Germany’s struggle to be free of the French in 1812 when Napoleon was trying to conquer much of Europe. Giacomo’s mother did a lot of good work trying to help people who were wounded during the Napoleonic wars."
"Many famous people came to the house where Giacomo’s family lived. Some of the visitors were from the royal Prussian court, including the future King Friedrich Wilhelm IV. The naturalist and explorer Alexander von Humboldt also visited them quite often."
"The first piano teacher the boy had was Franz Lauska, who also taught the royal princes. He also had lessons in composition. Meyerbeer first played in public in 1801 playing Mozart's Piano Concerto in D Minor in Berlin. He wrote his first opera in 1810. In the same year he went to Darmstadt to study with the well-known music theorist Abbé Vogler. There he met the young Carl Maria von Weber who was also a pupil of Vogler. He left Vogler in 1811 and tried to get some work in Munich. In 1813 he found he had been offered a job as court composer to the Grand Duke of Hessen. Vogler had probably recommended him for the job. At this time Meyerbeer was better known as a pianist than as a composer. He travelled to London to hear an important pianist based there, namely J.B.Cramer. There he met other famous pianists such as Kalkbrenner and Ferdinand Ries."
Italy.
"In 1816 Meyerbeer went to Italy. He wanted to learn about Italian opera and collect Italian folksongs. While he intended at first to stay only three months, he stayed most of the next nine years. He made some trips back to Germany and Austria during this time. He composed several operas which became very popular. People started to compare him with the famous Rossini. However, in Germany people were not interested in his music. He took his opera ""Il crociato in Egitto"" to London and then to Paris, where it was a success. The opera is remembered now for being the last opera ever to have a part for a castrato singer."
"He was becoming well-known now. Spontini asked him to compose an opera for Berlin. He became friends, in Paris, with the librettist Eugène Scribe who had a lot of influence in the French theatre."
The Grand Operas.
"From 1825 onwards Meyerbeer spent his life travelling about Europe. He was often in Paris and in Berlin, but did not live in either of these places. He stayed in hotels or private houses wherever he went. One reason why he travelled was because of his health. His wife also had bad health, so they often went to spa towns to try to get better. He also travelled about to watch productions of his operas, and to hear young singers."
"When Carl Maria von Weber died, he left an opera, ""Die drei Pintos"", unfinished. It was sent to Meyerbeer in the hope that he would finish it, but he did not seem interested. In the end Mahler finished it many years later."
"Meyerbeer made changes to ""Il crociato in Egitto"" and turned it into a grand opera for the Opéra in Paris. He changed it from an Italian to a French opera, composing extra dance music and a new overture. He was determined to be famous in Paris."
"In 1826 he married his cousin. They had two children, but they both died when they were very small."
"In 1828 Daniel Auber, a famous French composer of the time, had composed a very popular opera called ""La muette de Portici"". It was the first French grand opera. Meyerbeer realized he could not become really popular by turning his Italian operas into French grand opera, so he took his comic opera ""Robert le Diable"" and changed it into a grand opera. Audiences loved it. Within three years it had been performed in 77 theatres in 10 different countries. Many composers made their own arrangements of some of the tunes from the opera. He was given many honours: the Chevalier of the Legion d’honneur, the title of Prussian Hof Kapellmeister (Director of Music at the Royal Court), and was made a member of the Prussian Academy of Arts and a member of the French Institute."
"Meyerbeer realized that anything else he wrote would have to be really good. In 1836 he produced another opera ""Les Huguenots"". This too was extremely popular."
"In 1842 he went to Boulogne to improve his health. There he met Wagner who asked him for financial help to stage his operas ""Rienzi"" and ""The Flying Dutchman"". Meyerbeer lent him money, but stopped giving him money when he heard that Wagner was secretly criticizing him."
Berlin years.
"When Spontini died Meyerbeer was made Generalmusikdirektor in Berlin. His opera ""Les Huguenots"" had at first been forbidden in Germany, but now it was allowed to be performed. As court composer he wrote a grand opera called ""Ein Feldschlag in Schlesien"" (""A Battle in Silesia""), but it never became internationally famous. The main part in the opera was sung by Jenny Lind."
Return to Paris.
"In 1849 he returned to Paris. He wrote several works together with Scribe, whom Meyerbeer described as the best living librettist, and who was one of his closest friends. His opera ""Le prophète"" (for which Scribe again wrote the words) earned him a lot of money. The great contralto Pauline Viardot-Garcia sang the main part."
"Scribe died in 1861. Meyerbeer worked very hard to try to finish his last opera, ""L’Africaine"". Napoleon III said he wanted the opera to be ready by the winter of 1862-63, but it was not ready until 1864. The work was being rehearsed for its first performance when Meyerbeer suddenly died, without having had the chance to revise it, the way he revised most of his other pieces."
Meyerbeer’s body was taken to Berlin where it was buried in the Jewish cemetery in a vault that belonged to his family.
Meyerbeer’s music.
"Meyerbeer was always more popular in France than in Germany. His operas are about the society of wealthy people. The sounds he made with his orchestra are often deliberately harsh. In this he is like Beethoven in his final years, and Berlioz. Sometimes he used new instruments such as the bass clarinet and the saxophone. He always thought carefully about what his singers were capable of when writing his music. He enjoyed working with different singers, among them Velluti, who was the last of the great operatic castrati. He took great trouble to give his singers rests during the opera so that they would still be in good voice for the climax of the story. He liked scenes with large crowds. He composed his dance music, in particular, very carefully. Often he would throw it away and start again if the dancers were not happy with it."
Foods with a lot of vitamin C include the following:
Ion
An ion is an electrically charged atom or group of atoms.
"It can be made from an atom, or from a group of atoms (molecule). It is ""charged"" so it will move near electricity. This is because atoms are made of three smaller parts:"
"An ion has unequal numbers of protons and electrons. Making an ion from an atom or molecule is called ""ionization""."
"The charge on a proton is chosen as +1 (positively charged). The charge on an electron is opposite to the charge on the proton. The charge on the electron is -1 (negatively charged). An atom that is ionized makes two parts, one positive, and one negatively charged. For example, a neutral hydrogen atom has one proton and one electron. Ionizing the atom breaks it into two parts: (1) a positively charged hydrogen ion, H+ (2) a negatively charged electron."
"A liquid with ions is called an electrolyte. A gas with lots of ions is called a plasma. When ions move, it is called electricity. For example, in a wire, the metal ions do not move, but the electrons move as electricity. A positive ion and a negative ion will move together. Two ions of the same charge will move apart. When ions move they also make ""magnetic fields""."
Many ions are colourless. Elements in the main groups in the Periodic Table form colourless ions. Some ions are coloured. The transition metals usually form coloured ions.
Chemistry.
"In physics, atomic nuclei that have been completely ionized are called charged particles. These are ones in alpha radiation."
Ionization happens by giving atoms high energy. This is done using electrical voltage or by high-energy ionizing radiation or high temperature.
A simple ion is formed from a single atom.
Polyatomic ions are formed from a number of atoms. Polyatomic ions usually consist of all non-metal atoms. But sometimes the polyatomic ion can have a metallic atom too.
"Positive ions are called cations. They are attracted to cathodes (negatively charged electrodes). (""Cation"" is pronounced ""cat eye on"", not ""kay shun"".) All simple metal ions are cations."
"Negative ions are called anions. They are attracted to anodes (positively charged electrodes). All simple non-metal ions (except H+, which is a proton) are anions."
Transition metals can form more than one simple cation with different charges.
"Most ions have a charge of less than 4, but some can have higher charges."
"Michael Faraday was the first person to write a theory about ions, in 1830. In his theory, he said what the portions of molecules were like that moved to anions or cations. Svante August Arrhenius showed how this happened. He wrote this in his doctoral dissertation in 1884 (University of Uppsala). The university did not accept his theory at first (he only just passed his degree). But in 1903, he won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the same idea."
"In Greek ""ion"" is like the word ""go"". ""Anion"" and ""cation"" mean ""up-goer"" and ""down-goer"". ""Anode"" and ""cathode"" are ""way up"" and ""way down""."

Cognitive science
"Cognitive science studies how people make their ideas and what makes thoughts logical. It is often seen as the result of several different scientific fields working together. These fields are psychology (a study of the mind), neuroscience (biological study of the brain), computer science (the creation of programs and computers), and linguistics (the study of language). It does not refer to the sum of all these disciplines. It refers to their intersection on specific problems."
Anthropology
Anthropology is the study of human beings in the past and present.
"The word anthropology has two roots: [ anthrop- ] and [ -ology ]. Anthrop- means “about human beings,” and -ology means “a type of science."" Anthropology is a type of science about human beings. A person who studies anthropology is called an anthropologist."
The main goal of anthropology is to answer the questions: What makes us human and why?
"Anthropology is a biological and historical social science that helps us learn how groups of people are the same, and how they are different in all parts of the world. Anthropologists do research in many places and study how people live now and how they may have lived in the past. They research in modern cities, small villages, tribes, and in the countryside."
Four fields.
American football
"American football, referred to as football in the United States and Canada and also known as gridiron, is a team sport. It is played by two teams with 11 players on each side. American football is played with a ball with pointed ends. Points are scored in many ways, usually by one team getting the ball into the end zone of the other team. The game started in the late 19th century as college football, an American version of rugby football."
"The main leagues that play American football are the professional National Football League (NFL), and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), which plays college football. In the National Football League, players can be paid millions of dollars. In the National Collegiate Athletic Association, players simply play for the pride of their school, scholarships, or for the chance to join a national team. Over a million boys (and a number of girls) play high school football. There is also a closely related sport called Canadian football (CFL)."
Gameplay.
"An American football game is played with a ball called a football. The sport is played on a grass (or artificial turf) field. The field is exactly long and wide. The end zones, one at each end of the field, are long. The players wear protective equipment, including a helmet with face mask, shoulder pads, thigh pads, and often a mouth guard. A team has four chances, or ""downs"", to advance the ball while the opposing team tries to stop it. Certain players advance the ball by carrying or throwing it. Teams can score by advancing the ball to the other team's end zone or by kicking the ball through a goalpost placed at the back of the end zone. American football is carefully regulated by time and rules, which are enforced by officials, who also determine when a team scores."
"A college or professional football game is 60 minutes long, and is divided into 15-minute quarters. In some high schools, the quarters are 12 minutes long, and games for younger children are often shorter still. After the first two quarters, the teams rest during halftime."
"In NFL football, if the game is tied after the four quarters, the two teams compete in at least one more 15-minute period called overtime. During overtime, the first team to score points is usually the winner. However, under the current rules, first used for the 2011 postseason, if the team that has the ball first ends its possession by scoring a field goal, the other team has a chance to score. If that team does not score, or if it scores a touchdown, the game ends. If it scores a field goal, the game continues, and the next team to score wins. During the regular season, only one overtime period is played—if neither team scores, or if both teams score field goals when they first have the ball, the game ends in a tie. During the playoffs, the game will continue with as many overtime periods as needed to decide a winner. If the game is tied after each team has had the ball once in overtime, the first team to score wins."
"In NCAA football overtime, which is based on the system used for high school football in most U.S. states, the teams take turns trying to score. The game ends when one team scores, and the other team fails to score as many points during its chance."
Field.
"American football is played on a field long by wide. Most of the game is played on in the middle. It is divided by 20 lines drawn every . The field has two other sets of markings, running between the two end zones along the length of the field, known as ""hashmarks"". All plays must start between the hashmarks—if the last play ended outside the hashmarks, the ball is moved to the nearest hashmark. At the ends of the field there are scoring areas, called the end zones."
"There are also two yellow poles on the end of each field called uprights. Sometimes, if the team can not score a touchdown they might want to kick it through the uprights for three points. The uprights are also used for scoring one point after a team scored a touchdown."
Players.
"There are many types of players on a football team. For the offensive part of the team, a quarterback throws the football to wide receivers while offensive linemen block to protect him from defensive players. The offensive linemen also block when a running back runs to advance the football. Players on the Defensive line, a linebacker, and defensive backs (cornerbacks and American football safeties) attempt to tackle the offensive player who carries the football."
"Some team members only play during certain times. These players belong to the Special Teams. The kicker can kick the ball to the other team or between the uprights, while the placeholder holds the ball steady. The kick returner runs the ball down the field in an attempt to score points after catching the ball."
Scoring.
Touchdown (6 points).
"A touchdown is achieved when a player has legal possession of the ball and the ball crosses an imaginary vertical plane above the opposing team's goal line. After a touchdown, the scoring team attempts a try for 1 or 2 points (see below). A successful touchdown is signaled by an official extending both arms vertically above the head."
Field goal (3 points).
"A field goal is scored when the ball is place kicked between the goal posts behind the opponent's end zone. The most common type of kick used is the place kick. For a place kick, the ball must first be snapped to a placeholder, who holds the ball upright on the ground with his fingertip so that it may be kicked. Three points are scored if the ball crosses between the two upright posts and above the crossbar and remains over."
Extra point (1 or 2 points).
"Immediately following a touchdown, the scoring team can attempt to kick the ball between the goal posts for 1 extra point. The team can also run or pass the ball into the end zone for 2 points. This is not done very often, although it does happen if the game situation calls for it."
"College football has unique rules regarding extra point attempts in overtime. Teams that score touchdowns are required to attempt a two-point conversion during the second overtime. Starting with the third overtime, the two teams alternate two-point conversion attempts, with the game ending when one team scores and the other does not."
Defensive conversion (2 points).
"In the NFL, college football, and high school football in Texas (whose rules are based on the NCAA set), if the defense takes possession of the ball during an extra point (via fumble, interception, or blocked kick) and returns the ball into the opponent's end zone, the defensive team receives 2 points. (In high school football outside of Texas, if the defense takes possession during an extra point, the play is dead at that moment and the conversion is ruled ""no good"".)"
Safety (2 points).
"A safety is scored if a player causes the ball to become dead in his own end zone. When this happens two points are awarded to the opposing (usually defending) team. This can happen if a player is either downed or goes out of bounds in the end zone while carrying the ball. It can also happen if he fumbles the ball, and it goes out of bounds in the end zone. A safety is also awarded to the defensive team if the offensive team commits a foul which is enforced in its own end zone."
American Professional Seasons.
Exhibition season.
"Exhibition season (better known as Pre-Season) is in August. In the exhibition season, the teams get ready for the regular season by having training. Teams have practices to help the team get better and see who will make the team. All of the teams play 3 games before the regular season starts, and the games do not change what team gets to the post season. Because of it, teams do not use their best players much, and use the games as more practice."
Regular season.
"The 32 NFL teams are divided into two conferences: the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football Conference (AFC). Each of them is divided in four divisions: North, South, West and East. Each division includes four teams."
"Sharks are a superorder of fish, also know by its scientific name Selachimorpha. They, like other Chondrichthyes, have skeletons made of cartilage instead of bone. Cartilage is tough, rubbery material which is less rigid than bone. Cartilaginous fish also include skates and rays."
"There are more than 350 different kinds of sharks, such as the great white and whale sharks. Fossils show that sharks have been around for 420 million years, since the early Silurian."
"Most sharks are predators: they hunt and eat fish, marine mammals, and other sea creatures. However, the largest shark eats krill, like whales. This is the whale shark, the largest fish in the world. It is widely believed that sharks are ""silent killers"". However, a recent study shows that sharks emit a low growl from their throats which resonates through their scales."
"Some common kinds of shark are the hammerhead shark, the great white shark, the tiger shark, and the mako shark. Most sharks are cold-blooded but some, like the great white shark and the mako shark are partially warm-blooded."
"Just a few million years ago, a giant shark called ""Megalodon"" swam in the seas. It was 18 meters long, twice as long as the closely-related great white shark, and it ate whales. ""Megalodon"" died out 1.6 million years ago."
"Much of what we understand about prehistoric sharks comes from the study of their fossils. While sharks have skeletons made of soft cartilage that can fall apart before fossilizing, their teeth are harder and easily fossilized. Prehistoric sharks, like their modern descendants, would grow and shed many thousands of teeth over their lifetime. For this reason shark teeth are one of the most common fossils."

"Sharks come in many different shapes and sizes, but most are long and thin (also called streamlined), with really strong jaws."
"Their teeth are constantly replaced throughout their lives. Sharks eat so violently they often break a few teeth, so new teeth grow continuously in a groove just inside the mouth and move forward from inside the mouth on ""conveyor belts"" formed by the skin which they are attached to. In its lifetime, a shark can lose and regrow as many as 30,000 teeth."
"Even with all those teeth, though, sharks can not chew. So they bite their prey and jerk it around so they can pull off a chunk to swallow. The chunks of food that a shark swallows end up in its stomach, where they are digested. This is pretty slow, however, so a meal might take several days to digest. This is why a shark does not eat every day."
"Sharks have different-shaped teeth, depending on what they eat. For instance, some sharks have sharp, pointy teeth, while bottom dwelling sharks have cone-shaped teeth for crushing shells. Because there are so many different kinds of sharks, and because each kind has its own kind of special teeth, many people enjoy collecting shark teeth. Shark teeth collectors can guess how large a shark was by measuring the shark tooth. First, they measure the length of the tooth in inches. Every inch of tooth equals 10ft of shark length: so if a shark tooth is 2 inches long, the tooth came from a shark that was 20 ft long! Even more terrifying is that some of the ""Megalodon"" teeth are 6 inches long so that suggests a shark 60 feet long."
"Sharks have skin covered in millions of tiny teeth-like scales that point to the tail. If you rub along a shark towards the tail, it feels smooth, but if you rub the other way, it is rough. Sharks' teeth can grow back if they are lost."
Fins.
"The fins of sharks are used for stabilizing, steering, lift and swimming. Each fin is used in a different manner."
"There are one or two fins present along the dorsal midline called the first and second dorsal fin. These fins help the shark from constantly rolling around. These two fins may, or may not have spines. When spines are present, they are used for defensive purposes, and may also have skin glands with them that produce an irritating substance."
The pectoral fins are behind the head and extend outwards. These fins are used for steering during swimming and help to provide the shark with lift.
"The pelvic fins are behind the pectoral fins, near the cloaca, and are also stabilizers."
"Not all sharks have anal fins, but if they do have them, they are found between the pelvic and caudal fins."
"The tail region itself consists of the caudal peduncle and the caudal fin. The caudal peduncle sometimes has notches known as ""precaudal pits"", which are found just ahead of the caudal fin. The peduncle may also be horizontally flattened into lateral keels. The caudal fin has both, an upper lobe, and a lower lobe, that can be of different sizes and the shape depends of which species the shark is."
"The primary use of the caudal fin is to provide a ""push"" while the shark swims. The upper lobe of the caudal fin produces the most amount of the push, and usually forces the shark downwards. The pectoral fins and the shape of the body (like an airfoil) work together to counter this force. The strong, non-lunate caudal fin in most benthic shark species allows the shark to swim close to the seabed (such as the nurse shark). However, the fastest swimming sharks (such as the mako sharks) tend to have lunate-shaped (crescent-shaped) caudal fins."
Senses.
Smell.
Sharks have keen olfactory sense organs in the short duct between the front and back nasal openings. They can detect blood from miles away: as little as one part per million of blood in sea water may be enough.
Sharks have the ability to determine the direction of a given scent based on the timing of scent detection in each nostril. This is similar to the method mammals use to determine direction of sound.
"They are more attracted to the chemicals found in the intestines of many species, and as a result often linger near or in sewage outfalls. Some species, such as nurse sharks, have external barbels that greatly increase their ability to sense prey."
Sight.
"Shark eyes are similar to the eyes of other vertebrates, including similar lenses, corneas and retinas. Their eyesight is well adapted to the marine environment. They can contract and dilate their pupils, like humans, something no teleost fish can do. A tissue behind the retina reflects light back, thereby increasing sight in darker waters."
Sensing electric current.
"Sharks have tiny holes all over the shark's snout, especially between the eye and the tip of the snout. In them are nerve receptors which are called the ""ampullae of Lorenzini."" p23 They can sense electricity in the water. Animals in the water give off electricity: every time an animal's heart beats or it moves, tiny currents of electricity are made. These tiny electric currents make signals that travel through water and get sensed. Sharks may use this sense when they catch their prey, even more than they use their sight."
Hearing.
"Although it is hard to test sharks' hearing, they may have a sharp sense of hearing and can possibly hear prey many miles away. A small opening on each side of their heads (not the spiracle) leads directly into the inner ear through a thin channel."
Lateral line.
Penguins only live south of the equator. Several different kinds live in and around Antarctica. The biggest ones can stand nearly 4 feet (1.2m) tall and can weigh almost 100 pounds (40 kg). The smallest kinds are only about one foot (30 cm) tall. Penguins are large birds that swim very well but cannot fly. They have black backs and wings with white fronts. Their feathers are very tightly packed and make a thick cover. They also have a layer of woolly down under the feathers. The feathers themselves are coated with a type of oil that makes them waterproof. A thick layer of blubber also keeps them warm. Penguins eat fish and are at home in the ocean. They come up on the land or ice to lay their eggs and raise the chicks. They nest together in a huge group.
Largest land animal.
The largest animal in Antarctica that lives entirely on land is a wingless midge.
History of its discovery.
"For a long time, people had believed that there was a great continent in the far south of Earth. They thought this ""Terra Australis"" would ""balance"" the lands in the north like Europe, Asia and North Africa. People have believed this from the times of Ptolemy (1st century AD). He suggested this idea to keep the balance of all known lands in the world. Pictures of a large land in the south were common in maps. In the late 17th century, people discovered that South America and Australia were not part of the mythical ""Antarctica"". However, geographers still believed that Antarctica was much bigger than it really was."
"European maps continued to show this unknown land until Captain James Cook's ships, HMS ""Resolution"" and ""Adventure"", crossed the Antarctic Circle on 17 January 1773, in December 1773. They crossed it again in January 1774. In fact, Cook did come within about of the Antarctic coast. However, he was forced to go back because of ice in January 1773."
"The first confirmed sighting of Antarctica were by three different men. According to different organizations, ships captained by three men saw Antarctica in 1820. The three men were Fabian von Bellingshausen (a captain in the Russian Imperial Navy), Edward Bransfield (a captain in the Royal Navy), and Nathaniel Palmer (an American seal hunter out of Stonington, Connecticut). The first recorded landing on mainland Antarctica was by the American sealer John Davis. He landed on West Antarctica on 7 February 1821. However, some historians are not sure about this claim."
"People began discovering different parts of Antarctica and mapping them. This was slow work because they could only work in the summer. At last a map was made, and people began to talk about exploring the land, not only the sea. However, this would have been very hard work. They would have to break through the ice that was around Antarctica. Then they would have to land on it and bring in enough things to live on while they explored the land."
"The first serious exploration of the Antarctic land was the Nimrod Expedition led by Ernest Shackleton in 1907–09. They were the first to climb Mount Erebus and to reach the South Magnetic Pole. Shackleton himself and three other members of his expedition made several firsts in December 1908 – February 1909. They were the first humans to cross the Ross Ice Shelf, and the Transantarctic Mountain Range (via the Beardmore Glacier). They were the first to set foot on the South Polar Plateau."
"Robert Falcon Scott, the most well known of all of the explorers, wanted to be the first man to reach the South Pole. At the same time, another team from Norway lead by Roald Amundsen started. They both raced each other to the South Pole, but in the end Amundsen won because he had made a good use of his sleigh dogs. Scott had used ponies and motor sleds, but when he got to the South Pole he found a message from Amundsen, showing that he had beaten Scott."
"On his way back, Scott and three companions met a blizzard and froze to death while waiting for it to finish. The people who found him eight months later also found his records and diary, which he had written to the day he died."
"Climate change and global warming are showing effects in Antarctica, particularly the Antarctic Peninsula."
People.
"No one lives in Antarctica all the time. People who go to Antarctica are there to learn about Antarctica, so most of the people who live there are scientists. Most live at national science stations on the coast. Some bases are far from the sea, for example at the South pole. They study the weather, animals, glaciers, and the Earth's atmosphere. Some scientists drill ice cores to find out about the weather long ago. People who work in the Antarctic must be careful, because a blizzard can start any time and anywhere. When they go far away from their shelter, they must always take lots of food just in case."
"Today, people explore Antarctica using snowmobiles, which are faster than dogs and can pull heavier loads. Many come to Antarctica just for a short visit. There are companies in South America that have vacations to Antarctica, so people pay to go there on a ship. Some people take their own boats."
South Pole
"The South Pole is the most southern point on the Earth. It is in Antarctica and is the center of the Southern Hemisphere. From the South pole, everywhere is North."
"The geographic North and South poles are the poles the earth spins around, the ones people see on a globe where all the north–south lines meet. These poles stay in the same place, and are usually the ones we mean if we just say North or South Pole. People can tell that they are at these poles by looking at the stars (at the poles, a star just circles around at the same height, never dipping to the horizon). The Sun rises once a year and gives the South Pole half a year of summer but it is always cold. When the Sun sets half a year later it makes half a year of winter which is even colder. The South Pole is always cold because the Sun never rises high in the sky."
"The south magnetic pole is something different. It is defined by the Earth's magnetic field, as roughly where a magnetic compass needle points. People can tell they are near these poles by looking at a compass."
Exploration.
"The South Pole is hard to reach. Unlike the North pole, which is covered by the sea and flat sea-ice, the South Pole is on a mountainous continent. This continent is called Antarctica. It is covered by thick ice (more than a mile thick in the centre). The south Pole is very high up, and is very windy. It is far from places where people live, and ships going there often have to find their way through thick sea ice. Once ashore, land-travelling explorers have to travel more than a thousand miles to get to the pole. They must cross a floating ice shelf, then up onto the ice-covered land, up steep mountain glaciers covered in broken, twisted ice slowly sliding to the sea, and across a high level land (""plateau"") covered in ice and swept by strong freezing winds."
"Two expeditions early in the 20th century, led by Robert Falcon Scott and then Ernest Shackleton, failed to reach the South Pole, but returned safely. Shackleton turned back quite close to the pole, but it was late in the season and supplies were low. He knew that he would be risking the lives of his men, so he turned back."
"The first men to reach the South Pole were a group from Norway led by Roald Amundsen. They arrived at the Pole on December 14, 1911 and left the Norwegian flag. Amundsen and his men returned home safely. Amundsen's story is one of excellent planning, good leadership, and willingness to learn from others: this made extreme endurance unnecessary, and perhaps made the successful expedition less of a story, and therefore perhaps less famous, than the next one."
"The most famous South Pole expedition is perhaps the one that failed badly. This was the British expedition (not just UK, it included people from the British Empire, who at that time were considered British citizens) led by Robert Falcon Scott. Scott and four other men, dragging their equipment on sledges, had hoped to be first to the Pole. When they arrived, they saw a Norwegian flag. A letter left for Scott showed that Amundsen and his men had beaten them by a month, by using dogs to pull their sledges."
"On their journey back from the Pole, Scott's team found that food ""dumps"" were short of supplies, particularly kerosene. Kerosene was very important: not just for cooking but for melting ice. Once it ran out, they would have no water to drink. One man collapsed and died while walking. Oates knew his frostbitten feet could not carry him back to base, and that he might delay his companions and risk their lives. He committed suicide by walking out of their tent into the cold. Scott and his remaining two companions died of starvation, thirst, and cold - trapped in the tent by bad weather until their supplies ran out. Next spring, the three bodies in the tent were found by a team from the main part of the expedition - who had spent the winter in the expeditions's hut by the sea. Scott's letters to his wife, written in the tent when he knew he was going to die, have just (Jan 2007) been made public."
"Apart from Ernest Shackleton's expedition to cross the Antarctic (another heroic failure, but Shackleton saved all his men, after a very courageous sea crossing in an open boat, and a crossing of an unknown mountain range while starving and freezing), this was the end of the ""heroic"" age of exploration. Motors, Planes, Radios, and GPS ensured that following expeditions were never truly ""unsupported""."
Today there is an American science base at the South Pole. It is named the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station to honor the two explorers.
Climate.
"The South Pole has a desert climate. It almost never gets any precipitation. Air humidity is near zero. However, high winds can cause the blowing of snowfall, and the accumulation of snow amounts to about per year. The former dome seen in pictures of the Amundsen-Scott station is partially buried due to snow storms, and the entrance to the dome had to be regularly bulldozed to uncover it. More recent buildings are raised on stilts so that the snow does not build up against the sides."
Indian Ocean
Gosport
"Gosport is a town in Hampshire, England. The population of Gosport is around 78,000"
Indonesian language
"Indonesian language () is the national and official language of Indonesia and is used in the entire country. It is a form of the Malay language. It is the language of official communication, taught in schools and used for broadcast in electronic and digital media. Being the top multilingual (especially trilingual) country in the world, most Indonesians also speak their own ethnic or native languages, with the most widely spoken being Javanese and Sundanese which consequently give huge influence into the Indonesian language itself."
"With huge speakers throughout the country as well as by the diaspora who live abroad, Indonesian language is listed as one of the most spoken languages worldwide. Indonesian language also officially taught and used in schools, universities, and institutions worldwide, especially in Australia, Netherlands, Japan, South Korea, Timor Leste, Vietnam, Taiwan, United States of America, United Kingdom, etc."
"Having a long-established historical ties with European countries since the colonialism era, some of Indonesian terms has absorbed into some European languages, mainly the Dutch and English. Indonesian language itself also has numerous loanwords which derived from the European languages, mainly from the Dutch, Portuguese, Spanish, and English. Indonesian language also has loanwords derived from Sanskrit, Chinese, and Arabic which diffused in Indonesian due to the trade and religious-based activities that had been done since ancient times within the Indonesian archipelago region."
All in the Family
"All in the Family is an American situation comedy that aired on CBS from 1971 to 1979. It is about a working class family who live in Queens, New York City. The main character is Archie Bunker. The show deals with many controversial issues (including abortion and racism). The sitcom was created by Norman Lear and it was developed by Lear and Bud Yorkin. It is based on the British sitcom ""Till Death Us Do Part"" which was made by Johnny Speight. Carroll O'Connor, Jean Stapleton, Sally Struthers, Rob Reiner, and Danielle Brisebois are the main actors on the show."
"""All in the Family"" is seen in the United States of America as one of the greatest television programs in history. The show did not do good in the first season but the a lot more people watched when CBS put in the summer reruns on television. Many people liked that the show talked about controversial issues. The show got number 1 on the Nielsen ratings from 1971 to 1976. It was the first television show to do this. The episode ""Sammy Visit's"" was number 13 on ""TV Guides 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time and ""TV Guides 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time had ""All in the Family"" as the fourth greatest show of all time. Bravo put Archie Bunker as the ""greatest character of all time."" ""All in the Family"" had seven spin-off shows made. That is the most spin-off shows from any show ever."
"The show ended on April 8, 1979 but the spin-off show called ""Archie Bunker's Place"" started on September 23, 1979 and carried on with Archie Bunker until 1984. 15 years later Norman Lear created ""704 Hauser"" which was about a new family living in Archie Bunker's house after he sold it. The show was ended early after five episodes were put on television."
Plot.
"""All in the Family"" is about a family who lives during the early 1970s in the suburbs of Queens, New York City. The sitcom's main character is a World War II veteran and blue-collar worker Archie Bunker. Archie Bunker is old, a bigot, and is not very smart. He gets mad at the changes he sees in the world and wants to go back to when life was more easier. Archie does not like the Democratic Party and is a Republican. He stereotypes every person he meets. His wife, Edith Bunker is a nice woman but she is not very smart. She has a very big family but her family does not like Archie Bunker. Archie and Edith have one child. They have a daughter named Gloria Stivic who is a feminist. Archie calls Gloria ""little girl"". Gloria is married to Michael Stivic who is unemployed and is of Polish descent. Archie calls Michael the ""Meathead"" because Michael has different ideas about politics then Archie. Michael and Gloria have a son together. Archie thinks that Michael is dead from his neck to his head. Archie does not like the Jeffersons who are the African American family that live next door to them. Archie argues with George Jefferson many times but George's wife is a friends with Edith. Her name is Louise Jefferson. George and Louise have a son named Lionel Jefferson who helps out Archie. The Jeffersons move away and into the city. Edith also has a cousin named Maude Findlay who takes care of the Bunkers when they get sick. Archie argues with Maude many times because they do not have the same opinions about politics. The characters who live around Archie and his family are meant to show the changing demographics in the world, which Archie does not like."
Early seasons of the show.
"During the show the family goes through different situations. Many of the most funny moments of the show are in the first season. Early in the show, Michael wrote an angry letter to President Richard Nixon and Archie wrote a letter to Richard Nixon about why he liked him. Archie and the Jeffersons argue over the color of God's skin because he does not think God is black. But Archie gets drunk and is locked in the basement and he thinks that God came to rescue him but it was just one of the Jeffersons. He is surprised that God is black and bows down to him. In many of the episodes Michael and Archie argue. One time Archie was nearly arrested for owning tear gas and another time he went missing. Archie and the people he works with go on strike and Archie does not have a job. But Edith gets a job instead because the family needs money. This makes Archie mad because he thinks that the husband should be working. There are also some flashback episodes. The first one is about the first time Archie and Michael meet. It is a very famous episode and Michael got the name ""meathead"" in it. In the third season the episode,""The Bunkers and the Swingers"" won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series. The episode was about Edith an Archie not knowing that they agreed to change husbands and wives for a night with other people who do it as a job."
Later seasons of the show.
"Later on, Archie is in a broken elevator with a woman who Archie thought was crazy, an African American businessman and a Puerto Rican man and women who is about to give birth. In season eight of the show Gloria and Michael move out of the house and move into their own house to raise their son but the house is very close to Archie and Edith's house. Michael and Gloria start to argue many times and they think they might get divorced. Michael looks to Archie for help but it does not work very much. They do stayed married for the rest of the show. Archie's ideas about transgender people are put to test when he saved a transgender person's life not knowing that they were transgender. Many important and controversial things happen in season eight of the show. During the episode ""Edith's 50th Birthday"" a man who is dressed up as a police officer tried to rape Edith. Edith fights him off but has a very hard time telling Archie about it. Another time Archie and Michael are locked in Kelsey's Bar together and they argue but become very close and Archie finally tells Michael that he loves him. Later in the show Archie and Edith raise a young girl named Stephanie Mills who was abandoned by her father and her mother (Edith's cousin). Archie buys a bar with a friend and they own it. The story of ""All in the Family"" continued in ""Archie Bunker's Place"" and the house is the main place with a new family named the ""Cumberbatches"" in the spin-off show ""704 Hauser"" but the show was cancelled less than a month after it started."
Creating the show.
The first pilot episode.
"""All in the Family"" is based on the 1960s British sitcom television show ""Till Death Us Do Part"". Norman Lear said he read about the show in a ""Variety"" magazine. He thought the show was like the relationship that he had with his father. Norman Lear bought the rights to use ""Til Death Us Do Part"" and used the ideas of the show in ""All in the Family"". Norman Lear is the creator of ""All in the Family"". He would also add some of the things his father did into the show. CBS wanted to have the show but the show was going to be on ABC. There was two pilot episodes made. One was made on September 3, 1968 and called ""And Justice For All"". The pilot episodes had different actors and actresss for Michael (Tim McIntire) and Gloria Stivic (Kelly Jean Peters) and the house they lived in looked different. Archie and Edith were named ""Archie Justice"" and ""Edith Justice"" instead of Archie Bunker and Edith Bunker. Micheal was named “Dickie” for the first pilot. Lionel Jefferson was played by D'Urville Martin instead of Mike Evans. For the start of the episode, Archie and Edith were singing, ""Those were the Days"" but the song was longer and shots of where they lived were shown but not them. Also Edith played the piano faster in this pilot episode then the rest of the show. The camera showed the door mat which said ""Justice"" before the episode started. The pilot was taped with three cameras so the people watching could see the characters feelings about things. This would be used for the entire show. Most other sitcoms used one camera but ""All in the Family"" was the first and more sitcoms used three cameras after. The pilot talked about many important issues instead of just one. The characters talked about race, welfare, antisemitism, and even different types of sausage. The ending credits of the pilot episode is the kitchen room with the party decorations up. Edith and Archie are singing the same song from the beginning as the credits roll."
The second pilot episode.
"ABC did not like the first pilot because they did not think Archie and Edith were good together but ABC gave Lear the money to make a second pilot. The episode was made on February 10, 1969 in Los Angeles and it was called ""Those were Days"". The second pilot episode was almost the same as the first pilot episode but in this pilot Gloria was played by Candice Azzara and Chip Oliver played Richard. Richard was the name of Michael Stivic's character and was named ""Dickie"" in the first pilot episode. D'Urville Martin played Lionel Jefferson again. Another difference from the pilot episodes and the rest of the show is that Edith can be rude to Archie at times and calls Archie,""Mr. Religion."" For the start of this pilot episode, Edith and Archie are singing ""Those were the Days"" the same way it would be for the rest of the show. After Edith and Archie start to sing, shots of the neighborhood that they live in are shown but not Manhattan. The ending credits are Archie and Edith singing the same song but they are not shown. Instead the same shots from the opening song is shown but backwards. This was used for the rest of the show."
"The pilots both had the same story. Gloria and Richard are making a surprise anniversary party for Edith and Archie. Gloria does not want Richard to argue with Archie. Their friend, Lionel Jefferson was fixing the toilet for them. When Richard and Gloria leave Archie and Edith come home, Edith is surprised to see the party. But when Richard and Gloria come back, Richard and Archie start to argue about controversial ideas. Gloria tells Archie that she is going to leave because they keep arguing but she does not. Lionel comes back to the house and Archie tries to show Richard that he likes African-Americans but insults Jewish people instead. Lionel and Richard play a joke on Archie and try to make him think that he is Jewish. Edith opens a present from Archie but he did not make it. She is very happy but Archie is confused. The episodes end with Archie insulting Richard."
Making the rest of the show.
"This was the last pilot and it would be two years until the first episode of the ""All in the Family"" was made. Both of the pilot episodes were never put on television. ABC did not like the show because they thought it was too controversial and because another show, ""Turn-On"" was ended after one episode. They also thought that the people who watch ABC would not like Archie Bunker. Norman Lear and Bud Yorkin took back the screenplay and thought about making a movie with ""All in the Family"" and not a show because Norman and Bud has made good movies. Norman Lear had a meeting with United Artists about making movies and Bud had a meeting with CBS. CBS thought about getting ""All in the Family"" back. Norman Lear and Bud Yorkin agreed to make 13 episodes for the first season and CBS bought the show back."
"The show was filmed at CBS Television City in Hollywood from 1971 to 1975 and then was filmed at Metromedia Square also in Hollywood, from 1975 to 1979. Tandem Productions was the company that produced the show. Norman Lear and Bud Yorkin created the company. Norman Lear wanted the show to be made in black and white but CBS would not let him. The furniture in the show did not have many colors in them this was because Norman Lear wanted the people watching the show to make it feel like they were looking at family photos. ""All in the Family"" was the first American sitcom to be recorded in front of a live audience. Each episode is 25 or 26 minutes long. CBS had a warning before each episode to warn the people watching that controversial topics would be talked about on the show, but they did it too make people laugh. CBS did this so people would know before the show started if they were going to be offended by what was on the show. Rob Reiner and Sally Struthers played Michael and Gloria instead and the first episode was put on television on January 12, 1971."
"""All in the Family"" was not famous in the first season. But the show started to become famous when CBS had reruns of the first season on television."
Setting and location.
"""All in the Family"" takes place Astoria which is a neighbourhood in the Queens, New York. Many episodes of the show take place at Archie and Edith's house. The address for the house Archie and his family is 704 Hauser but the address is not real. The house is real and is in Greendale also in New York. The Bunker's live near New York State Route 25A which is where Kelsey's Bar is and where ""Archie Bunker's Place"" is set. Many of the places mentioned in the show are real. Like the high school that Archie Bunker goes too is a real high school in Flushing, New York."
Cultural impact.
"Most sitcoms before ""All in the Family"" did not talk about controversial issues. ""All in the Family"" became very famous because it talked about controversial topics like race and sexuality but in a funny way. Many people liked the show because they thought the show was relatable for them because the show was about average people in the 1970s. Norman Lear used this when he made other shows like ""Sanford and Son"". ""All in the Family"" won many awards for it's success. The chairs that Archie Bunker and Edith sit in and the table that is in between the chairs are on display at the National Museum of American History. On the table is Archie's favorite beer and a bowl to stop his cigar when he is done smoking. The hat that Archie wears on the show is also at this museum."
"I got one from Oklahoma City, and one from California."
Did you?
"And that was, uh, California,"
"I was thrilled to death, because that's, you know, the furthest I'd gotten any call from, you know,"
"and, um,"
"Yeah,"
"I got, I've talked to people in Utah, people in New York"
"Oh, really."
and a lot of times I'll call eight or nine o'clock in the morning
"and I'll get people you know, from out of the, uh, out of the state."
Oh.
"Yeah,"
"see, well that's, uh, the, there was another call on Saturday, Saturday that was also from, uh, that was the one from California."
"I don't know why I ask people on the weekends from out of state,"
"or, uh, I don't know, you know,"
"but,"
I'll be darned.
Where you from?
Not from Texas.
"Uh, originally from New Jersey."
"New Jersey,"
right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
My wife's from New Jersey.
"Oh, really,"
what part?
"Yeah,"
"from, uh, Saddle River."
"Oh, that's nice over there."
"She,"
"Yeah,"
"my family, uh, didn't like Texas,"
"and I had a chance to, uh, transfer up."
"T I bought a company about seven months after I moved to Texas, right here in ."
That's nice.
"So I got an opportunity to transfer back,"
and I took it.
"God,"
that's great.
"Uh, I'm a native Texan."
Uh-huh.
West Texan.
Yeah.
There is a difference.
"Yeah,"
"believe me,"
I know there is.
"I lived in Plano,"
and I don't know if you're familiar with Plano
Yeah.
"but Plano, maybe five percent of the Plano actually were from Texas."
Everybody else was an import.
"Well, I'm a West Texan."
Uh-huh.
"Lubbock, Midland Odessa Amarillo, Dumas, Panhandle."
Yes.
Yeah.
A different world from down there.
Yeah.
"So, uh, Colorado's been fun."
But they have a real problem.
Next to every window the state seems to have put up a turnstile.
"And every time you look at a, look at the mountains or think about looking at the mountains, you got to throw in a dollar."
"and, uh,"
"Oh yeah,"
that's right.
"It, it might have one best picture, too."
Yes
"it did,"
yes
it did.
Yeah.
"Just as RAIN MAN, uh, with Dustin Hoffman, uh, that, that was tremendous and Tom Cruise."
"That was,"
"yeah,"
"I, I think it was more a lesson for Tom Cruise than anything else in terms of, uh, of how to act from Dustin Hoffman,"
"but, uh."
"Yes,"
"uh, oh, that was, that was, uh, what the, much of the hype was that Tom Cruise learned so much from Dustin Hoffman."
"Yeah,"
"it must have been great just being with him on, on a daily basis and seeing how he prepares for his, for his lines and all that stuff."
Yeah
"and a good bit of that was filmed right in Cincinnati. Which is just forty-five miles from, from where I am, where I actually live in a suburb of Dayton."
Oh.
"Is, is the Kmart there?"
"Oh, we do have Kmart here,"
you better believe it.
Isn't there a Kmart everywhere?
"That was, that was so funny,"
"he had to,"
or was it Kmart.
Yes.
He had to buy his underwear at Kmart.
"Right,"
right
"Oh, you grew up in Orlando."
Uh-huh.
"That's, uh, that's interesting, Well, I was in submarines. Uh,"
"Well, that's what I worked on."
"Okay,"
"yeah,"
"must have had some interesting, uh, assignments for you there."
when did you retire?
The end of last month.
"Well, great."
I'm sure you've seen some interesting developments in acoustics.
I certainly have
Yeah.
"So, I hate to, uh,"
"I wish I could talk to you about that, uh,"
"but, uh, I guess we should continue on, uh,"
Okay.
Okay.
Right.
"Where's,"
How do you like Chinese food?
"Oh, we, we do enjoy that."
"Yes, sir."
"Uh, I don't know if we are particularly adventurous,"
"we find something we like, uh, like cashew shrimp or something that's got a good, uh, at a particular restaurant"
and then we usually stick by it.
"But do you,  What about you?"
Uh-huh.
"Well, I, uh, enjoy the Szechuan type of, uh, Chinese food."
Hot?
Yes.
Uh-huh.
"and it's, it's pretty maintenance free, you know,"
"and, uh, at the beginning of the year last year and drove a Chevrolet Cavalier station wagon"
and it didn't give me any trouble at all.
That's good.
Yeah.
"It was a late model,"
is that Chrysler van?
It's a eighty-seven.
"Yeah,"
one of the little mini vans?
"Uh-huh,"
yeah.
"Is a,"
Do you like the way it rides and stuff?
"Uh, rides or runs?"
Rides rough?
"It,"
"yeah,"
"well, yeah,"
"it rides, rides rough,"
it runs good.
Yeah.
"You know, I kind of,"
it took me a while to get used to a four cylinder engine.
Yeah.
"You have to kind of wait for it, especially when you get on the highway."
"Yeah,"
"right now, without getting some of the sportier models, uh, the four cylinders aren't real peppy."
Yeah.
"But, uh, they're starting to change that out in the last couple of years, too."
"You driven American cars all,"
"Uh, yeah,"
"I started back when it wasn't, stylish to do that at all."
My daughter that's seventeen now I worked even when she was a baby.
Uh-huh.
Oh.
And I had private care for both my daughters until they were two
"and then I was really lucky to have put them in a, Methodist day school at Preston Hollow Methodist, right off  of Walnut Hill and Preston."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And it was a wonderful environment.
"I, I just wish all kids, if they have to be put in day school, could have that kind of place"
Uh-huh.
I see.
"So, it worked well."
Oh.
How about you?
"Well, I have, uh, a nine year old and a six year old"
"and neither one of them has ever been in in, uh, day care for the reason of, of me working"
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"but, uh, they both went through preschool."
Yeah.
"And, uh, we've just been real lucky  I think, anyway. To not,"
Uh-huh.
It's not hard to find anything that's part-time.
So many of the churches have really strong  preschool and children's day out
"Right,"
like half day programs.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"but, it was a nightmare back when Cheryl was little"
and this is one of the few churches that did it.
There were a couple downtown Dallas
"we're from more, uh, from sort of towards the shore, central  New Jersey, you know,"
Okay.
"we're like, uh,"
"Well, that's nice, too."
"Yeah,"
"oh yeah,"
"it was beautiful,"
"that's why I, I really miss it."
"I, I don't really like it here at all"
"Really,"
"yes,"
"my wife's been away for twenty-five years,"
so she's been away for quite a while.
Uh-huh.
"Her dad was from Little Rock, Arkansas,"
"and her mother was from New York,"
so they just they over there in New Jersey.
"Yeah,"
"so they,"
Yeah
"Uh, and anyway, this topic is, is a good topic, as far as invasion of your privacy,"
"but that's the, the biggest one I can think of is just, just all the solicitors calling."
"Well, yeah,"
"I mean,"
"yeah,"
"yeah,"
"and, then, of course they call, you know,"
"before I got the answering machine, it was ridiculous"
I know.
"you know, I said, this is absurd,"
"I, you know, I, the minute I get home the phone would be ringing."
"That's a, that's a good suggestion."
Uh-huh.
"But I think that, uh, all, with all the perks that we've given them,"
"I mean, I heard on the radio back a, a few weeks ago, uh, during the incidents where they were, you know, like they aren't paying their, their restaurant bills"
and they're bouncing checks all over the place
Uh-huh
Uh-huh.
"uh, one of the radio stations over here listed off every single one of the perks."
"Well, we have,"
"we used to, when I was younger"
Yeah.
we'd go every weekend.
All right .
But we haven't done whole lot of it lately.
Yeah.
I'm kind of into it.
"I'm, uh, kind of a sailor."
Yeah.
"I'm up in Minneapolis now,"
but I was in Florida
"so, uh, yeah,"
I was kind of into it for a while there.
Were you sailboating?
"Yeah,"
for the most part.
Yeah
Yeah.
"I had a little sail,"
"Well, we don't get to do a whole lot of that up here"
No
"Just motorboat's all we,"
What part of Texas you from?
"Uh, Nacogdoches."
"and I say that's great, why not, you know."
"Oh, my,"
uh-huh.
"Yes,"
"why not because that's a, a lot of times, well, it's,"
"I believe that, uh, we in that category,"
and I'm not in that category quite yet
No.
"but, we are seasoned minds."
"Oh, yeah,"
you're really ready to learn finally.
"Yes,"
uh-huh.
"I mean, I don't know why I even went to college when I was seventeen."
"Yeah,"
"it was,"
It was a complete waste of money.
"Yeah,"
"settle down,"
"we know what we're wanting to, to, uh, study"
"and, uh we know our limitations."
"Right,"
right.
"We,"
Right
"and, uh,"
And we don't try to burn the candle at both ends and in the middle altogether.
No.
We don't go out drinking beer till three and try to go to class in the morning
"At seven,"
yeah.
"We're past, yeah, we're past that age"
I wonder how truthful all of that was or whether there was fiction.
"Yeah,"
"I, I imagine a lot of it had to be fictional just to keep the F B I, uh, going, I guess."
"Yeah,"
"well, they keep it rather secretive,"
yes
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"Well the most recent movie I saw, uh, I'm afraid was, uh,"
"well two, two of them actually."
"Uh, the RAIN MAN was one."
Oh that was great one.
"Wasn't that fabulous,"
"and, and DRIVING MISS DAISY."
"Oh, I loved it."
"You know, I haven't seen that one yet,"
and I need to go see it.
"Oh, you need to see that."
Yeah.
That is the most heart rendering story of relationships between two people. Two diametrically opposed people from the stand point that one was Jewish and one was black
Uh-huh.
and this all took place in the South.
Oh my.
"And, uh, normally never the twain shall meet."
"You bet, especially in the South."
"Yes,"
"right,"
"and, um, uh, it, it really was a fantastic movie."
The acting was phenomenal.
"Well as, it, as I recall it got some Academy Awards, didn't it."
"Oh yes,"
Jessica Tandy won best actress
I mean
You know
"But it is nice,"
"it is a, it is really a nice area."
"I, I had a friend from England visit once at Christmas,"
and we could not get her out of the what she called the English back garden. Because she wanted to go back with a sunburn.
"Oh, really?"
Oh.
And she went back to the north of England with a sunburn
"Oh, good heavens"
Not me
I avoid the sun
"Well, yeah,"
"basically I do, too."
"Yeah,"
"it takes me about four and a half hours to do, to mow our grass."
And I try to cover up when I do the lawn
"Well, I, that, that is really healthier, frankly."
"Yeah,"
"well, I have had a little, a couple of problems"
"and, uh, I decided it is not worth it."
Uh-huh.
"That,"
"I, I like to get tan in the Summer time because I think you look healthier."
"And, uh, we are just crazy"
"But you, you know, it is interesting because you get out in that sun an awful lot."
"Now my sister is a, a sun fiend."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, she is five years younger than me,"
she is more wrinkled.
Is that right?
"Yeah,"
Take it easy.
Uh-huh.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye
All rightie.
Okay.
Do you have a budget that you go on?
Yeah.
I sure do.
"Uh, I have, it's pretty much a ledger sheet"
"and I just write down all my bills, how much I'm going to have to pay"
and I do it per paycheck for me which is every other week.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I mean I include everything from groceries to insurance to car payments to credit card payments, you know, everything."
Uh-huh.
And it tends to work out pretty well that way.
"I can anticipate, you know, a little better."
I usually try to guesstimate
"and then when the bill actually comes in, I go ahead and fill in the actual amount."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
That way I know how much pocket change I'm going to have left at the end of the month  or at the end of the paycheck anyway.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
Uh-huh
So that works okay for me.
Uh-huh.
"Well, my bills I usually know approximately how much they're going to be."
Right.
"Each month they are more or less just about the same, you know."
"Uh-huh,"
I worked for P I E
"and then, uh, they went bankrupt"
so I just went ahead and took my early pension.
Uh-huh.
"Oh, uh-huh."
But I only get that once a month.
"Oh, that's tough."
Yeah
My roommate only gets paid once a month
and that last week's pretty lean generally speaking
Yeah.
"So,"
so.
Yeah.
"So, you know, I really have to try to budget, that I don't go over that amount, you know, each month."
Right.
"I, for, for years got paid once a month"
"and, and in ways I liked it because I could go ahead and pay all my bills at once."
Uh-huh.
"There's always one or two stragglers that usually they were,"
for me it worked out that they were the smaller ones
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
but I would pay all of them at one sitting
"and I would know okay, you can go spend this much on groceries now and you get this much a week and that is it."
"Yeah,"
right.
"And, and it worked okay for me."
Uh-huh.
I don't know.
"And,"
"Right now I, I'm in the mode of trying to dig out of debt, I think as everybody is"
"and that, that's true, uh, uh, you know,"
"the, the water was murky,"
and I would hate to think about catching fish or anything there
Huh-uh.
"huh-uh,"
no
I wouldn't want to eat them.
"No,"
"So,"
"no,"
no.
Yeah.
You went to Galveston.
"Uh, I have a favorite hotel that extends out over the water"
Uh-huh.
"the, uh, what is it, the Flagship?"
Yes.
Uh-huh.
Is it still there?
It sure is.
I like that place.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"It most certainly is, so, uh, so that, it, it was, it was certain things that were enjoyable about it,"
"but, uh, I don't, I think it's lost a lot of it's appeal since then, because of all the oil spills that they have had,"
"and, uh, it always smelled the entire time we were there."
"It was,"
"I didn't realize that had happened, for some reason."
Yeah.
"We went swimming one time, in the whole week that, we were there,"
"and the rest of the time we stayed in the pool, because the water was so awful,"
"and,"
"and, and he really,"
"I don't know,"
"he, he's kind of a Dustin Hoffman fan anyway."
But he but before he saw the movie he was like disappointed that Dustin Hoffman would do this
"I'm like, oh, come on."
Just think of what a phenomenal actor Dustin Hoffman is.
Yeah.
"He will do that, to research it and to be able to mimic a person, uh, uh, with the kinds of problems that he had."
And to make it believable.
Yes.
"I mean I was, I was believing it,"
I don't know about any body else
"but I was, it was great."
"Well, I'm sure everybody that saw it was believing it right along with them."
He did great.
"Well it's just, uh, been delightful talking with you."
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
you take care up there
"and, uh, let's hear it for the summertime."
"Absolutely,"
"I'm ready for it,"
but they're predicting some more snow for our direction.
"No,"
oh no.
"Oh well, take care."
Take care now.
"Bye, bye."
"Bye, bye."
Where do you get most of your news?
"I watch the MACNEIL LEHRER news hour,"
and I subscribe to the paper on the weekends.
"I, I've been working,"
"we're going to have a baby this summer,"
and I'm not going to work anymore.
"Oh, how exciting."
Yeah.
"So hopefully, I think I'll enjoy cooking more, when I don't have to work all day."
I don't like to come home and stand in the kitchen and spend an hour fixing something and then have to clean it up
"and by then it's eight thirty or nine o'clock at night,"
so.
Yeah.
"Well I usually start about six and, an, and cook and then eat at seven. I mean, cook at five and eat at six, rather."
Yeah.
"Eat at six, yeah."
"Yeah,"
"and, uh, my family and I, we're a sit down together family."
"Oh, that's good."
"Uh, yeah,"
I don't like the run in and out part.
Yeah.
"And I like to be able to sit down after school and have them talk with me an, and my husband about what's happened"
"and, I think I, that was ingrained in me during my family time at home."
"Yeah,"
that's neat.
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, you know we could learn to talk about things"
and I think that's good.
"Yeah,"
that really is.
It keeps the family in touch with what's going on with each other.
Yeah.
"I think,"
Right now we eat in front of the T V
"Uh, it seems to me, from what I've been able to find out."
"Yeah,"
good.
That's considered a pretty good program.
"It's nice and small, which means, you know, if you don't get the class this semester, then you've got to wait or three or four you know, anywhere from two to four semesters to get,  it again."
Huh
"But, uh, it's worth it once you get it."
"Well, yes,"
that's good.
"And probably a good, uh, student teacher ratio and things."
"Oh, yeah,"
yeah.
Yeah
Most the class are pretty small.
Good.
That works out real well.
"Well, I, I was wondering what, if you all were to get a pet, like if you were to move into an apartment"
"or a house somewhere, what would you get?"
"Uh, well, um, first off we'd probably wind up with a, a cat or maybe a puppy."
Uh-huh.
"I, I, I'm partial towards the larger dogs."
Uh-huh.
"Um, our last, we've, we've had a couple of cats before we moved on campus."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, had a hamster or two,"
"and they, they got,  to be a lot of fun."
A hamster.
"Oh, yeah."
"Uh, it's amazing how much character,"
Okay.
Your family have reunions on a regular basis?
"Probably, once every five years."
"I, I was pretty fortunate this Christmas"
"I didn't get in debt,"
so.
"Oh, that's good."
"I'm taking like, uh, sewing lessons to try to learn how to sew better than what I can"
Uh-huh.
so I won't have to go out and buy the ready-made clothes anymore.
"Oh, uh-huh."
It's so rare
you hear anybody doing that any longer
I know.
"I even bought myself a Surgery , you know,"
and I just love it.
I haven't learned everything to do on it yet
but I figure that will help me save you know.
Yeah.
"My, uh, roommate does sew some"
"and, and, uh, she hasn't sewed anything in a long time"
"but I, I'm sure that she could pick it up again."
My mother always sewed.
She tried to teach me when I was young but not interested
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Well, see, some people are, some aren't"
"because  I have some sisters, I have three sisters"
Yeah.
and none of those are really interested in sewing.
Yeah.
"But that's a real good way to save money, though by doing that."
"Yeah,"
"and then I can also, you know, do some crafts and sell those at garage sales."
"Uh-huh,"
"Yeah,"
do you?
"Yes,"
that is great.
"Yeah,"
it's fun.
"And then there's a new one that started out that I've caught a couple of times called GOOD AND EVIL, I think."
"Oh, I heard they just canceled that."
"Oh, really?"
I read in today's paper they just canceled that show.
It is a real different one.
"It's, uh, it's, it's different."
I guess I watch it more out of the uniqueness of it and the time that it comes on more than the fact that I have to see it.
"But,"
"Have you seen the show, it's, it's new this year, called HOME FRONT?"
"No,"
I haven't watched that.
"Oh, it's, it's really good."
"It's, uh, I think it's on like Tuesday nights from ten to eleven"
Uh-huh.
and it's set in post World War Two times
and it's about how the servicemen come home and readjust to civilian life here and the changes everyone's going through.
It's really interesting.
"Oh, yeah."
It's kind of like a a nighttime soap opera type thing.
Sounds neat.
"It is, it's a good, it's really well written."
Yeah.
"Is that on, what what station?"
"Uh, I don't even know, to tell you the truth"
"Oh, okay."
What other shows do you like?
It probably comes from where you are.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
that it probably does.
Most
"I, I'm not sure"
"but,"
"When I drive through that area, that's all I see is  pressure treated, pressure treated lumber yards."
Yeah.
"It's nothing but woods up here, down here."
Yeah.
"I don't, I haven't, I mean, I haven't,"
"I used to live in Dallas. In Arlington, actually."
"And, but that was just when I was a kid"
so I don't really know what the cost of living is even like in Dallas anymore.
"But it's, I don't know, we're a college town"
so that doesn't help us out any.
Right.
East Texas.
"We have,"
"gas is a dollar dollar twelve a gallon,"
so that's probably about what you're paying
Huh.
so.
"Yeah,"
"my current project is a walkway which I'm building around the house and out to the backyard to, uh, you know, digging it out and laying sand and putting, uh, pavers on top of that"
so.
Yeah.
That's a lot easier.
You've got something going all the time.
"Well, what do you think in terms of, uh, benefits?"
"Well, personally, you know, I think, you know,"
I like to watch those skins games.
Uh-huh.
"Do you ever watch those where they just play for a certain you know,"
for each hole they win they get the money for it.
Uh-huh.
I think those are pretty exciting.
"Well, I myself, really have not seen a whole lot of point to the game of golf."
"You hit a little ball,"
"you chase it,"
"you go find it,"
and then you hit it again and lose it again.
"Uh-huh,"
yeah.
"And I know the whole point is to get it in that little bitty hole,"
but seems to me like if they made the hole bigger it'd be easier.
Oh really
I sometimes wonder why men like it so much because they get so frustrated and mad at themselves when they don't do well.
"Oh, I know."
"Oh, yeah."
My husband and his buddies are not very good.
They play like maybe once a month or less
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"and so they all hit like in the low nineties,"
and they think they're having a really good game
"Oh, yeah."
So.
"Well, my husband's average ran in the mid seventies"
Wow.
so he wasn't bad.
"Yeah,"
that is good.
Quite a difference.
Yeah.
"What, uh, what kind of climate do you have?"
"Well, uh, it's, we just moved recently"
"so now we're in the, uh, Dallas area"
and it's very very nice
Oh.
"and,"
"The only experience I have,"
I don't have any children
"but I've, uh, I was a baby-sitter in high school."
"And then, just recently, after we were married, I baby-sat for a dentist while she worked."
"And I just, uh ..."
<talking> Yeah.
"That's the only thing I've ever done also, is baby-sit."
Is it? ery faint.
"But, uh, I've heard people that I work with talk about, you know, child care."
"Especially, I guess it's even harder on single mothers."
"Oh, yeah."
The expense.
Yeah.
"Having to pick up the kid by, you know, six o'clock"
or it's five dollars for every minute you're late. And stuff like that
Uh-huh.
Which is understandable.
"I mean, these people can't, you know, stay there till eight o'clock because somebody has to work late"
Just sit around
That that's true.
but
"See the lady I did it for,"
that's why she picked me is because I would go to her house so she wouldn't have to get her little girl up.
So she could sleep in.
"Uh, they, they don't get repealed as easily as they do."
"Like the guy in California got you know, twice before he went to the gas chamber"
"and then they said okay, no,"
you don't have to go.
And then they took him back.
"I mean, it just seems,  Yeah, it just seemed a little inconsistent."
"Jeez,"
that's a lot of repeals.
"And then you have like two,"
you have these people who are serial killers that didn't even get the death sentence back when ever you know.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
I don't know.
"I, I'm trying to think about other crimes that would warrant it."
"Uh, I guess,"
"what is it, what's the policy now with treason?"
"Do they, uh, do they axe you for treason or is it a life sentence?"
"No,"
"I don't, I don't think, uh, the military doesn't execute anymore"
so.
Yeah.
Or death before the firing squad or whatever.
Yeah.
"So, I think about the only one is, uh, rape,"
"Okay,"
I'm here.
How do you feel about public schools?
"Well, our public schools are, are really poor, I feel."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I'm not sure where Georgia ranks in the nation"
"but, uh, we're toward the bottom."
Yeah.
"but since it's just the two of us, it's"
"Yeah,"
yeah
Well that happens to us sometimes too.
Yeah.
"But, uh, sometimes if something, uh, is on that they want to watch I leave it on,"
but we eat in the kitchen
and their heads are always poking past the door.
"Uh-huh,"
to see what's happening.
Yeah.
"Anyway food is, is, uh, a real life-style kind of thing"
and some people don't like to do this
"but I like to uh, cook with my kids."
"Oh, uh-huh."
"And if they're going to have other kids over then, then they help."
"And we make real simple things, you know, those, oh,"
"I I don't know if you've ever made them, maybe not since you don't have kids yet, but those Jell-O, uh, gelatin things you can pick up with your fingers, I can't think of what they call it."
"Oh, I've seen those in the magazines."
"Yeah,"
they're so simple.
Uh-huh.
And the kids love to do that.
"Uh, finger food is, is a biggie with them."
Yeah.
"And, and like, now one thing I wish I could find a, a better way to do are celery sticks and carrot sticks, because they love to do that"
and it's just really hard
"and if you have to work with a knife, I don't like that."
Yeah.
"So, that's, uh,"
"they like to eat it,"
"but it's a hard one to have to, to prepare."

The Jain year starts with Pratipada following Diwali. Jain calendar is known as Vira Nirvana Samvat and their year 2501 started with Diwali of year 1974. The Jain business people traditionally start their accounting year from Diwali. The relationship between the Vir and Shaka era is given in Titthogali Painnaya and Dhavalaa by Acharya Virasena:<br>
पंच य मासा पंच य वास छच्चेव होन्ति वाससया|<br>
परिणिव्वुअस्स अरिहितो तो उप्पन्नो सगो राया||
Thus the Nirvana occurred 605 years and 5 months before the Saka era.
"On Diwali morning, Nirvan Ladoo is offered after praying to Lord Mahavira in all Jain temples across the world. The most important principle of Jains is Ahinsa or non violence, thus they tend to avoid firecrackers during Diwali as they cause harm to living organisms. Diwali is celebrated in atmosphere of austerity, simplicity, serenity, equity, calmness, charity, philanthropy and environment-consciousness. Jain temples, homes, offices, shops are decorated with lights and diyas. Relatives distribute sweets to each other. The lights are symbolic of knowledge or removal of ignorance. Swetambar jains observe two days of fasting in remembrance of the penance and sacrifice of Mahavira. In temples and homes, devotees sing and chant hymns and mantras from Jain religious texts in praise of the Tirthankar and congregate for a prayer and recite verses from the Uttaradhyayan Sutra which contain the last teachings of Mahavira. Jains pay visit to Pawapuri,Nalanda in Bihar on this special day to offer their prayers. The Jain year starts with Pratipada, next day of Diwali."

It is a compact settlement above the left bank of the Ljubljanica River between Zgornji Kašelj and Zalog. It was part of the traditional region of Upper Carniola and is now included with the rest of the municipality in the Central Slovenia Statistical Region."
"Kašelj Hill () rises east of the settlement, across the Ljubljanica River. Below the hill to the north, Spodnji Kašel extends to the Cold Valley (), so called because the winter snow lies there late into the spring. The soil in Spodnji Kašel is sandy and there are fields to the west."
"Spodnji Kašelj was mentioned in written sources together with neighboring Zgornji Kašelj in 1360 as ""Niederchaeschel"" and ""Kaeschel"" (and as ""Geschel"" in 1421, ""(Ober) Kassel"" in 1436, and ""Kaschell"" in 1496). The name is derived from German ""Kassel"" and it is likely that the German name is derived from Latin ""castellum"" 'castle', referring to one or both castles on Kašelj Hill east of the settlement. However, it is also possible that the name is derived from Latin ""casale"" 'peasant house, peasant settlement'. In the past the German name was ""Unterkaschel""."
"On the western slope of Kašelj Hill there is an abandoned quarry. Tradition states that the last French soldier from the short-lived Illyrian Provinces was executed there.

= = = Thomas Rede = = =
"Thomas Rede (c. 1390– c. 1455) was a merchant, landholder, knight and public official of Roche Castle near Laugharne, Carmarthenshire."
"He was the son of William Rede and Jonet Wirriot. His father was born about 1370, the bastard son of Thomas Rede, a wealthy merchant of Carmarthen and Bristol. His mother was the daughter of Sir Wilcock Wirriot of Orielton in Pembrokeshire."
"Thomas was closely associated with Gruffudd ap Nicholas, a powerful figure in South Wales in the mid-15th century, as well as being Thomas’ father-in-law. In 1446 Thomas and Gruffudd farmed part of Cockmill in Carmarthen, and in 1449 they were involved together in a lease of the town. While not nearly as prominent in politics as his father-in-law, father or grandfather, Thomas did serve as beadle in Widigada from 1451 to 1452, and he was apparently knighted."
"Thomas married as his second wife Margred Dwnn, the cousin of his first wife, and daughter of another prominent Carmarthenshire family. By these two wives, and others, he had at least nine children."
"Thomas Rede, knight, was buried in Grey Friars church in Carmarthen, along with his father-in-law Gruffudd ap Nicholas and other members of the family. Thomas’ tomb lay on the south side of the choir. His coat of arms is described as: “Thomas Rede of Ye Roche -- quarterly, argent 3 pipes (elsewhere reeds) in fess, banded azure; and on a chief azure a lion passant sable.” The quartered coat of arms is for Wirriot, his mother’s family."
"Thomas’ principal estate was The Roche, near Talacharn (Laugharne) in Carmarthenshire, which appears on maps today as the ruin of Roche Castle. Later heralds in England rendered it “Rodes Court,” undoubtedly due to the confusion of the distance of time and place."
"The Roche was originally known as Machrells Walles, built in the 13th century by John de la Roche. Over the course of the ensuing century the property passed from one family member to another until in 1392 it came into the possession of David Fleming, who immediately granted it to Sir Thomas Fleming, knight and other Irish land owners. Subsequently, according to a successful 16th-century petition of James Reede, gentleman of London it became the property of Gruffudd Nicholas (Gruffudd ap Nicholas) and Thomas Nicholas, who granted it to William Rede and Jonet Wirriot as part of their marriage settlement."
"Decades later, in 1439, perhaps at the death of William who would have been 69 years old, Richard Rede conveyed the property to Thomas Nicoll (Thomas ap Gruffudd ap Nicholas?), “as of the gift of William Rede brother of the said Richard”. A conveyance by fine implies an agreed exchange, so it may have been by previous agreement that Thomas Nicoll conveyed Machrells Walles to William’s son, Richard. In 1452 Richard Rede, esquire and his wife Maud transferred Machrells Walles and other properties by quitclaim to Richard’s brother, Thomas Rede, esquire. The Roche remained in the family for an additional 120 years until James Rede sold it to Sir John Perrot in 1572."
"The coat of arms for Rede of Roche is a pun on the name. It always contains three reeds (golden or silver) on a sable field, and sometimes carries the pun further by adding three roaches (a type of fish) on a red field. The red field might even be considered a pun of the name Rede - one Welsh homonym for Rede being “rhudd,” which means red."

Claes Corneliszoon Moeyaert or Nicolaes Moyaert or Mooyaert (1592–1655) was an authoritative Catholic Dutch painter. He followed Rembrandt in his use of red chalk.
Moeyart was born in Durgerdam. As a young man he is thought to have traveled to Italy to see and experience its art. At 25 he married Grietje Claes (in 1617). Possibly he was in business with Pieter Lastman in St. Antoniesbreestraat.
"Moeyaert painted many biblical and mythological scenes, and also designed Amsterdam's triumphal arch for the arrival of Maria de Medici. On 1 September 1638, he stood on the Spaarndammerdijk to watch the procession."
"Moeyaert was a very rich man and had three children, two mentally retarded and cared for in his own home. He had stakes in the business of Hendrick van Uylenburgh, a famous art dealer, related to Rembrandt's wife, Saskia van Uylenburgh."
"Moeyaert was for many years' commissioner of the Theatre of Van Campen, with Jan Vos. He lived until his death at a house on the Singel, not far from Torensluis. Nicolaes Berchem, Salomon Koninck, Jacob van der Does and Jan Baptist Weenix were his pupils."

He was a key contributor on the first Vanderbilt baseball team to make it to the College World Series. In 2012, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Cotuit Kettleers of the Cape Cod Baseball League. He was named an All-American and the SEC Baseball Player of the Year in 2013."
"The Astros selected Kemp in the fifth round of the 2013 MLB draft. In 2015, Kemp began the season with the Corpus Christi Hooks of the Class AA Texas League. He received a midseason promotion to the Fresno Grizzlies of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League, and appeared in the 2015 All-Star Futures Game."
"Kemp began the 2016 season with Fresno, and was promoted to the major leagues on May 16. He was optioned to Fresno on June 25, 2016, when A. J. Reed was called up for his debut. On August 7, 2016, Kemp was recalled to the Astros. After former Astros center fielder Carlos Gómez was designated for assignment, it was said that Kemp and Jake Marisnick would be splitting duties in centerfield."
"On March 19, 2017, he was optioned back to Fresno. On April 27, 2017 the Astros promoted Kemp to the major leagues to replace injured Teoscar Hernández. On May 1, 2017, the Astros optioned him back down as Marisnick was activated off of the disabled list."
"On September 2, 2017, he was called up to the Astros and played in their doubleheader against the Mets, their first home game after Hurricane Harvey. In 17 games with the Astros, Kemp had a .216 average and 4 RBI. The Astros finished the season with a 101-61 record and eventually won the 2017 World Series, their first ever championship title. Kemp did not participate in any playoff action, but was still on the 40-man roster at the time, and won his first championship title."
"In March 2018, the Astros optioned Kemp back to Fresno. He was called up on May 16 to replace Jake Marisnick. In the 2018 season, Kemp played in 97 games for the Astros, batting .263/.351/.392 with 6 HR and 30 RBI, playing primarily in left field. He was mocked by the Fenway Park crowd and organist during the second game of the 2018 American League Championship Series (ALCS) when he took an extended period of time to return to the batter's box after a foul ball. Following the third game of the 2018 ALCS, Kemp received wide sports media coverage for making a leaping catch against the left field wall on a ball hit by Steve Pearce. The Red Sox challenged the catch at the wall, since it sounded like the ball hit the wall first. After further review, they announced the catch as confirmed, meaning the MLB replay crew in New York saw conclusive evidence of the catch.

The Easter Island butterflyfish is native to the waters around Easter Island and is found nowhere else. Its preferred habitat is on reefs and among volcanic boulders heavily clad in brown algae at depths down to about . Juvenile fish are sometimes found among corals in rock pools.
"Juvenile Easter Island butterflyfish have been observed to act as cleaner fish, picking parasites off the skin of larger fish. During the breeding season, male and female adult fish form pair bonds."
"The Easter Island butterflyfish is a bottom feeding fish. Examination of its stomach contents have shown that it feeds on polycheaete worms, shrimps, fish eggs and barnacles, and fragments of the black sponge ""Amphimedon"" sp. were also found. This was unexpected as butterfly fish are not known to feed on sponges, however the explanation may be that the sponge was ingested in error when the fish was feeding on the barnacles which had become entangled in the sponge."
"At one time this fish was listed as ""Vulnerable"" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in their Red List of Threatened Species but in 2010, this was changed to being of ""Least Concern"". The reason given for this change was that, although its range was very limited, this fish was quite common within that range and did not face any significant threats. A small number of fish were collected for the reef aquarium trade but the number was not believed to reduce the population to any great extent."

"Edward Rigby (1747–1821) was an English physician, writer, and local politician."
"The son of John Rigby, by his wife Sarah (d. 1773), daughter of John Taylor, he was born at Chowbent, Lancashire, on 27 December 1747."
"One of his sisters married Dr. Caleb Hillier Parry, and became the mother of Sir William Edward Parry."
"Educated at Norwich School and Warrington Academy, Rigby was apprenticed in 1762 to David Martineau, surgeon, of Norwich, and then studied in London. Admitted a member of the Corporation of Surgeons on 4 May 1769, he married in the same year, and settled in Norwich."
"In 1786 Rigby took the lead in establishing the Norfolk Benevolent Society for the relief of the widows and orphans of medical men. In July 1789 he visited France and other parts of the continent, witnessing the storming of the Bastille. A practical agriculturist, he was the friend of Thomas William Coke of Holkham, he experimented on his own farm at Framingham Earl, about five miles from Norwich."
"In 1783 Rigby became a member of the corporation of guardians of Norwich, and promoted the economical administration of the Poor Laws. Meeting with much opposition, he resigned in the following year. He became alderman in 1802 in a very tight contest for the North Ward, sheriff in 1803, and mayor of Norwich in 1805, presiding over a meeting addressing the issue of smallpox in the city. Rigby is said to have made known the flying shuttle to Norwich manufacturers, and to have introduced vaccination."
"In politics Rigby was a Whig, and a supporter of William Windham. In 1794, however, when Windham became Secretary at War and had to stand again for Norwich, Rigby was one of the disillusioned Whigs who backed James Mingay against him, and proposed the candidate. Windham was elected, but Mingay's reputation as a Whig was boosted."
"Rigby died on 27 October 1821, and was buried at Framingham."

It is also the archaeological site of an ancient Minoan settlement in central Crete. The discovery of ancient roads leading from Archanes to Juktas, Anemospilia, Xeri Kara and Vathypetro indicate that Archanes was an important hub in the region during Minoan times. Archaeological evidence indicates that ancient Archanes spread out over the same area as the modern town of Archanes."
"In 1912, Xanthoudides noted the importance of Archanes, but Sir Arthur Evans was the first to characterize the site as palatial, declaring that Archanes was likely a Summer Palace for the Knossos kings. Spyridon Marinatos and N. Platon excavated minor areas in the region, but nothing supported Evans' theory. In 1964, Yannis Sakellarakis dug trial trenches at the Tourkoyeitonia site and uncovered the first evidence of a palace site. Since 1966, Archanes has been excavated by the Greek Archaeological Society under the supervision of John Sakellarakis and Efi Sapouna-Sakellarakis."
"In the Minoan era, aqueducts delivered water to Kephala Hill from spring water sources at Archanes, which are also the source of the Kairatos River."
"Troullos is the easternmost site of the Archanes settlement. Tourkoyeitonia, in central Archanes, is the site of its palace, likely built in the Middle Minoan period. Excavations began here in 1964 by J. Sakellarakis. It contains features such as ashlar blocks, poros-stone plaques and blocks, plaster, wood, stucco floor tiles, gypsum, kouskoura slabs, mud bricks, ironstone blocks, schist plaques, blue marble flooring, incurved concave altars, wooden columns and pillars, frescoes and Polytheron doorways. A variety of Porphyrite stone lamps, vases, amphorae, cooking pots, cups, lamps, tools and every-day domestic items such as tweezers have been unearthed at the site. Southwest of Tourkoyeitonia, more of the palace is found. While little remains of the architecture, the walls that are preserved are Middle Minoan III–Late Minoan IA. Linear A tablets and the model of a house were excavated at The Archive along with MMIII-LMIA pottery and several unworked pieces of rock crystal, obsidian and steatite."
"The man-made enclosure of a spring, partially excavated in 1921 by Sir Arthur Evans, was completed by J. Sakellarakis in 1964. The floor is laid with pebbles, and the walls are poros-stone.

"Valu Jada Tolu Beltu () is a 1992 Indian Telugu comedy film, produced by Gutta Madhusudana Rao under the banner M.R.C. Movie Creations and directed by Vijaya Bapineedu. It stars Rajendra Prasad and Kanaka, with music composed by Prasanna Swaraj."
"The film begins at a village Accha Rao (Rajendra Prasad) an innocent craven leads a rejoicing life. He acquires a constable job, proceeds to take charge where the Station S.I. (Vallabhaneni Janardhan) is malicious. Here, their Head Constable (P. L. Narayana) endears Accha Rao's amiable nature, gives him shelter and his daughter Seeta (Kanaka) loves Accha Rao. Meanwhile, a new scheme commences in the town by a company to sell household goods at the lowest prices. The company agent Peter (Sai Kumar) collects huge amounts as advance from the public. Thereupon, the Company turns fraudulent and the Proprietor's son tries to escape with the money when Peter restricts his way. In that quarrel, accidentally, he dies in the hands of Peter when S.I. takes him into custody and tortures terribly. Just as, Accha Rao shows his solace which Peter exploits and absconds. So to protect Accha Rao, Head Constable takes the guilt. Right now, to redeem himself, Accha Rao moves to nab Peter along with Seeta. At present, the district S.P. (Kota Shankar Rao) instructs S.I. to present Accha Rao & Peter before him. Parallelly, the Company Proprietor (M. S. Gopinath) bids the S.I. to slay them out. In that process, Accha Rao meets his mother (Radha Kumari) and learns that Peter's wife (Sailaja) is terminally ill. Be concerned, Accha Rao looks after them, even finds whereabouts of Peter and unites him with his wife. Thereafter, Peter surrenders himself to Police. Simultaneously, Accha Rao goes into the clutches of the Company Proprietor. Both of them try to slaughter Accha Rao & Peter, but Accha Rao breaks out by eliminating the blackguard and rushes towards Peter. By that time, S.I. encounters Peter and tries to kill Accha Rao too. Fortuitously, the S.P. witnesses it and knocks out the S.I. Finally, Accha Rao is promoted as S.I. and the movie ends on a happy note with the marriage of Accha Rao & Seeta."

= = = Printer's sample stamp = = =
"A printer's sample stamp is a label produced by a printer resembling a stamp, but with no postal or other validity. Often it will include the name of the printer and demonstrate their printing capabilities. The stamps are not intended for use and are therefore to be distinguished from test stamps, though both test stamps and printer's sample stamps are dummy stamps in the broadest sense of that term."
"The R.M. Phillips Collection at the British Postal Museum and Archive contains a number of sample stamps produced by De La Rue before 1900, bearing their name and demonstrating their printing abilities for the British Post Office."
"Waterlow & Sons produced many small sheetlets of sample stamps in the same design as genuine stamps produced for their customers, but with the colours changed and overprinted diagonally ""Waterlow & Sons Ltd. Specimen"". The stamps in these sheetlets were also punched with a small hole in the corner to prevent their postal or revenue use and the sheetlets were displayed at the 1910 Brussels Exhibition. Clive Akerman comments in ""The Presentation of Revenue Stamps: Taxes and Duties in South America"", that the stamps were produced from obsolete dies."
"The ""Prince Consort Essay"" was a printer's sample stamp created in 1851 as an example of the surface printed stamps that Henry Archer proposed to print and perforate under contract with the British government at a lower price than the current printing firm of Perkins Bacon. The Prince Consort stamps were provided by the artist Robert Edward Branston, from an engraving executed by Samuel William Reynolds."
"Although commonly known as an essay, the stamp was not really an essay as it was never intended that a postage stamp be produced based on the design, nor was it an un-adopted design. It is more accurately described as a printer's sample stamp."
"The concept has been used worldwide with modern sample stamps from printers in Switzerland and the Netherlands, amongst other countries, commonly seen in philatelic circles."

"Dr. Shrinker was a segment during the first season of the ABC network's ""The Krofft Supershow"" in 1976."
"Dr. Shrinker (Jay Robinson) is a mad scientist who creates a shrink ray that can miniaturise anything. Three young adults — Brad Fulton (Ted Eccles), B.J. Masterson (Susan Lawrence) and her brother Gordie Masterson (Jeff MacKay) — crash land their airplane on an island. As they make their way to the only house on the island, they meet Dr. Shrinker and his assistant, Hugo (Billy Barty). Dr. Shrinker, in an effort to prove that his shrinking ray works, shrinks the three people down to tall. The remainder of the series was different efforts by the 'Shrinkies' to return to normal size, while Dr. Shrinker and Hugo want to catch the trio so that they will have physical proof that the ray works for whatever world power wants to buy it. Dr. Shrinker also implied that he would give the unnamed buyer the Shrinkies as a free bonus. However, in one episode, Dr. Shrinker's plan was to sell the shrink ray to the highest bidder, and the second highest bidder would receive the Shrinkies."
"Each episode was basically the same. As Dr. Shrinker himself said in one episode...""I chase the Shrinkies. I catch the Shrinkies. The Shrinkies escape. It's a vicious cycle, and it's driving me mad!"""
"The concept was very likely inspired by the 1940 film ""Dr. Cyclops"" in which a scientist working in the South American jungle uses his radiation experiments to shrink a group of fellow scientists to prevent them from discovering his secret work."

"In the UK, a Pupil Referral Unit (PRU) (previously known as Pupil Re-integration Unit by some Local Education Authorities) is an alternative education provision which is specifically organised to provide education for children who aren't able to attend school and may not otherwise receive suitable education. This could be because they have a short- or long-term illness, have been excluded, or are a new starter waiting for a mainstream school place."
Each LEA has a duty under section 19 of the Education Act 1996 to provide suitable education for children of compulsory school age who cannot attend school. Placing pupils in PRUs is just one of the ways in which local authorities can ensure that they can comply with this duty. PRUs are a mixture of public units and privately managed companies.
"There are currently over 421 PRUs in England. Between 2002 and 2003, 17,523 pupils attended PRUs at some point. Although PRUs do not have to provide a full National Curriculum, they should offer a basic curriculum which includes English, mathematics, the sciences, PSHE and ICT."
"A PRU is treated the same as any other type of school, subject to the same inspections from Ofsted. Since September 2010, some PRUs are referred to as ""Short Stay Schools"", although the government still broadly refer to them as PRUs or Alternative Provision (APs)."

"The family spent their summers in Scotland, the setting of her books. They were there in 1939 when her father, a naval officer, decided that they should remain in Inverewe for the duration of World War II. The area was remote; FitzRoy wrote her first book, ""Orders to Poach"" (which told the story of the Stewart children receiving unusual instructions from their overseas father) to entertain her two younger sisters, Barbara (now Ormrod) and the late Amelia (now Jessel). It was published by Collins, as Billy Collins was a friend of the family. The second, ""Steer by the Stars"" and the third ""The House in the Hills"", were based in the same location."

= = = Reflective subcategory = = =
"In mathematics, a full subcategory ""A"" of a category ""B"" is said to be reflective in ""B"" when the inclusion functor from ""A"" to ""B"" has a left adjoint. This adjoint is sometimes called a ""reflector"", or ""localization"". Dually, ""A"" is said to be coreflective in ""B"" when the inclusion functor has a right adjoint."
"Informally, a reflector acts as a kind of completion operation. It adds in any ""missing"" pieces of the structure in such a way that reflecting it again has no further effect."
"A full subcategory A of a category B is said to be reflective in B if for each B-object ""B"" there exists an A-object formula_1 and a B-morphism formula_2 such that for each B-morphism formula_3 to an A-object formula_4 there exists a unique A-morphism formula_5 with formula_6."
"The pair formula_7 is called the A-reflection of ""B"". The morphism formula_8 is called the A-reflection arrow. (Although often, for the sake of brevity, we speak about formula_1 only as being the A-reflection of ""B"")."
This is equivalent to saying that the embedding functor formula_10 is a right adjoint. The left adjoint functor formula_11 is called the reflector. The map formula_8 is the unit of this adjunction.
The reflector assigns to formula_13 the A-object formula_1 and formula_15 for a B-morphism formula_16 is determined by
the commuting diagram
"If all A-reflection arrows are (extremal) epimorphisms, then the subcategory A is said to be (extremal) epireflective. Similarly, it is bireflective if all reflection arrows are bimorphisms."
"All these notions are special case of the common generalization—formula_17-reflective subcategory, where formula_17 is a class of morphisms."
"The formula_17-reflective hull of a class A of objects is defined as the smallest formula_17-reflective subcategory containing A. Thus we can speak about reflective hull, epireflective hull, extremal epireflective hull, etc."
An anti-reflective subcategory is a full subcategory A such that the only objects of B that have an A-reflection arrow are those that are already in A.
"Dual notions to the above-mentioned notions are coreflection, coreflection arrow, (mono)coreflective subcategory, coreflective hull, anti-coreflective subcategory."

"Cosmos atrosanguineus, the chocolate cosmos, is a species of ""Cosmos"", native to Mexico. It has often been claimed that it is extinct in the wild; however it is ""quite abundant"" in Mexico. The species was introduced into cultivation in 1885, when the British seed company Thompson & Morgan first listed it in their seed catalogue. Its dark red to brownish red flowers have a scent resembling chocolate, which is one reason for its popularity as a cultivated plant."
"""Cosmos atrosanguineus"" is a herbaceous perennial plant growing to 40–60 cm tall, with a fleshy tuberous root. The leaves are 7–15 cm long, pinnate, with leaflets 2–5 cm long. The flowers are produced in a capitulum 3-4.5 cm diameter, dark red to maroon-dark brown, with a ring of six to ten (usually eight) broad ray florets and a center of disc florets; they have a light vanillin fragrance (like many chocolates), which becomes more noticeable towards the end of the day."
"The species was first described in 1861 by William Hooker, as ""Cosmos diversifolia"" var. ""atrosanguineus"". Eduard Ortgies later elevated it to a full species, placing it in the genus ""Bidens"". Andreas Voss transferred it back to ""Cosmos"", retaining its status as an independent species. It is one of eight species of ""Cosmos"" placed in section ""Discopoda"". ""Cosmos"" belongs to subtribe Coreopsidinae."
"In 2008, Oku, T.; Takahashi, H.; Yagi, F.; et al. analyzed the Chocolate Cosmos flower using PSID (plastid subtype identity) sequences in order to clarify the phylogenetic relationships of this plant.

"Cerezyme is a freeze-dried medicine containing imiglucerase, manufactured by Genzyme Corporation. It is given intravenously after reconstitution as a treatment for Type 1 and Type 3 Gaucher's disease. It is available in formulations containing 200 or 400 units per vial. The specific activity of highly purified human enzyme is 890,000 units/mg. A typical dose is 2.5U/kg every two weeks, up to a maximum of 60 U/kg once every two weeks, and safety has been established from ages 2 and up. It is one of more expensive medications, with an annual cost of $200,000 per person in the United States. Imiglucerase has been granted orphan drug status in the United States, Australia, and Japan."
"Cerezyme was one of the drugs manufactured at Genzyme's Allston, Massachusetts plant, for which production was disrupted in 2009 after contamination with Vesivirus 2117."
"The most common side effect is hypersensitivity, which occurs in about 3% of patients. It is associated with symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, rashes, itching, and angiooedema. Less common side effects include dizziness, headache, nausea, diarrhoea, and reactions at the injection site; they are found in less than 1% of patients."

"Carlo Lurago (also spelled Luraghi) (1615 – 22 October 1684) was an Italian architect, who was most active in Prague."
"He was born in Pellio Superiore in the Val d'Intelvi, near Como. At the age of 23, as an already an accomplished plasterer, he moved to Prague. He would build several different Jesuit churches and cloisters there, including some at the Clementinum, in the early baroque style. His first commission was the stucco decoration on the gothic St. Saviour Church in Prague. He also worked on the Saint Eligius Chapel there in 1654, before his work was redone by Domenico Orsi."
"Lurago was also successful outside of Bohemia. He developed the plans for the Passau Cathedral. It is notable because the main altar has a series of flat elliptical domes. This arch design foreshadows many other buildings of the baroque style. Another notable example of his work is the pilgrimage church of Maria Taferl, which had to be completed by Jakob Prandtauer after Lurago died in Passau."

"Paul Williams (born July 27, 1981) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 2000 to 2012. He held the WBO welterweight title twice between 2007 and 2008, the WBO interim junior middleweight title in 2008, and challenged once for the unified middleweight title in 2010. Nicknamed ""The Punisher"", and standing at a height of 6 feet 1 inches, Williams was unusually tall for the three divisions in which he competed. His career was cut short in 2012 after a motorcycle accident left him paralyzed from the waist down."
"His debut was in the year 2000. He is promoted by the Goossens. In 2005 he outpointed former Olympic bronze medalist Terrence Cauthen and, later that year, he knocked out Alfonso Sanchez in 5 rounds."
"During World War II, the plant was fully occupied building 0-4-0 and 0-6-0 saddle tanks for industrial use, although they did manufacture four PC class 4-6-2s for the Iraqi State Railways in 1940 (one of which was lost at sea ""en route""). In 1943, ninety Austerity 0-6-0ST locomotives were built for the War Department."
"In 1944, the Vulcan Foundry, which had been formed by Robert Stephenson and Charles Tayleur in 1830, acquired a substantial stock holding, and they became part of the English Electric Company. The bulk of the output was for export or industrial use, including fifty South African Class 19D 4-8-2s, Indian YB, YL and WM classes, and ten M class 4-6-2s for the Tasmanian Government Railways. Domestic mainline locomotives included thirty five Class L1 2-6-4T for the Eastern Region of British Railways and 100 9400 class 0-6-0 pannier tanks for the Western Region."
"The last steam locomotives to be built were a conventional 0-6-0T in 1958 and a six-coupled fireless locomotive in 1959. The Forth Street works were closed in 1960 and the Darlington Works, continuing with diesel and electric locomotives became ""English Electric Company Darlington Works"" in 1962."
"The office block and one workshop of Stephenson's Forth Street Works in South St Newcastle upon Tyne have been restored by The Robert Stephenson Trust. The Trust lost its lease to these buildings in February 2009 following purchase of the whole Robert Stephenson & Co and Hawthorn Leslie locomotive works sites for redevelopment as the ""Stephenson Quarter"". The restored block and several other buildings are protected by Listed Building status but future public access is uncertain."
"Commencing in 2013 the site of both the Robert Stephenson and the Hawthorn works started to be redeveloped as the Stephenson Quarter. The landlord fronting this operation was initially Silverlink Developers. As part of their commitment to the area's heritage they have been hosting a once monthly opening of the South Street buildings housing a music, food and drink festival branded as the Boiler Shop Steamer."
"Councillor Nick Forbes, leader of Newcastle City Council, visited the development on 8 April 2014 to give the city's seal of approval to the project. In the same month the developers Silverlink morphed into the Clouston Group."

"Alim-ud-Din (Urdu: علیم الدین‎; 15 December 1930 – 12 July 2012) was a Pakistani cricketer who played 25 Tests for Pakistan between 1954 and 1962. His name is sometimes rendered Alimuddin. A fast-scoring, right-handed opening batsman and occasional right-arm leg break bowler, he was the youngest player ever to appear in first-class cricket, aged 12 years and 73 days. In international cricket, he scored 1,091 runs at the average of 25.37, including two centuries and seven fifties. In 1954, he was a member of the Pakistani squad which toured England and recorded Pakistan's first Test match win. Former Pakistani captain Mushtaq Mohammad said about him that he was ""a thorough gentleman as well as a great cricketer for Pakistan""."
"During his career Alim-ud-Din played 140 first-class matches and scored 7,275 runs, with the average of 32.77, including 14 centuries and 38 fifties; he also took 40 wickets. Critics considered him to be an excellent fielder. He made his debut for Rajasthan aged only 12 years 73 days, becoming the youngest player to have played first-class cricket. In 1942–43, he played his maiden match in the Ranji Trophy, scoring 13 and 27 runs in his two innings. His highest score in first-class cricket was 142, against Worcestershire in 1954. Domestically, Alim-ud-Din represented Sindh, Rajasthan, Karachi, Bahawalpur and Gujarat, and became the first Pakistani batsman to face a ball bowled by an international bowler on Pakistani soil, in a match between the Sindh and West Indians in 1948. During Pakistan's 1954 tour of England, Alim-ud-Din scored more than 700 runs, including two centuries in the first two matches. He was most successful during 1961–62, scoring 1,020 runs in 12 matches at an average of 51.00. In the same season he captained Karachi, leading the team to victories in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy and Ayub Zonal Trophy. His final season in first-class cricket was 1967–68."
"Alim-ud-Din played 25 Test matches for Pakistan during his career and scored 1,091 runs in international cricket at the average of 25.37. He made two centuries and seven fifties. Cricket critics believed that he possessed a sound technique. In Test matches, Alim-ud-Din established an effective opening partnership with Hanif Mohammad."
"Alim-ud-Din started his international career against England in June 1954, at the Lord's Cricket Ground, in a match in which he scored 19 runs. In the fourth Test of the same series Pakistan beat England by 24 runs, recording their first Test win over them to become the first team to defeat England during their maiden tour. Alim-ud-Din managed to score 10 runs in the match. In 1954–55, he played, against India, in Pakistan's first home Tests, finishing the series as the leading run scorer with 332; he made three fifties and in the fifth match scored 103 not out at the National Stadium, Karachi, his first international century. He was the first batsman ever to make an international century on the Ground."
"Alim-ud-Din also toured West Indies as a part of Pakistan cricket team in 1957–58. He was not successful in the series and his highest score remained 41 runs which he made in the fourth Test at the Bourda, Georgetown, Guyana. In 1962, under the captaincy of Javed Burki, Pakistan visited England where they played a five Test match series. In the fifth Test at Headingley, a low scoring match for Pakistan, Alim-ud-Din's scores of 50 and 60 made him the team's highest scorer of the match. In the fifth Test of the home series against England in 1962, he scored his career best 109 runs at the National Stadium. He played his last match against England in Trent Bridge, Nottingham in 1962."
Former West Indian all-rounder Collie Smith was his only wicket in international cricket.
"He is variously known as ""Alim-ud-Din"" and ""Alimuddin"", with ""Wisden"" using the former in earlier editions and the latter in his obituary."
"Alim-ud-Din was born in Ajmer, a city in British India, on 15 December 1930. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, he moved to Karachi along with his family. He lived in London and never married, instead providing for his family. Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) had given him an opportunity to work at London Heathrow Airport. Two of his brothers, Salimuddin and Azimuddin, both also played first-class cricket. His nephew, James Uddin, the son of Salimuddin, is also a cricketer and currently plays semi-professional cricket in England."
"In later life, his pension was suspended after doubts over his actual birth date. The pension was restored after intervention from the Pakistani President."
"On 12 July 2012, Alim-ud-Din died in Northwick Park Hospital, Harrow, London. He suffered from heart and lung diseases. He also had kidney failure and was on dialysis. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) released a press statement expressing sorrow and conveying condolences to Alim-ud-Din's family."

"MG Srinivas (Bangalore) is an Indian film actor, director and screenwriter in Kannada cinema."
"His second short film Simply Kailawesome won the Platinum Remi Award during the 44th Houston Film Festival in 2011. This led to his first feature film in Kannada language, Topiwala, with Upendra in the lead."
"He was educated at Bangalore's Presidency School. After completing his graduation and acquiring his BSc degree from Seshadripuram College he commenced his career as a dance choreographer and successfully completed couple of stage performances. Later in 2007, he joined RedFM as a professional Radio jockey. During this period, he was in charge of a popular prime time show titled 'Blade Raja' which was aired in the morning. The show was a Super-hit and he hosted it for three consecutive years before moving to the film industry."
"Waving goodbye to his profession as a Radio jockey, MGS moved on to make short films so as to realize his dream of becoming a film director. His first movie, ""Rules"", grabbed attention for its slapstick comedy inter-twined with satirical tone on speed breakers. The short film was officially screened in the Australian Film Festival Bollywood and Beyond. He also acted in a small role in 2010 Kannada movie ""Just Maath Maathalli"" as Ramya's music freak brother."
"The stint continued with MGS who commenced his education at Abhinaya Tharanga to learn the nuances of acting. During this period, he was inspired by the stage play Typical Arathi by AS Murthy. The inspiration evolved into reality when he made the short film ""Simply Kailawesome"" which was strongly based on TP Kailasm. Simply Kailawesome's win of the Platinum Remi Award paved way for a formal introduction with Kannada superstar Upendra."
"The project 'Topiwala' was directed by MG Srinivas and released in Karnataka, to positive critical response. He continues to be the youngest director to have directed the Sandalwood superstar in his first stint as a director."
"MG Srinivas next directed a romantic comedy entertainer, Srinivasa Kalyana, produced by Bharat Jain under Mars Films. Music for the movie was scored by Midhun Mukundhan and Raghu Thane. This movie also saw MG Srinivas making his debut as a lead actor for the first time alongside Kavitha, Nikhila Rao while Achyuth Kumar, Sujay Shastry and Dattanna were seen in important roles."
Srinivasa Kalyana opened to positive reviews across the state. Deccan Chronicle gave the movie 3/5 and praised the movie for its light hearted comedy and youthful charm which showed philosophy in such simple manner. Times of India rated 3.5/5 and praised the sass touch to this candyfloss romance. IndiaGlitz gave a rating of 4/5 calling the movie a jovial journey and praised MG Srinivas for his commendable debut.
The movie was released and sustained for two weeks in USA and Australia(Melbourne and Sydney) after a critical and commercial success in India.
"MG Srinivas is currently working on his next venture, a crime thriller titled Birbal Trilogy. It is a series of 3 films and is said to be the first of its kind in the Kannada Film Industry. The first part is, Case No.1 : Finding Vajramuni followed by Case No.2 : Avrn bitt, Ivrn bitt, Ivryaru? and the last one is Case No.3 : Turremane."
"He is currently shooting for the first film, Birbal Trilogy - Case No. 1 : Finding Vajramuni, which stars himself in the lead and Rukmini Vasanth, Sujay Shastry, Suresh Heblikar, Madhusudhan Rao are seen in prominent roles and released in 18 January 2019."
"Rob McElhenney revealed at the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con that he had written an episode for this season involving the gang becoming contestants on the game show ""Family Feud."" While ""Family Feud"" producers were receptive to the storyline, FX refused to allow the episode to proceed to production."
"The season premiered on September 4, 2013, and contains 10 episodes. The series' landmark 100th episode aired on October 9."
"The first episode of the season premiered with the lowest number of U.S. viewers since it has been tracked for the show. This was primarily due to the new channel, FXX, being unavailable from many television providers. Many Suddenlink Communications franchises, although carrying the channel, have required the subscriber to buy a ""Sports Package"" in order to receive the network. Nonetheless, FX Network president John Landgraf said that ""the numbers last night [...] far exceeded our highest expectations"" and that ""To have just launched the channel three days ago and get these ratings is thrilling."""

= = = Lev Aronson = = =
"Lev Zacharovitch Aronson (Lew Aronson, Lev Aronoff, Lev Aronov, Lev Arnoff, Lew Arnow, Lew Arnoff-Aramon, Lew Arnoff-Aronson) (February 7, 1912 – November 12, 1988) was an Eastern European-American cellist and cello teacher."
"Lev Aronson was born February 7, 1912, in Mönchengladbach, Germany. Aronson's parents, Zorach and Pessa, along with their first infant son, had moved to Germany in 1911 so Zorach could study tailoring at the Fachhoschule (School of Fashion) in Berlin. Zorach and Pessa's infant son died in 1911. Lev was born a few weeks before his father graduated from the Fachhoschule. About three weeks after Lev's birth, the family returned to their home in Mitava in the Courland region of the Russian Empire (presently Jelgava, Latvia)."
"Aronson's sister, Gerda, was born in 1914, the same year Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated and World War I began. The Russian government, fearing that German and Yiddish-speaking Jews might be or become German spies, took action quickly. On April 18, 1915, the Decree of Expulsion was issued by Czarist Russia, and many Jews were forcibly moved to the interior of Russia. The Aronsons and many other Jews were deported on cattle cars to Voronezh, southeast of Moscow."
"Aronson first heard the cello played by a child of a non-Jewish neighbor in Voronezh. Soon after this, a relative on his mother's side, Nikolai Arnoff, who was a professional cellist, came to Voronezh to give a concert and stayed with the Aronson family. He taught Lev how to hold the instrument and the bow. Lev's father bought him a small cello and arranged with a fellow immigrant, Aron Rafaelovitsch Rubinstein, to teach the child his first cello lessons. Lev was seven."
"In 1920, the family was allowed to leave Voronezh, and they chose to move to Riga, Latvia. Lev attended school in Riga and continued to study cello. As a youth, he performed occasionally with the orchestra at silent movies. Aronson studied cello with Paul Berkowitz, a well-known physician and cellist in Riga."
"Upon his graduation from high school at 16, Aronson moved to Berlin to study law. During his first semester he met a doctor who was an amateur cellist. The doctor, after hearing Aronson play, introduced him to Julius Klengel in Leipzig. Aronson began studying cello with Klengel and soon gave up law to focus on music. After a year with Klengel, Lev began his studies with Alfred von Glehn at the Klindworth-Scharwenka Conservatory in Berlin. When von Glehn died, Gregor Piatigorsky took over his class. Piatigorsky was to become Aronson's life-long mentor and friend. Aronson began performing locally with three German friends in the Peters String Quartet in 1931."
"In 1933, Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany. Anti-Jewish violence in Germany and throughout Europe was on the rise. Aronson decided to change his name to Lev Arnoff, which sounded more Russian than Jewish in an attempt to escape attention and continue performing. Aronson found a patroness, Mrs. Daliba Jones, whom he met in Florence through American conductor Vladimir Shavitch, and began to build a successful performing career throughout Europe as a soloist. He won a competition in Russia. He made several recordings for the Bellacord Electro label. In 1937, he became principal cellist for the Philharmonic Orchestra of Libau. During the late 1930s, Aronson also began teaching cello in Riga, awakening a passion for education that would stay with him for the rest of his life."
"German forces invaded and occupied Riga in June 1941. Aronson's cellos were confiscated. Aronson began work as a slave laborer for the Gestapo. The Jews were moved to a ghetto in the so-called Moscow suburb of Riga. Between November 29 and December 8, 1941, thousands of Jews living in the Riga Ghetto were taken to the Rumbula forest, shot, and buried in mass graves. Among them were Aronson's parents."
"Aronson worked at the clothing depot, Ausekla, for much of the period between the German invasion and 1943. In 1943, the Riga-Kaiserwald concentration camp system was formally established. Many Jews already lived and worked at satellite work camps in the region, which were now considered to be part of the Kaiserwald system. The Riga Ghetto was liquidated, moving the Jews from one horrible situation to another. Most Jews from the ghetto or satellite camps passed through Kaiserwald briefly on their way to work assignments within the system. Aronson worked at the Lenta subcamp, and outgrowth of Ausekla."
"In the fall of 1944, the Germans fled Latvia ahead of the Russian advance. Aronson and a number of other Jews from Kaiserwald and its subcamps, including his sister, were deported to the Stutthof concentration camp. Aronson's sister died at Stutthof."
"From Stutthof, Aronson was transferred to Burggraben and worked in the Danzig shipyards. In 1945, the Germans again moved their Jewish prisoners ahead of the Ally advance. Aronson was among one of the many groups of Jews sent on death marches in the early months of 1945. His group made it to Gotentov (near Lauenberg), where they were liberated on March 10, 1945, by the Russians."
"Aronson, along with many other survivors, was sent to a Soviet repatriation camp in Torun, Poland. Aronson managed to escape and made his way with the help of the Jewish underground through Poland and Germany to the American militarized zone, where he spent nearly two years waiting to be allowed to immigrate to the United States. During his flight, Aronson met dancer Nina Bukowska, and the two fell in love and were married in 1947."
"Some of the musicians from the Riga ghetto survived the war in the same camps as Aronson; the tenor Gregor Shelkan was one of them. After the war, Aronson and Shelkan, memorializing those who died in the war, composed several original pieces. A few of these compositions were published in the Displaced Persons camp Schlachtensee in the American zone of Berlin."
"Aronson and Bukowska immigrated to the United States in 1948. He accepted a contract with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra and moved to Texas. Aronson served as assistant principal cellist in the Dallas Symphony for the 1948-1949 season and then as principal until 1967. Aronson taught cello at Baylor University in Waco, Texas, from 1967 until 1980. In 1980, Aronson began teaching at Southern Methodist University. In the 1970s, Aronson collaborated with Croatian cellist and composer, Rudolf Matz, producing the two volume work, The Complete Cellist."
"Bukowska and Aronson moved to Dallas together but later divorced. Aronson married Deane Wright in 1959 and was subsequently divorced. He married Harriet Snodgrass, a fellow cellist and former pupil, in 1979."
"Lev Aronson died in Dallas on November 12, 1988. In 1990, he was posthumously awarded the ""Chevalier du violoncello"" by the Janzer Foundation."
"Though a talented performer, Lev Aronson is perhaps best-known as an influential teacher of the cello. During his tenure in the Dallas Symphony, he taught several private cello students. After his retirement from the orchestra, he dedicated more time to teaching, privately and at his university appointments. He founded and conducted the Dal-Hi Chamber Players, a group of young musicians who performed in the United States and abroad in the 1970s. He taught and judged at numerous music festivals, workshops, and competitions. He even taught a course for the Southern Methodist University Continuing Education program, which introduced adults to western art music."
"Aronson's students include Lynn Harrell, Ralph Kirshbaum, Kristi Curb, Brian Thornton, John Sharp, Adron Ming, Brook Pearce, James R. Denton, Christopher Adkins, Laurie Arnold, Alicia Randisi-Hooker, Karen Terbeek, Carol Haski, Philip Taggart, Kevin Dvorak, Richard Pope, Jonathan Reimer, Rebecca Young, and Mitch Maxwell."

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory (or simply IceCube) is a neutrino observatory constructed at the Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station in Antarctica.The project is a recognized CERN experiment (RE10).
"Its thousands of sensors are located under the Antarctic ice, distributed over a cubic kilometre."
"Similar to its predecessor, the Antarctic Muon And Neutrino Detector Array (AMANDA), IceCube consists of spherical optical sensors called Digital Optical Modules (DOMs), each with a photomultiplier tube (PMT) and a single-board data acquisition computer which sends digital data to the counting house on the surface above the array. IceCube was completed on 18 December 2010."
"DOMs are deployed on strings of 60 modules each at depths between 1,450 and 2,450 meters into holes melted in the ice using a hot water drill. IceCube is designed to look for point sources of neutrinos in the TeV range to explore the highest-energy astrophysical processes."
In November 2013 it was announced that IceCube had detected 28 neutrinos that likely originated outside the Solar System.
"IceCube is part of a series of projects developed and supervised by the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Collaboration and funding are provided by numerous other universities and research institutions worldwide. Construction of IceCube was only possible during the Antarctic austral summer from November to February, when permanent sunlight allows for 24-hour drilling. Construction began in 2005, when the first IceCube string was deployed and sufficient data was collected to verify that the optical sensors functioned correctly. In the 2005–2006 season, an additional eight strings were deployed, making IceCube the largest neutrino telescope in the world."
Construction was completed on 17 December 2010. The total cost of the project was $279 million.
"Barco is not mentioned in the ""Inquirições"" (Inquiries) of 1288, although it is known to have existed at that time."
"The parish of Barco was established by the 15th century, when it was split off from the priory of St. Silvestre da Covilhã and given its own priest. Even before this, there was a small chapel dedicated to Saint Simon the Zealot."
"Until the 19th century the parish was called St. Simon, after which it assumed the common name of Barco."
"Saint Simon was said to have been martyred by being sawed in half, and the emblem of the parish is a saw."
Between 1860 and 1950 the parish saw rapid population growth.
"The census of 1878 gave Barco a population of 923, of whom 429 were male and 494 female, in 234 dwellings."
"By 1950 there were 1,800 people."
Since then the population has declined steadily.
In 2011 Barco had a population of just 473.
Until recently wolfram and tin were mined in the parish.
"The Mina da Argemela, a tin mine that was abandoned around 1960, is located near Barco."
"Economic activities include trade, industry, agriculture and construction."
"Most people work in agriculture, growing maize, beans, olives and rye."
"Local gastronomical specialties include ""Borelhões"", sausages, river fish and wild boar."
"Religion plays an important role in local culture, as shown by the many small shrines one sees in the countryside."
"Festivals include St. Simon (28 October), San Sebastian (4th Sunday of August), St John (June 23) and Our Lady of Fatima (May 30)."
"Barco has always been part of Covilhã. There was some uncertainty about the extent of its territory, now ."
The boundary between Barco and the neighboring parish of Peso was only defined on 4 October 1894.
From 1872 to 1984 the parish of Coutada was attached to Barco. It was then made a separate parish.
In 2013 Barco was again merged with the parish of Coutada to form the parish of União das Freguesias de Barco e Coutada.

"Plzeňský Prazdroj, a. s. (, known in English as the Pilsner Urquell Brewery, is a Czech brewery founded in 1842 and headquartered in Plzeň, Czech Republic. It was the first brewery to produce pale lager, branded as Pilsner Urquell; the popularity of Pilsner Urquell resulting in it being much copied so that more than two-thirds of the beer produced in the world today is pale lager, sometimes named ""pils"", ""pilsner"" and ""pilsener"" after Pilsner Urquell. The brewery name, ""Pilsner Urquell"", which can be roughly translated into English as ""the original source at Pilsen"", was adopted as a trademark in 1898. Pilsner Urquell is the largest beer producer in the Czech Republic and is also the largest exporter of beer abroad."
"The brewery has been part of the SABMiller group of companies (at the time South African Breweries) since 1999. As part of the agreements made with regulators before Anheuser-Busch InBev was allowed to acquire SABMiller in October 2016, Pilsner Urquell (excluding certain geographical areas) was sold to Japan based Asahi Breweries in March 2017."
"The brewery was founded in 1839 by both local Czech-speaking and German-speaking citizens in Bohemian city of Plzeň as (citizens' brewery, later translated to ""Měšťanský pivovar"" in Czech). The first beer was brewed here in 1842 by Bavarian brewer Josef Groll. In 1859, “Pilsner Bier” was registered as a brand name at the local Chamber of Commerce and Trade. In 1869, a competitor was founded as a joint stock company, later known as Gambrinus. In 1898 the German trademark ""Urquell"" and Czech trademark ""Prazdroj"" were created, to underline the claim of being the older, original source of Pilsner beer. In 1932 ""Měšťanský pivovar"" merged with ""Plzeňské aciové pivovary"". In 1946, the brewery was nationalized under the name ""Plzeňské pivovary"" (Pilsen breweries)."
"After the fall of communism in late 1989, the brewery was turned into a public share company, then renamed in 1994 after the Czech name of their famous beer, ""Plzeňský Prazdroj"". In 1999, they started to merge with "" Pivovar Radegast a.s."" and ""Pivovar Velké Popovice a. s.""."
"The brewery has been part of the SABMiller group of companies (at the time South African Breweries) since 1999. It has been the largest exporter of beer produced in the Czech Republic since 2000 when production surpassed that of Budějovický Budvar. In 2016, the company was sold to Asahi Group Holdings of Japan."
"A brewery museum (""Pivovarské muzeum"") has been set up near the brewery in the authentic medieval brewing house with malt house, which has been declared a cultural monument. It includes the late Gothic malt house, kiln, original drying shed and two-level laying-down cellars with ice-cellar, which are hewn from the Pilsen substrata. The exhibition covers Pilsen's most ancient history, the development of crafts, the emergence and growth of the guilds, the beginnings and development of brewing, malting, the craft of cooper, haulage and catering."
The tour includes a replica of a pub from the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries and a laboratory from the second half of the 19th century. The city walls have been opened with an example of the cultivation of barley and hops.

"On 31 August 2006, Kilbane signed a three-year deal with Wigan Athletic for an estimated fee of £2 million. On 15 April 2007, he scored his first goal for Wigan Athletic with a powerful header in the 3–3 draw against Tottenham Hotspur. This was his first goal at club level since October 2004. He then scored his second goal for Wigan with a looping header over Robert Green's head from Ryan Taylor's cross as Wigan went on to beat West Ham 1–0. Kilbane played most of his second season in the unfamiliar left back role, but still managed to win Wiganer.net's Player of The Season Award."
"With limited first team opportunities at Wigan due to the emergence of Maynor Figueroa and with his contract set to expire in the summer, Kilbane transferred to Hull City on 15 January 2009 for an undisclosed fee believed to be in the region of £500,000, signing a two-and-a-half-year deal with the Yorkshire club. He scored his first goal for the club against Burnley on 10 April 2010."
"On 1 January 2011, as the transfer window reopened, Kilbane joined Football League One side Huddersfield Town on loan until the end of the season, mainly as a replacement for the injured Damien Johnson. He made his debut the same day in the 2–2 draw against Carlisle United at Brunton Park. He scored his first goal for the club in the 4–2 win over Walsall at the Bescot Stadium on 15 January 2011. After signing for Huddersfield, he helped the team to a club record 26 league games unbeaten, before their eventual 3–0 defeat in the playoff final to Peterborough."
"On 2 August 2011, Kilbane joined Derby County on a six-month loan deal from Hull. Kilbane played 10 times for Derby, scoring one goal in a 3–0 win against Doncaster Rovers on 20 August 2011, however Kilbane's loan was cut short on 29 November 2011 due to a back injury."
"On 2 July 2012 Kilbane joined Coventry City on an initial one-year deal. On his debut against Dagenham & Redbridge in the League Cup on 14 August 2012., he scored a late winner from the penalty spot. On 16 August 2012, Kilbane was named captain for the 2012–13 Coventry City's season. He made his final professional appearance as a substitute in a 2–1 defeat at Brentford on 24 October 2012 before announcing his immediate retirement on 8 December 2012."
"While still a youth player at Preston, Kilbane was called up to the England u-18 squad but declined as he had always wished to represent Ireland. Kilbane qualified for the Republic of Ireland team as both his parents are Irish, and he made his international debut against Iceland on 6 September 1997. He was chosen as part of Mick McCarthy's squad for the 2002 FIFA World Cup in Japan and South Korea. The team did relatively well at the tournament, progressing to the knockout stage. They lost to Spain in a penalty shootout when Iker Casillas saved Kilbane and David Connolly's penalties."
"Kilbane scored his first international goal in nearly four years with a magnificent strike against the Czech Republic on 11 October 2006. He scored his 8th international goal on 7 September 2010 against Andorra, the first competitive goal for the Republic of Ireland at the new Aviva Stadium."
"Kilbane won his 100th cap against Montenegro on 14 November 2009. As of 4 June 2011, Kilbane played his 66th consecutive competitive international game (a run stretching back to 1999); only England's Billy Wright has achieved a longer unbroken run in competitive international football. Kilbane was only four games away from equalling Wright's record of 70 consecutive competitive international starts. However this incredible run ended after he was not selected for Ireland's crunch UEFA Euro 2012 qualification tie against Slovakia due to a back injury."
Kilbane obtained a degree in Professional Sports Writing and Broadcasting at Staffordshire University. Kilbane was enlisted by RTÉ Sport for their squad of pundits ahead of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa.
"From 2012 he has been a studio analyst for UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League coverage on TV3 and 3e in Ireland, and is also a regular on Setanta Sports. On 7 April 2013, he made his first appearance as a studio pundit on the BBC One's Match of the Day 2. On 9 May 2013, he made his first appearance on the Guardian Football Weekly Extra podcast."
In 2014 Kilbane was part of the commentary team for the BBC at the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.

"Matthew Rhys Holland (born 11 April 1974) is a former professional footballer, who played as a central midfielder. He began his career at West Ham United and subsequently joined Bournemouth, before spending long spells at Ipswich Town and Charlton Athletic, where he retired in 2009."
"He represented the Republic of Ireland from 1999 to 2006 at international level, earning 49 caps and scoring 5 goals. He was included in their squad for the 2002 FIFA World Cup."
"Since ending his football career he has worked in the media, including with the BBC, Setanta Sports, Talksport, BT Sport and RTÉ."
Initially rejected by Arsenal for being 'too small' he went to West Ham United where he moved up the ranks of the academy but did not play for the first team. He joined Football Conference side Farnborough Town during the 1992–93 season and made twenty-one appearances.
"In order to gain first team football, he joined South Coast side Bournemouth in January 1995. He played a total of 104 games, scoring 18 goals whilst at Dean Court, and also became captain."
"In the summer of 1997, Holland joined Ipswich Town for a fee of £800,000. He again became team captain and"
"captained the club into the Premier League by winning the First Division play-offs in 2000. He captained the club to a fifth-place finish and qualification for the UEFA Cup in their first season in the Premier League in 2001. Though Ipswich were relegated in 2002 he stayed with the club after he turned down a £4 million move to Aston Villa. His spell at Ipswich is remembered for the consistency he showed, after playing 223 consecutive games and only missing one league match (due to international duty) in the six years he was at Portman Road."
"After Ipswich failed to win promotion in 2003, Holland moved back to the Premier League by joining Charlton Athletic on a four-year contract for an initial £750,000 fee, which later rose to £900,000. Again with this move he assumed the captain's armband and was ever-present in his first season for the club. One of the longest-serving Charlton players, he claimed more than half the entire vote for the 2007–08 Fans' Player of the Year. His final match came in a 2–2 draw with Cardiff on 21 April 2009, and the club released him after relegation to League One at the end of the season."
"In July 2009, Holland trained with Colchester United following his release from Charlton in order to keep himself fit."
"Although born in England, Holland qualified to play for the Republic of Ireland through his grandmother who hailed from County Monaghan. He made his international debut on 9 October 1999 in an away Euro 2000 qualifier against Macedonia, playing the last five minutes as a substitute for Mark Kennedy. His first goal came on his fifth cap, the equaliser in a 1–1 draw with Portugal on 7 October 2000 in qualification for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Holland captained the side in three internationals, the first on his 28th cap, a 2–0 friendly defeat to Scotland."
"He went with the Republic of Ireland to the 2002 World Cup scoring the equaliser against Cameroon in their opening game. Ireland were eliminated from this tournament in a Second Round penalty shoot-out against Spain, with Holland among those who missed. Following Ireland's failure to qualify for the 2006 World Cup, he announced his retirement from international football on 5 February 2006 having made 49 appearances and scoring five goals. Manager Steve Staunton had attempted to persuade Holland to continue."

"After John Lennon's murder in December 1980, Starr returned home to England to live at Tittenhurst Park, which Starr had purchased from Lennon in 1973. In early 1982, Starr was eager to move on to his next solo project. Deciding that he needed more consistency this time around, he would work with only one producer, Joe Walsh, a former member of the recently disbanded Eagles. Walsh and Starr had known each other since the mid-1970s, having met and befriended each other in Los Angeles. Walsh immediately agreed to work with Starr and they met at Tittenhurst in February to begin writing material. Recording shortly afterwards begun and instrumental backing tracks for seven songs were recorded at Startling Studios, after Starr had previously converted Lennon's recording studio. Engineering duties were handled by Jim Nipor. These sessions were mainly done with a team consisting of Starr on drums and percussion, Walsh on guitar and backing vocals, Mo Foster on bass and keyboardists Gary Brooker and Chris Stainton."
"Sessions came to a halt when Walsh and Nipor went to California on 19 March. Sessions recommenced on 6 April for a few days until 16 April. On 15 April, ""Rolling Stone"" broke the news that Starr was ""in London working on a new album with Joe Walsh acting as the producer."" Lead vocals were laid down from 19 to 23 April. Sometime in May, Starr requested permission to build a new building on his Tittenhurst Park land, which he would use for video and recording purposes, from Windsor and Maidenhead District Council. Sessions resumed from 31 May until 10 June; the next day, taking the masters recorded up to that point with him, Starr and his wife Barbara Bach fly from London to Los Angeles, and return on 14 June. The album was finished with a third batch of sessions from 24 June into early July."
"""Everybody's in a Hurry But Me"" came about from a jam session between the Who's former bassist, John Entwistle, drummer and percussionist Ray Cooper and also Cream's former guitarist, Eric Clapton. ""As Far as We Can Go"", was originally recorded at Sweet Silence Studios, in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 23 July 1978. From that original rendition, only the vocal was used. Walsh re-recorded an entirely new track utilizing one of the latest technology synthesizers."
"The album was originally titled ""It Beats Sleep"". The portrait on the album cover was shot in a booth in northern England. As Starr's RCA contract had been cancelled, he needed to find a new label for ""Old Wave"". Though it was just over a decade after the Beatles' dissolution, no major UK or US record company was interested in signing him. Starr would not accept that and was determined to have ""Old Wave"" released any way he could. The album was due to be released on the Boardwalk label, but never appeared due to the death of the label's head, Neil Bogart. RCA Canada ended up distributing the album in June 1983 in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, the Netherlands, Mexico, and Brazil; while in Germany, the album and lone single pulled from it, both released on 16 June, appeared on the Bellaphon label. The Canadian release of the album occurred on 24 June. However, ""Old Wave"" failed to achieve success in any of these territories, and would be Starr's last studio album until 1992's ""Time Takes Time"". Two singles were pulled from the album: one in Germany, ""In My Car"", backed with ""As Far as We Can Go"", and the other in Mexico (""I Keep Forgettin'"" b/w ""She's About a Mover"")."
"Walsh's 1987 album ""Got Any Gum?"" included a cover of ""In My Car"", which was released as a single and became a moderate hit. Four tracks from the album appear on Starr's US compilation """" in 1989. The album was reissued on CD, on the same day as ""Stop and Smell the Roses"" (1981), in the US by The Right Stuff on 22 August 1994. A further release, on 6 September, as both CD and cassette deluxe editions, included a bonus track, the original 1978 version of ""As Far as We Can Go"". ""In My Car"" was re-released, this time on yellow vinyl, with ""She's About a Mover"" as the B-side, on The Right Stuff on 1 November 1994. A promotional CD was released in 1994 by Capitol, featuring three songs from both ""Old Wave"" and ""Stop and Smell the Roses""."
Track numbering refers to CD and digital releases of the album.

"The ""Payroll Room"" is how much money in a National Hockey League (NHL) team's salary cap is left to acquire players, whether such players are signed as free agents or join the team via a trade or waivers. The term originated in 2005 with the NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), which was negotiated following a season-long lockout. The new CBA includes a salary cap (formally titled the ""Upper Limit"" of the ""Payroll Range"" in the agreement). Payroll room is often called cap room in the media."
"A team can increase its cap room if it trades high-salary players to other teams and gets lower-paid players in their place. A team cannot trade its cap room to another team or defer its cap room to subsequent seasons. Other practices once common in the NHL, such as exchanging cash for players or agreeing to pay a portion of a player's remaining salary after trading him, have been explicitly forbidden in the new CBA to try to prevent wealthier teams from evading the restrictions of the cap."
"Juana Manuel of Castile (1339 – 27 March 1381) was Queen consort of Castile from 1369 until 1379. She also was the heiress of Escalona, Villena, Peñafiel and Lara, as well as Lady of Biscay."
She was the daughter of the Infante Juan Manuel of Castile (1282–1348) and his second wife Blanca Núñez de Lara de La Cerda. Her mother Blanca (d. 1347) was a descendant of the Lords of Biscay and of Lara and of Alfonso X's eldest son (Fernando de la Cerda). She was the last legitimate member of the House of Ivrea.
"Her father had been for five years a serious enemy of King Alfonso XI, his former protégé, and the king wished to neutralize or absorb the might of the Peñafiel family. Although Juana was not the heiress (yet), already in her youth she had to go along with royal wishes. The king's very influential concubine, Leonor de Guzmán, wanted to obtain some high prestige and property to her eldest son and had her eyes on the young Juana. On 27 July 1350 her brother and guardian, Fernando Manuel of Peñafiel, had to marry his young sister to Henry (1333–79), eldest of the illegitimate sons of Alfonso XI of Castile. This brought Henry certain lands."
"However it was later that Juana's relatives' heirless deaths made Juana the great heiress she turned out to be, while her husband became threat to the royal power. In 1369, he became King Henry II of Castile, after he deposed and murdered his half-brother to take the throne."
They had the following children:
"In 1361 (at the death of her teenage niece Blanca, daughter of her brother Fernando Manuel who himself had died in c 1350 without other children) she inherited Villena, Escalona and Peñafiel. Because Juana was a maternal granddaughter of La Palomilla, from her another cousin, Isabel de Lara who was murdered in 1361 and her young daughter Florentina (d after 1365), she also inherited Lara and Biscay. In 1369, she became queen of Castile and León."
"When in 1381 she died and left her inheritance to her son, Biscay finally was united with Castile, and ultimately Spain. The Basque people remember her for that."
= = = Happy Sad (album) = = =
"Happy Sad is the third album by singer-songwriter Tim Buckley, released in 1969. It was recorded at Elektra Sound Recorders in Los Angeles, California and was produced by former Lovin' Spoonful members Zal Yanovsky and, coincidentally, his subsequent replacement Jerry Yester. It marked the beginning of Buckley's experimental period, as it incorporated elements of jazz that he had never used before. Many of the songs here represent a departure from the binary form that dominated much of his previous work. The sound of the album is characterized by David Friedman's vibraphone, an instrument which gives the album a more relaxed tone than Buckley's earlier work. The songs are much longer than on previous releases and this style continued through to later works. The vocals on the album are more drawn out than earlier performances and this represents the beginning of Buckley using his voice like an instrument. The lyrics on ""Happy Sad"" represent a change as Buckley stopped working with Larry Beckett, his lyricist on the two previous albums ""Tim Buckley"" and ""Goodbye and Hello"", and began writing the lyrics himself. Buckley's self-penned efforts stand in contrast to Beckett's occasionally political and literary-style work. Buckley would also go on to author all his own material on the following two albums."
"""Happy Sad"" shares much in common with his later albums, ""Lorca"" and ""Blue Afternoon"". Much of the material that would appear on those albums was written at the same time as the songs that appear on this album, representing the most productive and prolific period of Buckley's career. Buckley's musical tastes expanded during the period that the album was written and the first track, ""Strange Feelin"", was directly inspired by Miles Davis' ""All Blues"" from ""Kind of Blue"" and the melody of the song is directly taken from the song. ""Buzzin' Fly"" was written much earlier than the rest of the work and was originally performed with a group Buckley had during high school, the Harlequin 3, with bassist Jim Fielder and later lyricist, Larry Beckett."
"The third track, ""Love from Room 109 at the Islander (On Pacific Coast Highway)"", is a song composed of various movements and this represents the second time Buckley wrote in this manner, his previous effort being the title track of ""Goodbye and Hello"". The segments of the song were written separately as ""Danang"" and ""Asbury Park"", as demonstrated on the later released demo sessions, """". The final version of the song is backed by an 'ocean' sound effect, however this was not originally intended to feature on the song. Buckley and the band were happy with the take of song but because of a recording problem the track had a slight electric buzzing in the background. The producer solved this by muffling the buzzing with the ocean overdub."
"""Dream Letter"" is as an ode and apology to his ex-wife, Mary Guibert, and his son Jeff Buckley. This is the second song Buckley wrote about the pair, the first being ""I Never Asked to Be Your Mountain"" on his previous LP, ""Goodbye and Hello"". In comparison to that song ""Dream Letter"" has a more apologetic tone, the lyrics reveal this with Buckley lamenting ""Does he ever ask about me?"" . It would be over five years later that Buckley would meet with his son again. The name of the song would later be used for a live album: posthumous release """". The concert features much of the same personnel from the ""Happy Sad""."
"""Gypsy Woman"" is a long track highlighting Buckley's vocal acrobatics and on the record has some qualities of a jam session. Buckley and his band were disappointed with its recording but the song would remain as part of Buckley's live repertoire for the following years. The closer of the album, ""Sing a Song For You"", is more similar to Buckley's work on ""Goodbye and Hello"" than to the songs on the rest of the album. It shares the verse/chorus style and folk leanings of ""Song to the Siren"", which though released on ""Starsailor"" was written around the same period."
"Released at the height of his popularity, ""Happy Sad"" was his highest charting album, reaching #81 in the US Pop albums chart, but Buckley's experimentation on this album would alienate some of the fanbase and his mainstream appeal he gained with ""Goodbye and Hello"". However, this was only the beginning of Buckley's experimentation with sound and genre, and subsequent releases would further reduce his mainstream popularity and see his sales take a downturn."

= = = Tomb of the Triclinium = = =
"The Tomb of the Triclinium () or the Funereal Bed ("""") is an Etruscan tomb in the Necropolis of Monterozzi near Tarquinia, Italy. It was discovered in 1830. Stefan Steingraber, Associate Professor at the Italian Research University 'Roma Tre', dates the tomb to approximately 470 BC and calls it one of the most famous of all Etruscan tombs. He considers the artistic quality of the tomb's frescoes to be superior to those of most other Etruscan tombs. The tomb is named after the triclinium, the formal dining room which appears in the frescoes of the tomb."
Since its discovery the tomb's frescoes have deteriorated and lost some of their color and detail. In 1949 they were moved to the Tarquinia National Museum to conserve them. Thanks to the watercolor copies made by Carlo Ruspi shortly after the discovery of the tomb it is still possible to see the frescoes in their former state.
"The tomb consists of a single room. The fresco on the back wall shows a banquet scene, borrowed from depictions of drinking scenes on Attic red-figure pottery from the early fifth century. The banqueteers recline on three couches called ""klinai"". On the floor under the ""klinai"" a cat prowls towards a rooster and a partridge. On the left wall three female dancers, one male dancer and a male musician with a barbiton appear. They are placed between small trees filled with birds. On the right wall a similar scene is shown. On the entry wall two youths jump down from their horses. They may be ""apobates"" or a reference to the Dioscuri as intermediaries between the earthly life and the afterlife."
The similarities between the frescoes in the Tomb of the Triclinium and Tomb 5513 (also in the Necropolis of Monterozzi) led Steingraber to conclude that they were the products of the same workshop. The strong influence of red-figure Attic vase painting has convinced some experts that the artist who decorated the tomb was a Greek metic.
= = = Martha Mears (author) = = =
Martha Mears was an eighteenth-century midwife and author.
"Mears was a midwife, mother, and author in London, England. Her work, ""Pupil of Nature"", was published in 1797. The full title is ""Pupil of Nature: Candid advice to the fair sex, on the subjects of pregnancy, childbirth, the diseases incident to both, the fatal effects of ignorance and quackery, and the most approved means of promoting health, strength and beauty of their offspring."" It consists of 10 essays about topics from the state of the womb before and after conception, to the effect of music on nerves. She depicted the pregnant woman as a cluster of symptoms to be managed, particularly with regard to her psychological state. Mears subscribed to the common notion that ""irritability"" of the pregnant woman’s uterus induced a heightened ""sensibility"". The organization and broad scope of the text mirrored this representation of the body as a bundle of potential pathologies. A contemporary review of her work describes its purpose being to teach women the important advantages of pursuing nature's plans in everything that relates to the pregnant state. Mears' studied the writings of Harvey, Leake, Smellie and Denman."
"Mears' was the last major contributor to the eighteenth-century midwifery dispute. Her work is considered an eighteenth-century version of the popular prenatal guide ""What to Expect When You’re Expecting""."

"Abhay Deol had a falling out with music company T-Series after the composers from his film Shankar Ehsaan Loy were asked to sign, what they believed to be illegal clauses which would hand over their [the author's] rights to royalty over to the music company. Abhay Deol took to social media and blamed T-Series for delaying the music launch of his film as well as not promoting the movie due to him and the composers not agreeing to sign the documents. This allegation was denied by T-Series who claimed that they had uploaded 3 songs from the movie on its YouTube page and claimed ""In the absence thereof [of appropriate agreements], we cannot be expected to release music when there is no clarity with respect to the rights granted to the producer"" In another statement, T-Series expressed the fact that they had been assured by the company Viacom 18 that they owned all the rights (including the music rights) and that they did not understand why they were being dragged into this dispute which should be between Mr. Deol and Viacom 18. T-Series eventually relinquished their hold on the music rights after a campaign was run by the composers and artists against the music company. Eventually the music for the film was launched after music companies Crecendo and Unisys who took over, with the former releasing the physical copies and the latter releasing the digital copies of the music online.

"George Emil Eminsang (ca. 1833 – May 1898) was a prominent Euro-African merchant and political leader on the Gold Coast, who played a prominent role in the last years of Dutch colonial rule on the Gold Coast. After the Dutch Gold Coast was transferred to the United Kingdom, Eminsang became a diplomat for the Netherlands and later for the United States and the Congo Free State. Together with James Bannerman Hyde and James Hutton Brew, Eminsang was one of the first so-called ""country lawyers"" on the Gold Coast."
"Eminsang was an important leader of the No. 10 Akrampafo ""asafo"" ward of Elmina and owner of the most famous hotel of Elmina, St. George's Hotel. Besides his native Twi, he spoke and wrote Dutch, English, Portuguese and German."
"Eminsang was born in Elmina to Joseph Emil Eminsang, a merchant and innkeeper, and an unknown lady from a prominent Dutch/Fanti Euro-African family. He was educated in the Netherlands and Germany, before returning to teach for several years at the Elmina Castle School, where he had completed his primary education."
"In the 1850s, Eminsang established himself as a merchant on the Gold Coast. In 1859, while doing business in Kumasi, Eminsang had a conflict with the Asante chief Kwasi Brantuo, whose porters lost five textiles from a shipment Eminsang had ordered from Anomabu. Asantehene Kwaku Dua I Panyin ruled in favour of Eminsang and ordered that Brantuo pay 15 Engels compensation to Eminsang. Eminsang still refused to pay the wages of the porters, however, leading Brantuo to complain to Asante chief Akyempon Yaw, who regulated Elmina affairs in Kumasi. The conflict became so heated that the Dutch agent in Kumasi, Pieter de Heer, offered to pay Eminsang's debt from his own pocket, but Eminsang flatly refused and swore a Coromantee oath that no payment would take place. After Eminsang started to insult the Asantehene, he was arrested and imprisoned. Eventually, Pieter de Heer managed to persuade Asantehene Kwaku Dua to release Eminsang to send him for trial by the Dutch governor in Elmina."
"Eminsang played a prominent role in colonial affairs in the last years of Dutch rule on the Gold Coast. When in 1868 the Fante Confederacy tried to take Elmina in the aftermath of the redistribution of Dutch and British forts on the Gold Coast, Eminsang was sent by the Elmina government to the Netherlands to plead the case for Elmina with Minister of the Colonies Engelbertus de Waal. After meeting with Eminsang, De Waal proceeded in replacing governor George Pieter Willem Boers with the experienced former governor Cornelis Nagtglas, who as a government commissioner was tasked with finding a solution for the conflict with the Fante."

"Govenlock is an unincorporated community within Rural Municipality of Reno No. 51, Saskatchewan, Canada. Previously held the status of a village with a peak population of 151 residents, until its village status was dissolved on January 1, 1976. The former townsite of Govenlock is located on Highway 21 & Highway 13 also known as the historic Red Coat Trail, about 15 km east of the Alberta-Saskatchewan border. Very little remains of the former village of Govenlock, many cement foundations and wooden sidewalks can still be found scattered around the town site, the only building that still stands as of 2010 is the old community hall and a commemorative plaque in remembrance of Govenlock's rich history."
"Govenlock, like so many other small communities throughout Saskatchewan, has struggled to maintain a sturdy population causing it to become a completely abandoned ""ghost town"" with a population of 0 citizens. Prior to January 1, 1976, Govenlock was incorporated under village status, but was dissolved into an unincorporated community under the jurisdiction of the Rural municipality of Reno on that date."
"In 2006, Govenlock had a population of 0 living in 0 dwellings, a 0% increase from 2001. The community had a land area of and a population density of ."
"In 1910, a Moose Jaw resident by the name of William Govenlock moved to the area with his family after applying for a homestead. They were one of the first pioneer families of Southwest Saskatchewan. In 1913, William negotiated a land deal with the Canadian Pacific Railway, starting a new town later named in his honour. That same year William established a post office for the area, with his wife Bessie as the first postmaster."
"In 1914 a pioneer named John Linder built Govenlock's first Hotel. The hotel stood two stories tall with ten rooms. Three years later a man named James Gaff stopped at the Hotel for a rest; after finding out that no rooms were available James immediately purchased the hotel for $4,500."
"Even though the liquor trade was big business during that time, Govenlock's future looked promising even without the steady stream of liquor. The town boasted its impressive CPR station, section house, a few grain elevators, two general stores, blacksmith shops, a livery barn, two machine agencies, pool room, laundromat, school, meat shop, a service station selling Model T Fords, and a hotel. Most of these businesses were connected by wooden sidewalks, a common feature in the pioneer prairie days."
"After Montana's prohibition declaration in 1919, large groups of Americans from that state frequently crossed the border by train to visit Govenlock to purchase booze."
"Indicating that Govenlock had a promising future, the pioneer town had a chamber of commerce. It was the liquor trade that fuelled Govenlock's prosperity. Four liquor warehouses were established in the centre to serve a booming liquor trade. With liquor trade and the frequent influx of imbibers, gambling and parties became common, attracting not only thirsty folks from across the border, but many bachelors from all parts of Southwestern Saskatchewan who wanted to let loose."
"Over the years a poolroom and two-story dancehall building was built and owned by Henry Buss. During the early days, Govenlock was a place for people of both countries to socialize and relax. As the American booze customers waited for their liquor orders, many would mingle with the people of Govenlock and settle down for a game of pool or a game of high-stakes poker. Revelry and good times were staples in Govenlock during their early days."
"Busy American booze traders were also a staple in Govenlock. To avoid legal problems, bootleggers would have to obtain a tourist pass at Canada border entry points. They would come to the pioneer town in their Fords, Studebakers, Packards, and Hudsons. The empty cars' rears were filled with sand bags until they filled up at the liquor houses. This was done to avoid suspicion when they rode empty of booze, light without a load. Canadian beer cost 12 cents per bottle and was said to be highly prized. Whiskey was more expensive and more lucrative. It was transported in barrels. Each barrel had three burlap sacks, with 24 four-quart bottles - wrapped in straw - in each sack. A barrel wholesaled for $24. When it reached the United States, it sold for $140. A carload of 14 barrels of beer and five cases of whiskey could fetch a profit of $2,500."
"The bootlegging trade was good business for several years and there were few legal hassles for the rumrunners. Mounties and provincial police intervened to ensure that the liquor went through the hands of locals before crossing the United States border. Even a few of the Govenlock residents tried their hand at bootlegging, but they soon found out that more of the liquor was stolen than they sold."
"When 1922 rolled around, so did the end of bootlegging that fueled Govenlock's prosperity. It was then that the Government of Saskatchewan announced it wanted better control of the liquor trade and restricted liquor export houses to cities with 10,000 people or more. This started the slow end of the once promising pioneer town of Govenlock. Over the years and one by one, stores and shops soon closed and residents left. In 1962 the only grain elevator left in Govenlock was toppled and demolished. By 1990, rural municipality officials brought in the bulldozers and demolished all but one of the remaining buildings that stood in Govenlock, including the old Govenlock Hotel."
"The only building left is the community hall, built in 1948. Also a commemorative plaque marks the area where Govenlock was located. It honors Govenlock's wild past and wild spirit of its hell-raising pioneer days."

"There is no official Triple Crown for these Melbourne races, but racing fans consider these three Group 1 races to be the major interconnected component of the spring carnival package, while also acknowledging that only a superhorse could win them all in the same season to complete a . Only one horse has ever managed this feat, the great New Zealand galloper Rising Fast, in 1954. More recently, popular Might and Power won all three races, though not in the same year."
"The ""Spring Grand Slam"" in Melbourne is considered by some in the racing industry to be more difficult to win than the famous Triple Crown in the United States because the Australian races contain many more variables."
"The Triple Crown — involving the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes — is contested only by three-year-olds who race over distances between 1910 metres (Preakness) and 2400 metres (Belmont). The horses all carry the same weight (fillies a little less than colts and geldings), and none of the horses are being asked to race around the track in an unaccustomed direction."
"In Melbourne, the races are open to all horses aged three and over, and they race between 2,040 metres (Cox Plate) and 3,200 metres (Melbourne Cup)."
"The weight carried by horses can vary immensely, both in each race and from race to race, because three different handicapping systems are employed. The Caulfield Cup is a handicap race, the Cox Plate is a weight-for-age race, and the Melbourne Cup is a combination of both, a weight-for-age-handicap."
"Furthermore, in the U.S., horses race counter-clockwise on all tracks, but in Australia and New Zealand, there are both clockwise and counter-clockwise tracks. All ""Spring Grand Slam"" races in Melbourne are raced counter-clockwise, so horses domiciled in areas with predominantly clockwise tracks can be disoriented and not perform to potential."

= = = Rule of 78s = = =
"Also known as the sum-of-the-digits method, the Rule of 78s is a term used in lending that refers to a method of yearly interest calculation. The name comes from the total number of months' interest that is being calculated in a year (the first month is 1 month's interest, whereas the second month contains 2 months' interest, etc.). This is an accurate interest model only based on the assumption that the borrower pays only the amount due each month. If the borrower pays off the loan early, this method maximizes the amount paid (interest paid) by applying funds to interest before principal. In other words, in comparison to a simple interest loan, a rule of 78s loan will charge more interest if the loan is paid early."
"A simple fraction (as with 12/78) consists of a numerator (the top number, 12 in the example) and a denominator (the bottom number, 78 in the example). The denominator of a Rule of 78 loan is the sum of the digits, the sum of the number of monthly payments in the loan. For a twelve-month loan, the sum of numbers from 1 to 12 is 78 (1 + 2 + 3 + . . . +12 = 78). For a 24-month loan, the denominator is 300. The sum of the numbers from 1 to n is given by the equation n * (n+1) / 2. If n were 24, the sum of the numbers from 1 to 24 is 24 * (24+1) / 2 = 12 x 25 = 300, which is the loan's denominator, D."
"For a 12-month loan, 12/78s of the finance charge is assessed as the first month's portion of the finance charge, 11/78s of the finance charge is assessed as the second month's portion of the finance charge and so on until the 12th month at which time 1/78s of the finance charge is assessed as that month's portion of the finance charge. Following the same pattern, 24/300 of the finance charge is assessed as the first month's portion of a 24-month precomputed loan."
Formula for calculating the unearned interest:
formula_1
"where formula_2 is the unearned interest, formula_3 is the total agreed finance charges, formula_4 is the number of months paying off early, formula_5 is the total term of loan in months"
"The earliest official use of the Rule of 78s to calculate the unearned portion of a loan's finance charge was in Indiana in 1935. Most loans in 1935 were for small amounts at low interest rates for short periods of time. It reduced the cost of loan calculations in a pre-computer era and was well suited for the small, short, and low interest rate loans of the era."
"In the United States, the use of the Rule of 78s is prohibited in connection with mortgage refinancings and other consumer loans having a term exceeding 61 months."
"On March 15, 2001, in the U.S. 107th Congress, U.S. Rep. John LaFalce (D-NY 29), introduced H.R. 1054, a bill to eliminate the use of the Rule of 78s in credit transactions. The bill was referred to the House Committee on Financial Services on the same day. On April 10, 2001, the bill was referred to the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit, where it died with no further action taken."
"In the UK, as part of the Consumer Credit Act of 2005, the Consumer Credit (Early Settlement) Regulations 2004 (SI 2004/1483) which does away with the Rule of 78 in consumer credit lending was issued and brought into effect on 31 May 2005."
"The Rule of 78s deals with precomputed loans, which are loans whose finance charge is calculated before the loan is made. Finance charge, carrying charges, interest costs, or whatever the cost of the loan may be called, can be calculated with simple interest equations, add-on interest, an agreed upon fee, or any disclosed method. Once the finance charge has been identified, the Rule of 78s is used to calculate the amount of the finance charge to be rebated (forgiven) in the event that the loan is repaid early, prior to the agreed upon number of payments. It should be understood that with precomputed loans, a borrower not only owes the lender the principal amount borrowed, but the borrower owes the finance charge as well. If $10,000 is lent and the precomputed finance charge is $3,000, the borrower owes the lender $13,000 at the time the loan is made, whereas a simple interest borrower owes the lender only the $10,000 principal and monthly interest on the unpaid principal."
"A simple explanation would be as follows: suppose that the total finance charge for a 12-month loan was $78.00. That figure is representative of the sum of digits by adding the numbers together, i.e., 12,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1 = 78. If a person repaid a consumer loan after 3 months, the financial institution would refund the sum of the ""remaining"" digits...(i.e. 9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1 or $45.00. In essence, they would retain the first three (3) numbers...12,11,10 or $33.00. Thus the consumer would not receive as much of a refund if it were divided equally by 12 months ($6.50 per month). Under this scenario they would have received a refund of $58.50, which is more beneficial than the $45.00 refund."

"The Rising of the North of 1569, also called the Revolt of the Northern Earls or Northern Rebellion, was an unsuccessful attempt by Catholic nobles from Northern England to depose Queen Elizabeth I of England and replace her with Mary, Queen of Scots."
"Elizabeth I succeeded her half-sister Mary I as queen of England in 1558. Elizabeth's accession was disputed due to the questioned legitimacy of the marriage of her parents – Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. Under Henry VIII and his advisor Thomas Cromwell, power was gradually shifted from regional institutions to royal control. This course was encouraged by Elizabeth's counsellors such as William Cecil and a policy of centralization was the approach favoured by Elizabeth herself at least in regards to the northern border region."
"Opponents of Elizabeth looked to Mary, Queen of Scots, the descendant of Henry VIII's sister Margaret. The claims were initially put forward by Mary's father-in-law, King Henry II of France, and Mary upheld them after her return to Scotland in 1561."
"Many English Catholics, then a significant portion of the population, supported Mary's claim as a way to restore Roman Catholicism. This position was especially strong in Northern England, where several powerful nobles were Roman Catholics; there had been similar risings against Henry VIII; the Pilgrimage of Grace of 1536 and Bigod's Rebellion of 1537. Supporters of Mary hoped for aid from France (among Scots) and possibly Spain (among English). Mary's position was strengthened by the birth of her son, James, in 1566 but weakened again when she was deposed in July 1567."
"The rebellion was led by Charles Neville, 6th Earl of Westmorland, and Thomas Percy, 7th Earl of Northumberland. Seven hundred knights assembled at Brancepeth Castle. In November 1569 Westmorland and Northumberland occupied Durham. Thomas Plumtree celebrated Mass in Durham Cathedral. From Durham, the rebels marched south to Bramham Moor, while Elizabeth struggled to raise forces sufficient to confront them. But, hearing of a large force being raised by the Earl of Sussex, the rebels abandoned plans to besiege York, and captured Barnard Castle instead. They proceeded to Clifford Moor, but found little popular support. Sussex marched out from York on 13 December 1569 with 10,000 men against the rebels' 6,000, and was followed by 12,000 men under Baron Clinton. The rebel earls retreated northward and finally dispersed their forces, fleeing into Scotland."
"A questionable role in the rebellion was played by Leonard Dacre, an early sympathiser of Mary. At the outbreak of the rebellion, he travelled to Elizabeth's court at Windsor to claim the heritage of his young nephew, the 5th Baron Dacre. After the latter's untimely death in 1569, this had descended to his sisters, all married to sons of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk. Dacre returned to Northern England, ostensibly a faithful partisan of Elizabeth, but his intentions remain unclear."
"After the retreat of the rebels, he seized Greystoke Castle and fortified his own Naworth Castle, where he gathered 3,000 Cumbrian troops and tried to keep up the appearance of good relations with the Queen. He held out against a siege of the royal army under Baron Hunsdon but then attacked the retreating army at Gelt River. Though Hunsdon was outnumbered, he charged Dacre's foot with his cavalry, killing 300–400 and capturing 200–300 men. Dacre escaped via Scotland to Flanders, where he died in exile."
"Two of the rebellion's leaders, the Earls of Northumberland and Westmorland, had fled into Scotland. Northumberland was captured by James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton, and turned over to Elizabeth in 1572, who had him beheaded at York. After having been hidden at Ferniehirst Castle, Westmorland escaped to Flanders, where he died impoverished. His family lost their ancestral homes and his wife, Jane Howard, also fled to the Continent. She lived the rest of her life under house arrest. Her brother, the Duke of Norfolk, was first imprisoned, then pardoned. He was imprisoned again following the Ridolfi plot in 1571 and finally executed in 1572. Norfolk's treason charges included ""comforting and relieving of the English rebels that stirred the Rebellion in the North since they have fled out of the realm."" Altogether, 600 supporters of Mary were executed, while many others fled into exile."
"Queen Elizabeth declared martial law, exacting terrible retribution on the ordinary folk of the Yorkshire Dales, despite the lack of any popular support for the Earls' Rising, with her demand for at least 700 executions. The victims of this purge were, as a contemporary account said ""wholly of the meanest sort of people"", so that hardly a village escaped the sight of a public hanging. (Source: )"
"In 1570, Pope Pius V had tried to aid the rebellion by excommunicating Elizabeth and declaring her deposed in the papal bull ""Regnans in Excelsis"", but the document did not arrive until the rebellion had been suppressed. The bull gave Elizabeth more reason to view Catholics with suspicion. It inspired conspiracies to assassinate her, starting with the Ridolfi plot."
"In 1587, Elizabeth brought Mary, Queen of Scots, to trial for treason; she was convicted by the court and executed."
"The Rising of the North is the main conflict in the historical drama film ""Mary Queen of Scots"" (2018)."

"WEZB (97.1 MHz) is a commercial FM radio station licensed to New Orleans, Louisiana. Owned by Entercom, it broadcasts a Top 40 (CHR) radio format. It rarely uses its call sign, instead calling itself B97 FM. The studios and offices are located at the 400 Poydras Tower in Downtown New Orleans. The station airs the syndicated Kidd Kraddick Morning Show from KHKS Dallas on weekdays."
"WEZB has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 100,000 watts, the maximum for FM radio stations. The transmitter site is off Behrman Highway in the city's Algiers neighborhood. The signal covers much of Southeastern Louisiana and Southwestern Mississippi. WEZB broadcasts in the HD Radio hybrid format. The HD2 subchannel carries Entercom's Channel Q service, primarily for LGBTQ listeners."
"On September 1, 1945, 97.1 signed on the air. This was WRCM, the FM simulcast of AM 990 WJMR (now WGSO) and sister station to WJMR-TV 12 (now WVUE channel 8), all owned by George J. Mayoral. Then, around 1966–67 after the TV station had already been sold, the Supreme Broadcasting Company bought the two radio stations and changed the call signs to WNNR and WNNR-FM. At the time, the stations were located in the Jung Hotel at 1500 Canal Street in downtown New Orleans. WNNR-FM had a power of only 20,500 watts from an antenna 310 feet atop the building, a fraction of its current wattage and antenna height."
"On January 2, 1972, EZ Communications acquired the FM station. It became WEZB, part of a chain of Beautiful Music stations such as WEZC Charlotte, WEZR Washington and others owned by EZ. While it was profitable, it was not able to best WWL-FM (now WLMG) in the easy listening format. Briefly in the 1970s when disco music became a popular genre, 97.1 became ""Disco 97 FM"" on Thursday, February 8, 1979. But the disco era was short, with WEZB switching to a rhythmic contemporary sound, called """"FM 97, The Rhythm Of The City!"""" ""We had a big party in the Atrium at the Hyatt Regency Hotel"" says Jimmy Roberts, B97 FM's first BJ, the station's version of a DJ. On January 1, 1980, ""Baby New Year was dropped from the ceiling and we switched over from being ""FM 97, The Rhythm Of The City!"" to ""The New B97 FM""."""
"At ""HM"", Sarah Brehm said that ""Restart is packed with tracks that compete with the quality of today's current mainstream pop music, and the lyrics are much more positive, encouraging and wholesome than what is on the radio"", and that ""unlike their previous albums as it's packed with electrifying beats rivaling radio pop music."" Sarah Fine at New Release Tuesday wrote that this release was different from any of their past albums, yet stated that ""The production quality is nearly flawless, and lyrically, working with some of the best songwriters in the industry shows in the quality of the work. While the lyrics take the band to a whole new level, the group's journey into uncharted sonic waters is the real game changer."" At Jesus Freak Hideout, Mark Rice added that ""It is no great secret that Tait's Boys have been progressively getting more poppy and electronic, but I could never have seen it coming for the Newsboys to venture into the realm of dubstep."""
"At Indie Vision Music, Jonathan Andre wrote that the release was ""Full of powerful lyrics, infectious enthusiasm and pop-dance melodies that are new, fresh and invigorating, the band are able to deliver 16 songs full of intensity, hopefulness, encouragement and powerful truths directly from Scripture."" Dave Wood of Louder Than the Music said that ""This is the new style of modern worship, taken outside of the four walls of the church, and served up on an accessible plate that a secular-influenced generation will enjoy."" At Christian Music Zine, Emily Kjonaas wrote that ""The new-era Newsboys have rediscovered, and solidified, their sound and you can hear it in ""Restart""."" Daniel Edgeman of Christian Music Review wrote that the album was ""filled with how great our God and many other aspects of our Father."" At ""Worship Leader"", Randy Cross stated that ""This isn't just fun music, but lyrics that drive home the purpose that we as Christians embrace"", yet told that ""The musical style of the first four songs is very similar."""
"""Restart"" garnered acclaim from music critics. Sarah Brehm felt the release ""will be a contender for best pop album of the year in the CCM market."" Tony Cummings of Cross Rhythms wrote that ""Wherever you look you'll find cleverly conceived, expertly executed and, most important, spiritually uplifting pop music,"" with the Newsboys ""clearly still a brand leader."" Roger Gelwicks stated that """"Restart"" is the best the Newsboys have ever sounded"" and being ""Comfortable in their own shoes and daring enough to stay interesting, the Newsboys are still a force to be reckoned with, and ""Restart"" is proof.""

CM Addict's Julia Kitzing wrote that the band ""never looked back and their albums just keep getting better."" At Indie Vision Music, Jonathan Andre found this to be ""such a powerful and compelling album"". Dave Wood at Louder Than the Music wrote that he ""really did grow to love it."" At Christian Music Zine, Emily Kjonaas rated the album a 3.25-out-of-five, and felt that because """"Restart"" comes at a time where computerized, auto-tuned music seems to be popular among the mainstream industry"" the release may become ""popular amongst that crowd."" However, she noted that ""Newsboys fans may not find this record enjoyable, but Tait-led fans will enjoy ""Restart""."" On the other hand, Daniel Edgeman at Christian Music Review called this a ""stand out album."" At ""CCM Magazine"", Matt Conner wrote that ""Electronic dance music is here to stay and clearly so are the Newsboys."" DeWayne Hamby, reviewing the album for ""Charisma"", called it ""a new collection of pop-flavored tracks""."

= = = Odette Valery = = =
"Odette Valery (spelled Valéry in French publications), née Helene Vasilardi, (1883–?) was an Italian dancer of Greek parentage. She made her début at La Scala in 1898 at the age of fifteen. She moved to Paris where she danced with the Ballet Excelsior at the Folies Bergère. She came to regard dancing ""en pointe"" as ""old-fashioned"" and made her name doing reconstructions of ancient Greek dances in bare feet. Later she portrayed Cleopatra and did an Egyptian dance with a live asp. She was well-educated and spoke French, German, Italian, Spanish and Russian as well as some English and she played the piano well. In 1908, she caused a sensation in New York when she danced in the last act of ""Samson and Delilah"" at the Manhattan Opera House where she had been engaged by Oscar Hammerstein I. Her dance included the participation of one of three snakes (with fangs removed) which were cared for by their own groom, Robert, whom she had engaged in addition to other servants who travelled with her. In 1910 she was earning $1000 a week when dancing in the Teatro Comunale di Bologna. She owned several automobiles and amassed a fortune in jewellery. She spent lavishly and by 1912, she was destitute. Her money ran out when she had to have an operation and as a result she could not work for an extended period. Although her weekly salary was what a workman earned in a year at the time, she hadn't saved a penny. She was found ill and starving in a cheap boarding house in Notting Hill, London where she was being cared for by her seven-year-old son Gaeton. She had been surviving thus for a year by pawning her jewellery. She was found by a friend who was performing at Hammerstein's London Opera House. The friend took her in and was planning to send her back to her home in France to recover. She returned to Paris and although she was reputed to have had twenty-eight love affairs in one year at the height of her fame, she had few real friends and continued to live in poverty. It was a California heiress, Mrs. Jackson Gouraud, who came to her aid on reading about her plight and gave a fund-raising ball in her honour at Martin's, New York. The hostess wore a live python around her neck for the event."

"A member of the Homo mermanus race, Andromeda is the illegitimate daughter of Attuma of Atlantis by a woman named Lady Gelva. He did not know of her existence until she confronted him and told him he was her father. Andromeda was raised in Atlantean society and trained in the arts of hunting and war and she exceeded any other male except for her father in these skills. Despite her skills, she was considered unworthy of promotion in the Atlantean military because she is a woman even though she was highly decorated."
"Andromeda, inspired by Namor's tales, moved to the surface world, where she used a serum to give herself a human appearance and the ability to breathe out of water. She took the name Andrea McPhee and posed as a surface woman. When she was revealed as an Atlantean, she quickly abandoned her charade and became a member of the Defenders, joining them against a villain named Hotspur."
"She was with the Defenders, christened the ""New Defenders,"" for only a short time, revealing only portions of her background to them. With them, she traveled to outer space and battled the second Star-Thief. She fought Manslaughter as he menaced the team, and then aided the Defenders and the Interloper in battle against fellow Defender Moondragon, and the Dragon of the Moon who was possessing Moondragon. Andromeda sacrificed her life force, joining with Manslaughter, the Valkyrie, and the Interloper to drive the Dragon of the Moon from the Earth, and her body was turned to stone."
"The Dragon would later return, this time without a body. To stop the Dragon of the Moon, Doctor Strange cast a spell which returned the souls of the Defenders fallen in the battle against the Dragon to the bodies of several recently deceased humans, changing them into duplicates of the Defenders. Andromeda's soul entered the body of Genevieve Cross and these Defenders now called themselves the Dragon Circle. Together the Dragon Circle banished the Dragon from Earth and Andromeda returned to the oceans."
"Andromeda played an important part in the 1989 ""Atlantis Attacks"" crossover. Andromeda led a rebellion to stop her father Attuma from invading the surface world, but was bested by Attuma in personal combat. She was kidnapped unconscious by the Deviant priest Ghaur as one of his ""Seven Brides of Set."" Under Ghaur's domination, she accompanied She-Hulk to acquire a piece of Set's life force. In the end the Brides of Set gained their freedom thanks to the Fantastic Four and Avengers."
"Andromeda joined her forces with those of Namor. She was part of the short-lived Deep Six, a group of underwater heroes. During this time her mind and that of Genevieve Cross would repeatedly exchange control and even turn her body into a copy of Genevieve's. Andromeda sacrificed her own mind to save Namor's soul, leaving Genevieve in control of Andromeda's body. Months later, either Genevieve in Andromeda's body or a restored Andromeda herself assisted Namor and the Defenders against Attuma's own Deep Six. Andromeda was last seen as an ally of Namor, living in Atlantis."
Andromeda later appears as a member of Namor's Defenders of the Deep.
"Andromeda has all the powers inherent to the ""Homo mermanus"", but her strength and speed are far greater than that of any ordinary ""Homo mermanus"", though not as great as that of her father, Attuma. She is adapted to live underwater, having gills that allow her to breathe underwater, she can swim at high speeds and her body is resistant to the pressure and the cold of the deep oceans. Her specially-developed vision allows her to see clearly in the murky depths of the ocean."
"She can survive only for 10 minutes out of water, unless she uses a special serum that gives her the ability to breathe air. Her stamina, agility, and reflexes are reduced when out of the water."
"She has been trained as an Atlantean warrior, and is very skilled in the arts of hunting and war, wielding a trident as her weapon of choice. She carries a short sword and an 8"" dagger as additional weaponry."
Andromeda also has extensive knowledge of biochemistry.
= = = Great Hinckley Fire = = =
"The Great Hinckley Fire was a conflagration in the pine forests of the U.S. state of Minnesota in September 1894, which burned an area of at least (perhaps more than ), including the town of Hinckley. The official death count was 418; the actual number of fatalities was likely higher."
"After a two-month summer drought, combined with very high temperatures, several small fires started in the pine forests of Pine County, Minnesota. The fires' spread apparently was due to the then-common method of lumber harvesting, wherein trees were stripped of their branches in place; these branches littered the ground with flammable debris. Also contributing was a temperature inversion that trapped the gases from the fires. The scattered blazes united into a firestorm. The temperature rose to at least . Barrels of nails melted into one mass, and in the yards of the Eastern Minnesota Railroad, the wheels of the cars fused with the rails. Some residents escaped by climbing into wells, ponds, or the Grindstone River. Others clambered aboard two crowded trains that pulled out of the threatened town minutes ahead of the fire."
"James Root, an engineer on a train heading south from Duluth, rescued nearly 300 people by backing up a train nearly five miles to Skunk Lake, where the passengers escaped the fire. William Best was an engineer on a train sent specifically to evacuate people."
According to the Hinckley Fire Museum:
"Because of the dryness of the summer, fires were common in the woods, along railroad tracks and in logging camps where loggers would set fire to their slash to clean up the area before moving on. Some loggers, of course left their debris behind, giving any fire more fuel on which to grow. Saturday, September 1st, 1894 began as another oppressively hot day with fires surrounding the towns and two major fires that were burning about five miles (8 km) to the south. To add to the problem, the temperature inversion that day added to the heat, smoke and gases being held down by the huge layer of cool air above. The two fires managed to join together to make one large fire with flames that licked through the inversion finding the cool air above. That air came rushing down into the fires to create a vortex or tornado of flames which then began to move quickly and grew larger and larger turning into a fierce firestorm. The fire first destroyed the towns of Mission Creek and Brook Park before coming into the town of Hinckley. When it was over the Firestorm had completely destroyed six towns, and over lay black and smoldering. The firestorm was so devastating that it lasted only four hours but destroyed everything in its path."
"The fire destroyed the town of Hinckley (which at the time had a population of over 1,400) as well as the smaller nearby settlements of Mission Creek, Brook Park, Sandstone, Miller, Partridge and Pokegama."
The exact number of fatalities is difficult to determine. The official coroner's report counted 413 dead while the fire's official monument notes 418. An unknown number of Native Americans and backcountry dwellers were also killed in the fire; bodies continued to be found years later. Along with the 1918 Cloquet Fire (where 453 were killed) it is one of the deadliest in Minnesota history.
"Today, a section of the Willard Munger State Trail, from Hinckley to Barnum, is a memorial to the fire and the devastation it caused. In the town of Hinckley, on Highway 61, the Hinckley Fire Museum is located in the former Northern Pacific Railway depot. It is located a few feet north of the former depot, which burned down in the fire. It is open from May 1 until the end of October."
Lutheran Memorial Cemetery in Hinckley has a historical marker and granite obelisk as a memorial to those who perished in the fire. 248 residents of Hinckley perished in the fire and are buried in a mass grave at this cemetery. Some are unidentified.
"The Brook Park Cemetery on County Road 126, south of Minnesota State Highway 23, has an historical marker plaque and a memorial to the 23 fire victims of Brook Park, with a tall obelisk on top of a granite marker."
"Thomas P. ""Boston"" Corbett, the Union soldier who killed John Wilkes Booth after Booth's assassination of Abraham Lincoln, is presumed to have died in the fire. His last known residence is believed to have been a forest settlement near Hinckley, and a ""Thomas Corbett"" is listed as one of the dead or missing. Thomas P. ""Boston"" Corbett may not have died in the fire. Thomas Gilbert Corbitt lived in the Town of Thurston, in Steuben County, NY. He was a Civil War veteran in the 50th NY Engineers, Co. E. In late September and early October of 1894, Steuben County newspapers reported that Thomas Corbitt, until recently a resident of Thurston, was burned to death, along with his property, in the great fire at Hinckley, Minn."

The film script's initial premise centered on a young boy that created special monster trucks in order to eliminate drunk drivers."
"The five drunken sons of influential local business owner Tiny Doyle have been terrorizing the streets of their small town in their pick-up truck. Local trucker Big Joe Rosso has a wife named Kathy, a son named Joey, and two young daughters named Allison and Kristin. Big Joe and Joey do business with Tiny, delivering liquor to his bar, but that doesn't stop Tiny's son Vic from driving drunk and running Kathy off the road, killing Kathy, Allison, and Kristin. Thanks to Tiny's influence, the local judge sets Vic free after ordering Vic to pay a $300 fine. Lieutenant Sly, one of the local cops, is sympathetic toward the Rosso family, but Sly is about to retire, and Tiny has a lot of clout in this town. Enraged and bereaved, Big Joe goes after Vic, but the Doyles kill Big Joe. After that, they rape Joey's girlfriend Misty.

"My Worst Nightmare (original title: Mon pire cauchemar) is a 2011 French-Belgian comedy-drama film written and directed by Anne Fontaine, starring Isabelle Huppert, Benoît Poelvoorde and André Dussollier."
"Agathe is a successful art dealer who lives with her husband François and their son Adrien in a wealthy quarter of Paris. Adrien is an underachiever at his school and Agathe fights any disadvantages that this can bring for him in parent-teacher conferences. François is more of a reserved person and procrastinates on a construction project. The situation gets stirred up when Adrien's friend Patrick, who is Tony's father, enters the picture. Tony is brilliant in his studies irrespective of his poor access to amenities, so Agathe has a soft spot for the child. And, Adrien's test results seem to be getting better. But Patrick has a rather dubious social background. He lacks both tact in social situations and a proper home or job for supporting a family. Agathe is distressed by Patrick's unpolished behavior and his intrusion into their life. Her husband François hires him to take care of the overdue construction project and they become friends. Then François cajoles a woman Patrick had wanted for himself and leaves Agathe. Patrick and Agathe are left back with the children. Agathe develops a sense of attachment for this unruly man who, ""au contraire"" to her husband, empathizes with her and is dedicated to ensuring his son can attend a respected school. But Patrick fails continuously to become responsible and they break up. Some time later they reconnect because each seems to complete the other."
"""My worst nightmare"" was evaluated as an ""utterly conventional French bourgeois comedy"". Still it was also considered ""watchable"" just because of its cast."
"Isabelle Huppert was in particular praised for making Agathe's transformation believable. Benoît Poelvoorde's performance was recognised a ""often irritable and hilarious"".

The building, which has fallen into disrepair, became a municipal landmark in 2013."
"Erected in 1870, the Gothic Revival-influenced building was designed by John Remson Onderdonk, a local architect and practitioner of the ecclesiological philosophy, and is considered to be a masterpiece of 19th-century ecclesiastical architecture by the city's landmarks conservancy. Its façade replicates a portion of the Chartres Cathedral in Southern France. Once housing the largest Episcopal church congregation in New Jersey, among its members were many of the leading citizens of Jersey City. It was called the ""Millionaire's Church"". In 1914, much of the church was damaged by fire, but was elaborately restored. By the mid-twentieth century, reflecting the demographic change in the city, its congregation became more working class. From 1960 to 1968 the church was a center of the civil rights and anti-Vietnam war movements during the rectorship of the Reverend Robert W. Castle who preached a social gospel and drew attention to the plight of the city's poor. The church has not housed an Episcopal congregation since 1994."

In 2008, the SHPO issued a certificate of eligibility (ID#4986) for listing individually on both the New Jersey Register of Historic Places and the National Register of Historic Places. Attempts made in 2007/2008 to have the church designated a local landmark were unsuccessful, the motion having been tabled by the Jersey City City Council. When it appeared that the diocese was moving to demolish the building, a campaign was begun to convince the city council to re-visit the issue which it did in June 2013 and adopted a measure granting landmark status."
St. John's has not been in regular use since 1994. In 2004 Preservation New Jersey named St. John's one of the most endangered historic sites in the state.
"There is concern that if the building continues to deteriorate it will be necessary for it is to be demolished. The Jersey Landmarks Conservancy, a preservation group, believes that the Episcopal Diocese of Newark has intentionally neglected the building in order to demolish it. The stained glass windows, altar, and other items were removed in 1997. In January 2012, the church's altar was offered for sale on e-bay. The diocese maintains that the preservation of the building is too costly and that no serious offers to purchase it have been forthcoming. In March 2013 the City of Jersey City served the diocese a Notice of Unsafe Structure, after which it contracted an asbestos abatement work and applied for a permit for demolition. Its designation as a local landmark requires that special approval be given before the building can be razed. The diocese disagrees with the landmarking. In 2015 it was decided to convert the property to residental spaces, including consruction of new buildings and conversion of the church."

"The Kings Island & Miami Valley Railroad is a narrow gauge passenger railroad located at the Kings Island Amusement Park in Mason, Ohio. The line is a 5,282-foot (1,610 m) loop. The line has two stations: the Losantiville station (the main station) also commonly referred to as ""Rivertown Station"" and a station at Soak City. It is a part of the rides department, and has a thrill rating of ""1 - Low Thrill Ride"". The entire journey lasts between 9 and 15 minutes, depending on station stops and number of trains in operation. The Kings Island & Miami Valley Railroad is one of the oldest and consistently popular attractions at Kings Island. It is currently"
The Kings Island & Miami Valley Railroad maintains two working locomotives. They were built by Crown Metal Products of Pennsylvania for the park opening in 1972 and were modeled after The General.
"The #12 engine, also known as the ""Kenny Van Meter"", features a propane-fired boiler and has a total weight of 25 tons (engine and tender). It is a 2/3 scale replica of The General. It is painted blue. The locomotive's original name was Tecumseh after the Shawnee leader. Originally, it featured a balloon-style stack but it was replaced in the late 1980s or early 1990s to make it stand apart from the green engine. The blue engine also originally had two blue domes but were painted red to match the wheels in the late 1980s or early 1990s, when the balloon stack was removed."
"The codice_6 attribute does not always have to literally describe the contents of the image. Keep in mind the purpose and context of the image and what would be useful to someone who cannot see it. The alt attribute is supposed to be an ""alternative"" for the image, usually stating its purpose. For example, an image of a warning sign should not have alt text “a triangle with a yellow background, black border and an exclamation mark”, but simply “Warning!”—unless, of course, the image's purpose is to show what the warning symbol actually looks like."
"Internet Explorer 7 and earlier render text in alt attributes as tooltip text, which is not standards-compliant. This behavior led many web developers to misuse alt when they wished to display tooltips containing additional information about images, instead of using the codice_7 attribute that was intended for that use. As of Internet Explorer 8 alt attributes no longer render as tooltips."
"The alt attribute is commonly, but incorrectly, referred to as the ""alt tag""."
"The W3C recommends that images that convey no information, but are purely decorative, be specified in CSS rather than in the HTML markup. However, it may sometimes be necessary to include a decorative image as an HTML codice_2 tag. In this case, if the image truly does not add to the content, then a blank alt attribute should be included in the form of codice_9. This makes the page navigable for users of screen readers or non-graphical browsers. If (in breach of the standard) no alt attribute has been supplied, then browsers that cannot display the image will still display something there, e.g. the URL of the image, or a fixed text string."
= = = The Runaway in Oz = = =
"The Runaway in Oz is an Oz book by long-time Oz illustrator John R. Neill. It was written originally during 1943 and was meant to be the thirty-seventh book in the Oz series. However, Neill died before he could edit or illustrate the book. Oz publisher Reilly & Lee decided not to publish the book due to shortages caused by World War II. The text remained a possession of Neill's family."
"In 1995, the book was published by Oz specialty house Books of Wonder with illustrations by Eric Shanower. Shanower also edited and expanded Neill's text. Another version exists, printed privately, with different editing by Fred M. Meyer, longtime Secretary of The International Wizard of Oz Club."
"On the eve of an important ceremony in the Emerald City, Scraps the Patchwork Girl has been making more of a nuisance of herself than usual. After confrontations with Jellia Jamb and Jenny Jump, Scraps decides to run away on her spoolicle (a bicycle made of thread spools). She visits Jinjur's Munchkin Country farm; but Jinjur wants to put Scraps to work, so Scraps leaves quickly."
"At Prof. Wogglebug's Royal Athletic College, Scraps falls in with a 12-year-old prodigy named Alexample. They marvel at the air castle the Professor has dreamed into existence for his coming vacation, as it hovers above the college. Through unfortunate clumsiness, Scraps knocks the mooring line loose and the air castle floats away, with Alexample hanging onto the tethering rope. Scraps flees from the pursuit of the irate Wogglebug."
"Scraps meets a Repairman who magically fixes the damage and staining she's endured in her recent actions. The exasperated Scraps longs to run away from Oz entirely, but doesn't know how to cross the Deadly Desert. The Repairman informs her of a Weather Witch who lives on the highest mountain in Oz; she makes weather for the entire Earth from her windmill there. Scraps decides to get the Weather Witch to blow her across the Desert with wind, and sets out for the mountain."
"On the way, Scraps meets Popla, ""the one and only power plant...the most powerful plant in the world."" (Popla looks like a large shrub, with the face of a beautiful young woman.) Popla longs for release from her bleak and stationary existence, and eagerly transfers herself into a flowerpot to join with Scraps; Popla's strength and resourcefulness prove to be important advantages in their coming adventures. Despite tempestuous winds, the two intrepid travelers reach the top of the mountain. Fanny the Weather Witch agrees to blast them across the Deadly Desert; but additional clumsiness gets them stuck on one of the windmill's blades, which hurls them high into the atmosphere."
"Meanwhile, Prof. Wogglebug stomps toward the Emerald City to complain about Scraps to the Wizard. He encounters Jenny Jump and Jack Pumpkinhead, who have set out in search for the missing Scraps. The Wogglebug decides to join up with them, as the most direct approach to recovering his air castle. (The later chapters of the book alternate between the two plots: the runaway Scraps and her companions, and the searchers pursuing her.)"
"Scraps and Popla land on a friendly cloud, who takes them to a nearby star. The star is a kind of semi-mechanical conveyance, commanded by Captain Batt, who is built of wires and electric components. Predictably, Scraps gets into a fight with him; she punches him in his button nose, which proves to be his on-off button. With Captain Batt shut down, they meet the Twinkler, the star's maintenance man (he looks like Cap'n Bill). Popla tries piloting the star — and crashes into the missing air castle. They find Alexample there, and endure a few peaceful days in its palatial environs. They get to know the inhabitants of the upper air, who include sky fairies and air sprites, and cloud sheep herded by cloud-pushers and sky-sweepers. Scraps and company also repel an attack from sky pirates."
"Things go badly for the searchers below; they are caught in a storm, in which Jack loses his pumpkin head. Jenny and the Professor have to lead or drag his headless stick-body along with them. They wander into an enchanted orchard, where they confront an army of rebellious quinces. By this time, the week of the Wogglebug's planned vacation has expired, and the air castle's time is up: it melts, cracks, dissolves, shatters, and otherwise falls apart around its occupants. They come tumbling down upon the enchanted orchard, and the search party, and the quince army. In a final confrontation, the quince soldiers commit mass suicide by shooting their sooty stems at Scraps. She is so blackened by the soot that she tries to hide from the world."
"The others convince Scraps to return to the Emerald City, where she can be magically repaired. Scraps agrees, but she hides herself under a sheet as she walks through the city streets (like Ojo in ""The Patchwork Girl of Oz""); she causes a panic when she is mistaken for a ghost. Yet Ozma has no trouble in restoring Scraps to normal (if that term applies) with her Magic Belt. Popla and Alexample are welcomed into the ever-growing circle of Ozma's followers."
"In the best Baum tradition, puns come thick and fast throughout ""The Runaway in Oz"". In Chapter 8, ""The Professor Sets Out,"" the reader is informed of the enlarged bug's feelings: ""But though he was in an unsettled state of mind, he was not crushed."" Two pages later, he threatens to become ""hopping mad."" Jenny tells the professor that the Wizard is busy ""ridding the country of dumb little kings and their little kingdumbs."" These three pages can stand as representative of the whole."
= = = Hōjō Ujitsuna = = =
"In 1524, Ujitsuna took Edo Castle, which was controlled by Uesugi Tomooki, thus beginning a long-running rivalry between the Hōjō and Uesugi families. Two years later, the Uesugi attacked and burned Kamakura, which was a major loss to the Hōjō symbolically, because the earlier Hōjō clan from which they took their name fell in the siege of Kamakura in 1333."
"The Uesugi attacked again in 1535, when Ujitsuna was away fighting the Takeda; however, Ujitsuna returned and defeated Uesugi Tomooki, reclaiming his lands. When Uesugi Tomooki died two years later, Ujitsuna took the opportunity to seize Kawagoe Castle, and secure his control of the Kantō."
"In 1526, Hojo Ujitsuna was defeated by Takeda Nobutora in the Battle of Nashinokidaira."
"Ujitsuna then went on to win the battle of Kōnodai in 1538, securing Shimōsa Province for the Hōjō."
In 1539 he defeated the Koga Kubo Yoshiaki and gained control of Awa.
"Over the next several years before his death in 1541, Ujitsuna oversaw the rebuilding of Kamakura, making it a symbol of the growing power of the Hōjō, along with Odawara and Edo. He was succeeded as head of the Hōjō clan and lord of Odawara by his son Hōjō Ujiyasu."

"Andromeda Attumasen is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is an Atlantean of Marvel's shared universe, known as the Marvel Universe. She is the illegitimate daughter of Attuma"
"Andromeda was introduced in ""The Defenders"" #143 (March 1985) and added to the titular supergroup's lineup just a few issues later. Writer Peter B. Gillis later revealed, ""My long-term plan was to populate the Defenders with my own crew of characters, characters who nonetheless had ties to interesting parts of the Marvel Universe. Andromeda, while not the Sub-Mariner, gave me a connection to Atlantis."" However, Andromeda would be the last character Gillis added to the Defenders, since shortly after her debut he was told that the series was being cancelled."
