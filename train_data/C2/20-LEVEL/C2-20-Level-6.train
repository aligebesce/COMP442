Why am I
difficult.
missing  missing some subtle point here.
"Are we leaving the washing machine, by the way?"
No!
"Well that absolutely, we've gotta get a new washing machine!"
Don't be stupid!
"We have, look, this one!"
It's only because it's not so not erm  stable.
Just adjust the feet  slightly.
"If I had it on a solid floor, but it's gotta go, don't forget it's on a  a wooden floor."
Oh I suppose so.
"What you want is a so so , is a solid floor."
Is it?
Mhm.
Oh right.
"Well that makes a difference, solid floor."
Oh oh!
"Will you stand it, sort of the garage in your er  best job of the afternoon?"
Won't be too bad.
"Well this, well I think it's a Hotpoint."

I've been thirsty all evening!
hours.
Mhm.
Right?
And they said you did point one mile in point O O one hours
Hours.
so what speed is that?
Er
Have a guess at it then check it on your calculator.
Point   one divided by point zero one .
Will the two first  cancel out?
Do they?
No.
"If I gave you this  tenth, hundredth, thousandth okay?"
What would you do?
Run.
that's hours.
Are those?
That one and that one cancel.
It would cancel out.
So you've got one over one hundredth.
"So that's a bit tricky that, doing it that way, you've got one over one hundredth ."
"The, the easy way, do you like fractions on the bottom of fractions?"
No.
"Oh, times by  ah."
What are you going to times it by?
Times that by ten over one.
"No, times that by a thousand over one."
Times that by a thousand.
"Okay, and you've done, you've done that on one bit of the fraction, so you must do it on the top as well."
Times that by a thou aargh.
You've got to times that by a thousand.
Okay?
Pardon?
Did he keep ferrets.
Yes.
Oh I was afra
To catch them with.

Three point nought one.
Right.
Right?
And in between would be three.
Between would be three.
"Up one  that, we'll just take ."
What will Y be when X is that?
Erm two point nine nine squared minus one.
Okay.
"So you'd just write it as, I mean as it's minus one, you can take it off as you go along, but it's, sometimes it'll be a minus six or something, so write it as two point nine nine squared minus one."
Erm  three  squared minus one.
Okay.
Now subtract
when you have to
that Y from that one.
Okay.
It's two point nine nine plus three point
Mm.
"Oh  Oh, yeah, don't, don't do it all in your head."
Okay.
Do the first stage first.
"Take that expression away from that, and once you're left, what happens to the minus ones?"
They cancel.
Right.
So what are you left with?
In terms of the squares.
Two point nine nine and three point
Which one's first?
Two point nine nine..

And that's why Mr  said he  he'd er
"He'd do it, yeah."
And we know where we are then with the toilet.
"You know, you know what you're getting don't you?"
Yeah.
How much ?
Yeah it'd be erm  Jim  said there would be no problem because his men have to empty their own chemical loos anyway.
But the bowl coupling could be a problem.
"He said but we'll sort it out, don't worry love."
They're all very nice   people.
They have got an accent  this  's got one  but he sounds more Lancashire than anything.
And he's nowhere near.
Perhaps he's just moved there.
Mm.
I'll have to er  give her a ring to   and tell them to send me the advert.
Tell them to buy .
Mhm.
When does it go out?
I don't know.
Today.

"He said well you know I, I iron mostly, most of the ironing, I said yeah I know you do."
Whatever does she do then?
"Well   well he said  when he's not there she comes home  she cooks them an evening meal  but she's she she's  she's got a p , he said she's gotta give some time to Harriet, that's not fair"
Yeah.
"if she don't, I said well that's true  I said you can't  and we're not gonna neglect, which they don't."
Yeah.
And then he said er  by the time she's  sorted out  and washed up
Yeah.
"and I thought, she don't wash up, she"
Yeah.

Yeah.
"Erm  it's tha then getting towards  and she's gone down and done the horses he sh he said it's then getting to Harriet's bed time so she baths her all  sorts her out  and he said  well she does work hard, he said and by the end of that she  she won't be able to do anything else!"
No .
Well I said I can understand that
Pardon?
"I   I said well I suppose it's  I do  and he said but you work hard June, I said I know but  I said kno I said what I do, I can only have hour out there and an hour inside."
Yeah.
"And I said I can sort of keep on top of mine, but I said  I am up early."
Yeah.
He said well Trish isn't.
I said well I get up early.
Mm.
If I'm doing like my jobs.
Yeah.
"I said I'm, most morning I said  sort of every other morning I'm ironing here at half five"
Yeah.
I said because if I don't I can't pick up all this.
Yeah.
"Cor he said, I wouldn't wanna iron that time of the morning!"
Oh yeah.
I loved it yeah.
Well when you go on holiday swimming.
Everyone was upstairs rolling up their hair
Yes.
and .
"And you could swim, just dry it and then just pull it back."
big scarf and you were made weren't you?
Yes.
That's right.
Yeah.
That's right.
Yeah it was very useful.
Yeah.
Right.
Right.
We will go round this way or round that way?
Cor look at that bas oh no it's fine
She ain't got that problem yet.
You wait till
No.
She's probably saying oh this is so boring this conversation but when she gets to our age that'll be the same.
Well  well she'll just she'll just go silver.
She was silver when she was little so  I suppose she'll go back to silver.
Anything else you want to look at Dinda?
No I don't think so.
It's probably about quarter to
Yes I expect it probably is.
Hello love.
We'll grab this casserole because  erm
Hopefully I won't
what's her name wasn't sure if you'd get any more in of the next size up so
What's that?
I have never been in there.
You was.
"Me and, you and I was in there on  don't know when, years ago."
Dianne told me the score so  anyway you're like a friend  can go with you.
You're driving.
Ah?
"So in a way, like someone can go with you and all if you want."
Can they?
"Well, look!"
I don't think so Helen.
"I mean, they've dropped that wee girl on her own."
"No, well because I've seen it before."
You think I would do it.
"That wee girl over there, she's riding it."
"They must take two like, you know, that one round the bend there they have bars on."
"Well, well there's arm one you go for, you'll have to."
I don't see how you would learn very much.
No .
"Your first couple of lessons are half an hour take you driving anyway, and by the time you get up there you'd drive onto them."
.
"And, if you haven't been in a car before the driver drives, so you can give me what you owe."
.
Which one's Paul's ?
What?
Ooh!
"Right, we're going in there."
This is good!
Good !
It's Sly.
It is.
Sly?
I mean how often do you use six?
"Well we do, there's five of us in the family see"
Oh I see
Yeah so
we had four kids   I mean now it's only when we get visitors you know when
Yeah.
"there's only two of us, you get two visitors we're alright as a four"
Saying that we don't
"We keep ours in the garage, the extra  two carvers"
Oh yes.
"and they come down when you know, if we've got any"
When you need them.
Mm.
Otherwise it's just a waste really.
Well that's probably what I'm gonna have to do.
"You can get, you can get sets of four can't you?"
Oh yes
But six  hard to get.
I'll just try and get two carvers to match
"Yeah, that's, that's the answer really and er if they're not quite the same you can get away with two carvers can't you?"
"But er  oh well  Yeah this is what got me, I like the er the legs you know, the the backs I, I didn't like at all because you've got this blue"
Well
"You've got no  no m no wood that's showing you see, that's the trouble."
"Yes, yes."
Yeah
"Erm but I'm hoping they'll  put them on a, on the table when we sell them in here and there's  that's the first thing that'll hit them is the turned legs you see?"
Nice.
This is a su survey.
finished at one point but it's veneered
Mm
But erm
"this, but this was exposed then?"
So you got .
"Oh no you do , you  no, no!"
Well yes.
"Well  no, no, no."
You play    four on the team  the four on the team play a go right?
"Then, whichever played a one  that game  go away again."
Yeah.
So you've got the same ?
!
"Yes, alright then."
"Then you play, you play yo you play four singles  four singles, four singles and two doubles."
I was thinking you played .
"I mean they go away, I mean  the six always played at the back."
but everybody else is.
"Brian was saying, he said  you going in with your   he said and we'll lose that , he said he should play his best bloody"
Well yeah.
six you've got!
But darts don't work like that .
If you're going to win you gotta play you're best six .
That's right.
That's right.
"You've got to, but  then again, you know"
Unless you're not bothered.
"Unless, unless, unless, unless you won and then you get best ."
"Well no, you ge if you won and give the rest a game."
See we're not bothered.
"We're, we're, I mean we're not  we're not that bothered  really  ."
"Yeah, but no  could we?"
I mean
"Well we could, we could help you"
"I mean we want, we want  well, to tell you truth, we shall won on that, we won on that occasion."
"I put on, I put on my best two doubles haven't I?"
Miss Susan deigned no reply .
Old John strode out to the turnip field .
"Burton saw him coming and looked for another outburst of wrath , but his father 's first words almost took away his breath ."
"`` See here , Burt , I take back all I said this afternoon ."
"I want you to marry Madge Oliver now , and the sooner , the better ."
That old cat of a Susan had the face to come up and tell me you were n't good enough for her niece .
I told her a few plain truths .
Do n't you mind the old crosspatch .
I 'll back you up . ''
"By this time Burton had begun hoeing vigorously , to hide the amused twinkle of comprehension in his eyes ."
"He admired Miss Susan 's tactics , but he did not say so ."
"`` All right , Father , '' he answered dutifully ."
"When Miss Susan reached home she told Madge to bathe her eyes and put on her new pink muslin , because she guessed Burton would be down that evening ."
"`` Oh , Auntie , how did you manage it ? ''"
cried Madge .
"`` Madge , '' said Miss Susan solemnly , but with dancing eyes , `` do you know how to drive a pig ?"
Just try to make it go in the opposite direction and it will bolt the way you want it .
"Remember that , my dear . ''"
Fair Exchange and No Robbery Katherine Rangely was packing up .
"Her chum and roommate , Edith Wilmer , was sitting on the bed watching her in that calm disinterested fashion peculiarly maddening to a bewildered packer ."
"`` It does seem too provoking , '' said Katherine , as she tugged at an obstinate shawl strap , `` that Ned should be transferred here now , just when I 'm going away ."
The powers that be might have waited until vacation was over .
Ned wo n't know a soul here and he 'll be horribly lonesome . ''
"`` I 'll do my best to befriend him , with your permission , '' said Edith consolingly ."
"`` Oh , I know ."
"You 're a special Providence , Ede ."
"Ned will be up tonight first thing , of course , and I 'll introduce him ."
Try to keep the poor fellow amused until I get back .
Two months !
Just fancy !
And Aunt Elizabeth wo n't abate one jot or tittle of the time I promised to stay with her .
"Harbour Hill is so frightfully dull , too . ''"
"Marilla promised ; but the promise was quite unnecessary , for Mrs. Lynde was no sooner fairly seated than she said , `` I saw Mr. Harrison chasing your Jersey out of his oats today when I was coming home from Carmody ."
I thought he looked pretty mad .
Did he make much of a rumpus ? ''
Anne and Marilla furtively exchanged amused smiles .
Few things in Avonlea ever escaped Mrs. Lynde .
"It was only that morning Anne had said , `` If you went to your own room at midnight , locked the door , pulled down the blind , and SNEEZED , Mrs. Lynde would ask you the next day how your cold was ! ''"
"`` I believe he did , '' admitted Marilla ."
`` I was away .
He gave Anne a piece of his mind . ''
"`` I think he is a very disagreeable man , '' said Anne , with a resentful toss of her ruddy head ."
"`` You never said a truer word , '' said Mrs. Rachel solemnly ."
"`` I knew there 'd be trouble when Robert Bell sold his place to a New Brunswick man , that 's what ."
"I do n't know what Avonlea is coming to , with so many strange people rushing into it ."
It 'll soon not be safe to go to sleep in our beds . ''
"`` Why , what other strangers are coming in ? ''"
asked Marilla .
`` Have n't you heard ?
"Well , there 's a family of Donnells , for one thing ."
They 've rented Peter Sloane 's old house .
Peter has hired the man to run his mill .
They belong down east and nobody knows anything about them .
Then that shiftless Timothy Cotton family are going to move up from White Sands and they 'll simply be a burden on the public .
He is in consumption ... when he is n't stealing ... and his wife is a slack-twisted creature that ca n't turn her hand to a thing .
She washes her dishes SITTING DOWN .
"Mrs. George Pye has taken her husband 's orphan nephew , Anthony Pye ."
"He 'll be going to school to you , Anne , so you may expect trouble , that 's what ."
"And you 'll have another strange pupil , too ."
Paul Irving is coming from the States to live with his grandmother .
"You remember his father , Marilla ... Stephen Irving , him that jilted Lavendar Lewis over at Grafton ? ''"
`` I do n't think he jilted her .
There was a quarrel ... I suppose there was blame on both sides . ''
"`` Well , anyway , he did n't marry her , and she 's been as queer as possible ever since , they say ... living all by herself in that little stone house she calls Echo Lodge ."
I ca n't begin to tell you how unhappy I am .
"Truly , my heart is breaking . ''"
Rilla sat down on the lounge beside her .
"Sir Wilfrid squatted on his haunches before them , with his impertinent pink tongue stuck out , and listened ."
"`` What is the trouble , Miranda ? ''"
`` Joe is coming home tonight on his last leave .
"I had a letter from him on Saturday -- he sends my letters in care of Bob Crawford , you know , because of father -- and , oh , Rilla , he will only have four days -- he has to go away Friday morning -- and I may never see him again . ''"
`` Does he still want you to marry him ? ''
asked Rilla .
"`` Oh , yes ."
He implored me in his letter to run away and be married .
"But I can not do that , Rilla , not even for Joe ."
My only comfort is that I will be able to see him for a little while tomorrow afternoon .
Father has to go to Charlottetown on business .
At least we will have one good farewell talk .
"But oh -- afterwards -- why , Rilla , I know father wo n't even let me go to the station Friday morning to see Joe off . ''"
`` Why in the world do n't you and Joe get married tomorrow afternoon at home ? ''
demanded Rilla .
Miranda swallowed a sob in such amazement that she almost choked .
"`` Why -- why -- that is impossible , Rilla . ''"
`` Why ? ''
briefly demanded the organizer of the Junior Red Cross and the transporter of babies in soup tureens .
"`` Why -- why -- we never thought of such a thing -- Joe has n't a license -- I have no dress -- I could n't be married in black -- I -- I -- we -- you -- you -- '' Miranda lost herself altogether and Sir Wilfrid , seeing that she was in dire distress threw back his head and emitted a melancholy yelp ."
Rilla Blythe thought hard and rapidly for a few minutes .
"Then she said , `` Miranda , if you will put yourself into my hands I 'll have you married to Joe before four o'clock tomorrow afternoon . ''"
"`` Oh , you could n't . ''"
`` I can and I will .
But you 'll have to do exactly as I tell you . ''
"`` Oh -- I -- do n't think -- oh , father will kill me -- '' `` Nonsense ."
He 'll be very angry I suppose .
But are you more afraid of your father 's anger than you are of Joe 's never coming back to you ? ''
"`` No , '' said Miranda , with sudden firmness , `` I 'm not . ''"
`` Sure thing .
I 'm here for a look-in .
Can I come up to Ingleside tonight and see you ? ''
`` Of courthe . ''
Had he used `` you '' in the singular or plural sense ?
"Presently she would wring Jims ' neck -- oh , what was Ken saying ?"
"`` See here , Rilla , can you arrange that there wo n't be more than a few dozen people round ?"
Understand ?
I ca n't make my meaning clearer over this bally rural line .
There are a dozen receivers down . ''
Did she understand !
"Yes , she understood ."
"`` I 'll try , '' she said ."
`` I 'll be up about eight then .
By-by . ''
Rilla hung up the ` phone and flew to Jims .
But she did not wring that injured infant 's neck .
"Instead she snatched him bodily out of his chair , crushed him against her face , kissed him rapturously on his milky mouth , and danced wildly around the room with him in her arms ."
"After this Jims was relieved to find that she returned to sanity , gave him the rest of his dinner properly , and tucked him away for his afternoon nap with the little lullaby he loved best of all ."
"She sewed at Red Cross shirts for the rest of the afternoon and built a crystal castle of dreams , all a-quiver with rainbows ."
Ken wanted to see her -- to see her alone .
That could be easily managed .
"Shirley would n't bother them , father and mother were going to the Manse , Miss Oliver never played gooseberry , and Jims always slept the clock round from seven to seven ."
"She would entertain Ken on the veranda -- it would be moonlight -- she would wear her white georgette dress and do her hair up -- yes , she would -- at least in a low knot at the nape of her neck ."
"Mother could n't object to that , surely ."
"Oh , how wonderful and romantic it would be !"
Would Ken say anything -- he must mean to say something or why should he be so particular about seeing her alone ?
What if it rained -- Susan had been complaining about Mr. Hyde that morning !
What if some officious Junior Red called to discuss Belgians and shirts ?
"Or , worst of all , what if Fred Arnold dropped in ?"
He did occasionally .
The evening came at last and was all that could be desired in an evening .
"I thought Miss Bat did the sewing , '' said Mr. Bemis , as he smiled at the funny little garment , it looked so like Boo himself ."
"`` No , sir ; only yours ."
I do mine and Boo 's .
"At least , I 'm learning how , and Mrs. Pecq says I get on nicely , '' answered Molly , threading her needle and making a knot in her most capable way ."
"`` I suppose it is time you did learn , for you are getting to be a great girl , and all women should know how to make and mend ."
"You must take a stitch for me now and then : Miss Bat 's eyes are not what they were , I find ; '' and Mr. Bemis looked at his frayed wristband , as if he particularly felt the need of a stitch just then ."
"`` I 'd love to , and I guess I could ."
"I can mend gloves ; Merry taught me , so I 'd better begin on them , if you have any , '' said Molly , much pleased at being able to do anything for her father , and still more so at being asked ."
"`` There 's something to start with ; '' and he threw her a pair , with nearly every finger ripped ."
"Molly shook her head over them , but got out her gray silk and fell to work , glad to show how well she could sew ."
`` What are you smiling about ? ''
"asked her father , after a little pause , for his head felt better , and it amused him to question Molly ."
`` I was thinking about my summer clothes .
"I must get them before long , and I 'd like to go with Mrs. Grant and learn how to shop , if you are willing . ''"
`` I thought Miss Bat did that for you . ''
"`` She always has , but she gets ugly , cheap things that I do n't like ."
"I think I am old enough to choose myself , if there is someone to tell me about prices and the goodness of the stuff ."
Merry does ; and she is only a few months older than I am . ''
"`` How old are you , child ? ''"
"asked her father , feeling as if he had lost his reckoning ."
`` Fifteen in August ; '' and Molly looked very proud of the fact .
`` So you are !
"Bless my heart , how the time goes !"
"Well , get what you please ; if I 'm to have a young lady here , I 'd like to have her prettily dressed ."
"It wo n't offend Miss Bat , will it ? ''"
"Molly 's eyes sparkled , but she gave a little shrug as she answered , `` She wo n't care ."
She never troubles herself about me if I let her alone .
`` Hey ?
what ?
Not trouble herself ?
"If she does n't , who does ? ''"
and Mr. Bemis sat up as if this discovery was more surprising than the other .
The professor stooped and began hunting for his maltreated hat .
"He was a long time finding it , and when he did he went softly to the door ."
"With his hand on the knob , he paused and looked back ."
"`` Good-bye , Miss Rangely , '' he said softly ."
"But Katherine , whose face was buried in the cushions of the lounge , did not hear him and when she looked up he was gone ."
"* * * * * Katharine felt that life was stale , flat and unprofitable when she alighted at Riverton station in the dusk of the next evening ."
She was not expected until a later train and there was no one to meet her .
She walked drearily through the streets to her boarding house and entered her room unannounced .
"Edith , who was lying on the bed , sprang up with a surprised greeting ."
"It was too dark to be sure , but Katherine had an uncomfortable suspicion that her friend had been crying , and her heart quaked guiltily ."
Could Edith have suspected anything ?
"`` Why , we did n't think you 'd be up till the 8:30 train , and Ned and I were going to meet you . ''"
"`` I found I could catch an earlier train , so I took it , '' said Katherine , as she dropped listlessly into a chair ."
`` I am tired to death and I have such a headache .
"I ca n't see anyone tonight , not even Ned . ''"
"`` You poor dear , '' said Edith sympathetically , beginning a search for the cologne ."
`` Lie down on the bed and I 'll bathe your poor head .
Did you have a good time at Harbour Hill ?
And how did you leave Sid ?
Did he say anything about coming up ? ''
"`` Oh , he was quite well , '' said Katherine wearily ."
`` I did n't hear him say if he intended to come up or not .
"There , thanks -- that will do nicely . ''"
"After Edith had gone down , Katherine tossed about restlessly ."
She knew Ned had come and she did not want to see him .
"But , after all , it was only putting off the evil day , and it was treating him rather shabbily ."
She would go down for a minute .
"There were two doors to the parlour , and Katherine went by way of the library one , over which a portiere was hanging ."
Her hand was lifted to draw it back when she heard something that arrested the movement .
A woman was crying in the room beyond .
It was Edith -- and what was she saying ?
"`` Oh , Ned , it is all perfectly dreadful !"
says he .
`` This is nae kind of time of night for decent folk ; and I hae nae trokings * wi ' night-hawks .
What brings ye here ?
I have a blunderbush . ''
* Dealings .
"`` Is that yoursel ' , Mr. Balfour ? ''"
"returned Alan , stepping back and looking up into the darkness ."
`` Have a care of that blunderbuss ; they 're nasty things to burst . ''
`` What brings ye here ?
and whae are ye ? ''
"says my uncle , angrily ."
"`` I have no manner of inclination to rowt out my name to the country-side , '' said Alan ; `` but what brings me here is another story , being more of your affair than mine ; and if ye 're sure it 's what ye would like , I 'll set it to a tune and sing it to you . ''"
`` And what is ` t ? ''
asked my uncle .
"`` David , '' says Alan ."
`` What was that ? ''
"cried my uncle , in a mighty changed voice ."
"`` Shall I give ye the rest of the name , then ? ''"
said Alan .
"There was a pause ; and then , `` I 'm thinking I 'll better let ye in , '' says my uncle , doubtfully ."
"`` I dare say that , '' said Alan ; `` but the point is , Would I go ?"
Now I will tell you what I am thinking .
"I am thinking that it is here upon this doorstep that we must confer upon this business ; and it shall be here or nowhere at all whatever ; for I would have you to understand that I am as stiffnecked as yoursel ' , and a gentleman of better family . ''"
"This change of note disconcerted Ebenezer ; he was a little while digesting it , and then says he , `` Weel , weel , what must be must , '' and shut the window ."
"But it took him a long time to get down-stairs , and a still longer to undo the fastenings , repenting -LRB- I dare say -RRB- and taken with fresh claps of fear at every second step and every bolt and bar ."
"At last , however , we heard the creak of the hinges , and it seems my uncle slipped gingerly out and -LRB- seeing that Alan had stepped back a pace or two -RRB- sate him down on the top doorstep with the blunderbuss ready in his hands ."
"`` And , now '' says he , `` mind I have my blunderbush , and if ye take a step nearer ye 're as good as deid . ''"
"`` And a very civil speech , '' says Alan , `` to be sure . ''"
"`` Na , '' says my uncle , `` but this is no a very chanty kind of a proceeding , and I 'm bound to be prepared ."
"And now that we understand each other , ye 'll can name your business . ''"
"`` Why , '' says Alan , `` you that are a man of so much understanding , will doubtless have perceived that I am a Hieland gentleman ."
"My name has nae business in my story ; but the county of my friends is no very far from the Isle of Mull , of which ye will have heard ."
"I should think you ought to be able to , with that imagination you 're always talking of . ''"
"`` But punishments are so horrid and I like to imagine only pleasant things , '' said Anne , cuddling Davy ."
`` There are so many unpleasant things in the world already that there is no use in imagining any more . ''
"In the end Davy was sent to bed , as usual , there to remain until noon next day ."
"He evidently did some thinking , for when Anne went up to her room a little later she heard him calling her name softly ."
"Going in , she found him sitting up in bed , with his elbows on his knees and his chin propped on his hands ."
"`` Anne , '' he said solemnly , `` is it wrong for everybody to tell whop ... falsehoods ?"
I want to know ? ''
"`` Yes , indeed . ''"
`` Is it wrong for a grown-up person ? ''
`` Yes . ''
"`` Then , '' said Davy decidedly , `` Marilla is bad , for SHE tells them ."
"And she 's worse 'n me , for I did n't know it was wrong but she does . ''"
"`` Davy Keith , Marilla never told a story in her life , '' said Anne indignantly ."
`` She did so .
She told me last Tuesday that something dreadful WOULD happen to me if I did n't say my prayers every night .
"And I have n't said them for over a week , just to see what would happen ... and nothing has , '' concluded Davy in an aggrieved tone ."
"Anne choked back a mad desire to laugh with the conviction that it would be fatal , and then earnestly set about saving Marilla 's reputation ."
"`` Why , Davy Keith , '' she said solemnly , `` something dreadful HAS happened to you this very day . ''"
Davy looked sceptical .
"`` I s ` pose you mean being sent to bed without any supper , '' he said scornfully , `` but THAT is n't dreadful ."
"Course , I do n't like it , but I 've been sent to bed so much since I come here that I 'm getting used to it ."
"And you do n't save anything by making me go without supper either , for I always eat twice as much for breakfast . ''"
`` I do n't mean your being sent to bed .
I mean the fact that you told a falsehood today .
"And , Davy , '' ... Anne leaned over the footboard of the bed and shook her finger impressively at the culprit ... `` for a boy to tell what is n't true is almost the worst thing that could HAPPEN to him ... almost the very worst ."
So you see Marilla told you the truth . ''
"`` But I thought the something bad would be exciting , '' protested Davy in an injured tone ."
`` Marilla is n't to blame for what you thought .
Bad things are n't always exciting .
They 're very often just nasty and stupid . ''
"`` It was awful funny to see Marilla and you looking down the well , though , '' said Davy , hugging his knees ."
"Let 's hear it , '' said Carol ."
"`` Let 's write letters -- rainy-day letters -- to everyone in the house , '' said Cyrilla ."
"`` You may depend all the rest of the folks under Mrs. Plunkett 's hospitable roof are feeling more or less blue and lonely too , as well as ourselves ."
"Let 's write them the jolliest , nicest letters we can compose and get Nora Jane to take them to their rooms ."
"There 's that pale little sewing girl , I do n't believe she ever gets letters from anybody , and Miss Marshall , I 'm sure she does n't , and poor old Mrs. Johnson , whose only son died last month , and the new music teacher who came yesterday , a letter of welcome to her -- and old Mr. Grant , yes , and Mrs. Plunkett too , thanking her for all her kindness to us ."
You knew she has been awfully nice to us in spite of the oil stove ukase .
That 's six -- two apiece .
"Let 's do it , girls . ''"
Cyrilla 's sudden enthusiasm for her plan infected the others .
"`` It 's a nice idea , '' said Mary , brightening up ."
`` But who 's to write to whom ?
I 'm willing to take anybody but Miss Marshall .
I could n't write a line to her to save my life .
"She 'd be horrified at anything funny or jokey and our letters will have to be mainly nonsense -- nonsense of the best brand , to be sure , but still nonsense . ''"
"`` Better leave Miss Marshall out , '' suggested Carol ."
`` You know she disapproves of us anyhow .
"She 'd probably resent a letter of the sort , thinking we were trying to play some kind of joke on her . ''"
"`` It would never do to leave her out , '' said Cyrilla decisively ."
"`` Of course , she 's a bit queer and unamiable , but , girls , think of thirty years of boarding-house life , even with the best of Plunketts ."
Would n't that sour anybody ?
You know it would .
"You 'd be cranky and grumbly and disagreeable too , I dare say ."
I 'm really sorry for Miss Marshall .
She 's had a very hard life .
Mrs. Plunkett told me all about her one day .
I do n't think we should mind her biting little speeches and sharp looks .
"And anyway , even if she is really as disagreeable as she sometimes seems to be , why , it must make it all the harder for her , do n't you think ?"
So she needs a letter most of all .
"I 'll write to her , since it 's my suggestion ."
We 'll draw lots for the others . ''
"Besides Miss Marshall , the new music teacher fell to Cyrilla 's share ."
"Mary drew Mrs. Plunkett and the dressmaker , and Carol drew Mrs. Johnson and old Mr. Grant ."
"`` Ay , they hate Sir Daniel , and they hate every man that serves with him , '' said Appleyard ; `` and in the first order of hating , they hate Bennet Hatch and old Nicholas the bowman ."
"See ye here : if there was a stout fellow yonder in the wood-edge , and you and I stood fair for him -- as , by Saint George , we stand !"
"-- which , think ye , would he choose ? ''"
"`` You , for a good wager , '' answered Hatch ."
"`` My surcoat to a leather belt , it would be you ! ''"
cried the old archer .
"`` Ye burned Grimstone , Bennet -- they 'll ne'er forgive you that , my master ."
"And as for me , I 'll soon be in a good place , God grant , and out of bow-shoot -- ay , and cannon-shoot -- of all their malices ."
"I am an old man , and draw fast to homeward , where the bed is ready ."
"But for you , Bennet , y ' are to remain behind here at your own peril , and if ye come to my years unhanged , the old true-blue English spirit will be dead . ''"
"`` Y ' are the shrewishest old dolt in Tunstall Forest , '' returned Hatch , visibly ruffled by these threats ."
"`` Get ye to your arms before Sir Oliver come , and leave prating for one good while ."
"An ye had talked so much with Harry the Fift , his ears would ha ' been richer than his pocket . ''"
"An arrow sang in the air , like a huge hornet ; it struck old Appleyard between the shoulder-blades , and pierced him clean through , and he fell forward on his face among the cabbages ."
"Hatch , with a broken cry , leapt into the air ; then , stooping double , he ran for the cover of the house ."
"And in the meanwhile Dick Shelton had dropped behind a lilac , and had his crossbow bent and shouldered , covering the point of the forest ."
Not a leaf stirred .
The sheep were patiently browsing ; the birds had settled .
"But there lay the old man , with a cloth-yard arrow standing in his back ; and there were Hatch holding to the gable , and Dick crouching and ready behind the lilac bush ."
`` D'ye see aught ? ''
cried Hatch .
"`` Not a twig stirs , '' said Dick ."
"`` I think shame to leave him lying , '' said Bennet , coming forward once more with hesitating steps and a very pale countenance ."
"`` Keep a good eye on the wood , Master Shelton -- keep a clear eye on the wood ."
The saints assoil us !
here was a good shoot ! ''
Bennet raised the old archer on his knee .
"He was not yet dead ; his face worked , and his eyes shut and opened like machinery , and he had a most horrible , ugly look of one in pain ."
"`` Can ye hear , old Nick ? ''"
asked Hatch .
"`` Have ye a last wish before ye wend , old brother ? ''"
"`` Pluck out the shaft , and let me pass , a ' Mary 's name ! ''"
"Some of them quite costly , too ; that is , they will cost me something , but I know I 'll be better off and richer after I 've paid the price ."
"That is what Mr. Grierson would call a paradox , is n't it ?"
I 'll explain all about it to you on Christmas Day . ''
"On Christmas Day , Clorinda went over to Aunt Emmy 's ."
"It was a faded brown Christmas after all , for the snow had not come ."
But Clorinda did not mind ; there was such joy in her heart that she thought it the most delightful Christmas Day that ever dawned .
She put the queer cornery armful she carried down on the kitchen floor before she went into the sitting room .
"Aunt Emmy was lying on the sofa before the fire , and Clorinda sat down beside her ."
"`` I 've come to tell you all about it , '' she said ."
Aunt Emmy patted the hand that was in her own .
"`` From your face , dear girl , it will be pleasant hearing and telling , '' she said ."
Clorinda nodded .
"`` Aunt Emmy , I thought for days over your meaning ... thought until I was dizzy ."
"And then one evening it just came to me , without any thinking at all , and I knew that I could give some gifts after all ."
I thought of something new every day for a week .
"At first I did n't think I could give some of them , and then I thought how selfish I was ."
"I would have been willing to pay any amount of money for gifts if I had had it , but I was n't willing to pay what I had ."
"I got over that , though , Aunt Emmy ."
Now I 'm going to tell you what I did give .
"`` First , there was my teacher , Miss Mitchell ."
I gave her one of father 's books .
"I have so many of his , you know , so that I would n't miss one ; but still it was one I loved very much , and so I felt that that love made it worth while ."
"That is , I felt that on second thought ."
"At first , Aunt Emmy , I thought I would be ashamed to offer Miss Mitchell a shabby old book , worn with much reading and all marked over with father 's notes and pencillings ."
I was afraid she would think it queer of me to give her such a present .
And yet somehow it seemed to me that it was better than something brand new and unmellowed -- that old book which father had loved and which I loved .
"So I gave it to her , and she understood ."
"I think it pleased her so much , the real meaning in it ."
She said it was like being given something out of another 's heart and life .
"`` Then you know Mrs. Martin ... last year she was Miss Hope , my dear Sunday School teacher ."
"She married a home missionary , and they are in a lonely part of the west ."
"Well , I wrote her a letter ."
"cried I. `` Rum , '' he repeated ."
`` I must get away from here .
Rum !
Rum ! ''
"I ran to fetch it , but I was quite unsteadied by all that had fallen out , and I broke one glass and fouled the tap , and while I was still getting in my own way , I heard a loud fall in the parlour , and running in , beheld the captain lying full length upon the floor ."
"At the same instant my mother , alarmed by the cries and fighting , came running downstairs to help me ."
Between us we raised his head .
"He was breathing very loud and hard , but his eyes were closed and his face a horrible colour ."
"`` Dear , deary me , '' cried my mother , `` what a disgrace upon the house !"
And your poor father sick ! ''
"In the meantime , we had no idea what to do to help the captain , nor any other thought but that he had got his death-hurt in the scuffle with the stranger ."
"I got the rum , to be sure , and tried to put it down his throat , but his teeth were tightly shut and his jaws as strong as iron ."
"It was a happy relief for us when the door opened and Doctor Livesey came in , on his visit to my father ."
"`` Oh , doctor , '' we cried , `` what shall we do ?"
Where is he wounded ? ''
`` Wounded ?
A fiddle-stick 's end ! ''
said the doctor .
`` No more wounded than you or I .
"The man has had a stroke , as I warned him ."
"Now , Mrs. Hawkins , just you run upstairs to your husband and tell him , if possible , nothing about it ."
"For my part , I must do my best to save this fellow 's trebly worthless life ; Jim , you get me a basin . ''"
"When I got back with the basin , the doctor had already ripped up the captain 's sleeve and exposed his great sinewy arm ."
It was tattooed in several places .
"`` Here 's luck , '' `` A fair wind , '' and `` Billy Bones his fancy , '' were very neatly and clearly executed on the forearm ; and up near the shoulder there was a sketch of a gallows and a man hanging from it -- done , as I thought , with great spirit ."
"`` Prophetic , '' said the doctor , touching this picture with his finger ."
"`` And now , Master Billy Bones , if that be your name , we 'll have a look at the colour of your blood ."
"Jim , '' he said , `` are you afraid of blood ? ''"
"`` No , sir , '' said I. `` Well , then , '' said he , `` you hold the basin '' ; and with that he took his lancet and opened a vein ."
A great deal of blood was taken before the captain opened his eyes and looked mistily about him .
"First he recognized the doctor with an unmistakable frown ; then his glance fell upon me , and he looked relieved ."
"But suddenly his colour changed , and he tried to raise himself , crying , `` Where 's Black Dog ? ''"
`` Never mind .
Please push up my table .
"I must write a letter , and I want you to post it for me to-night , and never say a word till I give you leave . ''"
"`` Oh , now you are going to have secrets and be mysterious , and get into a mess , are you ? ''"
"and Frank looked down at her with a suspicious air , though he was intensely curious to know what she was about ."
`` Go away till I 'm done .
"You will have to see the outside , but you ca n't know the inside till the answer comes ; '' and propping herself up , Jill wrote the following note , with some hesitation at the beginning and end , for she did not know the gentleman she was addressing , except by sight , and it was rather awkward : -- `` Robert Walker ."
"`` Dear Sir , I want to ask if Jack Minot came to see you last Friday afternoon ."
He got into trouble being seen with Jerry Shannon .
He paid him some money .
"Jack wo n't tell , and Mr. Acton talked to him about it before all the school ."
"We feel bad , because we think Jack did not do wrong ."
"I do n't know as you have anything to do with it , but I thought I 'd ask ."
Please answer quick .
"Respectfully yours , `` Jane Pecq '' To make sure that her despatch was not tampered with , Jill put a great splash of red sealing-wax on it , which gave it a very official look , and much impressed Bob when he received it ."
`` There !
"Go and post it , and do n't let any one see or know about it , '' she said , handing it over to Frank , who left his work with unusual alacrity to do her errand ."
"When his eye fell on the address , he laughed , and said in a teasing way , -- `` Are you and Bob such good friends that you correspond ?"
What will Jack say ? ''
"`` Do n't know , and do n't care !"
"Be good , now , and let 's have a little secret as well as other folks ."
"I 'll tell you all about it when he answers , '' said Jill in her most coaxing tone ."
`` Suppose he does n't ? ''
`` Then I shall send you up to see him .
"I must know something , and I want to do it myself , if I can . ''"
`` Look here ; what are you after ?
"I do believe you think -- '' Frank got no farther , for Jill gave a little scream , and stopped him by crying eagerly , `` Do n't say it out loud !"
"I really do believe it may be , and I 'm going to find out . ''"
`` What made you think of him ? ''
"and Frank looked thoughtfully at the letter , as if turning carefully over in his mind the idea that Jill 's quick wits had jumped at ."
`` Come here and I 'll tell you . ''
"Holding him by one button , she whispered something in his ear that made him exclaim , with a look at the rug , -- `` No !"
"`` Why , what can you do ? ''"
asked Madge forlornly .
Miss Susan squared her shoulders and looked amused .
`` You 'll see .
I know old John Ellis better than he knows himself .
He is the most contrary man the Lord ever made .
I went to school with him .
"I learned how to manage him then , and I have n't forgotten how ."
I 'm going straight up to interview him . ''
`` Are you sure that will do any good ? ''
said Madge doubtfully .
"`` If you go to him and take Burton 's and my part , wo n't it only make him worse ? ''"
"`` Madge , dear , '' said Miss Susan , busily twisting her scanty , iron-grey hair up into a hard little knob at the back of her head before Madge 's glass , `` you just wait ."
"I 'm not young , and I 'm not pretty , and I 'm not in love , but I 've more gumption than you and Burton have or ever will have ."
You keep your eyes open and see if you can learn something .
You 'll need it if you go up to live with old John Ellis . ''
"Burton had returned to the turnip field , but old John Ellis was taking his ease with a rampant political newspaper on the cool verandah of his house ."
"Looking up from a bitter editorial to chuckle over a cutting sarcasm contained therein , he saw a tall , angular figure coming up the lane with aggressiveness written large in every fold and flutter of shawl and skirt ."
"`` Old Susan Oliver , as sure as a gun , '' said old John with another chuckle ."
`` She looks mad clean through .
I suppose she 's coming here to blow me up for refusing to let Burton take that girl of hers .
"She 's been angling and scheming for it for years , but she will find who she has to deal with ."
"Come on , Miss Susan . ''"
John Ellis laid down his paper and stood up with a sarcastic smile .
Miss Susan reached the steps and skimmed undauntedly up them .
She did indeed look angry and disturbed .
Without any preliminary greeting she burst out into a tirade that simply took away her complacent foe 's breath .
"`` Look here , John Ellis , I want to know what this means ."
"I 've discovered that that young upstart of a son of yours , who ought to be in short trousers yet , has been courting my niece , Madge Oliver , all summer ."
He has had the impudence to tell me that he wants to marry her .
"I wo n't have it , I tell you , and you can tell your son so ."
Marry my niece indeed !
"She could run faster than Anne , who was hampered by her clinging and drenched skirt , and soon overtook her ."
Behind them they left a trail that would break Mr. Harrison 's heart when he should see it .
"`` Anne , for mercy 's sake , stop , '' panted poor Diana ."
`` I 'm right out of breath and you are wet to the skin . ''
"`` I must ... get ... that cow ... out ... before ... Mr. Harrison ... sees her , '' gasped Anne ."
`` I do n't ... care ... if I 'm ... drowned ... if we ... can ... only ... do that . ''
But the Jersey cow appeared to see no good reason for being hustled out of her luscious browsing ground .
No sooner had the two breathless girls got near her than she turned and bolted squarely for the opposite corner of the field .
"`` Head her off , '' screamed Anne ."
"`` Run , Diana , run . ''"
Diana did run .
"Anne tried to , and the wicked Jersey went around the field as if she were possessed ."
"Privately , Diana thought she was ."
It was fully ten minutes before they headed her off and drove her through the corner gap into the Cuthbert lane .
There is no denying that Anne was in anything but an angelic temper at that precise moment .
"Nor did it soothe her in the least to behold a buggy halted just outside the lane , wherein sat Mr. Shearer of Carmody and his son , both of whom wore a broad smile ."
"`` I guess you 'd better have sold me that cow when I wanted to buy her last week , Anne , '' chuckled Mr. Shearer ."
"`` I 'll sell her to you now , if you want her , '' said her flushed and disheveled owner ."
`` You may have her this very minute . ''
`` Done .
"I 'll give you twenty for her as I offered before , and Jim here can drive her right over to Carmody ."
She 'll go to town with the rest of the shipment this evening .
Mr. Reed of Brighton wants a Jersey cow . ''
"Five minutes later Jim Shearer and the Jersey cow were marching up the road , and impulsive Anne was driving along the Green Gables lane with her twenty dollars ."
`` What will Marilla say ? ''
asked Diana .
"`` Oh , she wo n't care ."
Dolly was my own cow and it is n't likely she 'd bring more than twenty dollars at the auction .
"But oh dear , if Mr. Harrison sees that grain he will know she has been in again , and after my giving him my word of honor that I 'd never let it happen !"
"Well , it has taught me a lesson not to give my word of honor about cows ."
A cow that could jump over or break through our milk-pen fence could n't be trusted anywhere . ''
"Marilla had gone down to Mrs. Lynde 's , and when she returned knew all about Dolly 's sale and transfer , for Mrs. Lynde had seen most of the transaction from her window and guessed the rest ."
`` A bell ! ''
"said Dick , sitting up ."
"`` Can we be , then , so near to Holywood ? ''"
"A little after , the bell clanged again , but this time somewhat nearer hand ; and from that time forth , and still drawing nearer and nearer , it continued to sound brokenly abroad in the silence of the morning ."
"`` Nay , what should this betoken ? ''"
"said Dick , who was now broad awake ."
"`` It is some one walking , '' returned Matcham , and `` the bell tolleth ever as he moves . ''"
"`` I see that well , '' said Dick ."
`` But wherefore ?
What maketh he in Tunstall Woods ?
"Jack , '' he added , `` laugh at me an ye will , but I like not the hollow sound of it . ''"
"`` Nay , '' said Matcham , with a shiver , `` it hath a doleful note ."
"An the day were not come '' -- But just then the bell , quickening its pace , began to ring thick and hurried , and then it gave a single hammering jangle , and was silent for a space ."
"`` It is as though the bearer had run for a pater-noster while , and then leaped the river , '' Dick observed ."
"`` And now beginneth he again to pace soberly forward , '' added Matcham ."
"`` Nay , '' returned Dick -- `` nay , not so soberly , Jack ."
'T is a man that walketh you right speedily .
"'T is a man in some fear of his life , or about some hurried business ."
See ye not how swift the beating draweth near ? ''
"`` It is now close by , '' said Matcham ."
"They were now on the edge of the pit ; and as the pit itself was on a certain eminence , they commanded a view over the greater proportion of the clearing , up to the thick woods that closed it in ."
"The daylight , which was very clear and grey , showed them a riband of white footpath wandering among the gorse ."
"It passed some hundred yards from the pit , and ran the whole length of the clearing , east and west ."
"By the line of its course , Dick judged it should lead more or less directly to the Moat House ."
"Upon this path , stepping forth from the margin of the wood , a white figure now appeared ."
"It paused a little , and seemed to look about ; and then , at a slow pace , and bent almost double , it began to draw near across the heath ."
At every step the bell clanked .
"Face , it had none ; a white hood , not even pierced with eye-holes , veiled the head ; and as the creature moved , it seemed to feel its way with the tapping of a stick ."
"Fear fell upon the lads , as cold as death ."
`` A leper ! ''
"said Dick , hoarsely ."
"`` His touch is death , '' said Matcham ."
* * * * * When Katherine had been at Harbour Hill for a week she wondered how upon earth she was going to put in the remaining seven .
"Harbour Hill was noted for its beauty , but not every woman can live by scenery alone ."
"`` Aunt Elizabeth , '' said Katherine one day , `` does anybody ever die in Harbour Hill ?"
Because it does n't seem to me it would be any change for them if they did . ''
Aunt Elizabeth 's only reply to this was a shocked look .
"To pass the time Katherine took to collecting seaweeds , and this involved long tramps along the shore ."
On one of these occasions she met with an adventure .
The place was a remote spot far up the shore .
"Katherine had taken off her shoes and stockings , tucked up her skirt , rolled her sleeves high above her dimpled elbows , and was deep in the absorbing process of fishing up seaweeds off a craggy headland ."
"She looked anything but dignified while so employed , but under the circumstances dignity did not matter ."
"Presently she heard a shout from the shore and , turning around in dismay , she beheld a man on the rocks behind her ."
He was evidently shouting at her .
What on earth could the creature want ?
"`` Come in , '' he called , gesticulating wildly ."
`` You 'll be in the bottomless pit in another moment if you do n't look out . ''
"`` He certainly must be a lunatic , '' said Katherine to herself , `` or else he 's drunk ."
What am I to do ? ''
"`` Come in , I tell you , '' insisted the stranger ."
`` What in the world do you mean by wading out to such a place ?
"Why , it 's madness . ''"
Katherine 's indignation got the better of her fear .
"`` I do not think I am trespassing , '' she called back as icily as possible ."
The stranger did not seem to be snubbed at all .
He came down to the very edge of the rocks where Katherine could see him plainly .
He was dressed in a somewhat well-worn grey suit and wore spectacles .
"He did not look like a lunatic , and he did not seem to be drunk ."
"`` I implore you to come in , '' he said earnestly ."
`` You must be standing on the very brink of the bottomless pit . ''
"He is certainly off his balance , thought Katherine ."
He must be some revivalist who has gone insane on one point .
I suppose I 'd better go in .
He looks quite capable of wading out here after me if I do n't .
Subject : ` Is summer or winter best fun ? '
A lively pow-wow .
About evenly divided .
J. Flint fined five cents for disrespect to the Chair .
A collection of forty cents taken up to pay for breaking a pane of glass during a free fight of the members on the door-step .
"E. Devlin was chosen Secretary for the coming year , and a new book contributed by the Chairman . ''"
`` That 's all . ''
`` Is there any other business before the meeting ? ''
"asked Frank , as the reader closed the old book with a slam and shoved the new one across the table ."
"Ed rose , and glancing about him with an appealing look , said , as if sure his proposition would not be well received , `` I wish to propose the name of a new member ."
"Bob Walker wants to join , and I think we ought to let him ."
"He is trying to behave well , and I am sure we could help him ."
Ca n't we ? ''
"All the boys looked sober , and Joe , otherwise Brickbat , said , bluntly , `` I wo n't ."
"He 's a bad lot , and we do n't want any such here ."
Let him go with chaps of his own sort . ''
`` That is just what I want to keep him from !
"He 's a good-hearted boy enough , only no one looks after him ; so he gets into scrapes , as we should , if we were in his place , I dare say ."
"He wants to come here , and would be so proud if he was let in , I know he 'd behave ."
"Come now , let 's give him a chance , '' and Ed looked at Gus and Frank , sure that if they stood by him he should carry his point ."
"But Gus shook his head , as if doubtful of the wisdom of the plan , and Frank said gravely : `` You know we made the rule that the number should never be over eight , and we can not break it . ''"
`` You need n't .
"I ca n't be here half the time , so I will resign and let Bob have my place , '' began Ed , but he was silenced by shouts of `` No , no , you sha n't ! ''"
`` We wo n't let you off ! ''
"`` Club would go to smash , if you back out ! ''"
"`` Let him have my place ; I 'm the youngest , and you wo n't miss me , '' cried Jack , bound to stand by Ed at all costs ."
"`` We might do that , '' said Frank , who did object to small boys , though willing to admit this particular one ."
"`` Better make a new rule to have ten members , and admit both Bob and Tom Grant , '' said Ralph , whereat Grif grinned and Joe scowled , for one lad liked Merry 's big brother and the other did not ."
`` That 's a good idea !
"Put it to vote , '' said Gus , too kind-hearted to shut the door on any one ."
"`` First I want to ask if all you fellows are ready to stand by Bob , out of the club as well as in , for it wo n't do much good to be kind to him here and cut him at school and in the street , '' said Ed , heartily in earnest about the matter ."
`` I will ! ''
`` What is the matter ? ''
"asked Gilbert , who had arrived at the open kitchen door just in time to hear the sigh ."
"Anne colored , and thrust her writing out of sight under some school compositions ."
`` Nothing very dreadful .
"I was just trying to write out some of my thoughts , as Professor Hamilton advised me , but I could n't get them to please me ."
They seem so still and foolish directly they 're written down on white paper with black ink .
"Fancies are like shadows ... you ca n't cage them , they 're such wayward , dancing things ."
But perhaps I 'll learn the secret some day if I keep on trying .
"I have n't a great many spare moments , you know ."
"By the time I finish correcting school exercises and compositions , I do n't always feel like writing any of my own . ''"
"`` You are getting on splendidly in school , Anne ."
"All the children like you , '' said Gilbert , sitting down on the stone step ."
"`` No , not all ."
Anthony Pye does n't and WO N'T like me .
"What is worse , he does n't respect me ... no , he does n't ."
He simply holds me in contempt and I do n't mind confessing to you that it worries me miserably .
"It is n't that he is so very bad ... he is only rather mischievous , but no worse than some of the others ."
He seldom disobeys me ; but he obeys with a scornful air of toleration as if it was n't worthwhile disputing the point or he would ... and it has a bad effect on the others .
I 've tried every way to win him but I 'm beginning to fear I never shall .
"I want to , for he 's rather a cute little lad , if he IS a Pye , and I could like him if he 'd let me . ''"
`` Probably it 's merely the effect of what he hears at home . ''
`` Not altogether .
Anthony is an independent little chap and makes up his own mind about things .
He has always gone to men before and he says girl teachers are no good .
"Well , we 'll see what patience and kindness will do ."
I like overcoming difficulties and teaching is really very interesting work .
Paul Irving makes up for all that is lacking in the others .
"That child is a perfect darling , Gilbert , and a genius into the bargain ."
"I 'm persuaded the world will hear of him some day , '' concluded Anne in a tone of conviction ."
"`` I like teaching , too , '' said Gilbert ."
"`` It 's good training , for one thing ."
"Why , Anne , I 've learned more in the weeks I 've been teaching the young ideas of White Sands than I learned in all the years I went to school myself ."
"'T is a great thing to be weak , I trow : ye can do your worst , yet shall none punish you ; ye may steal a man 's weapons in the hour of need , yet may the man not take his own again ; -- y ' are weak , forsooth !"
"Nay , then , if one cometh charging at you with a lance , and crieth he is weak , ye must let him pierce your body through !"
Tut !
fool words ! ''
"`` And yet ye beat me not , '' returned Matcham ."
"`` Let be , '' said Dick -- `` let be ."
I will instruct you .
"Y ' ` ave been ill-nurtured , methinks , and yet ye have the makings of some good , and , beyond all question , saved me from the river ."
"Nay , I had forgotten it ; I am as thankless as thyself ."
"But , come , let us on ."
"An we be for Holywood this night , ay , or to-morrow early , we had best set forward speedily . ''"
"But though Dick had talked himself back into his usual good-humour , Matcham had forgiven him nothing ."
"His violence , the recollection of the forester whom he had slain -- above all , the vision of the upraised belt , were things not easily to be forgotten ."
"`` I will thank you , for the form 's sake , '' said Matcham ."
"`` But , in sooth , good Master Shelton , I had liever find my way alone ."
"Here is a wide wood ; prithee , let each choose his path ; I owe you a dinner and a lesson ."
Fare ye well ! ''
"`` Nay , '' cried Dick , `` if that be your tune , so be it , and a plague be with you ! ''"
"Each turned aside , and they began walking off severally , with no thought of the direction , intent solely on their quarrel ."
"But Dick had not gone ten paces ere his name was called , and Matcham came running after ."
"`` Dick , '' he said , `` it were unmannerly to part so coldly ."
"Here is my hand , and my heart with it ."
"For all that wherein you have so excellently served and helped me -- not for the form , but from the heart , I thank you ."
Fare ye right well . ''
"`` Well , lad , '' returned Dick , taking the hand which was offered him , `` good speed to you , if speed you may ."
But I misdoubt it shrewdly .
Y ' are too disputatious . ''
So then they separated for the second time ; and presently it was Dick who was running after Matcham .
"`` Here , '' he said , `` take my cross-bow ; shalt not go unarmed . ''"
`` A cross-bow ! ''
said Matcham .
"`` Nay , boy , I have neither the strength to bend nor yet the skill to aim with it ."
"`` She 's bound to be across now , '' I whispered ."
"`` Na , '' said Alan , `` her foot still sounds boss * upon the bridge . ''"
* Hollow .
And just then -- `` Who goes ? ''
"cried a voice , and we heard the butt of a musket rattle on the stones ."
"I must suppose the sentry had been sleeping , so that had we tried , we might have passed unseen ; but he was awake now , and the chance forfeited ."
"`` This 'll never do , '' said Alan ."
"`` This 'll never , never do for us , David . ''"
"And without another word , he began to crawl away through the fields ; and a little after , being well out of eye-shot , got to his feet again , and struck along a road that led to the eastward ."
"I could not conceive what he was doing ; and indeed I was so sharply cut by the disappointment , that I was little likely to be pleased with anything ."
"A moment back and I had seen myself knocking at Mr. Rankeillor 's door to claim my inheritance , like a hero in a ballad ; and here was I back again , a wandering , hunted blackguard , on the wrong side of Forth ."
`` Well ? ''
"said I. `` Well , '' said Alan , `` what would ye have ?"
They 're none such fools as I took them for .
"We have still the Forth to pass , Davie -- weary fall the rains that fed and the hillsides that guided it ! ''"
`` And why go east ? ''
"said I. `` Ou , just upon the chance ! ''"
said he .
"`` If we cannae pass the river , we 'll have to see what we can do for the firth . ''"
"`` There are fords upon the river , and none upon the firth , '' said I. `` To be sure there are fords , and a bridge forbye , '' quoth Alan ; `` and of what service , when they are watched ? ''"
"`` Well , '' said I , `` but a river can be swum . ''"
"`` By them that have the skill of it , '' returned he ; `` but I have yet to hear that either you or me is much of a hand at that exercise ; and for my own part , I swim like a stone . ''"
"`` I 'm not up to you in talking back , Alan , '' I said ; `` but I can see we 're making bad worse ."
"If it 's hard to pass a river , it stands to reason it must be worse to pass a sea . ''"
"`` But there 's such a thing as a boat , '' says Alan , `` or I 'm the more deceived . ''"
"`` Ay , and such a thing as money , '' says I. `` But for us that have neither one nor other , they might just as well not have been invented . ''"
`` Ye think so ? ''
said Alan .
"`` I do that , '' said I. `` David , '' says he , `` ye 're a man of small invention and less faith ."
"But let me set my wits upon the hone , and if I cannae beg , borrow , nor yet steal a boat , I 'll make one ! ''"
`` I think I see ye ! ''
"said I. `` And what 's more than all that : if ye pass a bridge , it can tell no tales ; but if we pass the firth , there 's the boat on the wrong side -- somebody must have brought it -- the country-side will all be in a bizz -- '' `` Man ! ''"
A handful of archers are but now come to the ferry ; murrey and blue is their wear ; they are our butts -- they shall all taste arrows -- no man of them shall struggle through this wood .
"For , lads , we are here some fifty strong , each man of us most foully wronged ; for some they have lost lands , and some friends ; and some they have been outlawed -- all oppressed !"
"Who , then , hath done this evil ?"
"Sir Daniel , by the rood !"
Shall he then profit ?
shall he sit snug in our houses ?
shall he till our fields ?
shall he suck the bone he robbed us of ?
I trow not .
"He getteth him strength at law ; he gaineth cases ; nay , there is one case he shall not gain -- I have a writ here at my belt that , please the saints , shall conquer him . ''"
Lawless the cook was by this time already at his second horn of ale .
"He raised it , as if to pledge the speaker ."
"`` Master Ellis , '' he said , `` y ' are for vengeance -- well it becometh you !"
"-- but your poor brother o ' the greenwood , that had never lands to lose nor friends to think upon , looketh rather , for his poor part , to the profit of the thing ."
He had liever a gold noble and a pottle of canary wine than all the vengeances in purgatory . ''
"`` Lawless , '' replied the other , `` to reach the Moat House , Sir Daniel must pass the forest ."
"We shall make that passage dearer , pardy , than any battle ."
"Then , when he hath got to earth with such ragged handful as escapeth us -- all his great friends fallen and fled away , and none to give him aid -- we shall beleaguer that old fox about , and great shall be the fall of him ."
'T is a fat buck ; he will make a dinner for us all . ''
"`` Ay , '' returned Lawless , `` I have eaten many of these dinners beforehand ; but the cooking of them is hot work , good Master Ellis ."
And meanwhile what do we ?
"We make black arrows , we write rhymes , and we drink fair cold water , that discomfortable drink . ''"
"`` Y ' are untrue , Will Lawless ."
"Ye still smell of the Grey Friars ' buttery ; greed is your undoing , '' answered Ellis ."
`` We took twenty pounds from Appleyard .
We took seven marks from the messenger last night .
A day ago we had fifty from the merchant . ''
"`` And to-day , '' said one of the men , `` I stopped a fat pardoner riding apace for Holywood ."
Here is his purse . ''
Ellis counted the contents .
`` Five score shillings ! ''
he grumbled .
"Emily , who had said nothing , now spoke harshly ."
"`` Lynde is right , Mr. Douglas ."
You have no right to risk your life for a stranger .
"My advice is to go to the village for help , and Lynde and I will make a fire and watch here ."
That is all that can be expected of you or us . ''
Alan paid no heed to Emily .
Very tenderly he loosened Lynde 's hold on his arm and looked into her quivering face .
"`` You know it is my duty , Lynde , '' he said gently ."
"`` If anything can be done for that poor man , I am the only one who can do it ."
"I will come back safe , please God ."
"Be brave , dear . ''"
"Lynde , with a little moan of resignation , turned away ."
Old Emily looked on with a face of grim disapproval as Alan waded out into the surf that boiled and swirled around him in a mad whirl of foam .
"The shower of sleet had again slackened , and the wreck half a mile away , with its solitary figure , was dearly visible ."
"Alan beckoned to the man to jump overboard and swim ashore , enforcing his appeal by gestures that commanded haste before the next shower should come ."
For a few moments it seemed as if the seaman did not understand or lacked the courage or power to obey .
The next minute he had dropped from the rigging on the crest of a mighty wave and was being borne onward to the shore .
"Speedily the backwater was reached and the man , sucked down by the swirl of the wave , threw up his arms and disappeared ."
"Alan dashed in , groping , swimming ; it seemed an eternity before his hand clutched the drowning man and wrenched him from the undertow ."
"And , with the seaman in his arms , he staggered back through the foam and dropped his burden on the sand at Lynde 's feet ."
"Alan was reeling from exhaustion and chilled to the marrow , but he thought only of the man he had rescued ."
"The latter was unconscious and , as Alan bent over him , he heard Lynde give a choking little cry ."
"`` He is living still , '' said Alan ."
`` We must get him up to the house as soon as possible .
How shall we manage it ? ''
"`` Lynde and I can go and bring the Captain 's mattress down , '' said Emily ."
Now that Alan was safe she was eager to do all she could .
`` Then you and I can carry him up to the house . ''
"`` That will be best , '' said Alan ."
`` Go quickly . ''
He did not look at Lynde or he would have been shocked by the agony on her face .
She cast one glance at the prostrate man and followed Emily .
"Well , he 's dead now and under hatches ; but for two year before that , shiver my timbers , the man was starving !"
"He begged , and he stole , and he cut throats , and starved at that , by the powers ! ''"
"`` Well , it ai n't much use , after all , '' said the young seaman . ''"
"` Tai n't much use for fools , you may lay to it -- that , nor nothing , '' cried Silver ."
"`` But now , you look here : you 're young , you are , but you 're as smart as paint ."
"I see that when I set my eyes on you , and I 'll talk to you like a man . ''"
You may imagine how I felt when I heard this abominable old rogue addressing another in the very same words of flattery as he had used to myself .
"I think , if I had been able , that I would have killed him through the barrel ."
"Meantime , he ran on , little supposing he was overheard ."
`` Here it is about gentlemen of fortune .
"They lives rough , and they risk swinging , but they eat and drink like fighting-cocks , and when a cruise is done , why , it 's hundreds of pounds instead of hundreds of farthings in their pockets ."
"Now , the most goes for rum and a good fling , and to sea again in their shirts ."
But that 's not the course I lay .
"I puts it all away , some here , some there , and none too much anywheres , by reason of suspicion ."
"I 'm fifty , mark you ; once back from this cruise , I set up gentleman in earnest ."
"Time enough too , says you ."
"Ah , but I 've lived easy in the meantime , never denied myself o ' nothing heart desires , and slep ' soft and ate dainty all my days but when at sea ."
And how did I begin ?
"Before the mast , like you ! ''"
"`` Well , '' said the other , `` but all the other money 's gone now , ai n't it ?"
You dare n't show face in Bristol after this . ''
"`` Why , where might you suppose it was ? ''"
asked Silver derisively .
"`` At Bristol , in banks and places , '' answered his companion ."
"`` It were , '' said the cook ; `` it were when we weighed anchor ."
But my old missis has it all by now .
"And the Spy-glass is sold , lease and goodwill and rigging ; and the old girl 's off to meet me ."
"I would tell you where , for I trust you , but it 'd make jealousy among the mates . ''"
`` And can you trust your missis ? ''
asked the other .
"`` Gentlemen of fortune , '' returned the cook , `` usually trusts little among themselves , and right they are , you may lay to it ."
"But I have a way with me , I have ."
"Take him by the knees , good Master Shelton , while I lift him by the shoulders , and let us lay him in his house ."
This will be a rare shog to poor Sir Oliver ; he will turn paper colour ; he will pray like a windmill . ''
"They took up the old archer , and carried him between them into his house , where he had dwelt alone ."
"And there they laid him on the floor , out of regard for the mattress , and sought , as best they might , to straighten and compose his limbs ."
Appleyard 's house was clean and bare .
"There was a bed , with a blue cover , a cupboard , a great chest , a pair of joint-stools , a hinged table in the chimney corner , and hung upon the wall the old soldier 's armoury of bows and defensive armour ."
Hatch began to look about him curiously .
"`` Nick had money , '' he said ."
`` He may have had three score pounds put by .
I would I could light upo n't !
"When ye lose an old friend , Master Richard , the best consolation is to heir him ."
"See , now , this chest ."
I would go a mighty wager there is a bushel of gold therein .
"He had a strong hand to get , and a hard hand to keep withal , had Appleyard the archer ."
Now may God rest his spirit !
"Near eighty year he was afoot and about , and ever getting ; but now he 's on the broad of his back , poor shrew , and no more lacketh ; and if his chattels came to a good friend , he would be merrier , methinks , in heaven . ''"
"`` Come , Hatch , '' said Dick , `` respect his stone-blind eyes ."
Would ye rob the man before his body ?
"Nay , he would walk ! ''"
"Hatch made several signs of the cross ; but by this time his natural complexion had returned , and he was not easily to be dashed from any purpose ."
"It would have gone hard with the chest had not the gate sounded , and presently after the door of the house opened and admitted a tall , portly , ruddy , black-eyed man of near fifty , in a surplice and black robe ."
"`` Appleyard '' -- the newcomer was saying , as he entered ; but he stopped dead ."
`` Ave Maria ! ''
he cried .
`` Saints be our shield !
What cheer is this ? ''
"`` Cold cheer with Appleyard , sir parson , '' answered Hatch , with perfect cheerfulness ."
"`` Shot at his own door , and alighteth even now at purgatory gates ."
Ay !
"there , if tales be true , he shall lack neither coal nor candle . ''"
"Sir Oliver groped his way to a joint-stool , and sat down upon it , sick and white ."
`` This is a judgment !
"`` Oh , I did n't mean to deceive you !"
I never thought of such a thing .
"When you asked me to write to you I wanted to , but I did n't know what to write about to a stranger ."
"I just could n't write you about my life here , not because it was hard , but it was so ugly and empty ."
So I wrote instead of the life I wanted to live -- the life I did live in imagination .
"And when once I had begun , I had to keep it up ."
"I found it so fascinating , too !"
Those letters made that other life seem real to me .
I never expected to meet you .
These last four days since your letter came have been dreadful to me .
"Oh , please go away and forgive me if you can !"
I know I can never make you understand how it came about . ''
Sidney turned away and hid her burning face against the cool white bark of the birch tree behind her .
It was worse than she had even thought it would be .
"He was so handsome , so manly , so earnest-eyed !"
"Oh , what a friend to lose !"
John Lincoln opened the gate and went up to her .
"There was a great tenderness in his face , mingled with a little kindly , friendly amusement ."
"`` Please do n't distress yourself so , Sidney , '' he said , unconsciously using her Christian name ."
`` I think I do understand .
I 'm not such a dull fellow as you take me for .
"After all , those letters were true -- or , rather , there was truth in them ."
You revealed yourself more faithfully in them than if you had written truly about your narrow outward life . ''
"Sidney turned her flushed face and wet eyes slowly toward him , a little smile struggling out amid the clouds of woe ."
This young man was certainly good at understanding .
`` You -- you 'll forgive me then ? ''
she stammered .
"`` Yes , if there is anything to forgive ."
"And for my own part , I am glad you are not what I have always thought you were ."
"If I had come here and found you what I expected , living in such a home as I expected , I never could have told you or even thought of telling you what you have come to mean to me in these lonely years during which your letters have been the things most eagerly looked forward to ."
"I should have come this evening and spent an hour or so with you , and then have gone away on the train tomorrow morning , and that would have been all ."
"`` But I find instead just a dreamy romantic little girl , much like my sisters at home , except that she is a great deal cleverer ."
"An ye were the devil , ye might go where ye will for me ."
Seek God 's forgiveness ; mine ye have freely .
But to go on to Holywood is different .
"I carry arms for York , and I will suffer no spy within their lines ."
"Hold it , then , for certain , if ye set one foot before another , I will uplift my voice and call the nearest post to seize you . ''"
"`` Ye mock me , '' said Sir Daniel ."
`` I have no safety out of Holywood . ''
"`` I care no more , '' returned Richard ."
"`` I let you go east , west , or south ; north I will not ."
Holywood is shut against you .
"Go , and seek not to return ."
"For , once ye are gone , I will warn every post about this army , and there will be so shrewd a watch upon all pilgrims that , once again , were ye the very devil , ye would find it ruin to make the essay . ''"
"`` Ye doom me , '' said Sir Daniel , gloomily ."
"`` I doom you not , '' returned Richard ."
"`` If it so please you to set your valour against mine , come on ; and though I fear it be disloyal to my party , I will take the challenge openly and fully , fight you with mine own single strength , and call for none to help me ."
"So shall I avenge my father , with a perfect conscience . ''"
"`` Ay , '' said Sir Daniel , `` y ' have a long sword against my dagger . ''"
"`` I rely upon Heaven only , '' answered Dick , casting his sword some way behind him on the snow ."
"`` Now , if your ill-fate bids you , come ; and , under the pleasure of the Almighty , I make myself bold to feed your bones to foxes . ''"
"`` I did but try you , Dickon , '' returned the knight , with an uneasy semblance of a laugh ."
`` I would not spill your blood . ''
"`` Go , then , ere it be too late , '' replied Shelton ."
`` In five minutes I will call the post .
I do perceive that I am too long-suffering .
"Had but our places been reversed , I should have been bound hand and foot some minutes past . ''"
"`` Well , Dickon , I will go , '' replied Sir Daniel ."
"`` When we next meet , it shall repent you that ye were so harsh . ''"
"And with these words , the knight turned and began to move off under the trees ."
"Dick watched him with strangely-mingled feelings , as he went , swiftly and warily , and ever and again turning a wicked eye upon the lad who had spared him , and whom he still suspected ."
"There was upon one side of where he went a thicket , strongly matted with green ivy , and , even in its winter state , impervious to the eye ."
"Herein , all of a sudden , a bow sounded like a note of music ."
"An arrow flew , and with a great , choked cry of agony and anger , the Knight of Tunstall threw up his hands and fell forward in the snow ."
And two years ago this morning I woke wondering what delightful gift the new day would give me .
These are the two years I thought would be filled with fun . ''
`` Would you exchange them -- now -- for two years filled with fun ? ''
"`` No , '' said Rilla slowly ."
`` I would n't .
It 's strange -- is n't it ?
"-- They have been two terrible years -- and yet I have a queer feeling of thankfulness for them -- as if they had brought me something very precious , with all their pain ."
"I would n't want to go back and be the girl I was two years ago , not even if I could ."
"Not that I think I 've made any wonderful progress -- but I 'm not quite the selfish , frivolous little doll I was then ."
"I suppose I had a soul then , Miss Oliver -- but I did n't know it ."
I know it now -- and that is worth a great deal -- worth all the suffering of the past two years .
"And still '' -- Rilla gave a little apologetic laugh , `` I do n't want to suffer any more -- not even for the sake of more soul growth ."
"At the end of two more years I might look back and be thankful for the development they had brought me , too ; but I do n't want it now . ''"
"`` We never do , '' said Miss Oliver ."
"`` That is why we are not left to choose our own means and measure of development , I suppose ."
No matter how much we value what our lessons have brought us we do n't want to go on with the bitter schooling .
"Well , let us hope for the best , as Susan says ; things are really going well now and if Rumania lines up , the end may come with a suddenness that will surprise us all . ''"
Rumania did come in -- and Susan remarked approvingly that its king and queen were the finest looking royal couple she had seen pictures of .
So the summer passed away .
Early in September word came that the Canadians had been shifted to the Somme front and anxiety grew tenser and deeper .
"For the first time Mrs. Blythe 's spirit failed her a little , and as the days of suspense wore on the doctor began to look gravely at her , and veto this or that special effort in Red Cross work ."
"`` Oh , let me work -- let me work , Gilbert , '' she entreated feverishly ."
`` While I 'm working I do n't think so much .
If I 'm idle I imagine everything -- rest is only torture for me .
My two boys are on the frightful Somme front -- and Shirley pores day and night over aviation literature and says nothing .
But I see the purpose growing in his eyes .
"No , I can not rest -- do n't ask it of me , Gilbert . ''"
But the doctor was inexorable .
"`` I ca n't let you kill yourself , Anne-girl , '' he said ."
`` When the boys come back I want a mother here to welcome them .
"Why , you 're getting transparent ."
It wo n't do -- ask Susan there if it will do . ''
I 'll tell you what I think of this : I think it handsome .
"And if you think as I do , you 'll give a good sea-cheer for the gentleman that does it . ''"
The cheer followed -- that was a matter of course ; but it rang out so full and hearty that I confess I could hardly believe these same men were plotting for our blood .
"`` One more cheer for Cap'n Smollett , '' cried Long John when the first had subsided ."
And this also was given with a will .
"On the top of that the three gentlemen went below , and not long after , word was sent forward that Jim Hawkins was wanted in the cabin ."
"I found them all three seated round the table , a bottle of Spanish wine and some raisins before them , and the doctor smoking away , with his wig on his lap , and that , I knew , was a sign that he was agitated ."
"The stern window was open , for it was a warm night , and you could see the moon shining behind on the ship 's wake ."
"`` Now , Hawkins , '' said the squire , `` you have something to say ."
Speak up . ''
"I did as I was bid , and as short as I could make it , told the whole details of Silver 's conversation ."
"Nobody interrupted me till I was done , nor did any one of the three of them make so much as a movement , but they kept their eyes upon my face from first to last ."
"`` Jim , '' said Dr. Livesey , `` take a seat . ''"
"And they made me sit down at table beside them , poured me out a glass of wine , filled my hands with raisins , and all three , one after the other , and each with a bow , drank my good health , and their service to me , for my luck and courage ."
"`` Now , captain , '' said the squire , `` you were right , and I was wrong ."
"I own myself an ass , and I await your orders . ''"
"`` No more an ass than I , sir , '' returned the captain ."
"`` I never heard of a crew that meant to mutiny but what showed signs before , for any man that had an eye in his head to see the mischief and take steps according ."
"But this crew , '' he added , `` beats me . ''"
"`` Captain , '' said the doctor , `` with your permission , that 's Silver ."
A very remarkable man . ''
"`` He 'd look remarkably well from a yard-arm , sir , '' returned the captain ."
`` But this is talk ; this do n't lead to anything .
"I see three or four points , and with Mr. Trelawney 's permission , I 'll name them . ''"
"`` You , sir , are the captain ."
"It is for you to speak , '' says Mr. Trelawney grandly ."
"`` First point , '' began Mr. Smollett ."
"`` We must go on , because we ca n't turn back ."
"If I gave the word to go about , they would rise at once ."
"Second point , we have time before us -- at least until this treasure 's found ."
"Third point , there are faithful hands ."
"Now , sir , it 's got to come to blows sooner or later , and what I propose is to take time by the forelock , as the saying is , and come to blows some fine day when they least expect it ."
"`` Silver , '' said the other man -- and I observed he was not only red in the face , but spoke as hoarse as a crow , and his voice shook too , like a taut rope -- `` Silver , '' says he , `` you 're old , and you 're honest , or has the name for it ; and you 've money too , which lots of poor sailors has n't ; and you 're brave , or I 'm mistook ."
And will you tell me you 'll let yourself be led away with that kind of a mess of swabs ?
Not you !
"As sure as God sees me , I 'd sooner lose my hand ."
If I turn agin my dooty -- '' And then all of a sudden he was interrupted by a noise .
"I had found one of the honest hands -- well , here , at that same moment , came news of another ."
"Far away out in the marsh there arose , all of a sudden , a sound like the cry of anger , then another on the back of it ; and then one horrid , long-drawn scream ."
"The rocks of the Spy-glass re-echoed it a score of times ; the whole troop of marsh-birds rose again , darkening heaven , with a simultaneous whirr ; and long after that death yell was still ringing in my brain , silence had re-established its empire , and only the rustle of the redescending birds and the boom of the distant surges disturbed the languor of the afternoon ."
"Tom had leaped at the sound , like a horse at the spur , but Silver had not winked an eye ."
"He stood where he was , resting lightly on his crutch , watching his companion like a snake about to spring ."
`` John ! ''
"said the sailor , stretching out his hand ."
`` Hands off ! ''
"cried Silver , leaping back a yard , as it seemed to me , with the speed and security of a trained gymnast ."
"`` Hands off , if you like , John Silver , '' said the other ."
`` It 's a black conscience that can make you feared of me .
"But in heaven 's name , tell me , what was that ? ''"
`` That ? ''
"returned Silver , smiling away , but warier than ever , his eye a mere pin-point in his big face , but gleaming like a crumb of glass ."
`` That ?
"Oh , I reckon that 'll be Alan . ''"
And at this point Tom flashed out like a hero .
`` Alan ! ''
he cried .
`` Then rest his soul for a true seaman !
"And as for you , John Silver , long you 've been a mate of mine , but you 're mate of mine no more ."
"If I die like a dog , I 'll die in my dooty ."
"You 've killed Alan , have you ?"
"Kill me too , if you can ."
But I defies you . ''
"And with that , this brave fellow turned his back directly on the cook and set off walking for the beach ."
But he was not destined to go far .
said the grocer ' I gave an old woman some coffee for the book .
If you like to give me twopence you can have the rest . '
"` Yes , ' said the student , ` give me the book instead of the cheese ."
I can eat my bread without cheese .
It would be a shame to leave the book to be torn up .
"You are a clever and practical man , but about poetry you understand as much as that old tub over there ! '"
"And that sounded rude as far as the tub was concerned , but the grocer laughed , and so did the student ."
It was only said in fun .
But the Goblin was angry that anyone should dare to say such a thing to a grocer who owned the house and sold the best butter .
"When it was night and the shop was shut , and everyone was in bed except the student , the Goblin went upstairs and took the grocer 's wife 's tongue ."
"She did not use it when she was asleep , and on whatever object in the room he put it that thing began to speak , and spoke out its thoughts and feelings just as well as the lady to whom it belonged ."
"But only one thing at a time could use it , and that was a good thing , or they would have all spoken together ."
The Goblin laid the tongue on the tub in which were the old newspapers .
"` Is it true , ' he asked , ' that you know nothing about poetry ? '"
` Certainly not ! '
answered the tub .
"` Poetry is something that is in the papers , and that is frequently cut out ."
"I have a great deal more in me than the student has , and yet I am only a small tub in the grocer 's shop . '"
"And the Goblin put the tongue on the coffee-mill , and how it began to grind !"
"He put it on the butter-cask , and on the till , and all were of the same opinion as the waste-paper tub ."
and one must believe the majority .
` Now I will tell the student ! '
and with these words he crept softly up the stairs to the attic where the student lived .
"There was a light burning , and the Goblin peeped through the key-hole and saw that he was reading the torn book that he had bought in the shop ."
But how bright it was !
Out of the book shot a streak of light which grew into a large tree and spread its branches far above the student .
"Every leaf was alive , and every flower was a beautiful girl 's head , some with dark and shining eyes , others with wonderful blue ones ."
"Every fruit was a glittering star , and there was a marvellous music in the student 's room ."
"The little Goblin had never even dreamt of such a splendid sight , much less seen it ."
"He stood on tiptoe gazing and gazing , till the candle in the attic was put out ; the student had blown it out and had gone to bed , but the Goblin remained standing outside listening to the music , which very softly and sweetly was now singing the student a lullaby . '"
I have never seen anything like this ! '
said the Goblin . '
"He was a pale , tallowy creature , wanting two fingers of the left hand , and though he wore a cutlass , he did not look much like a fighter ."
"I had always my eye open for seafaring men , with one leg or two , and I remember this one puzzled me ."
"He was not sailorly , and yet he had a smack of the sea about him too ."
"I asked him what was for his service , and he said he would take rum ; but as I was going out of the room to fetch it , he sat down upon a table and motioned me to draw near ."
"I paused where I was , with my napkin in my hand ."
"`` Come here , sonny , '' says he ."
`` Come nearer here . ''
I took a step nearer .
`` Is this here table for my mate Bill ? ''
he asked with a kind of leer .
"I told him I did not know his mate Bill , and this was for a person who stayed in our house whom we called the captain ."
"`` Well , '' said he , `` my mate Bill would be called the captain , as like as not ."
"He has a cut on one cheek and a mighty pleasant way with him , particularly in drink , has my mate Bill ."
"We 'll put it , for argument like , that your captain has a cut on one cheek -- and we 'll put it , if you like , that that cheek 's the right one ."
"Ah , well !"
I told you .
"Now , is my mate Bill in this here house ? ''"
I told him he was out walking .
"`` Which way , sonny ?"
Which way is he gone ? ''
"And when I had pointed out the rock and told him how the captain was likely to return , and how soon , and answered a few other questions , `` Ah , '' said he , `` this 'll be as good as drink to my mate Bill . ''"
"The expression of his face as he said these words was not at all pleasant , and I had my own reasons for thinking that the stranger was mistaken , even supposing he meant what he said ."
"But it was no affair of mine , I thought ; and besides , it was difficult to know what to do ."
"The stranger kept hanging about just inside the inn door , peering round the corner like a cat waiting for a mouse ."
"Once I stepped out myself into the road , but he immediately called me back , and as I did not obey quick enough for his fancy , a most horrible change came over his tallowy face , and he ordered me in with an oath that made me jump ."
"As soon as I was back again he returned to his former manner , half fawning , half sneering , patted me on the shoulder , told me I was a good boy and he had taken quite a fancy to me ."
"`` I have a son of my own , '' said he , `` as like you as two blocks , and he 's all the pride of my ` art ."
"But the great thing for boys is discipline , sonny -- discipline ."
"Now , if you had sailed along of Bill , you would n't have stood there to be spoke to twice -- not you ."
"That was never Bill 's way , nor the way of sich as sailed with him ."
"And here , sure enough , is my mate Bill , with a spy-glass under his arm , bless his old ` art , to be sure ."
"You and me 'll just go back into the parlour , sonny , and get behind the door , and we 'll give Bill a little surprise -- bless his ` art , I say again . ''"
"I wish I knew , though , how one ought to see about changing one 's position ."
I should very much like to move about .
"If I only could , I would glide up and down the ice there , as I saw the boys doing ; but somehow or other , I do n't know how to run . '"
` Bow-wow ! '
barked the old yard-dog ; he was rather hoarse and could n't bark very well .
His hoarseness came on when he was a house-dog and used to lie in front of the stove .
` The sun will soon teach you to run !
"I saw that last winter with your predecessor , and farther back still with his predecessors !"
They have all run away ! ' '
"I do n't understand you , my friend , ' said the Snow-man ."
` That thing up there is to teach me to run ? '
He meant the moon .
"` Well , it certainly did run just now , for I saw it quite plainly over there , and now here it is on this side . '"
"` You know nothing at all about it , ' said the yard-dog ."
"` Why , you have only just been made ."
The thing you see there is the moon ; the other thing you saw going down the other side was the sun .
"He will come up again tomorrow morning , and will soon teach you how to run away down the gutter ."
The weather is going to change ; I feel it already by the pain in my left hind-leg ; the weather is certainly going to change . ' '
"I ca n't understand him , ' said the Snow-man ; ` but I have an idea that he is speaking of something unpleasant ."
"That thing that glares so , and then disappears , the sun , as he calls it , is not my friend ."
I know that by instinct . '
` Bow-wow ! '
"barked the yard-dog , and walked three times round himself , and then crept into his kennel to sleep ."
The weather really did change .
"Towards morning a dense damp fog lay over the whole neighbourhood ; later on came an icy wind , which sent the frost packing ."
"But when the sun rose , it was a glorious sight ."
"The trees and shrubs were covered with rime , and looked like a wood of coral , and every branch was thick with long white blossoms ."
"The most delicate twigs , which are lost among the foliage in summer-time , came now into prominence , and it was like a spider 's web of glistening white ."
"The lady-birches waved in the wind ; and when the sun shone , everything glittered and sparkled as if it were sprinkled with diamond dust , and great diamonds were lying on the snowy carpet ."
` Is n't it wonderful ? '
exclaimed a girl who was walking with a young man in the garden .
"They stopped near the Snow-man , and looked at the glistening trees ."
"All are keeping a sharp look-out in front , but none suspects that the danger may be creeping up from behind ."
This shows how real the island was .
The first to fall out of the moving circle was the boys .
"They flung themselves down on the sward , close to their underground home . '"
"I do wish Peter would come back , ' every one of them said nervously , though in height and still more in breadth they were all larger than their captain . '"
"I am the only one who is not afraid of the pirates , ' Slightly said , in the tone that prevented his being a general favourite ; but perhaps some distant sound disturbed him , for he added hastily , ` but I wish he would come back , and tell us whether he has heard anything more about Cinderella . '"
"They talked of Cinderella , and Tootles was confident that his mother must have been very like her ."
"It was only in Peter 's absence that they could speak of mothers , the subject being forbidden by him as silly ."
"` All I remember about my mother , ' Nibs told them , ` is that she often said to father , `` Oh , how I wish I had a cheque-book of my own . ''"
"I do n't know what a cheque-book is , but I should just love to give my mother one . '"
While they talked they heard a distant sound .
"You or I , not being wild things of the woods , would have heard nothing , but they heard it , and it was the grim song : ` Yo ho , yo ho , the pirate life , The flag o ' skull and bones , A merry hour , a hempen rope , And hey for Davy Jones . '"
At once the lost boys -- but where are they ?
They are no longer there .
Rabbits could not have disappeared more quickly .
I will tell you where they are .
"With the exception of Nibs , who has darted away to reconnoitre , they are already in their home under the ground , a very delightful residence of which we shall see a good deal presently ."
But how have they reached it ?
"for there is no entrance to be seen , not so much as a pile of brushwood , which if removed would disclose the mouth of a cave ."
"Look closely , however , and you may note that there are here seven large trees , each having in its hollow trunk a hole as large as a boy ."
"These are the seven entrances to the home under the ground , for which Hook has been searching in vain these many moons ."
Will he find it to-night ?
"As the pirates advanced , the quick eye of Starkey sighted Nibs disappearing through the wood , and at once his pistol flashed out ."
But an iron claw gripped his shoulder .
"` Captain , let go , ' he cried , writhing ."
Now for the first time we hear the voice of Hook .
It was a black voice .
"` Put back that pistol first , ' it said threateningly ."
` It was one of those boys you hate .
I could have shot him dead . '
"` Ay , and the sound would have brought Tiger Lily 's redskins upon us ."
Do you want to lose your scalp ? '
"And when the loaves lay in crumbs on the road , the horse galloped on ."
"By-and-by they entered a rocky pass between two mountains , and here they saw an eagle which had been caught in a hunter 's net ."
"` Get down and cut the meshes of the net , and set the poor bird free , ' said the horse ."
"` But it will take so long , ' objected Jose , ` and we may miss the princess . '"
"` Never mind that ; do not lose a chance of helping others , ' answered the horse ."
"And when the meshes were cut , and the eagle was free , the horse galloped on ."
"The had ridden many miles , and at last they came to a river , where they beheld a little fish lying gasping on the sand , and the horse said : ` Do you see that little fish ?"
It will die if you do not put it back in the water . '
"` But , really , we shall never find the Princess Bella-Flor if we waste our time like this ! '"
cried Jose .
"` We never waste time when we are helping others , ' answered the horse ."
And soon the little fish was swimming happily away .
"A little while after they reached a castle , which was built in the middle of a very thick wood , and right in front was the Princess Bella-Flor feeding her hens ."
"` Now listen , ' said the horse . '"
"I am going to give all sorts of little hops and skips , which will amuse the Princess Bella-Flor ."
"Then she will tell you that she would like to ride a little way , and you must help her to mount ."
"When she is seated I shall begin to neigh and kick , and you must say that I have never carried a woman before , and that you had better get up behind so as to be able to manage me ."
Once on my back we will go like the wind to the king 's palace . '
"Jose did exactly as the horse told him , and everything fell out as the animal prophesied ; so that it was not until they were galloping breathlessly towards the palace that the princess knew that she was taken captive ."
"She said nothing , however , but quietly opened her apron which contained the bran for the chickens , and in a moment it lay scattered on the ground ."
"` Oh , I have let fall my bran ! '"
cried she ; ` please get down and pick it up for me . '
But Jose only answered : ` We shall find plenty of bran where we are going . '
And the horse galloped on .
"They were now passing through a forest , and the princess took out her handkerchief and threw it upwards , so that it stuck in one of the topmost branches of a tree ."
` Dear me ; how stupid !
"I have let my handkerchief blow away , ' said she ."
` Will you climb up and get it for me ? '
But Jose answered : ` We shall find plenty of handkerchiefs where we are going . '
And the horse galloped on .
"After the wood they reached a river , and the princess slipped a ring off her finger and let it roll into the water ."
"` How careless of me , ' gasped she , beginning to sob . '"
We could n't make out the words but Diana says she knows they were swearing by the sound of them .
"I ca n't believe that of Mr. Blair , for he is always so quiet and meek ; but at least he had great provocation , for Marilla , when that poor man came to the door , red as a beet , with perspiration streaming down his face , he had on one of his wife 's big gingham aprons . '"
"I ca n't get this durned thing off , ' he said , ` for the strings are tied in a hard knot and I ca n't bust 'em , so you 'll have to excuse me , ladies . '"
We begged him not to mention it and went in and sat down .
"Mr. Blair sat down too ; he twisted the apron around to his back and rolled it up , but he did look so ashamed and worried that I felt sorry for him , and Diana said she feared we had called at an inconvenient time ."
"` Oh , not at all , ' said Mr. Blair , trying to smile ... you know he is always very polite ... ` I 'm a little busy ... getting ready to bake a cake as it were ."
My wife got a telegram today that her sister from Montreal is coming tonight and she 's gone to the train to meet her and left orders for me to make a cake for tea .
She writ out the recipe and told me what to do but I 've clean forgot half the directions already .
"And it says , ` flavor according to taste . '"
What does that mean ?
How can you tell ?
And what if my taste does n't happen to be other people 's taste ?
Would a tablespoon of vanilla be enough for a small layer cake ? ''
`` I felt sorrier than ever for the poor man .
He did n't seem to be in his proper sphere at all .
I had heard of henpecked husbands and now I felt that I saw one .
"It was on my lips to say , ` Mr. Blair , if you 'll give us a subscription for the hall I 'll mix up your cake for you . '"
But I suddenly thought it would n't be neighborly to drive too sharp a bargain with a fellow creature in distress .
So I offered to mix the cake for him without any conditions at all .
He just jumped at my offer .
"He said he 'd been used to making his own bread before he was married but he feared cake was beyond him , and yet he hated to disappoint his wife ."
"He got me another apron , and Diana beat the eggs and I mixed the cake ."
Mr. Blair ran about and got us the materials .
He had forgotten all about his apron and when he ran it streamed out behind him and Diana said she thought she would die to see it .
He said he could bake the cake all right ... he was used to that ... and then he asked for our list and he put down four dollars .
So you see we were rewarded .
But even if he had n't given a cent I 'd always feel that we had done a truly Christian act in helping him . ''
Theodore White 's was the next stopping place .
"Neither Anne nor Diana had ever been there before , and they had only a very slight acquaintance with Mrs. Theodore , who was not given to hospitality ."
Should they go to the back or front door ?
While they held a whispered consultation Mrs. Theodore appeared at the front door with an armful of newspapers .
"Deliberately she laid them down one by one on the porch floor and the porch steps , and then down the path to the very feet of her mystified callers ."
"If we ca n't get ashore , all 's up . ''"
"`` Only one of the gigs is being manned , sir , '' I added ; `` the crew of the other most likely going round by shore to cut us off . ''"
"`` They 'll have a hot run , sir , '' returned the captain ."
"`` Jack ashore , you know ."
It 's not them I mind ; it 's the round-shot .
Carpet bowls !
My lady 's maid could n't miss .
"Tell us , squire , when you see the match , and we 'll hold water . ''"
"In the meanwhile we had been making headway at a good pace for a boat so overloaded , and we had shipped but little water in the process ."
"We were now close in ; thirty or forty strokes and we should beach her , for the ebb had already disclosed a narrow belt of sand below the clustering trees ."
The gig was no longer to be feared ; the little point had already concealed it from our eyes .
"The ebb-tide , which had so cruelly delayed us , was now making reparation and delaying our assailants ."
The one source of danger was the gun .
"`` If I durst , '' said the captain , `` I 'd stop and pick off another man . ''"
But it was plain that they meant nothing should delay their shot .
"They had never so much as looked at their fallen comrade , though he was not dead , and I could see him trying to crawl away ."
`` Ready ! ''
cried the squire .
`` Hold ! ''
"cried the captain , quick as an echo ."
And he and Redruth backed with a great heave that sent her stern bodily under water .
The report fell in at the same instant of time .
"This was the first that Jim heard , the sound of the squire 's shot not having reached him ."
"Where the ball passed , not one of us precisely knew , but I fancy it must have been over our heads and that the wind of it may have contributed to our disaster ."
"At any rate , the boat sank by the stern , quite gently , in three feet of water , leaving the captain and myself , facing each other , on our feet ."
"The other three took complete headers , and came up again drenched and bubbling ."
So far there was no great harm .
"No lives were lost , and we could wade ashore in safety ."
"But there were all our stores at the bottom , and to make things worse , only two guns out of five remained in a state for service ."
"Mine I had snatched from my knees and held over my head , by a sort of instinct ."
"As for the captain , he had carried his over his shoulder by a bandoleer , and like a wise man , lock uppermost ."
The other three had gone down with the boat .
"Mr. Trelawney , I 'm surprised at you , sir ."
"Doctor , I thought you had worn the king 's coat !"
"If that was how you served at Fontenoy , sir , you 'd have been better in your berth . ''"
"The doctor 's watch were all back at their loopholes , the rest were busy loading the spare muskets , and everyone with a red face , you may be certain , and a flea in his ear , as the saying is ."
The captain looked on for a while in silence .
Then he spoke .
"`` My lads , '' said he , `` I 've given Silver a broadside ."
"I pitched it in red-hot on purpose ; and before the hour 's out , as he said , we shall be boarded ."
"We 're outnumbered , I need n't tell you that , but we fight in shelter ; and a minute ago I should have said we fought with discipline ."
"I 've no manner of doubt that we can drub them , if you choose . ''"
"Then he went the rounds and saw , as he said , that all was clear ."
"On the two short sides of the house , east and west , there were only two loopholes ; on the south side where the porch was , two again ; and on the north side , five ."
"There was a round score of muskets for the seven of us ; the firewood had been built into four piles -- tables , you might say -- one about the middle of each side , and on each of these tables some ammunition and four loaded muskets were laid ready to the hand of the defenders ."
"In the middle , the cutlasses lay ranged ."
"`` Toss out the fire , '' said the captain ; `` the chill is past , and we must n't have smoke in our eyes . ''"
"The iron fire-basket was carried bodily out by Mr. Trelawney , and the embers smothered among sand ."
`` Hawkins has n't had his breakfast .
"Hawkins , help yourself , and back to your post to eat it , '' continued Captain Smollett ."
"`` Lively , now , my lad ; you 'll want it before you 've done ."
"Hunter , serve out a round of brandy to all hands . ''"
"And while this was going on , the captain completed , in his own mind , the plan of the defence ."
"`` Doctor , you will take the door , '' he resumed ."
"`` See , and do n't expose yourself ; keep within , and fire through the porch ."
"Hunter , take the east side , there ."
"Joyce , you stand by the west , my man ."
"Mr. Trelawney , you are the best shot -- you and Gray will take this long north side , with the five loopholes ; it 's there the danger is ."
"If they can get up to it and fire in upon us through our own ports , things would begin to look dirty ."
"Hawkins , neither you nor I are much account at the shooting ; we 'll stand by to load and bear a hand . ''"
"As the captain had said , the chill was past ."
"As soon as the sun had climbed above our girdle of trees , it fell with all its force upon the clearing and drank up the vapours at a draught ."
Soon the sand was baking and the resin melting in the logs of the block house .
"Jackets and coats were flung aside , shirts thrown open at the neck and rolled up to the shoulders ; and we stood there , each at his post , in a fever of heat and anxiety ."
"Then the mink crept up to him and stabbed him to the heart with his knife , and he died without moving ."
"After that he landed on the beach , skinned the wolf , and taking the skin to his cottage , he hung it up before the fire to dry ."
"Not many days later the wolf 's grandmother , who , with the help of her relations , had been searching for him everywhere , entered the cottage to buy some sea-urchins ' eggs , and saw the skin , which she at once guessed to be that of her grandson . '"
I knew he was dead -- I knew it !
I knew it ! '
"she cried , weeping bitterly , till the mink told her rudely that if she wanted to make so much noise she had better do it outside as he liked to be quiet ."
"So , half-blinded by her tears , the old woman went home the way she had come , and running in at the door , she flung herself down in front of the fire ."
` What are you crying for ? '
asked the old wolf and some friends who had been spending the afternoon with him . '
I shall never see my grandson any more ! '
answered she .
"` Mink has killed him , oh !"
oh ! '
"And putting her head down , she began to weep as loudly as ever ."
` There !
there ! '
"said her husband , laying his paw on her shoulder ."
"` Be comforted ; if he IS dead , we will avenge him . '"
And calling to the others they proceeded to talk over the best plan .
"It took them a long time to make up their minds , as one wolf proposed one thing and one another ; but at last it was agreed that the old wolf should give a great feast in his house , and that the mink should be invited to the party ."
And in order that no time should be lost it was further agreed that each wolf should bear the invitations to the guests that lived nearest to him .
"Now the wolves thought they were very cunning , but the mink was more cunning still ; and though he sent a message by a white hare , that was going that way , saying he should be delighted to be present , he determined that he would take his precautions ."
"So he went to a mouse who had often done him a good turn , and greeted her with his best bow . '"
"I have a favour to ask of you , friend mouse , ' said he , ` and if you will grant it I will carry you on my back every night for a week to the patch of maize right up the hill . '"
"` The favour is mine , ' answered the mouse ."
` Tell me what it is that I can have the honour of doing for you . '
"` Oh , something quite easy , ' replied the mink . '"
"I only want you -- between to-day and the next full moon -- to gnaw through the bows and paddles of the wolf people , so that directly they use them they will break ."
But of course you must manage it so that they notice nothing . '
"` Of course , ' answered the mouse , ` nothing is easier ; but as the full moon is to-morrow night , and there is not much time , I had better begin at once . '"
"Then the mink thanked her , and went his way ; but before he had gone far he came back again ."
"` Perhaps , while you are about the wolf 's house seeing after the bows , it would do no harm if you were to make that knot-hole in the wall a little bigger , ' said he ."
"`` Come aboard , Mr. Hands , '' I said ironically ."
"He rolled his eyes round heavily , but he was too far gone to express surprise ."
"All he could do was to utter one word , `` Brandy . ''"
"It occurred to me there was no time to lose , and dodging the boom as it once more lurched across the deck , I slipped aft and down the companion stairs into the cabin ."
It was such a scene of confusion as you can hardly fancy .
All the lockfast places had been broken open in quest of the chart .
The floor was thick with mud where ruffians had sat down to drink or consult after wading in the marshes round their camp .
"The bulkheads , all painted in clear white and beaded round with gilt , bore a pattern of dirty hands ."
Dozens of empty bottles clinked together in corners to the rolling of the ship .
"One of the doctor 's medical books lay open on the table , half of the leaves gutted out , I suppose , for pipelights ."
"In the midst of all this the lamp still cast a smoky glow , obscure and brown as umber ."
"I went into the cellar ; all the barrels were gone , and of the bottles a most surprising number had been drunk out and thrown away ."
"Certainly , since the mutiny began , not a man of them could ever have been sober ."
"Foraging about , I found a bottle with some brandy left , for Hands ; and for myself I routed out some biscuit , some pickled fruits , a great bunch of raisins , and a piece of cheese ."
"With these I came on deck , put down my own stock behind the rudder head and well out of the coxswain 's reach , went forward to the water-breaker , and had a good deep drink of water , and then , and not till then , gave Hands the brandy ."
He must have drunk a gill before he took the bottle from his mouth .
"`` Aye , '' said he , `` by thunder , but I wanted some o ' that ! ''"
I had sat down already in my own corner and begun to eat .
`` Much hurt ? ''
I asked him .
"He grunted , or rather , I might say , he barked ."
"`` If that doctor was aboard , '' he said , `` I 'd be right enough in a couple of turns , but I do n't have no manner of luck , you see , and that 's what 's the matter with me ."
"As for that swab , he 's good and dead , he is , '' he added , indicating the man with the red cap ."
`` He war n't no seaman anyhow .
And where mought you have come from ? ''
"`` Well , '' said I , `` I 've come aboard to take possession of this ship , Mr. Hands ; and you 'll please regard me as your captain until further notice . ''"
He looked at me sourly enough but said nothing .
"Some of the colour had come back into his cheeks , though he still looked very sick and still continued to slip out and settle down as the ship banged about ."
"`` By the by , '' I continued , `` I ca n't have these colours , Mr. Hands ; and by your leave , I 'll strike 'em ."
Better none than these . ''
"And again dodging the boom , I ran to the colour lines , handed down their cursed black flag , and chucked it overboard ."
`` God save the king ! ''
"Lionel ran upstairs at the last minute, and he kissed Nurse and said:"
"""Thank you for washing me. I wish I'd let you do the other ear."
"No there's no time now. Give me the hanky. Good-bye, Nurse."""
"""Good-bye, ducky,"" said Nurse. ""Be a good little King now, and say 'please' and 'thank you,' and remember to pass the cake to the little girls, and don't have more than two helps of anything."""
"So off went Lionel to be made a King. He had never expected to be a King any more than you have, so it was all quite new to him so new that he had never even thought of it. And as the coach went through the town he had to bite his tongue to be quite sure it was real, because if his tongue was real it showed he wasn't dreaming. Half an hour before he had been building with bricks in the nursery; and now the streets were all fluttering with flags; every window was crowded with people waving handkerchiefs and scattering flowers; there were scarlet soldiers everywhere along the pavements, and all the bells of all the churches were ringing like mad, and like a great song to the music of their ringing he heard thousands of people shouting, ""Long live Lionel! Long live our little King!"""
"He was a little sorry at first that he had not put on his best clothes, but he soon forgot to think about that. If he had been a girl he would very likely have bothered about it the whole time."
"As they went along, the grave gentlemen, who were the Chancellor and the Prime Minister, explained the things which Lionel did not understand."
"""I thought we were a Republic,"" said Lionel. ""I'm sure there hasn't been a King for some time."""
"""Sire, your great-great-great-great-great-grandfather's death happened when my grandfather was a little boy,"" said the Prime Minister, ""and since then your loyal people have been saving up to buy you a crown so much a week, you know, according to people's means sixpence a week from those who have first-rate pocket money, down to a halfpenny a week from those who haven't so much. You know it's the rule that the crown must be paid for by the people."""
"""But hadn't my great-great-however-much-it-is-grandfather a crown?"""
"""Yes, but he sent it to be tinned over, for fear of vanity, and he had had all the jewels taken out, and sold them to buy books. He was a strange man; a very good King he was, but he had his faults he was fond of books. Almost with his last breath he sent the crown to be tinned and he never lived to pay the tinsmith's bill."""
"Here the Prime Minister wiped away a tear, and just then the carriage stopped and Lionel was taken out of the carriage to be crowned. Being crowned is much more tiring work than you would suppose, and by the time it was over, and Lionel had worn the Royal robes for an hour or two and had had his hand kissed by everybody whose business it was to do it, he was quite worn out, and was very glad to get into the Palace nursery."
"Nurse was there, and tea was ready: seedy cake and plummy cake, and jam and hot buttered toast, and the prettiest china with red and gold and blue flowers on it, and real tea, and as many cups of it as you liked."
"After tea Lionel said: ""I think I should like a book. Will you get me one, Nurse?"""
"""Bless the child,"" said Nurse. ""You don't suppose you've lost the use of your legs with just being a King? Run along, do, and get your books yourself."""
"So Lionel went down into the library. The Prime Minister and the Chancellor were there, and when Lionel came in they bowed very low, and were beginning to ask Lionel most politely what on earth he was coming bothering for now when Lionel cried out: ""Oh, what a worldful of books!"
"Are they yours?"""
"""They are yours, Your Majesty,"" answered the Chancellor. ""They were the property of the late King, your great-great """
"""Yes, I know,"" Lionel interrupted. ""Well, I shall read them all. I love to read. I am so glad I learned to read."""
"""If I might venture to advise Your Majesty,"" said the Prime Minister, ""I should not read these books. Your great """
"""Yes?"" said Lionel, quickly."
"""He was a very good King oh, yes, really a very superior King in his way, but he was a little well, strange."""
"""Mad?"" asked Lionel, cheerfully."
"""No, no"" both the gentlemen were sincerely shocked. ""Not mad; but if I may express it so, he was er too clever by half. And I should not like a little King of mine to have anything to do with his books."""
Lionel looked puzzled.
"""The fact is,"" the Chancellor went on, twisting his red beard in an agitated way, ""your great """
"""Go on,"" said Lionel."
""" was called a wizard."""
"""But he wasn't?"""
"""Of course not a most worthy King was your great """
"""I see."""
"""But I wouldn't touch his books."""
"""Would there were folk hereaway,"" thought Halvor, ""that I might warm myself a bit and get a morsel to keep body and soul together."""
"When he got up to it he saw the light came from a wretched little hut, and through the window he saw an old old, couple inside. They were as grey-headed as a pair of doves, and the old wife had such a nose! why, it was so long she used it for a poker to stir the fire as she sat in the ingle."
"""Good evening,"" said Halvor."
"""Good evening,"" said the old wife."
"""But what errand can you have in coming hither?"" she went on, ""for no Christian folk have been here these hundred years and more."""
"Well, Halvor told her all about himself, and how he wanted to get to Soria Moria Castle, and asked if she knew the way thither."
"""No,"" said the old wife, ""that I don't, but see now, here comes the Moon, I'll ask her, she'll know all about it, for doesn't she shine on everything?"""
"So when the Moon stood clear and bright over the tree-tops, the old wife went out."
"""THOU MOON, THOU MOON,"" she screamed, ""canst thou tell me the way to Soria Moria Castle?"""
"""No,"" said the Moon, ""that I can't, for the last time I shone there a cloud stood before me."""
"""Wait a bit still,"" said the old wife to Halvor, ""bye and bye comes the West Wind; he's sure to know it, for he puffs and blows round every corner."""
"""Nay, nay,"" said the old wife when she went out again, ""you don't mean to say you've got a horse too; just turn the poor beastie loose in our 'toun,' and don't let him stand there and starve to death at the door."""
Then she ran on:
"""But won't you swop him away to me? we've got an old pair of boots here, with which you can take twenty miles at each stride; those you shall have for your horse, and so you'll get all the sooner to Soria Moria Castle."""
"That Halvor was willing to do at once; and the old wife was so glad at having the horse, she was ready to dance and skip for joy."
"""For now,"" she said, ""I shall be able to ride to church. I, too, think of that."""
"As for Halvor, he had no rest, and wanted to be off at once, but the old wife said there was no hurry."
"""Lie down on the bench with you and sleep a bit, for we've no bed to offer you, and I'll watch and wake you when the West Wind comes."""
"So after a while up came the West Wind, roaring and howling along till the walls creaked and groaned again."
Out ran the old wife.
"""THOU WEST WIND, THOU WEST WIND! Canst thou tell me the way to Soria Moria Castle? Here's one who wants to get thither."""
"""Yes, I know it very well,"" said the West Wind, ""and now I'm just off thither to dry clothes for the wedding that's to be; if he's swift of foot he can go along with me."""
Out ran Halvor.
"""You'll have to stretch your legs if you mean to keep up,"" said the West Wind."
"So off he set over field and hedge, and hill and fell, and Halvor had hard work to keep up."
"""Well,"" said the West Wind, ""now I've no time to stay with you any longer, for I've got to go away yonder and tear down a strip of spruce wood first before I go to the bleaching-ground to dry the clothes; but if you go alongside the hill you'll come to a lot of lassies standing washing clothes, and then you've not far to go to Soria Moria Castle."""
"In a little while Halvor came upon the lassies who stood washing, and they asked if he had seen anything of the West Wind who was to come and dry the clothes for the wedding."
"""Aye, aye, that I have,"" said Halvor, ""he's only gone to tear down a strip of spruce wood. It'll not be long before he's here,"" and then he asked them the way to Soria Moria Castle."
"So they put him into the right way, and when he got to the Castle it was full of folk and horses; so full it made one giddy to look at them. But Halvor was so ragged and torn from having followed the West Wind through bush and brier and bog, that he kept on one side, and wouldn't show himself till the last day when the bridal feast was to be."
"So when all, as was then right and fitting, were to drink the bride and bridegroom's health and wish them luck, and when the cupbearer was to drink to them all again, both knights and squires, last of all he came in turn to Halvor. He drank their health, but let the ring which the Princess had put upon his finger as he lay by the lake fall into the glass, and bade the cupbearer go and greet the bride and hand her the glass."
Then up rose the Princess from the board at once.
"""Who is most worthy to have one of us,"" she said, ""he that has set us free, or he that here sits by me as bridegroom?"""
"Husain Mahamat wanted him to gather it and see, but he would not till he had told his father, who said, ""That must be the fruit; go and gather it."" So Majnun went back and broke the fruit off its stalk; and he said to his father, ""Come with me to my room while I open it; I am afraid to open it alone, for perhaps I shall find a Rakshas in it that will eat me."""
"""No,"" said King Dantal; ""remember, Laili will be naked; you must go alone and do not be afraid if, after all, a Rakshas is in the fruit, for I will stay outside the door, and you have only to call me with a loud voice, and I will come to you, so the Rakshas will not be able to eat you."""
"Then Majnun took the fruit and began to cut it open tremblingly, for he shook with fear; and when he had cut it, out stepped Laili, young and far more beautiful than she had ever been. At the sight of her extreme beauty, Majnun fell backwards fainting on the floor."
"Laili took off his turban and wound it all round herself like a sari (for she had no clothes at all on), and then she called King Dantal, and said to him sadly, ""Why has Majnun fallen down like this? Why will he not speak to me? He never used to be afraid of me; and he has seen me so many, many times."""
"King Dantal answered, ""It is because you are so beautiful. You are far, far more beautiful than you ever were. But he will be very happy directly."" Then the King got some water, and they bathed Majnun's face and gave him some to drink, and he sat up again."
"Then Laili said, ""Why did you faint? Did you not see I am Laili?"""
"""Oh!"" said Prince Majnun, ""I see you are Laili come back to me, but your eyes have grown so wonderfully beautiful, that I fainted when I saw them."" Then they were all very happy, and King Dantal had all the drums in the place beaten, and had all the musical instruments played on, and they made a grand wedding-feast, and gave presents to the servants, and rice and quantities of rupees to the fakirs."
"After some time had passed very happily, Prince Majnun and his wife went out to eat the air. They rode on the same horse, and had only a groom with them. They came to another kingdom, to a beautiful garden."
"""We must go into that garden and see it,"" said Majnun."
"""No, no,"" said Laili; ""it belongs to a bad Raja, Chumman Basa, a very wicked man."" But Majnun insisted on going in, and in spite of all Laili could say, he got off the horse to look at the flowers. Now, as he was looking at the flowers, Laili saw Chumman Basa coming towards them, and she read in his eyes that he meant to kill her husband and seize her. So she said to Majnun, ""Come, come, let us go; do not go near that bad man. I see in his eyes, and I feel in my heart, that he will kill you to seize me."""
"""What nonsense,"" said Majnun. ""I believe he is a very good Raja."
"Anyhow, I am so near to him that I could not get away."""
"""Well,"" said Laili, ""it is better that you should be killed than I, for if I were to be killed a second time, Khuda would not give me my life again; but I can bring you to life if you are killed."" Now Chumman Basa had come quite near, and seemed very pleasant, so thought Prince Majnun; but when he was speaking to Majnun, he drew his scimitar and cut off the prince's head at one blow."
"Laili sat quite still on her horse, and as the Raja came towards her she said, ""Why did you kill my husband?"""
"""Because I want to take you,"" he answered."
"""You cannot,"" said Laili."
"""Yes, I can,"" said the Raja."
"""Take me, then,"" said Laili to Chumman Basa; so he came quite close and put out his hand to take hers to lift her off her horse. But she put her hand in her pocket and pulled out a tiny knife, only as long as her hand was broad, and this knife unfolded itself in one instant till it was such a length! and then Laili made a great sweep with her arm and her long, long knife, and off came Chumman Basa's head at one touch."
"Then Laili slipped down off her horse, and she went to Majnun's dead body, and she cut her little finger inside her hand straight down from the top of her nail to her palm, and out of this gushed blood like healing medicine. Then she put Majnun's head on his shoulders, and smeared her healing blood all over the wound, and Majnun woke up and said, ""What a delightful sleep I have had! Why, I feel as if I had slept for years!"" Then he got up and saw the Raja's dead body by Laili's horse."
"""What's that?"" said Majnun."
"""That is the wicked Raja who killed you to seize me, just as I said he would."""
"""Who killed him?"" asked Majnun."
"""I did,"" answered Laili, ""and it was I who brought you to life."""
"""Do bring the poor man to life if you know how to do so,"" said Majnun."
"""No,"" said Laili, ""for he is a wicked man, and will try to do you harm."" But Majnun asked her for such a long time, and so earnestly to bring the wicked Raja to life, that at least she said, ""Jump up on the horse, then, and go far away with the groom."""
"""What will you do,"" said Majnun, ""if I leave you? I cannot leave you."""
"""I will take care of myself,"" said Laili; ""but this man is so wicked, he may kill you again if you are near him."" So Majnun got up on the horse, and he and the groom went a long way off and waited for Laili."
"Then she set the wicked Raja's head straight on his shoulders, and she squeezed the wound in her finger till a little blood-medicine came out of it. Then she smeared this over the place where her knife had passed, and just as she saw the Raja opening his eyes, she began to run, and she ran, and ran so fast, that she outran the Raja, who tried to catch her; and she sprang up on the horse behind her husband, and they rode so fast, so fast, till they reached King Dantal's palace."
"There Prince Majnun told everything to his father, who was horrified and angry. ""How lucky for you that you have such a wife,"" he said."
"""Why did you not do what she told you? But for her, you would be now dead."" Then he made a great feast out of gratitude for his son's safety, and gave many, many rupees to the fakirs. And he made so much of Laili. He loved her dearly; he could not do enough for her. Then he built a splendid palace for her and his son, with a great deal of ground about it, and lovely gardens, and gave them great wealth, and heaps of servants to wait on them. But he would not allow any but their servants to enter their gardens and palace, and he would not allow Majnun to go out of them, nor Laili; ""for,"" said King Dantal, ""Laili is so beautiful, that perhaps some one may kill my son to take her away."""
"The Tiger, the Brahman, and the Jackal"
"""Very well,"" said the crow, ""open your mouth wide, and I'll fly down and see."" So the Rohu opened his jaws and the crow flew down, but he came up again very quickly. ""You have a Rakshas in your stomach,"" said the crow, and he flew away. This news did not comfort the poor Rohu, and he swam on and on till he came to Prince Majnun's country. There he stopped. And a jackal came down to the river to drink. ""Oh, jackal,"" said the Rohu, ""do tell me what I have inside me."""
"""How can I tell?"" said the jackal. ""I cannot see unless I go inside you."" So the Rohu opened his mouth wide, and the jackal jumped down his throat; but he came up very quickly, looking much frightened and saying, ""You have a Rakshas in your stomach, and if I don't run away quickly, I am afraid it will eat me."" So off he ran. After the jackal came an enormous snake. ""Oh,"" says the fish, ""do tell me what I have in my stomach, for it rattles about so, and keeps saying, 'Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun.'"""
"The snake said, ""Open your mouth wide, and I'll go down and see what it is."" The snake went down: when he returned he said, ""You have a Rakshas in your stomach, but if you will let me cut you open, it will come out of you."" ""If you do that, I shall die,"" said the Rohu. ""Oh, no,"" said the snake, ""you will not, for I will give you a medicine that will make you quite well again."" So the fish agreed, and the snake got a knife and cut him open, and out jumped Laili."
"She was now very old. Twelve years she had wandered about the jungle, and for twelve years she had lived inside her Rohu; and she was no longer beautiful, and had lost her teeth. The snake took her on his back and carried her into the country, and there he put her down, and she wandered on and on till she got to Majnun's court-house, where King Majnun was sitting. There some men heard her crying, ""Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun,"" and they asked her what she wanted. ""I want King Majnun,"" she said."
"So they went in and said to Prince Majnun, ""An old woman outside says she wants you."" ""I cannot leave this place,"" said he; ""send her in here."" They brought her in and the prince asked her what she wanted."
"""I want to marry you,"" she answered. ""Twenty-four years ago you came to my father the Phalana Raja's country, and I wanted to marry you then; but you went away without marrying me. Then I went mad, and I have wandered about all these years looking for you."" Prince Majnun said, ""Very good."""
"""Pray to Khuda,"" said Laili, ""to make us both young again, and then we shall be married."" So the prince prayed to Khuda, and Khuda said to him, ""Touch Laili's clothes and they will catch fire, and when they are on fire, she and you will become young again."" When he touched Laili's clothes they caught fire, and she and he became young again."
"And there were great feasts, and they were married, and travelled to the Phalana country to see her father and mother."
"Now Laili's father and mother had wept so much for their daughter that they had become quite blind, and her father kept always repeating, ""Laili, Laili, Laili."" When Laili saw their blindness, she prayed to Khuda to restore their sight to them, which he did. As soon as the father and mother saw Laili, they hugged her and kissed her, and then they had the wedding all over again amid great rejoicings. Prince Majnun and Laili stayed with Munsuk Raja and his wife for three years, and then they returned to King Dantal, and lived happily for some time with him."
"They used to go out hunting, and they often went from country to country to eat the air and amuse themselves."
"One day Prince Majnun said to Laili, ""Let us go through this jungle."""
"""No, no,"" said Laili; ""if we go through this jungle, some harm will happen to me."" But Prince Majnun laughed, and went into the jungle."
"And as they were going through it, Khuda thought, ""I should like to know how much Prince Majnun loves his wife. Would he be very sorry if she died? And would he marry another wife? I will see."" So he sent one of his angels in the form of a fakir into the jungle; and the angel went up to Laili, and threw some powder in her face, and instantly she fell to the ground a heap of ashes."
"Prince Majnun was in great sorrow and grief when he saw his dear Laili turned into a little heap of ashes; and he went straight home to his father, and for a long, long time he would not be comforted. After a great many years he grew more cheerful and happy, and began to go again into his father's beautiful garden with Husain Mahamat. King Dantal wished his son to marry again. ""I will only have Laili for my wife; I will not marry any other woman,"" said Prince Majnun."
"""How can you marry Laili? Laili is dead. She will never come back to you,"" said the father."
"""Then I'll not have any wife at all,"" said Prince Majnun."
"Meanwhile Laili was living in the jungle where her husband had left her a little heap of ashes. As soon as Majnun had gone, the fakir had taken her ashes and made them quite clean, and then he had mixed clay and water with the ashes, and made the figure of a woman with them, and so Laili regained her human form, and Khuda sent life into it. But Laili had become once more a hideous old woman, with a long, long nose, and teeth like tusks; just such an old woman, excepting her teeth, as she had been when she came out of the Rohu fish; and she lived in the jungle, and neither ate nor drank, and she kept on saying, ""Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun."""
"At last the angel who had come as a fakir and thrown the powder at her, said to Khuda, ""Of what use is it that this woman should sit in the jungle crying, crying for ever, 'Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun,'"
"and eating and drinking nothing? Let me take her to Prince Majnun."""
"""Well,"" said Khuda, ""you may do so; but tell her that she must not speak to Majnun if he is afraid of her when he sees her; and that if he is afraid when he sees her, she will become a little white dog the next day. Then she must go to the palace, and she will only regain her human shape when Prince Majnun loves her, feeds her with his own food, and lets her sleep in his bed."""
"So the angel came to Laili again as a fakir and carried her to King Dantal's garden. ""Now,"" he said, ""it is Khuda's command that you stay here till Prince Majnun comes to walk in the garden, and then you may show yourself to him. But you must not speak to him, if he is afraid of you; and should he be afraid of you, you will the next day become a little white dog."" He then told her what she must do as a little dog to regain her human form."
"Laili stayed in the garden, hidden in the tall grass, till Prince Majnun and Husain Mahamat came to walk in the garden. King Dantal was now a very old man, and Husain Mahamat, though he was really only as old as Prince Majnun, looked a great deal older than the prince, who had been made quite young again when he married Laili."
"As Prince Majnun and the Wazir's son walked in the garden, they gathered the fruit as they had done as little children, only they bit the fruit with their teeth; they did not cut it. While Majnun was busy eating a fruit in this way, and was talking to Husain Mahamat, he turned towards him and saw Laili walking behind the Wazir's son. ""Oh, look, look!"" he cried, ""see what is following you; it is a Rakshas or a demon, and I am sure it is going to eat us."" Laili looked at him beseechingly with all her eyes, and trembled with age and eagerness; but this only frightened Majnun the more. ""It is a Rakshas, a Rakshas!"" he cried, and he ran quickly to the palace with the Wazir's son; and as they ran away, Laili disappeared into the jungle. They ran to King Dantal, and Majnun told him there was a Rakshas or a demon in the garden that had come to eat them."
"""What nonsense,"" said his father. ""Fancy two grown men being so frightened by an old ayah or a fakir! And if it had been a Rakshas, it would not have eaten you."" Indeed King Dantal did not believe Majnun had seen anything at all, till Husain Mahamat said the prince was speaking the exact truth. They had the garden searched for the terrible old woman, but found nothing, and King Dantal told his son he was very silly to be so much frightened. However, Prince Majnun would not walk in the garden any more."
"The next day Laili turned into a pretty little dog; and in this shape she came into the palace, where Prince Majnun soon became very fond of her. She followed him everywhere, went with him when he was out hunting, and helped him to catch his game, and Prince Majnun fed her with milk, or bread, or anything else he was eating, and at night the little dog slept in his bed."
"But one night the little dog disappeared, and in its stead there lay the little old woman who had frightened him so much in the garden; and now Prince Majnun was quite sure she was a Rakshas, or a demon, or some such horrible thing come to eat him; and in his terror he cried out, ""What do you want? Oh, do not eat me; do not eat me!"" Poor Laili answered, ""Don't you know me? I am your wife Laili, and I want to marry you. Don't you remember how you would go through that jungle, though I begged and begged you not to go, for I told you that harm would happen to me, and then a fakir came and threw powder in my face, and I became a heap of ashes. But Khuda gave me my life again, and brought me here, after I had stayed a long, long while in the jungle crying for you, and now I am obliged to be a little dog; but if you will marry me, I shall not be a little dog any more."" Majnun, however, said ""How can I marry an old woman like you? how can you be Laili? I am sure you are a Rakshas or a demon come to eat me,"" and he was in great terror."
"In the morning the old woman had turned into the little dog, and the prince went to his father and told him all that had happened. ""An old woman! an old woman! always an old woman!"" said his father. ""You do nothing but think of old women. How can a strong man like you be so easily frightened?"" However, when he saw that his son was really in great terror, and that he really believed the old woman would came back at night, he advised him to say to her, ""I will marry you if you can make yourself a young girl again. How can I marry such an old woman as you are?"""
"That night as he lay trembling in bed the little old woman lay there in place of the dog, crying ""Majnun, Majnun, I want to marry you. I have loved you all these long, long years. When I was in my father's kingdom a young girl, I knew of you, though you knew nothing of me, and we should have been married then if you had not gone away so suddenly, and for long, long years I followed you."" ""Well,"" said Majnun, ""if you can make yourself a young girl again, I will marry you."""
"Laili said, ""Oh, that is quite easy. Khuda will make me a young girl again. In two days' time you must go into the garden, and there you will see a beautiful fruit. You must gather it and bring it into your room and cut it open yourself very gently, and you must not open it when your father or anybody else is with you, but when you are quite alone; for I shall be in the fruit quite naked, without any clothes at all on."" In the morning Laili took her little dog's form, and disappeared in the garden."
"Prince Majnun told all this to his father, who told him to do all the old woman had bidden him. In two days' time he and the Wazir's son walked in the garden, and there they saw a large, lovely red fruit."
"""Oh!"" said the Prince, ""I wonder shall I find my wife in that fruit."""
"As for the baby, it cried a good deal at odd times; but at night, when its mother had settled down to sleep, it would always begin to cry, quite as a matter of course, so that she hardly got any rest at all."
This made her very tired.
"The baby could make up for its bad nights during the day if it liked, but the poor mother couldn't. So whenever she had nothing to do she used to sit and cry, because she was tired out with work and worry."
"One evening the blacksmith was busy with his forge. He was making a goat-shoe for the goat of a very rich lady, who wished to see how the goat liked being shod, and also whether the shoe would come to fivepence or sevenpence before she ordered the whole set. This was the only order John had had that week. And as he worked his wife sat and nursed the baby, who, for a wonder, was not crying."
"Presently, over the noise of the bellows and over the clank of the iron, there came another sound. The blacksmith and his wife looked at each other."
"""I heard nothing,"" said he."
"""Neither did I,"" said she."
"But the noise grew louder and the two were so anxious not to hear it that he hammered away at the goat-shoe harder than he had ever hammered in his life, and she began to sing to the baby a thing she had not had the heart to do for weeks."
"But through the blowing and hammering and singing the noise came louder and louder, and the more they tried not to hear it, the more they had to. It was like the noise of some great creature purring, purring, purring and the reason they did not want to believe they really heard it was that it came from the great dungeon down below, where the old iron was, and the firewood and the twopence worth of coal, and the broken steps that went down into the dark and ended no one knew where."
"""It can't be anything in the dungeon,"" said the blacksmith, wiping his face. ""Why, I shall have to go down there after more coals in a minute."""
"""There isn't anything there, of course. How could there be?"" said his wife. And they tried so hard to believe that there could be nothing there that presently they very nearly did believe it."
"Then the blacksmith took his shovel in one hand and his riveting hammer in the other, and hung the old stable lantern on his little finger, and went down to get the coals."
"""I am not taking the hammer because I think there is something there,"""
"said he, ""but it is handy for breaking the large lumps of coal."""
"""I quite understand,"" said his wife, who had brought the coal home in her apron that very afternoon, and knew that it was all coal dust."
"So he went down the winding stairs to the dungeon and stood at the bottom of the steps, holding the lantern above his head just to see that the dungeon really was empty, as usual. Half of it was empty as usual, except for the old iron and odds and ends, and the firewood and the coals. But the other side was not empty. It was quite full, and what it was full of was Dragon."
"""It must have come up those nasty broken steps from goodness knows where,"" said the blacksmith to himself, trembling all over, as he tried to creep back up the winding stairs."
"But the dragon was too quick for him it put out a great claw and caught him by the leg, and as it moved it rattled like a great bunch of keys, or like the sheet iron they make thunder out of in pantomimes."
"""No you don't,"" said the dragon in a spluttering voice, like a damp squib."
"""Deary, deary me,"" said poor John, trembling more than ever in the claw of the dragon. ""Here's a nice end for a respectable blacksmith!"""
The dragon seemed very much struck by this remark.
"""Do you mind saying that again?"" said he, quite politely."
"So John said again, very distinctly:"
"""Here is a nice end for a respectable blacksmith."""
"""I didn't know,"" said the dragon. ""Fancy now! You're the very man I wanted."""
"""So I understood you to say before,"" said John, his teeth chattering."
"""Oh, I don't mean what you mean,"" said the dragon, ""but I should like you to do a job for me. One of my wings has got some of the rivets out of it just above the joint. Could you put that to rights?"""
"""I might, sir,"" said John, politely, for you must always be polite to a possible customer, even if he be a dragon."
"""A master craftsman you are a master, of course? can see in a minute what's wrong,"" the dragon went on. ""Just come around here and feel my plates, will you?"""
"John timidly went around when the dragon took his claw away; and sure enough, the dragon's wing was hanging loose, and several of the plates near the joint certainly wanted riveting."
"The dragon seemed to be made almost entirely of iron armor a sort of tawny, red-rust color it was; from damp, no doubt and under it he seemed to be covered with something furry."
"All the blacksmith welled up in John's heart, and he felt more at ease."
And though he was very terrible he was very beautiful too.
"Jane said so, but George said, ""Oh, don't bother; I'm thinking how to get onto the Pole and try the compass without waking the brute."""
"The dragon certainly was beautiful, with his deep, clear Prussian blueness, and his rainbow-colored glitter. And rising from within the cold coil of the frozen dragon the North Pole shot up like a pillar made of one great diamond, and every now and then it cracked a little, from sheer cold. The sound of the cracking was the only thing that broke the great white silence in the midst of which the dragon lay like an enormous jewel, and the straight flames went up all around him like the stalks of tall lilies."
"And as the children stood there looking at the most wonderful sight their eyes had ever seen, there was a soft padding of feet and a hurry-scurry behind them, and from the outside darkness beyond the flame-stalks came a crowd of little brown creatures running, jumping, scrambling, tumbling head over heels and on all fours, and some even walking on their heads. They joined hands as they came near the fires and danced around in a ring."
"""It's bears,"" said Jane. ""I know it is. Oh, how I wish we hadn't come; and my boots are so wet."""
"The dancing-ring broke up suddenly, and the next moment hundreds of furry arms clutched at George and Jane, and they found themselves in the middle of a great, soft, heaving crowd of little fat people in brown fur dresses, and the white silence was quite gone."
"""Bears, indeed,"" cried a shrill voice. ""You'll wish we were bears before you've done with us."""
"This sounded so dreadful that Jane began to cry. Up to now the children had only seen the most beautiful and wondrous things, but now they began to be sorry they had done what they were told not to, and the difference between ""lawn"" and ""grass"" did not seem so great as it had at Forest Hill."
"Directly Jane began to cry, all the brown people started back. No one cries in the Arctic regions for fear of being struck by the frost. So that these people had never seen anyone cry before."
"""Don't cry for real,"" whispered George, ""or you'll get chilblains in your eyes. But pretend to howl it frightens them."""
"So Jane went on pretending to howl, and the real crying stopped: It always does when you begin to pretend. You try it."
"Then, speaking very loud so as to be heard over the howls of Jane, George said: ""Yah who's afraid? We are George and Jane who are you?"""
"""We are the sealskin dwarfs,"" said the brown people, twisting their furry bodies in and out of the crowd like the changing glass in kaleidoscopes. ""We are very precious and expensive, for we are made, throughout, of the very best sealskin."""
"""And what are those fires for?"" bellowed George for Jane was crying louder and louder."
"""Those,"" shouted the dwarfs, coming a step nearer, ""are the fires we make to thaw the dragon. He is frozen now so he sleeps curled up around the Pole but when we have thawed him with our fires he will wake up and go and eat everybody in the world except us."""
"""WHATEVER DO YOU WANT HIM TO DO THAT FOR?"" yelled George."
"""Oh just for spite,"" bawled the dwarfs carelessly as if they were saying, ""Just for fun."""
"Jane stopped crying to say: ""You are heartless."""
"""No, we aren't,"" they said. ""Our hearts are made of the finest sealskin, just like little fat sealskin purses """
"And they all came a step nearer. They were very fat and round. Their bodies were like sealskin jackets on a very stout person; their heads were like sealskin muffs; their legs were like sealskin boas; and their hands and feet were like sealskin tobacco pouches. And their faces were like seals' faces, inasmuch as they, too, were covered with sealskin."
"""Thank you so much for telling us,"" said George. ""Good evening. (Keep on howling, Jane!)"""
"But the dwarfs came a step nearer, muttering and whispering. Then the muttering stopped and there was a silence so deep that Jane was afraid to howl in it. But it was a brown silence, and she had liked the white silence better."
"Then the chief dwarf came quite close and said: ""What's that on your head?"""
And George felt it was all up for he knew it was his father's sealskin cap.
"The dwarf did not wait for an answer. ""It's made of one of us,"" he screamed, ""or else one of the seals, our poor relations. Boy, now your fate is sealed!"""
"Looking at the wicked seal-faces all around them, George and Jane felt that their fate was sealed indeed."
"The dwarfs seized the children in their furry arms. George kicked, but it is no use kicking sealskin, and Jane howled, but the dwarfs were getting used to that. They climbed up the dragon's side and dumped the children down on his icy spine, with their backs against the North Pole."
"You have no idea how cold it was the kind of cold that makes you feel small and prickly inside your clothes, and makes you wish you had twenty times as many clothes to feel small and prickly inside of."
"The sealskin dwarfs tied George and Jane to the North Pole, and, as they had no ropes, they bound them with snow-wreaths, which are very strong when they are made in the proper way, and they heaped up the fires very close and said: ""Now the dragon will get warm, and when he gets warm he will wake, and when he wakes he will be hungry, and when he is hungry he will begin to eat, and the first thing he will eat will be you."""
"The little, sharp, many-colored flames sprang up like the stalks of dream lilies, but no heat came to the children, and they grew colder and colder."
"""We shan't be very nice when the dragon does eat us, that's one comfort,"" said George. ""We shall be turned into ice long before that."""
"No! They are placed right for you to look at other people, and are where they help you hunt for food."""
"""How often may I look at my own feathers?"" asked the young Woodpecker."
"He was wondering at that minute how his tail looked, but he was determined not to turn his head."
"The old Woodpecker's eyes twinkled. ""I should think,"" he said, ""that since you are young and have no family to look after, you might preen your feathers in the morning and in the afternoon and when you go to sleep. Then, of course, when it is stormy, you will have to take your waterproof out of the pocket under your tail, and put it on one feather at a time, as all birds do. That would be often enough unless something happened to rumple them."""
"""I will not look at them any oftener,"" said the young Red-headed Woodpecker, firmly. ""I will not be called a silly fellow."" And he was as good as his word."
"His mother sighed when she heard of the change. ""I am very glad,"" said she. ""But isn't that always the way? His father and I have talked and talked, and it made no difference; but let somebody else say he is silly and vain, and behold!"""
THE NIGHT MOTH WITH A CROOKED FEELER
"The beautiful, brilliant Butterflies of the Meadow had many cousins living in the forest, most of whom were Night Moths. They also were very beautiful creatures, but they dressed in duller colors and did not have slender waists. Some of the Butterflies, you know, wear whole gowns of black and yellow, others have stripes of black and white, while some have clear yellow with only a bit of black trimming the edges of the wings."
"The Moths usually wear brown and have it brightened with touches of buff or dull blue. If they do wear bright colors, it is only on the back pair of wings, and when the Moth alights, he slides his front pair of wings over these and covers all the brightness. They do not rest with their wings folded over their heads like the Butterflies, but leave them flat."
"All the day long, when the sun is shining, the Moths have to rest on trees and dead leaves. If they were dressed in yellow or red, any passing bird would see them, and there is no telling what might happen."
"As it is, their brown wings are so nearly the color of dead leaves or bark that you might often look right at them without seeing them."
"Yet even among Moths there are some more brightly colored than others, and when you find part of the family quietly dressed you can know it is because they have to lay the eggs. Moths are safer in dull colors, and the egg-layers should always be the safest of all. If anything happened to them, you know, there would be no Caterpillar babies."
"One day a fine-looking Cecropia Moth came out of her chrysalis and clung to the nearest twig while her wings grew and dried and flattened. At first they had looked like tiny brown leaves all drenched with rain and wrinkled by somebody's stepping on them. The fur on her fat body was matted and wet, and even her feelers were damp and stuck to her head."
"Her six beautiful legs were weak and trembling, and she moved her body restlessly while she tried again and again to raise her crumpled wings."
"She had not been there so very long before she noticed another Cecropia Moth near her, clinging to the under side of a leaf. He was also just out of the chrysalis and was drying himself. ""Good morning!"" he cried."
"""I think I knew you when we were Caterpillars. Fine day to break the chrysalis, isn't it?"""
"""Lovely,"" she answered. ""I remember you very well. You were the Caterpillar who showed me where to find food last summer when the hot weather had withered so many of the plants."""
"""I thought you would recall me,"" he said. ""And when we were spinning our chrysalides we visited together. Do you remember that also?"""
"Miss Cecropia did. She had been thinking of that when she first spoke, but she hoped he had forgotten. To tell the truth, he had been rather fond of her the fall before, and she, thinking him the handsomest Caterpillar of her acquaintance, had smiled upon him and suggested that they spin their cocoons near together. During the long winter she had regretted this. ""I was very foolish,"" she thought, ""to encourage him."
"When I get my wings I may meet people who are better off than he. Now I shall have to be polite to him for the sake of old friendship. I only hope that he will make other acquaintances and leave me free. I must get into the best society."""
"All this time her neighbor was thinking, ""I am so glad to see her again, so glad, so glad! When my wings are dry I will fly over to her and we will go through the forest together."" He was a kind, warm-hearted fellow, who cared more for friendship than for beauty or family."
"Meanwhile their wings were growing fast, and drying, and flattening, so that by noon they could begin to raise them above their heads. They were very large Moths and their wings were of a soft dust color with little clear, transparent places in them and touches of the most beautiful blue, quite the shade worn by the Peacock, who lived on the farm. There was a brown and white border to their wings, and on their bodies and legs the fur was white and dark orange. When the Cecropias rest, they spread their wings out flat, and do not slide the front pair over the others as their cousins, the Sphinxes, do. The most wonderful of all, though, are their feelers."
"The Butterflies have stiff feelers on their heads with little knobs on the ends, or sometimes with part of them thick like tiny clubs. The Night Moths have many kinds of feelers, most of them being curved, and those of the Cecropias look like reddish-brown feathers pointed at the end."
"Miss Cecropia's feelers were perfect, and she waved them happily to and fro. Those of her friend, she was troubled to see, were not what they should have been. One of them was all right, the other was small and crooked. ""Oh dear,"" she said to herself, ""how that does look! I hope he will not try to be attentive to me."" He did not mind it much. He thought about other things than looks."
"As night came, a Polyphemus Moth fluttered past. ""Good evening!"" cried he. ""Are you just out? There are a lot of Cecropias coming out to-day."""
"Miss Cecropia felt quite agitated when she heard this, and wondered if she looked all right. Her friend flew over to her just as she raised her wings for flight. ""Let me go with you,"" he said."
"While she was wondering how she could answer him, several other Cecropias came along. They were all more brightly colered than she."
"""Hullo!"" cried one of them, as he alighted beside her. ""First-rate night, isn't it?"""
"He was a handsome fellow, and his feelers were perfect; but Miss Cecropia did not like his ways, and she drew away from him just as her friend knocked him off the branch. While they were fighting, another of the strangers flew to her. ""May I sit here?"" he asked."
"""Yes,"" she murmured, thinking her chance had come to get into society."
"""I must say that it served the fellow right for his rudeness to you,"""
"When the morning came the old dame was so poorly that she couldn't utter a word but groans and sighs. She was sure she should never be well again, unless she had some of those apples that grew in the orchard near the castle where the man's brothers lived; only she had no one to send for them."
"Oh! the lad was ready to go that instant; but the eleven lions went with him. So when he came to the orchard, he climbed up into the apple tree and ate as many apples as he could, and he had scarce got down before he fell into a deep sleep; but the lions all lay round him in a ring. The third day came the Troll's brothers, but they did not come in man's shape. They came snorting like man-eating steeds, and wondered who it was that dared to be there, and said they would tear him to pieces, so small that there should not be a bit of him left."
"But up rose the lions and tore the Trolls into small pieces, so that the place looked as if a dung heap had been tossed about it; and when they had finished the Trolls they lay down again. The lad did not wake till late in the afternoon, and when he got on his knees and rubbed the sleep out of his eyes, he began to wonder what had been going on, when he saw the marks of hoofs. But when he went towards the castle, a maiden looked out of a window who had seen all that had happened, and she said:"
"""You may thank your stars you weren't in that tussle, else you must have lost your life."""
"""What! I lose my life! No fear of that, I think,"" said the lad."
"So she begged him to come in, that she might talk with him, for she hadn't seen a Christian soul ever since she came there. But when she opened the door the lions wanted to go in too, but she got so frightened that she began to scream, and so the lad let them lie outside. Then the two talked and talked, and the lad asked how it came that she, who was so lovely, could put up with those ugly Trolls. She never wished it, she said; 'twas quite against her will."
"They had seized her by force, and she was the King of Arabia's daughter. So they talked on, and at last she asked him what he would do; whether she should go back home, or whether he would have her to wife. Of course he would have her, and she shouldn't go home."
"After that they went round the castle, and at last they came to a great hall, where the Trolls' two great swords hung high up on the wall."
"""I wonder if you are man enough to wield one of these,"" said the Princess."
"""Who? I?"" said the lad. ""'Twould be a pretty thing if I couldn't wield one of these."""
"With that he put two or three chairs one a-top of the other, jumped up, and touched the biggest sword with his finger tips, tossed it up in the air, and caught it again by the hilt; leapt down, and at the same time dealt such a blow with it on the floor that the whole hall shook. After he had thus got down, he thrust the sword under his arm and carried it about with him."
"So, when they had lived a little while in the castle, the Princess thought she ought to go home to her parents, and let them know what had become of her; so they loaded a ship, and she set sail from the castle."
"After she had gone, and the lad had wandered about a little, he called to mind that he had been sent out on an errand thither, and had come to fetch something for his mother's health; and though he said to himself, ""After all the old dame was not so bad but she's all right by this time"" still he thought he ought to go and just see how she was."
So he went and found both the man and his mother quite fresh and hearty.
"""What wretches you are to live in this beggarly hut,"" said the lad."
"""Come with me up to my castle, and you shall see what a fine fellow I am."""
"Well! they were both ready to go, and on the way his mother talked to him, and asked how it was he had got so strong."
"""If you must know it came of that blue belt which lay on the hill-side that time when you and I were out begging,"" said the lad."
"""Have you got it still?"" asked she."
"""Yes"" he had. It was tied round his waist."
"""Might she see it?"""
"""Yes"" she might; and with that he pulled open his waistcoat and shirt to show it to her."
"Then she seized it with both hands, tore it off, and twisted it round her fist."
"""Now,"" she cried, ""what shall I do with such a wretch as you? I'll just give you one blow, and dash your brains out!"""
"""Far too good a death for such a scamp,"" said the Troll. ""No! let's first burn out his eyes, and then turn him adrift in a little boat."""
"So they burned out his eyes and turned him adrift, in spite of his prayers and tears; but, as the boat drifted, the lions swam after, and at last they laid hold of it and dragged it ashore on an island, and placed the lad under a fir tree. They caught game for him, and they plucked the birds and made him a bed of down; but he was forced to eat his meat raw and he was blind. At last, one day the biggest lion was chasing a hare which was blind, for it ran straight over stock and stone, and the end was, it ran right up against a fir-stump and tumbled head over heels across the field right into a spring; but lo!"
"when it came out of the spring it saw its way quite plain, and so saved its life."
"""So, so!"" thought the lion, and went and dragged the lad to the spring, and dipped him over head and ears in it. So, when he had got his sight again, he went down to the shore and made signs to the lions that they should all lie close together like a raft; then he stood upon their backs while they swam with him to the mainland. When he had reached the shore he went up into a birchen copse, and made the lions lie quiet. Then he stole up to the castle, like a thief, to see if he couldn't lay hands on his belt; and when he got to the door, he peeped through the keyhole, and there he saw his belt hanging up over a door in the kitchen. So he crept softly in across the floor, for there was no one there; but as soon as he had got hold of the belt, he began to kick and stamp about as though he were mad. Just then his mother came rushing out:"
"""Dear heart, my darling little boy! do give me the belt again,"" she said."
"""Thank you kindly,"" said he. ""Now you shall have the doom you passed on me,"" and he fulfilled it on the spot. When the old Troll heard that, he came in and begged and prayed so prettily that he might not be smitten to death."
"""Well, you may live,"" said the lad, ""but you shall undergo the same punishment you gave me;"" and so he burned out the Troll's eyes, and turned him adrift on the sea in a little boat, but he had no lions to follow him."
"Now the lad was all alone, and he went about longing and longing for the Princess; at last he could bear it no longer; he must set out to seek her, his heart was so bent on having her. So he loaded four ships and set sail for Arabia."
"At that minute the great Black Brahma Cock came up behind Mr. Crow. He had heard from the Hens how rude Mr. Crow had been, and he thought that as the head of the house he ought to see about it. Well! one cannot say very much about what happened next, but the Black Brahma Cock did see about it quite thoroughly, and when the Hen-house door swung open, it was a limp, ragged, and meek-looking Crow who came out, leaving many of his feathers inside."
"The next morning Mr. Crow flew over the forest and far away. He did not want to go back there again. He heard voices as he passed a tall tree by the edge of the forest. Miss Crow was out with the Crow whom he had beaten, and they were looking for a good place in which to build. ""I don't think they will know me if they see me,"" said Mr. Crow, ""and I am sure that I don't want them to."""
THE RED-HEADED WOODPECKER CHILDREN
Mrs. Red-headed Woodpecker bent her handsome head down and listened.
"""Yes, it is! It certainly is!"" she cried, as she heard for a second time the faint ""tap-tap-tap"" of a tiny beak rapping on the inside of an egg shell. She hopped to one side of her nest and stood looking at the four white eggs that lay there. Soon the rapping was heard again and she saw one of them move a bit on its bed of chips."
"""So it is that one,"" she cried. ""I thought it would be. I was certain that I laid that one first."" And she arched her neck proudly, as the beak of her eldest child came through a crack in the shell. Now nobody else could have told one egg from another, but mothers have a way of remembering such things, and it may be because they love their children so that sometimes their sight is a little sharper, and their hearing a little keener than anybody else's."
"However that may be, she stood watching while the tiny bird chipped away the shell and squeezed out of the opening he had made. She did not even touch a piece of the shell until he was well out of it, for she knew that it is always better for children to help themselves when they can."
"It makes them strong and fits them for life. When the little Red-headed Woodpecker had struggled free, she took the broken pieces in her beak and carried them far from the nest before dropping them to the ground."
"If she had done the easiest thing and let them fall by the foot of the hollow tree where she lived, any prowling Weasel or Blue Jay might have seen them and watched for a chance to reach her babies. And that would have been very sad for the babies."
"The newly hatched bird was a tired little fellow, and the first thing he did was to take a nap. He was cold, too, although the weather was fine and sunshiny. His down was all wet from the moisture inside the egg, and you can imagine how he felt, after growing for so long inside a warm, snug shell, to suddenly be without it and know that he could never again have it around him. Even if it had been whole once more, he could not have been packed into it, for he had been stretching and growing every minute since he left it. It is for this reason that the barn-yard people have a wise saying: ""A hatched chicken never returns to his shell."""
"When Mrs. Red-headed Woodpecker came back, she covered her shivering little one with her downy breast, and there he slept, while she watched for her husband's coming, and thought how pleased and proud he would be to see the baby. They were a young couple, and this was their first child."
"But who can tell what the other three children, who had not cracked the shell, were thinking? Could they remember the time when they began to be? Could they dream of what would happen after they were hatched? Could they think at all? They were tiny, weak creatures, curled up within their shells, with food packed all around them. There had been a time when they were only streaks in the yellow liquid of the eggs. Now they were almost ready to leave this for a fuller, freer life, where they could open their bills and flutter their wings, and stretch their legs and necks. It had been a quiet, sheltered time in the shell; why should they leave it? Ah, but they must leave it, for they were healthy and growing, and when they had done so, they would forget all about it. By the time they could talk, and that would be very soon, they would have forgotten all that happened before they were hatched. That is why you can never get a bird to tell you what he thought about while in the egg."
"After the young Woodpecker's three sisters reached the outside world, the father and mother were kept busy hunting food for them, and they were alone much of the time. It was not long before they knew their parents' voices, although, once in a while, before they got their eyes open, they mistook the call of the Tree Frog below for that of the Woodpeckers. And this was not strange, for each says, ""Ker-r-ruck!"
"Ker-r-ruck!"" and when the Tree Frog was singing in his home at the foot of the tree, the four Woodpecker children, in their nest-hollow far above his head, would be opening their bills and stretching their necks, and wondering why no juicy and delicious morsel was dropped down their throats."
"When they had their eyes open there was much to be seen. At least, they thought so. Was there not the hollow in their dear, dry old tree, a hollow four or five times as high as they could reach? Their mother had told them how their father and she had dug it out with their sharp, strong bills, making it roomy at the bottom, and leaving a doorway at the top just large enough for them to pass through. Part of the chips they had taken away, as the mother had taken the broken shells, and part had been left in the bottom of the hollow for the children to lie on. ""I don't believe in grass, hair, and down, as a bed for children,"" their father had said. ""Nice soft chips are far better."""
"And the Woodpecker children liked the chips, and played with them, and pretended that they were grubs to be caught with their long and bony tongues; only of course they never swallowed them."
"It was an exciting time when their feathers began to grow. Until then they had been clothed in down; but now the tiny quills came pricking through their skin, and it was not so pleasant to snuggle up to each other as it had once been. Now, too, the eldest of the family began to show a great fault. He was very vain. You can imagine how sorry his parents were."
Every morning when he awakened he looked first of all at his feathers.
"Those on his breast were white, and he had a white band on his wings."
"His tail and back and nearly the whole of his wings were blue-black. His head, neck, and throat were crimson. To be sure, while the feathers were growing, the colors were not very bright, for the down was mixed with them, and the quills showed so plainly that the young birds looked rather streaked."
"The sisters were getting their new suits at the same time, and there was just as much reason why they should be vain, but they were not. They were glad (as who would not be?) and they often said to each other: ""How pretty you are growing!"" They looked exactly like their brother, for it is not with the Woodpeckers as with many other birds, the sons and daughters are dressed in precisely the same way."
"As for the vain young Woodpecker, he had many troubles. He was not contented to let his feathers grow as the grass and the leaves grow, without watching. No indeed! He looked at each one every day and a great many times every day. Then, if he thought they were not growing as fast as they should, he worried about it. He wanted to hurry them along, and sometimes, when his sisters did not seem to be looking, he took hold of them with his bill and pulled. Of course this did not make them grow any faster and it did make his skin very sore, but how was he to know? He had not been out of the shell long enough to be wise."
"It troubled him, too, because he could not see his red feathers. He twisted his head this way and that, and strained his eyes until they ached, trying to see his own head and neck. It was very annoying. He thought it would have been much nicer to have the brightest feathers in a fellow's tail, where he could see them, or at any rate on his breast; and he asked his mother why it couldn't be so."
"""I once knew a young Woodpecker,"" she said, ""who thought of very little but his own beauty. I am afraid that if he had been allowed to wear his red feathers in his tail, he would never have seen anything else in this wonderful great world, but just his own poor little tail."" She looked out of the doorway as she spoke, but he knew that she meant him."
"Things went on in this way until the children were ready to fly. Then there were daily lessons in flying, alighting, clinging to branches, and tapping for food on the bark of trees. They learned, too, how to support themselves with their stiff tails when they were walking up trees or stopping to eat with their claws hooked into the bark. Then Mrs."
"Red-headed Woodpecker taught them how to tell the ripest and sweetest fruit on the trees before they tasted it. That is something many people would like to know, but it is a forest secret, and no bird will tell anyone who cannot fly."
"It was on his way back from an orchard one day, that the vain young Woodpecker stopped to talk with an old Gray Squirrel. It may be that the Gray Squirrel's sight was not good, and so he mistook the Woodpecker for quite another fellow. He was speaking of an old tree where he had spent the last winter. ""I believe a family of Red-headed Woodpeckers live there now,"" he said. ""I have met them once or twice. The father and mother are fine people, and they have charming daughters, but their son must be a great trial to them. He is one of these silly fellows who see the world through their own feathers."""
"As the young Red-headed Woodpecker flew away, he repeated this to himself: ""A silly fellow, a silly fellow, who sees the world through his own feathers."" And he said to his father, ""Whose feathers must I look through?"""
"This puzzled his father. ""Whose feathers should you look through?"" said he. ""What do you mean?"""
"""Well,"" answered the son, ""somebody said that I saw the world through my own feathers, and I don't see how I can get anybody else's."""
"How his father did laugh! ""I don't see why you should look through any feathers,"" said he. ""What he meant was that you thought so much of your own plumage that you did not care for anything else; and it is so. If it were intended you should look at yourself all the time, your eyes would have been one under your chin and the other in the back of your head."

CHAPTER SIXTEEN
Wednesday 10:05 A.M.
The limousine had already left the Savoy and was headed down the Strand
"when Alex Novosty broke the silence. He leaned forward, pushed the"
button on the two-way microphone linking the passenger compartment to
"the driver, and spoke in Russian."
"""Igor Borisovich, there's been an alteration in our plans. We will not"
be going to Westminster Union. Take us to Moscow Narodny Bank. The

AT DIEPPE.
AFTER SUNSET.
THE sea lies quieted beneath
The after-sunset flush
That leaves upon the heaped grey clouds
The grape’s faint purple blush.
"Pale, from a little space in heaven"
"Of delicate ivory,"
The sickle-moon and one gold star
Look down upon the sea.
ON THE BEACH.
"NIGHT, a grey sky, a ghostly sea,"
The soft beginning of the rain:
"Black on the horizon, sails that wane"
Into the distance mistily.
"The tide is rising, I can hear"
The soft roar broadening far along;
It cries and murmurs in my car
"ST. QUINTIN, RICHARD."
A native of Yorkshire.
One of M'Kinlie's crew that murdered Captain Glass and his family in the
Canary ship. Afterwards arrested at Cork and hanged in chains near Dublin
"on March 19th, 1765."
"STURGES, CAPTAIN."
"An Elizabethan pirate, who had his headquarters at Rochelle. In company"
"with the notorious pirate Calles, he in one year pillaged two Portuguese,"
"one French, one Spanish, and also a Scotch ship. His end is not known."
"O'SULLIVAN, LORD. Receiver of pirate plunder."
"The Sulivan Bere, of Berehaven in Ireland."
"A notorious friend of the English pirates, he bought their spoils, which"
he stored in his castle. He helped to fit out pirate captains for their
"cruises, and protected them when Queen Elizabeth sent ships to try and"
arrest them.
"SUTTON, THOMAS."
Born at Berwick in 1699.
Gunner in Roberts's ship the _Royal Fortune_. At his trial he was proved
A sleepy old forgotten song.
"Softly the stealthy night descends,"
The black sails fade into the sky:
"Is this not, where the sea-line ends,"
The shore-line of infinity?
I cannot think or dream: the grey
"Unending waste of sea and night,"
"Dull, impotently infinite,"
Blots out the very hope of day.
RAIN ON THE DOWN.
"NIGHT, and the down by the sea,"
And the veil of rain on the down;
And she came through the mist and the rain to me
From the safe warm lights of the town.
"The rain shone in her hair,"
And her face gleamed in the rain;
And only the night and the rain were there
As she came to me out of the rain.
BEFORE THE SQUALL.
"_Peter, Lake._"
"_Peter, Mt._"
"_Peter-Hansen_, Erik."
"_Peter_ Lewis, a true tale."
When there are two appellatives coming in different parts of
"the alphabet, cross-reference from the rejected one, as _Thomas"
Cantuariensis_. See _Thomas Becket_.
Arrange in two alphabets names that differ slightly in spelling and
"come close together in the alphabet: e.g.,"
"_Brown_ and _Browne_, and the French names beginning with _Saint_ and"
_Sainte_. As readers may not always know the spelling of the author's
"name, cross-references should be made: e.g., _Brown_. See also _Browne_."
Arrange by the forename headings in which the family name is the
same.
"No attention is to be paid to prefixes, as _Bp., Capt., Dr., Hon., Sir,"
"Fräulein, Miss, Mlle., Mme., Mrs._, or to suffixes, as _D.D., F.R.S.,"
"LL.D._, etc."
"When the forenames are the same, arrange chronologically."
"No attention is to be paid to the titles _Sir_, etc.: e.g., _Bart, T."
"L._, comes before _Bart, Thomas_, for the same reason that _Bart_ comes"
before _Barta_.
Forenames not generally used should be neglected in the arrangement.
When an author is generally known by one of several forenames he will

"Her face a refrain,"

SPRING TWILIGHT.
To K. W.
"THE twilight droops across the day,"
I watch her portrait on the wall
Palely recede into the grey
That palely comes and covers all.
"The sad Spring twilight, dull, forlorn,"
The menace of the dreary night:
"But in her face, more fair than morn,"
A sweet suspension of delight.
IN WINTER.
"PALE from the watery west, with the pallor of winter a-cold,"
"Morgan, with 2 ships of 20 guns, and having seen this, I crave he would"
"come out upon the coast and seek me, that he might see the valour of the"
Spaniards. And because I had no time I did not come to the mouth of Port
"Royal to speak by word of mouth in the name of my king, whom God preserve."
"Dated the 5th of July, 1670."""
"PARKER, CAPTAIN WILLIAM. Buccaneer."
"Just after the city of Porto Bello had been made, as the Spanish thought,"
"impregnable, by the building of the massive stone fort of San Jerome, the"
"daring Parker, with but 200 English desperadoes, took the place by storm,"
burning part of the town and getting quickly and safely away with a huge
amount of booty.
"PARKINS, BENJAMIN."
One of Captain John Quelch's crew in the brigantine _Charles_. Tried at
Boston for piracy in 1704.
"PARROT, JAMES."
"One of Quelch's crew, who turned King's evidence at the trial at Boston in"
"1704, and thus escaped hanging."
"PATTERSON, NEAL."
Of Aberdeen.
"In 1653 he was caught in a storm in the Virgin Islands, and his fleet was"
"wrecked. His brother, Prince Maurice, was lost with his ship, the"
"_Defiance_, the only ship saved being the _Swallow_. Prince Rupert"
returned in the _Swallow_ to France in the same year. Hitherto the prince
"had been a restless, clever man, ""very sparkish in his dress,"" but this"
"catastrophe to his fleet and the loss of his brother broke his spirit, and"
"he retired to England, where he died in his bed in 1682 at Spring Gardens."
"LE SAGE, CAPTAIN. French filibuster."
"In 1684 was at San Domingo, in command of the _Tigre_, carrying thirty"
guns and a crew of 130 men.
"SALTER, EDWARD."
Hanged in Virginia in 1718 with the rest of Captain Teach's crew.
"SAMPLE, CAPTAIN RICHARD. Buccaneer."
"Was at New Providence Island in 1718, and received the royal pardon from"
"King George, offered to those pirates who surrendered themselves to"
"Governor Woodes Rogers. Like many another, he fell again into his former"
"wicked ways, and ended his life by being hanged."
"SAMPLE, CAPTAIN ROBERT."
"One of England's crew in the _Royal James_. In 1720 they took a prize, the"
They walked to the Piazza del Popólo and through the Via Babuino to the
Piazza di Spagna.
“Would you like to go to a Benedictine abbey tomorrow?” asked Kennedy.
“All right.”
"“And if you are still melancholy, we will leave you there.”"
_THE ABBEY_
"The next day, after lunch, Kennedy and Cæsar went to visit the abbey of"
"Sant’ Anselmo on the Aventine. The abbot, Hildebrand, was a friend"
"of Kennedy’s, and like him an Englishman."
They took a carriage and Kennedy told it to stop at the church of Santa
Sabina.
"“It is still too early to go to the abbey. Let us look at this church,"
which is the best preserved of all the old Roman ones.”
They entered the church; but it was so cold there that Cæsar went out
again directly and waited in the porch. There was a man there selling

critic. He has written a eulogy of Anthony Bickersteth that is to
appear in a few days--you must win his favour to your poems.”
The old baronet cackled with senile laughter.
Fosse threw up his head. He glowed. He felt that all eyes were upon him.
"“Yes,” he said--“my eulogy appears to-morrow.” He forgot to bawl."
Sir Gilders put his hand to his ear: the entrance and stir of the
arriving guests and their announcement and greetings perplexed his weak
hearing:

"The horseman looked for a moment in Francesco's face but, hardened as"
"he was, he dared not abide the trial. There was such a stare of"

"compressed, as if he feared to give expression to his feelings."

There was a sudden rush of air; something came for a moment between
his Majesty and the sun; and then all was quiet again.
"""What was it?"" asked Hyacinth, slightly alarmed."
"""Most extraordinary,"" said the King.  ""It left in my mind an"

"""The King of Barodia,"" said Hyacinth, ""has red whiskers, but I don't"

There was another rush of wind in the opposite direction; once more
"the sun was obscured, and this time, plain for a moment for all to"
"see, appeared the rapidly dwindling back view of the King of Barodia"
on his way home to breakfast.
Merriwig rose with dignity.
"""You're quite right, Hyacinth,"" he said sternly; ""it _was_ the King of"
"Barodia."""
Hyacinth looked troubled.
"""He oughtn't to come over anybody's breakfast table quite so quickly"
"as that.  Ought he, Father?"""

"The magic and the mystery that are night’s,"
And human love without the pain.

Deep buried as the glooms that lay

Near and as distant as our dreams.

Free of the day and all its cares!

Too long to last where joy is brief.

"An armoured van with V.C.S., Ltd. lettered on its side pulled up to the"
black marble front of Moscow Narodny Bank's financial trading branch on
Saint Swithins Lane. Everything was on schedule.
"""They're here."" Eva was watching from the narrow window. Saint Swithins"
"Lane down below, virtually an alley, was so narrow it could accommodate"
"only one vehicle at a time. Across was Banque Worms, its unicorn"
"insignia staring out, its lobby chandeliers glowing. Nobody there even"
bothered to notice. Just another armored truck interrupting the view.
Then three blue-uniformed guards emerged from the cab and approached
"the rear doors from both sides, .38's in unsnapped holsters."
"""Mr. Vance, they had better have the money, all of it."" Vera stepped"
over to the window and followed Eva's gaze down.
"""It'll be there."""
"""For your sake I hope so,"" she replied as she turned back."
"""Just hang around and watch,"" Vance said."
"Just one more day, he told himself. One more lousy day. We'll have"
“Did you know that this man was alive when you married me?” he asked in
a hard voice.
"“No,” cried Yvonne. “How could I have married you? I thought he had been"
dead nearly three years.”
“What proofs did you have of his death?”
"“A friend sent me a number of the Figaro, with the announcement.”"
“Was that all?”
"“Yes,” said Yvonne."
"“Do you mean to tell me,” he insisted, “that you married a second time,"
having no further proofs of your first husband’s death than a mere
newspaper report?”
"“It never occurred to me to doubt it,” she replied, opening piteous,"
innocent eyes.
The childlike irresponsibility was above his comprehension. Her apparent
insensibility to the most vital concerns of life was another shock to
him. It seemed criminal.
"“God forgive you,” he said, “for the wrong you have done me.”"
"“But I did it unknowingly, Everard,” cried poor Yvonne. “If one has to"

"Tenderly dying, touched with pain"
A little; standing there I saw again
The sunsets that were dear to us.
I knew not if ’twere bitter or more sweet

"O bitter to be there and you not nigh,"
Yet this had been that blessed street.

"There was the house, the windows there"
"Against the rosy twilight high and bare,"
The pavement-stones: I knew them all!

"I stood and gazed, and thought of you,"
Until remembrance sweet and mournful drew
Tears to eyes smiling as of old.

"And, through a window, met two eyes that burned,"
"Tenderly questioning, on me."

"For a time there was a great silence, as if the fates of two souls"
were being weighed in the scales of destiny.
It was Francesco who spoke.

"She crept very close to him, smiling up at him with the old-time smile"
through tear-dimmed eyes.

The End.
He was borne out of the room. The Rogan leader turned to Brand and
spoke.
"""He says that if your comrade does not tell him what he wants to know,"
"your turn will come next,"" sobbed Greca. ""Oh! Why does not The Great"
"White One strike these monsters to the dust!"""
She ran to Brand and pressed her satiny cheek to his. Then she was
dragged roughly away.
The great door clanged shut. The heavy outer fastenings clicked into
place. Dex had gone to experience whatever it was that Journeyman and
the rest had experienced in this red hell. And Brand was left behind
to reflect on what dread torments this might comprise; and to pray
desperately that no matter what might be done to his shrinking body he
would be strong enough to refuse to betray his planet.
CHAPTER V
_The Torture Chamber_
"Swiftly Dex was carried down the long ramp to the ground floor, the"
arms of his captors gripping him with painful tightness. Heading the
"procession was the immensely tall, gangling Rogan leader, clutching"
Greca by the wrist and dragging her indifferently along to be his
mouthpiece.
"suspicious nature would connect George with the rescue, and would lead"
him to conclude that Hamilton must be in England.
"A maid of Lady Castlemain's told Rochester, who in turn told me, that the"
king had again set his men to work searching for Hamilton. That being the
"case, George was in danger, and should he be found by the king's secret"
"agents, who, I understood, were prowling all over England in the hope of"
"obtaining a reward, his life would not be worth a week's purchase."
"George knew the risk he ran by remaining in England, but it was a part of"
his reckless courage to take delight in it. Later on this recklessness of
disposition induced him to take a far greater risk. But of that in its
turn.
*       *       *       *       *
"After supper, I found Hamilton in his bedroom, which was connected"
by a hidden stairway with the room of the sinking floor. He wore his
"Quaker's disguise, and on the table beside him were the Bible and a few"
"theological works dear to the hearts of his sect. I gave him the box,"
telling him its history. The letter was brief and was written in cipher.
George translated it thus:--

"unveiling, I am too thrilled.”"
He kept button-holing Pangbutt:
"“Too thrilled to--er--I am thrilled, sir, thrilled, as indeed is"
"Charlotte--oh, ah, yes--Charlotte!” He searched about behind him for"
"the little old lady, who moved up to his side. “Oh, ah, yes--there"
"you are, Charlotte! Allow me to introduce Mr. Pangbutt, our host."
"May I ask, sir, if Mr. Anthony Bickersteth has yet arrived? No?..."
"How fortunate! How very fortunate!... Charlotte, I am becoming quite"
excited.”
Pangbutt led them to chairs.
Two richly-dressed ladies of an age that discovers as much as is
"concealed by considerable dressing, hesitated at the door; and one,"
taking a last amused glance over her shoulder at some incident that
"passed upon the stairs below, tittered, and, turning, swept the room"
with keen regard through her raised lorgnettes.
“How amusin’! how absolutely amusin’!” she crooned. “I like literary
and artistic people _so_ much.”
"“Yes,” said the other, “they are _so_ different to one’s own class...."
And actresses _dress_ so well!”
"She flung back an elaborate head of jewels, and whispered something to"
the lady of the lorgnettes.
The lady of the lorgnettes laughed:
“Really?” said she
And
"""Far, far from Ypers,"
"I'd like to be,"
Where German snipers
"Can't get at me."""
And
"""When this bloody war is over,"
"O how happy I shall be,"
"When I get my civvy clothes on,"
"No more soldiering for me."""
and all the other songs familiar to every soldier in the British army.
We marched all day along straight roads running in between flat fields
and past ugly little villages. As we grew tired and footsore our
rollicking spirit abated and the singing died down.
Towards nightfall we halted in a large meadow with a pond in one corner.
"Several lorries loaded with tents were waiting for us. We unloaded them,"
"pitched the tents, crept into them, and went to bed."
The rumble of the cannonade sounded faintly in the far distance.
"""I reckon it's a bloody shame to let the other Tommies and the"
"Frenchies...."""
The voice seemed to die away into a drawl as weariness overcame me. I
"continued to hear the sound of words for a little while, but they"
"""A man always says, 'who was the first one?' but the girl says, 'who'll"
"be the next one?'"" she returned, as she carefully laid the roses in her"
bureau drawer.
"""But the time comes when there never will be a next one."""
"""No?"""
"""No."""
"""I'd hate to stake my pile on that,"" observed the Girl, drily. She blew"
up each glove as it came off and likewise carefully laid them away in
the bureau drawer.
"By this time Wowkle's soft tread had ceased, her duties for the night"
"were over, and she stood at the table waiting to be dismissed."
"""Wowkle, git to your wigwam!"" suddenly ordered her mistress, watching"
her until she disappeared into the cupboard; but she did not see the
Indian woman's lips draw back in a half-grin as she closed the door
behind her.
"""Oh, you're sending her away! Must I go, too?"" asked Johnson, dismally."
"""No--not jest yet; you can stay a--a hour or two longer,"" the Girl"
informed him with a smile; and turning once more to the bureau she
busied herself there for a few minutes longer.
Johnson's joy knew no bounds; he burst out delightedly:
"""Why, I'm like Dante! I want the world in that hour, because, you see,"
"""I have shown it you before.""  Vaviloff looked up suspiciously and"
closely scanned the Captain's face.
"""Show it me!"" shouted the Captain, striking the bar with his fist and"
sitting down on a stool close by.
"""But why?"" asked Vaviloff, knowing that it was better to keep his wits"
about him when Kuvalda got excited.
"""You fool!  Bring it at once."""
"Vaviloff rubbed his forehead, and turned his eyes to the ceiling in a"
tired way.
"""Where are those papers of yours?"""
"There was no answer to this on the ceiling, so the old sergeant looked"
"down at the floor, and began drumming with his fingers on the bar in a"
worried and thoughtful manner.
"""It's no good your making wry faces!"" shouted the Captain, for he had"
"no great affection for him, thinking that a former soldier should"
rather have become a thief than an eating-house keeper.
"""Oh!  Yes!  Aristid Fomich, I remember now.  They were left at the High"
"Court of Justice at the time when I came into possession."""
"""Get along, Egorka!  It is to your own interest to show me the plan,"
"the title-deeds, and everything you have immediately.  You will"
"probably clear at least a hundred roubles over this, do you understand?"""
Vaviloff did not understand at all; but the Captain spoke in such a
“There is my husband.”
"“_Nom de Dieu!_” cried Bazouge, stifling a guffaw before the austere"
"decorum of the English churchman. “_Ça?_ Oh, my poor Yvonne!” She shook"
"hands rapidly with him and turned away. He bowed gracefully, including"
the new-comers in his salute. The Canon responded severely. Mrs.
Winstanley stared at him through her tortoise-shell lorgnette.
"“We have been looking all over the place for you,” said the Canon,"
"as they passed through the window into the _salle des jeux_, leaving"
Bazouge in the corner of the verandah.
"“I’m sorry,” said Yvonne penitently."
“And who was that rakish-looking little Frenchman you were talking to?”
"“An old friend--I used to know him,” said Yvonne, struggling with her"
agitation. “A friend of my first husband--I had to speak to him--we went
"there to be quiet. I could n’t help it, Everard, really I could n’t.”"
"“My dear child,” said the Canon, kindly, “I was not scolding you--though"
he did look rather undesirable.”
“I suppose you had to mix with all kinds of odd Bohemian people in your
professional days?” said Mrs. Winstanley.
"“Of course,” faltered Yvonne."
They went through the great hall. At the door they parted with Mrs.
"Winstanley, who was waiting for the Wilmingtons. “We will call for you"
"on our way to the concert this afternoon,” said the Canon."
Mrs. White was all concern. She summoned Pepper and instructed him to
find out the first train; she sent her maid to Trude's room to pack her
clothes. And last she wrote a generous check.
"""You may need it, my dear. It is nothing. Don't thank me. I wish I"
could do more. Somehow your shoulders seem too young to carry so much
"responsibility!"""
So on the selfsame day that Sidney and the others set out upon their
adventure Trude was journeying to Cape Cod. She missed connections at
"Boston and hired an automobile to take her to Provincetown, in her"
heart thanking Mrs. White for the check that made this possible. Two
blow-outs delayed her journey so that it was midnight when she reached
her destination. She could scarcely hunt out the Greens and Sidney at
that hour. She took a room at the hotel for the night and sat for a
while at its window straining her eyes out into the darkness. The
howling of the wind intensified her apprehension; somewhere out in that
strange blackness that enwrapped her was her little sister. Perhaps
Sidney needed her that very moment!
Finally she crept into bed and fell into a troubled sleep. She did not
hear the running steps that passed under her window or the muffled
voices of excited men.

"""WHAT THE NIGHT HELD"""
days were over. Michael had given him a perfect opportunity to start
building a new life. He didn't care if all hell was about to break
loose.
Wednesday 10:23 A.M.
"""_Polovena decyat_?"" She examined him with her dark eyes."
"""_Da_."" Novosty nodded. ""They will be here at ten-thirty. That is the"
"schedule."""
"He was feeling nervous, which was unusual and he didn't like it."
"Whenever he got that way, things always started going off the track."
"They were now in the paneled elevator, heading up to the sixth floor of"
the Moscow Narodny Bank. The hundred million had been held overnight in
"the vault of Victoria Courier Service Limited, which was scheduled to"
deliver the satchels this morning at ten-thirty sharp. The location for
"the delivery, however, was known only to him and to Michael Vance. He"
wanted to be sure and arrive there ahead of the money. He also would
have much preferred being without the company of Vera Karanova.
One thing you had to say for Michael: He'd arranged the deal with great
finesse. He didn't trust anybody. Until he notified Victoria Courier
"this morning, nobody knew where the money would be taken, not even the"
"Japanese banker Nogami. Still, the instruments were negotiable, leaving"
the possibility of trouble if the timing went sour.
"It relieves me to know she is alive, revives me, and makes me"
"superlatively brave: if he has dared to kill her, I will report it at"
once. I shall not spare him. I shall accuse him of both her death and the
lawyer's. I shall go further: I shall accuse others--the thief of last
"winter, the man that stole the sides of bacon from a tradesman and sold me"
"rolls of tobacco out of his bag. No, I shall not keep silence about"
anything then....

"When it grew light, Solem went to the kitchen, had his breakfast, settled"
"his business with Paul and the women, and returned to his room. He was in"
"no hurry; though it was no longer early in the day, he took his time about"
"tying his bundles, preparatory to leaving. Lingeringly he looked into the"
windows of the south wing as he passed.
Then Solem was gone.
A little later Miss Torsen came in to breakfast. She asked at once about
Solem. And why might she be so interested in Solem? She had certainly
stopped in her room intentionally so as to give him time to leave; if she
wanted to see him she could have been here long ago. But was it not safest
"to seem a little angry? Supposing, night owl that I was, that I had seen"
something!
"""Where is Solem?"" she asked indignantly."
CHAPTER XVIII
THE BURGLAR’S MICROPHONE
"That night I was sitting, brooding over the case, while Craig was"
studying a photograph which he made of the smudge on the glass door
down at Schloss’. He paused in his scrutiny of the print to answer the
telephone.
"“Something has happened to Schloss,” he exclaimed seizing his hat and"
coat. “Winters has been watching him. He didn’t go to the Recherche.
Winters wants me to meet him at a place several blocks below it Come
on. He wouldn’t say over the wire what it was. Hurry.”
"We met Winters in less than ten minutes at the address he had given, a"
bachelor apartment in the neighborhood of the Recherche.
"“Schloss kept rooms here,” explained Winters, hurrying us quickly"
upstairs. “I wanted you to see before anyone else.”
As we entered the large and luxuriously furnished living room of the
"jeweler’s suite, a gruesome sight greeted us."
"There lay Schloss on the floor, face down, in a horribly contorted"
"position. In one hand, clenched under him partly, the torn sleeve of a"
woman’s dress was grasped convulsively. The room bore unmistakable
"traces of a violent struggle, but except for the hideous object on the"
floor was vacant.
"Kennedy bent down over him. Schloss was dead. In a corner, by the door,"
"""Too lively to be talked about,"" he said. ""I doubt if the regiment"
"isn't going to add itself to the general disaster."""
"""Oh, rot!"" was the young officer's forgetful lapse into disrespect."
"""The regiment will do for the beggars all right. They didn't expect us"
"so soon, I fancy. Just listen! I believe I've frightened them away"
"already. There isn't a sound."""
"Colonel Carmichael lifted his head. True enough, no living thing"
"seemed to move. A profound hush hung in the air, broken only by Mrs."
Cary's pitiful meanings.
"""Oh, Beatrice, Beatrice, where are you?"""
Geoffries turned his stained face to the Colonel's.
"""Beatrice! That's Miss Cary, isn't it? Anything happened to her?"""
Colonel Carmichael shrugged his shoulders with the impatience of a man
whose nerves are overstrained by anxiety.
"""I don't know--we've lost her,"" he said. ""We must do something at"
"once. Heaven alone knows what has happened."""
No one indeed knew what had happened--not even the lonely man who
"waited, revolver in hand, for the final encounter on whose issue hung"
the fortunes of them all.
"Only one knew, and that was Beatrice herself as she stood before the"
"shattered doorway of the Colonel's drawing-room, amidst the debris of"
"wrecked, shot-riddled furniture, face to face with Nehal Singh."

"Cæsar paused, because the monk’s countenance was growing dark. In the"
"twilight of his pallid face, his nose looked like a comet portending"
some public calamity.
“Poor wretch!” murmured the monk. “You do not know what you are saying.
You are blaspheming. You are offending God.” “Do you really believe that
"God has any relation to my uncle?” asked Cæsar, paying more attention"
to his toast than to his visitor.
And then he added:
“The truth is that it would be extravagant behaviour on the part of
God.”
"The monk looked at Cæsar with terrible eyes. Those grey eyes of his,"
"under their long, black, thick brows, shot lightning."
“Poor wretch!” repeated the monk. “You ought to have more respect for
things above you.”
Cæsar arose.
"""Waynsford, by Jove!"" ejaculated Terence. ""Bless you, Dick, I never"
"expected to see you here and in this rig. What has happened?"""
"""Oh, I chucked the Motor Boat Reserve,"" declared Waynsford. ""It was a"
"bit too dull. They sent me to Southampton, and that was the limit. A"
"superannuated postman could have done my job, which was delivering"
letters to transports. So I applied for the Naval Air Service. It's
"more in my line."""
"""Been across yet?"" asked Terence, indicating the twenty odd mile"
strip of water that separated Great Britain from the scene of land
hostilities.
"""Dunkirk twice,"" replied Waynsford. ""Was there when the Germans"
started shelling the place. But we're off again early to-morrow
"morning."""
"""Yes, I heard,"" said Aubyn. ""Big operations. We are to engage the"
Zeebrugge and Ostend batteries while the Allied airmen play with the
"German lines of communication. So I may see something of you."""
"""I hope so--after the fun is over,"" replied the young airman. ""Well,"
I must be moving. Early hours and a good night's rest are essential
"to this sort of work."""
"The two friends parted, Terence making for the hotel, while Waynsford"
"walked off in the direction of the castle, in which the airmen"
detailed for the great raid were temporarily quartered.
Precisely at one hour before sunrise the first British waterplane
rose from the surface of Dover Harbour. Almost simultaneously an Army
"aeroplane ""kicked off"" from the sloping ground beyond the chalk"
"week...!"""
"""Das macht nichts. The rooms are wanted and I won't have you on the"
"premises. Off you go, or these soldiers shall take you both round to"
"the Kommandantur."""
"""But our luggage? _Surely_ you will let me go up to our room and"
"pack it--and take it away? We..."""
"""Your luggage has been packed and is in the corridor. If you send"
"round for it, it shall be delivered to your messenger. But you are"
"not to stop on the premises another minute. You understand?"" he"
almost shrieked.
"""But--"""
"For answer, the soldiers took them by the shoulders and whirled"
"them through the revolving door on to the pavement, where a crowd"
"began to collect, as it does in peace or war if you cough twice or"
"sneeze three times in Brussels. ""Englische Hure! Englische"
"Küpplerin,"" shouted the soldiers as they retreated and locked the"
revolving door. Mrs. Warren turned purple and swayed. Vivie caught
her round the waist with her strong arm.... Thus was Mrs. Warren
ejected from the once homely inn which she had converted by her
"energy, management and capital into the second most magnificent"
hostelry of Brussels; thus was Vivie expelled from the place of her
birth....
Hearing the shouting and seeing the crowd a Belgian gendarme came
"up. To him Vivie said, ""Si vous êtes Chrétien et pas Allemand--"""
"""Prenez garde, Madame,"" he said warningly--""Vous m'aiderez à porter"
"ma mère à quelqu' endroit ou elle peut se remettre..."""
"""You need not assure me of that,"" I answered, taking Betty's hand. ""I"
"already know it. I am glad you--"""
"But here I was interrupted by a soft cry from Bettina, and by a"
"half-smothered scream from Frances, both of whom deserted me suddenly"
"and ran toward the door I had just entered. Turning, I saw Frances with"
"her arms about the Abbé's neck, and Bettina clasping one of his hands."
"I thought the two had gone mad, but when Bettina saw my look of surprise"
"and inquiry, she dropped his hand, came to me, and asked:--"
"""Did you want us to pretend that we did not know him? If so, you should"
"have told us."""
"""But you don't know him,"" I declared."
"""Perhaps I don't,"" she returned, laughing softly and shrugging her"
"shoulders, ""but evidently your cousin does. If not, she should take her"
"arms from around his neck."""
"""But she is mistaken,"" I insisted."
"""She seems to be convinced,"" answered Bettina, with a curious little"
"glance up to me, half laughing, half inquiring. Evidently she was"
doubtful whether I spoke in jest or in earnest.
"Frances still clung to the Abbé, her head resting on his shoulder, so I"
"started toward her, intending to correct her mistake. Bettina, seeing my"
"purpose, caught me by the arm, saying:--"
"""Don't you really know?"""
"The Abbé turned his face toward me, and when I caught a glimpse of his"
"Yes, they were all satisfied. The Lieutenant pronounced it ""blendend"""
(dazzling). They had not eaten so much and such good food for months and
"months. Oh it was good to be out of the fighting. Yes, their treatment"
was perfect--except for the thieving. Why were British soldiers allowed
"to steal the buttons, caps, rings, and watches belonging to their"
prisoners?
"A German private, a tall thin man with bushy eyebrows, who had not"
"spoken hitherto, said he didn't mind losing a few buttons--but to rob a"
"man of his marriage ring, that was very mean--eine Gemeinheit--his"
marriage ring had been taken from him: he would have lost anything
"rather than that, for it always reminded him of home."
The boy from East Prussia said he didn't care what they took from him as
long as they didn't take his life. He was safe now and nothing else
mattered. He spoke with a Polish accent.
I asked him what town he came from.
"""Allenstein."""
"""Did you see anything of the Russians in 1914?"""
"""Jawohl""--he had seen plenty of Russian troops. They behaved very well."
"""Die sind besser als die Deutschen--They're better than the Germans...."""
"But the theatre orderly interrupted us and asked us to ""send two or"
"three across."""
I went to the Prep. to see if there were any new arrivals. It was full
once again and the wounded were streaming into the station.
Thursday 2:34 P.M.
Vance recognized the sound immediately. It was the harp-like plucking
"of a Japanese _koto_, punctuated by the tinkling of a wind chime."
"Without opening his eyes, he reached out and touched a hard, textured"
"surface. It was, he realized, a straw mat, and from the firmness of the"
weave he knew it was _tatami_. Then he felt the soft cotton of the
padded mat beneath him and guessed he was lying on a futon. The air in
the room was faintly spiced with Mahayana Buddhist temple incense.
"I'm in Japan, he told himself. Or somebody wants me to think I am."
He opened his eyes and found himself looking at a rice-paper lamp on
"the floor next to his futon. Directly behind it, on the left, was a"
"_tokonoma _art alcove, built next to a set of sliding doors. A small,"
round _shoji_ window in the _tokonoma  _shed a mysterious glow on its
"hanging scroll, the painting an ink sketch of a Zen monk fording a"
shallow stream.
Then he noticed an insignia that had been painted on the sliding doors
"with a giant brush. He struggled to focus, and finally grasped that it"
"was the Minoan double ax, logo of the Daedalus Corporation."
Jesus!
"He lay a minute, nursing the ache in his head and trying to remember"
"what had happened. All he could recall was London, money, Eva . . ."

John Dennis showed human surprise as Frank Corson lunged at him. He had
"either been lax in using the controlling power he'd been given, or else"
Frank Corson had an exceptional resistance.
"Dennis released Rhoda, swayed drunkenly under Frank Corson's clumsy"
"football-type tackle, and swung his arm like a pivoting beam. The blow"
"was a lucky one. His fist smashed low on Corson's jaw, numbing the"
nerves of his neck on the left side.
"Corson went down and, as he lay helpless, Dennis kicked him twice--once"
"in the side and once, viciously effectively, in the head. Corson rolled"
over and lay still.
"Dennis looked down at him in a drunken daze. ""They will make an army and"
"bring it here."""
"Rhoda, standing in the center of an emotional maelstrom, watched the"
struggle from the prison of her own horror. At that moment she was
"physically, mentally and spiritually ill; a human being caught in the"
midst of forces beyond her knowledge and control.
"Dennis laid a heavy hand on her shoulder. ""I want to make love."""
"""No--no. Please--"""
The drunkenness ebbed slightly and his eyes emptied. They looked into
Rhoda's. She shivered. He took the neck of her brunch coat in his fist
and jerked downward. She had just come from the shower when she'd first
"opened the door for Frank Corson, and the vicious denuding gesture left"
"Nick rose high above the other sounds of the night, calling,"
"""Min-Minnie-Girl, let us in!"" she hurriedly brushed past him and yelled"
through the door:
"""What do you want?"""
Again Johnson's hand went up imperatively.
"""Don't let him come in!"" he whispered."
"But even then she heard not his warning, but silently, tremulously"
"listened to Sonora, who shouted through the door: ""Say, Girl, you all"
"right?"" And not until her answering voice had called back her assurance"
that she was safe did she turn to the man at her side and whisper in a
voice that showed plainly her agitation and fear:
"""Jack Rance is there! If he was to see you here--he's that jealous I'd"
"be afraid--"" She checked her words and quickly put her ear close to the"
"door, the voices outside having become louder and more distinct."
"Presently she spun round on her heel and announced excitedly: ""Ashby's"
"there, too!"" And again she put her ear to the door."
"""Ashby!"" The exclamation fell from Johnson's lips before he was aware of"
it. It was impossible to deceive himself any longer--the posse had
tracked him!
"""We want to come in, Girl!"" suddenly rang out from the well-known voice"
of Nick.
"""But you can't come in!"" shouted back the Girl above the noise of the"
"storm; then, taking advantage of a particularly loud howl of the blast,"
"she turned to Johnson and inquired: ""What will I say? What reason will I"
"She was not to see me again, for I asked permission of the queen to"
"withdraw, and immediately left the ball."
"While I was crossing the park on my way back to Whitehall, the wind"
moaned and groaned--it did not breathe. The stars did not twinkle--they
glared. The nightingales did not sing--they screamed. And the roses were
odorless. Perhaps all this change to gloom was within me rather than
"without, but it existed just the same, and I went home and to bed, hating"
"all the world save Bettina, whom I vowed for the hundredth time never to"
see again.
"The next day at noon De Grammont came to my closet, where I had waited"
for him all morning.
"""Welcome to you, dear count!"" I cried, leading him by the hand to a"
chair.
"""Perhaps you will not so warmly welcome me,"" he returned, ""when you learn"
"my errand."""
"""I already know your errand, Count Grammont, and it makes you doubly"
"welcome,"" I answered, drawing a chair for myself and sitting down in"
front of him.
"""Ah, that is of good,"" he returned, rubbing his hands. ""You already know"
"the purpose of my visit?"""
"""Yes, I do, my dear count, but any purpose would delight me which brings"
"the pleasure of your company."""
"""Ah, it is said like a civilized man,"" he returned, complimenting"
"orientation spin. He rolled to the side, flailing an arm to try and"
"recover his balance, but the room was in rotation, his vision playing"
tricks.
"The one thing he did see was Vera Karanova standing over him, a blurred"
"image his mind tried vainly to correct. Her face was faltering, the"
indistinct outlines of a desert mirage. Was she real or was he merely
dreaming?
". . . Now the room was growing serene, a slow-motion phantasmagoria of"
"pastel colors and soft, muted sounds. He tried to reach out, but there"
"was nothing. Instead he heard faint music, dulcet beckoning tones. The"
"world had entered another dimension, a seamless void. He wanted to be"
"part of its emptiness, to swathe himself in the cascade of oblivion"
"lifting him up. A perfect repose was drifting through him, a wave of"
darkness. He heard his own breathing as he was buoyed into a blood-red
"mist. He was floating, on a journey he had long waited to take, to a"
"place far, far away. . . ."

"He started to walk with long strides through the sad, empty streets."
"He went toward the river and met Kennedy, who was coming back, he told"
"him, from the studio of a sculptor friend of his."
“You look like desolation. What has happened to you?”
"“Nothing, but I am in a perfectly hellish humour.”"
“I am melancholy too. It must be the weather. Let’s take a walk.”
"They went along the bank of the Tiber. Full of clay, more turbid than"
"ever, and very high between the white embankments hemming it in, the"
river looked like a big sewer.
“This is not the ‘coeruleus Tibris’ that Virgil speaks of in the
"Aeneld, which presented itself to Aeneas in the form of an ancient man"
"with his head crowned with roses,” said Kennedy."
"“No. This is a horrible river,” Cæsar opined."
"They followed the shore, passed the Castel Sant’ Angelo and the bridge"
with the statues.
"From the embankment, to the right, they could now see narrow lanes, sunk"
"almost below the level of the river. On the other bank a new, white"
edifice towered in the rain.
"They went as far as the Piazza d’Armi, and then came back at nightfall"
to Rome. The rain was gradually ceasing and the sky looked less
threatening. A file of greenish gaslights followed the river-wall and
then crossed over the bridge.
"his _Euralia Past and Present_ the eminent historian, Roger"
"Scurvilegs, does not spare her; but that she had her great qualities I"
should be the last to deny.
"She had been writing poetry that morning, and she wore green.  She"
"always wore green when the Muse was upon her: a pleasing habit which,"
"whether as a warning or an inspiration, modern poets might do well to"
imitate.  She carried an enormous diary under her arm; and in her mind
several alternative ways of putting down her reflections on her way to
the Palace.
"""Good morning, dear Countess,"" said the King, rising only too gladly"
"from his nibs; ""an early visit."""
"""You don't mind, your Majesty?"" said the Countess anxiously.  ""There"
was a point in our conversation yesterday about which I was not quite
"certain----"""
"""What _were_ we talking about yesterday?"""
"""Oh, your Majesty,"" said the Countess, ""affairs of state,"" and she"
"gave him that wicked, innocent, impudent, and entirely scandalous look"
"which he never could resist, and you couldn't either for that matter."
"""Affairs of state, of course,"" smiled the King."
"""Why, I made a special note of it in my diary."""
She laid down the enormous volume and turned lightly over the pages.
"""Here we are! '_Thursday._  His Majesty did me the honour to consult"
"me about the future of his daughter, the Princess Hyacinth.  Remained"
"""This idea is hopelessly haywire,"" Wilson said unhappily."
"""It sure is,"" said Space-Tech Maury Allison. ""But everything is, at"
"first."""
"""You hope to make something out of it?"""
"""We hope,"" replied Allison. ""We can't be sure."""
"""But surely this pile of junk has been tested before?"""
Allison nodded.
"""Any results?"""
"""Some. We've had as much as five minutes of constant operation out of"
"it."""
"As he spoke, the hemisphere over their heads flashed a full bright"
"green, then went black. A bell tinkled somewhere and a couple of techs"
dropped their tools and headed for the back room on the double. A
couple of others stood up from their work and lit cigarettes because
their instruments had gone dead. Some of the rest continued to nurse
their particular circuits because that section was still running.
[Illustration: The dome became a riot of flaming green.]
"After scanning the operation to see which section had gone blooey,"
"Allison went on. ""We've never tested this outfit under anything"
but ideal conditions. We've had spacecraft sent out to specified
"distances, fired up the gizmo and found fragments of response right"
"where there should be a response."""
red glow illumined the sky.
"The two men looked at each other, grimly, soberly."
"""We're here,"" said Dex, flexing the muscles of his powerful arms."
"""We are,"" said Brand, patting the gun in his holster."
The rapid dusk of the giant planet began to close in on them. The thin
"sunlight darkened; and with its lowering, the red spot of Jupiter"
"glared more luridly ahead of them. Silently the two men gazed at it,"
and wondered what it held.
"They shot the space ship toward it, and halted a few hundred miles"
"away. Watery white light from the satellites, ""that jitter around in"
"the sky like a bunch of damned waterbugs,"" as Dex put it, was now the"
sole illumination.
"They hung motionless in their space shell, to wait through the"
five-hour Jovian night for the succeeding five hours of daylight to
"illumine a slow cruise over the red area that, in less than a year,"
had swallowed up three of Earth's space ships. And ever as they
"waited, dozing a little, speculating as to the nature of the danger"
"they faced, the peep, peep of the radio shrilled in their ears to tell"
them that there was still a connection--though a very tenuous
one--with their mother planet.
*       *       *       *       *
"""Red spot ten miles away,"" said Brand in the transmitter. ""We're"
"approaching it slowly."""
"""Oh, that's all right,"" said Larsen, carelessly. ""Him and me used to"
"fish together."" And as if this were a sufficient explanation, he turned"
"back to his conversation, leaving Emerson to proceed on his way,"
"vaguely displeased at the episode, yet reflecting that heretofore he"
had never had occasion to doubt Larsen's loyalty.
"He found Cherry at home, and, flinging himself into one of her"
"easy-chairs, relieved his mind of the day's occurrences."
"""Marsh is building those traps purely out of spite,"" she declared,"
"indignantly, when he had finished. ""He doesn't need any more fish--he"
"has plenty of traps farther up the river."""
"""To be sure! It looks as if we might have to depend upon the"
"gill-netters."""
"""We will know before long. If the fish strike in where George expects,"
"Marsh will be out a pretty penny."""
"""And if they don't strike in where George expects, we will be out all"
"the expense of building that trap."""
"""Exactly! It's a fascinating business, isn't it? It's a business in"
which the unexpected is forever happening. But the stakes are high
"and--I know you will succeed."""
"Boyd smiled at her comforting assurance, her belief in him was always"
stimulating.
"""By-the-way,"" she continued, ""have you heard the historic story about"
"the pink salmon?"""
blow he could.
"""I know some people are very ready to be at his feet,"" he said, with a"
sneering smile.
His shaft hit the mark. Alicia flushed and sat speechless. A glance at
Lady Eynesford's face told him the scene had lasted too long: he rose
"and took his leave, paying Alicia the homage of a bow, but not seeking"
"her hand. She took no notice of his salute, and Lady Eynesford only"
"gasped ""Good-bye."""
The two sat silent for some moments after he had gone; then Lady
"Eynesford remarked,"
"""Were you mad, Alicia? See what you laid yourself open to! Oh, of course"
"a gentleman wouldn't have said it, but you yourself didn't treat him as"
"if he was a gentleman. Really, I can make a great deal of allowance for"
"him. Your manner was inexcusable."""
Alicia did not attempt to defend herself.
"""You are out of temper,"" continued her sister-in-law, ""and you choose to"
hit the first person within reach; if you can do that you care nothing
for my dignity or your own self-respect. You parade your--your interest
"in this man----"""
"""I shall never speak to him again."""
"""I'm glad to hear it, and, if you come into my drawing-room, I will"
"thank you to behave yourself properly and be civil to my guests,"" and"
Lady Eynesford walked out of the room.
He showed me his thumbnail; there was no mark on it.
"The newspaper reporters wrote articles and sent telegrams, not only about"
"the Blue Peak and the dreadful death, but about the locality, and about"
"the Tore Peak resort, that haven for the weary, with its wonderful"
buildings set like jewels in the mountains. What a surprise to come here:
"gargoyles, living room, piano, all the latest books, timber outside ready"
"for new jewels in their setting, altogether a magnificent picture of"
Norway's modern farming.
"Yes, indeed, the newspapermen appreciated it. And they did their"
advertising.
The English arrived.
"""Where is Solem?"" they asked, and ""Where is the Blue Peak?"" they asked."
"""We ought to get the hay in,"" said Josephine and the wife at the farm."
"""There'll be rain, and fifty cartloads are still out!"""
"That was all very well, but ""Where is Solem?"" asked the English. So Solem"
"had to go with them. The two casual laborers began to cart away the hay,"
but then the women had no one to help them rake. Confusion was rife.
Everyone rushed wildly hither and thither because there was no one to lead
them.
"The weather stayed fine overnight; it was patient, slow-moving weather. As"
"soon as the dew dried up, more hay would be brought in, perhaps all the"
"hay. Oh, we should manage all right."
"More English appeared; and ""Solem--the Blue Peak?"" they said. Their"
"Jack Norton immensely, although he knew that chances of survival were"
"better with Norton's boorish, interfering presence than without. He was"
"bored, he was angry, he was above all resentful of the time wasted in"
this spacewreck business....
"An orderly tapped Commodore Wilson on the shoulder. ""Message from"
"Terra,"" he said."
"Wilson groaned and reached for the telephone beside his bunk. ""Wilson"
"here,"" he said. ""Go ahead!"""
"""Admiral Stone. Wilson, a new ship is on the way. I want you to get"
"into this thing fully, so I'm briefing you now."""
"""New type of ship?"""
"""Well, not a new ship, but some new equipment. The Infrawave Section of"
the Space Department Radiation Laboratory has some experimental gear
"they want to try in actual service."""
"""Experimental gear?"""
"""Sheer experiment, Wilson. It's supposed to be an infrawave detecting"
"and ranging device. It's shown low grade response so far, and it may"
be entirely useless to you. But Radiation feels that even something
"incomplete and erratic may be better than going it blind."""
"Wilson sat up, interested. ""How does it work?"""
"""Darned if I know. It took a whole cruiser class to carry the junk"
"that makes it tick. It's piled in with twine and baling wire, and when"
the crate took off the advanced techs were still connecting cables and
rallied a little.
"""Who has told you this lie?"" he exclaimed, with a kind of indignation."
"""A man who does not make mistakes--or tell lies--Sergeant Cardono!"" said"
"Rollo. ""He has both seen and spoken to her! She has sworn to attack the"
"palace to-night."""
"""Then I am as good as dead already. I must go directly to my wife!"""
answered Muñoz.
But Rollo stepped before him.
"""Not without carrying an armful of these to where they will be of use,"""
"he said, pointing to the guns. And the Duke of Rianzares, without any"
"further demur, did his will. Rollo in turn took as many as he could"
"carry, and the Sergeant brought up the rear carrying a wooden box of"
"cartridges, which had evidently been packed ready for transportation."
"They returned to the large lighted room, where Mortimer, Etienne, and El"
Sarria had been left on guard. Concha and the waiting-maid seconded
their efforts by bringing store of pistols and ammunition.
"On their way they passed through a hall, which by day seemed to be"
"lighted only from the roof. Rollo bade them deposit the arms there, and"
bring the other candles and lamps to that place.
"""Every moment that a light is to be seen at an outside window adds to"
"our danger,"" he said, and Concha ran at his bidding."
"Before she had time to return, however, the Queen-Regent came in with"
"her usual dignity, the three serving-men following her. Rollo saw at"
He broke off abruptly as a sound of sliding bolts came from the
"doorway. The two men whirled around to face the door, their fists"
doubling instinctively against whatever new danger might threaten
them.
*       *       *       *       *
"The door was opened and two of their ugly, towering enemies came in,"
their tubes held conspicuously before them. Behind came another
"figure; and at sight of this one, so plainly not of the race of"
"Jupiter, the Earthmen gasped with wonder."
"They saw a girl who might have come from Earth, save that she was"
taller than most Earth women--of a regal height that reached only an
inch or two below Brand's own six foot one. She was beautifully
"formed, and had wavy dark hair and clear light blue eyes. A sort of"
"sandal covered each small bare foot; and a gauzy tunic, reaching from"
"above the knee to the shoulder, only half shielded her lovely figure."
She was bearing a metal container in which was a mess of stuff
evidently intended as food. The guards halted and stepped aside to let
"her pass into the room. Then they backed out, constantly keeping Dex"
"and Brand covered with the tubes, and closed and barred the door."
The girl smiled graciously at the admiration in the eyes of both the
men--a message needing no inter-planetary interpretation. She
"advanced, and held the metal container toward them."
"""Eat,"" she said softly. ""It is good food, and life giving."""
*       *       *       *       *
"""Got a funny feeling I know."" He was settling into the water beside"
"her. ""But if I told you, you'd probably think I'm hallucinating."" Above"
"the tub, he suddenly noticed yet another video camera."
"As they lay soaking, the _koto _music around them abruptly stopped, its"
poignant twangs disappearing with an electronic click.
"""Are you finding the accommodations adequate?"""
The voice was coming from a speaker carefully integrated into the raw
cypress ceiling.
"""All things considered, we'd sooner be in Philadelphia."" Vance looked"
up.
"""I'm sorry to hear that,"" the voice continued. ""No expense has been"
"spared. My own personal quarters have been placed at your disposal."""
"""Mind telling me who's watching me bathe?"" Eva splashed a handful of"
water at the lens.
"""You have no secrets from me, Dr. Borodin. However, in the interest of"
propriety I have switched off the monitor for the bath. I'm afraid my
"people were somewhat overly zealous, installing one there in the first"
"place."" The voice chuckled. ""But I should think you'd know. I am CEO of"
"the Daedalus Corporation, an organization not unfamiliar to you."""
"""All right,"" she said, ""so where are we?"""
"""Why, you are in the corporation's Hokkaido facility. As my guests."
"Since you two have taken such an interest in this project, I thought it"
"The doctor when he came pronounced her dead, thought it was probably"
an effusion of blood on the brain but couldn't be certain till he
had made an autopsy.
"""What _am_ I to do?"" said Vivie thinking aloud...."
"""Why, stay here till all the formalities are over and you can find"
"rooms elsewhere,"" said Mme. Trouessart, the owner-servant of the"
"tea-shop. ""I have another spare room. For the moment my locataires"
"are gone. I know you both very well by sight, you were clients of"
"ours in the happy days before the War. Madame votre mère was, I"
"think, the gérante of the Hotel Édouard-Sept when I first came to"
"manage here. Since then, you have often drunk my tea. Je me nomme"
'Trouessart' c'est le nom de mon mari qui est ... qui est--Vous
"pouvez diviner où il est, où est à present tout Belge loyal qui peut"
"servir. Le nom Walcker? C'était le nom de nom père, et de plus est,"
c'était un nom Anglais transformé un peu en Flamand. Mon
arrière-grand-père etait soldat Anglais. Il se battait à Waterloo.
"For me, I spik no English--or ver' leetle."""
"She went on to explain, whilst the doctors occupied themselves with"
"their gruesome task, and Vivie was being persuaded to take some"
"nourishment, that her great grandfather had been a soldier servant"
who had married a Belgian woman and settled down on the site of this
very shop a hundred years ago. He and his wife had even then
"made a specialty of tea for English tourists. She, his great"
"grand-daughter, had after her marriage to Monsieur Trouessart"
"carried on the business under the old name--Walker, made to look"
Flemish as Walcker.
Vivie when left alone suddenly thought of the money question. She
disappeared as he closed upon it.
There was a great wrath in his eyes.
"""We ride at sun-rise!"""
"""Our goal?""--"
"""To Naples!""--"
"The dawn was streaking the east with faint gold, and transient"
"sunshafts touched the woods, when Francesco stood before the doorway"
of his lodge of pine boughs. The men of the Duke of Spoleto were
"gathering in on every side, some girding their swords, others"
"tightening their shield-straps, as they came."
The duke ordered a single horn to sound the rally.
"The glade was full of stir and action. Companies were forming up,"
shoulder to shoulder; spears danced and swayed; horses steamed in the
brisk morning air.
"At last the tents sank down, and, as the sun cleared the trees, the"
"armed array rolled out from the woods into a stretch of open land,"
that sloped towards the bold curves of a river.
"On that morning Francesco felt almost happy, as his fingers gripped"
his sword and he cantered along by the side of the duke. The great
heart of the world seemed to beat with his.
"""The day of reckoning has come at last!"" he said to the leader of the"
free lances.
"""Don't you sell tea, bread, or anything to eat?"""
"""I trade only in walls and roofs, for which I pay to the swindling"
"proprietor of this hole--Judas Petunikoff, merchant of the second"
"guild--five roubles a month,"" explained Kuvalda in a business-like"
"tone.  ""Only those come to me who are not accustomed to comfort and"
"luxuries .... but if you are accustomed to eat every day, then there is"
the eating-house opposite.  But it would be better for you if you left
off that habit.  You see you are not a gentleman.  What do you eat?
"You eat yourself!"""
"For such speeches, delivered in a strictly business-like manner, and"
"always with smiling eyes, and also for the attention he paid to his"
lodgers the Captain was very popular among the poor of the town.  It
"very often happened that a former client of his would appear, not in"
"rags, but in something more respectable and with a slightly happier"
face.
"""Good-day, your honour, and how do you do?"""
"""Alive, in good health!  Go on."""
"""Don't you know me?"""
"""I did not know you."""
"""Do you remember that I lived with you last winter for nearly a month"
".... when the fight with the police took place, and three were taken"
"away?"""
"""My brother, that is so.  The police do come even under my hospitable"
"Then Alice added, ""And even if it weren't for the hundred per, he isn't"
"the kind to kill himself."""
"Andrews grunted, ""No, he isn't. But Alice, I'm not at all sure that"
"Norton knows whether he's doing the right thing or not."""
"She shook her head. There was no answer to that argument. Furthermore,"
it was the kind of unresolvable argument that could go on and on until
the answer was supplied from the outside. There could be no end to it
until they were either picked up safely or died in lonely space.
"She decided to drop the discussion as pointless, so headed for the"
bathroom. A hot shower and a quick tubbing of her underclothing were
"on her mind. Her garments, of course, would dry instantly. She had"
to smile a little. To think that a hundred years ago women thought
something they called nylon was wonderful because it was fairly
"quick-drying! Not instantaneous, of course, as was the material of"
which her lingerie was made.
"Anyhow, getting it clean now, and having a bath herself would make"
her feel better. And she would be better equipped to face the
nerve-gruelling business of just sitting there watching the clock go
"around and around, with nothing to do but wait."
VII
"Regin Naylo faced his superior with a scowl. ""That rips it wide open,"""
he said.
"""It's more 'n I did,"" returned the Girl, evenly, and bolted the door."
"""Do you think I'd want to shield a man who tried to rob me?"" she asked,"
facing him.
"Ignoring the question, Rance removed the glove of his weaponless hand"
and strode to the curtains that enclosed the Girl's bed and parted them.
When he turned back he was met by a scornful look and the words:
"""So, you doubt me, do you? Well, go on--search the place. But this ends"
your acquaintance with The Polka. Don't you ever speak to me again.
"We're through."""
Suddenly there came a smothered groan from the man in the loft; Rance
"wheeled round quickly and brought up his gun, demanding:"
"""What's that? What's that?"""
Leaning against the bureau the Girl laughed outright and declared that
the Sheriff was becoming as nervous as an old woman. Her ridicule was
"not without its effect, and, presently, Rance uncocked his gun and"
replaced it in its holster. Advancing now to the table where the Girl
"was standing, he took off his cap and shook it before laying it down;"
"then, pointing to the door, his eyes never leaving the Girl's face, he"
went on accusingly:
"""I saw someone standing out there against the snow. I fired. I could"
"have sworn it was a man."""
The Girl winced. But as she stood watching him calmly remove his coat
"and shake it with the air of one determined to make himself at home, she"
cried out tauntingly:
Already they could hear the footsteps of the officers.
"""I'll take a chance. Good-bye."""
There was no time even for a hand-shake; Fraser stepped swiftly to the
"door, then strolled quietly out into the view of the two men, who an"
instant later accosted him.
"""Are you Mr. Boyd Emerson?"""
"The adventurer answered brusquely, ""Yes, but I can't talk to you now."""
"""You are under arrest, Mr. Emerson."""
Boyd waited to hear no more. The glass door swung open noiselessly
"under his hand, and he stepped out just as the bill-clerk looked up"
"from his work, staring out through the other entrance."
"""Fingerless"" Fraser's voice was louder now, as if for a signal. ""Arrest"
"me? What do you mean? Get out of my way."""
"""You'd better come peaceably."""
"Boyd heard a sharp exclamation--""Get him, Bill!"" And then the sound of"
"men struggling. He ran, followed by a roar from the strikers, in whose"
full view Fraser's encounter with the plain-clothes men was taking
place. A backward glance showed him that Fraser had drawn his pursuers
"to the street. He had broken away and dodged out into the open, where"
the other officers responded at a call and seized him as he apparently
undertook to break through the cordon. This diversion served an
unexpected purpose. Not only did it draw attention from Emerson's
"retreat, but it also gave the mob its long-awaited opportunity."
"""That's my business!"" came like a knife-cut from the Girl."
"""Do you know you're talkin' to the Sheriff?"""
"""I'm talkin' to Jack Rance, the gambler,"" she amended evenly."
"""You're right,--and he's just fool enough to take you up,"" returned"
Rance with sudden decision. He looked around him for a chair; there was
"one near the table, and the Girl handed it to him. With one hand he"
"swung it into place before the table, while with the other he jerked off"
"the table-cover, and flung it across the room. Johnson neither moved nor"
"groaned, as the edge slid from beneath his nerveless arms."
"""You and the cyards have got into my blood. I'll take you up,"" he said,"
seating himself.
"""Your word,"" demanded the Girl, leaning over the table, but still"
standing.
"""I can lose like a gentleman,"" returned Rance curtly; then, with a swift"
"seizure of her hand, he continued tensely, in tones that made the Girl"
"shrink and whiten, ""I'm hungry for you, Min, and if I win, I'll take it"
"out on you as long as I have breath."""
"A moment later, the Girl had freed her hand from his clasp, and was"
"saying evenly, ""Fix the lamp."" And while the Sheriff was adjusting the"
"wick that had begun to flare up smokily, she swiftly left the room,"
saying casually over her shoulder that she was going to fetch something
from the closet.
"""What you goin' to get?"" he called after her suspiciously. The Girl made"
torrent of rain beat upon the Frangipani's streaming face; he tottered
"on his knees, but still held his hands to the heavens."
"""They lied,"" he cried. ""Give me but life.""--"
The duke looked at him and heaved up his sword.
"Giovanni Frangipani saw the white face above him, gave a great cry and"
cowered behind his hands. It was all ended in a moment. The rain
washed his gilded harness as he lay with his blood soaking into the
crevices of the rocks.--
Francesco had witnessed neither the fight nor the ending. Impelled by
"an insensate desire to find Raniero, to have a final reckoning for all"
"the baseness and insults he had heaped upon him in the past, for his"
"treachery and cruelty to Ilaria, he had made his way to the great"
hall.
The door was closed and locked from within.
Francesco dealt it a terrific blow. Its shattered framework heaved
inward and toppled against the wall.
In the doorway stood Raniero and looked out at his opponent. He did
not recognize Francesco. His face was sullen; the glitter of his
little eyes mimicked the ring gleams of his hauberk. He put out the
tip of a tongue and moistened his lips.
Francesco's face was as the face of a man who has but one purpose left
"in life and, that accomplished, cares not what happens. Raising his"
"vizor, he said:"
Thursday 2:28 P.M.
"""The hypersonic test flight must proceed as scheduled,"" Tanzan Mino"
"said quietly. ""Now that all the financial arrangements have been"
"completed, the Coordinating Committee of the LDP has agreed to bring"
"the treaty before the Diet next week. A delay is unthinkable."""
"""The problem is not technical, Mino-sama,"" Taro Ikeda, the project"
"director, continued, his tone ripe with deference. ""It is the Soviet"
"pilot. Perhaps he should be replaced."" He looked down, searching for"
"the right words. ""I'm concerned. I think he has discovered the stealth"
"capabilities of the vehicle. Probably accidentally, but all the same,"
I'm convinced he is now aware of them. Two nights ago he engaged in
certain unauthorized maneuvers I believe were intended to verify those
"capabilities."""
"""_So deshoo_."" Tanzan Mino's eyes narrowed. ""But he has said nothing?"""
"""No. Not a word. At least to me."""
"""Then perhaps he was merely behaving erratically. It would not be the"
"first time."""
"""The maneuvers. They were too explicit,"" Ikeda continued. ""As I said,"
"two nights ago, on the last test fight, he switched off the"
"transponder, then performed a snap roll and took the vehicle into a"
"power dive, all the way to the deck. It was intended to be a radar-"
"evasive action."" The project director allowed himself a faint, ironic"
"smile. ""At least we now know that the technology works. The vehicle's"
thought that she had been unjust was iron through Mrs. Carmichael's
"soul, for above all things she prided herself on her fairness. She"
pushed her work away and went over to Beatrice's side. Mrs. Cary's
"head still rested against the aching shoulder, and Mrs. Carmichael"
made a sign to let her improvize a cushion substitute. Beatrice shook
her head.
"""No, thank you,"" she whispered, glancing down at the flushed, sleeping"
"face. ""We have done each other so little real service that I am glad"
to be able to do even this much. I don't suppose it will be for long.
"How quiet everything is!"""
Mrs. Carmichael looked at the clock on the writing-table.
"""It is not yet midnight,"" she said. ""Probably the Rajah is keeping his"
"promise."" Her expression relaxed a little. ""Don't tire yourself,"" she"
"added bruskly to Mrs. Berry, who had been fanning the unconscious"
"woman's face with an improvized paper fan. ""I don't think she feels"
"the heat."""
The missionary's wife continued her good work with redoubled energy.
It was perhaps one of the few really unselfish things which she had
"ever done in the course of a pious but fundamentally selfish life, and"
it gave her pleasure and courage. The knowledge that some one was
weaker than herself and needed her was new strength to her new-born
heroism.
"""It is so frightfully hot,"" she said half apologetically. ""Why isn't"
"the punkah-man at work?"""
"""The 'punkah-man' has bolted with the rest of them,"" Mrs. Carmichael"
"answered. ""I dare say I could work it, though I have never tried."""
"lately?"""
"""Very well, I believe. The men were down the other day, and told me it"
"was a big thing."""
"""I'm delighted. How does it seem, to be rich?"""
There was the slightest hint of constraint in the girl's voice as she
"stared out at the slowly gathering twilight, murmuring:"
"""I--I hardly know. Rich! That has always been my dream, and yet--"""
"""The wonderful feature about dreams,"" he took advantage of her pause to"
"say, ""is that they come true."""
"""Not all of them--not the real, wonderful dreams,"" she returned."
"""Oh yes! My dream is coming true, and so is yours."""
"""I have given up hoping for that,"" she said, without turning."
"""But you shouldn't give up. Remember that all the great things ever"
"accomplished were only dreams at first, and the greater the"
"accomplishments, the more impossible they seemed to begin with."""
Something in the girl's attitude and in her silence made him feel that
"his words rang hollow and commonplace. While they had talked, an"
"unaccustomed excitement had been mounting in his brain, and it held him"
now in a kind of delicious embarrassment. It was as if both had been
"suddenly enfolded in a new and mysterious understanding, without the"
need of speech. He did not tell himself that Cherry loved him; but he
"roused to a fresh perception of her beauty, and felt himself privileged"
"Dagoes, and Dutchmen and Calashees, I'd 'ave showed you and Salisbury"
"'ow to 'andle mixed sweets.  Vig'lance, difficulties, bright"
"look-out, and the rule o' the road.  And look at the chart!  That's"
"me!"""
"And very shortly afterwards the triple conversation ceased, for the"
captain lay snoring in his cabin.
"The _Potluck_ was a barque of eleven hundred tons' register, and was"
"bound for Adelaide, with a general cargo of all mixed things under"
heaven and on earth.  Now she was engaged in running down her
"easting, and, as her skipper believed, was somewhere about Lat. 44°"
"30' S., Long. 50° E., and not far off the Crozets.  The westerly"
"winds were blowing hard, but had the worst chill of winter off, for"
"the month was September.  Nevertheless, as old Jones, the skipper,"
"was on a composite track, with a maximum latitude of 45° S., and was"
bound farther south still it might have been to the advantage of all
"concerned if he had drunk less, talked little, and minded his own"
business instead of arguing foreign politics.
But to each man Fate often gives his chance of proving what he boasts
to be his particular skill in the universe.
"When Lampert relieved Simcox at midnight, the weather was thick, and"
"neither man's temper was of the sweetest, so they had a bit of a"
breeze.
"""What kind of a relief d'ye call this?' growled Simcox."
"""I call it a very good relief,"" replied Lampert, ""and a darned sight"
"better one than you deserve.  You owe me ten minutes even now."""
then! I felt that I had become a different being altogether.
The boat entered the harbour and ran alongside the quay. A train was
waiting for us. We poured out of the ship in two streams that spread out
fan-wise and flowed into the carriages.
It was good to sit by the window in a comfortable compartment and lean
back against soft cushions.
Glad anticipation and barely suppressed excitement were visible on
everybody's face.
"The train sped through familiar country: meadows, pastures, cornfields,"
orchards and woodlands. People waved their handkerchiefs at us from
cottage windows.
It was growing dark as the first rows of drab suburban houses began to
glide past.
So this was London. I stared out of the window and tried to grasp the
"tremendous, wonderful fact with all the power of my mind. Somehow or"
"other it did not seem real, but I felt I could make it real by an effort"
of the will.
Streets and houses and moving people soon crowded the whole view. The
people filled me with intense curiosity. I longed to talk to them and
find out what they felt and thought about the war.
We entered Victoria Station. I opened the door of the compartment with
"hasty, trembling hands. I did not wait to change my French money, but"
hurried out into a street and got on to a 'bus.

"be in the mornin'. You'll see in the mornin' that there'll be--"" She"
"stopped and stared in frozen terror at the sinister face of the Sheriff,"
who was coolly watching his handkerchief turn from white to red under
the slow rain of blood from the loft above.
"""Oho!"" he emitted sardonically, stepping back and pointing his gun"
"towards the loft. ""So, he's up there!"""
"The Girl's fingers clutched his arm, dragging desperately."
"""No, he isn't, Jack--no, he isn't!"" she iterated in blind, mechanical"
denial.
"With an abrupt movement, Rance flung her violently from him, made a grab"
"at the suspended ladder and lowered it into position; then, deaf to the"
"Girl's pleadings, harshly ordered Johnson to come down, meanwhile"
covering the source of the blood-drops with his gun.
"""Oh, wait,--wait a minute!"" begged the Girl helplessly. What would"
happen if he couldn't obey the summons? He had spent himself in his
"climb to safety. Perhaps he was unconscious, slowly bleeding to death!"
"But even as she tortured herself with fears, the boards above creaked as"
though a heavy body was dragging itself slowly across them. Johnson was
evidently doing his best to reach the top of the ladder; but he did not
move quickly enough to suit the Sheriff.
"""Come down, or I'll--"""
"""Oh, just a minute, Jack, just a minute!"" broke in the Girl frantically."
"""Don't shoot!--Don't you see he's tryin' to--?"""
"""Come down here, Mr. Johnson!"" reiterated the Sheriff, with a face"
"no reply. Rance made no movement to follow her, but instead drew a pack"
of cards from his pocket and began to shuffle them with practiced
carelessness. But when a minute had passed and the girl had not
"returned, he called once more, with growing impatience, to know what was"
keeping her.
"""I'm jest gettin' the cards an' kind o' steadyin' my nerves,"" she"
answered somewhat queerly through the doorway. The next moment she had
"returned, quickly closing the closet door behind her, blew out her"
"candle, and laying a pack of cards upon the table, said significantly:"
"""We'll use a fresh deck. There's a good deal depends on this, Jack."" She"
seated herself opposite the Sheriff and so close to the unconscious form
of the man she loved that from time to time her left arm brushed his
shoulder.
"Rance, without protest other than a shrug, took up his own deck of"
"cards, wrapped them in a handkerchief, and stowed them away in his"
pocket. It was the Girl who spoke first:
"""Are you ready?"""
"""Ready? Yes. I'm ready. Cut for deal."""
"With unfaltering fingers, the Girl cut. Of the man beside her, dead or"
"dying, she must not, dared not think. For the moment she had become one"
"incarnate purpose: to win, to win at any cost,--nothing else mattered."
"Rance won the deal; and taking up the pack he asked, as he shuffled:"
"""A case of show-down?"""
either.
"""Curious!"" he ejaculated.  ""Very curious indeed!"""
"""What is curious?""  I inquired eagerly."
"""Those marks,"" he answered, indicating them with his finger.  ""They are"
"very puzzling.  I've never seen such marks before."""
"""Do they point to foul play?""  I inquired, feeling suspicious that she"
had by some mysterious means fallen the victim of an assassin.
"""Well, no,"" he responded, after some hesitation; ""that is not my"
"opinion."""
"""Then what is your opinion?"""
"""At present I have none.  I can have none until I make a thorough"
"examination.  There are certainly no outward marks of violence."""
"""We need not inform the police, I suppose?"""
"""Not at present,"" he replied, his eyes still fixed upon the blanched"
face of the woman who had once been all the world to me.
"I raised her dead hand, and upon it imprinted a last fervent kiss.  It"
was cold and clammy to my lips.  In that hour all my old love for her
"had returned, and my heart had become filled with an intense bitterness"
"and desolation.  I had thought that all my love for her was dead, and"
"that Edith Austin, the calm, sweet woman far away in an English county,"
"who wrote to me daily from her quiet home deep in the woodlands, had"
"taken her place.  But our meeting and its tragic sequel had, I admit,"
breakwater.
"The skipper, who had been lying flat when the others jumped for the"
"main deck, got up and crawled forward to the break of the poop.  He"
was half-paralysed with a mixture of funk and rage.  He addressed
"himself and his remarks to the sky, the sea, and the island, but"
above all to Lampert.
"""You man-drowning, slop-built caricature of a sailorman, what 'ave"
"you bin and done with my ship?"" he bellowed.  ""Oh, Lord, I'm a ruined"
"man; by gosh, I'll murder you!"""
"He tumbled down on the main deck and made for Lampert, who easily"
dodged him.
"""Shut up, you old idiot!"" said the mate contemptuously.  ""Who but me"
"told you that if you drove her in thick weather, and no sun seen for"
"a week, you'd pile her up?"""
Simcox caught Jones and held him.
"""Good lord, sir,"" said the second greaser, ""it's no time to fight."""
"""No, it ain't,"" said Jack Hart boldly."
"That a foremast hand should dare to shove his oar in, almost cowed"
the poor old Guffin.  It was something out of nature.
"""It ain't no time for jawbation,"" insisted Hart, about whom the"
"others had gathered.  ""It's time for thinkin' out the politics of the"
"situation, and if I'm not mistaken we shall be able to walk ashore by"
"the morning, and there won't be no ship for any one to command--so"
"bought Lilly, body and soul--with promises."" The king shrugged his"
"shoulders and whispered: ""With promises, you understand, Baron Ned, with"
"promises. Now give him a chance at the Abbé."""
"Charles laughed and chuckled in self-gratulation, not the least"
suspecting that he was talking to the wrong man and playing into the
French king's hand. I bore in mind the fact that the king had bought
"Lilly with promises, and I determined to buy the good Doctor with ready"
gold.
"""I'll try to carry out your Majesty's commands,"" I answered, apparently"
"doubtful of my ability. ""But of course you would not have me insist, if"
"the Abbé seems disinclined to consult Lilly."""
"""No, no! Odds fish, man, no! But find a way to bring them together,"
"and your reward will come later. I choose, you for this little piece of"
business because you are in no way connected with the affair between the
"French king and me, and because I know you are to be trusted."""
I to be trusted! So was Brutus!
"""I shall do my best, your Majesty, and if I fail, I shall notify you at"
"once,"" I said, taking my leave."
"I hastened to De Grammont's house, which at that time was over near the"
"Mall, and told the count what the king had said."
"""Ah, that is good!"" cried De Grammont. ""A fool, who knows himself to be a"
"fool, is likely to be wary, but one who deems himself wise is the easiest"
"dupe in the world. I'll see Monsieur l'Abbé. Wait."""
"De Grammont returned in a few minutes, saying that the Abbé would go with"
XXVII
"A large house, with and upper story of planks built on later, displayed a"
"new signboard on the wall: Room and Board. The barn, as usual, was a peat"
hut.
"As I did not know which was Eilert and which Olaus, and had stopped to"
"consider which road to take, a man came hurrying toward me. Ah, well, the"
world is a small place; we meet friends and acquaintances everywhere. Here
"am I, meeting an old acquaintance, the thief of last winter, the pork"
"thief. What luck, what a satisfaction!"
This was Eilert. He took in paying guests now.
"At first he pretended not to recognize me, but he soon gave that up. Once"
"he had done so, however, he carried the thing off in style:"
"""Well, well,"" he said, ""what a nice surprise! You are most welcome under"
"my humble roof, and such it is!"""
"My own response was rather less jaunty, and I stood still collecting my"
"thoughts. When I had asked a few questions, he explained that since the"
"motor traffic had started in Stordalen, many visitors came through this"
"way, and sometimes they wanted to stop over at his house before being"
"rowed across to the steamer. They always came down in the evenings, and it"
"might be fine, or it might not, and at night the fjord was often wild. He"
"had therefore had to arrange to house them, because after all, you can't"
"neither she nor I cared to go, we should take the letters to Dover, cross"
"to Calais, and post them in France."
"I sprang at the idea, but immediately sprang back, saying: ""But it is not"
"entirely proper for us to travel to Calais together, even though you are"
"my sister-cousin."""
"""We may take father,"" she suggested. ""Sarah wants to visit Lady St."
"Albans, and she can go if we take father with us. And, Baron Ned; I have"
"another suggestion to offer. Let us take Bettina."""
I sprang at that proposal and did not spring back. So we went first to my
"uncle, who said he would go with us, and then we went to see Bettina. She"
"had recovered from her sprains and bruises, although she was still pale"
and not quite strong.
"When Frances asked her to go with us, she answered, ""Ay, gladly, if"
"father consents."""
"Pickering, who was sitting with us at the time in Bettina's cozy parlor,"
"turned to me, laughing, and said:--"
"""You would suppose, from Betty's remark, that I am master here, but the"
"truth is my soul is not my own, and now her modest request for permission"
"is made for effect on the company."""
"Betty ran to her father, sat on his knee, twined her arm about his neck,"
and kissed him as a protest against the unjust insinuation.
"""You see how she does it,"" said Pickering. ""No hammer and tongs for"
"Betty; just oil and honey."""
instant he fell full length on the boarded floor of the loft with the
hand outstretched in which was the handkerchief he had been staunching
the blood from the wound in his side.
With a whispered injunction that he was all right and was not to move on
"any account, the Girl put the ladder back in its place. But no sooner"
was this done than on looking up she caught sight of the stained
"handkerchief. She called softly up to him to take it away, explaining"
that the cracks between the boards were wide and it could plainly be
seen from below.
"""That's it!"" she exclaimed on observing that he had changed the position"
"of his hand. ""Now, don't move!"""
"Finally, with the lighted candle in her hand, the Girl made a quick"
survey of the room to see that nothing was in sight that would betray
"her lover's presence there, and then throwing open the door she took up"
such a position by it that it made it impossible for anyone to get past
her without using force.
"""You can't come in here, Jack Rance,"" she said in a resolute voice. ""You"
"can tell me what you want from where you are."""
"Roughly, almost brutally, Rance shoved her to one side and entered."
"""No more Jack Rance. It's the Sheriff coming after Mr. Johnson,"" he"
"said, emphasizing each word."
The Girl eyed him defiantly.
"""Yes, I said Mr. Johnson,"" reiterated the Sheriff, cocking the gun that"
"he held in his hand. ""I saw him coming in here."""
"""What are your plans of escape?"" I asked."
"""I shall work my way down to Sheerness, where I hope to find a boat"
"for The Hague or the French coast. Lilly, who seems to know everything,"
"past, present and future, came last night to tell me that the king has"
"fifty men seeking me in various parts of England, especially the"
"seaports, and has offered a reward of two hundred pounds for me, dead"
"or alive, preferably dead, I suppose. If I go direct to Sheerness and try"
"to take a boat, I am sure to be examined, and I'm not prepared for the"
ordeal. So I intend to preach my way down the river and induce the king's
"officers to send me abroad by force."""
"""How are you off for money, George?"" I asked."
"""I borrowed ten guineas from Lilly,"" he answered."
"""I thought you might be in need of money, so I brought fifty guineas from"
"the strong box under my bed,"" I said, offering him the little bag of"
gold.
"He hesitated, saying: ""If I take the money, you may never again see a"
"farthing of it."""
"""In that case, I'll take my pay in abusing you,"" I replied."
"""Do you believe he would, Frances?"" asked George, turning to my cousin."
Then continuing thoughtfully:
"""It is strange that I should have found such a friend at the bottom of a"
"quarrel, all because I allowed him to abuse me. Truly forbearance is a"
"profitable virtue. The 'other cheek' is the better of the two."""
"""All right,"" Slyne repeated. ""We'll lunch at two--after they're all"
"signed. So--off you go, and get busy."""
"The stout solicitor hurried away, cowed and obedient again, and Slyne,"
"very smart in an almost new flannel suit, rejoined Captain Dove."
"""I'm _too_ fashionable, that's what's the matter with me!"" declared"
"Captain Dove with sudden conviction at sight of him, and gazed very"
bitterly at his own image in an inconvenient mirror.
"""Never mind about that,"" Slyne advised soothingly. ""It's not as if you"
"were staying here, you know. You'll be back on board your ship by"
"supper-time. And now, I must tell you how we've got to handle this"
lawyer-fellow when he fetches in the raft of papers he'll want us all to
"sign."""
"Captain Dove listened gloomily while he went on to explain, at"
"considerable length, and in his most convincing manner, that they must"
match their combined wits against the lawyer's for their own profit.
"""It's not that I don't trust him,"" said Slyne, ""but--I'll feel more"
secure after everything's settled in writing and signed. He can't go
"back on us then."""
"""He'd better not!"" Captain Dove commented. ""I'll wring his neck for him"
"if he tries--"""
"""And, as for Sallie,"" Slyne cut him short, ""I've made things quite--"""
"""Sallie will do whatever I tell her,"" growled Captain Dove. ""And don't"
you attempt to interfere between me and her--till you've paid me my
*CHAPTER IX.*
"*""A MAD WORLD, MY MASTERS.""*"
"""Master, master, wake up!  What ails you? Have you forgot the day, and"
"what has to be done?"""
"Dick, with an expression of uneasiness and determination upon his face,"
was shaking Grey somewhat vehemently by the shoulder.  The latter seemed
"to find it hard to wake; and when his eyes opened at last, there was a"
lack-lustre expression in them that was strange and unnatural.  Dick’s
honest face clouded over yet more.
"""I was certain there was some devilry afoot when they all came here last"
"night.  I have never seen my master in such a mad mood of merriment,"" he"
"muttered half aloud, as he turned away to get a brimming glass of pure"
"cold water from the table.  ""What has come over them, I don’t know.  But"
I like not the change. I liked not the look in Lord Sandford’s eyes.  He
"is a great man, I doubt it not; but I wish my master had chanced upon"
another as a friend and comrade in this great Babylon of a city.  There
"is more going on here than I well understand."""
"""What are you grumbling over there to yourself, Dicon?"" asked Grey from"
"his bed, and his voice sounded more natural and quiet than his servant"
"had heard it yet; ""and where am I?  For sure this room is strange to"
"mine eyes, nor have I any recollection of it overnight; and how come you"
"to be here, for that matter, honest Dicon?  Methought you were at"
"Hampstead, watching over Don Carlos, that he might be ready for"
"Saturday’s race."""
half a score of games were in progress at different points of the
quarry-like cauldron which formed the outlaws' rendezvous.
At once the humour of the child changed.
"""They obeyed you,"" she said; ""I like you for that. I mean to have many"
men obey me when I grow up. Then I will kill many--thousands and
"thousands. Now I can do nothing--only I have it in my head--here!"""
The elf tapped her forehead immediately underneath the red sash which
"was tied about it. The Sergeant, though eager to hear her story and"
"marvelling at such sentiments from the lips of a child, successfully"
"concealed his curiosity, and said gently, ""Tell me how you came to think"
"of to-night----"""
"""Of what to-night?"" asked the girl quickly and suspiciously."
"""The deed which is to be done to-night,"" replied the Sergeant simply, as"
though he were acquainted with the whole.
She leaped forward and caught him by the arm.
"""You will stay and go with us? You will lead us?"" she hissed, her blue"
"eyes aflame and with trembling accents, ""then indeed will I be sure of"
my revenge. Then the Italian woman and her devil's brat shall not
"escape. Then I shall be sure--sure!"""
"She repeated the last words with concentrated fury, apparently"
impossible to one of her age. The Sergeant smoked quietly and observed
her. She seemed absolutely transfigured.
"""Tell me that you will,"" she cried, low and fierce, so that her voice"
Not till he has learnt will he desire to enter into the straight road.
But in the end all men will come. We at the last shall all meet together
where Time and Life shall be no more.
This is a Burman allegory of Buddhism. It was told me long ago. I trust
I have not spoilt it in the retelling.
CHAPTER XXV
CONCLUSION
This is the end of my book. I have tried always as I wrote to remember
the principles that I laid down for myself in the first chapter. Whether
"I have always done so I cannot say. It is so difficult, so very"
"difficult, to understand a people--any people--to separate their beliefs"
"from their assents, to discover the motives of their deeds, that I fear"
I must often have failed.
My book is short. It would have been easy to make a book out of each
"chapter, to write volumes on each great subject that I have touched on;"
but I have not done so--I have always been as brief as I could.
"I have tried always to illustrate only the central thought, and not the"
"innumerable divergencies, because only so can a great or strange thought"
"be made clear. Later, when the thought is known, then it is easy to"
"stray into the byways of thought, always remembering that they are"
"byways, wandering from a great centre."
"Perhaps she had spoiled everything. Pola would come back, of course,"
"but, somehow, Pola's glamour had faded. After all, what, besides tons"
"of candy and quarts of sweet mixtures and much glitter, had there been"
to it? The sweets and the glitter and Pola's endless confidences of
"""men"" had left Sidney jaded and bored, though she did not know it; she"
did know that she was suddenly lonely for Mart and Lav and the
stimulating pastimes they seemed to find always right at hand.
"As she approached Rockman's, wandering there from force of habit, she"
"saw Lav pushing off in a dory. She ran down the wharf, hailing him."
"""Oh, Lav, take me with you!"" she pleaded, breathlessly."
He hesitated a moment before he swung the dory back to the wharf.
Something of the look Mart had given her flashed into his eyes.
"Then: ""Come on if y'want to,"" he answered ungraciously."
As she sat down in the bow of the boat Sidney wanted to cry more than
"anything else, but Lav's dark face suddenly reminded her of what Aunt"
Achsa had told her. Perhaps he had been out in the sand dunes last
"night, lying on his face, sobbing aloud! She began chattering with"
resolute cheerfulness.
"""Isn't it hot this morning, Lav? Where are you going?"" Lav answered"
shortly that he was going out to the _Arabella_. Sidney noticed a book
"in his pocket, but said nothing. She ventured other remarks concerning"
"the activities in the bay to which Lavender answered in monosyllables,"
if at all.
"""Oh, look, the _Puritan's_ in, Lav!"" And even to this Lavender only"
"found him. He didn't come down in the morning, and, as she couldn't make"
"him hear, she forced the door, and found him with his throat cut."""
"""Awful!"" shuddered Lady Eynesford. ""He looked such a respectable man"
"too."""
"""Ah, I fancy he'd gone a bit to the bad lately--taken to drinking and so"
"on."""
"""He was a friend of Mr. Kilshaw's, wasn't he?"" asked Alicia."
"""A sort of hanger-on, I think. Anyhow, there he was dead, and with his"
"pockets empty."""
"""Perhaps he killed himself,"" she suggested."
"""They think not. They've arrested the woman, but she declares she knows"
"nothing about it!"""
"""Poor man!"" said Alicia; and, at another time, she might have thought a"
good deal about the horrible end of a man whom she had known as an
"acquaintance. But, as it was, she soon forgot him again, and, leaving"
"the rest, returned to her solitary seat."
"In the town, the news of the murder was but one ruffle more on the wave"
"of excitement, and not a very marked one. Few people knew Benham's"
"name, and when the first agitation following on the discovery of the"
"body died away and the onlookers found there was no news to be had, they"
turned away to join the processions or to stare at them. The police were
"left to pursue their investigations in peace, and they soon reached a"
"conclusion. The landlady of the house where Benham died lived alone,"
save for the occasional presence of her son: he was away at work in an
me. Will you see that Buster is sent up to my laboratory immediately?”
She nodded. It was evident that Buster was a great pet with her and
that it was with difficulty she kept from smoothing his silky coat.
“You—you won’t hurt Buster?” she pleaded.
"“No. Trust me. More than that, if there is any possible way of"
"untangling this mystery, I shall do it.”"
"Mrs. Blake looked rather than spoke her thanks. As we went downstairs,"
"accompanied by Miss Sears, we could see in the music room a very"
"interesting couple, chatting earnestly over the piano."
"Betty Blake, a slip of a girl in her first season, was dividing her"
attention between her visitor and the door by which we were passing.
"She rose as she heard us, leaving the young man standing alone at the"
piano. He was of an age perhaps a year or two older than Reginald
"Blake. It was evident that, whatever Miss Betty might think, he had"
eyes for no one else but the pretty debutante. He even seemed to be
"regarding Kennedy sullenly, as if he were a possible rival."
"“You—you don’t think it is serious?” whispered Betty in an undertone,"
scarcely waiting to be introduced. She had evidently known of our
"visit, but had been unable to get away to be present upstairs."
"“Really, Miss Blake,” reassured Kennedy, “I can’t say. All I can do is"
to repeat what I have already said to your mother. Keep up a good heart
and trust me to work it out.”
"“Thank you,” she murmured, and then, impulsively extending her small"
"""You must not stop here,"" he said. ""You have frightened us all"
terribly. The regiment has come and is attacking. There will be some
"desperate fighting. We must all stick together."""
She caught Nicholson's eyes resting on her. She thought she read pity
"and sympathy in their steady depths, and wondered if he guessed what"
"she had tried to do. But he said nothing, and she followed the two men"
blindly and indifferently back to the bungalow.
CHAPTER X
TRAVERS
"They had no light. They talked in whispers, and now and again, when"
"the darkness grew too oppressive, they stretched out groping hands and"
touched each other. They did this without explanation. Though none
"complained or spoke of fear, each needed the consolation of the"
"other's company, and a touch was worth more than words. Mrs. Cary"
alone needed nothing. She lay on the rough truckle-bed and slept. Thus
she had been for a week--a whole week of nerve-wrecking struggle
against odds which marked hope as vain. Bullets had beaten like rain
"upon the walls about her, the moaning of wounded men on the other side"
of the hastily constructed partition mingled unceasingly with the
cries of the ever-nearing enemy. And she had lain there quiet and
"indifferent. Martins, the regiment's doctor, had looked in once at her"
"and had shaken his head. ""In all probability she will never wake,"" he"
"had said. ""Perhaps it is the kindest thing that could happen to her."""
difficulties personally had produced an unexpected dividend.
"""As you say, _Mino-sama_,"" Ikeda bowed. ""I merely wanted to make you"
aware of my concern about the pilot. He should be monitored more
"closely from now on."""
"""Which is precisely what I intend to do."" Tanzan Mino's silver hair"
"seemed to blend with the sea beyond. ""There is an obvious solution."
"When he takes the vehicle hypersonic, he will not be alone."""
"""What are you suggesting? No one else--"""
"""Merely a simple security precaution. If he is not reliable, then steps"
"must be taken. Two of our people will be in the cockpit with him."""
"""You mean the scientists from Tsukuba? The cockpit was designed to"
"accommodate a three-man crew, but MITI hasn't yet designated the two"
"researchers."""
"""No. I mean my personal pilot and copilot. From the Boeing. Then if"
"Androv deviates from the prescribed test program in any way, they will"
"be there, ready to take immediate action. The problem is solved."" He"
"revolved back from the window. ""That will be all."""
"Ikeda bowed, then turned and hurriedly made his way toward the door. He"
"didn't like last-minute improvisations, but the CEO was now fully in"
command. Preparations for two additional life-support systems would
have to be started immediately.
"After Tanzan Mino watched him depart, he reached down and activated a"
line of personal video monitors beside his desk.
"""Frankly, I haven't had time to read them. However, I think there is"
little doubt as to the mood of my people. They will be indignant and
"angry at Washington bungling."""
He pointed to another hand.
"""Senator, granting the details you outlined are accurate, have you any"
"knowledge as to--"""
"""Young man. _Every_ detail I outlined was completely accurate."" Senator"
Crane withered the reporter with a hostile look and pointed elsewhere.
"""Senator, did you consult with the people responsible for handling the"
"situation before making your speech?"""
"""I tried. I was willing to co-operate in every way, but my patience ran"
"out. Also, I was alarmed at the bungling and inefficiency I saw. For"
"that reason I went straight to the people with my story."""
"""Senator, I have a wire from the governor of your state. It just arrived"
in response to my query as to his attitude on this affair. The governor
"says, quote, _No comment_, unquote. Would _you_ care to comment on his"
"statement?"""
Senator Crane thought he heard a faint ripple of mirth drift across the
"room. But, of course, he had to be mistaken. ""I think the governor"

"The girl looked quickly up into Chandler’s clear, pleasant countenance."
"Her eyes twinkled once very brightly, and then she smiled ingenuously."
"“But we don’t know each other—it wouldn’t be right, would it?” she"
"said, doubtfully."
"“There is nothing wrong about it,” said the young man, candidly. “I’ll"
"introduce myself—permit me—Mr. Towers Chandler. After our dinner, which"
"I will try to make as pleasant as possible, I will bid you"
"good-evening, or attend you safely to your door, whichever you prefer.”"
"“But, dear me!” said the girl, with a glance at Chandler’s faultless"
attire. “In this old dress and hat!”
"“Never mind that,” said Chandler, cheerfully. “I’m sure you look more"
charming in them than any one we shall see in the most elaborate dinner
toilette.”
"“My ankle does hurt yet,” admitted the girl, attempting a limping step."
"“I think I will accept your invitation, Mr. Chandler. You may call"
me—Miss Marian.”
"“Come then, Miss Marian,” said the young architect, gaily, but with"
perfect courtesy; “you will not have far to walk. There is a very
respectable and good restaurant in the next block. You will have to
lean on my arm—so—and walk slowly. It is lonely dining all by one’s

"I gave him my hand for answer, and told him I would bring Frances to him"
early the following morning.
"I hastened back to Whitehall, and coming upon Frances unengaged, asked"
"her to go to her parlor with me. When she had closed the door, she turned"
"to me, asking:--"
"""What is it, Baron Ned? Tell me quickly. I know there is something wrong"
"with George."""
"""Will you go with me early to-morrow morning to see Betty--very early?"""
I asked.
"Her eyes opened in wonder, and she answered, somewhat amused: ""You have"
"been acting as my guardian for a long time, cousin Ned, and now I think I"
owe it to you to return the favor. You should not see so much of Betty. I
"know you mean no wrong to her, but you will cause her great suffering if"
"you continue to see her, for you must know that already the girl is"
"almost mad with love of you. Yet you cannot marry her."""
"""Nor can you marry some one else,"" I retorted, almost angrily, for a man"
dislikes to be prodded by a painful truth.
"""Ah, well, I suppose we are a pair of fools,"" she said."
"""You're right, Frances,"" I answered philosophically, ""and the only"
"settled his saucer on the _tatami _and looked up. ""Of course, any"

serve as a tutorial. To remind you and others how upsetting I find
"intrusions into my affairs."""
"""Then how about starting off this 'tutorial' with a look at your new"
"plane?"" Vance glanced around. ""Guess I should call it _Daedalus_."""
"""_Daedalus I _and_ II. _There actually are two prototypes, although"
only one is currently certified to operate in the hypersonic regime.
"Yes, I expected the _Daedalus_ would intrigue you. You are a man of"
"insatiable intellectual appetite."""
"""I'm not sure that's necessarily a compliment."""
"""It wasn't necessarily meant to be. Sometimes curiosity needs to be"

"you a personal tour, to satisfy that curiosity. You are a man who can"
well appreciate both my technological achievement and my strategic

"The old boy's finally gone off the deep end, Vance told himself."

"explanation, but he had taken a couple of his big strides and was in"
"the control section with Sis. She didn't give ground, though; I'll say"
"that for her. She only came to his chest, but she had her arms crossed"
sternly.

He opened his mouth to its maximum width and raised an enormous hand.
Then he let the air out and dropped his arm.
"""I take it you either have no defense or care to make none,"" Sis added"
caustically.
Butt laughed slowly and carefully as if he were going over each word.
"""Wonder if all the anura talk like that. And _you_ want to foul up"
"Venus."""
"""We haven't done so badly on Earth, after the mess you men made of"
"politics. It needed a revolution of the mothers before--"""
"""Needed nothing. Everyone wanted peace. Earth is a weary old world."""
"""It's a world of strong moral fiber compared to yours, Mr. Alberta Lee"

"""All this may have been coincidence, Breck, but we'll find out pretty"

"the center block of the screen."""
"When he plugged in W41 was on the block, but was in the extreme upper"
right corner. They checked in thirteen and eight-tenths seconds minus on
"the station, and a fiery dialogue ensued when the computer questioned"
the accuracy of the location of the station and refused point-blank to
correct his course.
"""Not I, my friend, I have robbed you enough."""
"""And about time for the luck to turn, isn't it? Well, I don't care! What"
"shall we do?"""
"""What you will,"" answered the Frenchman absently."
"Benham pulled his beard, then leant forward and put a question with an"
intoxicated leer. A laugh of feigned reproof burst from Gaspard. Benham
"seemed to urge him, and at last he said,"
"""Oh, if you're bent on it, I can be your guide."""
"The two men left the house arm-in-arm, went down the street, and crossed"
"Digby Square. It was late, and few people were about, but Gaspard saw"
"one acquaintance. The doorkeeper was strolling along on his way home,"
"""I'm not suicidal."" He stepped back as Vera proceeded to pat them down."
"""I think very carefully about my options."""
"""Get the money."" She was directing the two remaining _Mino-gumi kobun"
_toward the table.
"""Gonna just rob the bank now, Comrade?"" Vance turned and looked at her,"
then at the three bodies strewn on the floor. The _kobun _seemed to
consider their late colleagues merely casualties of war. The dead men
"received almost no notice. ""Pretty costly little enterprise, wouldn't"
you say. Not a very propitious start for your new era of world
"serenity."""
"""You would be advised to shut up,"" she responded sharply."
"""I feel personally violated by all this."" Nogami had turned to her and"
"his voice was like steel. ""As of this moment, you can put out of your"
mind any illusion I might cooperate further. This outrage is beyond
"acceptability."""
"""We did what had to be done,"" Vera said. ""We still expect your"
"cooperation and I do not think we will be disappointed."""
"""Then your expectation is sadly misplaced,"" he replied icily. His eyes"
signified he meant every word.
"""We will see."" She dismissed him as she turned her attention to the"
money. The two _kobun_ had carefully removed their shiny black leather
jackets now and laid them on the table. Underneath they wore tightly
"tailored white shirts, complete with underarm holsters containing 9mm"
"Llamas. The automatics were back in their briefcases, positioned by the"
"""Dex!"" he cried. ""We're moving! And the motor is shut off!"""
"""We're drawing down closer to the ground, too,"" announced Dex,"
"pointing to their altimeter. ""Our altitude has been reduced five"
"thousand feet in the last two minutes."""
"Quickly Brand turned on the motor in reverse. The space ship, as the"
"rushing, reddish ground beneath indicated, continued to glide forward"
as though pulled by an invisible rope. He turned on full power. The
ship's progress was checked a little. A very little! And the metallic
red surface under them grew nearer as they steadily lost altitude.
"""Something seems to have got us by the nose,"" said Dex. ""We're on our"
"way to the center of the red spot, I guess--to find whatever it was"
that Journeyman found. And the radio communication his been broken
"somehow...."""
"Wordlessly, they stared out the panel, while the shell, quivering with"
the strain of the atomic motor's fight against whatever unseen force
"it was that relentlessly drew them forward, bore them swiftly toward"
the heart of the vast crimson area.
*       *       *       *       *
"""Look!"" cried Brand."
"For over an hour the ship had been propelled swiftly, irresistibly"
toward the center of the red spot. It had been up about forty thousand
"feet. Now, with a jerk that sent both men reeling, it had been drawn"
down to within fifteen thousand feet of the surface; and the sight
that was now becoming more and more visible was incredible.
"""I wait for you!"""
Raniero broke into a boisterous laugh.
"""The bastard! The monk! Go home, Francesco, and don your lady's"
"attire! What would you with a sword?"""
Francesco's mouth was a hard line. He breathed through hungry
"nostrils, as he went step by step toward Raniero."
Then with a swift shifting of his sword from right to left he smote
"him on each cheek, then, lowering his vizor, he put up his guard."
"With an oath Raniero's sword flashed, feinted, turned with a cunning"
"twist, and swept low for Francesco's thigh."
"Francesco leaped back, but was slashed by the point a hair's breadth"
"above the knee. It was a mere skin wound, but the pain of it seemed to"
snap something that had been twisted to a breaking point within him.
He gave a great cry and charged down Raniero's second blow.
"Their shields met and clashed, and Raniero staggered. Francesco rushed"
him across the hall as a bull drives a rival about a yard. Raniero
"crashed against the wall, and Francesco sprang back to use his sword."
The blow hewed the top from Raniero's shield and smote him slant-wise
across the face.
"Raniero gathered himself and struck back, but the blow was caught on"
"Francesco's shield. Francesco thrust at him, before he could recover,"
and the point slipped under the edge of Raniero's gorget. He twisted
free and blundered forward into a fierce exchange of half-arm blows.
"Once he struck Francesco upon the mouth with the pommel of his sword,"
"""She may be able to do so,"" answered the Abbé, shrugging his shoulders."
"He spoke very bad English throughout the consultation. ""But the stars,"
"too, may be very persuasive with King Charles. To be plain, he will"
"probably consult you, and if--"""
"""I am to see him to-night. That is why your visit was postponed until"
"to-morrow,"" interrupted Lilly."
"""That is as I supposed,"" remarked the Abbé. ""Now, if I buy Dunkirk for"
"one hundred thousand pounds, you shall receive two thousand pounds within"
"ten days after signing the treaty, and Baron Clyde will be my surety."""
"""Two thousand pounds?"" mused Lilly. ""That is rather a small sum in so"
"great a transaction."""
"""I doubt not the purchase may be made without the help of the stars if"
"you feel that two thousand pounds is too small a sum to be considered,"""
returned the Abbé.
"""No, no,"" said Lilly. ""I understand that you wish me to set a figure and"
"work out the solution of this affair, and if I learn from the stars that"
it is to King Charles's interest to accept your offer of one hundred
"thousand pounds for the city of Dunkirk, I am to receive--"""
"""If King Charles accepts!"" interrupted the Abbé."
"""Ah, I see! Yes, yes, of course,"" returned Lilly. ""I shall go to work"
immediately and set my figure. Of course I do not know what I shall
"learn, but I shall be glad to learn from the stars that which will enable"
me to advise the king according to your wishes. Two thousand pounds are
"two thousand pounds, and the word of a king is but a breath."""
Dex Harlow was a six-foot Senior Lieutenant who had been on many an
out-of-the-way exploratory trip. Like Brand he was just under thirty
and perpetually thirsting for the bizarre in life. He was a walking
document of planetary activity. He was still baked a brick red from a
"trip to Mercury a year before: he had a scar on his forehead, the"
result of jumping forty feet one day on the moon when he'd meant to
jump only twenty; he was minus a finger which had been irreparably
frost-bitten on Mars; and he had a crumpled nose that was the outcome
of a brush with a ten-foot bandit on Venus who'd tried to kill him for
"his explosive gun and supply of glass, dyite-containing cartridges."
"He clutched Brand's fingers in a bone-mangling grip, and threw his hat"
into a far corner.
"""You're a fine friend!"" he growled cheerfully. ""Here I'm having a"
"first rate time for myself, swimming and planing along the Riviera,"
with two more weeks leave ahead of me--and I get a call from the Old
"Man to report to you. What excuse have you for your crime?"""
"""A junket to Jupiter,"" said Brand. ""Would you call that a good"
"excuse?"""
"""Jupiter!"" exclaimed Dex. ""Wouldn't you know it? Of course you'd have"
to pick a spot four hundred million miles away from all that grand
"swimming I was having!"""
"""Would you like to go back on leave, and have me choose someone else?"""
inquired Brand solemnly.
"""Well, no,"" said Dex hastily. ""Now that I'm here, I suppose I might as"
"well go through with it."""
in certain curiosities. She had seen that morning what had escaped the
Canon’s notice--the stranger’s grasp on Yvonne’s arm and the insolent
"admiration on his face. This fact, coupled with Yvonne’s agitation, had"
"put her upon the track of scandal. The result was, that at the concert"
"she made interesting discoveries, and, piecing things together in her"
"mind afterwards, bided her time to make use of them."
"It would be for the Canon’s sake, naturally. A woman of Mrs."
Winstanley’s stamp is always the most disinterested of God’s creatures.
She never performed an action of which her conscience did not approve.
But she was such a superior woman that her conscience trembled a little
"before her, like most of the other friends whom she patronised. She did"
not have to wait long. The Canon called upon her soon after his return
to invite herself and the Wilmingtons to dinner. It was his last
"evening at Ostend, and Yvonne was not feeling well enough to spend it,"
"as usual, at the Kursaal."
"“Yvonne is still poorly, Everard?” she asked, with her air of"
confidential responsibility.
"“A little. She has been gadding about somewhat too much lately, and it"
has knocked her up.”
“Has it not occurred to you that her encounter this morning may have had
something to do with it?”
"“Of course not,” replied the Canon, sharply. “It would be ridiculous.”"
"“I have reasons for not thinking so, Everard. The man was singing at the"
Kursaal this afternoon. Here is his name on the programme.” She
handed him the slip of paper. He read the name among the artistes. “M.
Bazouge.” He returned it to her.
recognized by those whom I did know ha my former life.  There is scarce
an antechamber in those fine houses where patrons dwell where I might
not meet the curious and impertinent regard of those who would know me
"again. That I will not brook.""  And now Grey’s eyes flashed, thinking of"
"Lord Sandford, and how he would chuckle to hear how low his rival had"
"fallen.  ""No; if I am to succeed at all, I must needs do so without a"
"patron. If I fail, there is one resource left.  Able-bodied paupers are"
"sent to the wars.  I can go thither and fight."""
Again a smile flickered over the Old Lion’s face; but the tapster was
"entering with the smoking viands, and the gleam in Grey’s eyes bespoke"
the wolf within him.
"""Set to, my friend, and make a good meal.  When we have cleared the"
"trenchers, you shall come with me to my lodging.  I would hear the end"
"of your tale; but that can wait till after supper."""
*CHAPTER XI.*
*THE LION’S DEN.*
"""Welcome to the Lion’s Den!"" spoke the man Wylde, as he threw open the"
"door of a room which he had unlocked, and kicking a smouldering log upon"
"the hearth, evoked a cheery blaze, by the aid of which he lighted a lamp"
"that swung over a table littered with books, papers, and quills."
"Grey stepped within the threshold, and looked about him with curious"
eyes.  The house they had entered a few minutes before was a tall and
unknown to her. She would go back to the old world and the old circle of
it. What would happen after that she was too listless to think. It was
"summed up in negations; and these again melted into one great want, the"
absence of the man to whom her imagination and her heart blindly and
obstinately clung.
"Lady Eynesford had left her newspaper, and Alicia found her hand upon"
"it. Taking it up, she read Medland's evidence at the inquest. A sudden"
revulsion of feeling seized her. Was this the man she was dreaming
"about, a man who calmly, coolly, as though caring nothing, told that"
story in the face of all the world? Was she never to get rid of the
spell he had cast on her before she knew what he really was? For a man
"like this she had sacrificed her self-respect, bandied insults with a"
"vulgar upstart, and brought on her head a reproach more fitting for an"
ill-mannered child. She threw the paper from her and rose to her feet.
She would think no more of him; he might be what he would; he was no fit
"subject for her thoughts, and he and the place where he lived and all"
"this wretched country deserved nothing better than to be forgotten,"
"resolutely, utterly, soon."
"""I am very sorry, Mary,"" she was saying, ten minutes later; ""I deserved"
"all you said. I don't know what foolishness possessed me. See, I have"
"written and apologised to Mr. Coxon."""
And Lady Eynesford kissed her and thanked heaven that they would soon
have done with Mr. Coxon and--all the rest.
CHAPTER XXVI.
official? But the very German nurses and doctors at the Red Cross
hospital had spoken of her having given free treatment in her Home
"to Germans who needed immediate operations, and for whom there was"
no room in the military hospitals--And for such a trivial offence as
_that_--and to kill her before there could be any appeal for
reconsideration or clemency. Oh _what_ a nation! She would tend
their sick and wounded no more.
She hurried on up the ascent of the Boulevard of the Botanic Garden
on her way to the Rue Royale. She burst into von Giesselin's office.
He was not there. A clerk looking at her rather closely said that
"the Herr Oberst was packing, was going away. Vivie scarcely took in"
"the meaning of his German phrases. She waited there, her eyes"
"ablaze, feeling she must tell her former friend and protector what"
she thought of his people before she renounced any further
relations with him.
"Presently he entered, his usually rather florid face pale with"
"intense sorrow or worry, his manner preoccupied. She burst out:"
"""_Have_ you seen the Red Placard they have just put up?"""
"""What about?"" he said wearily."
"""The assassination by your Government of Edith Cavell, a crime for"
"which England--yes, and America--will _never_ forgive you.... From"
"this moment I--"""
"""But have you not heard what has happened to _me_? I am _dismissed_"
"from my post as Secretary, I am ordered to rejoin my regiment in"
Lorraine--It is very sad about your Miss Cavell. I knew nothing of
it till this morning when I received my own dismissal--And _oh_ my
"dear Miss, I fear we shall never meet again."""
THE UNCLEAN THING.
"A few days later, Mr. Dick Derosne was walking in the Park at noon. He"
had been down to the Club and found no one there. Everybody except
"himself was at work: the politicians were scattered all over the colony,"
conducting their election campaign. Medland himself had gone to his
"constituency: his seat was very unsafe there, and he was determined to"
"keep it if he could, although, as a precaution, he was also a candidate"
"for the North-east ward of Kirton, where his success was beyond doubt."
"His friends and his foes had followed him out of town, and the few who"
were left were busy in the capital itself. Such men as these when at the
"Club would talk of nothing but the crisis, and, after he had heard all"
"there was to hear about the Benyon affair, the crisis began to bore"
"Dick. After all, it mattered very little to him; he would be out of it"
"all in a month, and the Medlands were not, when he came to think of it,"
"people of great importance. Why, the Grangers had never heard of them!"
"Decidedly, he had had enough and to spare of the Medlands."
"Nevertheless, he was to have a little more of them, for at this instant"
"he saw Daisy Medland approaching him. Escape was impossible, and Dick"
had the grace to shrink from appearing to avoid her.
"""The deuce!"" he thought, ""this is awkward. I hope she won't--"" He raised"
his hat with elaborate politeness.
Daisy stopped and greeted him with much effusion and without any
embarrassment. Dick thought that odd.
"""I was afraid,"" she said, ""we were not going to see you again before you"
"disappeared finally with the Governor."""
"misery, the Girl's face turned pale."
"""What do you mean?"" she asked."
"Johnson coloured, hesitated, and finally with a swift glance at the"
"clock, he briefly explained:"
"""I mean it's hard to go and leave you here. The clock reminded me that"
long before this I should have been on my way. I shouldn't have come up
"here at all. God bless you, dear,"" and here their eyes came together and"
"seemed unable to part,--""I love you as I never thought I could . . ."""
But at Johnson's queer look she hastened to inquire:
"""But it ain't for long you're goin'?"""
For long! Then she had not understood that he meant to go for all time.
How tell her the truth? While he pondered over the situation there came
"to him with great suddenness the thought that, perhaps, after all, Life"
never intended that she should be given to him only to be taken away
almost as suddenly; and seized with a desire to hold on to her at any
"cost, he sprang forward as if to take her in his arms, but before he"
"reached her, he stopped short."
"""Such happiness is not for me,"" he muttered under his breath; and then"
"aloud he added: ""No, no, I've got to go now while I have the courage, I"
"mean."" He broke off as suddenly as he had begun, and taking her face in"
his hands he kissed her good-bye.
"Now, accustomed as was the Girl to the strange comings and goings of the"
"men at the camp, it did not occur to her to question him further when he"
"told her that he should have been away before now. Moreover, she trusted"
This teacher had once taught at an institution in one of the towns on
"the Volga, but in consequence of some story was dismissed.  After this"
"he was a clerk in a tannery, but again had to leave.  Then he became a"
"librarian in some private library, subsequently following other"
"professions.  Finally, after passing examinations in law he became a"
"lawyer, but drink reduced him to the Captain's dosshouse.  He was tall,"
"round-shouldered, with a long sharp nose and bald head.  In his bony"
"and yellow face, on which grew a wedge-shaped beard, shone large,"
"restless eyes, deeply sunk in their sockets, and the corners of his"
"mouth drooped sadly down.  He earned his bread, or rather his drink, by"
reporting for the local papers.  He sometimes earned as much as fifteen
roubles.  These he gave to the Captain and said:
"""It is enough.  I am going back into the bosom of culture. Another"
"week's hard work and I shall dress respectably, and then Addio, mio"
"caro!"""
"""Very exemplary!  As I heartily sympathise with your decision, Philip,"
"I shall not give you another glass all this week,"" the Captain warned"
him sternly.
"""I shall be thankful! .... You will not give me one drop?"""
The Captain heard in his voice a beseeching note to which he turned a
deaf ear.
"""Even though you roar, I shall not give it you!"""
"""As you like, then,"" sighed the teacher, and went away to continue his"
"reporting.  But after a day or two he would return tired and thirsty,"
and would look at the Captain with a beseeching glance out of the
"corners of his eyes, hoping that his friend's heart would soften."
Louis XIV because of a too great friendliness for one of the king's
"sweethearts, and was living in exile in London till Louis should forgive"
his interference. The French king really liked De Grammont and trusted
"him when his Majesty's lady-loves were not concerned, so the count had"
"been sent to England in honorable exile, and was employed in certain"
cases as a spy and in others as a means of secret communication between
the French king and persons connected with the court of Charles II.
"When De Grammont saw me, he came forward, holding out both hands in his"
"effusive French manner, apparently overjoyed at finding a long-lost"
brother.
"""Come with me, my dear baron,"" he cried, bending so close to me that I"
"feared he was going to kiss me. ""Come with me! You are the very man of"
"all the world I want, I need, I must have!"""
"""You have me, my dear count,"" said I, ""but I cannot go with you. I am"
"engaged elsewhere."""
"""No, no, let me whisper!"" He brought his lips close to my ear and"
"continued almost inaudibly: ""You may please me. You may help a friend."
"You may oblige--a king."""
"The last, of course, was the _ne plus ultra_ of inducement according to"
"the count's way of thinking, and he supposed the mere suggestion would"
"vanquish me. Still I pleaded my engagement. He insisted, however,"
repeating in my ear:--
"""Oblige a king! A real king! Not a flimsy fool of bourgeois, who makes of"
"himself the laughing-stock of his people, but a real king. I cannot name"
"him now, but you must know."""
CHAPTER VI
RETRIBUTION
Beneath the dark cornices of a thicket of wind-stunted pines stood a
"small company of men, looking out into the hastening night. The"
"half-light of evening lay over the scene, rolling wood and valley into"
"a misty mass, while the horizon stood curbed by a belt of heavy"
"thunder-clouds. In the western vault, a vast rent in the wall of gray"
shot out a blaze of translucent gold that slanted like a spear shaft
to a sullen sea.
The walls of Astura shone white and ghostly athwart the plains.
Sea-gulls came screaming to the cliffs. Presently out of the blue
"bosom of an unearthly twilight a vague wind arose. Gusts came,"
"clamored, and died into nothingness. The world seemed to shudder. A"
red sword flashed sudden out of the skies and smote the hills. Thunder
"followed, growling over the world. The lurid crater of Vesuvius poured"
"gold upon the sea, whose hoarse underchant mingled with the fitful"
wind.
A storm came creeping black out of the west. The sea grew dark. The
forests began to weave the twilight into their columned halls. A
sudden gust came clamoring through the woods. The myriad boughs tossed
"and jerked against the sky, while a mysterious gloom of trees rolled"
back against the oncoming night.
"The men upon the hill strained their eyes towards the sea, where the"
There was nothing more to be done till day-break. They had played their
"last card, and now they must wait to see what cards were out against"
"them, and who should win the final trick at the hour of sunrise."
"Rollo fell asleep again. And so soundly this time, that he only woke to"
consciousness when a soldier in a white _boina_ pulled roughly at his
"elbow, and ordered him to get up."
"All about the granary the Carlists were stamping feet, pulling on boots,"
and flapping arms.
"""It's a cold morning to be shot in,"" said the man, with rough"
"kindliness; ""but I will get you some hot chocolate in a moment. That"
"will warm your blood for you, and in any case you will have a quick"
passage. I will pick you a firing party of the best shots in the three

Then he smiled a little grimly. His sufferings from indigestion produced

of your naval mysteries. Few questions were asked; you admitted me as

"shop at Southampton, joined a trade union, attended Socialist"
"meetings--I, a member of one of the oldest families in Trieste. Though"
"a Catholic, I bent my knee in the English Church, and this was not"
"difficult, for I had always attended service in the chapel at"
"Blundell's. To you, my friend, I can say this, for you are of some"
strange sect which consigns to the lowest Hell both Catholics and
"""No, thanks. I'm going to do something lots more exciting than sitting"

"them, her head high."
"Sidney had a moment's longing to run after her and coax her to come,"
"but Pola's light giggle checked her. ""Isn't she a riot? I'd have _died_"
"if she'd come with us!"""
"""Oh, Pola--she'll hear you!"" pleaded Sidney."
She hated herself because she did not tell Pola at once how bravely
"Mart shouldered her responsibilities, about gran'ma, who looked to Mart"
for everything. Instead she simply walked along with Pola and let Pola
"giggle. Pola, sensing Sidney's feelings, slipped her arm through hers"
and gave it an affectionate little squeeze.
"""You're such a funny child,"" she said softly. ""You'd be nice to"
"anything. I can't, of course, for I go around to so many places and"
"mother's warned me often about strangers. Anyway, it's lots nicer for"
"just us two to be together, isn't it?"""
But in spite of Pola's soft flattery and countless lumps of sugar the
"tea tasted bitter to Sidney and the Green Lantern, with its futurist"
"awnings, its bizarre hangings and cushions, had no allure. The thought"
came suddenly to Sidney that it had been a whole week since she had
even seen Mart; in that time she had scarcely exchanged more than a
half dozen words with Lavender.
To the tune of Pola's ceaseless chatter Sidney's thoughts kept darting
back to that uncomfortable fact. Pola always talked of things she had
"done at home, abroad, at school, of her boy friends whom she called"
"""men."" She liked to hint of countless ""affairs"" which simply must not"
"""Splendid!"" cry the people, approving the orator's deduction, and Tyapa"
"bellows all the time, scratching his breast.  He always bellows like"
"this as he drinks his first glass of vodki, when he has a drunken"
headache.  The Captain beams with joy.  They next read the
"correspondence.  This is, for the Captain, ""an abundance of drinks,"" as"
he himself calls it.  He always notices how the merchants make this
"life abominable, and how cleverly they spoil everything.  His speeches"
thunder at and annihilate merchants. His audience listens to him with
"the greatest pleasure, because he swears atrociously.  ""If I wrote for"
"the papers,"" he shouts, ""I would show up the merchant in his true"
"colours ...  I would show that he is a beast, playing for a time the"
"role of a man. I understand him!  He is a rough boor, does not know the"
"meaning of the words 'good taste,' has no notion of patriotism, and his"
"knowledge is not worth five kopecks."""
"Abyedok, knowing the Captain's weak point, and fond of making other"
"people angry, cunningly adds:"
"""Yes, since the nobility began to make acquaintance with hunger, men"
"have disappeared from the world ..."""
"""You are right, you son of a spider and a toad.  Yes, from the time"
"that the noblemen fell, there have been no men.  There are only"
"merchants, and I hate them."""
"""That is easy to understand, brother, because you, too, have been"
"brought down by them ..."""
"""I?  I was ruined by love of life ...  Fool that I was, I loved life,"
"but the merchant spoils it, and I cannot bear it, simply for this"
"reason, and not because I am a nobleman. But if you want to know the"

The Captain shrugged and spread his arms wide.

"The fiddler, doubting but hypnotized, handed him the fiddle; his dark"
face changed when he saw this stranger fling it up to his shoulder and
the ways of his fingers with bow and strings.  Fiorsen had begun to walk
"up the street, his eyes searching for the flower-boxes.  He saw them,"
"stopped, and began playing ""Che faro?""  He played it wonderfully on that"
"poor fiddle; and the fiddler, who had followed at his elbow, stood"
"watching him, uneasy, envious, but a little entranced.  Sapristi!  This"
"tall, pale monsieur with the strange face and the eyes that looked drunk"
"and the hollow chest, played like an angel!  Ah, but it was not so easy"
as all that to make money in the streets of this sacred town!  You might
play like forty angels and not a copper!  He had begun another tune--like
"little pluckings at your heart--tres joli--tout a fait ecoeurant! Ah,"
"there it was--a monsieur as usual closing the window, drawing the"
curtains!  Always same thing!  The violin and the bow were thrust back
into his hands; and the tall strange monsieur was off as if devils were
"after him--not badly drunk, that one!  And not a sou thrown down!  With"
an uneasy feeling that he had been involved in something that he did not
"understand, the lame, dark fiddler limped his way round the nearest"
"corner, and for two streets at least did not stop.  Then, counting the"
"silver Fiorsen had put into his hand and carefully examining his fiddle,"
"he used the word, ""Bigre!"" and started for home."

There was little to be discerned clearly when he emerged into the cool
"damp darkness, only a dim heap of writhing bodies as in some combat of"
hounds or of the denizens of the midnight forest. But Rollo once and
again saw a flash of steel and a hand uplifted to strike. Without
waiting to think he gripped that which was topmost and therefore nearest
"to him, and finding it unexpectedly light, he swung the thing clear by"
the garment he had clutched. As he did so he felt a pain in his right
"shoulder, which at the time appeared no more than the bite of a squirrel"
"or the sting of a bee. With one heave he threw the object, human or not"
"he could not for the moment determine, behind him into the blackness of"
the hall.
"""Take hold there, somebody!"" he cried, for by this time he could hear"
the clattering of the feet of his followers on the stairs and flagged
"where to find Vance and the woman. Now."""
"""Were they responsible?"""
"""With deepest apologies, that need not trouble you."" He stood ramrod"
straight.
"""With deepest apologies, Sato-sama, it troubles me very much."" Nogami"
"examined his cigar. ""This entire affair is very troublesome. In times"
past I remember a certain prejudice in favor of civility on the part of
"Tokyo. Have things really changed that much?"""
"""The moment for soft words is past. Tonight ended that."""
"Nogami drew on his cigar. ""Assuming you locate Vance, what action do"
"you propose taking?"""
Even Aileen had not been shot at with a pistol. And then Tildy rather
"hoped that he would not shoot at her, for she was always loyal to"
Aileen; and she did not want to overshadow her friend.
At 4 o’clock on the afternoon of the third day Mr. Seeders came in.
There were no customers at the tables. At the back end of the
restaurant Tildy was refilling the mustard pots and Aileen was
quartering pies. Mr. Seeders walked back to where they stood.
"Tildy looked up and saw him, gasped, and pressed the mustard spoon"
against her heart. A red hair-bow was in her hair; she wore Venus’s
"Eighth Avenue badge, the blue bead necklace with the swinging silver"
symbolic heart.
Mr. Seeders was flushed and embarrassed. He plunged one hand into his
hip pocket and the other into a fresh pumpkin pie.
"“Miss Tildy,” said he, “I want to apologise for what I done the other"
"evenin’. Tell you the truth, I was pretty well tanked up or I wouldn’t"
of done it. I wouldn’t do no lady that a-way when I was sober. So I
"hope, Miss Tildy, you’ll accept my ’pology, and believe that I wouldn’t"
of done it if I’d known what I was doin’ and hadn’t of been drunk.”
"With this handsome plea Mr. Seeders backed away, and departed, feeling"
that reparation had been made.
But behind the convenient screen Tildy had thrown herself flat upon a
"table among the butter chips and the coffee cups, and was sobbing her"
heart out—out and back again to the grey plain wherein travel they with
blunt noses and hay-coloured hair. From her knot she had torn the red
hair-bow and cast it upon the floor. Seeders she despised utterly; she
had but taken his kiss as that of a pioneer and prophetic prince who
The repulsive creature outside made an authoritative gesture. He
"seemed to be beckoning to them, his huge dull eyes glaring"
threateningly at the same moment.
"""Our beanpole friend is suggesting that we get out of the shell and"
"stay awhile,"" said Dex with grim humor. ""They seem anxious to"
"entertain us--_ouch!_"""
"As the two men made no move to obey the beckoning gesture, the"
"creature had raised the tube again; and again the sharp, unpleasant"
shock shot through them.
"""What the devil are we going to do?"" exclaimed Brand. ""If we go out in"
that mob of nightmare things--it's going to be messy. As long as we
"stay in the shell we have some measure of protection."""
"""Not much protection when they can sting us through metal and glass at"
"will,"" growled Dex. ""Do you suppose they can turn the juice on harder?"
"Or is that bee-sting their best effort?"""
"As though in direct answer to his words, the blob-like face of the"
being who seemed in authority convulsed with anger and he raised the
tube again. This time the shock that came from it was sufficient to
throw the two men to the floor.
"""Well, we can't stay in the ship, that's certain,"" said Brand. ""I"
"guess there's only one thing to do."""
"Dex nodded. ""Climb out of here and take as many of these skinny"
"horrors with us into hell as we can,"" he agreed."
"Once more the shock stung them, as a reminder not to keep their"
"The door opened suddenly, the draught blowing down a fan and a"
"photograph-frame, and Miss Lindon entered."
"“My dear John, how good of you to come and see me!”"
"She was a fat, dumpy woman of fifty, lymphatic and, at first sight,"
"characterless. She lacked colour. Her eyes were light, but neither blue"
nor green nor hazel; her straight hair was of the nondescript hue of
"light-brown hair turning gray. Her face was fleshy and sallow, marked by"
"singularly few lines. She had lived a contented life, unscarred by care"
and unruffled by desire. Her dreams of the possibilities of existence
did not pierce beyond the gimcrackeries of Tregarthion Villas. As
"for the doings of the great world,--wars, politics, art, social"
"upheavals,--she bestowed on them, when they were obtruded on her notice,"
the same polite and unintelligent interest as she had bestowed on her
nephew's athletic feats in the days gone by.
"However, she smiled very amiably at John, and reached up to kiss him"
"on both cheeks, her flabby, white hands lightly resting on each"
"coat-sleeve. Having done this, she caught up the barking dog, who"
continued to growl from the soft shelter of arm and bosom with the
vindictiveness of pampered old age.
"“Naughty Dandy! I hope you were n't frightened at him, John. He never"
really does bite.”
“What does he do then? Sting?” John asked with gruff sarcasm.
"“Oh, no,” said Miss Lindon, round-eyed; “he 's quite harmless, I assure"
you. Don't you remember Dandy? But it's a long time since you 've been
"to see me, John. It must be three or four years. What have you been"
doing all this time?”
“Will it make you happy to promise?”
“Yes.”
"“Then I promise,” said Joyce, humouring him. “Now I’m not going to talk"
to you any more.”
"A few minutes later, his breathing told Joyce that he slept. The"
"newspapers fell from Joyce’s hand, and he put his elbows on his knees"
and crouched over the smouldering logs. Noakes spoke truly. There was
little chance of recovery. He would be left alone again soon. It would
be very comfortless. The poor wreck who was dragging out his last days
upon that wretched bed had been an unspeakable solace to him. Without
his womanlike devotion he would have died of fever six months back on
"the Arato goldfield. Without the influence of his calm fatalism, he"
would have given up heart long ago. Without his steadfast purity of
"soul, he would have gone recklessly to the devil. The thought of losing"
him was a great pang.
"He himself, too, was far from strong. The climate, the hard manual"
labour for which he was physically unfit were telling upon him heavily.
"He yearned for home, for civilised life, for the lost heritage of"
"honour. Yvonne’s letter, telling of the little commonplaces of the lost"
"sweet life of decent living, had revived the ever dormant longing. He"
"began to dream of her, of that last day he had seen her, of her voice"
singing Gounod’s serenade.
"It was difficult to picture her as married to his cousin Everard, whom,"
"in the days of his vanity, he had despised as a prig and now dreaded as"
a scornful benefactor. It was a strange mating. And yet she seemed happy
and unchanged.
"come to her mother's attention, assuring Sidney that she was absolutely"
the only one to whom she confided these deep intrigues. She had worn
Guy Townsend's fraternity pin the whole winter before and not a soul
had known whose pin it was for Guy was tabooed by mothers in general
and Mrs. Allan in particular. Now Pola was simply crazy over a Jack
"Sicard who was playing the lead in ""Hearts Aquiver."" But not even"
"Jack's manly beauty, as described by Pola, failed to draw from Sidney"
"more than a mild: ""He must be cute."" Pola gave way to vexation."
"""You're scarcely listening to me, Sidney Romley, when I'm telling you"
things I haven't told a _soul_! I believe you're still thinking of that
"ridiculous girl we met."""
"""She isn't ridiculous!"" Sidney was prompt enough now in Mart's defense."
"""She looks funny, but you see I've gotten well acquainted with her and"
"she's awfully nice."""
"""Oh, _nice_, of course! But _anyone_ can be nice! You know perfectly"
"well, Sidney, that there's as much class in this country as there is in"
"Europe and being _nice_ does not break down social barriers."""
Sidney had no answer ready for this. Curiously into her mind flashed
what Mr. Dugald had said about the solid aristocracy. But somehow she
knew Pola would not understand this. Pola went on:
"""I'm a dreadful little snob, anyway. But I suppose that is the result"
of my education. It would be funny to go to the most expensive schools
"and have all the culture that Europe can offer and _not_ be a snob."""
"Still Sidney stared into her teacup. She thought Pola was all wrong,"
but she did not know how to say it. Pola herself had told her that she
had gone to Grace Hall because it had no examinations and graduated a
"""Why are they sending you away?"" asked Vivie drily, compelled to"
interest herself in his affairs since they so closely affected her
own and her mother's.
"""Because of this,"" said von Giesselin, nearly in tears, pulling from"
"a small portfolio a press cutting. ""Do you remember a fortnight ago"
"I told you some one, some Belgian had written a beautiful poem and"
sent it to me for one of our newspapers? I showed it to you at the
"time and you said--you said 'it was well enough, but it did not seem"
"to have much point.'"" Vivie did remember having glanced very"
perfunctorily at some effusion in typewriting which had seemed
unobjectionable piffle. She hadn't cared two straws whether he
"accepted it or not, only did not want to be too markedly"
indifferent. Now she took it up and still read it through
"uncomprehendingly, her thoughts absent with the fate of Miss Cavell."
"""Well! what is all the fuss about? I still see nothing in it. It is"
just simply the ordinary sentimental flip-flap that a French
"versifier can turn out by the yard."""
"""It is _far_ worse than that! It is a horrible--what the French"
"call 'acrostiche,' a deadly insult to our people. And I never saw"
"it, the Editor never saw it, and you, even, never guessed its real"
"meaning![1] The original, as you say, was in typewriting, and at the"
bottom was the name and address of a very well-known homme de
lettres: and the words: 'Offert à la rédaction de l'Ami de L'Ordre.'
"He say now, _never never_ did he send it. It was a forgery. When we"
came to understand what it meant all the blame fall on me. I am sent
"back to the Army--I shall be killed before Verdun, so good-bye dear"
Miss--We have been good friends. Oh this War: this d-r-r-eadful
War--It has spoilt everything. Now we can never be friends with
"England again."""
"delighted to meet such redoubtable warriors, and hoped that now they"
"would come with me and help me, as my business was to fight Germans,"
"airships and all. This was strictly true, for, but for German"
"influence, there would have been no need to wage war on the Raiders"
who had only been induced to become our enemies by lying German
propaganda.
Idu said they would be only too glad to go with the Sahib and to help
him fight the enemies of the British Raj. He also told me that he had
already saved my life once that evening.
"""How was that?"" I asked, my spirits rising as I gazed through the"
darkness at my first three recruits.
"""Well, Sahib,"" returned Idu, ""when the airship, which you say is"
"no airship, stopped, in a little while we saw the figure of a man,"
"carrying a lantern moving towards us, and Halil here,"" laying his"
"hand on the shoulder of one of his pals, ""lifted his rifle and was"
"about to shoot. But I said, 'Nay. See, it is but one man. Let us wait"
and see who he is.' And then the lantern went out and there was no
"longer a target."""
"""You did well, Idu,"" I said solemnly. ""You have most certainly saved"
"my life, and as you seem to be as intelligent as you are brave, I"
shall appoint you to my personal staff. I am the officer who has
"been sent out to take command of the forces along the Sarhad, and in"
Seistan. But at the present moment my chief concern is to find the
"right road to Saindak. Can you show it to me?"""
"Idu laughed. ""I could lead you there blindfold, Sahib."""
"I felt the difficulties of the road were now over, and, piloted by"
"when supper was over, and she would not break faith with him even if it"
"were at the peril of her life. The next moment she went out, as did the"
red light in the Girl's lantern hanging on a peg of the outer door.
"""Oh, please, please,"" said the Girl, half-protestingly, half-willingly."
But the man was no longer to be denied; he kept on urging:
"""One kiss, only one."""
"Here was an appeal which could no longer be resisted, and though"
"half-frightened by the tone of his voice and the look in his eye, the"
Girl let herself be taken into his arms as she murmured:
"""'Tain't no use, I lay down my hands to you."""
"And so it was that, unconscious of the great havoc that was being"
"wrought by the storm, unconscious of the danger that momentarily"
"threatened their lives, they remained locked in each other's arms. The"
Girl made no attempt to silence him now or withdraw her hands from his.
Why should she? Had he not come to Cloudy Mountain to woo her? Was she
not awaiting his coming? To her it seemed but natural that the
"conventions should be as nothing in the face of love. His voice, low and"
"musical, charged with passion, thrilled through her."
"""I love you,"" said the man, with a note of possession that frightened"
"her while it filled her with strange, sweet joy. For months she had"
dreamed of him and loved him; no wonder that she looked upon him as her
hero and yielded herself entirely to her fate.
She lifted her eyes and he saw the love in them. She freed her hands
"from his grasp, and then gave them back to him in a little gesture of"
that mattered.
"""I can not,"" she said."
"""Beatrice, do not deceive yourself. Though my life is nothing to"
me--though I would give it a dozen times to save you--I can not do
"otherwise than go on. I may be weak, but I shall be stronger than my"
"weakness. My word is given!"""
He spoke with the tempestuous energy of despair. The minutes were
"passing with terrible swiftness, and any moment the sea behind him"
might burst its dam and sweep her and him to destruction. Already in
the distance he heard the dull clamour of voices raised in angry
remonstrance at the delay. Only those immediately about him were held
in awed silence by the power of his personality. Again Beatrice shook
her head. She stood in the doorway which opened out into the garden
where the besieged had taken refuge. There was no other way. He
advanced toward her. Instantly she raised her revolver and pointed it
at the first man behind him.
"""If I fire,"" she said, ""not even you will be able to hold them back."""
It seemed to her that she stood like a frail wall between two
"overwhelming forces--on the one side, Nehal with his thousands; on the"
"other, Nicholson--alone, truly, but armed with a set and pitiless"
"resolve. A single sentence, which had fallen upon her ears months"
"before, rose now out of an ocean of half-forgotten memories:"
"""Nicholson is the best shot in India,"" some one had said: ""he never"
"misses."" And still Nehal advanced. His jaws were locked, his eyes had"
a red fire in them. She knew then that the hour of hesitation was
"over, and that in that desperate struggle she had indeed lost."
Uncontrollable words of warning rushed to her lips.
"this, and all will be well.'"
"So the woman went forth with a light heart. It was so simple, only a"
"pinch of mustard-seed, and mustard grew in every garden. She would get"
"the seed and be back very quickly, and then the Lord Buddha would give"
her back those she loved who had died. She clothed herself again and
"tied up her hair, and went cheerfully and asked at the first house,"
"'Give me a pinch of mustard-seed,' and it was given readily. So with her"
treasure in her hand she was going forth back to the Buddha full of
"delight, when she remembered."
"'Has ever anyone died in your household?' she asked, looking round"
wistfully.
"The man answered 'Yes,' that death had been with them but recently. Who"
"could this woman be, he thought, to ask such a question? And the woman"
"went forth, the seed dropping from her careless fingers, for it was of"
"no value. So she would try again and again, but it was always the same."
"Death had taken his tribute from all. Father or mother, son or brother,"
"daughter or wife, there was always a gap somewhere, a vacant place"
"beside the meal. From house to house throughout the city she went, till"
"at last the new hope faded away, and she learned from the world, what"
"she had not believed from the Buddha, that death and life are one."
"So she returned, and she became a nun, poor soul! taking on her the two"
"hundred and twenty-seven vows, which are so hard to keep that nowadays"
nuns keep but five of them.[1]
"This is the teaching of the Buddha, that death is inevitable; this is"
"the consolation he offers, that all men must know death; no one can"
escape death; no one can escape the sorrow of the death of those whom he
"""We can do nothing but await the critical moment,"" said the Captain,"
"walking about among them.  ""When they turn us out we shall seek a new"
"place for ourselves, but at present there is no use spoiling our life"
by thinking of it ...  In times of crisis one becomes energetic ... and
if life were fuller of them and every moment of it so arranged that we
were compelled to tremble for our lives all the time ...  By God! life
"would be livelier and even fuller of interest and energy than it is!"""
"""That means that people would all go about cutting one another's"
"throats,"" explained Abyedok, smilingly."
"""Well, what about it?"" asked the Captain, angrily.  He did not like to"
hear his thoughts illustrated.
"""Oh!  Nothing!  When a person wants to get anywhere quickly he whips up"
"the horses, but of course it needs fire to make engines go ..."""
"""Well, let everything go to the Devil as quickly as possible. I'm sure"
I should be pleased if the earth suddenly opened up or was burned or
destroyed somehow .. only I were left to the last in order to see the
"others consumed ..."""
"""Ferocious creature!"" smiled Abyedok."
"""Well, what of that?  I ... I was once a man .. now I am an outcast ..."
that means I have no obligations. It means that I am free to spit on
everyone.  The nature of my present life means the rejection of my past

"dressed, and who look upon me with contempt because I am inferior to"
them in the matter of feeding or dressing. I must develop something new

"from the side she had just left; and, looking round, she saw with terror"
"a great eagle sweep down upon the baby, and carry it off in its claws."
"She turned round and waved her arms and cried out to the eagle, 'He!"
he!' hoping it would be frightened and drop the baby. But it cared
"nothing for her cries or threats, and swept on with long curves over the"
"forest trees, away out of sight."
"Then the mother turned to gain the bank once more, and suddenly she"
missed her son who had been waiting for her. He had seen his mother wave
"her arms; he had heard her shout, and he thought she was calling him to"
"come to her. So the brave little man walked down into the water, and the"
"black current carried him off his feet at once. He was gone, drowned in"
"the deep water below the ford, tossing on the waves towards the sea."
No one can write of the despair of the girl when she threw herself under
a tree in the forest. The song says it was very terrible.
"At last she said to herself, 'I will get up now and return to my father"
in Thawatti; he is all I have left. Though I have forsaken him all these
"years, yet now that my husband and his children are dead, my father will"
"take me back again. Surely he will have pity on me, for I am much to be"
pitied.'
"So she went on, and at length, after many days, she came to the gates of"
the great city where her father lived.
"At the entering of the gates she met a large company of people,"
"mourners, returning from a funeral, and she spoke to them and asked"
them:
'Who is it that you have been burying to-day so grandly with so many
mourners?'
discovered in him by the patient searcher. She insisted upon sitting
next to him and in holding his hand when it was not employed in
conveying food to his mouth. She was startled at first by the
"discussion upon the prisons most suitable for me, but quickly became"
reconciled to the idea of a temporary separation.
"""Colonel Dawson,"" she asked. ""When daddy is in prison, may I come and"
"see him sometimes. Mother and me?"" Dawson gripped his hair--we were"
"the maddest crew!--and replied. ""Of course you shall, Miss Jane, as"
"often as you like."""
"""Thank you, Colonel Dawson; you are a nice man. I love you. Now show"
"me the handcuffs in your pocket."""
For the second time that day poor Dawson blushed. He must have
regretted many times that he had mentioned to me those unfortunate
darbies. Now amid much laughter he was compelled to draw forth a
pretty shining pair of steel wristlets and permit Jane to put them on.
They were much too large for her; she could slip them on and off
"without unlocking; but as toys they were a delight. ""I shouldn't mind"
"being a prisoner,"" she declared, ""if dear Colonel Dawson took me up."""
"We were sitting upon the fire-guard after luncheon, dallying over our"
"coffee, when Jane demanded to be shown a real arrest. ""Show me how you"
"take up a great big man like Daddy."""
"Then came a surprise, which for a moment had so much in it of bitter"
realism that it drove the blood from my wife's cheeks. I could not
follow Dawson's movements; his hands flickered like those of a
"conjurer, there came a sharp click, and the handcuffs were upon my"
"wrists! I stared at them speechless, wondering how they got there,"
"and, looking up, met the coldly triumphant eyes of the detective. I"
"already hear the clattering of the horses of the general's cavalcade,"
"and he knew that if upon his arrival he had not carried out his orders,"
he might expect a severe reprimand.
But it was not the general's suite that rode so furiously. The sound
"came from a contrary direction. Two horses were being ridden at speed,"
and at sight of the four men set in order against the wall the foremost
rider sank both spurs into her white mare and dashed forward with a wild
cry.
"The officer already had his sword raised in the air, the falling of"
which was to be the signal for the volley of death. But it did not fall.
Something in the aspect of the girl-rider as she swept up parallel with
"the low garden wall, her hair floating disordered about her"
shoulders--her eyes black and shining like stars--the sheaf of papers
"she waved in her hand, all compelled the Carlist to suspend that last"
irrevocable order.
"It was Concha Cabezos who arrived when the eleventh hour was long past,"
and leaped from her reeking horse opposite the place of execution. With
"her, wild-haired as a Mænad, rode La Giralda, cross-saddled like a man."
"""General Cabrera! Where is General Cabrera?"" cried Concha. ""I must see"
"him instantly. These are no traitors. They are true men, and in the"
"service of Don Carlos. Here are their papers!"""
"""Where is Ramon Cabrera? Tell me quickly!"" cried La Giralda. ""I have"
news for him. I was with his mother when she died. They whipped me at
the cross of Tortosa to tell what I knew--stripping me to the waist they
"whipped me, being old and the mother of many. Cabrera will avenge me."
"Let me but see Ramon Cabrera whom of old I suckled at my breasts!"""
realised then exactly how the professional manhunter glares at the
"prey into whom, after many days, he has set his claws. My wife gasped"
"and clutched at my elbow, little Jane screamed, and for a few seconds"
even I thought that the game had been played and that serious business
"was about to begin. Dawson gave us a few seconds of apprehension, and"
"then laughed grimly. From his waistcoat pocket he drew a key, and the"
fetters were removed almost as quickly as they had been clapped on.
"""Tit for tat,"" said he. ""You have had your fun with me. Fair play is a"
"jewel."""
"Little Jane was the first to recover speech. ""I knew that dear Colonel"
"Dawson was only playing,"" she cried. ""He only did it to please me."
"Thank you, Colonel, though you did frighten me just a weeny bit at"
"first."" And pulling him down towards her she kissed him heartily upon"
his prickly cheek. It was a queer scene.
"The door bell rang loudly, and we were informed that a policeman stood"
"without who was inquiring for Chief Inspector Dawson. ""Show him in"
"here,"" said I. The constable entered, and his manner of addressing my"
guest--that of a raw second lieutenant towards a general of
division--shed a new light upon Dawson's pre-eminence in his Service.
"""A telegram for you, sir."" Dawson seized it, was about to tear it"
"open, remembered suddenly his hostess, and bowed towards her. ""Have I"
"your permission, madam?"" he asked. She smiled and nodded; I turned"
"away to conceal a laugh. ""Good,"" cried Dawson, poring over the"
"message. ""I think, Mr. Copplestone, that you had better telephone to"
"your office and say that you are unavoidably detained."""
"""What--what is it?"" cried my wife, who had again become white with"
sudden fear.
"""Something which will occupy the attention of your husband and myself"
"""Tiger-Lily"" was not altogether gone. She looked back, her face"
wrinkling into one of those strangely unbecoming expressions of grim
playfulness.
"""I've half a mind to make an 'At Home' out of YOU!"" she said, nodding"
"at him energetically. ""Only you're not important enough!"""
Villiers burst out laughing. He was not proof against this touch of
"humor, and on a sudden good-natured impulse, sprang to the door and"
shook hands with her.
"""No, indeed, I am not!"" he said, with a charming smile--""Think of"
"it!--I haven't even invented a new biscuit! Come, let me see you into"
"the hall,--I'm really sorry if I've spoken roughly, but I assure you"
"Alwyn's not at all the sort of man you want for interviewing,--he's far"
too modest and noble-hearted. Believe me!--I'm not romancing a
"bit--I'm in earnest. There ARE some few fine, manly, gifted fellows"
"left in the world, who do their work for the love of the work alone,"
"and not for the sake of notoriety, and he is one of them. Now I'm not"
"certain, if you were quite candid with me, you'd admit that you"
yourself don't think much of the people who actually LIKE to be
"interviewed?"""
"His amiable glance, his kindly manner, took the gaunt female by"
"surprise, and threw her quite off her guard. She laughed,--a natural,"
unforced laugh in which there was not a trace of bitterness. He was
"really a delightful young man, she thought, in spite of his"
"old-fashioned, out-of-the-way notions!"
"""Well, perhaps I don't!"" she replied frankly--""But you see it is not my"
"business to think about them at all. I simply 'interview' them,--and I"
"generally find they are very willing, and often eager, to tell me all"
stalk-like legs of his attackers from under them. One of the things
"went down, to twist weakly in a laborious attempt to rise again. But"
"the other, by sheer force of height and reach, began to bear Dex down."
"Savagely he laced out with his fists, battering the pulpy face that"
"was pressing down close to his. The big eyes blinked shut, but the"
four hose-like arms did not relax their clasp. Dex's hands sought
"fiercely for the thing's throat. But it had no throat: the head, set"
"directly on the thin shoulders, defied all throttling attempts."
*       *       *       *       *
"Then, just as Dex was feeling that the end had come, he felt the"
"creature wrench from him, and saw it slide in a tangle of arms and"
"legs over the smooth metal pavement. He got shakily to his feet, to"
see Brand standing over him and flailing out with his fists at an ever
tightening circle of towering figures.
"""Thanks,"" panted Dex. And he began again, tripping the twelve-foot"
"things in order to get them down within reach, battering at the great"
"pulpy heads, fighting blindly in that expressed craving to take as"
many of the creatures into hell with him as he could manage. Beside
"him fought Brand, steadily, coolly, grim of jaw and unblinking of eye."
Already the struggle had gone on far longer than they had dreamed it
might. For some reason the grotesque creatures delayed killing them.
"That they could do so any time they pleased, was certain: if the"
monsters could reach them with their shock-tubes through the double
"insulated hull of the space ship, they could certainly kill them out"
in the open.
Yet they made no move to do so. The deadly tubes were not used. The
grounded with a coaxial sheath. But there was a clear section that led
"directly down to the CPU. That's where he'd place the blade, and hope"
it'd at least short- circuit the power feed even if it didn't sever the
wires completely.
"He tested the radio transmitter one last time, making sure it would"
"activate the blade, then reached down and clamped the mechanism onto"
"the wire, tightening it with thumb screws. When it was as secure as he"
"could make it, he stood back and examined his handiwork. If somebody"
"decided to remove the faceplate, they'd spot it in a second, but"
otherwise . . .
"Quickly, hands trembling from the cold, he fitted the cover back on the"
module and began replacing the screws with the tiny screwdriver. It
"wasn't magnetized, a deliberate choice, so the small screws kept"
"slipping between his bulky fingers, a problem made more acute by the"
numbing cold.
Three screws to go . . . then he heard the noise. Footsteps on the
aluminum catwalk in the pressure bay above. . . . _Shit_.
"He kept working as fast as he could, grimly holding the screws secure"
and fighting back the numbness and pain in his freezing fingers.
"Only one more. Above, he could hear the sounds of someone checking each"
"of the equipment bays, methodically opening and then resecuring them."
"First the starboard side bay was opened and closed, then the portside"
bay. Now he heard footsteps advancing down the metal stairs leading to
the computer bay. They were five seconds away from discovering him.
The last screw was in.
"fain hope that some day I may see him again."""
"""You had speech with him?  You saw his manner and his port?  Tell"
"me—show me—how did he carry himself?"""
"Grey rose to his feet, laughing.  He humoured the whim of the old actor."
"He was not lacking in the histrionic gift, and threw himself into his"
"part with good will.  He uttered quick commands, as though to his"
"officers; he threw out his arms, as though directing one man here,"
"another there.  He recalled numbers of words spoken by the General, and"
these he reproduced faithfully and with an excellent imitation of
"Marlborough’s polished, courteous, yet commanding air.  Then he let his"
"face soften, and addressed the old man as he himself had been addressed,"
"with words of thanks and with promises of friendship.  Finally, throwing"
"off the mask, he broke into a laugh, and was astonished at the eager"
change which had come upon the Old Lion.
"""Boy!"" he cried, with a new access of energy, ""I trow I see for both of"
"us a way to fame and fortune."""
Grey’s eyes lighted as he eagerly asked his meaning.
"""That is soon told.  Have you heard how, after the victory of Blenheim,"
none could be found to hymn the praises of the great General till the
"poet Addison was introduced to notice, and penned his immortal lines?"
"Now, since the victory of Ramillies, I have burned with desire to show"
the world by somewhat more than verse alone the power and genius of
"England’s mighty soldier.  See here!"""
"The old man rose and crossed to his table, where he fetched from a"
"drawer a scroll covered with writing, which he put in the hands of his"
"companion.  Grey saw that it was a dialogue cast in dramatic form, and"
"again, would explain nothing, and name no quarter from which help"
"might come. All the afternoon the camp lay grilling in the sunshine,"
and in the shuttered room in the middle of it my lady suffered. Had
the house lain by the river she might have tried to escape; but the
"camp girdled it on three sides, and on the fourth, where a swampy"
"inlet guarded one flank of the village, a deep ditch as well as the"
morass forbade all passage.
She remained in her room until she heard the unwelcome sounds which
"told of the general's return. Then she came into the outer room, her"
"eyes glittering, a red spot on either cheek, all pretence at an end."
"Her glance withered Fraulein Max, who sat blinking in a corner with a"
"very evil conscience. And to Marie Wort, when the girl came near her"
"on the pretence of adjusting her lace sleeves, she had only one word"
to say.
"'You slut!' she hissed, her breath hot on the girl's cheek. 'If you"
fail me I will kill you. Begone out of my sight!'
"The child, excited before, broke down at that, and, bursting into a"
"fit of weeping, ran out. Her sobs were still in the air when General"
Tzerclas entered.
"The Countess's face was flushed, and her bearing, full of passion and"
"defiance, must have warned him what to expect, if he felt any doubt"
"before. The sun was just setting, the room growing dusk. He stood"
"awhile, after saluting her, in doubt how he should come to the point,"
or in admiration; for her scorn and anger only increased her beauty
"and his feeling for her. At length he pointed lightly to the women,"
who kept their places by the door.
"'Is it your wish, fair cousin,' he said slowly, 'that I should speak"
"caring for her little ones, fearful to leave them alone, till at last"
"the gray light came down, down from the sky to the branches, and from"
"the branches to the ground, and she could see her way. Then, with her"
new-born babe in her arms and the elder little fellow trotting by her
"side, she went out to search for her husband. Soon enough she found him,"
"not far off, stiff and cold beside his half-cut bundle of firewood. A"
"snake had bitten him on the ankle, and he was dead."
"So Ma Pa Da was alone in the great forest, but a girl still, with two"
little children to care for.
"But she was brave, despite her trouble, and she determined to go on and"
gain some village. She took her baby in her arms and the little one by
"the hand, and started on her journey."
"And for a time all went well, till at last she came to a stream. It was"
"not very deep, but it was too deep for the little boy to wade, for it"
"came up to his neck, and his mother was not strong enough to carry both"
"at once. So, after considering for a time, she told the elder boy to"
"wait. She would cross and put the baby on the far side, and return for"
him.
"'Be good,' she said; 'be good, and stay here quietly till I come back;'"
and the boy promised.
The stream was deeper and swifter than she thought; but she went with
"great care and gained the far side, and put the baby under a tree a"
"little distance from the bank, to lie there while she went for the other"
"boy. Then, after a few minutes' rest, she went back."
"She had got to the centre of the stream, and her little boy had come"
"down to the margin to be ready for her, when she heard a rush and a cry"
Steve put it into words after his fashion. 'It must be a big place we
"are going to,' he said, about noon of the second day, 'or who is to"
"eat all this? And do you mark, Master Martin? We meet no one coming"
back. All go south. This place Nuremberg that they talk of must be
worth seeing.'
"'It should be,' I said."
And after that the excitement of the march began to take hold of me. I
"began to think and wonder, and look forward, with an eagerness I did"
"not understand, to the issues of this."
"We lay a night at Bamberg, where the crowd and confusion and the"
stress of people were so great that Steve would have it we had come to
"Nuremberg. And certainly I had never known such a hurly-burly, nor"
heard of it except at the great fair at Dantzic. The night after we
"lay at Erlangen, which we found fortified, trenched, and guarded, with"
"troops lying in the square, and the streets turned into stables. From"
that place to Nuremberg was a matter of ten miles only; but the press
was so great on the road that it took us a good part of the day to
ride from one to the other. In the open country on either side of the
way strong bodies of horse and foot were disposed. It seemed to me
that here was already an army and a camp.
"But when late in the afternoon we entered Nuremberg itself, and viewed"
"the traffic in the streets, and the endless lines of gabled houses,"
"the splendid mansions and bridges, the climbing roofs and turrets and"
"spires of this, the greatest city in Germany, then we thought little"
of all we had seen before. Here thousands upon thousands rubbed
shoulders in the streets; here continuous boats turned the river into
solid land. Here we were told were baked every day a hundred thousand
"for a fresh dwelling place, the hotel servants or the police raided"
her bedroom and found the little hoard of notes? This imagined
"danger made her want to cry. They were so friendless now, she in"
particular felt so completely deserted. Had she deserved this
punishment by Fate? Was there after all a God who minded much about
the sex foolishnesses and punished you for irregularities--for
"having lovers in your youth, for selling your virtue and inducing"
other women to sell theirs? Was she going to die soon and was there
a hereafter?' She burst out crying in an abandonment of grief.
An elderly gardener who had been snipping and sweeping in the next
house came up and vaguely recognized her as a well-known
"Bruxelloise, a good-natured lady, a foreigner who, strange to say,"
"spoke Flemish. ""Ach,"" he said, looking out where he thought lay the"
"source of her tears, at the dim view of beautiful Brussels through"
"the steamy glass, ""Onze arme, oude Brüssel."" Mrs. Warren wept"
"unrestrainedly. ""Madame is ill?"" he enquired. Mrs. Warren"
nodded--she felt indeed very ill and giddy. He left her and returned
"shortly with a small glass of Schnapps. ""If Madame is faint--?"" She"
sipped the cordial and presently felt better. Then they talked of
old times. Madame had kept the Hotel Leopold II in the Rue
"Royale? Ah, _now_ he placed her. A _superb_ establishment, always"
"well-spoken of. Her self-respect returned a little. ""Yes,"" she said,"
"""never a complaint! I looked after those girls like a mother, indeed"
"I did. Many a one married well from there."" The gardener"
"corroborated her statement, and added that her _clientèle_ had been"
of the most chic. He had a private florist's business of his own and
he had been privileged often to send bouquets to the pensionnaires
of Madame. But Madame was not alone surely in these sad times. Had
he not seen her come here with a handsome English lady who was said
to have been--to have been--fortunately--_au mieux_ with one of the
German officials?
The duke's features were hard as steel. Yet he read the other's humor
and joined him with the zest of the hour.
"""You smile once more!"" said the grim lord of the woods, turning to the"
slender form in the saddle.
"""I shall smile in the hour when the Frangipani lies at my feet,"""
"Francesco replied with heaving chest. ""It is good to be strong!"""
"The duke's horsemen were scouring ahead, keeping cover, scanning the"
"horizon for the Provencals. By noon they had left the open land,"
plunged up hills covered thick with woods. The duke's squadrons sifted
"through, and he halted them in the woods under the brow of the hill."
"Below lay a broad valley running north and south, chequered with"
pine-thickets and patches of brushwood. On a hill in the centre stood
a ruined tower. Towards the south a broad loop of the river closed the
"valley, while all around on the misty hills shimmered the giants of"
"the forest, mysterious and silent. The duke's outriders had fallen"
back and taken cover in the thickets. Down the valley could be seen a
"line of spears, glittering snake-like towards the tower on the hill."
"Companies of horse were crossing the river, pushing up the slopes,"
mass on mass. In the midst of the flickering shields and spears blew a
great banner with the Fleur-de-Lis.
"It was a contingent of Charles of Anjou, which had been on the march"
since dawn. They had thrown their advance guard across the river and
"were straggling up the green slopes, while the main host crossed the"
ford.
The sound of a clarion re-echoed from crag to crag: and down towards
were moving in and out amongst them. The French had arrived.
"The next morning, about breakfast time, the first shell burst near the"
camp--a short rapid squeal followed by a sharp report. The second shell
"burst a few minutes after, throwing up earth and smoke. A steel fragment"
came sailing over in a wide parabola and struck the foot of a man
"standing in the breakfast queue. He limped to the first-aid hut, looking"
"very pale. When he got there, he had some difficulty in finding his"
"wound, it was so slight."
We paraded and marched off. Several shells burst in the neighbouring
fields. We reached the ration dump and began to load the train. A
civilian arrived with the newspapers. Our N.C.O.'s were powerless to
stop the general stampede that surged towards the paper-vendor.
The Germans had advanced on a wide front ... Armentières had fallen. The
news was several days old and much might have happened since.
We went back to our work and discussed events. We were bullied and
"threatened with arrest, but we talked in groups while we carried cases"
of rations. Would we be involved in the advance? We might even be
captured--that would at least be an experience and a change.
In the evening a few of us went to the St. Martin to see if the old
woman and her daughter had been able to fetch their property away. We
"observed that the windows, where tinned fruit, chocolate, cakes, soap,"
"postcards, and other articles used to be exhibited, had been cleared"
completely. We entered and found one of the girls in tears:
"""All gone--all gone--I show you--you come into de cellar--all de wine"
"gone--bottles all, all broken. English soldiers come in de night and"
take everysing 'vay--ve nussing left--it's de soldiers in de camp over
"walls, considering the corners of the bulging matting on his hands and"
"knees, rummaging mantel and tables, the curtains and hangings, the"
"drunken cabinet in the corner, for a visible sign, unable to perceive"
"that she was there beside, around, against, within, above him, clinging"
"to him, wooing him, calling him so poignantly through the finer senses"
that even his grosser ones became cognisant of the call. Once again he
"answered loudly: “Yes, dear!” and turned, wild-eyed, to gaze on"
"vacancy, for he could not yet discern form and colour and love and"
"outstretched arms in the odour of mignonette. Oh, God! whence that"
"odour, and since when have odours had a voice to call? Thus he groped."
"He burrowed in crevices and corners, and found corks and cigarettes."
These he passed in passive contempt. But once he found in a fold of the
"matting a half-smoked cigar, and this he ground beneath his heel with a"
green and trenchant oath. He sifted the room from end to end. He found
dreary and ignoble small records of many a peripatetic tenant; but of
"her whom he sought, and who may have lodged there, and whose spirit"
"seemed to hover there, he found no trace."
And then he thought of the housekeeper.
He ran from the haunted room downstairs and to a door that showed a
crack of light. She came out to his knock. He smothered his excitement
as best he could.
"“Will you tell me, madam,” he besought her, “who occupied the room I"
have before I came?”
"“Yes, sir. I can tell you again. ’Twas Sprowls and Mooney, as I said."
"Miss B’retta Sprowls it was in the theatres, but Missis Mooney she was."
My house is well known for respectability. The marriage certificate
"hung, framed, on a nail over—”"
"is how to keep sober. And I want it to be understood from the start--"""
"""Not so much of it now!"" snarled Captain Dove from his cabin. ""You"
attend to your own business--and I'll attend to mine. I know how to
"behave myself--among gentlemen. And, don't you forget, either, that I'm"
"going ashore to play my own hand. I've a card or two up my sleeve,"
"Mister Slyne, that will maybe euchre your game for you--if you try to"
"bluff too high."""
"Slyne swore hotly, under his breath. He would have given a great deal to"
"know exactly what the old man meant by that mysterious threat, and only"
knew that it would be useless to ask him. There was nothing for it but
"to put up with his capricious humours, as patiently as might"
be--although Slyne shivered in anticipation of the strain that might
entail--till he could be dispensed with or got rid of altogether.
"Nor, as it presently appeared, were his fears at all ill-founded. For"
Captain Dove emerged from his cabin got up for shore-going in a guise at
sight of which Slyne could by no means suppress an involuntary groan.
"""I'm all ready now,"" Captain Dove announced. ""Will you pay for a cab if"
"I call one?"""
"""My car's waiting,"" Slyne returned, and, as the old man whistled"
amazedly over that further and unexpected proof that his former
"accomplice's fortunes had changed for the better, ""You look like a fool"
"in that outfit,"" said Slyne. ""The right rig-out for motoring is a tweed"
"suit and a soft cap."""
Captain Dove was very visibly annoyed. He had been at particular pains
"to array himself properly. ""You want to be the only swell in the party,"
"of course!"" he grunted. ""You're jealous, that's what's the matter with"
"the river played the whirlwind, with dust and clangor and the shriek"
of steel. Spears went down like trampled corn. The battle streamed
"down the bloody slope, for nothing could stand that furious charge."
"The river shut in the broken host, for the ford was narrow, not easy"
"of passage. From the north came the thundering ranks of horse, and on"
"the south the waters were calm and clear. The Provencals, streaming"
"like smoke blown from a fire by a boisterous wind, were hurled in rout"
"upon the water. They were hurled over the banks, slain in the"
"shallows, drowned in struggling to cross at the ford. Some few hundred"
"reached the southern bank, and scattered fast for the sanctuary of the"
woods.
In less than half an hour from the first charge the duke's men had won
the day. They gave no quarter; slew all who stood.
"The duke rode back up the hill, Francesco by his side, amid the cheers"
of his men.
"Southwest they rode towards the sea, their hundred lances aslant under"
the autumnal sky. They were as men challenging a kingdom with their
"swords, and they tossed their shields in the face of fate. The"
audacity of the venture set the hot blood spinning in their hearts.
To free Conradino from Anjou's clutches; to hurl damnation in the
mouth of the Provencals.
"As for Francesco, he was as a hound in leash. His sword thirsted in"
"its scabbard; he had tasted blood, and was hot for the conflict."
"On the fourth day they came upon the ruins of Ninfa, a town set upon a"
hill in a wooded valley. Vultures flapped heavenward as they rode into
"the gate; lean, red-eyed curs snarled and slinked about the streets."
"make the most of her remaining time. Sophia Wilmington, for whom she"
"had called, had already gone out. The Canon, who was engaged over his"
"correspondence, she was to meet later at the Kursaal. It was a lovely"
"morning. The line of white hotels, with their al fresco breakfast tables"
"spread temptingly on the terraces, gleamed in the sun. The _digue_ was"
"bright with summer dresses. The sands below alive with tennis players,"
"children making sand-castles, and loungers, and bathers, and horses"
moving among the bathing-machines. Yvonne tripped along with careless
tread. Her heart was in harmony with the brightness and movement and
"the glint of the sun on the sea. Once a man, meeting her smiling glance,"
"hesitated as if to speak to her, but seeing that the smile was addressed"
"to the happy world in general, he passed on his way. It was easy to"
kill time. She went down the Rue Flammande and looked at the shops. The
jewelry and the models of Paris dresses delighted her. The display
of sweets at Nopenny’s allured her within. When she returned to the
"_digue_, it was time to seek the Canon at the Kursaal."
The liveried attendants lifted their hats as she ran up the steps and
passed the barrier. She gave them a smiling “_bonjour_.” Neither the
"Canon nor any of the friends being visible on the verandah, she entered"
"the great hall, where the morning instrumental concert was going on."
"She scanned the talking, laughing crowd as she passed through. Many eyes"
"followed her. For Yvonne, when happy, was sweet to look upon. She was"
"turning back to retrace her steps, when, suddenly, a man started up from"
a group of three who were playing cards and drinking absinthe at a small
"table, and placed himself before her."
“_Tiens! c’est Yvonne!_”
She stared at him with dilated eyes and parted lips and uttered a little
gasping cry. Seeing her grow deadly white and thinking she was going to

"subject, of decent education and once respectable surroundings, gets"
"into the hands of German agents, you may be certain of one thing,"
"Dawson, that he has become a rotter through drink."""
"""That's it,"" cried Dawson. ""You have hit it. Crime and drink are twin"
brothers as no one knows better than the police. Look out for the name
and address of a man dismissed for drunkenness and we shall have our
"bird."""
"""The name I can no doubt give you, but not the address."""
"""Give us any address where he lived, even if it were ten years ago,"
and we will track him down in three days. That is just routine police
"work."""
"""I never presume to teach an expert his business--and you, Dawson, are"
"a super-expert, a director-general of those of common qualities--but"
"would it not be well to warn all the Post Offices, so that when"
another parcel is brought in addressed to the lieutenant the bearer
"may be arrested?"""
"Dawson sniffed. ""Police work; common police work. It was done at once"
for this city and fifty miles round. No parcel was put in last week.
The warning has since been extended to the whole of the United
"Kingdom. We may get our man this week, or at least a messenger of his,"
"but no news has yet come to me. I will lunch with you, as you so"
"kindly suggest, and afterwards I want you to come with me to see the"
draughtsman in the lockup. You may be able to shake his confounded
obstinacy. Run the pathetic stunt. Say if he keeps silent that you
"will be arrested, your home broken up, your family driven into the"
"workhouse, and you yourself probably shot. Pitch it strong and rich."
"Francesco climbed from the valley as the day came with splendor, a"
glow of molten gold streaming from the east. Wood and hillside
"glimmered in a smoking mist, dew-bespangled, wonderful. As the sun"
"rose, the sea stretched sudden into the arch of the west, a great"
"expanse of liquid gold. A mysterious lustre hovered over the cliffs,"
waves of light bent like saffron mist upon San Nicandro.
The dawn-light found an echo in Francesco's face. He came that
"morning the ransomer, the champion, defeated in life and hope and"
"happiness, yet with head erect, as if defying Fate. His manhood smote"
"him like the deep-throated cry of a great bell, majestic and solemn."
"The towers on the cliff were haloed with magic hues. Life, glory, joy,"
lay locked in the gray stone walls. His heart sang in him; his eyes
were afire.
As he walked his horse with a hollow thunder of hoof over the narrow
"bridge, he took his horn and blew a blast thereon. There was a sense"
"of desolation, a lifelessness about the place that smote his senses"
with a strange fear. The walls stared void against the sky. There was
"no stir, no sound within, no watchful faces at portal or wicket. Only"
the gulls circled from the cliffs and the sea made its moan along the
strand.
"Francesco sat in the saddle and looked from wall to belfry, from tower"
"to gate. There was something tragic about the place, the silence of a"
"sacked town, the ghostliness of a ship sailing the seas with a dead"
"crew upon her decks. Francesco's glance rested on the open postern, an"
empty gash in the great gate. His face darkened and his eyes lost
their sanguine glow. There was something betwixt death and worse than
death in all this calm.
him and played square. For that reason he would be equally square and
"aboveboard, and let this dirty work alone."
"That was what he _had_ decided, but now----"
"He gritted his teeth, glared fiercely around, and came to an abrupt"
stop. Every instinct of the riverman was aroused. On his left the river
dropped over short falls into a narrow gorge. It was a spot where things
"were likely to happen at any time, and where a man or two should have"
"been stationed continually. Curly knew, in fact, that there had been men"
"here all morning. They had been called away for some purpose, leaving"
the little falls unguarded. And as he stood there his practiced eyes
told him that he was beholding the very start of a jam.
"A log, plunging over the falls, upended. Another was thrust under it. A"
"third and fourth, coming down together, caught on the obstruction, all"
being held by some stones rising midstream. Before the current could
tear them loose several more timbers were forced against the mass which
"was piling up so swiftly, bridging to the opposite shore."
"To carry out that angry resolve of a minute or two ago, Curly should"
"have rolled himself another cigarette, and watched the growing damage"
with a sardonic smile. He did nothing of the sort. For a flash he had
"forgotten his grievance, and was a “river hog,” pure and simple. The"
stoppage must be broken before it reached the proportions of a real jam.
"There was no one else to do it, and so he leaped to the task without a"
second’s pause for thought.
"Upstream he ran a few feet, his eyes fixed on the surface of the river"
"above the falls. Then he saw what he wanted. An instant later, using his"
"peavey much as a pole vaulter does his pole, he leaped straight out over"
"the water, landed squarely on a big log, and was carried down to the"
"Another naked tree I would paint is the gleaming mauve-silver fig, which"
"burns its cold incandescence, tangled, like some sensitive creature"
emerged from the rock. A fig tree come forth in its nudity gleaming over
"the dark winter-earth is a sight to behold. Like some white, tangled sea"
"anemone. Ah, if it could but answer! or if we had tree-speech!"

"Yes, the steep valley sides become almost gorges, and there are trees."
"Not forests such as I had imagined, but scattered, grey, smallish oaks,"
"and some lithe chestnuts. Chestnuts with their long whips, and oaks with"
"their stubby boughs, scattered on steep hillsides where rocks crop out."
"The train perilously winding round, half way up. Then suddenly bolting"
"over a bridge and into a completely unexpected station. What is more,"
men crowd in--the station is connected with the main railway by a post
motor-omnibus.
An unexpected irruption of men--they may be miners or navvies or
land-workers. They all have huge sacks: some lovely saddle-bags with
rose-coloured flowers across the darkness. One old man is in full
"black-and-white costume, but very dirty and coming to pieces. The others"
wear the tight madder-brown breeches and sleeved waistcoats. Some have
"the sheepskin tunic, and all wear the long stocking cap. And how they"
smell! of sheep-wool and of men and goat. A rank scent fills the
carriage.
"They talk and are very lively. And they have mediaeval faces, _rusé_,"
"never really abandoning their defences for a moment, as a badger or a"
pole-cat never abandons its defences. There is none of the brotherliness
and civilised simplicity. Each man knows he must guard himself and his
own: each man knows the devil is behind the next bush. They have never
of gloom. Stars flickered in the heavens; the moon came and enveloped
the trees with silver flame. A primeval calm lay heavy upon the bosom
of the night. The spectral branches of the trees pointed rigid and
motionless towards the sky.
Francesco had left the duke gazing out upon the shimmering sea. The
voice called to him from the woods with plaintive peals of song. The
"man followed it, holding to a grass-grown track that curled at random"
into the gloom. Moonlight and shadow lay alternate upon his armor.
Hope and despair battled in his face. His soul leaped voiceless and
inarticulate into the darkened shrine of prayer.
The voice came to him clearer in the forest calm. The gulf had
"narrowed, the words flew as over the waters of Death. They were pure,"
"yet meaningless, passionate, yet void; words barbed with an utter"
"pathos, that silenced desire."
"For an hour Francesco roamed in the woods, drawing ever nearer, the"
fear in him increasing with every step. Anon the voice failed him by a
little stream that quivered dimly through the grass. A stillness that
was ghostly held the woods. The moonlight seemed to shudder on the
trees. A stupendous silence weighed upon the world.
"A hollow glade opened suddenly in the woods, a white gulf in a forest"
"gloom. Water shone there, a mere rush-ringed and full of mysterious"
"shadows, girded by the bronzed foliage of a thousand oaks. Moss grew"
"thick about the roots, dead leaves covered the grass."
"And ever and anon a dead leaf dropped silently to earth, like a hope"
that has died on the Tree of Life.
Francesco knelt in a patch of bracken and looked out over the glades.
the room where it was lying.  If she had not been ordered to give up
"nursing, that struggle would never have come.  Her heart ached, but a"
demon pressed her on and past the door.  Downstairs she just pottered
"round, dusting her china, putting in order the books which, after"
"house-cleaning, the maid had arranged almost too carefully, so that the"
first volumes of Dickens and Thackeray followed each other on the top
"shell, and the second volumes followed each other on the bottom shelf."
And all the time she thought dully: 'Why am I doing this?  What do I care
how the place looks?  It is not my home.  It can never be my home!'
"For lunch she drank some beef tea, keeping up the fiction of her"
"indisposition.  After that, she sat down at her bureau to write."
"Something must be decided!  There she sat, her forehead on her hand, and"
nothing came--not one word--not even the way to address him; just the
"date, and that was all.  At a ring of the bell she started up.  She could"
"not see anybody!  But the maid only brought a note from Aunt Rosamund,"
"and the dogs, who fell frantically on their mistress and instantly began"
"to fight for her possession. She went on her knees to separate them, and"
"enjoin peace and good-will, and their little avid tongues furiously"
licked her cheeks. Under the eager touch of those wet tongues the band
round her brain and heart gave way; she was overwhelmed with longing for
her baby. Nearly a day since she had seen her--was it possible?  Nearly a
day without sight of those solemn eyes and crinkled toes and fingers! And
"followed by the dogs, she went upstairs."
"The house was invisible from the music-room; and, spurred on by thought"
"that, until Fiorsen knew she was back, those two might be there in each"
"other's arms any moment of the day or night, Gyp wrote that evening:"
"""DEAR GUSTAV,--We are back.--GYP."""
What else in the world could she say?  He would not get it till he woke
And then he had gone his way to those who needed him more.
Mrs. Berry knelt by the bedside. Her hands were folded. She had been
"praying, but exhaustion had overcome her, and her quiet, peaceful"
breathing contrasted strangely with the other sounds that filled the
"bungalow. Mrs. Carmichael and Beatrice sat huddled close together,"
listening. They could do nothing--not even help the wounded men who
"lay so close to them. Everything was in pitch darkness, and no lights"
"were allowed. They could not go out and help in the stern, relentless"
struggle that was going on about them. They bore the woman's harder
"lot of waiting, inactive, powerless, fighting the harder battle"
against uncertainty and all the horrors of the imagination.
"""I am sorry the regiment has come,"" Mrs. Carmichael whispered. ""There"
is no doubt they will be massacred with the rest of us. What are a few
"hundreds against thousands? It is a pity. They are such fine fellows."""
"Her rough, tired voice had a ring of unconquerable pride in it. She"
was thinking of the gallant charge her husband's men had made only two
"weeks before; how they had broken through the wall of the enemy, and,"
"cheering, had rushed to meet the besieged garrison. That had been a"
"moment of rejoicing, transitory and deceptive. Then the wall closed in"
"about them again, and they knew that they were trapped."
"""Perhaps we can hold out till help comes,"" Beatrice said."
She tried not to be indifferent. For the sake of her companions she
"would gladly have felt some desire for life, but in truth it had no"
value for her. She could think of nothing but the evil she had done
and of the atonement that had been denied her. It was to no purpose
that she worked unceasingly for the wounded. The sense of
"responsibility never left her. Each moan, each death-sigh brought the"

"Fiorsen's bedroom was--as the maid would remark--""a proper pigsty""--until"
he was out of it and it could be renovated each day.  He had a talent for
"disorder, so that the room looked as if three men instead of one had gone"
"to bed in it.  Clothes and shoes, brushes, water, tumblers,"
"breakfast-tray, newspapers, French novels, and cigarette-ends--none were"
ever where they should have been; and the stale fumes from the many
cigarettes he smoked before getting up incommoded anyone whose duty it
"was to take him tea and shaving-water.  When, on that first real summer"
"day, the maid had brought Rosek up to him, he had been lying a long time"
"on his back, dreamily watching the smoke from his cigarette and four"
flies waltzing in the sunlight that filtered through the green
"sun-blinds.  This hour, before he rose, was his creative moment, when he"
could best see the form of music and feel inspiration for its rendering.
"Of late, he had been stale and wretched, all that side of him dull; but"
"this morning he felt again the delicious stir of fancy, that vibrating,"
half-dreamy state when emotion seems so easily to find shape and the mind
"pierces through to new expression.  Hearing the maid's knock, and her"
"murmured: ""Count Rosek to see you, sir,"" he thought: 'What the devil does"
"he want?' A larger nature, drifting without control, in contact with a"
"smaller one, who knows his own mind exactly, will instinctively be"
"irritable, though he may fail to grasp what his friend is after."
"And pushing the cigarette-box toward Rosek, he turned away his head.  It"
"would be money he had come about, or--that girl!  That girl--he wished"
"she was dead!  Soft, clinging creature!  A baby! God!  What a fool he had"
"been--ah, what a fool!  Such absurdity! Unheard of!  First Gyp--then her!"
He had tried to shake the girl off.  As well try to shake off a burr!
"How she clung!  He had been patient--oh, yes--patient and kind, but how"
"full of rocks, but it is straight. It will lead us somewhere, not round"
and round and round again--it will take us somewhere. And there is a
"light,' they said, 'before us, the light of a star. It is very small"
"now, but it is always steady; it never flickers or wanes. It is the star"
of Truth. Under that star we shall find that which we seek.'
"And so they went upon their road, toiling upon the rocks, falling now"
"and then, bleeding with wounds from the sharp points, sore-footed, but"
strong-hearted. And ever as they went they were farther and farther from
"the forest, farther and farther from the glades and the flowers with"
deadly scents; they heard less and less the crack of the whip of Time
falling upon the wanderers' shoulders.
"The star grew nearer and nearer, the light grew greater and greater, the"
"false lights died behind them, until at last they came out of the"
"forest, and there they found the lake that washes away all desire under"
the sun of Truth.
They had won their way. Time and Life and Fight and Struggle were behind
"them, could not follow them, as they came, weary and footsore, into the"
Great Peace.
"And of those who were left behind, of those who stayed in the glades to"
"gather the deadly flowers, to be driven ever forward by the whip of"
Time--what of them? Surely they will learn. The kindly whip of Time is
behind: he will never let them rest in such a deadly forest; they must
"go ever forward; and as they go they grow more and more weary, the"
"glades are more and more distasteful, the heavy-scented blossoms more"
and more repulsive. They will find out the thorns too. At first they
"forgot the thorns in the flowers. 'The blossoms are beautiful,' they"
"said; 'what care we for the thorns? Nay, the thorns are good. It is a"
pleasure to fight with them. What would the forest be without its
"folly. I don't doubt that he honestly thought he was dealing with me."""
"""He will have to be punished. The Admiral will insist upon that."""
"""We must make the punishment as light as we can. You shall help me"
with all the discretionary authority with which you are equipped. I
"can see, Dawson, from the tactful skill with which you have dealt with"
me that discretion is among your most distinguished characteristics.
"If you had been a stupid, bull-headed policeman, you would have been"
"up against pretty serious trouble."""
"""That was quite my own view,"" replied Dawson drily."
"""Who is the man described by our erring draughtsman?"""
"""He won't say. We have put on every allowable method of pressure, and"
some that are not in ordinary times permitted. We have had over this
spy hunt business to shed most of our tender English regard for
"suspected persons, and to adopt the French system of fishing"
inquiries. In France the police try to make a man incriminate himself;
in England we try our hardest to prevent him. That may be very right
"and just in peace time against ordinary law breakers; but war is war,"
and spies are too dangerous to be treated tenderly. We have
"cross-examined the man, and bully-ragged him, but he won't give up the"
name of his accomplice. It may be a relation. One thing seems sure.
"The man is, or was, a member of your staff, engaged in shipyard"
inquiries. Can you give me a list of the men who are or have been on
"this sort of work during the past few years?"""
"""I will get it for you. But please use it carefully. My present men"
"are precious jewels, the few left to me by zealous military"
authorities. What I must look for is some one over military age who
He dismounted and left his steed on the bridge. The postern beckoned
"to him. He went in like a man nerved for peril, with sword drawn and"
"shield in readiness. Again he blew his horn. No living being answered,"
no voice broke the silence.
"The refectory was open, the door standing half ajar. Francesco thrust"
it full open with the point of his sword and looked in. A gray light
filtered through the narrow windows. The nuns lay huddled on benches
"and on the floor. Some lay fallen across the settles, others sat with"
their heads fallen forward upon the table; a few had crawled towards
the door and had died in the attempt to escape. The shadow of death
was over the whole.
Francesco's face was as gray as the faces of the dead. There was
"something here, a horror, a mystery, that hurled back the warm courage"
of the heart.
"With frantic despair he rushed from one body to the other, turning the"
"dead faces to the light, fearing every one must be that of his own"
"Ilaria. But Ilaria was not among them; the mystery grew deeper, grew"
"more unfathomable. For a moment, Francesco stood among the dead nuns"
"as if every nerve in his body had been suddenly paralyzed, when his"
"eyes fell upon a crystal chalice, half overturned on the floor. It"
contained the remnants of a clear fluid. He picked it up and held it
to his nostrils. It fell from his nerveless fingers upon the stone and
"broke into a thousand fragments, a thin stream creeping over the"
granite towards the fallen dead. It was a preparation of hemlock and
"bitter almonds. He stared aghast, afraid to move, afraid to call. The"
nuns had poisoned themselves.
"Like a madman he rushed out into the adjoining corridor, hither and"
"thither, in the frantic endeavor to find a trace of Ilaria. Yet not a"
"the foliage, still flashes and dominates the landscape. Ha-ha! proud"
"mankind! There you ride! But alas, most of the men are still"
"khaki-muffled, rabbit-indistinguishable, ignominious. The Italians look"
curiously rabbity in the grey-green uniform: just as our sand-colored
"khaki men look doggy. They seem to scuffle rather abased, ignominious"
"on the earth. Give us back the scarlet and gold, and devil take the"
hindmost.
*       *       *       *       *
The landscape really begins to change. The hillsides tilt sharper and
"sharper. A man is ploughing with two small red cattle on a craggy,"
tree-hanging slope as sharp as a roof-side. He stoops at the small
"wooden plough, and jerks the ploughlines. The oxen lift their noses to"
"heaven, with a strange and beseeching snake-like movement, and taking"
"tiny little steps with their frail feet, move slantingly across the"
"slope-face, between rocks and tree-roots. Little, frail, jerky steps the"
"bullocks take, and again they put their horns back and lift their"
"muzzles snakily to heaven, as the man pulls the line. And he skids his"
wooden plough round another scoop of earth. It is marvellous how they
"hang upon that steep, craggy slope. An English labourer's eyes would"
bolt out of his head at the sight.
There is a stream: actually a long tress of a water-fall pouring into a
"little gorge, and a stream-bed that opens a little, and shows a"
marvellous cluster of naked poplars away below. They are like ghosts.
"They have a ghostly, almost phosphorescent luminousness in the shadow of"
"the valley, by the stream of water. If not phosphorescent, then"
"incandescent: a grey, goldish-pale incandescence of naked limbs and"
"myriad cold-glowing twigs, gleaming strangely. If I were a painter I"
"would paint them: for they seem to have living, sentient flesh. And the"
shadow envelopes them.
"all thought, and think still, that I was a messenger from the"
"_Malplaquet_, which, by the way, is well down the river safe and"
"sound. Just wait a minute."" He walked into a corner of the room, moved"
"his hands quickly between his side pockets and his face, and then"
"returned. Except for the dark hair and moustache and the brown skin,"
"he had become the Dawson of the Thursday afternoon. ""It is as simple"
"for me to change,"" said the artist, with a nasty look in my direction,"
"""as it seems to be for Mr. Copplestone here to spot me. It will take a"
day or two to get the dye out of my hair and the tan off my skin. I am
"going to have a sharp touch of influenza, which is a useful disease"
"when one wants to lie in. Since Sunday I have only been twice to bed."""
We filled him up with coffee and flattery--as one fills a motor car
with petrol and oil--but asked him no questions until we were safely
in Cary's study and Mrs. Cary had gone about her household duties.
"""Your good lady,"" remarked Dawson to Cary, ""is as little curious as"
"any woman I have met, and we will leave her at that if you don't mind."
The best thing about our women is that they don't care tuppence about
"naval and military details. If they did, and once started prying with"
"that keen scent and indomitable persistence of theirs, we might as"
well chuck up. Even my own bright team of charmers never know and
never ask the meaning of the information that they ferret out for me.
"Their curiosity is all personal--about men and women, never about"
"things. Women--"""
I cut Dawson short. He tended to become tedious.
"""Quite so,"" I observed politely. ""And to revert to one big female"
"creature, let us hear something of the _Malplaquet_."""
"""You at any rate are curious enough for a dozen. It would serve you"
right to keep you hopping a bit longer. But I have a kindly eye for
"We said Good-night to our three railway friends, and went up to bed. We"
"had only been in the room a minute or two, when the brown woman tapped:"
"and if you please, the black-cap had sent us one of his little white"
loaves. We were really touched. Such delicate little generosities have
almost disappeared from the world.
"It was a queer little bread--three-cornered, and almost as hard as ships"
"biscuit, made of starch flour. Not strictly bread at all."

"The night was cold, the blankets flat and heavy, but one slept quite"
"well till dawn. At seven o'clock it was a clear, cold morning, the sun"
"not yet up. Standing at the bedroom window looking out, I could hardly"
"believe my eyes it was so like England, like Cornwall in the bleak"
"parts, or Derbyshire uplands. There was a little paddock-garden at the"
"back of the Station, rather tumble-down, with two sheep in it. There"
"were several forlorn-looking out-buildings, very like Cornwall. And then"
"the wide, forlorn country road stretched away between borders of grass"
"and low, drystone walls, towards a grey stone farm with a tuft of trees,"
"and a naked stone village in the distance. The sun came up yellow, the"
"bleak country glimmered bluish and reluctant. The low, green hill-slopes"
"were divided into fields, with low drystone walls and ditches. Here and"
"there a stone barn rose alone, or with a few bare, windy trees attached."
"Two rough-coated winter horses pastured on the rough grass, a boy came"
"along the naked, wide, grass-bordered high-road with a couple of milk"
"cans, drifting in from nowhere: and it was all so like Cornwall, or a"
"part of Ireland, that the old nostalgia for the Celtic regions began to"
"spring up in me. Ah, those old, drystone walls dividing the fields--pale"
"and granite-blenched! Ah, the dark, sombre grass, the naked sky! the"
"forlorn horses in the wintry morning! Strange is a Celtic landscape, far"
"more moving, disturbing than the lovely glamor of Italy and Greece."
"""Bring hither coffee and a dish of eggs for two. The wind and rain yet"
howl around the house.  This gentleman will sup with me ere we go home.
"Go and serve us quickly, for we have both a good stomach, and would eat"
"ere we depart hence."""
"The tapster vanished quickly to do the bidding of the guests, and Grey"
"turned a wondering glance upon the Old Lion, whose face, framed in its"
"shaggy gray hair, looked more leonine than ever, the bright eyes shining"
"out of deep caverns from under bushy brows, the rugged features full of"
"power, not unmixed with a curious underlying ferocity.  But the glance"
bent upon Grey was kindly enough.
"""Sit down, young man; I would know more of you.  I have a gift for"
reading faces.  I have marked yours ever since you entered this room.
"Tell me your name.  Tell me of yourself, for you were not born to the"
"state to which you have now fallen."""
"""My name is Grey,"" was the ready answer.  Grey had dropped his title and"
"patronymic with his fallen fortunes, and used his mother’s name alone."
"""My father was a country gentleman.  I was gently reared, and was at one"
"time a scholar at Oxford, where I dreamed many dreams.  Afterwards I"
"travelled abroad, returning to find my father dead and my home in the"
hands of a kinsman to whom it was mortgaged by my father.  The small
fortune I received I squandered foolishly in a few weeks of gay living
with young bloods of the town.  I wakened from my dream to find myself
"well-nigh penniless, disgusted alike with myself and those I had called"
my friends. I have ever been something ambitious.  I misdoubt me I am a
fool; but I did think that I might win laurels upon the field of
"literature.  I have never lost the trick of rhyming, and jotting down"
"such things as pleased my fancy, whether in prose or in verse. Do I"
"weary you with my tale?"""
"""Ah, there is too much socialism everywhere!"" cried the q-b."
"""Ma--perhaps, perhaps--"" said the discreet Sicilian. She saw which way"
"the land lay, and added:"
"""Si vuole un _pocchetino_ di Socialismo: one wants a tiny bit of"
"socialism in the world, a tiny bit. But not much. Not much. At present"
"there is too much."""
"Our host, twinkling at this speech which treated of the sacred creed as"
"if it were a pinch of salt in the broth, believing the q-b was throwing"
"dust in his eyes, and thoroughly intrigued by us as a pair of deep ones,"
retired. No sooner had he gone than the lamp-flame stood up at its full
"length, and started to whistle. The q-b drew back. Not satisfied by"
"this, another flame suddenly began to whip round the bottom of the"
"burner, like a lion lashing its tail. Unnerved, we made room: the q-b"
cried again: in came the host with a subtle smile and a pin and an air
"of benevolence, and tamed the brute."
"What else was there to eat? There was a piece of fried pork for me, and"
"boiled eggs for the q-b. As we were proceeding with these, in came the"
"remainder of the night's entertainment: three station officials, two in"
"scarlet peaked caps, one in a black-and-gold peaked cap. They sat down"
"with a clamour, in their caps, as if there was a sort of invisible"
screen between us and them. They were young. The black cap had a lean
"and sardonic look: one of the red-caps was little and ruddy, very young,"
"with a little mustache: we called him the _maialino_, the gay little"
"black pig, he was so plump and food-nourished and frisky. The third was"
rather puffy and pale and had spectacles. They all seemed to present us
"the blank side of their cheek, and to intimate that no, they were not"
"going to take their hats off, even if it were dinner-table and a strange"
"_signora_. And they made rough quips with one another, still as if we"
"human weakness, though you might not think it. I joined the ship on"
"Thursday afternoon, slipping in as one of a detachment of fifty"
R.M.L.I. who had been wired for from Chatham. They were an emergency
lot; we hadn't enough in the ship for the double sentry go that I
"wanted. All my plans were made with the Commander and Major Boyle, and"
they both did exactly what I told them. It isn't often that a private
of Marines has the ordering about of two officers. But Dawson is
"Dawson; no common man. They did as I told them, and were glad to do"
it. I had extra light bulbs put on all over the lower decks and every
dark corner lit up--except one. Just one. And this one was where the
four gun-cables ran out of the switch-room and lay alongside one
another before they branched off to the fore and after turrets and to
the port and starboard side batteries. That was the most likely spot
"which any one wanting to cut the gun-wires would mark down, and I"
meant to watch it pretty closely myself. We had double sentries at the
"magazines. The _Malplaquet_ is an oil-fired ship, so we hadn't any"
bothering coal bunkers to attract fancy bombs. I was pretty sure that
after the _Antinous_ and the _Antigone_ we had mostly wire-cutting to
"fear. When a man has done one job successfully, and repeated it almost"
"successfully, he is pretty certain to have a third shot. Besides, if"
"one is out to delay a ship, cutting wires is as good a way as any. I"
"had an idea that my man was not a bomber."""
"""I thought that you scorned theories,"" I put in dryly. ""When they are"
"wrong they mislead you, and when they are right they are no help."""
"Dawson frowned. ""Shut up, Copplestone,"" snapped Cary."
"""We were in no danger from the lighting, heating, and telephone wires,"
for any defect would have been visible at once. It was the gun and
gunnery control cables that were the weak spots. So I had L.T.O.'s
"posted in the spotting top, the conning tower, the transmission room,"
moment that he was indeed the thrice-famous José Maria of Ronda. None
"asked a question as to his whence or whither. He was José Maria, and"
therefore entitled not only to be taken at once into the secrets of
"Egypt, but also, and it pleased him, to keep his own."
And very desperate and bloody some of 'his own' were. In the present
"instance, plunder and bloodshed were to proceed hand in hand. No quarter"
was to be given to old or young. The plague-stricken sick man and the
"watcher by the bed, the woman feeding her fire of sticks under her"
"_puchero_, the child asleep on its pillow, the Queen in the palace, the"
"Princess in her nursery--all were to die, quickly and suddenly. These"
men had sworn it. The dead were no tale-tellers. That was the way of
Egypt--the ancient way of safety. Were they not few and feeble in the
midst of innumerable hordes of the _Busne_? Had they not been driven
"like cattle, abused like dogs, sent guiltless to the scaffold, shot in"
"batches by both warring parties? Now in this one place at least, they"
would do a deed of vengeance at which the ears of the world would
tingle.
The Sergeant sat and smoked and listened. He was no stranger to such
talk. It was the way of his double profession of Andalucian bandit and
"Carlist _guerrilero_, to devise and execute deeds of terror and death."
But nothing so cold-blooded as this had José Maria ever imagined. He had
indeed appropriated the governmental mails till the post-bags almost
"seemed his own property, and the guards handed them down without"
"question as to a recognised official. He had, in his great days,"
captured towns and held them for either party according to the good the
matter was likely to do himself. But there was something revolting in
this whole business which puzzled him.
"""Whose idea was all this?"" he asked at last. ""I would give much to see"
"the _Gitano_ who could devise such a stroke."""
grandchildren--was chuntering her head off because it was _her_
seat--why she had left it she didn't say. And under my legs was her
"bundle of bread. She nearly went off her head. And over my head, on the"
"little rack, was her bercola, her saddle-bag. Fat soldiers laughed at"
"her good-naturedly, but she fluttered and flipped like a tart,"
featherless old hen. Since she had another seat and was quite
"comfortable, we smiled and let her chunter. So she clawed her bread"
"bundle from under my legs, and, clutching it and a fat child, sat tense."

It was getting quite dark. The conductor came and said that there was no
"more paraffin. If what there was in the lamps gave out, we should have"
to sit in the dark. There was no more paraffin all along the line.--So
"he climbed on the seats, and after a long struggle, with various boys"
"striking matches for him, he managed to obtain a light as big as a pea."
"We sat in this _clair-obscur_, and looked at the sombre-shadowed faces"
"round us: the fat soldier with a gun, the handsome soldier with huge"
"saddle-bags, the weird, dark little man who kept exchanging a baby with"
"a solid woman who had a white cloth tied round her head, a tall"
"peasant-woman in costume, who darted out at a dark station and returned"
"triumphant with a piece of chocolate: a young and interested young man,"
who told us every station. And the man who spat: there is always one.
"Gradually the crowd thinned. At a station we saw our fat friend go by,"
"bitterly, like a betrayed soul, his bulging saddle-bag hanging before"
"and after, but no comfort in it now--no comfort. The pea of light from"
"the paraffin lamp grew smaller. We sat in incredible dimness, and the"
"smell of sheeps-wool and peasant, with only our fat and stoic young man"
to tell us where we were. The other dusky faces began to sink into a
"dead, gloomy silence. Some took to sleep. And the little train ran on"
"and on, through unknown Sardinian darkness. In despair we drained the"
"would often be waylaid and forced to release them. An old woman, say,"
"anxious to do some deed of merit, would come to him as he returned"
"triumphantly home with his fowls and tender him money, and beg him to"
release the fowls. She would give the full price or double the price of
"the fowls; she had no desire to gain merit at another person's expense,"
and the unwilling cook would be obliged to give up the fowls. Public
"opinion was so strong he dare not refuse. The money was paid, the fowls"
"set free, and I dined on tinned beef."
And yet the villages are full of fowls. Why they are kept I do not know.
Certainly not for food. I do not mean to say that an accidental meeting
"between a rock and a fowl may not occasionally furnish forth a dinner,"
but this is not the object with which they are kept--of this I am sure.
You would not suppose that fowls were capable of exciting much
"affection, yet I suppose they are. Certainly in one case ducks were."
There is a Burman lady I know who is married to an Englishman. He kept
"ducks. He bought a number of ducklings, and had them fed up so that they"
might be fat and succulent when the time came for them to be served at
"table. They became very fine ducks, and my friend had promised me one. I"
"took an interest in them, and always noticed their increasing fatness"
"when I rode that way. Imagine, then, my disappointment when one day I"
saw that all the ducks had disappeared.
"I stopped to inquire. Yes, truly they were all gone, my friend told me."
"In his absence his wife had gone up the river to visit some friends, and"
"had taken the ducks with her. She could not bear, she said, that they"
"should be killed, so she took them away and distributed them among her"
"friends, one here and one there, where she was sure they would be well"
treated and not killed. When she returned she was quite pleased at her
"success, and laughed at her husband and me."
"for company, and a few guineas in our pockets, need not fear the future;"
and I trow it will be well for you to be quit for ever of my Lord
Sandford’s company.  I liked him not greatly for your friend; I hate him
with a goodly hatred since he shows himself your foe.  Shall we turn our
"backs upon him and upon London town, and seek our fortunes with the army"
"over the water, where his Grace of Marlborough will give you welcome?"""
"""I scarce know what the future will bring for me, Dicon,"" was the reply,"
"spoken gravely, yet with a certain listless indifference not lost upon"
"the servant; ""I have made no plans as yet.  Let us see what this day"
"brings forth first."""
"""I wager it will fill our pockets anew with gold!"""
"""I will not touch their gold!"" spoke Grey with eyes that suddenly"
"flashed fire.  ""I have cancelled all my wagers.  I will take nothing at"
their hands. I will ride Don Carlos and ride my best for mine own honour
and that of the good steed I shall bestride; but their money will I not
"touch.  I have done with all that.  Nay, stare not in such amaze, good"
"Dicon.  I have not taken leave of my senses; rather, I trow, I have come"
"to my better mind.  Now get me somewhat to eat here, and then we will to"
"the stables to see my beauty. This match once over, we turn a new page"
"in our life’s story.  Who knows what the next will be?"""
It was not much that Grey could eat.  The three days which had passed
"since he and Lord Sandford had come to an understanding, which was"
"well-nigh a rupture, had left a mark upon him.  Moreover there was a"
"weary ache at his heart which he did not fully understand, and which was"
harder to bear than aught beside.  Dimly he knew that it had some
connection with the Lady Geraldine Adair; but he feared to search too
deeply into that matter.  She was as far removed from him as the moon in
"the heavens, and he believed her plighted to another, and that one a man"
"swarm of angry wasps, and above us they seemed to remain, hovering and"
circling. We awaited the downward rush and the deafening thunder-clap
that would destroy us all. One man was groaning loudly. Another
shivered. I could hear the chattering of many teeth. My neighbour
trembled violently and cowered beneath his blankets. But his fear grew
so strong that he could not bear it any longer. He got up and said in a
"strained voice, trying to appear calm, ""I'm goin' to 'ave a look at"
"'em."" He ran out of the marquee and disappeared. I found my powers of"
resistance ebbing. I was unable to control my imagination. I saw my
comrades and myself blown to pieces. I saw the clerk in the office of
the C.C.S. write out the death-intimations on a buff slip and filling in
a form. I saw a telegraph boy taking the telegram to my home. He stopped
on the way in order to talk to a friend. Then he whistled and threw a
stone at a dog. He sauntered through the garden gate and knocked at the
"front door. The door opened ... but I could not face the rest, and with"
a tremendous mental impulse I turned my mind away to other things. But
my terrible thoughts lay in wait for me like tigers ready to rush upon
"me as soon as my will relaxed its efforts. I tried to compromise, and I"
imagined myself killed and invented all the details of a post-mortem
"examination and burial. I found some relief in these imaginings, but"
soon that implacable telegram claimed my attention once more and drew me
on to what I dared not face. I sought distraction by muttering some
"verses of poetry to myself. They had no meaning to me, they were just"
empty sound and their rhythm had a hideous pulsation like that other
pulsation overhead:
"""He above the rest"
In shape and gesture proudly eminent
"Stood like a tower...."""
"and so on, line after line. The dreariness of the verses grew so intense"
as to be almost intolerable. At the same time I was dimly conscious of
"altered the fine and youthful contours of her cheek, nor subdued the"
arch though resolute curve of her lips.
A tall young man came striding through the park along the path near
which she sat. Behind him tagged a boy carrying a suit-case. At sight
"of the young lady, the man’s face changed to red and back to pale"
"again. He watched her countenance as he drew nearer, with hope and"
"anxiety mingled on his own. He passed within a few yards of her, but he"
saw no evidence that she was aware of his presence or existence.
Some fifty yards further on he suddenly stopped and sat on a bench at
one side. The boy dropped the suit-case and stared at him with
"wondering, shrewd eyes. The young man took out his handkerchief and"
"wiped his brow. It was a good handkerchief, a good brow, and the young"
man was good to look at. He said to the boy:
“I want you to take a message to that young lady on that bench. Tell
"her I am on my way to the station, to leave for San Francisco, where I"
"shall join that Alaska moose-hunting expedition. Tell her that, since"
"she has commanded me neither to speak nor to write to her, I take this"
"means of making one last appeal to her sense of justice, for the sake"
of what has been. Tell her that to condemn and discard one who has not
"deserved such treatment, without giving him her reasons or a chance to"
explain is contrary to her nature as I believe it to be. Tell her that
"I have thus, to a certain degree, disobeyed her injunctions, in the"
"hope that she may yet be inclined to see justice done. Go, and tell her"
that.”
The young man dropped a half-dollar into the boy’s hand. The boy looked
"at him for a moment with bright, canny eyes out of a dirty, intelligent"
"face, and then set off at a run. He approached the lady on the bench a"
"little doubtfully, but unembarrassed. He touched the brim of the old"
"her back. ""What have you in your bag, granny?"" asked the merchant. ""O,"
"it is only a cat! I can feed her no longer, and so I want to throw her"
"into the sea in order to get rid of her,"" said the old woman. ""The boy"
"told me to buy whatever I could get for the four-shilling piece,"" said"
"the merchant to himself, and asked the woman whether he could have her"
"cat for four shillings. The woman agreed without delay, and the bargain"
was closed.
"Now when the merchant had sailed on for a while, a terrible storm broke"
"loose, a thunderstorm without an equal, and he drifted and drifted, and"
did not know where or whither. At last he came to a land where he had
"never yet been, and went up into the city."
"In the tavern which he entered the table was set, and at every place lay"
"a switch, one for each guest. This seemed strange to the merchant, for"
he could not understand what was to be done with all the switches. Yet
"he sat down and thought: ""I will watch carefully, and see just what the"
"rest do with them, and then I can imitate them."" Yes, and when the food"
"came on the table, then he knew why the switches were there: the place"
"was alive with thousands of mice, and all who were sitting at the table"
"had to work and fight and beat about them with their switches, and"
"nothing could be heard but the slapping of the switches, one worse than"
"the other. Sometimes people hit each other in the face, and then they"
"had to take time to say, ""Excuse me!"""
"""Eating is hard work in this country,"" said the merchant. ""How is it"
"the folk here have no cats?"" ""Cats?"" said the people: they did not know"
what they were. Then the merchant had the cat that he had bought for the
"scullion brought, and when the cat went over the table, the mice had to"
"hurry into their holes, and not in the memory of man had the people been"
able to eat in such comfort. Then they begged and implored the merchant
to sell them his cat. At last he said he would let them have her; but he
"the custom of other snakes, he will not flee on hearing a footstep. When"
"anyone approaches he lies more still than ever, not even a movement of"
"his head betraying him. He is so like the colour of the ground, he hopes"
"he will be passed unseen; and he is slow and lethargic in his movements,"
"and so is easy to kill when once detected. As a Burman said, 'If he sees"
"you first, he kills you; if you see him first, you kill him.'"
In this district no Burman hesitates a moment in killing a viper when
he has the chance. Usually he has to do it in self-defence. This viper
"is terribly feared, as over a hundred persons a year die here by his"
bite. He is so hated and feared that he has become an outcast from the
law that protects all life.
"But with other snakes it is not so. There is the hamadryad, for"
"instance. He is a great snake about ten to fourteen feet long, and he is"
"the only snake that will attack you first. He is said always to do so,"
certainly he often does. One attacked me once when out quail-shooting.
He put up his great neck and head suddenly at a distance of only five or
"six feet, and was just preparing to strike, when I literally blew his"
head off with two charges of shot.
You would suppose he was vicious enough to be included with the
"Russell's viper in the category of the exceptions, but no. Perhaps he is"
too rare to excite such fierce and deadly hate as makes the Burman
"forget his law and kill the viper. However it may be, the Burman is not"
ready to kill the hamadryad. A few weeks ago a friend of mine and myself
came across two little Burman boys carrying a jar with a piece of broken
"tile over it. The lads kept lifting up the tile and peeping in, and then"
"putting the tile on again in a great hurry, and their actions excited"
"our curiosity. So we called them to come to us, and we looked into the"
jar. It was full of baby hamadryads. The lads had found a nest of them
"in the absence of the mother, who would have killed them if she had"
"London, with its subdued lights, lay all around me. It had not changed"
"since I saw it last, and yet I felt it ought to have changed. The reason"
was that I had changed. And then I began to fear that I had changed
beyond the power of recovery. The oppressive sensation that I was in a
dream forced itself upon me. I felt that there was only one reality in
the whole world--the war. Would I ever escape from the war? It would
"come to an end some day, and I would leave the army, but would not the"
war obsess me until the end of my life? Would I ever be myself again?
But this was not the way to enjoy my leave! I began to feel
disappointed at not being so happy as I had expected to be. Why was I
not full of rapture? Why did not every object fill me with delight? But
I ought to have known that habitual discontent and bitterness and revolt
"are not shaken off in a few hours or a few days, and that they persist"
even after their immediate cause has been removed.
I looked round at the other people sitting on the 'bus. I had visited
"foreign countries in former years, but never before had I felt that I"
"was amongst complete strangers. There are moments when a dog, a horse,"
or a bird fills us with a sense of the uncanny--its mind is an insoluble
"mystery, with depths so dark and inscrutable that one feels something"
that approaches fear and horror. And so it was as I sat on the 'bus. The
civilians around me seemed like animals of a different species. They
were not human at all--or was it I who was not human?
I went to another seat in order to listen to a man and woman who were
"talking together. I felt that if they were to talk about the war, the"
"uncanny spell would be broken, the dream would dissolve and I would be"
restored to my own fellow creatures. But they spoke about trivial
domestic matters and about a flower show. If they had only mentioned the
"word ""war"" I would have felt relieved by its familiarity, but they did"
not mention it once.
I suppose that he pads them out with little rubber insets. He alters
"his voice, and his figure, and even his height. He can be stiff and"
"upright like a drilled soldier, or loose-jointed and shambling like a"
"tramp. He is a finished artist, and employs the very simplest means."
"He could, I truly believe, deceive his wife or his mother, but he will"
never again deceive me. I am not a specially observant man; still one
"can make a shot at most things when driven to it, and I object to"
"being the subject of Dawson's ribaldry. If you will take my tip, you"
"will be able to spot him as readily as I do now."""
"""Good. I should love to score off Dawson. He is an aggravating beast."""
"""Study his ears,"" said I. ""He cannot alter their chief characters. The"
"lobes of his ears are not loose, like yours or mine or those of most"
men and women; his are attached to the back of his cheekbones. My
"mother had lobes like those, so had the real Roger Tichborne; I"
noticed Dawson's at once. Also at the top fold of his ears he has
"rather a pronounced blob of flesh. This blob, more prominent in some"
"men than in others, is, I believe, a surviving relic of the sharp"
point which adorned the ears of our animal ancestors. Dawson's
ancestor must have been a wolf or a bloodhound. Whenever now I have a
"strange caller who is not far too tall or far too short to be Dawson,"
"if a stranger stops me in the street to ask for a direction, if a"
"porter at a station dashes up to help me with my bag, I go for his"
ears. If the lobes are attached to the cheekbones and there is a
"pronounced blob in the fold at the top, I address the man instantly as"
"Dawson, however impossibly unlike Dawson he may be. I have spotted him"
"twice now since he bowled me out, and he is frightfully savage--especially"
as I won't tell him how the trick is done. He says that it is my duty to
"tell him, and that he will compel me under some of his beloved Defence of"
the Realm Regulations. But the rack could not force me to give away my
"precious secret. Cherish it and use it. You will not tell, for you love"
"Once upon a time there was a poor woman, who lived in a wretched hut far"
"away from the village. She had but little to bite and less to burn, so"
she sent her little boy to the forest to gather wood. He skipped and
"leaped, and leaped and skipped, in order to keep warm, for it was a"
"cold, gray autumn day, and whenever he had gathered a root or a branch"
"to add to his bundle, he had to slap his arms against his shoulders, for"
the cold made his hands as red as the whortleberry bushes over which he
"walked. When he had filled his barrow, and was wandering homeward, he"
"crossed a field of stubble. There he saw lying a jagged white stone. ""O,"
"you poor old stone, how white and pale you are! You must be freezing"
"terribly!"" said the boy; took off his jacket, and laid it over the"
"stone. And when he came back home with his wood, his mother asked"
him how it was that he was going around in the autumn cold in his
"shirt-sleeves. He told her that he had seen a jagged old stone, quite"
"white and pale with the frost, and that he had given it his jacket. ""You"
"fool,"" said the woman, ""do you think a stone can freeze? And even if it"
"had chattered with frost, still, charity begins at home. Your clothes"
"cost enough as it is, even when you don't hang them on the stones out"
"in the field!""--and with that she drove the boy out again to fetch his"
"jacket. When he came to the stone, the stone had turned around, and had"
"raised itself from the ground on one side. ""Yes, and I'm sure it is"
"because you have the jacket, poor fellow!"" said the boy. But when he"
"looked more closely, there was a chest full of bright silver coins under"
"the stone. ""That must be stolen money,"" thought the boy, ""for no one"
"lays money honestly earned under stones in the wood."" And he took the"
"chest, and carried it down to the pond nearby, and threw in the whole"
pile of money. But a four-shilling piece was left swimming on the top
"of the water. ""Well, this one is honest, for whatever is honest will"
"float,"" said the boy. And he took the four-shilling piece and the jacket"
"home with him. He told his mother what had happened to him, that the"
"stone had turned around, and that he had found a chest full of silver"
"though he could not read it then and there, he could see, by casting his"
"eyes over it, that there were many very fine periods in it, and that it"
"was filled with descriptive passages of some great battle, and the"
energy and glory of the General in command. He raised his eyes
"inquiringly to the impassioned face of the author, which was working"
with excitement.
"""See you not something of the form?  It is a dramatic interlude.  It"
should be played upon the stage during the intervals of the play.  Time
"sits aloft, aged and grim, his scythe in his hand, his hour-glass beside"
"him, and he speaks of the decay of mankind—that the world’s greatness is"
"vanishing, its men of genius growing ever fewer and fewer.  That is my"
part.  I take the _rôle_ of Time.  To him then enters one in the guise
of youth—one in the flush of manhood’s prime—one who has seen great and
"doughty deeds, and comes to rehearse the same in the ears of old Time,"
"to bid him change his tune, to tell him that giants yet live upon the"
earth.  This youth comes with songs of victory; he speaks of what he has
seen; he describes in burning words and glowing colours that last great
fight wherein England’s General put to flight the hosts of the haughty
monarch of France.  For months has this been written; for months have I
gone about seeking the man to take the part of youth and manhood. But I
have sought in vain.  All those whom I would have chosen have other work
"to do, and did but laugh at me.  Those who would gladly do my bidding, I"
"will none of.  You saw how they did mouth and rant to-night, thinking to"
"show their talent, when they only displayed their imbecile folly. But"
here have I found the very man for whom I have long waited.  You have
"youth, beauty—that manly beauty which transcends, to my thinking, the"
ephemeral loveliness of woman; you have the gift; you have seen the
"great hero: you have caught the very trick of his words and speech.  Oh,"
"I know it!  Once did I hear him address the House of Lords, and when you"
spoke I seemed to see and hear him again.  The great world of fashion
will go mad over you.  We shall draw full houses; we shall succeed.  I

-Shit.
-You have been deemed hazardous.
"-Spoon, watch out, man!"
"-Thanks a lot, Farber."
"Oh, mother-damn!"
She shot at you with her eyes closed!
-Did you shoot with your eyes closed?
"-lt worked, didn't it?"
"She is shit-hot, man."
Put in a good word for me.
-Stop cussing.
-And go home.
I got you.
Aim and fire.
I keep expecting the Marines or Air Force.
"Hell, I'll take the cavalry."
Defense Department uses all USR contracts.
Why didn't you just hand the world over on a silver platter?
Maybe we did.
Robertson has the uplink control in his office.
Service areas.
No surveillance.
-Fire alarm.
-He must have evacuated the building.
Everything's locked down.
"But don't worry, I've got a man inside."
-Dr.
"All right, I want to conduct."
You can't conduct.
I want to conduct!
No!
Let Wilbur conduct.
MAN 1:
Let Wilbur conduct!
MAN 2:
"Go ahead, Wilbur!"
"Now by popular demand, we bring you the interstate choir conducted by Wilbur Hoolick!"
Good luck.
"Oh, don't go, Mr. Miles."
Help me out with this number.
What number is it?
I Like to Hike.
"So do I, but what's the song?"
"I Like to Hike is the name of the song, and do it with dignity."
Dignity!
"Oh, yeah."
I...
I'll be dignity.

"Selena, I don't want to wait that long."
I want to marry you now and become a lawyer too.
"Honey, don't cry."
It's nothing to cry about.
"Please go, Ted."
Just go.
Okay.
I guess I picked the wrong time.
"I'll come back tomorrow, when you're feeling better."
"Morning, Mrs. MacKenzie."
"Why, Nellie you didn't have to come to work today."
Work keeps my mind off of things.
"Selena's all right now, isn't she?"
She'll be back to the store tomorrow.
"Everything is just trouble, Mrs. MacKenzie."
Just trouble.
"Nellie, don't do any work today."
Just sit around and relax.
"Happy Labor Day, Mother."
Something's wrong.
She's upset.
"Can't blame her, with Lucas gone and nobody knows where he is."
I've gotta run.
Bye.
"- Hi, Norman."
- Hi.
- How are you?
- Fine.
Come on.
"Hello, Mike."
Where'd you come from?
- Back there.
Not yet.
- One day.
- Mm.
Ah.
Another?
- What the hell is that?
- Get it down you.
Is there no chance of them getting back together?
Mum and Dad?
No way!
#... around me
"# Inside I'm feelin', oh, so cold"
"# Oh, yes..."
"So, tell me about London."
I don't see it.
Underground most of the time.
Underground?
"Er, yeah."
I'm a tube driver too.
"A writer who also drives a tube train, eh?"
Very glamorous.
"Research for your novel, I suppose."
Yeah.
That's right.
It's all about a tube driver.
"Handsome, comes to the Lake District, meets this feisty, young girl who gives him a really fucking hard time, and they get drunk."
"Oh, yeah?"
How does it end?
Tragically.
Oh!
"Hello, Paul's phone."
"No, I'm sorry, he can't get to the phone right now."
There's a meeting I go to... over at the Calvary Church.
- What?
- It starts at 8:
OO.
All right.
Hey.
"Oh, Burton, you caught me."
"Oh, no, that's all right."
"Shannon was upstairs, so I snuck a butt."
"Oh, OK."
- You got another one?
"- Yeah, sure."
"Hey, Burton."
"Oh, honey, listen... one of my clients has a problem, so tonight might be a little tricky."
"I'm going to be there,"
- but just maybe a few minutes late.
- Oh.
"Now, the good news is Nick is going to be able to drive you over there."
- Nick?
- Yeah.
He's going to be your escort until I get there.
"You're going to have fun all the way around, OK?"
- Yeah.
- All righty.
See you soon.
Bye.
You wanted to see me?
Yeah.
Some bad news about Aaronson's wife.
- What happened?
- There was an accident.
What did he do to her?
I'll beat you up!
Watch the teapot!
I don't need your advice!
I'm telling you
You...
"Get off, right?"
"Okay, I'll take your word"
Why are you pulling my clothes?
"Gao, are you really leaving?"
Y es!
But bear this in mind
"It's me who fired you, not vice versa!"
"Oh, you asshole!"
"Hi, is there some gold here on the road?"
It's you again!
Stay calm!
I just want to ask you something
Mind your head!
"Oh, you two are killing each other?"
Who exactly is your Brother Y an?
Y an Qingwang!
How come he stayed with Thunderstorm?
Say!
"Y es, yes!"
I'll tell you!
Brother Jin is killed!
"Y es, after Y an Qingwang killed Jin Tianyun"
He stayed at Thunderstorm's house
Dad!
"2nd Brother, 2nd Brother!"
"2nd Brother, don't you know me?"
I'm the one that's always bullied by you
"Good Lord, what are you doing?"
"Nibet, you still have a lot to learn."
- Excuse me.
- Sir?
- The Number 10?
- To your right.
- Thank you.
- It's nothing.
Elizabeth?
Elizabeth?
Why am I in the garden?
Someone tried to suffocate you with the gas from the kitchen.
But the gas has been cut for two days.
You have not seen the men at work?
I have.
You escaped the worst.
How are you?
I do not know.
I feel drunk.
You have to walk.
Stand up.
Come on.
Breathe deeply.
Go ahead.
I remember.
- They gave me an injection.
- An injection?
Same as your brother: a soporific.
The man who pushed the needle was dressed in black.
Fantômas...
Fantômas?
"Ah, yes, the list."
I know.
But that doesn't mean you didn't.
Justin.
I get the feeling you're not here to see me.
"No, I'm not."
Is Rebecca here?
"Rebecca, this is Justin."
Justin Walker.
So you're one of them?
- His family?
- Yeah.
"- I got it, Mom."
- OK.
"If you're expecting tears from me, you can forget it."
I'm not expecting anything.
I just wanted to meet you.
"Well, I'm here."
I'm real.
You can even touch me.
- Uh... you want to walk?
- OK.
It's so bizarre.
"We live, like, 15 minutes away."
"In L.A., that's practically like being neighbors."
- Where did you go to school?
- I started at La Salle.
Swanky.
I got kicked out junior year and I finished up at San Marino.
- What about you?
- Marshall.
I think we played you in football.
- I didn't play football.
Everyone okay?
SAM:
Dirk.
[GUN CLICKS]
Winchester.
"What are you gonna do, shoot me?"
Don't need to.
"That rope is soaked in salt water, Dirk."
You're not going anywhere.
Everybody stay where you are.
You'll be okay.
Aren't you the P.E. teacher?
Not really.
I'm like 21 Jump Street.
[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
The bus driver sells pot.
Yeah.
It's not here!
-Where is it?
-No way you'll ever find it.
SAM:
Where is it?
"Sam Winchester, still a bully."
"You, you jocks."
"You popular kids, you always thought you were better than everybody else."
"And to you, I was just Dirk the Jerk, right?"
Now you evil sons of bitches are gonna get what's coming to you.
"I'm not evil, Dirk."
I'm not.
And neither were you.
Trust me.
I've seen real evil.
- That's right.
"- Two women, side by side..."
That is the most powerful thing that there is.
Now get on up here and attack each other.
- All right.
- What's that now?
What...
"Oh, God."
"Well, Cookie, hold on one second."
"This is my first class, so I don't think..."
Don't worry about it.
You're gonna be the attacker.
- Okay.
"- And Maggie, you just do all the moves that we've been working on, okay?"
"Yes, Cookie."
"All right, you're at the ATM."
It's late at night.
"Emma, attack."
"Beep, boop, beep, boop."
"Ooga-booga, give me your money and also your body!"
[groaning]
- You're dead.
- Ow.
"- Nice, Maggie."
- That actually really hurt.
"Remember too, your forearm is a five-way weapon, okay?"
- Five ways?
"- So you've got one,"
"- two, three, four, and five."
"- Ah, ah!"
- That hurts.
- You're okay.
"- Are you still in the same house, John?"
- You too?
"- Rachel, how?"
- I say hello.
A little girl was abducted.
I need to find him.
"""Sacred Quest"" A little girl's life, how beautiful."
Time is running out for him.
"I can feel it, John."
But time is running out for all of us.
Except you.
"You're dead, man."
"""Sticks"" have the name of a club."
"The club's owner, Jade the name of a woman."
"But the man behind the name ""Rook."" Jade, Rook'un knows where it is."
"- Girl, Rook'un hands?"
- Ask him.
"The Rook, a young man."
Young and very dangerous.
"Be careful, my friend."
"- The same as you say: ""I'm already dead."""
- Hey!
Bitch where is it?
!
(This is work that man.) (What's he doing that here?
)
"Fuck, man!"
Kill him!
Shut up.
- Rook'u Where can I find?
- I do not know what you're talking about halttan.
Fuck man!
"Fine, but Mr. Lloyd is not coming with us."
Period.
What do we do with the Atomium?
"I'm sorry, but do you have to do it right now?"
"Yes, it's very itchy."
Almost done.
I wonder how he feels.
He is probably in shock.
Wallonia broke off Belgium.
You can imagine his distress.
- Three papas.
- Shut up.
But it's true.
Kebab accident.
Border!
What the hell are you doing?
!
"Cheers, my friends!"
"The old generation, they want traditions, and we want fusion."
Coming!
- Hi!
- How are you?
"Hello, my dear."
Who are these people?
Who are all these guests?
"Mother, they are from Belgium."
They have to get to Sofia.
"They need a bus, can you imagine?"
A bus?
Here?
- Or a taxi.
- There are no taxis here.
BRENDAN FLYNT:
"Right, right, OK."
INTERVIEWER:
And that way it's cheaper to set on fire
A non-established character.
I don't think it matters.
I think it was more like that was on his resume.
"And they went, oh, there's an idea."
So now he starts right here.
MAN:
Where are your cameras?
He'll do the whole stunt.
I get most of the flame.
You'll still get your stuff here.
Is that OK?
So I'm gonna have both cameras at the bottom.
MAN:
So both the cameras--
BRENDAN FLYNT:
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Put my cameras down here.
MAN:
Yeah that' my buddy TJ up there.
I'm a little nervous just for him.
INTERVIEWER:
You're worried for him?
"Hey, how long have you been doing this?"
About 22 years.
"Setting myself on fire, probably about 10."
INTERVIEWER:
Yeah?
You nervous at all?
"ABC, NBC, CNN."
Mike.
That Canada story... still interest you?
Everything interests me.
"Uh, I quit, Mike."
Bullshit.
Come on.
It all worked out.
I did?
What do I tell a source on the next tough story?
No.
What got broken here...
"So, uh..."

THE wind will CARRY US
A film by Abbas KlAROSTAMl
Where's the tunnel then?
We've passed it.
When?
Someone's been sleeping!
Where is it?
"We've passed it, back near Biston."
We're heading nowhere.
Read the address to see where it is.
How many times do I have to read it?
"After the junction, we take a winding road."
This is the winding road.
We're on it.
"After this road, we head downhill."
Then there's a single tree.
- The fee.
For companionship.
Right.
This is all I have.
Hopefully that's enough.
We can stop by a cash machine.
"So this is what a day at the office is like, huh?"
Just another typical Tuesday.
Neil... and Grace.
Is it date night tonight?
How adorable you both look.
- I'm impressed.
- That's because it's authentic.
Everything in the spirit of the time period.
"Except tonight, the women are in charge."
Explore.
Make new friends.
Enjoy.
- Drink?
- Absolutely.
Two vodka martinis.
Up.
Olives.
- Have we met?
- No.
You look so familiar.
Yes.
So do you.
- Grace.
"- Oh, Audrey."
"Oh, now I get it."
You cancelled me so that you could do him yourself.
"Crazy, this."
"One red one you eat, another you don't."
"Look, there's a fine one."
I don't like that one at all...
You silly thing.
Please...
Where are the others?
Where are they all?
- Where are the others?
- There aren't any others.
- What about Henry?
- He's... back there.
"Elisa, someone's looking for you!"
When my pal was dying in the battlefield he asked me to bring you this.
"Elisa, my child..."
Pull yourself together.
"Oh God, what now."
"I've left my message, so goodbye."
Elisa.
Look at me.
Daddy.
Your Grace.
"A great performance, Jean!"
"- Yes, you'll get a medal."
"- Thank you, your Grace..."
A medal?
!
I've got 'dozens of those!
"Goodness, what happened?"
Henry was killed.
I'm so sorry.
That's life for you... that's life...
Honey?
This reminds me of the time in college when we drove to Fort lauderdale in my Austin HeaIy.
I haven`t thought about that for a Iong time.
Remember what we did in the car?
It`s amazing we didn`t get in an accident.
Want to relive a fond memory?
Are you serious?
No!
Why not?
"Because, that`s why."
The kids are asleep.
Let`s just wait `tiII we get to a motel.
"Okay, we`II wait."
I`II find the best one on the road.
Do you want to put your head in my lap?
That`s not what I was thinking.
The wheel.
"There you go, out of your way."
Comfy?
clark?
My head`s stuck.
Quit kidding around!
It hurts!
It`s stuck.
Cut it out!
"I know what you`re trying to do, and I think it`s sick!"
The wheeI`s stuck!
That was a dirty trick!
The damn wheel is all screwed up.
You`re tired.
You get weird when you get tired.
Let`s just find a motel.
-You think so?
-Babe...
-...
I know so.
-Good.
I love a man who speaks his mind even when it's bullshit.
"Hey, stranger."
"-Hey, you."
-Hey.
What time did you come to bed?
-I tried to wake you.
-Really?
-You didn't move.
-I didn't even feel it.
How did it go yesterday?
-With the apartments.
-Good.
What's the status?
I saw a few things.
Most of them were pretty disgusting.
Yeah.
I think it's gonna take some time.
"I was sure there was something perfect in here, just ready to rent."
So how was work yesterday?
Strange.
"I had to deal with a 16-year-old having an Ecstasy-induced psychotic episode, and he thought I was a Nazi."
How ironic.
-Yeah.
-And upsetting.
"Yeah, he was pretty upset."
-I'm sure.
-This one looks good.
"-I don't like the C note, Rosato."
I take that as an insult.
Michael Corleone says hello!
Close the door!
Your friend the cop...
"Hey, Ritch."
It's dark in here.
Are you open or closed?
"I just came in to clean up a little, you know?"
What's the matter?
-Is that something on the floor?
"-Carmine, not here!"
Anthony!
You open this bar and I'll blow your head in!
"Freddy, it's good to see you."
-How is he?
-He's okay.
He's in the back.
"Girls, take a hike."
In this room here.
-I want to talk to him alone first.
-Come on.
"I thought I could help you, Senator."
Hagen?
"-Listen, I did not..."
-It's all right.
-I didn't do anything.
-It's okay.
You're very lucky.
My brother Fredo operates this place.
He was called before anyone.
"Had this happened some place else, we couldn't have helped you."
Is it still a long way?
Wait for me!
Wait for me!
I can't go so fast
It hasn't changed
"Hey, wait, slow down, I have to pee"
One for all and all for one
Let's stop here
"With a horse, at least nobody has to pedal"
It's dirty
You're never happy
"Look, it's Charles"
A breakdown?
You can't get anywhere
"- Okay, you win."
Come on.
"- Oh, thank you"
Take care of my bike
"Hey, what're you doing?"
- lm looking for something.
- What?
Would it be a Swiss knife?
"Yeah, I suppose"
How come you've got it?
"In a way, I did a trade"
For what?
A secret
What?
It's about Charles.
You can tell he's in love
You sure?
He's sticking his lips out
"-Goodbye, Amadeo."
-To you I do not salute to you.
He is amiable...
The cut practiced and the blood has been horrible.
I say to you that it is not possible...
"Boys, you watch."
"Is not the dandy, that of there?"
The dandy?
It seems a closet.
That enormous one?
He comes towards here.
"But, who is?"
We hope that he does not see us.
I already am in charge to flee.
Calm and caradura.
"No, calm and swollen face?"
you do not see as it is?
"Hello, Paulino."
Dr. Sughirini...
Ceggirini...?
-Dr.
Cichhirini?
-Yes.
He is there.
He is.
He is.
With permission.
"When they act thus, it would give a beating them."
It remembers that today we must go to gather the new car...
-Dr.
Cicchirini?
-Yes?
SlPOWlCZ:
What's up?
- Guy in a wheelchair.
- He's got a gun on four hostages.
- I know this guy.
Let me talk to him.
- Wait for the negotiating team.
- You sure the guy's going to wait?
SERGEANT:
Get him a vest.
OFFICER:
Got it.
Ernie Dowd!
It's Detective Sipowicz!
"- I'm coming in, Ernie!"
ERNIE:
I got no beef with you.
"We'll be done in here in a while, then everyone can come in."
You got no problem with the bartender.
Why don't you let the bartender out?
"Yeah, go ahead."
- Put this on my tab.
BARTENDER:
Sure.
SlPOWlCZ:
Come on.
"I'm coming in, Ernie."
"You were over there, weren't you?"
"Couple inches the other way, I'd be just like you."
"You gotta cut this out, man."
They got guns out there.
They don't know these three are assholes.
- I know.
And your leopard pants.
- Too much fun.
Too much fun.
- And my shorts.
Totally.
- They're so nice.
"- Mom, can we just please go home?"
- You are no fun.
This is why you're the designated driver.
You're the responsible one.
"That's funny, honey."
That's really funny.
- Unlike us.
You are so not responsible.
- I'm responsible sometimes.
Where are you girls gonna go to school?
"Where are you gonna apply to college, huh?"
- CalArts.
Yeah.
- Ohh.
- Great.
- UCSB.
- Yeah.
- You see?
"Both of them, local."
"Oh, my God."
"This one, she wants to apply someplace like the University of Lithuania."
Ha-ha-ha!
I don't even know where I want to apply yet.
- Lithuania.
"- I mean, it's like the East Coast, right?"
"Paolo took me to a residence,... where the practice was to swap partners."
"-Yes, who is it?"
-Roberto.
Oscar sent me.
"Well, we have arrived."
-Are you coming in?
-One moment.
-Good evening and welcome friends.
-Good evening.
Have you got something for the cloakroom?
Perhaps you don't need your handbag.
Do you know the local?
"No, but others of the same style."
"The ones that pay for drinks, will know."
They'll see.
Let's go.
What would you like?
-What would you like to drink dear?
-Nothing.
"To watch, we must consume something."
-A whisky on the rocks.
-One with Coca-Cola. for me.
-Here you are.
-Thanks.
Here we go.
Have another?
-How much is it?
"-100,000."
-Thanks.
-Thanking you.
Take it.
"Come, we find someplace to sit."
"-Fredo, this is Johnny Ola."
-We need some more help.
-Johnny?
"Jesus Christ, what the hell time is it?"
"-Who's that, honey?"
"-Listen good, Fredo."
Why are you calling me?
I don't want to talk to you.
Pentangeli is going to accept the Rosato brothers' deal.
"-Oh, God."
-Will he come alone?
I don't know.
You've got me in deep enough already.
Everything will be all right.
Pentangeli says he's willing to make a deal.
"All we want to know is if he's on the level, or if he'll bring his boys."
You lied to me.
I don't want you to call me anymore.
-Your brother won't find out we talked.
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Who was that?
-Wrong number.
"-Frankie, I've got nobody here."
"-Wait in the car, Cicc'."
-Frankie.
"-That's okay, Cicc'."
-What's this?
-A lucky C note for our new deal.
Ritchie.
Give us a taste.
"We were all real happy about your decision, Frankie."
-You won't regret it.
Look son.
You should be careful in such situations.
Otherwise you will stumble.
Who stumbled?
No... no one.
I was just saying he should be careful in life... otherwise one stumbles.
Yes.
That's a good advice.
Right.
And son.
You know whom we're sending you to in Delhi.
Your uncle sub-inspector Zoravar.
Yes.
He'll take good care of you.
And I've heard he's no ordinary man.
The whole of Delhi's afraid of him.
I've heard that people fear him... more than 'Chulbul Pandey' and 'Singham'.
Zoravar's so feared... that he always catches the goons he's after.
Help.
Police.
Help.
Police.
Help.
Don't beat me.
Don't beat me.
Beat him.
Uncle.
I never imagined...
I'd come to Delhi and see you in this condition.
- How did this happen?
- Nephew.
They were 20 and I was alone.
3rd: the Atom at 1.24.
2nd: the Westfield at 1.23.02.
And first - the amazing Radical at 1.19.08.
"Right, diesel engines."
Three makers didn't do diesel engines.
Honda - they've done it.
Saab - they did it.
"Now, the last one has now gone."
Jaguar.
No!
It's terrible.
JEREMY MIMICS A JAGUAR ENGINE
Are you OK?
That's nasty.
It's horrific news.
"They're doing a V6 in the S-type, and a four cylinder in the X-type."
Which has nothing to do with Ford.
"It won't be a Ford engine, it's a Jaguar engine in every way!"
Yep.
"But if you pick at ""Jaguar"", it might say "".. ord"" underneath."
I have worries about this.
"Jaguar is stealthy, sleek..."
Is it going to work?
Have a look - we have one here.
We'll see if it works.
Stig.
Yeah.
ENGINE RATTLES
Oh dear.
LAUGHTER
That simply won't work.
"It loses something, doesn't it?"
Roger and out.
"Savoy 6, this is Bulldog."
"Go ahead, Bulldog."
We have the Mike Force in position.
Let us know when you're ready.
"Roger, Bulldog."
Savoy 6.
We'll use the air strike to keep Charlie's head down.
Execute plan 3 in 2 minutes.
Do you roger?
Roger.
Out.
"Two minutes, pass the word."
SOLDIER:
"Fall back, damn it!"
Fall back to the commo bunker!
Everybody!
MacDANIEL:
Let go with the phoogas!
SOLDIER:
Let's go!
Keep down.
Take a platoon down and reinforce Evans.
I'm going to the tower.
KIRBY:
What's the situation?
We can't even hold this place with that air strike.
KIRBY:
Provo!
Dig that .30 in and give support to the .50 caliber.
PROVO:
"Give me that, I can handle it."
"I can't say the same for the shooter, we'll get him good."
Who?
The dealer?
"No, apparently he's not the shooter."
We'll know more after the questioning.
We put him in a hotel on rue Marcadet.
The Eldorado?
"No, the Étoile d'Agadir."
Why?
Are you interested in the case?
"You're talking, I'm listening."
"Hello, Judicial Police."
Nadia speaking.
"Nadia, it's Gilou."
Can you check a licence plate?
"Go ahead, I'm listening."
"Alpha Charlie 073, India Kilo 75."
"Hold on, I'm checking."
Why are you asking?
It belongs to the Crime Squad.
"OK, thank you."
Hello?
"Hi, it's Dylan."
"I went to the home,"
I met my new youth workers.
Can I stop by to tell you about it?
"It's not easy at the moment, Dylan."
I'm with a client.
Can we talk later?
- Are you gonna be long?
"I don't know, I'll call you back."
Bastard.
This will be a piece of cake.
Father!
Father!

Her name was Constance Cabrizzi.
I used to call her Connie.

- I took her to the prom.
Amazing coincidence...
me knowing all these girls.
You knew about the nurse.
Now you know about Cheryl.
And now Connie.
- You've got to tell someone.
- Who?
Who can I trust?
I don't know how high up this goes.
- What do you mean?
- Say I told the wrong person.
- You didn't do this.

ls it an obvious frame?
"Jack, grab this chair."
We'll meet you downstairs.

You feel like talking?
"I can't remember most of it, being over there."
I don't want to remember it either.
SlPOWlCZ:
Good luck.
James.
"Counselor, can I have a word with you in private?"
I want us to be square about that fish.
"Andy, I don't think we're going to make it."
Out of my sight!
Sorry I'm late.
It's okay.
Are you done?
Against the wall!
I've to search you!
Don't go too far!
Why?
I suspect you're an illegal immigrant!
You're Lisa's boyfriend?
"I meant ex-boyfriend, Michael?"
Michael!
You've suspended?
Why are you here?
Let go!
Do I need to escort you out personally?
"How are you, David?"
"Mr. Lin, welcome back."
"Just give me the keys, I'll follow."
Thanks.
"Anything else you need, Mr. Lin?"
You're great.
No wonder my brother praised you.
Thanks.
Goodbye.
"Lisa, is there a Lo Keung amongst my brother's friends?"
"No, why do you ask?"
Just wondering.
You suspect a friend killed him?
It doesn't seem like a robbery.
I'm not convinced.
My brother values his life.
"- Okay, 42."
Got it.
Two days ago.
That'd be the night Johnny was to call me.
Maybe he--?
"I was getting desperate, but it might be a lead."
There was one place in town where l could find out for sure.
Evening.

- Somebody special?
Missing Persons thought I ought to look.
- Who's missing?
- What's it to you?
- Homicide Squad.
- Lieutenant Kincaid.
- l thought you was a morgue buff.
- Buff?
A nut like those guys that chase fires.
I didn't know Homicide men hung out in the morgue.
- Where you f rom?
- Out of town.
- Frisco.
- How did you know?
The accent. I can spot any accent.
What's the name?
Charlie Wilson.
Met him on the train.
I thought I talked him out of suicide.
He didn't show f or dinner.
No word since.
- Yeah?
I meant your name.

"Uh, no."
[ Clears throat ]

"""Unforgiven,"" and then I was too jacked to sleep, so...research."
Sam:
Gadreel?
And Metatron and the mark of Cain and...
Crickets.
"I did find us a case, though."
"Oh, yeah?"
"Yeah, was a strange death in Stillwater, Minnesota."
A competitive eater died after a hot dog-eating contest.
"So, what?"
Death by tube steak?
If only.
Dean:
"He got attacked in his car, but, uh, get this -- he shrunk from 300 pounds to 90 pounds."
Witchcraft?
Or a heavy-duty laxative.
You game?
Yeah.
Good.
Looks like it's a whore's bath for me.
I'll be ready in five.
"You sure you're okay, Dean?"
Why wouldn't I be?
'Cause -- I don't know you...
"This isn't about what I said the other day, is it?"
Da Ran...
It's me.
Yoon Jae...
I...
"I was so very, very worried!"
I felt like this all happened because I got angry and threw a fit...
I was so very worried because I thought it was all my fault!
Because I...
Because I needlessly said those words...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry too.
The words I was going to say to you...
I'll say them now.
Ppuing-ppuing.
"I'm sorry, ppuing-ppuing!"
He's not coming back.
"I'm saying, he didn't come back."
I'm Kang Gyung Joon!
Your face looks very disappointed.
Hello?
Teacher Gil.
Get your senses back.
Where are we right now?
Does this...
All seem like a child's joke to you right now?
Is it fun?
Why is an adult crying at a child's joke?
Being fooled by a kid like you...
I'm the one at fault.
Is it my fault that we didn't switch back?
Why is she getting mad at me?
Where are my belongings?
"And if we're going to survive it, we can't turn on each other."
We're all we have.
I know.
I'll never do anything like that again.
Do you think you can ever forgive me?
"Yeah, I forgive you."
(engine starting)
(tires squealing)
"== sync, corrected by elderman =="
(crying)
We broke up.

Can I trust you to pass this on?

"Sorry, are you married?"
I live alone.
Oh.

"Do you ever go in the loft, Mr Moss?"
I rarely venture beyond the ground floor.

"You shouldn't really be here, Len, You know that, right?"
You're retired.
Argh!

Sorry.
- What did I do?
- That's my place.
This has been my mug since I was a kid.
"So much, there's no need,"
"I always have tea, and maybe one slice of toast."
"You have to eat, or she'II be offended."
Eat up.
"Have some sausages, the zabaglione's forme."
She makes it forme every morning with fresh eggs.
- It's dynamite!
- I can imagine.
Eat something.
- Just to...
- Don't you Iike it?
Yeah.
"I was very, very hurt."
I'm kidding.
"Brown, take the brown ones."
Don't take the white ones or the
Red ones.
Why brown?
Because brown is the
Ibuprofen.
The red and the white ones are
Left over from when I was
Seriously addicted to pills.
"Well, why didn't you just"
Throw them away?
Because I'm sentimental.
About pills?
Sarcasm.
"All right, so, uh, the red,"
Right?
Brown.
Brown.
Gonna take the brown.
Tell me he's not color blind.
I hope not.
Are you sure there's not
Anything I can do?

Yan-ling!
We came here today to catch the traitor Chao Fung.
We've no quarrel with anyone else.

Hello.
Is it Lusty Terhi?
Wait...
I'd just fallen asleep.
"Okay, try to come fast."
"I'm trying, Terhi."
I'm the secret garden of your lusts.
I'm taking off my panties now.
My orchid is opening up.
"Where are you going at this hour, Jemina?"
Where were we?
You said Jemina.
-So?
"Terhi, let's pretend that my name is Jesse."
I don't believe it.
Remember Pepita the Elephant?
Give me some phone sex now.
"Do I have to, Jesse?"
I'm fucking paying for this.

To repay society for his sins...
To emerge from his world of darkness...
From his endless forever night.
Thanks for your help.
I appreciate it.
"Your name, please?"

"I'm--l'm really sorry, honey."

She doesn't belong there.
"I mean, it's for retarded people."
She doesn't belong in that place.

He lost touch with her.

"He thought it would inspire the guys to try a little bit harder but the other team's coach saw it, protested, and had him kicked off the team and they lost without him."
"So, maybe his name is not on a plaque."
"(KNOCKING ON DOOR) Oh, excuse me,"
"I have friends dropping over, too."
"Hi, Amy."

"Really emphasize the ""now."" You're mad with this guy."
"Right here and now, boy."
Now shove him.
Physically.
That's not necessary.
"Very thoughtful, but, uh, you know, up yours."
'Cause 2 Wycked don't need no wash right now.
I just hit it with a Chamois.
She's gleaming like the freakin' sun.
Drop the load!

Brain:
"Meatwad, report to Brain Quarters."

"Better be free, little meat man."
That's the way out.
"Now you're here, and she's going to to deal with it."
"I must implement corporate review, but it ends here."
-Everything okay?
I think I took from the car.
It goes well.
How are you doing?

"The Chinese investor, it's him."
Aksel Nilsen.

"Helen, now comes the Chinese soon."
It does not appear here.
Tonje.

It's not what's important now.
Now you just go in and smile and buttoning his coat outright.
Let me.
It is not here.

You and I. Right?
So remember to smile.
We have made major investments in buildings and machinery.
-per-Olav?
"-Blitt Big shot now, yes."
Ha ha.
"Touché, Eddie."
"Come on, let's go and pay for the stuff."
I've remembered why we shouldn't be here.
- We have no cash.
"- Eddie, I am a celebrity."
Celebrities don't need money.
- Next.
- Ha ha ha.
Boo!
"Hello, love."
"It's me, Richie Rich."
A-ha!
It's just cancer crunch and a trolley of meat.
I'll give you a mensh on my next prog.
"£200, please."
"My dear girl, you don't seem to understand."
"I, Richie Rich, am offering you, nobody, a mensh on my next prog."
- Right.
This requires subtle handling.
"- £200, please."
How does it feel to be a checkout girl who's reached the peak of your potential?
How does it feel to know that you're a talentless git who never even had any potential?
- I see.
"- £200, please."
Uh.
Stitch that.
I think you're on there.
I know a come-on when I see it.
This is ridiculous.
Somebody here tell donkey face who I am.
We don't know.
It must be at least 18 years now.
"We drive up to Germany, up to the Fuhrer's headquarters."
"To Berchtesgaden, and then to the Eagle's Nest."
Because it interests me.
A couple of times now they've questioned me.
The police.
"The Gestapo, or whatever."
It's not called the Gestapo anymore.
I'm on their list.
My name shows up.
They look in their computer:
"""Ochs, Josef."
Marz...
"Holy Christ!"""
It means you have quite a record.
My sweet little mouse.
"Sophia, Sophia."
My darling.
Your cheeks are all red.
Are you warm?
We'll take your bonnet off.
"Look, where are we?"
"Look, in Daddy's basement."
Look!
At night he's down here at the computer.
He works all night.
"Look, my little mouse."
Look at all the paper he needs.
"That doesn't interest you, sure."
"It's fun, you can watch TV."
"Look, sweetie."
You can see yourself in the TV.

- Probably forgot his ration book.
"Now remember, Billy, you've just to point him out to me."

"Has the army changed its uniforms, Billy?"
What's the plan?
Where's the trap?
Glasgow.
They're waiting for you at Glasgow.
"So they finally let you in the army, did they, Billy?"
Congratulations.
"Oh, my God!"
Thank you.
You've been terribly kind.
You won't change your mind and have a spot of lunch?
"When I worked there last summer,"
I spent every day jumping JCBs over cement mixers.
"- Well, that's a lie."
- And I got paid a grand at the end.
- Another lie!
- I had a wank earlier
- about your mum's tits.
Is that alle?

- What d'you say?
- What?
"- He's taking the piss, Danny."
- Yeah?
I'll fucking do you.
"- Yeah, whatever."
- Wanker.
- What's his problem?
"- Ooh, don't cry, Simon!"
"Yeah, good one."
"Um, catch up in a bit."
"Oh, that's right, run after her, that's not creepy!"
"I may not have received any Valentine's cards, but that didn't mean I hadn't sent any."
Charlotte!
"Oh, hello."
Happy Valentine's day.
Did you get any cards?
- You don't want what he's having.
"- Just pour it, Tony."
"- Come on, Tony."
Come on.
"- Okay, okay."
I thought you were turning over a new leaf.
"Yeah, I nearly died today, Rabbit."
And you saved my life.
"I guess, um... we're even."
Is that you want to be?
Even?
All accounts closed.
Everything tied up.
Nothing complicated.
I...
I... don't know.
"Yeah, neither do I."
Thank you.
Tony.
Previously on rescue me...
What if you never see him again?
And I also started drinking again.
But let me explain.
- And that is so stupid.
- It's--it's not stupid.
I got--I figured it out.
I have a system.I can control it.
Hook a brother up with a long island iced tea.
- Who's gonna know?
- I will.
"Besides, I told your mom I'm watching out for you."
I'll see you later.
"Okay, bye."
- Bye.
- You make me sick.
- I had no choice.
- You're a disgusting excuse for a man!
- What was I supposed to do?
- You're the one I wanna be...
- Don't touch me!
You will never touch me again.
"Dino, thanks again for letting me pay over the phone."
I assure you this late-payment thing will never happen again.
"Yep, just trying to trim some of the drama out of my life."
[BEEPING]
"Oh, that's my other line."
"Okay, bye."
- Hello?
BILL:
"Hi, Gigi?"
This is Bill.
- Bill?
- Alex's friend.
We were supposed to meet up but Alex told me the wrong day.
"Bill, so you do exist."
I do.
And I'd love to buy you dinner sometime if you're still game.
Yes.
"Sure, why not?"
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Hey.
"Coming, I'm coming, I'm coming."
Hi.
- Life changed.
It got...
- Boring?
It doesn't need to be.
Come on.
"Oh, my God..."
"You know Candace, in catering?"
- My first wife.
- I didn't know that.
Yeah.
Candy Kanaskie.
No wonder she left me.
Omelettes.
"Sure, a bachelor's standby."
"Oh, I'm married."
"Oh yeah, you said first wife."
I assumed that meant there was a second.
And third.
I was talking about me.
Omelettes are my standby.
Sausage?
Kielbasa!
"So what, after the lawyer who went gay, you figure, what, one then done?"
"Well, the job, the kids, it got hard to find a serious..."
- No cheese?
- No.
"No, no, no."
"So it's not a classic, then."
Kanaskie classic.
"Yeah, my exes, they blamed the job too."
"No kids, though, unless you count the ones I supervise here."
"It's a lot, but they just didn't understand what it takes."
"- Ow, ow, ow, ow."

I want to get a look at that sexy hot rod.
"You know, I used to be a purty good whistler."
"I can't do it now, of course, on account of sometimes"
"I get fluid built up in my engine block, but Doc said he's gonna fix it."
He can fix about anything.
That's why we made him the judge.
"Boy, you shoulda heard me on Giddy-up, Oom Papa Mow Mow."
"Now, I'm not one to brag but people come purty far to see me get low on the ""Mow-Mow""."
Oh!
"- Aw, man, that's just great!"
"- Hey, what's wrong?"
My lucky sticker's all dirty.
"Ah, that ain't nothin'."
I'll clean it for ya.
"No, no, no!"
That won't be necessary.
Hey!
"Hey, big fella!"
"Yeah, you in the red!"
I could use a little hose down.
Help me wash this off.
Where's he goin'?

Strictly small potatoes.
"You sure can pick 'em, Doyle."
Still wearing your gun on your ankle?
"Someone told me the reason why you do that is... ..when you meet a chick and you rub up against her,... ..she can't tell you're a cop."
I said it's bullshit.
It's gotta be a fast-draw gimmick or somethin'.
"Bill, why don't you knock it off, huh?"
He's gettin' too far ahead.
You're gonna lose him.
"For Christ's sake, move the car!"
What the hell is goin' on here?
"Klein, this is Cloudy."
Do you read me?
"Klein, this is Cloudy."
Do you read me?
!
"Come in, for Christ's sakes!"
This is Cloudy.
Talked to your husband about going overseas?
"Yes, I've been talking to him."
"Yes, I know."
"You've been a perfect angel about it, but I've changed my mind."
You have?
I think that Robert should go.
Are you sure Bob wants to?
"All right, Gretchen,"
I'll tell my husband that Bob's changed his mind.
"Oh, thank you, Karen."
You're such a darling!
I'll tell him he should have his orders in the next 24 hours.
"Goodbye, Gretchen."

GIRL:
"Oh, dear!"
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)
What are you doing?
I'm leavin'.
I have to get out of here.
"Listen, if I leave my suitcase, will you send it to me?"
I guess so.
You're just gonna sneak out of here without saying goodbye to anyone?
"Well, I have to."
"You say goodbye to Nancy for me, huh?"
What do you want me to tell her?
"Tell her, uh..."
"Just tell her goodbye, huh?"
You!
Help!
Quiet or I'll kill you right here.
Contract money?
Hey moron come here.
Yes Boss.
That's it.
I've the advance money.
Fine.
Brothers will pay for their sister's betterment.
Fool.
No.
Tauji.
He's getting Shiv married to Ankita instead of killing him.
Why don't you say something?
The Boss has taken up anew contract.
The rules say... you may sacrifice akin.
But never miss a contract.
And anyway this is about blood-ties and not contract.
Because Shiv is my brother.
I'll say it three times.
He's my brother...
my brother... my brother.
Ayushman.
Remember.
The Boss' blood boils.
And when it does he spares no one.
You were right Ayushman.
We should've burnt him.
We should've buried him.
Go on.
Go...
Didn't you hear?
Shiv is the Boss' brother.
Brother.
She was having so much fun with that little girl.
"And then i saw the father, and he was flying a kite with his son."
They were having fun.
And there was a couple...
A couple about my age...
And they were
"On a blanket in the middle of the park,"
"Just laughing, enjoying each other."
And i thought about the fact
That i have never been on a blanket...
- Oh.
- ...with marcus.
- Oh.
"- I think i just passed so many opportunities, ma."
I...
I haven't been a good mother.
- I haven't been a good wife.
- Oh.
Oh.
"I want those chances back,"
And i think it's too late.
I never sat on a blanket and had a picnic.
"Oh, regina."
I never had fun with my child.
I never...
I never pushed monica on a swing.
- Oh.
"- Mom, i wanna change my life."
- Oh.
"- I'm so sorry, mama."
"It's all right, baby."
It's all right.
Go!
"I'm being removed from my own helicopter, ladies and gentlemen."
The first margarita's on me.
Not so fast.
Did you get it?
Did you?
Yes!
I want big!
I want cinematic!
I want...
I want Pennebaker.!
Get this.
Get the copter.
You smell that?
Do you smell that?
"Nothing else in the world smells like that, son."
I love the smell of napalm in the morning.
You know one day we had a hill bombed.
"When I walked out, we didn't find one of them."
Not one stinking dink body.
But that smell.
That gasoline smell.
The whole hill.
It smelled like... victory.

Why were you kissing him?
"Um, because I'm, um..."
I'm sort of dating him.
You're dating your ex-husband's girlfriend's father?
Yeah.
That's right.
"Well, you know, Christine, if we don't tell you enough, we are so happy you're at this school."
That's nice.
Ugh!
"I got so distracted by those meanie moms,"
"Yes, I'm fine."
"Well, I'll just visit the powder room."
Of course.
You sure Mrs McCarthy's in danger?
George may well have poisoned Henry to stop him revealing that he killed Vera Blanchett.
And if George did that to Henry...
Exactly.
"Oh, that looks lovely."
I've taken the liberty of pouring you some wine.
Oh!
Why not?
"Here's to you, Bridget, and to Henry."
Of course.
To poor Henry.
"Oh, It's quite sharp."
Maybe even a little bitter.
Try the fish.
Yes.
Mrs McCarthy.
What are you...
George.
What on earth is going on?
!
I'm afraid there has been a fire at St Mary's.
A fire!
"Now, the Fire Brigade have it under control, Mrs McCarthy, but I need you to go back with Sid and sort out a few things."
But I haven't even started my dinner.
I'm so sorry.

LUCY:

-What?
"Oh, my Pa's gonna insist on one."
And you know how mad he gets.
A wedding.
"Well, someone should buy a round of drinks."
"The Lord blesses the union of two lovers, glory to behold."
"No, no, this is nonsense, all right?"
It's nonsense.
I'm not the father of that baby.
I'm not the father of that baby.
I'm not about to get married.
"No, no."
[LUCY sobbing ]
"Well, Buck, it looks like it's time to get yourself a ring and a new suit."

Well?
"I've wired lawyers, courthouses."

I'm here to use my journalistic connections to get them out.

Darling.
You're alive!
All right.
"Olivia and Abby can catch up, but we've got to get you to the hospital to meet your son, mister."
When did you get a Porsche?
"Oh, it's my brother's."
He gave it to me when he met Antonio and moved to Florence.

It's surprising.
Okay.

The gun was not found.
But back to what we were talking about.
Christer calling you.
He said that a person would be killed.
But he does not talk you who is?
The Christer knew who it was?

You were covering Christer.
Why did not he tell them?
-No Was Lars who answered.
He called you often?
What does this have to do?
-Christer Was his brother. -how Do you know?

Forget?
What can he make me forget?
I have nothing but hate left for him.
"But I won't let him forget, I'll show him"
He's in for a shock when he sees what he's done to me.
Hold on for a minute!
What is it?
Get dressed and hurry away!
My brother-in-law.
Damn!
Is there nobody here?
"You're sleeping in broad daylight, right?"
"But not in my underwear, Karl!"
"Also, still cheeky!"
I drove through the night.

A lot.
So everything with Jacob was a mistake?
- No.
- What was it then?
"I was very in love with Jacob, but I was also very unhappy."
About what?
About being in love with him.
We just hurt each other all the time.
When you told me Jorgen wasn't my father   why didn't you say Jacob was?
Maybe because...
"Oh, no!"
"Oh, boy."
"Oh, oh..."
"Oh, boy, oh, boy!"
Ow.
"Hey, kiddies."
Got your juice.

Last juice of the day.
Great.
"Uh, cran-apple?"
Wait a minute.
Something's up.

"Well, my trachea constricts due to histamines that my body produces..."
"Okay, okay, Rudy, stop talking."
Why are your shoes muddy?
Because I'm-I'm poor.

"That if a hunter tasted his flesh,"
I could look at the spiritual world.
But I do not see any spiritual world.
"Maybe she was the only one, who had no soul."
Food for the creatures of God.

I come in peace.
How do we know you don't have another one of those in your sock?
You don't.
Speak.
Do not approach.
- Seen Katy around?
- No.
- That is all.
- (GROWLING) Stewart!
Trouble in paradise?
"If there was, she wouldn't know it."
I'm not talking to her.
Well played.
Wait it out.
That way she'll come to the conclusion that you're upset with her and ask you why.
- Precisely.
- She should anyway.
- If she's smart.
- I know.
- Why are you mad at her?
- She acts like...
You should try an open relationship.
Could be productive.
You could also try a hall pass.
"Whoever she is, she's not worth the bother."
I think David's mixed up in something.
That girl they found in the Kingsmead...
"Jack, it's me, Jane."
Just checking in on the latest on the Bentleys.
"Apparently, they're gonna rob a bank."
- There's something going out between those brothers.
We have movement at the Pembridge.
Do you know what kind of man Clifford Bentley is?
What's that for?
"You a superstitious man, Silas?"
He's losing his grip on this job.
"There's a matching necklace, part of a set."
My God.
"- Jane, there's something..."
- Yes?
I saw you both earlier.
You should speak to him.
If you're serious.
About what?
- Sarge?
- What the hell was that?
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Golf Hotel to all units.
I need a report.
Someone tell me what the hell's going on!
I want two of you on doors!
Look how happy the mom is now.
"-Oh, Rach."
-Screw you!
You don't have to do it!
-Hey.
-Hey!
-What's up?
-Mona just dumped me.
"Oh, man, I'm sorry."
Why?
"Lately, I haven't exactly been the perfect boyfriend."
I didn't tell her I got Rachel pregnant.
I gave her a key to my apartment and then had the locks changed.
Then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me.
"In a way, I judge her for not breaking up with me sooner."
That really sucks.
Especially on Valentine's Day.
Wait a minute.
What are you doing here?
Joey without a date on Valentine's Day?
"What's going on, huh?"
Girl trouble?
-Sort of.
-Really?
You don't have to seem so happy about it.
Maybe I can help.
"Whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me."
"You know, actually, once I got dumped during sex."
"-So anyway, what is it?"
-Forget about it.
It's no big deal.
"-Come on, what is it?"
-stella.
"Oh, stella for star!"
-blanche!
"Oh, my darling."
"Now, Iet me look at you."
"But don't you look at me, stella."
"No, no, no!"
-I won't be looked at in this merciless glare.
-Did you find our place?
What are you doing in a place like that?
"Never, never, never in my worst dreams did I picture--"
only Poe.
only Mr. Edgar allan Poe could do justice to it.
What are you doing in that horrible place?
"Oh, what am I saying?"
I didn't mean to say that.
"I meant to be nice and say, ""What a convenient location,"" and such."
-You haven't said a word to me.
-You haven't given me a chance to.
"-You dog, open your pretty mouth and talk."
-Come say hello to stanley first.
"-No, not now."
Not now.
-Just say hello.
"Oh, which is he?"
Which one is he?
-Is he the one that's--
-The one that's making all the rhubarb.
Isn't he wonderfuI-Iooking?
"stella, I can't meet him now."
Not till I've bathed and rested.
-would you Iike a cold drink?
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
Speak up!
Marie.
Marie?
- I found her.
I promised her not to tell you.
What're you saying?
This is Marie's tattoo.
Don't go.
Don't go there!
Shit!
Schrader.
Call out a large-scale search for H.K. Minks.
"Yes, Minks!"
Schrader.
What a shame.
But it had to end this way someday.
I didn't think anyone knewwhere she was.
Howthe heck did they find her?
You're not serious.
We just have to see your face.
We only need this here.
That's how Gunzel probably contacted lrezumi.
We' ll get him.
He can't pass this up.
"Maya, it's just a matter of time before you're discovered."
You don't understand a thing.
I'll keep my eye on you.
Nothing will happen to you.
You thought differently yesterday.
Damn it... yesterday!
"- No, I love it."
It's perfect.
- Good.
- One with everything on it.
"- Make that two, please."
"So, how's..."
- Luke?
- Yeah.
Okay.
- He went fishing.
- Fishing?
Yeah.
He didn't catch anything though.
- He probably used the wrong bait.
- Yeah.
That's a common fishing blunder.
So he's good?
"Yeah, he's good."
I can tell him hello for you if you want.
Whatever.
Thank you.
- My God.
This is really good.
- I'm glad you like it.
"- So, how much time you got?"
- I got a bit.
There's a record store you should check out.
It's run by this insane freak who's a walking encyclopedia... for every punk and garage band record ever made.
Catalog numbers.
He's crazy.
The place is right out of High Fidelity.
- Let's go.
- West Virginia?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Something's come up.
You're kidding.
Something of national interest in West Virginia?
"No, scientific."
I'll tell you about it later.
Cy's beginning to look rabid.
"Keep him at bay, okay?"
Are you okay?
You sounda little stressed.
"No, I'm fine."
I'll talk to you later.
We were parked up here... and sort a making out in the back seat.
And what happened next... is sort of hard to explain.
"Next day, I woke up and...both my... my eyes were swelled up."
What did the doctors say?
He couldn't explain it.
See this one here?
It ain't never healed.
We're getting engaged.
That's good.
"Yes, talk me?"
Talk me?
- I gotta talk to you.
- Okay.
Mr. Klein.
Hello.
I want to speak with you.
Ok.
Last night I woke up... with the worst headache
"I think I know how, but it's a little dangerous."
Like sandwiches with toothpicks in them dangerous?
Even more dangerous than that.
Like eating a bomb?
In between.
Like eating a firecracker.
Yeah.
Okay.
Here's what we're gonna do.
Well... aren't you kids playing nice.
"Hey, Ethan, over here."
Look at my face and hands while I'm talking.
I just want you to know it's my mom's birthday today.
"Um, it isn't June 3, it's today."
Okay.
"Wait, I have some questions for you."
Uh-huh.
"Um, what does ""Ethan"" mean?"
Um...
Sounds like how Shakespeare Huh?
"So, maybe that's where it comes from?"
Yeah.
I don't know.
Maybe.
"Next question, uh... if a train leaves New York at 4:00, and another train leaves Dallas at 5:00, what time will they meet?"
Uh...
Great.
"Well, I'm kind of busy right now, so I'm gonna have to let you go."
Have fun at my mom's birthday.
Bye.
Uh... do you want juice?
!
- Don't you have any friends?
- None in particular.
- Who drove you to work?
- Where did you see him?
Out the window of Mr Moravia's office.
I don't miss much.
"That's Stiller, a guy I work with."
- How about that woman?
- What woman?
The one that gave you the lunch.
"That's Rose, Stiller's sister."
- Is she your pash?
- My what?
Your passion.
I don't know.
When you're...
"when you're flying all the time, you don't really have much of a chance with women."
I think you hide behind that scar too much.
- You ever do anything with her?
"- What do you mean, ""do anything""?"
"You know what ""do anything"" means."
You're blushing.
Your veins'll be too close to the skin.
I've known people like that.
I'm hungry.
Hey!
Hey!
Wait a minute!
- It's Stiller!
Hey!
- Hey!
- Jimmy!
She works here.
I'm positive.
"She a waitress, bartender, like, what..."
She's a waitress.
I know the manager.
"I'll go talk to him, see if she's on tonight."
"Give me some money, I'll get drinks."
Is that Marla?

Donna was the chef.
Antoine was her number two.
"Back there was Ray and César, they were the kitchen staff."
"Gunther was the catering manager,"
Candace was his assistant.
Lots of other people.
Good people.
"They were here, then they were gone, and nobody came down to say,"
"""Can we please keep them on?"""
It wasn't fair.
You think?
- But Griff is different.
"- Oh, yes, he is."
Because they didn't do anything to deserve to be turfed.
I cast that cat myself.
"And sir, while they are my-- Ow!"
Aaugh!
"No, no, no, no, no."
He's okay.
I need you to talk for two minutes.
About what?
Anything.
All right.
"These cats are more than just pets, sir."
"Why, just this morning--"
Excuse me!
Where is the manager?
"I'm from the government, and I'm here to inspect your chicken nuggets."
Uh-oh.
Look at Shorty.
This honky grandma be trippin'.
"What's up, America?"
I'm coming into your house live.
"Lemme hear you say ""We love you, Tracy."""
"We love you, Tracy!"
I am the third heat!
He's brilliant.
Are you drunk?
Yes.
Why did you fire Pete?
Why did you disappear all night?
Is this some kind of a power play?
"Yeah, yeah."
"It's not so fun being ""hands on"" with these bloodsuckers, is it?"
Could we talk about this on Monday?
No.
You can use these for the posterior.
"Let's face it ladies, what man doesn't like a little ""junk in the trunk""?"
So...
"What do you say, girls?"
Who wants to be bootylicious?
I think I'm bootylicious enough.
Whoo.
Uh...
Hi.
Excuse me.
Um...
I'm meeting someone here.
The reservation is under Elise Lacey.
Oh.
Hi.
Your date's waiting for you.
Follow me.
"Oh, really?"
Is he normal?
- I wouldn't exactly say normal.
- Really?
You must be Kitty.
That's very good.
Thanks.
"I'll be back to tell you about specials in a minute, senator."
Thank you.
I never would've figured you for a silent treatment type.
I'm not giving you silent treatment.
I'm considering how I can tell you off without losing my job.
- You're angry.
- Yes!
Yes.
Where are they?
- You can't just barge in here!
- Where are they?
I ain't seen them.
They're not here.
Bollocks.
- Don't lie to us.
"- 'Ere, I know you."
Have a heart and tell me.
What happened to my son John?
She doesn't know.
Right.
"Well, John's dead."
Where are the other two?
A man we identified as John Bentley was killed in an explosion at the British Savings Bank...
- All right.
Now she knows.
"- Daniel Mitcham... and our colleague, Detective Inspector Leonard Bradfield."
We need to know where Clifford and David are.
I ain't seen 'em.
There's no-one here.
Right.
I'm sick of this.
- Where are they?
- I don't know.
- Who told you about John?
- What?
It was on the wireless.
"We haven't released that information yet, so who told you John didn't get away?"
Nobody.
A Bentley till the bitter end?
Deal with her.
"And we don't want it opened up again, do we, Basil?"
"No, you don't, dear."
No.
"The great warning-off of May 8th, yes."
"Good old Saint George, eh, Major?"
"Well, he killed a hideous fire-breathing old dragon, didn't he?"
"Ran it through with a lance, I believe."
Mr. Fawlty!
Mr. Fawlty!
Is Missus...
room no like.
She want speak to you.
Is problem.
"Ever see my wife making toast, Polly?"
"Why... why'd he kill it anyway, Fawlty?"
"I don't know, Major."
Better than marrying it.
Marrying it?
"But he didn't have to kill it, though, did he?"
"I mean, he could've, uh, just not turned up at the church."
"Good morning, Madam."
Can I help you?
- Are you the manager?
"- I am the owner, Madam."
- What?
- I am the owner.
I want to speak to the manager.
"- I am the manager, too."
- What?
I am the manager as well.
Manaher.
He manaher.
"You know, i thought it might be him."
Oh.
"Well, what happened?"
Did you come to any conclusions about anything while you were out?
Mmm.
"I'm okay, ma."
I'm really okay.
- You sure?
Talk to me.
- I...
I just feel like...
Remember saul on the road to damascus.
Of course.
I used to read you that story.
Do you remember when god struck him and he went blind?
- Yes.
Yes.
- He went blind for three days
"And then when he came back,"
You remember how he saw the error of his ways?
"Mm-Hmm, yes."
"Well, i was running today..."
- Mm-Hmm.
- ...and i was trying to clear my head.
"I was trying to hear from god, mama..."
- Oh.
- ...and i just started looking at people going by.
I saw this mother.
She was playing with her kids.
She was pushing her child on the swing.
"And, mama, that..."
The mother looked like
Hold on.
I'm gonna put you on speaker.
Thepresident'swithme.
"This guy, Stenz.."
made multiple calls to a secure line in D. C..
but we don't know who received them.
The database was wiped 30 minutes ago.
Really?
Did you check Walker's personal records?
"His computer, his emails?"
"You don't know Walker, John."
He was a dinosaur.
The man still used a pager.
"Oh, shit."
Listen.
"Carol, I got to check something out."
We'll see you outside.
I don't believe it.
"I think I know how Walker got the codes, but I'm gonna need your help, sir."
Move back!
Move back.
Emily.
"Oh, baby, you okay?"
"Oh, thank God."
"Thank God, baby."
Did you see my routine?
Yeah.
"Oh, I'm so proud of you."
"You were beautiful, baby."
You saved us.
You know that?
"Hey, stay with Mommy for a second, okay?"
We just got back off tour.
"- You had a band, didn't you?"
- We're Silicone Valets.
"- You didn't teach these Flop Idols, did you?"
"- Yeah, tried to."
For me sins.
"- Too rebellious to teach, us."
"Weren't we, Miss?"
- No.
Just too thick.
"- Do us a quarter, will ya, Moz?"
"- Oh, two quarters for me."
Cheers.
"Quarters, eh?"
You are doing well.
"Oh, yeah."
Now who's thick?
Keep the change.
"Well, you completely cleared me out."
I'm gonna have to have a major restock.
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
"Ah, well, better get back."
- Nice to see you both.
- Yeah.
"Oh, actually this is our first EP."
"It's called ""Exhibit A""."
Thanks.
"Hope the teaching works out, Miss."
"Yeah, I know I couldn't handle a load of kids screaming' at me every day."
"No, 'cause that's for successful bands, i'nt it?"
Bye.
"All right, fella?"
Not at all.
"The only drawback of cupping is, it leaves a suction mark."
It can bruise a little.
Cupping?
"Yes, ancient Chinese secret."
All the celebrities do it.
"It draws out toxins, boosts metabolism."
You'll feel good.
[ Exhales deeply ] Who knew?
[ Yawns ]
"Oh, excuse me."
It's just so relaxing in here.
It's the aromatherapy.
The lavender really packs a punch.
Huh.
Ahh.
Geez.
That's wa-a-a-rm.
[ Snores ]
[ Snoring ]
[ Slurping ]
Flojo.
"You got time to lean, you got time to clean, huh?"
I'm starving.
What do we get to eat?
Same as the clients.
They expect us to eat this rabbit food?
It's not rabbit food.
It's super food.
I'm not eating it.
[ Sighs ]
"At Canyon Valley, we're supposed to lead by example."
"Everyone's a cousin in Burnley, Calum!"
"Mate, I'm not joking."
"I was on the dancefloor, this tune was playing."
I had my hand up both of their skirts at the same time.
It was like I was dancing with Sooty and Sweep!
"Very suave, man, very suave."
"Oh, mate, that will be a little surprise package I've arranged for us this evening."
But without wanting to give the game completely away...
"They're twins, they're from Macedonia and"
They don't have keys.
Shit.
You.

"No, no."
Ha ha ha.
John Mercer.
I'm not staying here.
Where was it you two shared a cell again?
"Pentonville, wasn't it?"
I'm not staying here.
He's an idiot.
That's a bit harsh.
Granted he's no Steven Hawking.
"John mate, don't be like that."
"Don't John mate me, please."
I'm not staying here.
You don't want to live with him?
Fine.
"- No, he says she's nearby."
Where do the Andersons live?
"Uh, Indian Village."
- That's 3 miles away.
- Let's go.
"[Woman] Here you go, hon."
I found a few more glasses for you.
Tom.
"Oh, my God, Tom!"
[Groaning]
[Kaman] Where is Tracy?
"Sir, I keep trying the Anderson house, but the line's busy."
[Busy signal]
[Garner] He must already be there.
"Garcia, have any fires been reported in the area?"
"Negative, but medics and fire suppression are on the way."
- Good.
Tell them to stand by.
- Roger that.
- There's one more thing I gotta tell you.
- What is it?
[Muttering]
[Kaman] Let's just get honest with each other.
Where is Tracy?
- She's not here.
- You're lying.
I know she's back.
Tracy's going to medical school in Ohio.
I don't believe a damn word come out your mouth!
We have no reason to lie.
"It's been five years, Kaman."
She's moved on with her life.
Something to preserve.
"The blood is fresh, but not human."
"Let's find out, he's at the end of the blood trail."
It smells like something big died.
"Yes, Ash has returned in his suit."
"Just smell it in your pussy with your breath, Kix."
Listen to the talk.
Pay attention!
.
"Okay, we split up"
"Come here, little bird."
"Come here, come to Dad!"
Stop the nonsense!
I have goose bumps here!
"Who knows, what is circulating around here."
"All right, I'm going in."
I'll cover you.
Let's go for it!
"You are dead, Kix"
Suck me the dick!
"What do you think this is, Commander?"
Noid art?
Hey friend.
Fuck you
"Fortunately, he is dead."
Let's take a blood sample.
Shit!
Hatta!
Hatta!
"Shit, I can not aim!"
I'm going out!
Son of a bitch have to pay!
"""Of shoes and ships and sealing wax."""
"""Of cabbages and kings."""
"""And why the sea is boiling hot."""
"""And whether pigs have wings.""'"
- Do you have any wings?
- Yeah.
Let me see.
Crap?
"No, no."
This stuff is beyond crap.
This is what crap wants to be when it grows up.
Listen to this.
"""A Question Corner by Marion Hawthorne."

Mom and Dad's night out.
Me and Golly's night in.
Hello.
What's that smell?
Delicious German bratwurst.
We hate bratwurst.
I love bratwurst.
Since when?
I'll get it!
No.
"No, no."
How can we go anywhere?
"- You're not dating her, then."
- I went to her house and...
- That's not dating.
- Have you gotten anywhere yet?
- No.
- I would have dug in the first 20 minutes.
"- Shut up, man."
- Dude.
"- Anyway, she invited me to a skate party Saturday night."
- It's a rich kids' party.
- Yeah.
"- Oh, yeah."
- This is nice.
Like it?
- Yeah.
- What is this?
250?
- Yes.
- How much?
- Way too much.
That's how much.
- I like it.
"- My mom's making chocolate cake tonight for Tim's birthday, if anyone wants to come over."
- I can't.
My parents want to have some bullshit big talk.
That sucks.
- I thought that Tim and your mom broke up.
- She took him back.
Fucking dick.
Treats her like crap.
Remember that one time when your mom kicked him out of the house?
-Security!
"You, me for one another."
"You and me, no chance!"
"I have a chance, she said no way."
"Carmen, I think he stick to your foot."

"-And then, my friend."

Calm boy Erik is his son?
"Yes, it is."
"Children, let's go."
"Uncle Bud, it's not fair."
Come on you all.
-But this place is so fun.
"Erik, come on."
Not return to the land of the emperors.
Do not be silly.
-I will be here.
But it's personal at home.
His mother must be very worried.
"Erik, you better do what your father says."
But I do not like it there.
"Oh, little one, I'll tell you a secret, right."
Sometimes when you are a little different the world laughs at you.
-Right.
-Yes.
"Think you are funny, pointed wings."
We have a saying Insvelândia there.
Believe in yourself Erik Sven because they believe in you.
Can I ask?
-Yes.
"Oh, we can."
And we will.

MANSLEY:
"Yes, sir."
"This thing is real, sir."
"I not only have incontrovertible evidence, General,"

"I don't know who built it, but it's here."
It's massive and we're running out of time.
There's no doubt we should act.
"The only question, sir, is..."
Can you afford not to?
"Excellent, sir."
You won't regret it.
"Thank you, sir."
"The Army arrives in the morning, Hogarth."
Don't get cute.
I gotta warn Dean.
I'll be watching you.

I've been waiting for you.
You actually dare to cheat in front of me.

So I have to spell it out now?
I don't like you.
Bastard!
Miss Kim Na Na.
Hey.
Miss Kim Na Na.
She completely lost her spirit.
Here.
"Thank you for the kiss, agent."
What is this?
Money.
There are several zeros on it right?
"Here, 1 million Won."
Good bye.
Does it hurt?
"You have thick skin like walls, so it shouldn't hurt."
"For medical costs, right?"
"Hey, Shin Eun Ah."
What?
President's daughter disappeared?
"No, she did not come here."
Never a rumpus here.
Most orderly.
"It's that girl, lvy, that barmaid."
Pretty girls always cause trouble.
- I'd throw her out if I were you.
- What?
Lvy?
I can't do that to Ivy.
A great man can always change his mind for a reason.
"Yes, sir."
"Why, certainly, sir."
"Yes, sir."
"A troublemaker, that's what she is."
Out she goes.
"Yes, but now, while the evening is still young."
"- Yes, sir."
"Certainly, sir."
"- Yes, certainly."
What happened?
I've done nothing.
Just minding my own business.
"- That's my decision, my girl."
- Stop pushing!
- Don't hang about here.
- Who's hanging about?
- Go on.
Don't argue the point.
"- Oh, good riddance."
What's happened in there?
"- Is there some trouble, lvy?"
- Trouble?
"I was sacked, that's what!"
"Well, sir, I guess I am a lucky guy at that."
"You know, I hardly ever lose a coin toss."
"Go to the horse races in Hot Springs, bet on a long shot."
Damn if the son of a bitch doesn't come in.
My mom used to always tell me I was born under a lucky star.
CASHIER:
What you got there?
WOMAN:
A couple rolls of film.
"Baby, there's an article in here about Julia from Dark Memories."
That ain't Julia.
That's that damn twin sister...
With her evil self.
"No, it's not."
Can you tell him who this is?
That's Julia on Dark Memories.
Mmm-hmm.
Told you.
Got any maps of Houston?
We don't need no damn map of Houston.
PLUTO:
"Be cool, Ray, be cool."
CASHIER:
"Good, Bill."
How are you?
BILL:
It's real quiet out there.
We got the two most exciting jobs in town.
(MICROWAVE BEEPING)
LILA:
"Your other burrito's ready, baby."
He's watching me.
It was Roth who tried to kill me in my home.
It was Roth all along.
"He acts like I'm his son, his successor."
But he thinks he'll live forever and wants me out.
-How can I help?
"-Just go along, as if you know nothing."
-I've already made my move.
-What move?
Hyman Roth won't see the New Year.
"You're to take it easy, he'll be back tomorrow."
Fly in my own doctor from Miami.
I don't trust a doctor who can't speak English.
"-Gracias, señor."
-Buenas noches.
"-Honey, go to the casino."
-If you're feeling better.
Feel fine.
-Play the bingo game.
-Okay.
"Nice to see you, Mr. Paul."
My sixth sense tells me Fredo brought a bag full of money.
Where is it?
-You're pulling out?
-Just want to...
Just want to wait.
-How do you feel?
-Terrible.
I'd give four million to be able to take a painless piss.
-Who had Frank Pentangeli killed?
-The Rosato brothers.
"I know, but who gave the go-ahead?"
I know I didn't.
Anyone called me?
"Oh, daughter, the veggie caviar worked out real good, with a soul to it!"
- I asked you:
Did anyone call?
- I can't hear you for all that music!
"Ira, I beg you, turn that stupid music off!"
Stop it now!
Go to your room!
I'm sick and tired of all this!
All right!
What's the matter?
My little baby...
"Nina, why is she like that?"
Like what?
A normal city child.
They're all like that in kindergarten.
They got a load of things to do.
I asked you:
Did anyone call me?
"- Well, did they?"
- I had no time to tell.
Someone did.
What's wrong?
Have you lost something?
Have you?
- Someone called?
- Yes.
It was embarrassing.
"I took it up, they say nothing."
"I yelled, then someone says politely:"
This is Ghena.
"And then he asks, you know:"
We gotta go
(Door closing)
"Coming to the stage, from the BX."
(Cheering and clapping)
"Please welcome, the one, the only..."
Vanessa!
(Cheering and applauding)
"It cracks and clicks and the glass it rips to pieces,"
Too sharp.
I sometimes slip between the creases
I been building out your weakness.
(Woman) Wow.
Brow and bone structure bent to your likeness.
I like this.
Live in the middle with a piece of mind.
Make like a mirror and turn me lovely.
"Face to face, and say you love me."
(Woman) Yes!
(Woman) Yes!
(Crowd cheering) Yes!
"(Woman) Aw ma, you did your thing up there."
I'm proud of you.
Thank you.
Let me talk to you for a second?
"Okay, you have one second... go."
"So I'm saying, I think you look mad sexy."
You here with somebody?
Yeah.
"All right, that's cool, ma."
I'm kidding.
I'm here with my friends.
"Got you, got you."
And where do you think you're going?
"Oh, I thought I'd try my luck in Haematology."
I know what you are.
"So, you know what I'll do if you come any nearer, Goldie."
"- What, like the rapper?"
"- No, the Blue Peter dog."
"Oh, right, yeah, cos..."
"Oh, yeah."
"That's, um... cutting."
"But, you know, having worked with drunks in AE for two years, it takes a little more than that to scare me."
"Look, I'm not some naughty little kid."
"Yeah, draining a defenceless old man of blood is a step beyond naughty."
Now... settle!
"OK, um... just keep telling yourself, ""I've got this job."""
I've turned up.
I have got this job.
"Ah, the banks have crunched."
Do not get cocky.
"Oh, thank you."
Thank you so much for the vote of confidence.
"Mm, and keep saying the interviewer's name."
That builds a bond.
"Like, ""Yes, Ken."
"You're right, Ken."
"""I totally agree with you..."
"Ken."""
- See?
- Mr Mitchell.
- Yeah.
- Don't call her Ken.
Hmm.
Seriously.
Somewhere east of here.
I've heard there may be children there.
Voilà!
How on earth did you manage that?
"Garden centre, piece of cake."
- Perfect!
- Thank you!
Look at Naj.
Never seen him so happy.
Maybe he'll move in with them!
"Come on, we're naming the chickens."
- Why?
- Cause no-one eats pets with names.
Got to be something that suits them.
- Nugget?
- Something nice.
Korma?
- What happened to you?
- Car crash.
Suits you.
Both.
Are you OK?
We're naming the chickens.
"You can have one, but you'll have to share."
- Otherwise Abby won't get one.
- She not back yet?
That one there.
Eagle Eye.
What do you reckon?
Look at him.
He knows exactly what's going on.
You couldn't get anything past him.
-Come on!
-Let's go!
Bring Sandra back to her room first.
Why?
Is there a problem?
I'm pregnant.
I had my check up with Dr. Gamboa.
It's already 7 weeks old.
I'm having such a hard time.
Your husband will come back to you!
So stop crying now.
Stop crying.
"When his memory comes back, who else will he come home to?"
What if his memory doesn't come back?
"Whatever pain was caused by your relationship with Migs, it also has beautiful memories."
"And most of all, stop pleading or begging on that Bela."
Her conscience will haunt her more if you have no connection.
Do you still love Migs?
.
Yes.
I love Migs so much.
You have to wait for him to get better.
"Migs, stop it!"
Come on!
-Why?
I used to do that.
-No.
Oh!
"Wait, I forgot something."
-I'll come back.
-Okay then.
What?
I'm about halfway through.

[Fire alarm beeping]
[Groans] Damn it.
Ah-ha!
"- [Beeping stops, magazine thuds]"
- God.
I've got such a headache.
That makes two of us.
The only thing helping me is this sweet tea.
- I swear I'm addicted to it.
- My lord!
[Chuckles]
What... what is happening in here?
"We wanted to say ""thank you,"" so we cooked for you."
[Laughs]
And at what ungodly temperature did we cook these eggs?
"Um, the temperature you cook eggs at... high."
"Ah, yeah, really hot."
"[Chuckles] Yes, well, that is not cooking, Nate."
That is an egg-secution. [Chuckles]
"- Hey, before we leave..."
I love music.
I like all kinds of music.
"Maybe he'll talk to you now, I think."
Prop him up in the chair f acing the wall.
I can't bear the sight of your handiwork.
"And don't put that thing away, in case."
In case there's more music?
"There he is, all tuned up f or you."
That's better.
"You're a stubborn man, Mr. Murdock."
"Your whole attitude, I find thoroughly aggravating."
What time is it?
That seems a little beside the point.
"It happens to be 10:45, or thereabouts."
"You're licked, Martinelli."
"Quarter to 11, manager, Hotel Southern will phone me here."
- Don't f all f or that.
- Shut up.
"Yes, Mr. Murdock?"
Do go on.
I'm interested.
He's just making with the mouth.
"Wrong, as usual."
Yes?
"-That, mostly."
"It's been pretty bad, Doc."
Where's Jim;
-Waiting at the hotel.
-Waiting;
To take the children home after you've seen them.
Oh.
Did he mind about my seeing them;
Take all of it!
The monster took my shoe!
- Candy!
"- Yay, treats."
I love treats.
- Felicia.
"- Hi, Daddy."
That was a nice grip you had on that big fat kid.
"Farkle, excellent work with your teeth."
"- Fergus, my lad."
"- Daddy, Daddy, Daddy."
We're gonna have to work on your timing.
"All in all, not bad for your first Halloween."
They're growing up so fast.
And look who got her first clump of hair.
Did you see?
Farkle got him in the ankle.
- What about little Fergus?
- Nothing yet.
"That's all right, sweetie."
Mama didn't get a scare this year either.
"Fear not, my love."
The night is still young.
Hold the phone.
Who left the door open?
You don't think that someone's inside?
"Now, who'd be stupid enough to break into an ogre's house?"
"Oh, wow."
Terrifying.
I don't know how I'm gonna sleep now.
"Happy Halloween, everyone."
"- Oh, man."
They are my family.
I will hear of it if they are not treated well.
My cabin is theirs.
Mr. Jones...
"I've heard a lot about you, sir."
Your appearance is exactly the way I imagined.
Good-bye.
Look after each other.
I am already missing you.
You're my good friend.
Sallah.
That is for Fayah... that is for your children... and this is for you.
Thank you.

I got a feeling I'm not the first woman ever to travel with these pirates.
It's lovely.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Really?
Yeah.
What'd you say?
Wait...
I don't need any help.
You know you do.
"Working freelance, you must always do good work."
Or be jobless before you know it.
I know I suck.
C'mon.
Think on the bright side.
At least during New Year this time you can relax at home like everyone else.
It will be a new experience for you.
"Anyway, I got to go."
I got a briefing.
Bye.
Happy holidays.
You ready to be happy for once?
From today lots of people start traveling home.
And plan to travel around here and abroad.
"Only the first day, I'm already going insane."
Damn I'd die for a job now.

Happy New Year son.
"Stay healthy, and take good care of yourself."

"The photo I asked you to retouch, when will I get it?"
"It's not that kind of work, mom."

To do what?
Addons All gifts.
Addons The decision is yours.
If you want to keep a good boy.
I quit.
Addons
- Gwen.
- Yes.
Addons you recognize this?
"recently,youhavecompleted online tests, such as that."
"Yes, and?"
Addons This test is called:
"""What kind of lover are you?"""
Addons So ...
What kind of lover you are?
Yes ...
Let us know!
Addons
- Repeat the question.
"- No, that's good."
"I say that the test is the mistress, sadist."
I know.
That's why I was good.
But that stupid test.
I make time to go.
The test was wrong?
Is not it?
Well ...
"I'm not sadistic, implies that if."
"Your answer was given to Addons and results, but lying a few questions, right?"
I do not know ...
"I have not taken seriously, to be honest."
Addons This is a question to the 4 ...
Oh.
"So, who's first?"
Uh...
[Chuckles]
Um... tell you what.
"Uh, why don't you let me tie you up first?"
Then how am I gonna be able to do all the terrible things that I've got planned for you?
"[Laughs] Oh, I'm sure you'll figure something out."
"[Chuckling] Isn't that right, Kendall?"
Kendall...
Kendall?
Damn it.
She's gonna miss all the fun.
[Grunts]
You've been had.
That dirty little...
[Chuckles]
I'm getting tired of chasing you.
"Well, there's no rule against taking a short break."
[Laughs]
[Alarm blaring]
What the hell?
"Hey, where's your friend?"
Huh?
Castle:
Thought we had a deal.
No more double-crosses.
"Sorry, Ricky, but I am going to be the one to take those trophies in."
Castle:
"Well, good luck with that, because I'm looking for a murder weapon."
"It's a unique blade, but I guess you wouldn't know that."
- You're lying.
.
-I'll introduce you to my childhood best friend.
-But why will I meet her just now?
"-Because she came from Canada, she just arrived."
-Make sure she's just your best friend okay?
-Yes!
Come on!
What?
"You know, Migs and I have been playing together since we're 2 years old."
"As a matter of fact, he's my first boyfriend!"
How old was I when I answered you?
"-Around 1 6, right?"
-What 1 6?
Around 1 5 and three fourths!
-Come on.
-So you've been a couple.
Yes!
"We're childhood sweethearts, right?"
"I'm sorry, I thought Migs told you."
"No, it's okay!"
I was just surprised because he never mentioned that to me.
Haven't I told you about it?
"You know, why don't you guys tell me how you met?"
Oh!
It's like this.
"We were together in the hospital, she's a nurse there."
There it is!
Hence the uniform!
Then it's okay that you're together!
"Are you okay, Joy?"
.
Are you okay?
Damn it!
Goddamned it!
I don't want to!
"I don't want to die, Helene."
Why?
"Praise be to God, our Lord Jesus Christ   who by his great mercy has granted us hope   in the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead."

"Good-bye, Dad."
- Mr. Jacob!
- Pramod!
"Pramod, come here."
I missed you.
"Oh, I missed you."
- Have you been fine?
"- Yes, everything is very good."
What is this?
You're so tall.
Let me have a look at you.
Let me see.
"Oh no, Pramod."
You're taller than me.
What is this?
And you got new goals and everything.
- Are you happy with that?
- Yes.
- Did you miss me?
- Much.
I want to ask you about something.
"You don't have to answer right away, because I'm staying all week."
"How would you like to come and live with me, in Denmark?"
Is the cadaver in your way?
We could...
We could move it across the street if you like.
I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.
"So, how did it go upstairs?"
Fine.
Is that your boyfriend?
"Oh, no, this is my boss."
"This is Adrian Monk, who is a hugely famous detective."
He solves...
"Natalie, who does your hair?"
"Oh, God."
"Well, you take your time."
Okay?
"I'll just be over here at the crime scene, if anybody's interested."
Natalie?
"My mom's in the hospital, and it would mean so much to her if you would take a picture with me."
Please?
- Okay.
Thanks.
Murder!
Or suicide.
Or murder.
It's a tough call.
Yeah.
This is a tough one.
"In many ways, this reminds me of the killer astronaut case"
I solved last year.
You probably read about it.
"Hey, Monk?"
Look at this.
"I do know that often, when Stan and I are together, this happens."
And you believe?
"It happens, Mr. Gordon."
"When I was a kid, a tenement on our block collapsed."
Buried some people alive.
"From then on, every time I passed that spot,"
I believed I could always hear them moaning and crying for help.
You through there?
Get started upstairs.
"Why don't you go to bed, Stan?"
Why should I?
Because you make me sick to my stomach.
Douglas...
"All right, Stan."
"You've had enough, let's go."
Mr. Gordon will excuse you.
Let's go.
Excuse me?
Do you think I had too much to drink?
"Whoa, wait."
Wait a minute.
Wait.
"Good night, my dear."
Mr. Gordon.
"Let's go, Dougie."
Come on.
Here we go.
I want to show you that I can be neighbourly too.
Lynn?
"Well, he's in bed."
Probably dead to the world by now.
"Thank you, Doug."
It isn't ladylike.
I don't want to be ladylike.
"Yes, you do."
"That's why you're joining the Honeybee Scouts, so you can play with normal kids instead of those two animals."
I'm getting cleaned!
I don't want to be a Honeybee Scout.
I like rockets and computers.
So marry an astronaut.
"But for now, go play with those girls down there doing girl stuff."
Dad!
- What're you guys doing?
- Waking up fish.
Cool!
I give up.
"Christ, she's got bigger balls than Bill."
Fight for my pleasure!
That jerk ruins everything fun.
We have to stand up to him this year.
"I just curl into a ball and sing ""Hot Cross Buns."""
No!
There's two of us and one of him.
"If we both fought him at the same time, there's no way he..."
Ow!

- What are you talking about?
"I was meant to give it to someone else, and he knows you have it, Harry."
- You're talking about the bracelet?
"- I know you're a good man, which is why I gave it to you instead of him but he'll come after you."

It's true.

"However, all the kids don't necessarily stay in."
"Well, you could have put that in the flyer."
(Sighs) Please.
You don't get it.
She never makes anything.
You can't tell her this.

And help all the others.
Do you promise to come to my birthday?
I swear.
And I'll be calling you every other day.
Okay?
"And that's not going to be a lot of times, because I'll be home in 8 days."
Perhaps you can take me there one day.
Perhaps.

Konda Reddy somehow knew about our people trying to escape.
They are taking away small children.
I tried to save a few.
But they found them.

"Velu, don't worry about me."
We must save these people.
Kill him.

"Konda Reddy, you think you can kill me?"
My son will surely send you to hell.
"If you are a real man, fight with him."
I brought you the best seafood.
It was the Mano-there he is.
Hi.
He asked me.
-It is my language.
I'm sorry.
If direction is not the feeling satisfied.
Can I get more.
"No Sven, I bet you have others more hungry than me."
I understand.
See you at dinner?
I'm kinda busy.
Kinda busy.
Even more!
She is beautiful.
"Honey, are you okay?"
Are you sure he no relation to Ramon?
You Ingracia!
"Should not scoff at someone, just because it's different."
Even someone who is having more a lot of work to save us.
-You are right.
When Sven- teach them all to fly.
It will be a rising up.
"-Erik, not ..."
-Get out of here.
-You will see.
Who dropped the fish?
"Guys, what's happening with the fish?"
Fish friends what's the problem?
The birds eat.
"Sven, you must fly on the wings of hope and ask them to help brothers emperors."
I'd love to know but ...
I remember something like that.
"I like to poke Michael, because..."
You're so cute when you flinch.
When you recoil with horror.
"Poke, poke, poke."
- Here's some hotness.
- These guys are good.
- Sexy.
- Great chemistry.
"I don't know why, but these guys..."
"They, like, auditioned together, right?"
Norah!
Norah!
Norah!
"Oh, my God, Pete."
This is that crazy shot where they had like...
"They put the wall back, remember?"
"When it goes all the way around, someone was putting the wall back."
- Really?
"- Yeah, it was like a 3-D shot."
"- Oh, my gosh."
- This one was...
This was cake icing on my hand.
- It was?
- Yup.
- It looked like paint.
- Have a sweet dessert.
"- After this, you licked your fingers?"
- I licked that wall.
Check out Mike's performance here.
"Oh, well, there's a..."
What?
"One call to Dale, we're back on track."
Absolutely!
Let's do it.
What is wrong with you?
He threatened us.
Just remember that.
- It is extortion.
- Does that mean he's gotta be dead?
- We're not giving him our money.
- What money?
That worthless scrap of shit?
"Yeah, okay."
"Maybe it's time for your friend, the drug-addicted carpet installer."
"- Oh, Scatter."
- Scatter!
Yeah!
He could help.
This is killing me.
I have slept five hours this whole week.
"- Oh, God, here we go."
- I have dandruff with big flakes.
I've gained two pounds!
Listen to my voice.
I'm losing my instrument.
Shouting isn't helping.
"- [Woman] Hey, Gig?"
- Yeah?
There's a couple of cops in the club asking for you.
- I'll be right in.
"- Oh, great!"
Cops in the club.
I've always wanted to give an inmate fame.

Get the hell out of here.

You've had training.
Some.
don't wake her yet.
Let her sleep another hour.
Logan... without a doubt the most perfect night I've had in a very long time.
But I don't deserve it.
Do I?
I did something.
Something unspeakable.
I've remembered what happened in Westchester.
This is not the first time I've hurt people.
I didn't know.
You wouldn't tell me.
So we just kept on running away from it.
I think I finally understand you.
Logan...
He's fantastic.
You said you only needed the girl!
I told you I was forced to bring a new tool to bear.
Your friends had every chance.
And so did you.
Nate?
Put her down.
Honey.
Will!
Pardon?
Pate maison?
Yes.
Your lunch date.
"It was with a girl, wasn't it?"
"As a matter of fact, yes, it was."
Des ecrevisses?
Oui.
Now I'm going to spoil your fun.
How dreadful of me.
"Don't tease the animals, Mrs. Brown."
You might get bitten.
Du saumon?
Oui.
"My, we're in a bad mood."
Excellent.
"Et vous aussi, monsieur?"
"Nothing for me, thanks."
Tres bien.
Merci.
Why were you and John glaring at each other when I came in?
I told him our product was 20 years out of style.
A lot of people still buy it.
Three times as many would buy furniture like this.
What's that?
Sketches of a new line of modern furniture that we're not bringing out.
May I look?
You can have them.
Are these your own ideas?
"Well, some of them."
I had a designer working on it.
"Oh, I think they're awfully good."
Xiaotian has back.
Aku want to be with him tonight.
Can we watch movie tomorrow night?
I don't have time for tomorrow!
"- Then, the day after tomorrow."
- No time either.
Xiamu.
"Xiamu, it's a gift for you!"
Please take it!
"Xiamu, she has been fall in love with you for a long time!"
Consider I have taken it.
Sorry!
Is this the place?
It can't be wrong.
Why did Zhang Jingyu tell us to go for this place?
This place is not bad!
I'm scared!
Let's just go home!
It's okay!
I'm here with you.
What is going on?
Yawang!
Let go of her!
What is happening?
Run faster!
"Uncle Tang, don't beat Xiaotian anymore!"
- Stop it already!
- Get up!
Go to sport field and run 10 kilometers!
You deserve it!
"Girl who not go home in the midnight, is a bad girl."
"Xiaotian, the time has passed."
Mmm.
It's almost as if Trina has become our very own Lady Di.
"Oh, and I corrected your spelling mistakes."
Thanks.
"Shall we dance, my dear?"
We shall.
Are they?
They live together.
Didn't you know?
No.
Mm-hm.
Wow!
"Wow, indeed."

"Well, I have to say, as far as wakes go, this one was pretty good."
Mum's was better.
"Well, Mum's didn't have nearly as much dancing."
But it did have uncle Terry standing on the balcony shouting at the neighbours like there was no God.
"My brother, the life and soul of every wake."
Wait!
You forgot me!
We thought you were...
Going home... ..where you belong.
No way.
"I mean, Dad's OK today, but tomorrow he'll be bad again."
"We'll go at eight bells, same as before."
"Now, Morrison, get up on deck and warn everyone you meet."
"Wagstaffe, go and tell Dawlish."
You?
Get up aloft.
This time let's hear you cheer.
- Who's on watch?
- Ponsonby.
Where's Scott-Padget?
Where is he?
"All officers confined to their quarters, under guard by Marines."
Listen to me.
I'm warning you.
"You use that knife, and you're a dead man."
"All right, lads."
No rushing on deck.
And wait for the cheer.
"Now, take some more, sir."
You'll stand better what I've got to do.
"Now, get ready."
"Now, grab him."
Look lively!
Put your backs into it!
"All right, you."
Start on number four gun.
Hip-hip-hooray!
What's happening there?
- Leave me alone.
- Shut your mouth.
"Don't move, sir!"
"- This means your death, Vizard."
- Take him below.
I'll say.
Ka-chow.
You're gonna fit right in in California.
My goodness.
It looks like you've helped everybody in town.
"Yeah, everybody except one."
"- Hey, is it getting dark out?"
- What?
What'd he say?
Let me say that again.
Is it getting dark out?
"Now, what was I supposed to do after that?"
They fixed their neon!
- Low and slow?
"- Oh, yeah, baby!"
"Just like in its heyday, right?"
It's even better than I pictured it.
Thank you.
Shall we cruise?
"Oh, thank you, dear."
I'd love to!
"- No, no, no."
- Lizzie!
I remember when Stanley first asked me to take a drive with him.
"Hey, Miss Sally."
May I have this cruise?
"- Of course, Mater."
- Uh-uh-uh!
"...and again and I said, ""No. "" He asked me again, and I said, ""No. """
"But, oh, he was a persistent little bugger for a two-cylinder."
"Finally I said, ""All right, one little drive. """
Oh!
Have fun...
What else?
Loosen up.
Put the pen down.
I'm not going to test you on this.
Come on.
Teach me something.
Anything.
- Okay.
- Mmm-hmm.
"If a ball is thrown up into the air, and its height, H, equals 100 T..."
What are you doing?
Turn around.
Talk to me.
"If T is time in seconds, at what limit is the speed..."
You lost me.
What does that mean?
You have to put it in context.
"- Jazz it up, find some humor in it."
- Humor in calculus?
"- Well, try telling a story."
- A story?
"Once upon a time, there was a ball."
It was thrown into the air.
And its height...
Maybe I should just write books.
"No one understands those, either."
Just kidding.
- Don't give up.
Try it again.
- Tell you another story?
"- Hi, Professor Larkin."
"It-it's not that I wanted him to be sick or anything like that, but I..."
I wanted...
"the opportunity to show him that I could be there for him, you know?"
I haven't always been.
I've been going on and on.
You haven't.
This is what...
"recovery is all about -- you know, opening up, being honest."
Okay.
"So, tell me about you."
"Uh, recovering drunk."

Uh...
I don't know.
Life gets pretty boring when you stop drinking.
What kind of work do you do?
Assembly line -- boring.
Come on.
I told you.
Went on and on and on.
"Well, okay, okay."
"Uh, it is boring."
"Um, but it's super-high-security."
'Cause you mostly do government work.
It's a company called Northrop.
Hi.
"Hey, handsome."
What are you doing here?
"I just, um..."
I wanted to see you.
- I didn't want to go home.
-See you later.
I'm going to have to rent a tuxedo.
Rent a tuxedo!
"Oh, there's got to be a peasant in every outfit."
"He's never changed, has he?"
"Good old... ""Rent a tuxedo."""
"That's laughable, isn't it?"
(chuckles)
Take care.

Fucking hell.
"Sometimes it is easy just to say ""yes""."
"Henry, catch it!"
"Oh, God."
I thought I'd lost forever Henry.
I was so scared.
I was so scared and you fell.
I thought I'd never see you again.
"I love you, Henry."
I love you.
How sweet.
If I took this moment and put it in a cup of tea.
I wouldn't need sugar.

We can go now.

Sacrificing himself to keeping you alive.
Only for my dick... to kill you later.
"Are you sure, Henry?"
Are you sure?
"- I didn't hear a ""no""."
- Brilliant!
"Come over here, Henry."
There doesn't seem to be any problems with his eye.
Just a cut on his lower eyelid.
The match can't continue.
It's fine.
Stop joking.
Captain Tezuka is worried too.
I want to play.
Ten minutes.
"If you don't win in ten minutes, I'll substitute you."
Tezuka.
Alright?
No problem.
Sorry for the wait.
Still playing on?
"Just a little cut, no reason to make a big fuss."
That guy's left-handed.
No way.
You'd better admit defeat.

And I love watching it.

- I guess so.
"Well, yes."
But I've never gone to see anything.
"What else do you do, besides dancing?"
"I love traveling, and I go to the Cinematheque a lot to see films."

It's my favorite.

There will be other missions.
When you're ready.
"But for now, stay put."
-Glad you didn't bring you-know-who?
-Indeed.
Ugh.
When we're ready?
How are we ever supposed to be ready when they treat us like--
Like sidekicks.
My mentor.
My king.
I thought he trusted me.
Trust?
They don't even trust us with the basics.
They've got a secret H.Q. in space.
What else aren't they telling us?
I have a better question.
Why didn't we leave with Speedy?
What is Project Cadmus?
Don't know.
But I can find out.

I got it alright why Johnny had taken a powder.
He'd faked a birth certificate to enlist.

The Yale pin said so.
All I needed was a telephone.
"Sorry, gorgeous. I'd let you have it, only it's long distance."
Yale University.

What college?
"Yale, of course."
"Okay, so it's a university."

"The skull was dented in and there was this, um..."
"His eyes were missing and, um... the bottom half of his jaw was shredded to pieces."

You have to expect the world to start to feel different.
It just feels so hard.
Not as in difficult.
Literally hard.

Like pavement.
And children are soft.
Yeah.
Defenseless.
That's why every day we try to make this world a little safer.

He's fantastic.
And he's cheap.

"- Oh, I don't know."
[LAUGHING]
"Oh, shoot, I didn't bring enough double-stick tape."
Could you run down to the storage room and grab me some more?
Me?
"Yeah, I'd go myself, but I have nice shoes on."
"Oh, nice shoes."
"Yeah, I wouldn't know about that."
I get all my shoes at the car wash.
She works at a car wash?
- Yeah.
- Mm.
[GRO ANS]
"God, my shoes are nice."
I spent $40 on these shoes.
"- Oh, God, I hate those women."
- Which women?
All women.
"I mean, it's enough with them already, right?"
You wouldn't happen to be talking about those meanie moms?
"I'm sorry, I can't afford a personal chef."
I don't have time to take a three-hour yoga class.

Go yourself.
And he calls himself a man!
"Fido, come here!"
It isn't that I...
Thank you.
Lin?
You're a brave woman.
"No, just a woman praying that her family will forgive her."
There is nothing to forgive.
I thought you'd never get here.
- Choppers are coming up the valley.
- Where's Doc?
"Caught one in the back, but he's going to be all right."
Let's get the colonel.

"Becky,that is good to know."

- Bye.
Excuse me.
"Mrs.Collins,you have a call on our house phone."
Who is it?
"She didn't say,but it sounded urgent."
What do you bet it's marcy.
-It was New York.
-Johnny Sack?
What was it?
The fat joke?
I'm sure that didn't help.
Carmine.
"This HUD thing we're into, they wanted a piece of it."
I think they confronted Ralph...
-things went sour.
"-What'd he say, John?"
Wasn't what he said so much as what he didn't say.
We're talking about New York here.
Before we do anything in terms of a payback... you go to your people.
I want a full investigation.
Nobody makes a move until we know what happened.
You understand?
What the fuck?
-What's going on?
-Have a seat.
I'm Dominic.
"I know you don't know me, but...."
You're the guy who broke into Stew Leonard's that time.
You stole all those pork loins.
"Yeah, but that's not why I'm here today."
-We're here to talk about your drug problem.
-What?
"-Jesus Christ, you fucking kidding me?"
"-Sorry, baby, please."
"No, fuck this shit."
You were told once.
"Now, sit down."
Sit down.
Michelle's pregnant.
Dad?
I stabbed him.
I stabbed my husband.
We're gonna get you in a cast later.
You can have everybody sign it.
"You're just gonna have to be prepared for a little bit of itching, okay?"
All right.
You want to talk about it?
No.
I can't.
All right.
Okay.
"I know it feels that way, but, um, you gotta believe me."
There's a lot of people that want to help you.
Okay.
"Well, maybe later."
All right?
You still playing soccer?
Yeah.
Starting fullback.
"Oh, yeah?"
Starting fullback.
"That's, uh..."
"Yeah, see, I don't know anything about soccer."
You could ask me about basketball.
I'm good with the basketball.
"Invented by a doctor, probably to get more patients, 'cause, you know, basketball injuries."
Is my dad gonna be okay?
Dr. Bennett's taking care of him.
He's in good hands.
"Okay, so crits are stable."
Did anyone come to visit me?
who do you mean?
We are all here.
My friend.
Which friend?
Did anyone by the name Deepa visit me?
Deepa?
No.
No one like that had come.
Where is my phone?
Did she call me?
I need to talk to her immediately.
I'll leave.
"Sadhana, wait."
Where are you going?
He is asking about someone called Deepa.
I asked for my phone.
I need to talk to Deepa immediately.
I need to see her.
What is this?
Sadhana was the one who took care of you.
You didn't even talk to her.
"I will talk to her, later."
I need to talk to Deepa now.
Will you give my phone?
What do you think you are doing?
We have been praying for your recovery...
We have spent a lot of money and waited.
You must be happy for getting your vision back.
You are reciting someone random woman's name!
- What did you say?
What?
"But when the lights came back on, it was the donkey who was taking a shower!"
"Oh, my goodness!"
Why would I do that?
Ha ha!
"And right behind you, there was danger!"
"- Oh, man."
- You were paralyzed!
It was a donkey-eating waffle.
"It was packing heat, and it wanted revenge."
I want revenge!
The donkey ran.
But how far can you run when you are on a plate covered in butter wearing a pink tutu?
- No!
- And a sombrero.
- No!
- And a coconut brassiere!
And about to be eaten alive!
"No, please!"
"Please, I'll switch to pancakes!"
- Aah!
"- Num, num, num!"
And the donkey was never seen again.
Hoo hoo hah hah hah hah hah!
But what Puss didn't know is that right behind him was the one thing he feared more than anything else.
- No.
You wouldn't.
- I would.
- You didn't!
- I did!
No!
Anything but that!
No!
"If you're happy, I'm happy."
Don't you feel well?
Is your boss treating you all right?
Forget it.
"Hey, you speak Italian?"
Hide this for me!
Next week I'll come and get it!
"Abbandando, meet my nephew!"
How's business?
"It's good, it's good."
Fanucci's mad.
Says the neighborhood's getting sloppy.
"People don't pay on time, don't pay the full amount."
Says he's been too nice to everyone.
So Fanucci's changing?
Sure.
He wants double from everybody.
Even from my father.
"I'm a friend, right?"
So you'll let him work here?
I've got some bad news.
I feel rotten about telling you this...
But Fanucci...he's got a nephew...
And you have to give him my job.
"You've always been good to me, ever since I came here."
You looked after me like a father.
I thank you.
And I won't forget it.
Vito!
"Oh, no!"
Take this to your family.
Thanks anyway.
He's the district attorney there.
"All right, we'll handle it."
Anything else?
The last name.
It's gotta be done on Friday.
That's the 13th.
Friday the 13th.
It'll be done the following day.
Some of the boys think it's bad luck to take a contract for the 13th.
We can't push our luck.
"Sorry I can't ask you to stay, Lew."
Gotta get dressed for a dinner.
"Next time, for sure."
Hi.
Come on in.
"I'm Lynn Harper, Mr. Gordon."
Thanks for coming.
I wanted to welcome my new neighbours.
I'm glad you believe in being neighbourly.
Always.
"Come, I'll introduce you to my husband and his brother."
Then we'll have dinner.
Lead the way.
Open the valve.
"Excellent dinner, Mrs. Harper."
Everything was delicious.
Thank you.
And it's Lynn.
"I understand you're in the lumber business, Mr. Gordon."
- Right.
- Does that mean trees or...?
No.
Ugh.
"Oh, I do not want this vacation to end."
"Promise me when we get home, we'll only speak French to each other."
"Oh, ce sera comme nous sommes sur notre propre île privée au paradis."
I was kind of hoping for English with a fake French accent.
But of course.
I had such a good time.
Mm.
And you are really sexy.
"You put the ""moan"" in Mona Lisa."
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.
"You put the ""oomph"" in arc de triomphe."
Ooh.
You put your hands in my pants at the Louvre.
"I know that that's not what we're doing right now, but it was fun."
Yeah.
It was all fun.
"Yeah, it was."
And you know what the best part was?
What?
No Mansfield.
"I mean, you blew off opening a new office in Hong Kong to go to Paris with me, and your boss didn't even call or e-mail or text."
He fired me.
Take a look!
Take a look!
300 workers illegally held 300 workers illegally held
Take a look!
Let them go!
Stand back
Whoever can bring me the head of Fei
Will be my sole adopted son!
"His pride, my pride."
- Please.
- Enough talk.
Time to play the game.
Hello.
Hello-ah.
Friend of yours?
"It's Jonesy, open up!"
Get rid of him.
I'll be listening.
"Luke, Luke, what's going on?"
I've been calling you for hours.
"- Sorry, man."
"- Not a sound, people."
Thought it's gonna be some country house megabash.
"No, it's a total wipeout."
No one here.
Just a few losers.
"- Well, I may as well come and say hi."
"- Seriously, you don't wanna go in there"
"Seriously, I do."
I've been on the road three hours.
"20 pound carried from the station, treading through this mud, to follow your fucking GPS."
"Plus, I've got a shitload of gear that I'm supposed to be shifting tonight."
"Can't let you in, mate."
It's a private party.
Is this some kinda wind-up.
"What's going on, Luke?"
N-Nothing.
- Are you standing me?
- No.
"That's it, isn't it?"
Do yourself a favor.
"When you get home, turn on the Hallmark channel."
Just live in it for a few hours.
"Brian, just stop, all right?"
"- All right, but I just think..."
- Brian.
"Oh, shit, that's Dad's room."
Dad.
You!
You told me to go into the light.
- What?
"- Oh, yeah."
There was a light.
"I almost walked right into the goddamn thing, you ungrateful little shit."
You wanted me dead.
"No, no, no, no, no, no."
And I'm a freaking five?
I said you were making a comeback.
I'm a goddamn ten.
I'm just...
I'm just glad you're alive.
"I know you are, kid."
I'm just breaking your balls.
Look at this.
I've been up ten minutes.
Already my Tinder is blowing up.
"Yeah, all right."
"- How do you feel, Mr. Farrell?"
- Never better.
These comas are a dynamite way to catch up on your sleep.
I might need another one in a couple of months.
Being single is exhausting.
-Hi there.
-Hi.
"Just set it down there, OK?"
Are you studying the stars Miss Sylvia?
Exactly!
Thank you!
Oh my god!
God miss Sylvia?
Oh add out 20 percent.
"Very good, thank you."
"I'm falling asleep I'm tired, I'm falling asleep and you're boring me to death."
"Please don't die, I know you'll love it,"
Hurry up please!
hop
"You'll love it,"
Fuck!
I'm fucking you.
Fucking you...
"Sorry, you're eating."
Oh It's my pleasure.
How did you meeting go with the girl?
She didn't believe me.
Who would believe a man who's capable of waiting till the shrimps get cold?
"Oh, what did you got?"
This is for you.
This is what I drink.
"Oh, thank you."
"Start getting your dinner, I shouldn't start talking about your duty again."
"Here, open it."
Hey you?
Hey you?
What's with these glass arrows in the head?
"""Let me get intoxicated."""
"""I am young."""
"""Show me the magic."""
What are you thinking?
"You know, Gul."
Jaipur will be lonely without you.
And you?
I have become lonely.
It's very late.
I have to go home now.
Can't you cancel it?
What?
Going home?
Mumbai.
"- No way, Karan."
Mumbai is my dream city.
And you know Pia has found such a nice job for me.
I can't lose this opportunity.
And you can lose me.
"Karan, path is meant to take travellers to their destination."
And not to stop them.
Understood?
I am just a path for you?
You are not my destination too.
"Fine, Gul."
"You will meet me once before you leave, won't you?"
Of course.
Go to sleep.
Your daughter has returned.
Ask her where she was the whole night.
Her friends had thrown a bash.
Farewell party.
Are you helping him with his homework?
"Oh, ."
No.
He does it all himself.
"He's getting a ""d."" maybe you should help him."
"Oh, no."
We do.
We do.
We totally do.
"It's just that we can't help him, 'cause we don't really understand it ourselves."
"Okay, okay."
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm going to set aside some extra time...
An evening next week...
To teach parents a math class.
Oh!
That would be so...
Wait.
What?
A class for parents?
Is there a problem?
No.
That just sounds like a lot of work...
For you.
"Welcome, parents."
I'm sure we're all thrilled
"To be here on a night when ""the mentalist"" is on,"
But tonight we're gonna learn...
excuse me.
Ms. Rinsky?
How wonderful.
An interruption.
- We doubly accept.
Does anyone else want to join our little contest?
- I'm in!
"- Ja, wonderbar!"
- Huzzah!
- Okay.
I think I'm going to take the kids out and terrify a few more trick or treaters.
- Will I see you later?
- The night is young.
Trick or treat.
Ahem.
Ahem!
I shall begin.
Once upon a midnight dreary...
"There was this crazy albino guy with a hook, and he lived in a mirror!"
"And if you even look at him, you'd wake up in bathtub full of ice with your kidneys gone!"
Well...
"Hey, hold on."
I didn't say we were doing this here.
- Uh...
What?
- You named the terms.
I name the place.
"Okay, fine."
Where we gonna do this?
- Castle Duloc?
"- Oh, ha ha."
"Very funny, Shrek."
But this is where Lord Farquaad lived!
Ja.
Und died.
I heard it's haunted by his ghost!
How?
I've got no place to work.
What's wrong with the country?
MaIIefiIIe is there.
"The children do need a tutor, but..."
I just can't stand the sight of him any more.
I tell him outright I want him to leave and he plainly refuses.
"I'm a coward, of course."
I can never simply boot my lovers down the stairs.
- Ha!
- What?
Why don't you stay here in Paris and write?
Because alfred's here.
I've got to go somewhere.
"Anywhere, I don't know."
"Maybe I should just curl up and die, yes?"
"Listen, BuIoz."
"I need 3,000 francs now."
Let me read this... and we'II talk tonight at the Baroness Laginsky's party.
I hadn't planned to attend.
alfred might be there.
I know for a fact that he won't.
AII right.
- What's that?
- marvellous.
- Her memoirs?
Am I in it?
- No!
This bit's about her childhood.
"You'II come in later, after she chews up her husband and a hundred others."
It's true.
She's a cannibal.
You're confused.
He's confused you.
- It's very confusing.
- Don't move!
"I said, don't move.!"
I mean business.
Goddamn it.!
Would you think about what you're doing.!
This guy's a scumbag.!
He doesn't want you!
He's only using you!
Come on!
Put the gun down!
Back away from Jack now!
- You've gone completely crazy.
You know that?
- Thanks for noticing.
How do you plan to get us out of this one?
Watch me and weep.
"It takes all kinds, Dalt."
"Okay, Bill, Wendy, I hope you're getting this."
They are walking directly towards the helicopter... and they're staring at me like a couple of crazed dogs.
I'm gonna try to get a word from them if I can.
"This is unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen."
This...
"- Oh, my..."
- Get out of there.
"- Let's go, pal."
Let's go.
- I'm being asked...
- Come on!
Go!
Take it!
Go!
"Hold it, lady, what are you doing?"
Looking for somebody!
Who are you looking for?
Chao Fung-wu.
Chao Fung is at a chess game with his master and Highness.
Having a chess game?
I'll join them.
His Highness has ordered that there be no disturbance.
It's alright!
I won't tell anybody if His Highness loses.
What are you doing?
I'm just looking for his student.
No!
No?
Surround her!
This is ridiculous!
"Go away, or we'll do something!"
I won't leave unless I see Fung-wu.
Brother!
"Yan-ling, why do you figtht with them?"
You better go away with your sister.
And don't disturb the chess game!
The chess game?
He's playing chess with Mr. Law!
You came to find Fung-wu.
"Yes, they just won't let me in."
Mr. Royal Guard!
We are friends of His Highness.
You should at least tell Fung-wu that she's here.
That's right!
Where d'you get the girl make up?
Andrew's sister.
She used to tell us about that ....
Kid from the Burger Palace.
"He got his face bashed in so bad in Juvie, he couldn't talk for a month."
It's why he's got the weird scar.
Hm.
I saw the kid that stabbed a guy like two months ago.
"Well, I guess it's best you sat out there then, uh?"
Hey.
You gotta do better.
The qualification for nationals is in two weeks.
Good.
"Hey, we need the video camera [knock]"
Yeah Lance get some clothes on.

"Hey man, where's your mom?"
"-Shit, I don't know."
So you wanna come or...

"[Incoming car, doors open]"
[Dog barking]
[Knock]
What 'you want Pam?
Thank you.
Would you like a drink?
- No.
I am good.
"I know your speciality, Gul."
"You are handling Umbrella Creations' account, aren't you?"
"Yes, Mr. Bajaj."
There is one thing common between us.
A hunger for success.
I can sense that about you.
I see the same hunger in you.
"You want to be very, very successful."
Nothing wrong with that.
The only difference is you work too hard.
I have a philosophy.
Party hard.
And work smart.
For instance this waiter.
How many hours does he work?
10?
12?
14?
"I mean, I don't know."
How much money does he earn?
Look at me.
I work for three to four hours.
And both of us know how much money I earn.
That's why I have an offer for you.
Join my company.
Get my company Umbrella Creations' contract.
"Salary, whatever you want."
A dream house.
Right.
Right.

I'd be mad if I didn't.

Do you mind if I imbibe?
Do you mind if I imbibe?
Sure.

"Know that, Mr Trimbole."

Enjoy your lunch.
Enjoy your lunch.
When's that?
When's that?
"Um, yeah, that would be fine."
"Um, yeah, that would be fine."
OK.
"Hey, listen, can I give you a call back?"
OK.
"Hey, listen, can I give you a call back?"
"Alright, see ya."
A wee little thing like you should be enjoying yourself.
Do you like to get high?
"Mm, naughty girl."
I only have this much.
"Uh, we can do blowbacks."
"Oh, it's been a while since I've had that... but I don't think so."
Do you have a light?
"Hm, sure!"
I knew I would be of some use.
Stupid fucking bitch!
You don't know anything.
Isn't it time you fucked off?
Back to Wisconsin or whatever fucking hole you came from!
"Brandeis was a front, obviously... to launder money, right?"
"So what, your Dad didn't think he had enough?"
The Bank was fucked.
Dad compartmentalized.
He was trying to save the ank.
How?
How?
Elena.
Who is she?
You're missing a fantastic party.
What are you doing?
"Oh, relax, Mom!"
"Marcello, go back outside."
"Irina, hold on..."
Don't she's a child!
I'm not a child.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Adriana!
"Plus, I get Dannon points."
- Ooh.
"- I'll be stackin' dairy, homie."
"Oh, mama!"
"Dude, look at the craftsmanship of this bow."
"The guy behind the counter, he said that this is the same one they used to light the torch at the Lillehammer Olympics."
"Ooh, nice."
- I think that was Muhammad Ali.
- My dad's gonna flip.
But I'm not sweating it.
'Cause this crossbow's gonna shoot a bow so hard it's gonna explode a deer's head.
Git 'er done.
"Yeah, git 'er ""dune."""
"Thank you for the vest, by the way."
I feel like I'm in SWAT.
Colin Farrell...
"""Get at me!"
"Get at me!"""
"L.L. Cool J, ""get at me!"""
"And Ders, thank you for charging this to the game."
"Oh, what?"
Whale Wars?
Just friggin' harpoon guns?
"I don't know how it works yet, but..."
- Yeah.
That's not how.
- Yeah.
"Wait, so now you're on board to hunt?"
I thought you weren't really down for it.
Yeah.
"Yeah, but fish aren't animals."
They're like the rodents of the sea.
- She's adorable in any outfit.
She is.
Damn her.
I looked like...
I literally look like a man who is...
Like a man who's...
A big man in this school uniform.
I don't know what you're talking about.
- Who invented that?
- You're nuts.
"- Ari, you look adorable."
"- Oh, thank you, honey."
And I look like crap.
Fluffy.
- Fluffy.
Fluffy.
- Fluffy.
Fluffy.
"- Here we are, two girls..."
- Exuberant.
...off into the night.
You just came out of that door looking like you're surprised that you came out of that door.
- How did you achieve that?
- What does that mean?
You came out of the door like you didn't expect to.
Maybe one of the one of the ADs just pushed me out.
"- Oh, right."
- I didn't realize that we were rolling.
"Is it true that there's only, like, a few Yugos in the world?"
Here's a story:
I hit my head here really hard.
- It hurt.
My mother says she's well.
Has she eaten or not?
"Yesterday evening, she took her a meal."
She didn't touch it.
My young uncle fed her.
He's fallen out with my mother.
They don't speak.
Why?
He wanted to feed her?
No.
They fell out a long time ago.
"Why is he your ""young uncle""?"
- How many do you have?
- Three.
- Are the others older?
- Yes.
Bravo.
Where are they?
"One is in Ahwaz, the other in Kermanshah and I don't know where the third one is."
Don't they visit their mother?
"Yesterday evening, my uncle told my mother that his holidays were over."
But they've fallen out.
How did he tell her?
My uncle speaks to her but my mother doesn't reply.
- The others aren't coming?
- No.
"Yesterday, my uncle told my mother that he has to go back."
He's leaving then?
Yes.
What about us?
I don't know.
I have exams that I have to take.
We need a new set of jerseys for the under-fifteen lads.
They've all grown bigger since the start of the season.
"Here, we'll take a few for Sharon's snapper, will we?"
That's a very good idea.
No!
"Here you go, Georgie."
Here.
There.
"Thanks very much, lads."
That's great.
"Oh, give a little."
Helps a lot.
- Gobshite.
- Absolutely.
Listen...
Do you think she'll get married?
What's that?
"Oh, no."
No.
"Jesus, no."
"They've more cop-on these days, eh?"
"I mean, would you get married... if you were that age again... these days?"
- What?
- I think I'm going to cry.
"Anyway, I wouldn't want Sharon getting married that young."
She's her whole life ahead of her.
Exactly.
Unless she drinks an iffy pint.
Having a baby's the most natural thing in the world.
- That's right!
"- Oh, good shite!"
"Olé, olé, olé, olé"
- I have one ready.
Give him milk when he wakes up.
Try not to excite him.
"Thank you, Doctor."
And now you'd best have a look at this rump.
- You've humiliated me.
- Good.
You'll be too embarrassed to speak of it.
No-one must know what's happened.
"- Gentlemen, do I have your word?"
- Yes.
"And you, monsieur?"
"After all the time we spent together, how could you?"
In cold blood?
It was easy.
You're a menace to the future of art.
Goodbye.
Remember what the doctor said.
Try not to excite him.
- He needs peace.
- I know what he needs.
Go home.
Paint something dead.
- Aurora?
- Yes.
I feel very weak.
- Have I been wounded?
- No.
No.
"On the contrary, you wounded him."
"In his shooting arm, too."
He never even had time to fire.
H i.
Very funny.
So I guess you've heard.
Sharon's dad is okay.
That's great.
"No, I hadn't heard."
I'm obviously the last person in Pittsburgh to hear.
- So you're friends with Sharon now?
"- Well, so, you are, right?"
Look.
"We all know what's going on around here, okay?"
- Which is that you are jealous.
- What?
And you.
You are totally flipped because...
Rayanne finally did something nice for once in her life.
Which she did by taking Sharon to go visit her dad.
And now both of you just want to be sure that you both still are friends.
Which you are.
So shut up!
Let's kill him.
"Say a prayer, Vasquez."
I'm going to kill him.
"- l've been knocking, but..."
- What?
Your mom let me in.
I came to drop off your bag.
- What are you listening to?
- A group you probably hate.
"Okay, I'll go."
I'm glad your dad is going to be okay.
My father almost died.
Faiz is in danger.
They will kill him.
Why are you'll looking at my face?
Go and call for the priest!
Go!
"Where are you, priest?"
How long will you take?
This marriage should happen today.
Talk to the priest later.
"Tell me where my brother is, first."
Did you mortgage him to me?
Listen you prince!
"If something happens to my brother, I shall destroy your world."
Threaten someone else!
Kayyub!
Come on!
Come on!
"Come on, inside!"
Brother we have put the girl in the vehicle.
"Your ""Would be"" bride shall be with us."
"Give me my brother and take away your ""Would be"" bride."
- Come on!
- Away!
Away!
"If something happens to my brother, everyone shall be killed."
"Brother, the girl!"
Sit in the car!
You'll attack us?
Get up!
Get up!
Don't beat!
Shadab!
I need you to come to Emperor Land.
Bring as many of your kind as you can.
BRYAN:
Why?
- To dance.
You know...
[ALL SNICKERING]
"Now, why would I wanna do that?"
- To free the penguin nation.
"- Oh, yeah?"
- There's been a catastrophe.
- Right.
The entire population is trapped.
BRYAN:
Uh-huh.
MUMBLE:
By huge walls of ice and snow.
Hey!
Bryan!
"Look, I'd love to help you, sport, but you've come at the worst possible time."
"Maybe after winter or something, okay?"
"No, that's too late."
Way too late.
Bryan!
You gonna fight or what?
You said you owe me one.
"But right now, I got problems of me own."
"Everyone's cranky, looking for biff."
The multitudes need me to keep the peace.
"If you don't come now, multitudes will die."
Here we go.
You saying it's my fault now?
"I was 20 bucks up, but with only enough time for one more pick-up before the bars closed,"
I needed to make sure I chose a wealthy client.
[ Cellphone rings ]
"""Honda Civic."""
I'll forward that to Rut.
"I wanted a bigger tip, so I held out for another car."
And I'm glad I did.
"Oh, my gosh!"
I don't even want to know that.
Woman #2:
It's crazy.
[ All talking at once ]
No!
"No, no, no."
I can't even begin to guess what they're talking about.
Yeah.
It's a package.
I'm just saying.
"Look, I don't wear toe socks around town."
I am out of my element.
He was weird because I went to his...
"While Rut was off driving a cheap Civic, my last pick-up took me to the Castro district, and I was looking for a big tipper."
Hi.
Did you guys call Zingo?
- We did call Zingo!
- I'm Adam.
"- Ah, Bobby Pin."
- Bobby Pin.
I called 1-800-babe.
Is that you?
"No, but thanks for asking."
- Okay.
No.
You're not wearing pantyhose.
It's hot.
Take them off.
No.
Ridiculous.
I'm so sorry.
"Oh, my god."
Where have you been?
"We just wanted to make sure everything was set up, you know, perfectly at the reception and the dinner, and it's great."
Wow.
You look amazing.
You look like a princess.
What's wrong?
Don't cry.
"It's just, I've dreamed about this day my whole life."
Since my first communion.
Is that weird?
"No, hon."
We've all been dreaming about our own weddings.
Now that I'm here this doesn't feel right.
Everything will work out as it... should.
The future kind of has a funny way of doing that.
You just have to wait and see how it all unfolds.
Deep breath.
Yeah.
Take a deep breath.
Hey.
Wait.
Picture.
No.
No pictures.
I need you to sleep at the loft.
Lily.
Jenny Humphrey.
"Uh, yeah?"
You bitch.
"You told me you were selling me oxy,"
But those pills were antibiotics.
"Yeah, I didn't get high."
I got a yeast infection.
¶...
For an audience of one ¶
¶ ooh ¶
Dad.
"Look, I can explain."
I came here to tell you.
"Jenny, please save your breath."
Like I'm gonna believe a word out of your mouth.
Get your things and come with me.
We're going home...
To Brooklyn.
"¶ ooh, ooh ¶"
What did you want to talk about that couldn't wait?
"The producer from CNN just flew into town,"
And I'm gonna meet her for drinks in 20 minutes.
I want you to take the internship.
"Come on, Dan."
I don't want us to be making decisions based on fear.
All right?
"So whatever happens, we'll figure it out."
Thank you.
"I, uh..."
Got you some stationery
This is your night.
You've worked so hard for this.
That's not what I work for.
"-No, But still."
Sometimes it's good to take a break and enjoy the achievements.
It does not help to look back.
"Here, keep it."
You can get it.
I do not care who you were with.
Just get your ass down here now.
"But Aksel, you should have seen her."
A gorgeous blonde.
Her tits is the size of melons.
-Beina is as long as my dick.
"Fuck you, Degang."
"So, ScanBrazil?"
People all over the earth tremble enough in his pants now.
"Dispose of CDN, Genergy, Oxon and the European branch of Mintec."
Can anyone make some coffee for us?
It's going to be a long night.
Talk Pronovo and Sandelman.
Buy what you can.
"Go, go."
And I need a clean shirt!
Look here.
This is how champagne is opened.
55 million so far.
They supply them now.
I love the smell of bankruptcy in the morning.
"Quiet now, Degang."
-What Tsirk?
-There is Belarus.
and it can lift up to two or three persons.
I can't believe you have to be armed with such things.
Emergency alert!
An armed group of intruders have been spotted at excavation site one.
All defense units and medics are to report immediately!
So they've come.
I'm going to try these babies out right now.
What's going on?
Damn!
He's a monster!
Run for it!
Withdraw!
Why you..!
What happy people!
How dare you act so vulgar!
Spriggan!
Yu Ominae..!
you can't escape!
I leave him to you!
Come back here!
you little traitor?
What?
Major Fatman!
It's a pity Ominae..!
Did you lose your abilities when you joined Arcam?
How come?
How come?
What's wrong with you?
and what we trained you for!
Bastard!
Who the hell are you?
!
Someone]
Whoa!
Nana!
How you doing?
Looking hot in the tracksuit.
Gym's on the second floor.
[J.D.] Date time.
Dude.
There you are.
Two things.
"First, aliens are here wearing tracksuits."
"- Oh, no, that's Nana."
- Second...
I got a job.
- Nice.
"- If you hadn't pushed me to do that extra mile stuff, that wouldn't have happened, so thank you."
You got a hottie waiting for you at the bar.
You go get her!
- Where were we?
- Do I smell banana conditioner?
"That's one of my conditioners, yes."
"[J.D.] As great as this was, I couldn't stop thinking about what Turk said..."
This girl really digs hair.
It's hard getting what happens at the hospital out of your head.
Ah!
How was your first stress-free day?
Horrible.
You?
Worse.
Let's make a baby.
"If it doesn't work this time, I'll kill myself."
Not helping with the stress.
"I said, all right, Horace."
"I called a time out so you can go take a leak, all right?"
"I mean, what am I gonna do?"
"He's my nephew and he's crying, right?"
"So I said, okay, honey, go to the toilet, I'll put Ralphie in right field, all right?"
So you can go take a pee pee.
"And he's crying, just standing there."
"I said, what's the matter with you?"
I thought you had to go make a pee pee?
Now go make a pee pee!
"And he says... (high pitched) Uncle Pete, Uncle Pete, it's too late!"
I look and he's got piss all over his pants!
His pants are covered in piss!
"Remember that, Horace?"
Remember when you peed your pants in little league?
Where you going?
"Oh, come on, you little crybaby!"
"- Don't cry, little Horace."
Horace:
He's all right.
"He's all right, Pa."
man:
"Oh, Jesus."
"- Hey, Horace, didn't your other boy play baseball, too?"
- Yeah.
"Yeah, Little Pete's good."
- Yeah.
"- He's on a team, he's great."
"Shortstop, and he can hit it."
Fantastic.
"- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey."
Where you been?
"Higaki, we're counting on you."
- We are counting on you!
- We are counting on you!
Isn't this what idiots say?
Don't be jabbering around me.
Apologize Higaki.
I can't forgive what you said just now.
"If I lose, I'll kneel on the floor to apologize."
"Higaki, you know what you gotta do?"
The day I lose to that chibi is the day I die.
I'm a pro.
Sixth match.
Hyotei's Higaki against Seigaku's Echizen.
You... are the pillar of Seigaku.
"Ah, you don't have to be so bothered, it's just a tennis game."
"But chibi, it doesn't matter what kind of genius you are, I won't give any chances."
I'm the real genius.
A dog that doesn't bite barks the most.
Hoh!
A kid like you wouldn't know.
"Weak, huh."
Love - 15
- Out!
- 15
- All
30 - 15
That fellow.
40 - 15
Game Seigaku.
One game to love.
Seigaku leading.
"Damn kid, dares to look down on me."
Enough.
"Come on, what the hell has gotten into you the last couple of days?"
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
You think I can't do this by myself?
You think I'm on something?
"- ""On something""?"
- Yeah.
- I never said you were on something.
- Then don't.
Don't start.
"Hey, now we're talkin' here."
She's a killer.
You're goddamn right I'm a killer.
You look like a Holocaust victim in pageant makeup.
"- I will eat your babies, bitch."
- Bring it!
- Nobody's eating babies.
"- Hey, you lookin' to spar, little girl?"
- No.
No fight.
She's not ready.
"- Oh, I'm ready."
"- No, you're not ready."
- I'm ready!
Let me eat her babies.
"- What about next Friday, huh?"
- Yeah.
How's Friday?
- You're crazy.
- How's Friday to you?
"What's the matter, ""Frankie Fat Hands""?"
- You're afraid she's gonna get knocked out just like you did?
- That's good.
That's not what I said though.
- What do you mean?
- When you were... born.
When I was born?
You mean changing diapers and things?
- I did that.
- I know you did.
"Remember, once I went out into the road... and you waited, and you gave me a spanking... for going out in the road?"
- Do you remember?
"- Oh, I remember that one too."
That was a tough -
- And you -
- That was a tough corner.
And you used to take me fishing?
Right?
"Oh, I did."
Every week.
Every week we went fishing and horseback riding.
Remember?
- Do you -
"- Well, I liked doing those things."
- We enjoyed ourselves.
- We did enjoy ourselves.
I'm still livin'.
Yes.
And I'm glad you are.
"- I'm not bad, eh?"
- I think you're great.
You still look pretty handsome to me.
[Chuckles]
- I'm not bad.
"She loved me, you must understand."
"What, you think I don't understand love?"
It's better for the other.
- What's next?
- For what is above.
But you talk to God?
Could you not remain just for two minutes?
It would be sad.
- What isn't?
Open your eyes.
- I don't know how to see.
- But I know inside and I see later ...
- And have I came inside?
Young.
Want to check?
- So I'll be like your bitch!
"- No, you would not do."
And is this what you want?
"You are truly a beautiful asshole, cousin."
It's André.
"André, that's my cousin Leon."
André is a guy who fucks good.
"It is well established by my mother, and I was placed in his lap."
"Marivaux is nice, but side slut, he prefers me."
And once in America that could be done?
Mr. de La Fayette will give the instructions.
Aglaé!
- Aglaé!
- I come!
There is Simon there?
Who has two ...
There are two ...
"No, no, that ain't the woman!"
I ought to know!
"- Curly ought to know, too."
"- You're screwy, Curly."
That's just somebody who looks like her.
"You ain't going to work the boy over, are you?"
"That all depends on you, Joe."
You wanna talk?
"Listen, boy- You're not mine, see?"
"They just think you are, see?"
"So no matter what they do to you, you can take it."
I know that you can.
"Just like your old man, see?"
I don't know what you're talking about!
Let me go home to mother and dads!
"Don't let them throw you, Joey!"
Start him off.
"I think you'll decide to talk, Joe."
"Start walking, Sonny."
- What ?
- Get a move on!
Walk!
Pick them up!
Feet!
Feet!
"All right, my son."
Dad's at breakfast.
"You're not going to sleep all day, are you?"
"Oh, always throwing your things around."
Don't you want to eat breakfast ?
Paul!
Paul!
We're cleared here.
Surveillance had them all going inside 45 minutes ago.
- Did anyone bail out on the perimeter?
"- No, ma'am."
All secure out here.
"Boss, this isn't a meth lab."
So why an escape tunnel?
Need to take a look at this.
Hotchner.
When?
Did they raise the terror alert?
"No, that's probably best."
"All right, get everybody in now."
I'll be there in a minute.
What's going on?
Nothing.
I just have to go to the office.
"It's 6:15, and you're talking about a terror alert?"
"It's bad, isn't it?"
I don't know yet.
Please don't lie to me.
It might be.
I may not be home tonight.
"I mean,"
- I might be home late.
- I know.
Shoot.
I forgot.
Tomorrow is the day we... scheduled to take Jack
- to have his pictures taken.
- Don't worry about it.
- I'll reschedule.
Alex looks nervous.
"Oh, God, I hope I'm doing the right thing."
I think you are.
"Ladies and gentlemen, the party is about to get started."
The dance floor is all yours!
"Okay, girls, lick your lips."
Come in close.
It's good to see ya.
Tell Claire I'm looking for her.
Your husband's a lucky guy.
- Mmm.
- Oh!
- Waiter!
Can we have more dressing?
- We were separated at birth.
"Two more drinks when you get a chance, please."
That would be nice.
This looks delicious.
I'm so happy.
I can't believe he's married.
I can't believe he chose Claire over you.
- I can.
- I told you not to introduce them.
"Well, she already had a husband."
I thought it was safe.
- How are you handling all this?
- I've learned my lesson.
No more fantasies about good-looking men.
You never know.
There's a guy out there somewhere for you.
"Oh, yeah?"
Who?
The new Brain Slave refuses to report!
Ain't nothing but a brain.
"As are we, Son."
And we do our job!
"You right, Daddy."
You right!
"Go on and fetch this Brain Slave, and kindly ask him to be on bug removal!"
Permanently!
"Customer, Daddy!"
Get my blue fright wig at once!
"Greet them with a smile, Son."
A hard plastic smile.
"We got a free dashboard cleaning, get the lint balls off your car, free tire shine!"
You'll get all that with a free brain removal.
Carl Brain:
"Moron, don't tell them!"
I meant to say car wash.
Now gas them!
Quickly!
"Look, I just came by to tell you that I've told the police about your little brain operation here."
"Yeah, and they didn't believe us."
"No, they didn't."
Then we shall call them and show them pictures!
"That's a good idea, Daddy."
It is a very good idea.
Where's Carl's brain?
I am Carl Brain.
"No, Carl's Brain."
I am Carl Brain.
"No, no, no."
"Different carl, okay?"
I am Carl Brain.
I will take this further if you wish.
"- It's over, as far as I'm concerned."
"- Are you sure, Mrs. Coyne?"
"Yes, Captain Dreyfuss, I'm sure."
"Oh, excuse me."
You didn't come back.
"The shore, The Far Rock."
I walk there every day.
"That's how I know, but... you must feel free to walk there."
"The lough, this place, it's for everyone."
"You have a young fella out there, Michael, you might want to..."
You're not welcome here.
Surely to God you know that.
"I just got posted, sir, all right?"
I'm due to depart for England real soon.
I just wanted one last drink with my pal here.
"Michael, let him in."
The lad's off to do his duty.
Go on.
One!
Noches!
"Hey, Noches!"
"Give me a hand to redd up, will you, Barney?"
Noches!
He went home a while ago.
- Mr. Coyne.
- Lieutenant.
"I'm, er, you know, I'm, er,"
"I'm really sorry for what happened, sir."
I-I didn't mean any harm.
"Go home while you're still ahead, son."
Good luck to you.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
"- No, no, no."
That's all right.
Do we have an appointment?
"Actually, I wanted to make one."
It's about next semester.
"Uh, oh..."
Could you come back tomorrow?
After class?
My head is swimming.
It's hot.
Put your head between your legs.
Pretty girl.
Very pretty.
With all that make-up?
"You don't wear any, do you?"
"I'd still look like me, only in color."
You're too smart for that.
"You're a confident, no-nonsense woman."
- I sound like an airline.
"- I'm sorry, I'm probably saying it wrong."
"It's just that you don't need any of that, Rose."
Thanks.
How's your head?
- I think food will help you.
"- Pizza, maybe?"
Where can we go?
Dancing?
Why did I say that?
There's that great dessert place.
All delicious things are fattening.
It was a brand-new cigar.
You stay here.
"If you notice something odd, whistle."
Whistle?
Don't you get it?
I gotta get out of here!
- Shut up!
- I gotta get out!
- Who is that?
That isn't one of our cars!
- Another car!
Someone ratted us out!
- Seems to be the police.
- Police?
"Get out, rat!"
He's not gonna rat us out again.
- He has learned his lesson.
- I told you he's gonna cause trouble!
"What was that, Karl?"
"A big bump, even for such a bad road."
I can't see anything.
- Who is there?
- Just open up!
Took longer than usual.
Where is Franz?
- What is she doing here?
- She even wanted to call the cops.
You caused us a lot of trouble with your man Biberkopf.
- What happened to Franz?
- They snatched him.
Who?
That can't be true!
General Zavros has a point.
"Let's go, professor."
The Treasure of Atlantis awaits.
Lord Cleeve is right.
We cannot afford to have you follow us.
"Oh, MacGyver!"
"Kelly, try to get this rope over your head."
Come on.
Ohhh!
Come on.
Oh!
You okay?
I can't believe Atticus would do that.
Oh.
"His passion, Cleeve's greed."
It makes sense.
I'm sorry.
I know you looked up to him.
Used to.
We did exactly what Cleeve wanted us to.
"Now he and Zavros are going to steal the Treasure of Atlantis, thanks to us."
Maybe not.
Cleeve's estate.
Let's find it.
Kind of looks like they're planning a trip.
We can't let them take off with the artifacts.
I know.
Wait here.
Just look at it.
Unlike anything the world has seen in thousands of years.
It is truly magnificent.
Probably the finest item I'll ever acquire.
He's in a hospital in Miami.
"He had a stroke, but recovered okay."
Your bodyguard is dead.
I asked about Fredo.
I think he got out.
He must be somewhere in New York.
All right.
I want you to get in touch with him.
I know he's scared.
Tell him everything is all right.
Tell him I know Roth misled him.
That he didn't know they would try to kill me.
-They can come in now.
-There was something else.
What?
What?
Come on.
Kay had a miscarriage.
-Was it a boy?
-At three and a half months...
Can't you give me a straight answer?
Was it a boy?
I really don't know.
"Poor little Fredo, he's got pneumonia."
"Young man, I hear you and your friends are stealing goods."
But you don't even send a dress to my house.
No respect!
You know I've got three daughters.
This is my neighborhood.
You and your friends should show me some respect.
You should let me wet my beak a little.
I hear you and your friends cleared $600 each.
"Oh, God!"
Tasik!
- What is it?
"- Maria Vasilyevna, you're wrong!"
- Roll out of here!
- Naturally.
"I have no other choice, but you're wrong."
"Why did you fall, Tasik?"
Now let's be serious.
Please tell Nina that from now on I'll never set my foot in this house!
- We'll survive.
- Naturally.
"But time will tell who's right and, as we know, time is for us!"
"- Step aside, please."
- What?
"- Step aside, please!"
- You're welcome.
Who needs you?
"Well, that's it..."
"Oh, damn it!"
"Shame on you, Maria Vasilyevna, a simple Russian woman."
I think your daughter...
Don't come near me!
I'm standing.
"She won't forgive you that, neither will my daughter."
- Look...
- Don't touch me!
Ciao-miaow!
Let me through!
Hello?
"No, I didn't chase anyone."
Just turned my son-in-law out.
Sex with a minor was all they could get him on.
Why was that?
She wouldn't cooperate.
Said he was a genius and apparently that's what geniuses do.
I wouldn't know what geniuses do.
I'm just a dumb arse cop.
I know nothing about art.
"Sleep well, Mr Greene."
(Door opens)
(Door closes)
I hear you had a big win.
"Oh, for God's sake, Barney."
Alright!
He was a man that I met at the Adelaide conference.
He's English.
And he is now safely back in Devon with his wife and he will never ever come back here.
What's his name?
Does it matter now?
You don't know him and I'm never gonna see him again.
OK!
OK.
John.
Bartrop.
John Bartrop.
There.
You happy now?
Bleeding saints.
Recognise this?
Guido Reni.
In six months the streets would have made him ugly.
He would have died in a crack haze down some lane.
"I gave him that, his moment of absolute perfection."
"I said, it's not mine."
You know anything about a Japanese man living in the village?
You're dripping water all over the place.
Answer me.
Do you know him or not?
Did you meet him?
Answer me.
You're scaring her.
Get out for a sec.
"Come on, this is serious."
It's you and me.
Daddy is a policeman.
I'll know if you lie.
Did you meet this man?
Tell me.
Tell you what?
Everything.
"Where you met, what you did."
Why should I tell you?
Because it's important.
What's so important?
"Answer me, girl!"
"I said, what's so important?"
What's so damn important?
What the hell... is so damned important?
You don't even know what's important.
"Stop grilling me, goddamn it!"
Fuck!
What are you doing?
I thought you were sleeping.
What the hell?
Yanking up your daughter's skirt in the middle of the night?
Whose idea was it to run him off without a wedding?
Shut up!
"Look out, sire!"

"- Hey, Ponch."
Wake up.
- Why?
What are you doing?
Clocking a sparrow?
She's beautiful.
"Tall, tan, legs up to here."
You better keep your eyes on the car in front of you.
She wears these short shorts and little flip-flops.
And she's even got sexy feet.
Feet?
- How long you known her?
- She just moved into the trailer park.
I haven't met her yet.
Did you see what almost happened to me?
"It was only almost, Ponch."
I'm gonna give that bozo a piece of my mind.
And maybe more.
"What's wrong, officer?"
I was only going 45.
Maybe 50.
Okay.
"It's possible that I was going over a little more, but it's..."
- But...
"- Hey, mister."
"- When you're on the freeway, you..."
"- Hey, Ponch, the traffic, okay?"
It's simple.
"This is our home, and this is my grandmother."
How do you do?
-You're all right?
Need a doctor?
"-No, thank you, I feel fine."
All right.
"Then, go home!"
"In a minute, Grandma, as soon as he's had his coffee."
How does it look?
What would Marco say?
Mark would say he should go home as soon as he's had his coffee.
I'm sorry.
-Who's Mark?
-My fella.
He's coming home from Europe tomorrow.
"I mean, today."
"Rosa, why did you do this?"
Why did you bring me here?
What was your first idea on it?
That I thought you were pretty?
It looked as if they were gonna turn you into tomorrow's headlines.
I thought it might be messy for your wife.
It was awfully nice of you.
Shame on you!
It's 4:00 in the morning.
4:00!
I have to attend a meeting at 10:00.
"I'm supposed to be as sharp as a tack, and as clear as a bell."
But you're not worried about what Mrs. Bourne will say.
-Mrs.
Bourne will be very understanding.
- She's messing with you.
- Ha-ha-ha.
I kept texting her telling her you insisted we bring something.
- Where is Daddy?
"- He'll be here, a few minutes."
"Which reminds me, I should finish dinner, huh?"
"Luke, would you take our bags up to my room?"
"It's the first one on the left, the one with the Hello Kitty poster."
Allison.
We sleep together.
I'm not gonna be a hypocrite.
"No, no, of course not."
I didn't raise you that way.
It's sweet that you care what I think.
Come on.
"So, what do you think?"
- I think he's really nice.
"- I know, right?"
And cute too?
He's adorable.
"Oh, honey, hand me the meat thermometer, would you?"
I have not made a roast chicken in I can't remember how long.
This thing does not look done.
- This is not...
- Is she here?
"Oh, at 150 at least, don't you think?"
Mom.
When?
Heh.
Tonight.
Are you freaking kidding me?
Tonight?
Ah-ha!
Just the man I'm looking for.
Wow.
"Look, a spot just opened up in the lawn dart game"
- In the park.
"- Oh, that is great news!"
"Is what I would say if I could go, but I can't."
What?
"No, we've been waiting for months for this spot!"
You don't think I know that?
I'm the one that put us on that waiting list.
But I can't go because
I've got to wait here for the police to come and arrest me.
Right...
"Well, good luck with that, Baberella."
"Oh, do you want to be on the visitor's list"
In the unlikely event they allow me one?
"- No, I'll just wait for you on the outside."
- OK.
No.
[ Baber sighs. ]
- Hello!
- Oh!
"Hi, sweetie!"
Hi!
Oh!
Uh-oh!
"Cooking turkey bacon again, the gateway meat."
"Well now, some would call it the gateway to heaven!"
"Not Muslims of course, just people who like bacon."
Are you OK?
You seem a little tense.
Thank you.
Vinnie sure likes strange places.
It looks like Monday night in Key Largo.
He's impersonating Mafia.
Vinnie Zapatti's a joke to his uncle but a dangerous joke.
"As far as I'm concerned, they're all dangerous jokes."
Do me a favor and don't write them off just yet.
I said they were dangerous.
Wonder what Vinnie's doing in a place like this?
Wonder what we're doing in a place like this.
- This is it.
- Where's our boy?
- I don't know.
- Think Vinnie had a change of heart?
"If he's a Zapatti, he has no heart."
- Let's go.
- Don't turn around.
"Marybeth, right?"
Who's this?
He's the deputy mayor.
Deputy mayor?
"What do I need you for, then?"
Don't get smart.
I'm the only chance you got.
All right.
Let's go.
This a Searider?
"What, you know boats?"
I worked on a shrimper like this.
This ain't no Searider.
It's a piece of shit.
They call it a Surfrider.
"Uh, with your mom and a six-pack?"
You don't really help the situation.
You could at least try to be nice.
"Oh, I'm sorry."
It's hard for me to show kindness to people that hate me.
I'm not that evolved.
So a movie tonight?
Whatever you wanna do is fine by me.
- But I'm late and I gotta go.
- Okay.
All right.
And the keypad is for texting which is what you do when you want to avoid talking to someone.
"Anna, it's Jeremy."
Uh...
- I haven't heard from you in a while.
"- Ha, ha."
- Okay.
"- I didn't break it, I swear."
I was showing Harper what you taught me.
Marvelous device.
- Who was that?
- Jeremy Gilbert.
- Is that your boyfriend?
- Of course not.
- What do you think?
- Very respectable.
That's the goal.
I can't say that I miss corsets.
Susie Sunshine gave me her car keys.
And her ATM card.
- What's that?
- I'll explain later.
Wow!
It's so pretty!
Now you're becoming a great barista.
Right?
Unnie.
Your dad passing away must be really hard.
Your dark eye circles are going down to your chin.
Huh?
Cover it up a little before you head out the door.
Hello!
Da Hye!
Na Na unni!
You came.
Did you finish the things for your dad well?
Ah... well.
It turned out like that!
We are getting married!
Didn't I say you guys suit each other well!
Congratulations!
Thank you!
Na Na unni quit...
and Lee Yoon Sung's not there either.
The Blue House has become so tense...
"Well, but you said as long as you have me you'll always be happy."
Ah that's why marriage...
it's a really important decision.
Take it back!
"Take it back, unni!"
Da Hye!
"If you guys are busy and can't come, I can send you guys my bank account number."
You can put the wedding money in there!
"Be happy, Eun Ah."
You got it?
- Yeah.
- Good.
Slowly.
Everything like I told you.
"Get out, and open my door, now."
Out.
"Andy, he's inside."
We ain't letting you out of here till you give us something.
"Hey, Paul."
What you got?
"Vagrancy and, uh, resisting arrest."
That's not a good way to start the day.
Come on.
Do I get my phone call?
What's going on?
Vernon.
"That domestic you rolled last week, the one with the broken collarbone?"
- What about him?
- Ia is all over it.
They want a statement from you on tape.
After we process this guy.
Bates can take care of it.
"I want this cleared up now, in my office."
Let's go.
Are you deaf?
Come on.
You watch yourselves with this one.
Process him then get back here.
"Okay, feeding in the loops."
Move.
Open it.
Maureen!
Maureen!
Them fish look like mama after she takes her arm vitamins.
"Maureen, get off the goddamn ice!"
You're gonna fall through!
You forgot your pussy!
No!
"Daddy, water!"
"Daddy, water!"
"It's okay, buddy, it's okay."
"Only your butt got wet, what the fuck is wrong with you?"
"He almost drowned as a baby, you heartless whore!"
I did?
"Daddy, Billy kicked me in the eye a little."
Jesus Christ!
"- Daddy, water!"
"Daddy, water!"
- Frank?
"Sue, start the car, we're going to the hospital!"
You're grounded!
Out of my way!
My daughter's bleeding to death!
"Wait for me, Mommy!"
"All right, my daughter needs a doctor right away!"
"Listen, take a seat, fill this out and we'll get to you as soon as we can."
"Oh, no."
"No, no, no, no!"
I don't fill things out.
You fill things out.
She needs a doctor.
"Yeah, how about she waits like the rest of us?"
How about I take the brake off that thing and send you right out into the snow?
Let's just clear some of this.
I'm on pine cone duty.
"To be fair, when we make tents I'm normally the one who just pretends to be busy the whole time."
"Oh, it's good..."
-...that the instructions are in Swedish.
"-Don't need instructions, Liam."
-Here we go.
This is the one we need.
"-Yeah, this is the floor."
What?
You put it through the things or this?
-What you do with this?
"-And this bit goes on there, I think."
Stick the-
- clip the little siIver--
I think we've done the wrong one.
"Looking good, lads."
Because then the other bit goes over the top of it.
"-No, you have to--"
-This is not going very well.
That little hole.
"Oh, there we go."
I've smashed it.
Liam's nearly clocked it in about five minutes.
Has anybody got a hammer?
Where are you making the fire?
Here.
"Oh, thanks, lads."
Yeah.
Cheers.
You're not doing a tepee fire?
"Listen, forget what they taught you in Scouts."
"No, I've been trying to find a way for Scott to feed without killing ever since Mexico."
This could be his second chance.
What about those kids he killed?
Do they get a second chance?
[Carlos] Give me the goddamn bonds!
[pounding]
Come on!
"I'm coming, my little piggies!"
And I'm gonna make myself some chicharron de rinche!
Let's go!
"Go get 'em, cabrón!"
[sniffs]
[sniffs]
[Scott] Kate!
Get back here!
"They're too weak and hungry, they can't follow us."
Come on!
Stop!
What are you doin'?
Give me the bonds.
You're not gonna shoot.
"Look, I know it's hard to let family go."
"Just give me the bonds, or I swear to God the next one goes in your kneecap."
"Now, cuff yourself to the truck and throw me the keys."
Do it.
- You're making a huge mistake.
- No.
I am making up for one.
[slurping]
"[cracking sound] [grunts, gasps]"
Scott?
Scott.
So you two were in the room then?
Were you sleeping together?
- Did he tell you he slept with me?
"- No, I'm just asking."
What did you do then?
I don't talk about that kind of stuff.
I see.
But how did you get out when I was outside the door?
Ask him yourself.
Did you two by any chance walk over me?
We came out anyway.
So you walked over me?
Why is that so important?
We got out and that's it.
"You're mean, Sunhee."
Two women shouldn't be fighting dirty over a man.
The choice should be the woman's.
This is so boring.
This is why hell is so boring!
Don't get mad.
I'm fine.
So you really are just a woman.
The phone has been turned off.
You'll be connected to...
Moonsook.
Where the hell are you?
Moonsook.
"Lizard, lizard"
Can do anything
"Lizard, lizard"
Can do anything
Finished.
", When he first came here he had a smile."
Just like a shining apple.
Now he's worn out because he can't sleep.
Experienced sushi chef wanted at the end of this month...
RED PORNO
RED PORNO
"Can you alter these, make them a bit longer?"
Certainly.
Would this be long enough?
"Welcome to our store, Please watch your step,"
I'm really sorry.
"Oh, sorry."
Are you alright?
Yes.
How about tonight?
Uh...
Dinner.
It's a Greek restaurant.
You'll love it there.
But...
Can you wait for me at that cafe on the corner when you finish work?
I have to go home now.
"Of course, don't worry."
Are you alright?
I'm fine.
I'm only a bit drunk.
Are you alright?
You were so drunk.
Did I...?
Why don't you take a shower to freshen up?
Where is it?
"Come over here, princess?"
Good!
Yan.
"Yes, Send this picture to Ho Sai at once."
I want him to meet Foon in court.
"Master, why do you draw such pervertible picture?"
Do you feel happy?
"Brother Lone, we all count on you."
Please go ahead.
The witness must be bribed or threatened.
An eye for an eye!
I want to threaten them too.
Please find them out.
"And then torture them, make them confess."
Good idea.
How can you figure this idea out?
I...
I use my brain.
Don't worry.
Count on me.
"It's alright, count on me."
"Don't worry, count on me."
Brother Lone doesn't seems to be alright
"Your Honour, I would like to summon a new witness."
What big deal?
Your old man!
"Objection, how dare he scold my old man?"
"Come on, don't always object, can you listen his words first?"
Summon Sir Ho Sai.
I mean your dad!
This is my master.
Chan Mon-gut.
"Sir, thank you for your help."
You shouldn't play with people's feelings.
Is that real what you do on the phone?
Isn't it just another game?
"We're just mammals, too."
Sure...
It's good exercise and it pays well.
Do you think we could live like this on a nurse's salary?
"Phone sex is hygienic, impersonal and funny."
There's food in the kitchen.
Hello?
I love your voice.
What's your name?
Jes...
Mr. Yes.
- You'll never be lonely again.
Lusty Terhi will help you.
What's wrong?
"Fine, Mr. Yes."
You want to listen?
You're on top of me.
I can feel something hard against my stomach.
Kiss me all over...
I'm taking your ah...
Isn't this great?
"Are you still there, Mr. Yes?"
"I'd like to - love, for real."
Me too.
Time to go home.
Tired?
"No, this is fun."
You're a strange Finn.
They're usually as lazy as monkeys.
What did you take?
What did you take?
No.
Aah!
No!
"How are your wrists, hon?"
I'm sorry they restrained you.
Lucy.
You've had another schizophrenic episode.
But we're gonna work on making you well.
"Lucy, why don't you introduce yourself to the group?"
"Hi, I'm Lucy."
I...
Obviously.
I go to law school.
- I went to law school.
- She's a schizo.
I saw them bring her in all strapped down and screaming.
Great.
"What'd you do, bite a cop?"
Bruce.
Okay.
"As if our party wasn't full enough with Chuckles, Forgetful, and Her Majesty here, now we add Schizo to the mix."
"Well, this isn't Club Med, so I doubt you're here for a tan."
"No, I, uh..."
I tried to:
Because I went off my meds.
Me too.
"Lucy, what do you think led you to make that decision?"
Um...
I wanted to prove to you that you were wrong.
Wrong about what?
Now listen.
The three of us are gonna work this out.
Yeah?
How?
"First things first, you're gonna put a dollar in my pocket, both of you."
You want attorney-client privilege?
So that everything you say is strictly between us.
I mean it!
Put a dollar in my pocket.
"Come on, make it official."
"Come on, do it!"
That's it.
Come on.
Just a dollar.
"All right, now you, ski bum."
Come on.
Give with the dollar.
- Go on.
- Be smart.
What?
- All I got's a 5.
- I'll take a 5!
"Come on, already."
Come on.
Be cool.
You're now both officially represented by Saul Goodman and Associates.
"Your secrets are safe with me under threat of disbarment, all right?"
Take the ski mask off.
I feel like I'm talking to the Weather Underground.
Just do it.
So if a prison shanking is completely off the table... and we're sure of that?
No shanking!
"Son, I got a man outside with a bullet in his leg."
Do you want to help me with him?
"I'm not outside, friend."
I'm right behind you.
"That's a safe place to be, if you're not a liar."
Have any water?
No.
"No, I don't."
"We're some thirsty, ma'am."
If you could just spare us a half a cup apiece.
We got less than a gallon.
It's for the boy.
Tommy.
Mmm.
"Oh, that sure is good, ma'am."
Haven't you got any manners?
"Excuse me, ma'am."
"It's miss, not ma'am."
"Where's your family, menfolk?"
"Well, yesterday, some men..."
Tommy!
They dead?
"They're away, that's all."
The storm's keeping 'em away.
And the Apaches?
"No, the Mongoles and the Chiricahuas water here."
We live at peace with them.
Oh?
"You live at peace with the marauders, too?"
"- They water here, too?"
- Not until you drank.
You better get off that leg.
Suspect is armed and dangerous.
- Send backup.
- All units respond.
Hold it steady.
My God!
"Yep, it's definitely a rug!"
"Way to go, Hardy, you asshole!"
"Tommy, congratulations."
We're all very proud of you.
You blew up a litter bug's car and found a carpet.
- It looked like a body.
- Then you're in the wrong job.
Let's just say that it was the killer and it was a cop.
It'd be very easy for him to figure out our patrol patterns.
He'd just be waiting for us to come along.
He dumps the rug to make us look like morons.
- Hardy...
- Yes.
- You should know something...
- Are you really a man?
- No.
- Good.
But I was married to one.
- A cop?
- Worse.
A lawyer.
That is worse.
We have a daughter.
She's four.
- What's her name?
- Sarah.
Nice name.
"- Huh, that's sweet."
"It's pathetic, but sweet."
"- Yeah, that's my niche... pathetic and sweet."
Hmm.
What?
No.
Mom!
"I don't know, maybe."
"Okay, I love you, too."
And say hi to Daddy.
What?
How old are you?
- Seventeen.
- What?
!
Really?
You don't go to school?
I used to.
I got kicked out.
"Of Corona, Matre Day, and even Newport Union."
"After that, my parents had enough, said, ""Go away, get a job, move out,"" which I did."
"I got my own studio on the numbered streets, and I work here, and I've never been happier."
- Yeah?
This is you happy?
"- Look, you barely earned these, but..."
"Hey, right on."
Thanks.
Ah!
"All right, Summer's going to be very stoked."
On-on the band.
"I hear they're really good live,and I think the best thing for our friendship, is like, a good, live, band."
"As a girl, I feel I should probably warn you, that this whole little game you're planning, she's gonna see right through it."
[Feigns laugh]
"It's gonna be a ""Day in the Life of a Chicago Firefighter"" sort of thing."
"We have a slow day, and you're just gonna reinforce the stereotype that all we do is sit around and eat."
"You got a problem with it, lieutenant?"
Go for it.
Drug tester's on his way.
"And again, this is mandatory."
"Hey, chief, there's a kid outside looking for you."
Thanks.
Good.
You came on by.
You said it was cool.
"It is, it is."
What's your name?
- Ernie.
- Ernie?
Chief Boden.
"You hungry, Ernie?"
"Hey, everybody."
This here is Ernie.
He's gonna be eating some turkey with us.
"- What's up, Ernie?"
"- Hey, Ernie."
"Hey, I need a sous chef, chief."
"Get over here, little man, we got a turkey dinner to prepare."
- Go ahead.
- Come on.
"First thing we gotta do, taste this gravy."
Tell me what you think.
- Good.
- It's good.
Where'd you find that mutt?

No.
"Oh, please, no."
So what's going on?
"All right, so there's this girl here tonight"
- that I really like.
- Same with me.
"Oh, that's great!"
Perfect wingman situation.
"Two bros, two babes--"
"Yeah, it's the same girl."
"Ohh, that is less great."
Her name's Kim.
She's new at our school.
"I'm really into her, so I asked Pete to go talk to her"
- and find out her situation.
- So I did.
"I went up and asked her if she had a boyfriend, and she said, ""I do now,"" and then she winked at me."
- Traitor!
- I didn't mean for it to happen.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, guys."
"No need to let a girl get in between two best friends, especially when there's an obvious answer."
Very obvious.
- This one goes to Pete.
- Shooting.
Wait!
Wait.
She's pregnant.
- What?
- Looks like about 11 weeks.
Fetal heart rate is 140.
Baby appears healthy and intact.
I need Ricky.
"It's my arm, man."
It hurts like a...
Do something already!
BP's steady at 120.
But he's been like this the whole time.
"Ricky, you need to calm down."
- Did you give him anything?
- Wouldn't hold still long enough.
Good breath sounds.
"Full trauma panel, chest and AP pelvis."
He's a regular customer.
Through and through to the right triceps.
You were lucky.
Yeah?
You should see the other guys.
No fracture or deformity.
"So, what?"
Just go back and forth shooting each other till all of you are dead?
"- An eye for an eye, man."
- Yeah.
Meanwhile his girl gets shot.
- They got Alma too?
- She was hit in the neck and it's pretty serious.
What?
You know who that is?
You may have met Ted and Alma.
- Ted is still -
"- Oh, I know them."
You know them?
Ted is still volunteering up on the palliative care.
- I knew them very well.
- Yes.
Okay?
So you know some of these people?
Um -
This is the original deed... for the house down on Cecil Street... in 1918.
"It was found recently, and we've had it framed to go with the photographs."
Okay?
That's where Baycrest came from - a house all those years ago.
- And my husband's somewhere here too.
- Yep.
Yeah.
Isn't that great?
This is the auditorium.
- And -
- That should be him.
I should remember this.
[Chattering]
And this is the gift that Al gave us.
He gave us all these photographs that you see here.
All the way down the walls.
Look.
But you come and have a look here.
"- Now - - [Ida] Oh, for goodness' sake."
How do ya like that one?
What the...?
..
Murder Squad...
"What are you bringing in here, you guys?"
!
This is crazy!
Successville.
"She's just a bit delusional, I'm so sorry."
"Sit down there, Elsie."
There you go.
"We're cops, Goddamn it, Cyrus!"
You're cops?
Yeah.
Why didn't you say you were cops?
What's this shit about?
You've made an enemy of one of the most powerful men in Successville.
How did I make an enemy?
"Work my arms, Dermot."
How did she make an enemy...?
"Both of them, Dermot."
What did I do?
I just...
What did you do?
"Yeah, what..."
You made me mad!
"You know what, you're crazy."
"You're dressed as an old lady, you have two pairs of glasses on and you've got a head scarf on."
"Screw you, buddy, I'm just a nice old person trying to help people!"
Really?
Yeah.
"How did you try and help Simon Cowell, when you pulled past his office the other night?"
You know what I did?
Splendid.
- Your time's running out.
"- Uh, I think it was closer to the waterfall."
"You see, I buried it at night, and I..."
Find it!
Yes.
- Roger!
- Babs.!
Why didn't you tell me?
I couldn't.
It was too dangerous.
You might get hurt.
Oh.
Terrific idea.
"Now, look, you better find it or..."
You buried the money here?
A year ago.
Only everything's changed so much I haven't been able to find it.
"I'm not a thief, Babs."
Well...
Really I'm not.
It was just so tempting.
But I decided to turn it in for the reward money.
Only I had to find it first.
And today's the only day I could get in here without making everyone suspicious.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Even if you wanted to keep the money and be a thief.
Just tell me you wanted to marry me.
Of course.
Didn't you get my proposal?
The postcard.
But please don't be sad.
It isn't your fault.
"Hey everyone at my funeral, you don't have to be sad."
Death is natural.
Just...feel a little bad.
I won't get to see Je's baby's face.
Kai
I won't get to play badminton with you anymore.
It was really fun that night.
Shit!
"In the end, I forgot to retouch the photo for mom."
Doc
I didn't get to tell you about the beach.
"Actually, I wanted to say sorry about the other day."
And...
"I wanted to talk to you again, even as just a friend."
Shit!
Actually I'm missing out on a lot.
So the doctor told you not to die.
Body.
I am sorry.
I surrender.
"But you won't forgive me, right?"
Goodbye everyone.
Is this the last thing I see in this life?
It isn't even beautiful.
Hello Peng.
Hey you.
Don't call me a douchebag.
But your job isn't finished.
Just a little more.
I asked Lisa to send one day late.
Have you ever seen him in our apartment before?
No.
It's not fucking normal.
Did you tell him about the camera?
No.
- Were you planning on it?
"- No, never!"
Then what the fuck is he doing in the apartment?
I said I don't know!
"Okay, is he dangerous?"
"Well, he takes bets from shady assholes like me."
"So, yeah, he's dangerous."
But...
I don't see Marcus here.
That's his goon.
"If I were in trouble, he'd be in this photo."
"Well, what if he's sitting over here?"
Out of view?
(CHEWING)
"I was up early this morning, and I heard him moving around in his room."
He came out about an hour ago.
Hasn't said a word.
"I don't know what those red pills are, but he's taken at least two of them already."
(SIGHS) Can you guys shut up for a sec?
(DIALS)
(BEEPS)
MAN:
Yeah?
"Hey, Ivan, it's Jasper."
I know.
How's it going?
What?
- Yes.
- Go!
- OK!
- Spend a good night?
-Yes.
"I bought a good one, boyo!"
"- What's up, Felix?"
"- Nothing, pal!"
- Did you make move?
- I'm on Gemma.
"Want a teammate, anything wrong?"
That's not true as you said.
The set is definitely not gold.
No matter how much we might want him to.
It's just a matter of confidence.
And this is an area that I maybe help you out.
"My side, honey."
"Come on, I'm so excited."
Anyway you like!
"Hi, Gemma."
"- Hello, Felix."
- Can we talk?
Okay.
"I mean, obviously, you are my league, but I thought it out just because it worths me."
As what?
If you would like to go out with me sometime.
Something like a coffee or a film.
Sit.
Paul?
I do not think of you in the same way as you expect.
But I'm sure there's someone else helps it out.
You just have to be brave and keep looking.
- What's the matter?
"- You know, Frank."
You look terrible.
You should take a vacation.
I don't want a vacation.
"I got 18 years in, you know?"
I save up my time.
I put in my hours.
I'm eligible for pension in 6 months.
I don't want any vacation.
So what is it?
Get the deputy mayor off my ass.
"""Shrimpboats""?"
Him.
Yeah.
You couldn't handle him?
It was easy.
That's what I'm saying.
It was too easy.
Don't throw bouquets at me
Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much
People will say we're in love
What was that?
Milton and I are great Rodgers and Hammerstein fans.

"No, Mayor."
I don't care if he is from New York.
Who are you?
I'm me.
And what are you not?
A sheep.
Right.
And what does a sheep go?
Marcus?
I love you.
Look.
"I love you, too."
"""I love you, Marcus!"""
Love you!
Look at him!
"While I couldn't accept the offer to become their child's godfather I did allow them to set me up with Angie, a rather beautiful coworker of Christine's."
"They had, however, being them, neglected to tell me one thing."
There's something you don't know about me.
Yeah?
Something exciting?
"I think so, yes."
I have a 3-year-old boy.
"I wanted to throw the napkin on the floor, push over the table and run."
Brilliant.
I love kids.
Yeah.
I like messing about with them.
Doing kid things.
I'd have been disappointed if you didn't have a child.
Why do you say that?
God knows.
Mainly because it sounded smooth and winning.
Because I love kids so much.
They're so lovely.
And he got 'em all!
- You want another one?
- Not another banana joke.
Can I take one of you?
"- So, you pull the thing back?"
"- Oh, it looks nice, yeah."
- Did it click?
- Yeah.
Smile a little.
I don't feel like smiling.
- Focus up there.
You all right?

'Ey up!
It's Noddy!
Good morning.
What can we do for you?
That's what a person my age should be dressed like!
Not like this!
Call that dressed?
I put more than that on to go to bed in!
"Can we help you in any way, or is it t--too late?"
"Razor--sharp responses, you'll notice."
"Still, we shouldn't mock the afflicted."
Pity about his eyesight.
There's nothing the matter with his eyes!
He's wearing shades 'cause he's cool.
I should think he is cool!
His shirt's open to the kneecaps!
"We're over here, sir!"
He's Mutt and Jeff and all!
-
"- Here we are, sir."

- Get off!

"- Watch it, creeping up on people!"

We don't have to make the same mistakes!
We can learn!
"We're not niggas, granddad!"
"If I let you live, you are going to leave me alone, and if I see you again, I'm gonna..."

But what about the fight tour?

"Yeah, you know, this didn't really go as expected."
"When you were the one getting beaten, Robert, it was fun!"
Deal's off!
Will you please go fuck with somebody else?

"Sure, Robert."
All you had to was ask.
I don't even know you.
I'm just the clone.
That's it.
I think it's finally over.
Let's go home.
"Hey, hey!"
One of you niggas call me an ambulance!
"Hey, Robert!"
"What y'all eating, Robert?"

"How come you never invite ya boy Stinkmeaner over for dinner, Robert?"

"That's fucked up, you selfish-ass, hungry-ass nigga!"
"Yo, so, you mean, like,"
Yeah.
Kind of.
I gotta go.
You're looking for something.
I'm not enough!
Am I enough for you?
Are you running for president?
"Yes I am, Ms. Walker."
"Dad, he had another kid."
With Holly.
- Does Mom know about this?
- No!
"And Kevin, she never will."
- You told your sister about us?
- That we're friends.
- It's fine.
Don't worry.
- We got to be careful.
Prodigal daughter returns.
Thought it'd be a nice surprise.
"Oh, my God."
Hey.
Do you know what this editorial is about?
That one reason Whitmore's candidacy is a stretch is because his daughter's too fat to be first daughter.
She's 13.
You're right.
That's awful.
"I mean, my children are going through a divorce."
They need time.
They don't need to be judged by the national media or anyone.
And not to mention...
"Oh, no."
"Oh, right, yeah."
Them the ones with the pointy houses?
"Pyramids, yeah."
"Please, guys, you can call me Rambo."
"I said Rambo could join us for dinner tonight, eh, Grumio?"
"Fine, yeah."
There is no dinner.
Right.
First-class slaving.
It's cool.
I've got my dad's charge card for the Emporium if you wanna run and grab some stuff.
Wicked.
"I mean, I'd rather not run but..."
"So take the sedan, if you like."
Yeah.
I do like.
Excuse me.
"No, no, no, not you again."
Shoo!
Hop it.
I will not allow you to ravage our luxury foods.
"How about I buy 'em, then?"
Ptolemy Hachmenenet?
"Is the name of my master, yes."
He sent me to fetch his scran.
"And I am absolutely delighted you chose us, sir."
Pray tell what your master is craving and I will do my utmost to help.
I thought you might.
"Well, he mainly likes meat."
Lovely.
Shall I fetch a basket?
"Get a trolley, I would."
I don't have time for his crap.

"Leave it, just go to sleep."
"I'll clean up, okay?"
"Mom, what did you do?"
What are you all dressed up for?
"Get down from there, it's dangerous."
From where?
What are you talking about?
"Doborobon, don't ask me and I won't ask you."
O-bo-kay-bay?
(Okay?

No-bo.
At least give me a hint-.
You're not 5 years old any more.
- Was that a hint?
- Was that a hint?
- Are you repeating what I say?
- Are you repeating what I say?
Do you know what this is?
"Oh, thank goodness."
I had the strangest dream.
I dreamt I was addicted to energy pills.
Hmm.
I seem to have been accidentally tied to the bed.
We had to protect you from yourself.
Your dream was real.
Was it?
"Hey, give me my pills out of my jacket."
You're not having any pills.
You're an addict!
"Donna, I'm not an addict."
"Now, if you wouldn't mind reaching into my anus and fetching me my private reserve."
"Ain't happening, Brown."
We're having an intervention.
Yeah?
You and what army of family and nosy neighbors?

Us.
Oh.

"See, Reinhold is a decent guy afterall."
It was probably just a wrong impression.
"- You just go there, I'll join you later."
- Allright.
Goodbye!
- Where are we going?
- Pankow.
We'll pick up another two guys there.
Then we'll do our job.
"No, I can't do that."
Cilly is waiting for me.

- She's gonna be so mad.
Henschke!

"- No, they all drove away."
And Biberkopf?

Why are you upset?
"They just wanted to celebrate, nothing wrong with that."

I just hope Franz isn't gonna screw this up.
"Relax, he just needs a kick in the ass."

- Get out!
- Couldn't they have waited a few more minutes.
Put the cigar away!
- Why?
- Because I say so!
OK.
- OK.
Thanks.
- I hope I get to meet him soon.
- What?
Your boyfriend.
"If you want to keep things private, you got to avoid Noreen."
Yeah.
Thanks.
Thanks for the intel.
I was surprised to hear you were in a relationship.
I just would've assumed you'd say something.
- You're...
You're fishing.
- You're evading.
It's only fair.
You know all the details in my personal life.
"Besides, what's the big secret?"
Is he bald?
A hunchback?
A member of the Green Party?
He doesn't exist.
I don't have a boyfriend.
I lied because I...
"Well, I had to because everybody in this office thinks that you and I are..."
- They do?
- They do.
- But we're not.
- I'm aware of that.
"Every time I tried to tell Noreen, she thought I was lying..."
So you made up another lie.
You'd make a very effective politician.
Maybe because of this.
"Oh, my God."
Do you think -- I do.
What are we going to do?
Relax.
I'll take care of it.
Just get rid of the evidence.

"Okay, I'm no health nut, but that... is just wrong."
"All right, talk."
This isn't what you think.
I'm not a killer.
"Well, then, what are you?"
I'm a Pishtaco.
A fish taco?
A Pishtaco.
"It means ""Peruvian fat sucker""."
Never heard of it.
"So, what, you're like vamps with a sweet tooth for cellulite?"
Vampires kill.
We're just...
Parasites.
"Oh, well, in that case --"
"Look, I would never hurt anybody!"
"Okay, this -- this is why Larry and I started Canyon Valley."

That wasn't me.
"Well, then who was it?"
Alonso.

Tomorrow?
"Tomorrow, can I sleep in your basement?"
Can you drop me at the office?
All my stuff is there.
Because that's where you're sleeping?
Yeah.
And I've got some business that I have to take care of in the morning.

"About you and I, this connection."
Yeah.
Hi.
"Oh, is Sophie asleep?"
-It's like 12:30.
Yeah.
"- Dr. Storper was right,"
- I don't have a fear of flying.

"He thought it was a symptom, but not the cause."
"He didn't know what the cause was, but I know now."
- Ok?
- I have a fear of losing you...
I have a fear of losing you.
Here.
Thanks.
"See, the flying triggered a panic reaction because it was taking me away from you."
The real life stuff has been taking me away from you.
We talked about this.
We did that on purpose.
I wanna be with you and Sophie.
I wanna help you with her.
"I wanna live here, marry you even, if you're into that."
You intend to go to your brother with that?
"Not only go there, but also find out what he has against you."
The number you dialled is not in service.
Come in.
Hello.
Hello.
Is Judge Roban here?
Not yet.
Can I take a message?
Tell him it's all in here.
Very well.
Goodbye.
"Hello, is... is Julie here, please?"
"No, there's no Julie here."
"Yes, Julie... a girl with dark hair."
I don't know.
You must have the wrong floor.

I can even tell you that the glasses are behind...
"Listen, it's not here, OK?"
"Marianne, did Mrs Courcelles get in touch?"
"Not that I know of, Your Honour."
I should have let her leave in her bra and panties.

- I'm leaving.
- I am sorry.
She...
"She stopped by earlier, she left... an envelope for you."
- An envelope?
An envelope.
I can't recall where I put it.
Are you doing this on purpose?
You are biting off more than you can chew.

- We didn't kill your sister.

"Trust me, we're friends!"
I ain't your friend!
I'm your enemy!
Yes!
Use full strength!
Stop talking!
Fight!
Go!
"Ming-kai, use 8-divine Sword."
"Wu-tang, why didn't you use full force?"
How did you know?
Go on!
Why did you intentionally miss him?
How did you know I missed him?
Chin Kang Fist?
8-divine Sword?
Yes!
You better not play any tricks!
We won't.
"It's just a contest, so there's no need to kill each other."
Nonsense!
What do you mean?
Mean?
Chin Kang Fist and 8-divine sword are both impressive.
I can't distinguish which is better.
That's why I invited you both here.
I want to know which is better.
"So it's either B-ball with tall, dark and uptight here, or nothing."

"Okay, since, uh, you're a guest in my house, you take it in."
I got a tip.
"So you know, the other guy putting the ball in the hoop is bad."
"Danno, shut up."
"Please, don't call me Danno, huh?"
"- Yo, How long you two been married?"
"- Come on, play ball."
"Okay, all right."
Time out.
Time out.
"All right, time."
"Ahem, you, uh, never played basketball, have you?"
"- No, I've played once or twice."
- Yeah?
I could see that.
"It looked like I was watching LeBron, maybe he's just this much better:"
"- Football was my sport, okay?"

"Oh, yeah."
"Listen, do you see what I see?"
Sugar ain't around.
He must be upstairs.

Maybe we should get his attention.
"Well, no, maybe we should just look around and try and find clues."
"Smash, smash this place up a bit."

I don't want to...
Let him know we're here!
Like really smash it up.

You can't leave the place without answering us.
I have no obligations to do so.

I'm a cop myself!
You can tell me.
- Auto!
Why is he so adamant?
I don't know.
Start the bike.
Come on.
I'm dead!
"Though I wasn't a super-cop, I was at least called a mediocre one."
"I might lose that even identity now, because of you!"

"Let's go, Panju."

"No, no, no."
We did multiple takes.
But what I mean is it's one angle.
- This was like...
- Almost one take.
There's one cut.
- I love that part.
- Me too.
One-Take Cera...
Did One-Take Cera show up?
Because One-Take Dennings never showed up.
- One-Take Cera did not show up.
- Okay.
But that's because One-Take Sollett was not on the premises.
I don't even think One-Take Graynor has ever been uttered before.
I used to say before we started to shoot a scene:
"""This is One-Take Dennings."
"One-Take Dennings."""
"And I thought maybe I would get it in one take, but it never happened."
"In ADR, One-Take Dennings maybe showed up once."
- There you go.
- She did show up.
- In post.
- She showed up for post.
She was in L.A. the whole time.

I thought maybe somebody here would have an idea where he might be.
"Yes, this is about Claire, isn't it?"
"Yes, sir."
Yes.
I'm afraid it is.
I heard about the shooting on the radio.

So how long have you lived in Los Angeles?
I...
They were out of scones.
"Sheldon, I'm talking to someone."
You're being rude.
I'll bet you're an actress.
"If not, you should be."
You have a very expressive face.
"Oh, my God."
"Wait, where are you going?"
Because he didn't want to go to a foster home.
He didn't want to leave and I didn't want him to leave either.
"It's like, you force me to live amongst these... these pod people and the first cool person I meet, it's like, you kick him out of the house."
I did the best I could.
So did I.
Come on.
Police want to ask us some more questions.
You and I need to talk.
And this time I want the truth.
I'm sorry.
Ryan Atwood?
We got some questions for you.
It was an accident.
"Yeah, you were there?"
Yeah.
"Then we got some questions for you, too."
"Officer, I'm Mr. Atwood's attorney."
Please don't ask him any questions unless I'm present.
"Ryan, keep your mouth shut."
"You, too."
Vic!
"Come on, dude!"
–Tell me you're leaving!
–That which doesn't kill me...
Come on!
Come on!
Let go!
Vic!
Hi.
David Aceveda.
Vote for me.
"Bob, what's the matter with you?"
"If they catch you here, the two of us will be thrown out of school."
You mean the three of us.
I saw him come in here.
You saw who come in here?
"Your boyfriend, Wilbur."
(NANCY CHUCKLING)
"What's wrong with you, darling?"
"Oh, save your ""darlings"" for Wilbur."
"I tell you, at this moment, Wilbur is in his room sound asleep."
He's not here?
He's not here.
He's in his room sound asleep?
He's in his room sound asleep.
"Okay, I'm gonna find out."
You do that.
Good evening.
(MUMBLING)
We're delighted that you both could come.
We were happy to come.
"Would you excuse me, please?"
Certainly.
Enjoy yourselves.
I've been trying to see you all day.
I locked my windows.
And what's that supposed to mean?
You can figure that out for yourself.
(ALL APPLAUDING) Maybe Wilbur can help me.
"Bob, I don't know what's come over you lately."
You've just got to stop picking on Wilbur!
"Bob, what are you waiting for?"
What?
Why did you go there?
Don't you get a newspaper at home?
You are changing the topic again.
You can try.
You cannot avoid me.
- Why did you go there?
- Shiv!
What's wrong...
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with you?
I am getting married.
Okay?
And he's just the type of guy I want.
"Intense, charming.."
Silent.
Silent in bed as well?
Stop your nonsense and leave!
I am the one talking nonsense?
I am the one talking nonsense?
He's just your type?
He's charming?
What were you doing with me?
What were you doing with me?
"Tell me, what were you doing with me then!"
Tell me something.
Listen... please.
I won't do anything.
Listen to me.
I understand that economics is important.
"I am a banker, I understand."
But doesn't chemistry mean anything?
-Mr.
Wheeler.
-Mm-hmm.
Is this toad flax?
"No, that's lmpatiens capensis."
That's also known as touch-me-not.
"You guys, I found a touch-me-not."
"Untouched, unspoiled, here in the middle of suburban uniformity, you can find..."
a tiny wilderness.
Dad.
"Brian, don't be an idiot."
"Hey, Dad... whoa."
I need to talk to you for a second.
I didn't know he had a daughter.
I need you to fix my car.
I was planning on fixing that after school.
I can't wait that long.
"I mean, I need to leave town."
I've got to get out of here right now.
"T ell me about it, lady."
We all want to get out of here.
Are you late for an appointment with a client?
Are you a religious fanatic or something?
No.
Why?
Oh... 'cause you're just the most understanding man
I've ever met.
Thank you.
"Wow, look at this place."
What is this?
This is the...
T anapaya Wet Lands.
He's the birthday boy.
He's just like his father.
Nice kid.
I'm so hungry.
Dump your rubbish here.
Dump your rubbish here.
You can go.
We'll make a short tour through the Efteling Park.
"Finally, we can sit."
We'll get that bloody fascist.
No matter how.
"That's only for laughs, mom."
What's this?
What does Queen Beatrix want with that comedian?
"One moment, sir."
"-It's from last week, mom."
"No, last week's one was about Martine Bijl and that tall man."
What's his name?
From that comic duo.
"No, that's Prince Pieter, who can't play the piano because of his hands."
Terrible... cancer in your hands.
"-Yes, terrible."
Money can't buy happiness.
"-No, but it's nice to have."
We'll buy this one.
"Look, Marco Bakker will never sing again!"
With a record!
-We'll play it on the stereo!
Fantastic!
-We'll get this one too.
Anything else?
"-No, that's enough."
Clamp.
Clamp.
Keep steady pressure.
3-0 silks.
3-0 standing by.
More gauze.
Gauze.
- Got it open.
"- Okay, clamp it."
"Here you go, doctor."
- Keep the pressure on.
"- Yes, sir."
Let's get some more gauze in here.
"Okay, she's under."
I want you two stationed right here.
Do not leave unless you hear directly from me.
"Okay, Jack, those are all the questions I'm obliged to ask."
"If you got anything else you want to add, Jack, now would be the time."
"That's my statement, as it is."
"My god, Tony."
Nina tried to commit suicide.
"She jammed her neck into Richards' needle, ruptured an artery."
Where is she now?
She's in the clinic being operated on.
Who's with her?
"Don't worry, Jack, she's sedated."
I saw her go under.
Who's with her now?
"Tony, who's with her?"
!
Damn it!
Which way did she go?
Hello?
Okay.
We will add numbers to the beginning and end of the old number.
Try all the combinations.
What's this?
"If it were a test, I could skip the questions I can't answer."
"Excuse me, ma'am."
Can you come down to the cashier?
Why?
What happened?
"This way, please."
The alarm went off.
It's almost one o'clock.
Where are you?
I tried.
I tried them all.
None of them worked.
That's impossible.
I am out of here or we'll get caught.
"No, wait."
Try again by putting them at the beginning.
"Ma'am, there was a little misunderstanding."
Please forgive us.
There's no need to apologize.
"Actually, I was kind of in a hurry."
You've wasted my time.
"Come on, baby."
Let's get out of here.
It's not working.
None of it's working.
"Come on Uluc, work your head."
What password would a mathematician use?
But we're not supposed to leave.
Miss Pearl made that very clear.
You gonna stop me?
I didn't think so.
- Anna.
- Surprised?
I thought you and your mom were leaving town.
Change of plans.
"I'm sorry, I thought you'd be psyched."
"No, no, no."
"I mean, I am."
Of course I am.
"All right, then."
Step aside.
Heh.
Don't be grumpy.
It can't be that bad.
You'd be surprised.
"My primary reason for existence has abandoned me and after today's events, the remains of the shaky ground that I walk on are about to go kaboom."
Let's get hammered.
Let's.
- Whoo!
Ha-ha-ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.
At least they're having fun.
They're drunk.
Remember when Elena's parents busted us here after homecoming?
"- Oh, my God, yes."
- We were wasted.
It was the first time I got drunk.
I blame Matt.
Her parents got seated at the next booth.
- Hey!
- Get this lion off of me here.
- No!
No!
You stop it.
This is my fight.
Do you understand me?
I'm sick of men getting in my way.
This is my fight.
You hear me?
- You hear what I'm saying?
"- Maybe we should leave these two alone, huh?"
Okay.
"We'll see you next Friday, huh?"
"""Beauty Versus the Beast II."""
"Come on, Brianna."
Here we go.
- You're not ready for this fight.
"- Oh, I have an idea, Dad."
Why don't you shut your fat little monkey face and hold the bag?
I'm gonna paralyze this bitch.
"Yes, Dad, I know the fight is in a few hours, all right?"
I'm trying to find my goddamn headband.
Is that okay?
Is it okay with you if I find my headband before I come down there?
"Is that all right with you, Dad?"
Jesus!
Why didn't we get the orange one like I said?
This one might as well be goddamn camouflaged!
"Oh, good."
Are you happy now?
I just punched a hole in my wall!
"For the sake of my happiness, won't you let me have a month of my life?"
"Please Babuji, give me one month"
Go.
Live it up
My baby
Where's Simran?
Where might she be?
- Has she slipped in the loo?
I told you to wake up Raj Did you?
No
Open sesame
Do you have the keys to this?
Anybody home?
No one at home
Haven't I seen you somewhere?
"At Robbie's party, no?"
I don't go to parties.
- Great!
"Nor do I, ever"
Your eyes...
What's wrong with my eyes?
Reminds me of someone.
- Of whom?
My grandmother.
"Like you, her eyes too had hues of yellows and blues"
Keep reading.
I only wanted to find out how you read upside-down
This is the limit!
"Simran, you're here?"
I heard you've missed the train.
"- No, I took it"
I was afraid...
One's clear.
Hey.
You all right?
Yeah.
I'm a little nauseous.
It takes me a couple days to get back up to terminal.
- What's going on?
- There was a shooting across the street.
- Anybody you know?
"- No, but still."
- Kind of scary when it happens so close.
- Yeah.
So I heard you' re getting released today.
"My next round of chemotherapy's in about two days, so I thought I'd come by, say so long."
- How's your mom doing?
- You mean is she still pissed at you?
"No, I didn't mean exactly that, but..."
- She's still pissed at you.
- Good to know.
"She's upstairs with the ""doc."""
Does she know you' re here?
I kind of snuck off.
I actually might need one of those basins.
I think you need some IV Compazine.
- That sounds good.
- All right.
I'll go tell your mom you' re here.
Will you watch him for a minute?
I'm not a child.
"Yeah, Marky!"
"Yeah, Marky!"
- Yeah!
"""now that you explained it,"
"It's comin' pretty easy."""
"Axl, ever since we got home,"
I can't stop thinking about aunt Edie.
That bone spur thingy on her foot?
"No, but ew."
You know what we need to do?
We should totally take her to dig up that old time capsule!
"Yeah, I'd love to drive my dor sister"
"And senile aunt around, then dig hole."
Let's go!
"Axl, you need to start thinking outside of yourself!"
Look at beyonce she has every reason
"In the world to be selfish, and she still gives back!"
Wouldn't it be amazing if we could find the capsule
For aunt Edie and make her dreams come true?
!
Sorry.
My time is way too valuable.
Hoo!
Ha!
Hoo-ha-ha!
Hoo!
Oh!
I know this one!
Ha!
I got one before you.
"Oh, so you finally got one, did you, dear?"
Why don't you come to the board and show us your work?
"No, no, no."
I'm good.
I wasn't asking.
"Why, I haven't washed or even powdered and here you are."
"You know, you gotta be careful."
"You sitting around in a damp thing, you catch a cold."
"especially when you been exercising hard, Iike bowling is."
"-well, you're the teacher, aren't you?"
-Yes.
-What do you teach?
-english.
"well, I never was a very good english student."
-How long you here for?
"-Why, I don't know yet."
You gonna shack up here?
"I thought I would, if it's not inconvenient for you all."
Good.
traveling wears me out.
"well, take it easy."
What was that?
"Oh, those cats."
"Hey, stella."
"What did you do, fall asleep in there?"
"well, I guess I'm gonna strike you as being the unrefined type, huh?"
"You know, stella spoke a good deal about you."
"She said you were married once, weren't you?"
Yes.
When I was quite young.
Yeah?
What happened?
-Yeah?
What happened?
-The boy....
The boy died.
I'm afraid I--
Let me go!
You swine!
I'll give it to you right in the face!
Bastard!
You know how Franz lost his arm?
He wouldn't obey either!
So I grabbed him just like this and pushed him out of the car!
Murderer!
Help!
Help!
We wander through the whole wide world
We wander because we enjoy it so
We wander over hill and dale
We wander through the whole wide world
Let's go!
What's the matter?
Where's Mieze?
I heard her yelling.
She's not yelling anymore.
Let's go!
NO SHORT SWIM TRUNKS ALLOWED
Mieze's run away.
What can I do?
She left her clothes and everything behind.
- Did you hit her?
- Yeah.
What's she doing with a louse like me?
It was just the one time.
One time or ten ― it's the same thing.
I know who she ran off with.
- Who?
- A guy she knew before.
Do you still have the photographs?
"Yeah, I have everything inside."
"Stuart, can you go grab my negatives for me?"
Copy that.
"Be right back, billy."
What are you hoping to find?
We're trying to clear a good man's name.
¶ ¶
"These are, uh, these are all from the enright crime scene."
"Okay, let's scan those."
All right.
Let me invert the images.
"All right, there's jesse, there's the house,"
"The front gate, more house."
"What else we got, eric?"
wait a minute.
"Eric, go back."
Go back.
What is he doing?
"Evidence marker number four, eric."
"Number four, that's the cuff link."
That's the missing evidence.
Right.
Who is this?
I don't know.
It isn't cardoza.
It's not jesse.
Who is that?
Let me clean up the flare on his face.
Hitting the highlights.
Clean up some of this mess.
Captain sutter.
"Wal, you're living in a bubble."
"Mate, those seats are gone."
They're rooted.
And I don't mean that in a nice way.
That's the status quo.
We're not married.
Every year they hold the State party conference in a different place.
That's usually a lot of fun for the wives.
"You know, my Joe's got his eye on your David."
Why?
Is he gay?
"Oh, I don't know what he is sexually."
I'm just married to him.
(Women laugh)
"Wendy, Wendy, stop yelling."
Thank you.
"Listen, Wendy!"
Just don't speak to John Bartrop.
Do not speak to him.
"There's no point in speaking to Bartrop, OK?"
Leave the school out of it.
I'll talk to Fuzz.
Leave it to me.
I'll talk to him and Mrs Robinson.
Yeah.
Who's John Bartrop?
"A puff of air in a mohair cardigan, and my new name of choice for telemarketers and Mormons."
Right.
Bang!
"The first cut gets him there, and then he's down, he's dead."
"And then bang, bang, bang, three symmetrical wounds there."
And then...
I've been in a lot of scrapes.
What about that one?
That was teenage experiment.
Wanted to see if I could take the pain.
And could you?
Comfortably.
We're gonna do some balloons.
I've got a better idea.
Truth or Dare?
Dare.
Any suggestions?
I think we need to sex this party up a bit.
"- What do you think, boys?"
- Yes.
I can do sexy.
Eleanor...
"I dare you... to give Gemma... a long... hot, wet kiss on the mouth."
- Tongues?
- Absolutely.
"Excuse me, do I get a say in this?"
"- No, no, no, no, no..."
"- Rules of the game, babe."
"Oh, yeah, I've still got it."
And I hope you're not expecting me and Chris to do that.
We don't need any of that queer shit.
"Yeah, that-that-that's what I'm saying."
I get enough of that in the army.
"Okay, stop being weird and spin the bloody bottle."
"Truth or Dare, Gemma?"
Um...
"I don't know, truth."
Will you take me back?
You know I got to go do this thing.
Where are my keys?
Over there.
It's a mess. lt's like a pig pen.
"What do you think I got you the dishwasher for, huh?"
I hate doin' the dishes...
Fucks with my nails.
You gotta be smart.
Look at all this powder around here.
It's enough to put us away forever.
Henry..stop.
Loosen up.
What are you doing?
You don't have to go anywhere.
Make them wait.
Nobody knows for sure just how much was taken in the daring pre-dawn raid at the Lufthansa cargo terminal at Kennedy Airport.
"The FBI says $2,000,000, Port Authority Police say $4,000,000."
"The city park says $5,000,000"
Those son-of-a-bitches!
...from the scene of the heist at JFK.
It looks like a big one.
Maybe the biggest this town has ever seen.
"Come here, you!"
Come here!
Look at this genius.
This genius!
"Merry Christmas, Jimmy!"
-Who's this?
-That's my wife.
"Come here. I want to show you something, Jimmy."
Isn't she gorgeous?
I bought it for my wife. lt's a coupe. I love that car.
"Okay,this way!"
"Move,move,move!"
"Okay,behind the barricade."
"Get down,get down."
All right.
"Okay,steady,steady,steady,steady."
"All right,come to daddy."
"All right,there you go.All right."
Got it.
Tanner!
"All right,get in there now!"
"We're coming,we're coming!"
"Tanner.Tanner,come on,buddy."
Couple of things:
You just killed a good man...
And my legs hurt.
We translated your song.We dug up every mine you planted.
Not every one.
"""Twin Tree""?"
That one went off 20 years ago.
- How many people went with it?
- Not a soul hurt.
- You're lying.
- Okay.
"I planted that mine on mount Sutro,right on the trail everyone took to the top."
No.That land was already sold to the state when you planted your mine.
No one's taken that trail in 50 years.
Hauser.
But thanks for telling me where to dig.
So have you found the twin tree?
It's you.
- You're here.
Yeah.
"You know, I'm glad you changed your mind."
"Oh, yeah, I'd much rather be in here than out there."
"I know, you can room with my brother."
He's just about your age.
"Oh, won't that be a lot of fun."
"Bob, will you take him over to my house?"
I'll join you later.
"You know, there are 200 girls waiting to meet you."
"Oh, and I just can't wait to meet them."
"Come on, Wilbur."
He's a remarkable boy.
GIRL:
"Come on, hurry!"
Come on.
"Oh, get it!"
"No, no!"
"Catch, Uncle Bob."
"Wilbur, come here."
(STUTTERING) Thank you for the game.
"Come on, come on."
Come here!
"What is this, an obstacle course?"
Wilbur!
"Come on, Wilbur."
"What kind of school are you running here, anyhow?"
"It's a school for girls, and the reception committee is going to be here any minute."
I don't need no reception committee.
Of course you do.
Why should you be any different?
Because I don't think I need a reception committee.
(BAND PLAYING)
Welcome.
- Thank you.
- This is my wife.
- I see.
Have you met Anna?
You must.
"- This is Jacob, who I told you about."
- Congratulations.
Christian.
This is Christian's mother.
There you are.
Care for a drink?
"Yes, please."
- Cheers.
Welcome.
- Thanks.
- Can I play?
- Yes!
Are you any good?
Good?
!
I'm the best.
Aren't you playing together?
"I stand not just before you, Anna   but also my boss and father-in-law, Jørgen   and Helene and, of course, the rest of you."
"Anna, we met at Jørgen's firm when it was in the suburbs."
I didn't dare speak to you because you were the boss's daughter.
Then one day you needed to borrow 1000 kroner.
Jørgen wasn't there and so I had to lend it to you.
You'd think he was marrying Jørgen.
"But Jørgen and Helene, I would like   to thank you for the way you've welcomed me into the family."
I know you think it's early for Anna to marry   but please know that it feels very right to me.
"Anna, I love you more than all the world."
I love them when they're silly.
"But if they get too silly, they have to come see me."
"- ""Silly""?"
- Mischief.
- Trouble.
- We use gentler terms.
As a policy.
"Well, so what happens when they come see you?"
"Well, we do things a little differently in our program."
The approach is progressive and positive.
"We issue a hug consent form to parents, which allows us to hug their kids."
"Because 99% of the time, all kids need"
- is a hug.
"- ""A hug""?"
- A squeeze.
"- Well, you squeeze 'em."
- An embrace.
- Oh.
- Oh?
- Well...
- What is it?
- Nothin'.
- Wayne.
- Yeah?
- Speak freely.
"- No, I'd better not."
That's the only way we'll get to know each other.
But do you ever smack 'em?
- Excuse me?
"- Like, give 'em a good whack?"
- I don't follow.
- Do you ever hit the kid?
Daddy.
Go crazy.
And here's a tiny little schnitzel and I'll take a tiny little bite...
"No, don't eat mine!"
I'm late for rehearsal.
"Go on, go to your rehearsal and don't do us any favors."
I know your assistant director can do the replacement.
"Sure, why not?"
Why don't we let Slava Chaplin do it?
Silkis.
Silkis.
Hello.
Are you Yitzhak Ben-Shmuel?
- Yes.
We have a search warrant.
"Yitzhak, what's going on?"
We have a search warrant.
What are you searching for?
"Goni, go to your room."
Why?
Come in.
Check the bookshelf.
Take a look in the bedroom.
"Don't worry, Goni."
They'll be leaving soon.
Don't you think you're out of line?
What do you think you'll find here?
"Tell them to stop, Yitzhak."
You and your damn police have some nerve!
Ora.
There's nothing we can do.
Let them finish.
Is it?
It was right about then that a question started nagging at me.
Is Phil sexy?
Hey.
You feel like doing something a little crazy with me?
What?
No.
What?
No.
"Hey, honey."
"Phil, honey, how you holding up?"
Good.
I'm at the beach...
Long story.
I was hoping you wouldn't mind waiting at the house for Luke's tutor.
"Actually, I would mind."
I'd mind quite a bit.
- I'm kind of busy.
- Okay.
"Cam, there's something that Claire would never approve of that I've always wanted to do."
Always?
We're gonna want to put a blanket down on that backseat.
This was a huge mistake.
I am jammed in the backseat with a hairy Peruvian biter.
It's spring break '92 all over again!
"Well, speed bump coming up."
Hold the leash taut.
It's supposed to keep her calm.
I got lucky.
I don't think this one's a spitter.
Ohh.
"Uh, I spoke too soon."
He really is a coward.
Fortunately I can run very fast.
Biggie!
Biggie!
"Mr. Chiu, what's the matter?"
Ask her to help me get dressed.
Biggie!
You only read the script in this moment.
Why are you still hesitating?
Hurry...
"You see me as nothing, hurry..."
How dare you.
Collect the laundry fee again?
Came back here.
"I'm not pushing you, you can paid me few days later."
Clean my wife's underwear too.
Well...
You clean it or not?
"Yes, but my sister will scold me."
I will bit you.
"Huang, you'll meet your match!"
"Master Tam, you've got a visitor."
A visitor?
Our school's famous in Canton.
You're a wanted man.
"True, we're partners in the past."
But I don't want to be investigated now.
I think you better lay low.
I still treasure our friendship.
I've got friends in the opera troupe.
Why don't you join them?
And we'll find a way for you.
He is not!
Henry would not date Dylan.
Why not?
You're not dating her anymore.
"Well, I mean, he can date her if he wants, but he knows I still like her."
I don't think he would ask her out on a date.
"But then again, I guess he did."
Huh.
"It's, uh..."
I can't believe that.
Fancy that.
I can't either.
"You're not maybe planning on going to the movies with Alice and then bumping into Henry and Dylan and doing a little do-si-do, are you?"
Go back upstairs.
You're not going anywhere.
And give me your phone.
What's the code?
D-Y-L-A-N.
(SIGHS) I figured.
"Look, come on, Dad, just let me go out with her."
Adrian's boyfriend is asking her to marry him and she's practically engaged and Amy's married and it's not fair!
See ya.
Can I at least call Alice and tell her not to come over?
"Her number's in your contacts, right?"
I'll call her.
"All right, that's just an invasion of privacy!"
Go.
I'm too old to be sent to my room!
I'm divorced!
I've lost a child!
I'm over 18.
I'm an adult!
- Yeah.
- Jacob.
I heard you were leaving.
- Can you give me one last blessing?
- Sure.
May the force be with you.
That... that's it?
"Yeah, I'm afraid so."
"For more details, see your local priest or rabbi."
Take care.
"- So, you all good?"
"- Yeah, I'm good."
"- Good, good..."
- More or less.
"Just, um..."
"I mean, you know, crazy as it sounds, I-I miss God."
"Well, if it's of any comfort,"
I'm sure God would be thrilled at your recovery.
Really?
How do you figure?
'Cause you serve God's neediest people by making tons of money and giving it away.
- God loves charity.
- All right.
"If you wandered the world with a begging bowl, who would that help?"
- Absolutely no one.
- Nobody.
"In fact, it'd be a sin."
"So go forth, continue to do God's work."
- All right.
Golf next week.
- Done.
"So, uh, is there anybody home?"
The two of us basically have a date.
And then he calls and invites me to a party at his place.
JANINE:
He so likes you.
I'm so happy for you.
Let's look up places for your destination wedding.
How do you feel about Napa Valley?
I have really always wanted to go there.
"Oh, he's cute."
Yeah.
Smoldering but sensitive.
"Oh. ""All I have is my guitar, these chords, and the truth."""
BOTH:
Bon Jovi.
- That's hot.
- Yeah.
I like him.
"I mean, he probably hasn't called yet because we just had coffee last night."
- Really?
MARY:
"Yeah, you know."
"I mean, we actually video iChatted while holding coffee."
"But that's the same thing, right?"
"- Right, right."
- Just call your voicemail.
"Yeah, but he had a gig last night and he probably didn't get home till late."
- Did I tell you he's a singer?
- Mm-hm.
- Just call.
JOSHUA:
"Oh, honey, no, on speaker."
I don't think so.
Does it have anything to do with Detective Hallstrom?
"Look, I don't want to talk about it, OK?"
You don't like him because you...
What?
Wanted you for myself.
I'm sorry.
This is stupid of me.
You're ready for contacts... if you want them.
Or glasses.
They'll correct you to 20/50.
Do you think I saw the killer?
"Seeing isn't something that happens to you, Emma."
It's something you do.
I gave you the equipment.
It's up to you to control it.
"If you invent these visions, you can stop them."
Do you think I invented him?
Doesn't matter what I think.
What do you think?
I'll call you later.
I got to go.
"Oh, sergeant, hi."
It's Detective Hallstrom from Chicago.
I'm trying to find out if Margaret Tattersall... spent any time in a hospital recently?
A lot of time?
She got a new kidney.
"Hey, you just can't..."
That's OK.
It's OK.
It's all right.
Where's John?
What's the problem?
"Believe me, Freddie, we're agreed on that."
"Shut up and listen, Harry!"
Your debt is useless to me.
I can't sell it on.
No one will touch you.
So I'm calling it in.
- What?
- You have three days.
You do realize that's a completely insane request?
"What's going on, Freddie?"
OK.
Take this as a down payment.
You must know some powerful people in your line of business.
You should ask for a favor.
"He's arrived then, eh?"
The new DSI?
Yeah.
I worked with him a long time ago.
Interesting guy.
Long night?
"No, no."
I turned in early.
I was whacked.
What's Orwell got?
Body dragged out of the Thames.
Young woman.
No ID yet.
"You didn't really have an early night at all, did you?"
"You don't have an off button, do you, Suri?"
I just believe in the redemptive power of sleep.
Clears out the molecular garbage in our brains.
Molecular garbage?
About everyone screwing everyone.
What you read in the tabloids.
It's even worse.
- l could tell you stories.
- Tell me.
There's one bigwig when he throws a party the neighbors secure their kids behind locks this big.
Kids six or seven years of age.
"Girls, but boys too."
What do you think of that little boys?
- Hello sir.
"Hi, Herman."
- Adrienne...
Madam told me to clean up.
Won't you join us?
Funny bunny.
"Tell me more, Gerard."
Later in the car.
- Coming?
- Good morning.
- What the hell are you doing?
- For later!
You with a famous writer!
Who cares...
Bye!
"Now tell me, do these TV people go at it all the time?"
They slow down in their 80's.
Can't we flnd a quiet place in the dunes?
I'm a nature lover.
"Ah, I like touring."
"And are those showgirls an easy lay, too?"
"- You revel in such things, don't you?"
- l love sex.
Make him shut up!
I can't make him talk and shut up at the same time.
I've had enough of this!
Enough!
I was giving him a truth serum.
We've given it to him three times... and all he admitted was that he was a homosexual.
Thirty cc's of Pentothal to have him say he's homosexual.
"It's a deginning, no?"
We've already wasted a lot of time.
Mougeotte.
Dear Mougeotte.
Tell us where the microfilm is... or I'll put a dullet in your head!
I don't know where it is!
I don't even know what microfilm is.

No need to look further.
They have it.
They've arrested Martin and Dupré.

They've infiltrated our ring.
You sold it to the other side.
Excuse me?
You chose the wrong camp.

"[Mike] I think I know how to find him, take it easy."
my son is missing.
"Come on, how do you get out to the Peterson place?"
Tell us.
What do you want to go out there for?
- Because he's got my son.
- Just tell us how to get out there!
"Well, it's east on the highway, left on State Road G about a mile."
It's about a quarter of a mile from the Desert Castle.
"All right, now, now, call the sheriff."

"- It really makes you, like, squirm."
So good.
"- Oh, my God."
- I love Kevin Corrigan.
"Okay, Englewood."
Okay.
"Well, the last bus to Englewood left seven minutes ago."
You see?
She's fine.
Let's go.
"No, just because there was a last bus doesn't mean she was on the last bus."
- You and your logic.
- I'm trying her again.
"- Oh, no."
Don't throw up.
"- Oh, God."
The thing that's too bad is that there were many other throw up scenes in the original and now there's...
"No, I mean, that's a good thing."
- I don't...
"- Remember, there were like...?"
- We shot four other throw-up scenes.
- On the bus.
Remember?

- Leslie is at a strip club looking at hot naked men who are not you.

"Women are complicated, man."
"Oh, my."

See you soon!

She is too cute.
It gives much joy.
Let's eat?
"Sorry, I have to work."
They lack personnel.
Serious?
Let's go eat where you work.
"Okay, but not seeking discounts."
- You guessed it?
- Obviously.
"Yagami, you want to become official?"
It's not my concern more than that.
"You got the ambition, right?"
I know not you can become rich.

(BANG!
It has been a while.
I'm coming in to take a look.
Are you used to this place?
You are not eating?
"Then I will stop bringing it to you, since it's a waste of food to feed you."
Cat...
Oh right...
"Oh my, you ate it all of a sudden."
You irritate me.
Eat more...
"Cat, cat..."
"Good, good."
Eat more if you like it.
"Good, good."
You are a good boy.
Good boy.
Don't make any noise.
Father has been obsessed with you lately.
How pitiful...
"Cat, cat, you are a good boy living by his whims."
Yoshikuni.
F-Father?
You... when did you...
You are just a commoner.
"Know your place, you filthy beast!"
"You are unforgivable, unforgivable, unforgivable, unforgivable!"
Unforgivable!
What is this you bastard!
You are just a lowly beast!
Run.
You must go to the world outside.
Cat... cat... run...
"I'm in a hurry, Pierre."
What do you want to know?
"Where have the 40,000 euros come from?"
What are you insinuating?
"I don't know. 40,000 euros were deposited in this account, the firm's account, and they disappeared."
I'm wondering.
This money was sealed.
My client needed to get it back in cash.
I helped him.
That's all.
Why make it go through the firm's account?
You couldn't deposit it in his account directly?
He doesn't have an account.
His banking privilege is suspended.
You don't believe me?
Call him.
"Go ahead, call him!"
You wouldn't take the risk of lying to me.
"I give you my word, all right?"
Arnaud Ledoré?
Hello.
How are you?
Hello.
- Do you remember me?
Do you know Mr Delcourt?
Can we talk to you for two minutes?
Yes.
What about?
It's about Julie.
Julie.
That's enough.
- Who filmed that?
"Haunting, beautiful."
I used to like to play that on rainy nights... sitting in front of a roaring fire by the fireplace.
I don't have a roaring fire.
You don't have a girl in your arms either.
"Now, look, this isn't Laura."
Hilla is not gonna come through that door drenched with rain.
"Al, look, I-"
"- I know I'm being a little irrational about this, but..."
I'm the only one on Hilla's side.
That's not true.
She's got me.
You finally can see that she didn't do it?
Hilla and I are both orphans.
We gotta stick together.
Now-
- Let's see-- Let's see if Ziggy's got anything new here.
"- He's liable to get tough, Mr. Smith."
"- Let him out, I said."
- What's his name?
- We call him Buck.
"I don't like to take the responsibility, Mr. Smith."
That's why you'll never amount to much.
What are you asking for him?
"Uh, 250 bucks."
Sold.
Let him out.
"So your name's Buck, eh?"
"You're tough, huh?"
"Hey, wait a minute."
That dog cost me a lot of money.
"- I pay for my pleasure, Mr. Groggins."
- Wait a minute.
You want a cookie?
Of course not.
You can tell from a guy's face.
And especially from his crotch.
I've got a sixth sense.
"He's friendly with Benigno, isn't he?"
Yes.
"He isn't a faggot too, is he?"
No way.
Are you nuts?
Are you insinuating Benigno's a faggot?
I'm not.
"It's vox populi, honey."
You're very wrong.
Dr.Vega confirmed it for me.
How would he know?
Alicia's father told him.
"I don't approve of him being so intimate with the patient, but Dr.Vega told me not to worry."
"Benigno doesn't like women, he's into men."
My God!
I'll leave so you can carry on pulling him to bits.
The poor thing likes Benigno.
"Good choice, sweetie."
I'm free tonight.
I'm going to the Cinematheque.
- Want to come?
- I'm meeting my editor.
I'll have to go back to work soon.
This woman isn't well.
"- Benigno, please."
- You know what I mean.
Her skin's really dry.
"No disturbance, that's an order."
Yan-ling!
Jun-kit!
What happened?
Fung-wu!
Stop!
What's this all about?
They won't let Yan-ling see you.
You must have provoked them!
No!
He said there can be no disturbing the chess game.
Is it true?
It's the Highness's order.
No disturbance from anybody.
Please go to Mr. Chao!
And you two better leave.
You better go back!
Fung-wu!
"Go back, don't cause any trouble!"
Let's go!
I feel something odd will happen tonight.
Now why is chess so mysterious?
It's a game.
You go on ahead.
I'll keep watch here.
Make sure you don't fight!
I won't!
We don't accept anybody as a monk so easily.
I want to acquire the mystery of Shaolin kung-fu.
I'm a sincere Buddhist.
What's wrong with accepting me?
Please calm down!
It's very pretty.
It's a gift.
"Don't be surprised, it's nothing special."
You want to reorganize the factory.
It will only be possible... if you're in charge.
Put it in the other room.
A bit further behind.
Djénéba!
We have to see each other less frequently.
Why?
I'm not afraid of gossip.
People stick their noses into other people's business.
Do you mean my husband?
Of course.
You'll regret... the day when... he catches you.
There's nothing to be worried about.
Sure there is!
He's already been divorced four times.
"Right now he loves you, make the best of it."
Enough.
I know what I want.
Don't get angry.
Let's change the subject.
What are you doing on Thursday?
I don't know yet.
What's your plan?
Come over by my house.
I won't be able to.
Sing to Fakoli!
Praise his majesty!
Fakoli's worthy descendant.
Great Griot!
This is the Jordan family estate?
Wasn't no Jordan family nothin'.
This is where I was in foster care.
Oh.
Sorry.
Me and two other dudes and a girl with messed-up fingers.
I'm so lucky I got out of here.
"It's not luck, I mean..."
"You got out of here because you're very talented, and... people love you, and..."
Are you peeing?
Where's Donaghy?
I wanna talk to him right now.
"Last time I saw him, he was riding a crane camera."
"Oh, I have Pete for you."
"Pete, oh, my God."
I didn't know.
"No, hey, listen."
It'll--it'll give me a chance to spend more time with my kids.
I'm quitting.
I'm quitting right now.
"No, no, no, no, no."
You have the best job in New York.
Don't quit over this.
Don't buy all the hot dogs.
Okay?
I don't want to do this without you.
"Hey, I thought we cut the Cat Lady sketch."
We're two minutes short!
"So, let me introduce myself."
My name is Lurleen Katz.
And these are my cats.
She's using a real cat?
You should have pubic hair.
"Oh,please."
The head of the English department has a Prince Albert.
So we says.
"You know,you should try this."
It's actually making me kind of randy.
"It's like all out there,you know?"
"I know,I saw."
Augie is going to lose his mind.
That's great.
Why can't you come with me?
I can't put pants on.
I'm all tender.
- So wear a skirt.
- I'm going to be cold.
Wrap a scarf around it.
I think tonight I'm going to consist of S'mores and marathon sex with a grateful boyfriend.
"Fine,whatever."
You suck.
Have fun.
"You,too."
So why didn't I ever meet this guy?
Because we spent most of the relationship sitting in his van talking about feelings.
"You know,sometimes I'm out and I look around at all the men and it makes me want to go home and,like,knit Marty blanket or something."
"Go,Johnny!"
"Whoa,crybaby's a little badass."
Bitch!
Bitch!
Bitch!
Bitch!
Bitch!
Bitch!
"That's you, Frank."
I'm a wild horse.
That's what makes us such a great team.
- It's so unfair.
- What?
"- It's boring, but I give it my all."
- The idea is for her to get off.
- Why don't you lick the alphabet?
- Why?
So she thinks I'm clever?
Haven't you ever licked the alphabet?
"First you lick an A, then a B, C..."
The variation really turns them on.
Everybody does it.
- You never have?
- Never.
- Nicolaj Kopernikus taught me.
- Does he even know the alphabet?
"He told me he'd gotten complaints, so he'd adopted that technique."
- Thanks.
- Cheers.
- Are we going to the office?
"- Yes, but..."
"One, two..."
I can't drive.
Will you give me a lift?
We have to stop by the home and pick up the Gimp.
- You have to meet the mouth painter.
- Right.
But you're using your hand.
Listen...
"The picture you sold me, you painted with your mouth, right?"
"Say, would your hotel give us a discount on our wedding?"
What's the point?
You'll dump me once you make it big anyway.
Not when we've invested 1.4 million yen in you.

"Hey, stop for a sec."
Hello?
I'm leaving.
"Yes, I'll rehearse first, then head to the venue early."
After the show?
Okay.
Good morning.
Morning.
Morning.
"Morning, sir."
"Room 302, door is open."
"Room 302, occupied."
Streetwalkers often stand outside.
"If they enter, ask them to leave."
Anything else?
The whole second floor is rented to a porn shoot from 11 AM.
"No need to clean that floor, then."
"Well, until 5 PM."
"Say, Manager, we're almost out of 100 yen coins."
"Oh, hell."
Borrow some from Atlas 2.
"Sato, go there later."
I caught a cold.
"And without insurance, I can't see a doctor."
"Fine, I'll go."
Sorry for the trouble.
I can't lose this time!
Mama ain't seen you that low in years.
I haven't seen a road like this in years.
"- Well, then let's cruise, baby."
- Low and slow.
E bellissima!
It's beautiful!
"Guido, look, it's-a like it was paved by angels."
"Boy, I tell you what."
I bet even the roads on the moon ain't this smooth.
"Doc, look at this!"
"Shoulda tossed him into the cactus a lot sooner, huh?"
"Well, he ain't finished yet."
Still got a long way to go.
"Guido, look at Luigi!"
This is fantastico!
That looks like fun!
"Mater, I got dibs, next turn!"
"Hey, Luigi, this new road makes your place look like a dump."
That crazy old devil woman.
Oh!
She's right!
- Ah!
- Guido!
Huh.
That punk actually did a good job.
"Well, now... where the heck is he?"
Sheriff!
Is he makin' another run for it?
"No, no."
"He ran outta asphalt in the middle of the night, and asked me if he could come down here."
All he's tryin' to do is make that there turn.
"No, no, no, no!"
Every cop in Pittsburgh thinks I'm a rat.
You're not a rat.
You told the truth.
Nick knows that.
"Yeah, we'll look where it's got me."
"It's tough, but you know what my dad used to say?"
"""Loyalty above all else, except honour."""
We're pursuing a murder suspect.
"'89 Ford, dark blue, RHX715."
We just crossed the 31st StreetBridge.
Suspect is armed and dangerous.
- Let's go.
- So much for the policeman's ball.
Take Bigelow.
- Don't you have a date tonight?
- You're my date.
- What happened to that nurse?
- It just didn't work out.
"You've got to give these things a chance, Tommy."
That girl that works for Dutch is awful nice.
- Is there some meaning in all this?
- Grandkids.
What?
I'm not that grown up myself yet.
- There they are.
- Go down the alley.
Send an ambulance to the southbound tube.
We'll trap him at 2nd Ave.
Captain Hardy.
Get out of the car now with your hands up.
- Uncle Nick.
- Is this the policeman's ball?
"- What, screw with you?"
Because I can.
You're my son.
Thank you.
I'm sorry I can't be 15 minutes early like you are.
I have an actual job I go to.
"- Collecting disability, I'm sure, is not as time-consuming as whatever you're doing."
Do you two need a minute?
I can come back.
No.
It's fine.
"What are you having, Dad?"
I'm buying.
I'll have a couple of scrambled.
Is that all?
You don't want bacon?
You love bacon.
Get bacon.
He loves bacon.
Get him some bacon.
Rye toast.
Right?
And I'll have scrambled egg whites and avocado.
Thank you.
Avocado?
Is that what you eat with your lawyer friends?
Avocado.
- I'll be right back.
Why do we...
"Can we just, like, try to have a normal conversation of some kind?"
I'm not starting anything.
- Fine.
Don't know her.
You sure?
She worked there the same time you did.
Lots of girls worked the club.
They come.
They go.
Some stay only for couple of days.
"How come you looking for her anyways, somebody been gone that long?"
"A relative died, left her quite a bit of money."
"Here you are, Papa."
"If we want any money around here, I gotta catch the bus to go to work."
"Hey, maybe you can give my Kiki one ride."
Take the beer with you.
I'll call some of my friends from the old days.
"And you come back tonight, maybe I'll have something."
Fair enough.
Thanks.
"You get some rest, okay?"
Sure.
"Hey, stop fussing over me like I'm an old man."
"If I like, I can go swim all the way out there and back again."
"Well, you are an old man, but I love you anyway."
Aloha.
"Aloha, Papa."

What'd you tell him?
"[ Man Continues, Indistinct ]"
Okay.
I'll tell her.
"[ Woman ] Oh, uh, don't worry about dinner."
"All right, you then."
"- Uh, Wendy?"
"- Hi, Stan."
"Look, I just want you to know."
"If you want to, you know, be with that Briden kid, then you should."
What?
"I mean, I see the way you two are together and I don't wanna be in your way."
"- Stan, that's ridiculous."
- It is?
I would never leave you for Briden.
- Really?
"- No way, that'd be stupid."
I wouldn't have chance with Briden he could have any girl he wants.
"There you go, feel better, p-p-pal?"
What am I supposed to do?
I can't just sit back and watch some kid steal my girlfriend away.
"I mean, Wendy says she'll never leave me for him."
But what if she just doesnt wanna hurt my feelings.
"She said he could get any girl he wants and that means if he wanted, he could have my girl."
This is all so crazy.
"I mean, really, how could my day get any worse?"
No-no.
"No, I'm not doing it."
I'm not doing it.
"No, fuck off, I'm not doing it."
"Oh, geez, you're no fun."
"- Hey, Briden."
- Hey.
"- Hi, Briden."
- Hi.
"- Hey, Briden."
- Hey.
"""Take this, all of you, and eat it for this is my body."""
"When the supper was ended, he took the cup."
Again he gave you thanks and praise.
"He gave the cup to his disciples and said, ""Take this all of you, and drink from it."
This is the cup of my blood.
"The blood of the new and everlasting covenant, the mystery of faith."""
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
You'd like that?
Intensely.
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?
It would bring us together.
You and Regan?
You and us.
-Did you do that?
-Uh-huh.
-Do it again.
-In time.
"No, now."
In time.
"Mirabile dictu, don't you agree?"
You speak Latin?
How long are you planning to stay in Regan?
Until she rots and lies stinking in the earth.
What's that?
Holy water.
You keep it away.
It burns!
"Oh, it burns!"
Who are you?
"You know, I'm, like, in seclusion."
"No, I'm just exhausted from work."
Um....
Give it back to the women.
"Oh, thanks very much."
Little chap.
You're looking much better today.
Come on!
- Did you hear what that idiot asked of me?
"- No, what?"
- I wasn't allowed to take any holiday...
- Prisoners!
They're escaping!
Quickly!
- We must get away!
- What about John?
Better him than us.
Stop!
"Stop, or I'll shoot!"
"Come on, let's get away from here."
"Damn, it won't open!"
- The parcel has arrived.
- OK.
Let's have a look over there.
They're in there.
- Why didn't the capo come along?
- The town is crawling with militia.
- This is Smithy.
- Good work.
Thank you.
"For you, no effort was too great."
A tanker is going to take you out of town.
- The north would be too dangerous.
- I don't care about north or south.
- All I want is to fight Ramírez.
Together!
Yeah!
"-Yeah, that's the most, yeah."
-The Nike shop?
Louis...
-...shall we go in here?
"-Zayn, shall we go in here?"
"-Oh, my God!"
-Think a few fans have just spotted us.
probably tweeted.
"relax, everybody."
Come on.
will you all calm down now?
There you have it.
This is what happens.
Step back.
"Step back, please."
One Direction!
One Direction!
One Direction!
"We don't come out that often so we don't really see, Iike, this sort of side of it that often."
"So when we do, it's all a bit strange."
-I Iove you!
-Some girl was just trying to literally grab my ear.
"I think she wanted to keep it, but I was like:"
"""That's mine, love, you can't have that, unfortunately."
"It's connected."""
"Let's go, go, go."
Where'd the glasses come from today?
Somebody chucked them on stage.
I put them on.
These are sick.
"There are less spots, doc."
Rash: 31 spots 1 or 2 spots doesn't count as better.
But at least it's less.
Thank you.
Did you do exactly as I told you?
Yes.
Really?
Yes.
So what went wrong?
Let me ask you more personal questions.
I need to find out more.
What's your favorite food?
Shrimp dumplings from 7-Eleven.
Your favorite food is from 7-Eleven?
Nothing else to eat at night.
And it tastes good.
They also have rice balls.
Are you joking?
I'm not joking.
They really have them.
"Then on your free days, what do you do?"
Whoa that's hard to answer.
"No, it isn't."
"How about movies, music, the mall, and the beach?"
Nothing?
Everything you said is a waste of time.
How is that entertaining?
"Go to the mall, to do what?"
To buy clothes?
I don't buy any.
You don't buy any clothes at all?
I can still wear my old ones.
- Just leave me alone!
You little shi...
"Are you okay, Felix?"
"I mean, fucking crying, the big fucking girl!"
"You fucking crybaby doll, get off my fucking fanny!"
That was intense.
- You are such a bastard.
- And your point is?
"Yeah, walk away like a little girl."
"Cheers, geeze."
Yeah.
So how was Christmas?
Pretty boring.
It's good to be out and about again.
- You didn't come to McGinty's.
"- No, I couldn't make it."
- Okay.
- How was it?
Gemma was there.
So?
- I'm just saying is all.
"- You know she chucked me, right?"
"Yeah, I heard."
I am kinda kicking myself.
She was one sweet shag.
And they said romance was dead.
But it was all that bloody Felix's fault
"Right, but that was months ago."
- You sure it's such a big deal?
"- Yeah, it was to her."
"Said she'd seen the real me, blah-fucking-blah."
"I tell you what, I wouldn't mind landing another couple of punches on that twitchy little face of his."
Those two have been my bedrock.
"Yeah, I'm sorry about Darla."
"How's she doing, uh..."
How's she doing in prison?
I think she's okay.
"You know, I learned something."
Sometimes you just have to let your kids... sit in their own mistakes.
Sometimes you can't fix 'em.
Yeah.
"Well, I should get back to the hotel."
"You know, I'm guest of the day."
"[Chuckling] Say, listen, we have a half a pitcher of sangria, it's still early."
"Come on, hang around a while."
Okay.
Let me pour you some.
- Oh.
- Oh!
"Oh, I'm so sorry."
"No, no, no, don't worry about it."
Don't worry about it.
It's okay.
"No, I'm gonna show you something."
You're gonna love this.
- I'm such a klutz.
"- No, you're not a klutz."
"Stop it, you're not a klutz."
"That's what I've been sayin', I've been waiting to show this to somebody."
- [Spraying]
- Watch.
"This new Stain Master, it is amazing."
It is gonna revolutionize the carpet industry.

But today was different.
- That will be 3.75.
- But I didn't have to pay yesterday.
"Okay, 7.50."
"Oh, honey, sweetie, baby."
"It's the ring, Robin."
The ring has power.
When a woman puts on an engagement ring... it's like when Bilbo Baggins wears the one ring in The Hobbit.
- Okay.
"Can you say that again, but not in nerd?"
- Sure.
"Uh, the ring is like the cloak that Harry Potter wears to sneak around Hogwarts."
- I don't speak virgin either.
- The ring!
It makes you invisible.
You're not precious.
"Oh, good."
You're awake.
"Look, Ted, there's something we have to talk about."
Boundaries?
Invasion of privacy?
Losing your key privileges?
"It's about the 20-year-old, Ted."
You have to bang her.
For me.
Why do you want me to hook up with this 20-year-old?
I thought I disgusted you.
"Yeah, that was all an act."
"Look, look, look."
I love Robin.
And she's the only girl I wanna be with... but my body is detoxing after years of one-night stands.
You okay?
Can I get you anything?
"[Screaming] Oh, stop!"
"Pick your head up again, and I'll blow your fuckin' head off."
Stay right there.
Okay.

Good to see our fuckin' guy back.
You scared the shit out of him!
- I can't take these guys.
- And what'd we get?
I can drive this fucking car better than you can.
"What do we get, what we get, what we get, what we get, man?"
"What, what, what?"
Twenties and thirties.
"Oh, hey, I got it."
I got eleven.
"Hey, man, how much money we get?"
Nothin'.
We didn't get anything!
"Sam, you in there?"
You better give me my fucking share.
- Bullshit.
- There's tomorrow.
"Yeah, there's always tomorrow."
There's always tomorrow.
"You pissed, you pissed, and this goes."
It goes.
"Come on, guys, I can't drive with you guys like this!"
Mr. sawamato's position in the family places him at great risk.
They have both decided it would be safer to remain apart.
That's bullshit.
"I mean look how happy they are, you know?"
Look as shu.
I wouldn't want to hide that.
Neither would I.

Me and Nick go way back.
We used to hang out and do things I wouldn't even do with my brother.
We got some stories we could tell don't we Nick.
Hot one ain't it Billy?
"- No, Tommy."
- I promised Rosemary.
- What the fuck did you tell her?
Nothing.
She asked me to look out for you.
That's all I'm asking you to do.
Look out for me.
"And when you see me, don't stop."
"That way, you're not breaking any promises to anybody."
"Tell me, Paul..."
What?
Why do you want me under your train?
It's just...
I've had... two people die under my train this month.
"Jesus, you're a serial killer!"
No.
They weren't my fault.
They got this rule.
"If you have three in a month, they pay you off."
Ten years' wages.
Lump sum.
Mm...
What were you planning to do with this pay-off?
- Buy more books?
- Get out of London.
"Go and live in Scotland, on an island."
- Get away from everything.
- Really?
Life in the fast lane get too much for you?
Youth is wasted on the young.
"You know, somebody famous said that."
- What were you planning to do on this island?
"- Hey Reynolds, it's Trevor."
What time is it?
"How are they biting, Reynolds?"
"- You, you're drunk, Reznik."

I got proof on you.
I'm gonna use it.

"- Please, Stevie."

- Can you come back in an hour?
"No, no, no."
"No, no, I need to see you now."
"In case of something happens, I need someone to know."
"Okay, give me a minute."
"I appreciate you making time for me, you are the only one I can talk to."
My pleasure.
Most guys don't come here for my conversation.
"Something is happening to me, Stevie."
Some kind of... plot.
There was an accident at the shop.
A man was nearly killed thanks to me.
"- Oh, my god!"
- Now the guys at work are against me.
They want me out and I don't blame them.
Just the way they're going about it...
"Their eyes, their little games."
What?
E R..
- I doubt it.
- I'll give you $300 for him.
- Ha.!
- Five hundred.
Nope.
Not interested.
"I'll give you $1,000!"
That's a fabulous price to pay for a dog.
I could get a team of six for that.
What do you expect you'd do with him if I let you have him?
Give myself the exquisite pleasure of putting a bullet through his head.
"Yeah, that's what I thought."
"No, thanks."
"I'm sorry I can't contribute to your fun, mister."
Boo!
"What'll you have to drink, gentlemen?"
"Well, Jack, my boy, how is tricks?"
"Hello, Sam!"
How are you?
Glad to see you.
"Sam, this is Shorty."
- Hello.
"- Ah, yes!"
Just seen the argument you had with that fellow back there.
- He doesn't seem to like your dog.
"- No, no."
The dog doesn't like him either.
"Look, Sam, how you fixed?"
"Uh, pretty nearly flat."
"But anyhow, I got enough to ask you gentlemens to join me in a drink."
"- Bourbon, straight!"
- Ditto!

Nothing.

Hmm?
You were the one that taught me that.
- Mm-hm.
- What are you really doing here?
You caused quite a stir.
"You blew into town, saw everyone except for the man who made you."
- I'm a little hurt.
- I'm so sorry.
Did you bring the device?
[CHUCKLES]
- Ow.
"- Heh, heh."
- What are you doing with John Gilbert?
- We dated when we were young.
- He was a little bit in love with me.
"- I'm sure, one of the many."
"Now, this invention, what do you want with it?"
"Oh, me personally?"
I don't want anything with it.
I'm just doing what I'm told.
"You know, Damon, we're on the same side."
"- Oh, yeah?"
Which side is that?
- Katherine's.
She wants John Gilbert to have the device.
I think that you know that she's not happy when she doesn't get what she wants.
- Why are you doing her dirty work?
- Don't kill the messenger.
We both know that you can't control Katherine.
- She does what she wants.
- Pfft.
And so do I.
"- Oh, really, Damon?"
It was a good plan.
"But if there's one thing that I've learned in life, it's to always have a backup."
That would be you.
Your immunity makes you a perfect plan B.
You wouldn't turn from the bite.
You wouldn't die.
But you would be able to do one very important thing.
"Do you know what that is, Lydia?"
(distorted) Lydia!

"Is that you, Ines?"
I said...
Don't play with fire!
You'll get burned!
It doesn't hurt?
It won't hurt me?
"Oh God, my dear!"
Who did it?
What happened?
50 hours in surgical room.
That's crazy.
Even for you.
Do you think he will forgive me?
He will.
But I won't.
Is it time to get him?
For me?
What do you mean?
"A week with you, in 10 years of our marriage!"
- Anais...
- That's all I get.
Get some sleep.
Then you'll feel better.
"- Asger, can't you stay a while?"
- It's Saturday.
"Business, you know."
Just for a while.
I never did anything right.
Never.
Nothing.
I never did anything right.
Never.
Nothing.
I never did anything right.
Never.
The burn goes from my forehead down across the cheek.
I had three operations in Holland.
"It won't get any better, they say."
They took skin from my leg and put it on my face.
But my looks are of no importance.
"They are to others, but not to me."
I don't care if people stare at me.
"I'm not the same anymore, and I never will be."
It happened in the Pacific.
There was an explosion and a fire.
Many were killed.
My best friend was a ship's cook.
He died.
The Filipinos couldn't swim.
They died.
I didn't die.
I don't like to talk about it.
"I dived for as long as I could, but finally I had to get some air."
The half you don't need.
What's the matter?
You look like you haven't slept in a month.
I'm alright!
"I just found it easy when it was every night, at least you know what's coming."
"Well, never having known the joys of married love myself."
The bombing!
Ah!
I thought perhaps it was the long treks with the husband in the provinces.
Not really...it's difficult you know.
The trains.
Oh!
What is...?
What's that?
"It's France, uncle Frank!"
It's Hitler!
Bloody what!

Meeting now with Mr.Swain.
We were about to issue this shooting script.
They want all of you.
"Oh, no!"
Oh!
Don't worry.
With all that studded buried.
It will be some Rear Admiral than lather with the wind speed.
Wrong for the day in question.
Ah...when did I mention.
It's at Whitehall.
The Ministry of War.
"We few, we happy few, we band of brothers."
"For he today that sheds his blood with me, shall be my brother."
But he is a responsible police officer.
I can't interfere in this matter.
And what do you think?
Will he let you go scot-free if I tell him?
"That I am his friend, doesn't mean that I have bought him out."
"Ifyou haven't done it yet, do it now. I am with you."
Meaning?
"Here's 1 ,OOO,OOO in this bag."
Tell me ifyou think the price is less.
There is no price for Vijay.
My friend is priceless.
You can't buy his honesty.
Not even for 10 million.
My friend is a man of principles.
Amazing!
He is the first lawyer I have seen in my life whose hobby is to fly an airplane.
Flying isn'tjust an hobby for Ravi.
It is his life's first romance.
His first love.
Tell me something.
- Go ahead.
"Even you must have had a first love, hadn't you?"
Yes. I did have a girlfriend.
But why do you ask?
Just nothing.
Was she in your college?
-Oh yes.
In college...in my class.
What was her name?
The name was...
Meenakshi.
Meenakshi Chatterjee.
Just a thought.
I think it's time you take this to a higher power.
You got nothing to say?
Nope.
All good.
Father Bardini says he hasn't seen you in months.
So much for the seal of confession.
That's only inside the box.
Good to know.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
You had your reasons.
I didn't want you in the middle.
"Oh, honey, when it comes to you kids and your father,"
I'm always in the middle.
How bad is it gonna be?
Do you remember the time you and Stevie painted Richie purple?
"Oh, damn it!"
You didn't ask his advice.
You joined Internal Affairs.
And don't swear in the Lord's house.
I didn't think I had to ask his permission.
How long have you known your father?
It was my decision.
Do you want him to forgive you or not?
For becoming a detective?
For living my life?
Sorry.
What do I do?
Bake him a cake.
Chocolate.
A cake?
Seriously?
"Dude, rule number one; we will stop calling her ""girl."""
Really?
Why is that?
"We used to say it before, what happened?"
Things have changed.
Watch your mouth if you don't want to mess up our mood.
What are you saying?
"Dude, we barely convinced him."
Take it easy.
"Okay, fine."
I won't say anything.
We're blessed.
What's up with your hair?
Tie it up.
Hey 3012 Mert.
"Sir, I give up."
"I've forgotten the way of the school, but... you haven't forgotten my school number."
Do you really know all of our numbers?
"Shut up, you ill-mannered wretch."
Sure I do.
"This is 6024 Sinan, 5947 Kaan, 6813 Gamze, 5018 Uluc."
Fix your tie.
Well done!
"Let's hope for the best, sir."
You were a businessman; what happened?
What happened with your job?
"I took a medical report, sir."
I'm on holiday.
"We'd better go to our class, sir."
"As you know, the bell has rung."
Really?
Are you serious?
- See?
- Oh...
That's... clap!
"One, two, three, four, five battle."
Alright tardy cake!
"- No, you're first!"
- You are... no.
You do this and...
Hey!
Look who's here?
We just saw your stupid little girl friend.
Had to tell about herself.
You should see her face.
Just this mornin' we got to whack a couple of clowns.
"Yea, we took our time doin' it too."
Your stupid little girlfriend looks scared than both those faggots put together.
Even when things are getting up before them.
Step aside jail-bait!
Or don't!
If you wanna be a tough guy and see what happens to you.
"Do it, do what they say, Daisy."
Can I ask you fellas something?
"- Nah, forget it."
- Come on.
Excuse me?
Please.
- Everybody!
- Please.
Very good!
But I won't get into it until you holster the hardware!
- Why would we do that?
- So you don't get tired.
we can book an open fight.
that's when we're all gonna get paid.
Hell yeah.
That's what I'm talking about.
- Cheers.
- All right.

Where's your punk friend of my sister's?
Huh?
How would I know?
I'm gonna ask you one more time nicely.
I told you-- l don't know.
all right? I don't have anything to do with your beef with Brandon.
Shut up.
Shut up!
Tell your friend to stay the fuck away from my sister.
You understand?
- You understand?
- Yeah.
You make sure he gets the message.
You got that?
clean your tools ever?
Can you hand me a socket wrench?
is this it?
What is this?
Does this look like a socket wrench?
I don't know what that is.
wrench.
It's a socket wrench.
How about I just sock you with this-- this giant hammer?
I thought you were sweet when I met you.
You want to make me a sandwich instead?
Empty.
Empty?
- [exhales] - [horns honking]
It was all that waiting I had to do for youse.
I'll run down the street to the gas station and get some gas.
"Boy, oh, boy."
You guys are costing me a lot of dough.
I sure hope you make the tip worth it.
Something's going to happen to someone near here.
We've got to help.
"No, I think you'd better stay here and wait for the driver."
I'll go.
I think it came from back that way.
Be careful.
And remember what Uncle Bene said.
That is enough.
Bring him down!
"[victor] sickle, turn to your right."
Balance yourself
And walk along the ledge.
"[Letha] Victor, no."
Stop.
I'll bring him down myself.
Give that to me.
[wires crackling]
Look what you've done.
[exhales sharply]
"Sickle, stop."
"Sickle, I'm commanding you to stop."
"Sickle, this is Dr. Victor Gannon commanding you to stop!"
- He's out of control.
- [Letha] sickle!
"A little too friendly for me, apparently."
"Uh, never mind."
Her name is Audrey.
All right.
Audrey.
Got it.
- You good?
- I need a favor.
My father isn't sick.
He's been faking his illness.
Why would he do that?
That's what I want to find out.
Why not just ask him?
He left the country.
With Emma.
"Look, there must be someone else that knows about this."
"His... his bodyguard, Donnie, I've left him messages."
"So far, nothing."
I'll see what I can do.
All right.
Hang in there.
How often do you see an escort?
Once a month or so.
I just started doing this.
"Uh, I got a raise at work."
The dating pool is depressing.
It's full of boys in skinny jeans and baseball caps.
"It's hard to find, like, men."
Women are like wild horses.
"You stroke 'em, put 'em at ease."
Whisper in their ear.
"In my experience, the more high society they are, the more they like to be manhandled."
That was amazing.
You think?
Yeah.
You know everyone right?
Yeah definitely lovely ladies of LA of course and Seven how are you?
Much better now that you're here how are you?
Good.
Hey...
How are you doing?
Ah I'm gonna go to the bar.
Anybody want a drink?
You guys want to join?
I'll stay.
So can you get me another Jack and Coke?
Yeah sure.
Ok.
Hey...
Hey where did Dale go?
Oh she went to the bar.
Oh well Cece this is Hallie.
- Hey.
I didn't get a chance to introduce you guys the other night.
"No you never did, nice to meet you."
Same.
Oh this is my girlfriend Dominique.
So um when are you practicing tomorrow I want to hear the new song.
Cece works in AR for our tour manager.
So everything's got the thumbs up from her.
I'm easy.
I mean not that kind of easy you know.
But with a voice like his you can't do much wrong.
"She's cute, I say go for it."
Go back to sleep.
"It's all right, Bobby."
It's all right.
Go back to sleep.
We're here together.
I think we could all use one of those.
Mr. Gordon?
Shall we go into the other room?
Let's go.
Get started on the clock.
"Stan and I had a brother, Bobby."
He was younger than either of us.
Not quite 7 when he died.
Stan and I were 12 and 14.
We lived in a big house with grounds that bordered a river.
"That particular day, our mother asked us to stay at home and look after Bobby."
We wanted to go swimming.
"What we wanted to do, Bobby wanted to do, naturally."
He idolised his big brothers.
"So we told him to stay in the house, and off we went."
He followed us.
We were pretty far out when we spotted him.
He was trying to...
To get to us.
He still is.
- You mean it's his...?
- Spirit?
Ghost?
"I don't know, Mr. Gordon."
"I do know that often, when Stan and I are together, this happens."
And you believe?
"It happens, Mr. Gordon."
I could give it up for the right guy.
"Oh, that came out wrong."
What I mean is...
"I would, you know, stop hooking if you wanted me to."
"I mean, there is lots of pans with pancakes out there, right?"
I think I'd like that.
Mr. Reznik.
"I am sorry, I thought it was somebody else."
You gave me such a scare.
What are you doing in my apartment?
There is a leak in my ceiling.
It's coming from your apartment.
That's impossible.
I was going to leave a note.
A note?
What kind of note?
About the leak.
What's that terrible smell?
There's no leak in this apartment.
Now if you will excuse me...
"- You're sure you're alright, Mr. Reznik?"
"- Yeah, I'm sure."
"If you need anything, please call first."
Miller.
Miller!
"Hey, Reznik."
It's a pleasant surprise.
We need to talk.
"Take a look at this, huh?"
"Picked it up at Grossens, top of the line."
"Hey, let's not trim anything for a while."
I need to be doing something.
You call me a bear?
!
Relax...
See that he doesn't move.
Sit down there!
"What's up, sir?"
Do you know him?
Who is he?
I could tell you.
But you won't believe me.
"Of course, I will!"
He's Laxmi's husband.
Her husband?
!
No!
I can't believe that!
But you just said you would!
He says his name is Banwari.
And you said her husband's name was Durgaprasad!
"Have I told you that, too?"
Are there two husbands then?
Not two husbands.
The husband has two names.
Laxmi fondly addresses Durgaprasad as Banwarilal.
I wouldn't know where to begin.
All right.
Brother's in deep shit.
"He's down, he's bleeding, and you gotta get there."
"But there's lights, right?"
"All over the city, red lights."
You go through the red lights.
"Sure, you fire up the roof, you wail, you go through the red lights."
Made right.
- Made right?
- Orders from the fleet.
Take your hands off me.
You mutinous filth!
Don't think you can soon be forgiven.
- It's not easy.
- Mr. Scott-Padget.
I would advise you to say no more.
You're compounding the offence!
You're in it with them!
Your friends will be dealt with.
"When their lordships hear what I have to say, you're done."
You're under arrest.
You've done for us all.
What's it matter?
You all wanted him dead.
You're as bad as him.
"And between you, you've finished all of us."
Give me a knife!
Get back!
"We had everything, and he took it from us!"
- Let's go.
- While the fog's thick.
"They're right, Vizard."
I want no sound.
We're gonna weigh anchor and make sail.
- Weigh anchor.
- Quiet now.
Anchor aweigh!
Set the courses!
Course west-sou'west.
(grunting) And here's baby boy number one.
I understand you've decided to name him Stewie.
One more to go.
And here he... oh.
"Oh, dear."
"Oh, no, did Dave not make it?"
"Okay, Meg, I've cleaned your room and I did your homework."
Can I be done now?
"Oh, no, there's a lot more things"
I need you to do for me.
There are?
Like what?
"Well, now you have to watch"
An Officer and a Gentlemen with me.
And that's it?
(laughs) No.
"At the end, when Richard Gere carries Debra Winger out of the paper mill, you have to read what's on this index card."
(on TV): ♪ Love lift us up where we belong... ♪
(crying)
"That's going to be you some day, Meg."
I know it will.
I just know it will.
"Okay, Chris, I want to wear contacts, but I'm too squeamish to put them in myself, so you need to help me."
Really?
Is it that hard?
My eyes are too sensitive.
It's like they overreact or something.
Okay.
"Ah, what happened to your eye?"
!
Don't worry about it.
Just put the lens in.
"- I'm so frustrated, Claire."
"Give him an ""I want sex"" look."
He'll think something's in my eye.
You have to generate heat.
"Sometimes, I swear he feels it."
Men aren't that bright.
It's easy.
"Be subtle, mysterious, seductive."
"Subtle, mysterious, seductive?"
Why don't men come with instructions?
- More coffee?
- Thanks.
My tickets just arrived.
My first lecture is in Paris on the 24th.
I leave Saturday.
- Do you want an English muffin?
"- No, thanks."
- I'm off.
I have an early class.
- All right.
Have a nice day.
"- Oh, by the way..."
- Mmm?
Would saying now that I want sex tonight be enough of a warning?
Or should we wait till you come back from Europe?
"Yeah, that's better."
"No, no..."
That's fine.
All right.
I guess I'll see you tonight.
Have a nice day.
- Have you ever tried making love?
Let me know when it is.
"- Bye, Parfitt."
- Mrs. Cole.
Shall we find the lady who'll do our makeup?
I suppose so.
It's coming over.
Mind your heads.
Cigarette?
That's it.
"Okay, line it up, please."
Line it up and keep it straight.
That's it.
I've never much seen the point in men.
"Still, I do hate to see you pining."
"Oh, I'm not pining."
Ellis moved out weeks ago.
I'm already used to it.
It wasn't Ellis I was thinking of.
Forgive me.
It's just that...
"When we were shooting in Devon, you always seemed so... vivid."
Perhaps I'm just in a sentimental mood.
My landlady was killed yesterday.
I could hear her husband crying through the wall all night long.
"It seems to me when life is so very precarious, it's an awful shame to waste it."
I was wondering.
"On page 76, I say..."
They're getting worried.
About the ending.
Turned Ministry spy now?
Is that it?
Could I...
Okay.
"Here... you can hold me if you want, mama."
"Oh, hell, no."
Try not to move.
"Can you pass me that, please?"
This?
Thank you.
What the fuck?
It is the fastest way.
Does it look good?
"You gonna look hot, mamita."
"Yo, wait till you see this place, E."
It's like an amusement park.
They got like a butcher shop in there.
They got a club in there.
"Yo, they got these like plush brand new seats, kid."
I don't even know how they play baseball in there.
It's like a hangout.
"What's up, bro?"
"What the fuck are the chances, bro?"
You should see the way this nigga walks around
Waving his arms and shit.
"That's wild, B, but come on don't worry about it."
"When Angie was pregnant, right,"
She had this...
"Um, they did the thing, you know where..."
Sonogram.
"Yeah, sonogram."
"They told me it was a boy, I was like wow."
I gave that nigga my name.
Enrique Michael Rodriguez.
"That's my name, son."
Not too bad.
"It was like the Walt Disney version of the ho chi minh story, but other than that, it was terrific."
What have we got?
Anything exciting here?
"Also, you got an invitation."
What's this?
Dinner at the white house.
You're kidding me.
Is it a big party or something?
Just 5 or 6 people.
"Thursday, huh?"
Far out.
Girl:
"Hi, mom."
What did you do today?
Stuff.
"What's that mean, ""stuff""?"
"Well, me and Sharon played a game in the backyard, and we had a picnic down by the river."
That sounds fun.
You should have seen this man came along on this beautiful gray horse.
Really what kind?
"Was it a mare, a gelding, what?"
I think it was a gelding.
It was gray.
It was so beautiful.
The guy let me ride it all around.
"Oh, that's nice."
It was so nice.
"Oh, I loved it."
"Mom, can't we get a horse?"
Not while we're in Washington.
"We'll see when we get home, ok?"
Come to our house to eat.
She's right.
You ought to quit being such a stranger.
"Now, I'd like to propose a toast."
- To Vince Hardy.
- The best Captain of Homicide ever.
Vince Hardy.
How about we drink to my mother?
"She was a Hardy, too."
"And Jimmy, let's drink to him."
It'd be fitting here by the river.
Uncle Vince is dead.
"They're dead, too."
Drink to Jimmy!
- That's enough!
"- No, It's not enough, damn it!"
- Let go of me.
I'm all right.
- You don't belong here.
"- Me and you, Eddie."
- Anytime.
The best day of the year.
Better than Christmas!
- Are these policemen all relatives?
"- No, they're just criminals."
How did they end up on the force?
"Part of some nationwide negative gene pool, I guess."
"- Don't do that, okay?"
- What?
That thing where you're not really talking to me.
- That's not the answer.
- It'll do till the answer turns up.
You know what I like about rich kids?
"Bam, nothing."
"Hey, Ryan, you wouldn't consider me rich, would you?"
I'd be more upper middle class?
"What's up, fool?"
"You know, you didn't have to hit him."
Sorry.
"You know, the cashier called the cops."
"Look, I don't know why Luke does that."
Did that.
He's just...
An ass?
Protective.
God.
It's my mom.
And... your dad.
It's been awhile.
Figure out what kind of shape this place is in.
Wow.
Oh.
That's what...those contractors have been doing.
This place is fantastic!
You think so?
You don't think it's too much?
Too much?
You're talking to the guy whose wife just imported ceramic shower-curtain rings from Morocco.
This is gorgeous.
The high ceilings and the molding.
It reminds me of...
Your parent's house.
On Elm Grove.
"Yeah, with the vaulted ceilings and those great beams."
"- Yes, please."
"Er, forgive me. it's been a long time since I've seen anything like that."
"Oh, I wear this to hide it."
"It's so ugly, you know."
- And may I ask which camp?
"- Jadwiga, Poland."
It was long ago.
I am sorry.
Don't be sorry for me.
"Because Saul and I, we survived."
But it never ends.
Now they got Saul again.
"Now, Lena, we'll get him."
Don't worry.
When are your people coming in?
I'm not sure.
"Tonight, tomorrow."
They don't give you a schedule.
But they will try to contact us at my house.
Rick's working on that.
Calls to your number will be switched here.
- How does he do that?
"- Illegally, I'll wager."
He has connections.
"Tommy, you still have to take me to my home."
"Lena, we have been all through that."
I don't have any clothes.
"Nothing, not even a toothbrush."
- I'll get whatever you need.
- You don't know what to get.
I'll bring a little bit of everything.
"Tommy, my personal stuff."
I'm getting on that train.
What are you going to do to him?
Shut him up for good after I get the diamond.
"Now go on home, wait for my call."
"All right, but be careful."
MAN ON PA:
"Your attention, please."
The return portion of tickets purchased in the East require validation before boarding your train.
Validation desks are located adjacent to the stationmaster's office.
"Oh, I'm awfully sorry."
"Hi, sonny."
"Oh, don't you touch me."
I'm not going to touch you.
You leave me alone!
"But, sonny."
(GROANING)
I'm not going to hurt you.
You're not?
Of course not.
"Oh, then will you buy me a ticket, please?"
"No, I think you should let your daddy buy you a ticket."
(WAILING) I want a ticket!
Buy me a ticket!
I want a ticket!
(EXCLAIMS)
What are you doin' to the kid?
"My uncle won't buy me a ticket, and I got the money."
I hate goofs who pick on kids.
Goofs?
Goofs!
"I hate goofs, too."
Then buy the kid a ticket.
~ Sorry.
~ Dawson pawnbroker.
"A chance to get yourself a decent suit, John."
She died of leukaemia.
Left me her watch.
"~ I'll be with you in a tick, gents."
~ Thank you.
"What was your gran's name, son?"
Er...
I just called her Grannie.
I would've called her Glamorous Grannie.
This is a Rolex.
"Look, I-I just need the money."
"I'm sorry, son."
Mr Dawson has very strict rules about these things.
"I'm not sure that this really belonged to your gran, may she rest in peace."
"~ What are you trying to accuse us of, like?"
~ Being stupid.
~ How are you today?
~ Champion.
I'm sorry about the smell.
"The working stiff normally has all my sympathy, but this set of work-shy bastards, I could crucify."
I've got rats.
"We'd like to speak to Mr Dawson, please."
He's not in at the moment.
Perhaps I can help you?
Are you buying or selling?
Ah.
There is no Mr Dawson.
It's just a name I can blame when I have to say no.
"People can get, erm..."
What's the technical word?
That's platinum.
"Oh, no wonder it looks so different."
"Well, there's nothing wrong with your watch, sir."
"You have 11:00, too."
"Yeah, but it should be five minutes past eleven."
"I always set my watch, you know, five minutes fast."
"You know, you're always racing against time 24 hours a day."
"Excuse me, sir, are those men members of your crew?"
"Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
They're with us all the time.
Good.
I think I'll have a word with them.
Thank you very much for everything.
"Excuse me, sir."
"Lieutenant Columbo, LAPD."
I wonder if I can have a word with you?
MAN 1:
"We're gonna have the hotel in the shot, right?"
MAN 2:
Everything.
"On the master, right?"
"In the master, right."
Okay.
This is where...
He comes up right here.
Can I ask you this?
What now?
This is just the way we discussed it.
This we do on stage...
"This is on stage three, right?"
Right.
Sounds good.
Wait.
That's it?
What do you want me to say?
I get it.
Man has a satellite.
Doesn't want anyone to know.
"Yeah, but..."
"I am about to go to war with New Bern, Kansas, the home of the nearest Costco."
Today is already just about as weird as I can handle.
I'm not asking any more questions.
"Mom, Dad, there's a chance we may have to leave here today,"
"and we might not be able to make it back, so I just wanted to..."
We just wanted to pay our respects.
Remember I told you about that witch from the IRS?
The one that wanted to take everything you've ever worked for?
"Mom, Dad, this is Mimi."
Hello.
It's nice to finally meet you.
I really love your son.
"And,of course, Bonnie is... she's just wonderful."
And I've really enjoyed living with them and...
"Oh, great."
What?
I didn't say we were living together.
We're not married.
Oh.
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I certainly...
I...
You see this button?
She controls her own dosage.
"Friends, family, career, future..."
None of these things matter to her now.
This is the face of 21st-century drug addiction.
Satisfied?
$25 million.
$30 million. $35 million.
"Ladies, you're off my grid."
I've lost visual of you.
You were right.
It is a cabal of evil florists.
We found Finch's flower patch.
If we connect this to the sprinkler system with the rest of the greenhouse...
We can wipe out every damn flower in here.
Go get Amanda.
I got this covered.
Got it.
"Guys, I got eyes on Bosley, but audio contact is dead."
I'll lead you in.
Something's wrong.
I'm losing power.
Who the hell are you?
No sign of Amanda.
Abby?
Eve?
Don't move.
Turn around.
Turn around!
The last offer I heard was $35 million.
Who wants to get real?
$50 million.
Thanks!
We might have a chance at winning now!
Bridon!

"Dad, I was just messing around."
I drove by the school and saw kids on the playground doing a music number and you weren't there!
You're here in the sports gym shooting basket hoops!
"Hey, your kid is really good at this."
"Don't talk to me, stupid jock asshole!"
"Just go easy on him, huh?"
You know what this means?
!
It means you're about to get slapped.
So you better shut up!
"If he wants to play ball, you should let him."
I'll do it!
I'll slap the shit outta you!
He's just a kid.
You don't tell me how to raise my son!
I'll slap it again.
"Dad, stop!"
You're trying to turn my son into a little asshole sports person like yourself!
"There, there's another slap."
Maybe you'll think next time you act you---
"Slap it, I slap it!"
"Ow, Dad!"
"Dad, you're hurting me!"
"Shut up, Bridon!"
"Uh, what's going on here, Mr. Gueermo?"
"Get outta my way, Mackey!"
And don't worry.
We totally redo the paint.
In a color of our own choosing.
"Yeah, whatever."
I'm easy.
"Hello, Carl."
"I too, am Carl."
"And this is my son, Carl Jr."
We are all Carls.
Neat.
"Yes, yes."
Remove his brain!
I wonder if you can get the whole thing in your mouth.
"Hey Meatwad, how's the job going?"
"Um, just okay."
"Carl washed his car there, didn't he?"
"Yeah, but..."
But what?
I'm having some reservations about this work.
And some nightmares.
Nightmares?
"There was a time in my life when I thought dancing in front of the car wash would be the only thing I'd ever want to do, but the way these people wash cars..."
I just don't know anymore.
"Well, Carl seems happy with it."
Is he licking it?
"Yeah, he's been doing that all morning, I'm afraid."
"You know, snakes -- in the wild, of course -- have to unhinge their jaw to eat a car."
I think the trouble with you is that you have all that skin around your mouth.
Shake!
What?
He's doing it!
Carl?
Doctor?
Mrs. Brown.
Is he...
You saw for yourself.
Your husband needs help.
I advise you to place him in a rest home as soon as possible.
Hello?
"Harold,"
I'm afraid I can't talk to you now.
It seems that John is much worse than I thought.
"Sure, I heard."
He's mad as a hatter.
"Well, aren't you the busy little man?"
"Oh, hello, darling."
"Isn't lunch time, is it?"
It's 1:15.
And you said 1:00.
"But if we hurry, maybe there'll be something left."
Good heavens.
I had no idea it was so late.
How's the new line going?
"Oh, fine, fine."
Where would you like to go to lunch?
How about the Royalty Room?
I'm afraid I have to be back by 2:00.
I have an appointment with the manager at Tilfords.
"I, uh..."
I want to persuade him to take on our contour chairs.
"Darling, is anything wrong?"
Nothing to worry about.
It just takes time.
But I am going to put on some new salesmen.
We put a thank-you note on the sleeve.
There you are.
What you doing?
Puttin' me name on the sleeve!
Telling King Gob here I gave you the hand!
"Why not take an advert out in ""Loot""?"
"""Moz supplies body parts""!"
"- Shit, man!"
Where'd you get it from?
- I found it in the kitchen.
End of story.
How can it be end of story?
"I mean, whose hand is it?"
The one a bloke killed over the road.
Mrs Slocombe dragged the hand in.
OK?
"Three little words, Moz?"
999.
Three more.
"Fuck off, Kuldip."
"I didn't want the police here, so I gave it to Sonny and Cher."
- Nobody's gonna believe this.
"- No, 'cause you're not telling anyone about it."
The four of are gonna keep the whole thing under wraps.
There's gonna be big posters of it everywhere.
The record company's giving us a big push.
"I'll give you an even bigger one in a minute, knob-head!"
We could all go to prison for this.
Not me!
I'm not involved.
I've got me records to think of.
"- Hey, d'you need any remixes done?"
"Well, yeah, you know."
"I wanna be a doctor, but I gotta get into college fiirst."
What kind of doctor ?
Pediatrician.
I like kids.
- Do you have any ?
- No.
Do you ?
"Oh, I didn't-- l wasn't trying to be smart, Derek."
Wouldn't be the fiirst time.
"Screw you, I'm brilliant and cool."
"- Oh, yeah."
- Yeah.
Wow.
"That was cute, that little thing you did."
Can you show me again ?
- What was that shit you just did ?
- Rond dejambe attitude.
- Ballet. I used to dance.
- You used to dance ?
"Used to, as in don't anymore and no, I don't want to talk about it."
"So, is that why you brought up that rond dejambe attitude shit... because you don't want to talk about it ?"
It's really not a big deal.
I think it is.
"This club was so slamming, Lindsay, the dancing. I'm gonna go again."
You are ?
"Well, have you seen anybody get shot yet ?"
What ?
"No, I didn't see anyone get shot yet."
"God, I didn't move to Bosnia."
"Well, I'm still going to pray foryou."
"Jesus, Sara, you're in the freaking ghetto."
Dear Max
I'm thinking of you.
And I'm writing you some things that I can't tell you.
Can't you still?
Did you realize that it's not the same now?
We don't love each other anymore.
That's what the letter said?
Nothing else?
Did it say something about me?
Yes.
Tell me.
Tell me!
Can't you say those things about me?
You've never wanted to know them.
Well now I do.
What do they matter now?
!
To me they do!
Tell me!
Stop it!
You're hurting me!
Then tell me!
You're nuts!
That's what you think about me?
No.
That would be so easy!
"Besides, you'd take that as a compliment!"
I don't want to say what I think of you because it doesn't matter anymore!
Would you like to live in the countryside?
Always.
I'd stay here.
I couldn't get used to it.
You heard him.
"Thank you, sir."
"Hey, Em!"
You wanna take a ride?
Come on.
Can I go?
"Yeah, of course."
Go with your father.
She's an amazing girl.
This way!
Move this way!
Welcome aboard.
"Thank you, sir."
You sure you're all right?
I'm all right now.
"Good job, special agent."
"Thank you, general."
"If you ever want a private tour of the White House, just let me know."
I can hook it up like that.
"I mean, maybe in a few weeks.."
when we've got the place back together.
That's good to know.
You wanna give him the news?
Calls have been coming in from all over the globe for the last hour.
"The presidents of Iran, Russia, Israel and France have all agreed to your terms."
It looks like your peace plan is a go.
"You keep this up, I just might have to vote for you."
You wanna see something really special?
Yeah.
Carol.
"Henry, the president wants to do the thing."
Hold on tight.
Plums out of her damn orchard.
"Come on, call her up."
"Well, I guess I should get back."
Unless you want me to take the rest of the day off.
"No, go ahead."
I'm doing much better.
It was a big help getting out of the house.
"I really should have taken the day off,"
"Too, it wasn't for... what do they say?"
... pressing business.
"I know, Jeff."
I don't mind.
"As a matter of fact, I think I'm going"
Back to work myself tomorrow.
Are you sure you're not pushing it?
"No, it'll be better at work."
"Now, hurry up, 'cause you're late."
I'll finish my coffee.
Come on by tonight?
JEFF:
Yeah.
OK.
OTIS:
"Yes, Ms. Ramsey."
"Like I was telling Richard, during the Depression,"
I used to ride a trolley for a nickel all the way out here
To the end of the line just to steal
Fruit out of your orchard.
[Chuckles]
I bet you were one of the boys who I took a pot
Shot at with my slingshot.
"Well now, what's on your mind, Detective Burris."
"Honestly, I think only about me and my work."
"Do you like stars, up in the sky?"
Stars?
I've never really thought about them.
What makes your life difficult?
My mom.
She makes things the hardest.
There's no end to it.
She's ruined everything for me.
And I hate her the most.
"I really hate her, but she's still my mother."
- Director Kim.
- Did you get some rest?
"Yes, a little."
I'm sitting on the stairs looking out at the sea.
There's a lovely tree in the garden.
I'm having sushi in the restaurant next to that grocery store.
I've ordered too much for myself.
Would you two ladies like to join me?
I love sushi.
Won't you feel uncomfortable with us there?
"No, come."
Come and enjoy the food.
"Okay, I'll be right down."
It'll take about ten minutes.
"Alright, I'll be waiting."
You haven't changed.
You're not going for a walk?
You're all ready.
But I don't want to go today.
Really?
"Then, take a rest."
This is Max and he isn't the groom.
"No, no, no."
He's single and gay.
Yes.
"So gay, he got kicked out of One Direction."
Why don't you two walk off somewhere and share poignant coming-out stories.
Go.
- But Max--
"- Oh, you heard the women, go."
Can do.
"Ladies, look around, we'll be back... in about a month."
Tahiti anyone?
I'm just Crazy Carl.
The ladies love it.
Bridesmaid's dresses should be called what they are.
Really expensive donations to Goodwill.
Is this one bad?
No.
That's a Vera Wang.
But this is a very wrong.
Hide it.
Ew.
And it's evil twin.
"Oh, I didn't know hazmat suits came with feathers."
Oh my God.
This the worst thing I've ever seen.
And I've seen a prostitute change her tampon on the sidewalk.
Who are you calling a prostitute?
"This, we've got to hide."
I can't get this dress off.
Just tell it you work at Google and you're thinking of settling down.
Lift it up.
Get Inspector Robin to protect me tomorrow.
Yes Sir!
"Darling, go buy me an ice-cream!"
I want you to apologize to this lady.
"None of your business, I like it when he hits me!"
I still want you to apologize to this bitch.
I know you'd be checking the view here.
I've got a great scheme for us.
Hang on. I want his apology.
"Just say 'sorry', out of pity for him."
I never have to say sorry!
That's true!
"Come on, let's go...!"
No way.
He has to apologize!
He's lnspector Robin!
Inspector Robin.
"Oh, I'm sorry!"
Don't bother with me.
Apologize to the bitch.
Sure thing.
"Sorry, bitch!"
I beg your pardon?
Let's go!
Who the hell's lnspector Robin?
Great...
Shame on you...
What do you want from me?
"This scheme will benefit the human race, lt will benefit the entire world."
But how will it benefit me?
"You can be the greatest unknown hero,"
But how will it benefit me?
"- dang. jake ain't nothing but a paintballer -- no future and currently dead, by the way."
"kind of sad, though."
he didn't shoot blanks.
- [gasps] you're useless!
"- geez, i was just having fun."
i'm gonna get a refill.
[door creaks]
- you guys seen randy?
[toilet flushing] excuse me.
"oh, my god!"
ohh!
what is that?
- it's pizza with a hint of hard-boiled egg.
- that's disgusting.
- i don't know whether to be grossed out or hungry again.
"- okay, you have serious problems."
"look, have you seen randy?"
me and him are supposed to hook up.
- no.
- have you seen randy?
- excuse me.
y-you can see me?
"- well, yes."
"if you're standing right there, i can see you."
- what?
no. no.
how did that happen?
- have you seen him or not?
"- i, um -- no, i haven't."
"- have another drink, why don't you?"
- i think i will.
[knock on door]
Get back!
"Move, move, get out of the way!"
What's going on?
They're under the ground!
Look out!
They're under the ground!
"All units, all units, be advised."
Air support en route to Pine Street Park.
Multiple explosions reported with severe casualties.
Bomb squad on scene.
"Oh, this does not look good."
You were actually near where...
"Yeah, no, it was just right there."
Was it over here?
- The south side.
- Okay.
It was just huge.
- You saw it yourself?
- Yes.
What kind of explosive makes a crater like this?
Something small.
An I.E.D. maybe.
Looks like he used the grass to hide them.
Land mines.
Holy crap...
It's Paxton Petty.
He did this before in the early '60s.
"In the past, there were multiple occasions."
He's not finished yet.
So you know this case?
Three bombs went off.
"He claimed there was a fourth, but it was never found."
Politics took care of that.
Same goes for flags.
He doesn't even weave them.
"Still, he designs them."
"He's part of the process as geopolitics, seamtresses."
"No more, no less."
So artists are vessels?
He asked me to be his assistant.
- Doing it?
- I don't know.
It's a tough decision.
Afghanistan is far.
Make it to Nepal?
Kabul was the end of that trip.
We had to get back.
Why?
Is it a secret?
"I brought my drawings... to the editors of ""Parapluie. """
"They have a band called ""Fille Qui Mousse""."
They want collages for their light show.
Waste of time.
Isn't there better to do?
Like what?
Like your paintings.
"You're starting out, like me."
You have progress to make.
I don't have much time.
I prefer to draw.
You're wrong.
I preferred your paintings.
Will you show them to me?
I'd rather not.
"- Well, that's..."
- l'll get my stuff.
Okay.
Should I?
Do we have...
You take a second.
You go ahead and eat.
I'm still trying to find where everything is in this house.
"Oh, congratulations, by the way."
Thank you.
"Have you guys set, or maybe you haven't..."
"- Oh, May 1 2th."
"- Well, that will be beautiful then."
Thank you.
"I need to get ready myself, actually."
"You don't need any more, do you, Jessie?"
"- Oh, no."
- Here you go.
"- Hey, you."
- l'll be down in a couple of minutes.
"Jess, you almost ready?"
"Yeah, I just have to get my things."
I can't get him to tell me what's going on.
- He's hiding something?
"- l think he's terrified, ashamed, and he doesn't want me to worry."
But he's not hiding something.
I don't know.
You're the one who thinks he's been a criminal the whole time.
- You said you didn't trust him.
- l didn't trust him emotionally.
You don't get sent to prison for that.
"Oh, God."
Stop!
It's none of your business!
You'll get hurt!
I told you!
You'll get hurt.
You traitors mixed the two factions.
"No, we haven't."
"Actually, they're the same style."
"Yes, you just haven't realized it."
Kung-fu is no fixed motion!
It's endless!
Go!
Stop!
Stand back!
They're geniuses to have mixed the two factions.
I must kill the two traitors!
"Brother, they set a good example."
We shouldn't kill them.
Fung-wu's master and Jun-kit's sister were killed by us so that we could learn their styles.
"They taught us, so they're our masters now."
Release them!
- Brother!
- Your Highness!
- He's a monk now!
- He's a monk now!
Master!
"Yan-ling, behave like a girl!"
"Master, I wish to go to the restaurant with you."
Go then!
What are you talking about?
Nothing!
What did you say?
Come on.
We do all right.
Love In The Afternoon.
Eh?
"Well, it'll be a big photograph of the choir and the Halle."
"And will we be allowed to, like, buy one?"
We will.
"Did they say how much that photo's going to be, Mr Kirkby?"
"It's got to be four or five bob, hasn't it?"
A big cardboard job.
"Well, I wanted to get one for Mam."
She'll have your school photo.
"No, she didn't get it."
"See you Saturday, Mr Kirkby."
Oi!
Eccles cake.
The labourer is worthy of his hire.
"Thanks, sir."
Bye!
And...
How come?
Mr Kirkby give it me.
"For carrying all his hymn books, because you know he's religious, so he has to carry hymn books, but he can't because of his leg."
Carry them.
"If I only had one leg, I'd put a wheel where my leg was."
"Would you, Mam?"
Put a wheel where your leg was?
I'd put a motorbike.
Get me to work quicker.
# My Christian name is Enid
# My mother is to blame
# She wanted something nondescript
"She was just a bit lazy, you know?"
My mother was beautiful and I didn't want her to let herself go.
- What did your father say?
"- Nothing, what could he say?"
- Is he dead?
"- Heavens, no."
He's living in Sweden.
"I guess, because..."
I haven't heard from him in ages.
- Doesn't he come to see you?
- No.
"He formed another family a long time ago, when he left my mother."
We're not in touch.
Why have you come to see me?
Well...
What's your problem?
Me?
None.
You must have one if you've come to see a psychiatrist.
"Loneliness, I guess."
Have you had sexual relations with a woman?
Or with a man?
No.
I'd like to see you next week.
Am I not well?
"No, it isn't that, but..."
Your adolescence was what we might call special.
- It wasn't that special.
- It was.
Very special.
"Well, whatever you say."
And we should analyze it more deeply.
Go.
Move.
Come on.
They went this way.
You sure?
"Birds fly away from danger, predators."
Dawkins is making a fast pace.
"He's snapping branches, he's kicking rocks."
"The Apapanes didn't like it, one of them sounded the alarm call, off they went."
Down here.
Come on.
"Please, can we stop and have some water real quick?"
All right.
One sip and then we go.
"Come on, come on, come on."
They stopped here.
"No, don't do that."
Molokai's rainforest's got pathogenic microbes in the water that'll put a man down in an hour.
"Judging from those tracks you found, looks like they drank from it."
They won't get much further.
"Come on, Tarzan, now we got an advantage."
Who told you to stop?
"- Please, something's wrong."
"Come on, move."
- We don't feel...
- Move.
Move.
I can't get a clear shot.
Dawkins.
Come on.
Come on.
Move.
What's going on?
Jenna?
Sweetheart.
"Oh, honey."
"Sweetheart, what's the matter?"
"All right, come on."
"Come on, just come in."
"Oh, sweetie."
"You'll be fine, sweetheart."
- Jenna?
"- Hey, it's me."
- Hello.
- Is she there?
Anna?
I'm coming over.
Please don't tell her.
"I know I'm being such a pain in the ass right now, but I had to come and see you."
- Hi.
- Hi.
"I know you're like, ""This girl's a freak, get her away from me,"""
but I have something for you.
Don't you want to know what it is?
"I made you, like, the best mix CD ever."
"I mean, there's a ton of stuff on it."
Like some really cool Madison bands that I'm sure you've never heard of before.
"And, like, the first song that we danced to."
"And there's also, like, this song of me playing the flute which you're gonna think is totally God-awful."
But I thought it'd...
- Kim.
- What?
There's something I have to tell you.
There's something I have to tell you.
- Did you bring back my photo?
"- Oh, no."
I'm not done with it yet.
I'm still in the brainstorming stage.
"Well, if you get stuck, you should enlist Michael."
He's got creativity just rolling off of him.
"Yeah, I always work alone."
I'm a solo artist.
Of course.
She's still brainstorming.
Yeah.
It's like this complicated process that-
"So, tell Ellen about the shoe guy."
Did you go back to the store?
Yeah.
And turns out he's a killer of children.
"So, oh, well."
What?
"Why does he say ""the tall one""?"
- Because he wants me to do it.
- He's crazy.
You'd leave teeth marks all over it.
You'd choke on it.
He could see that I have a sensuous mouth.
This is crazy.
Someone should call in the authorities.
"Obviously, I would do it better."
We need an impartial authority.
"Hey, Peter!"
Peter Swersey.
"We are going to giveyou a ""jimmy ha-ha."""
- Do you know what that is?
Thi-I saw the name on the list.
And I checked the profile Thi.
Max students.
"I thought I would stop at the airport, but not verified."
I expect you to believe.
After all that happened?
"Would you like Dave, But I tell you the truth."
- Who are you?
- Do you think I'm going to say?
Try .. quiet!
Everyone to calm down.
Who are you?
If you say ...
My friends would be in danger.
And my family.
And we?
I had a sister.
Thi does not matter.
Crazy fool!
How many pro like you were there?
Asshole.
Do you think I get involved?
"Max, if you want us to believe, You have to prove who you are."
If you do not want to tell us and then show us.
Empty your pockets!
Now!
And passports.
Take out of pocket ...
Tell the truth.
Are you happy now?
Stupid stupid!
Enough for now.
- Mom.
You know exactly what Daddy wants.
And you know how to make him happy and how to make him miserable.
Every woman does.
"If you're bored, Mom, you know, that's your fault, not his."
Bored.
"You've always been your father's daughter, and if you want to side with him this time, that's fine."
"- This is not about sides, Mom."
- Don't!
"Don't pretend that you know what goes into a 30-year marriage, because you don't have a clue."
You don't have a clue.
Are you all right?
I'm sorry.
I don't want to upset you.
"Can we have some chamomile tea, please?"
- Hello.
"- Hey, it's Michael."
"Hey, Michael!"
I've been thinking about you.
Really?
What kind of thoughts?
You know exactly what kind of thoughts.
- What are you doing?
- I'm at work.
"Yeah, I'm trying to picture it."
Where's your office?
It's Zander-Cohen.
It's a pretty big architecture firm.
Impressive.
Do you have a view?
Yeah.
It's a nice view.
This is it.
Someone must have knocked this over.
No!
It's not here!
No!
It's not here!
My engine!
I've just completed it!
It's gone!
"Please stay back, Mr. Mac Bain."
It's too dangerous.
The engine was just completed?
No...
It can't be.
The efforts of a lifetime have been...
We understand how you feel.
"Mac, please get a hold of yourself."
"Chief, one of our fire trucks has disappeared!"
That's impossible!
Keep looking!
I made some hot soup.
"Please have some, it'll make you feel better."
You're welcome to stay here if you'd like.
Thank you very much for your kindness.
"Oh, dear, I don't think you should give up just because the engine..."
No!
There's no hope whatsoever.
It's all over!
Your wife is correct.
"I think it's too early to give up, Mac."
Spare me your empty words of comfort.
"I am giving you no such thing, sir."
"Oh, well, this is just great!"
That didn't go so well.
"I'm not pointing any fingers, but do you ever put that thing on vibrate?"
- Good morning.
"- Yeah, right."
"Dad, Dad, Dad."
Come on.
"We can either discuss this as adults, or you can act like a child."
"""...or you can act like a child."""
Which is it gonna be?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Ike Cortez.
Manhattan Monthly.
- Alex Rose.
"Well, let's dive on in."
Feel free to ask me anything.
Great.
"Okay, first question."
You work for your dad.
Does that ever get awkward?
No.
Never.
Next question.
"If there's one guy Alex Rose could date right now, who would it be?"
Don't you have anything on there about hobbies or something?
I don't care if you're seeing him!
I just want to know what's going on.
Really?
You don't care if I'm seeing him?
"Well, of course I care, but I can't come barging in here yelling"
"""I have mixed feelings!"""
I always think of it as sleeping resting up from the pounding it takes during the day.
- Do you work at night?
"- Yes, quite often."
You don't realize the preparation it takes to be a teacher.
It's like... .
It's like all these kids were my own.
I love them.
I want so much for them.
"It's more than a job to you, isn't it?"
I didn't mean to sound like the dedicated idealist.
"Well, there's nothing wrong in that."
Connie.
- I did want to thank you for coming.
- You don't have to.
I enjoyed everything.
Including the dancing?
Including.
"You're wasting your time, Mike."
I had my love a long time ago.
"And when my husband died, I came back here."
And I've had no time for anything but Allison and the dress shop.
- You've got time now.
- It's too late.
"- Look, Connie."
If I were...
- I said it's too late.
I made my choice long ago.
Please take me home.
Sure.
"Selena, let's get married."
You mean now?
Sure.
Please follow me.
I swear with my sincerity.
"Sir, do you know the accused Ho Foon?"
No.
But he is like my concubine Yu-fa.
What?
You have had a son with your concubine?
"Yes, we have a son named Nim-sai."
But he is dead.
Why?
I don't know.
Why don't you know that?
We've lost each other for over 20 years.
Why did you say he's dead?
I saw his dead body.
How could you confirm that was your son?
From his ass.
Ass?
"Right,"
I saw a triangular birthmark on the body's ass.
That makes me believe that was my son's dead body.
"Sir, there are so many unexpected things happened on earth."
"For many things, you may not believe it."
"Foon, do you want me to teach you?"
Take off your pants!
Now!
Yes!
How about the one I saw?
"You just saw his ass, but not the face."
The birthmark may be drawn by someone.
It may be drawn by someone.
So you are my son?
I thought you were sleeping.
What the hell?
Yanking up your daughter's skirt in the middle of the night?
"Speak, will you?"
"Tell me, asshole!"
"Tell me, you fucking shithead!"
Fuck you!
"Stop staring, motherfucker!"
Don't call your daddy that!
Don't you look at me!
Stop it!
Daddy said he was sorry.
I'm gonna kill all of you.
How could you?
I met the shaman today.
He thinks there's a spirit in the house.
Something's possessed Hyo-jin.
"And if we don't act, there'll be dead bodies."
He's supposed to be the best.
Why didn't you answer my calls?
"Come with me, and don't give me any crap."
Ask him where he stashed the stuff from in there.
The things in there... where are they now?
What things?
He asks what things.
The stuff we saw before.
Things we saw... before.
The photographs?
You mean the pictures?
"Yeah, the pictures."
And the other stuff.
Yes.
I'm scared.
There's no reason to be.
Everything's okay.
I could have been a better person.
I could have done more.
You did enough.
Stay with me.
It won't be much longer.
I'll stay right here.
- Let me see.
- I think I singed my eyebrow.
I need to see.
You thought it was a good idea to put kerosene in your barbecue?
- I thought it was lighter fluid.
- It doesn't look burnt.
I'll check for corneal burns with an ultraviolet light.
I need everything documented.
Worker's comp.
- You're a chef?
- It was my summer office party.
"Oh, I don't think that counts."
Any word on the air conditioning?
- Yeah.
They think it'll be fixed by winter.
- I can't work like this.
- You want a Big Stick?
- No.
- Why did I buy these shoes?
- Because they were cute.
- Some help here.
"- Yeah, what is it?"
Car rammed into a picnic at Lincoln Park.
Did you measure the closet?
- Yes.
Did you measure the door?
- Damn!
"Listen, if it's storage you're after, you can put it in the hall closet downstairs."
Let me go and get the door for you.
"All right,here, keep it sideways."
"Uh, Dubcek, hold it."
- What?
"I got it, I got it, no problem, no problem"
Hello?
Yeah just a second.
"Harry, for you."
Hello.
Wrong number.
She took it down herself.
"Ah, it's all right."
"You had the guts to get up there, you know?"
It takes time.
I have to be funny by tomorrow night!
You're not gonna make it.
I don't know what to do!
"Well, don't over-think it, you know, just, talk about things you know."
That's what I do.
Yeah.
You make fun of your poor mother's flabby arms.
"Hey, those flabby-arm jokes made her the most popular senior in Fort Meyers, Florida."
"You.. you mean, she doesn't hate you for it?"
Hate me?
No.
She loves me for it.
It's a joke.
We're supposed to have dinner with Judge Maynard and Timmy.
"Yeah, okay, as soon as I finish this level."
"No, get your coat on."
It's a three-hour drive to that cabin.
Can't you just cook something here?
Excuse me?
I am not going to cook you dinner while you sit here in your own mess playing your TV games.
"Oh-ho, and the martyr returns."
"Chris, I..."
I think it's time for you to go.
"Okay, I'll go."
"But I want you to know,"
I faked all my light-headedness.
"Mm, good Kool-Aid."
"Whoa, whoa."
Sound familiar?
"Oh, my God, Chris."
"Oh, there you are."
I've been looking all over for you.
Why?
You want to humiliate me with more slave work?
"No, I..."
I wanted to apologize.
I should've never blackmailed you.
I'm really sorry.
And I want you to come home.
I thought you said no one would miss me?
"I said a lot of stupid things I didn't mean, Chris."
But I miss you.
"Thanks, Meg."
"I miss you, too."
"You know, living in that family, we both have pretty crappy lives."
Fitzgerald?
"Whoa, easy."
Where did he go?
Who?
Fitzgerald.
Where did he go?
I have no idea.
Tell me or I'll take your head off.
I swear to God-- (GROANS)
Tell me.
Tell me!
Texas!
He said he was going to Texas.
He said he was gonna reenlist.
Then he started talking about property.
"""A decent piece of land."""
One.
One of the same people.
"Oh, one."
So one's okay.
We just let off one nuke at the Super Bowl.
"Oh, so now you want to micromanage something that you didn't even want to be involved in."
"I don't want to manage it, but don't you think we could maybe find someone competent who could?"
"Okay, whatever it is, I don't need to know."
I'll tell you what's going on.
"Jonah saw Moyes earlier today and Dan and Amy have, too."
And now Moyes is onto us.
Why did you just tell me that?
This is so much worse for me.
I was the field agent who gave Dan and Amy the mission.
I was the messenger.
I could be shot.
Mwah.
"One of our classic forehead smooches, just like I planned."
This is weird.
- Should we have sex?
- What?
- Huh?
- Yeah.
"I mean, no."
"- No, things aren't weird, or no to the sex?"
- Maybe we should just--
- You're right.
"Just concentrate on Figgis, and we'll figure this out later."
"- No, I was gonna say maybe we should talk, but yeah, it can wait till after Figgis."
- Ah.
- We have the rest of our lives to talk.
"- Yeah, unless he kills us first."
What a weird joke.
Regret saying that one.
"Wow, things are clickin'."
- I'm gonna go make sure there's enough balls in-- in the ball pit.
- Yup.
Important to get on them balls.
What is wrong with me?
"- So then Trevor sends me a text, and he's like,"
"""At this point, I hate you."""
"I'm like, ""Oh, really?"
"'Cause you didn't hate me last week."""
- Trevor sounds like a dog.
- Right?
"God, I missed our daily dishes."
- Me too.
"I'm sorry I'm not reciprocating with ""hot goss"" of my own."
- I'm okay.
What a weirdo.
"You were scared, weren't you?"
The room's a bit cold.
Is it alright?
What about your friend?
Doesn't matter.
She likes me a lot.
And I don't like it too warm anyhow.
"Tomorrow, bean sprout soup."
Okay.
I'll make some delicious soup for you.
"Ah, what a day."
"Tired, huh?"
"Whenever you have time, you can stop by anytime."
Just come and rest in our room.
I'll play really nice songs for you.
"Oh, my!"
You've drunk so much all by yourself.
"I've come by myself, you see."
Why?
What about your companions?
I came alone.
That movie director came by today.
That man you came with last time.
Should I give him a ring?
He's probably too drunk.
"He came with another woman, you know."
"I began talking to him, and he said that woman resembled you very much."
- He said she looked like me?
"- Yes, that's what he said."
"I mean both of you are pretty tall, but you're far more beautiful."
It's what marriage is all about.
I know.
I read it on the back of a matchbox.
"Basil, sometimes..."
"Seriously, Sybil, do you remember when we were first... manacled together?"
We used to laugh quite a lot.
"Yes, but not at the same time, Basil."
That's true.
"That was a warning, I guess."
"Should have spotted that, shouldn't I?"
"Zoom! ""What was that?"" ""That was your life, mate."""
"""Oh."
That was quick.
"Do I get another?"""
"""Sorry, mate, that's your lot."""
Basil.
Back to the world of dreams.
"Yes, dear?"
What are we going to do?
Give it another 15 years?
- About the money.
Do you...
"- Aw, she's left it in her room, or eaten it or something."
We'll get Manuel to go through the room.
Polly can check the lounge...
- I saw Polly with money just now.
"- Well, there you are."
"Quite a bit, too."
She was counting it in here.
"Well, it's probably hers."
"No, she's been very short lately."
I'll ask her...
–Beauty.
You got the address?
"–Yeah, sure."
"–Oh, geez."
–Corrine...
Don't run away.
Just hear me out for two seconds.
"Look, this running has to stop."
How much time could you possibly need?
"This isn't about me, Vic."
"It's about our kids, about them being safe."
Do you honestly think I'd put my children in danger?
"Not intentionally, but the things going on in your life..."
Something told me to run.
School's back in session.
Matthew needs to be at Glenridge.
He needs his routine.
Cassidy needs to see her friends.
This isn't gonna change things between us.
Don't punish them because of me.
"I'll move out if I have to, if that's what it takes."
But I need to know that they're at home where they can be safe.
I don't...
"I don't know, okay?"
I'll think about it.
"Hey, how'd your meeting with I.A.D go last night?"
Good.
Good.
You ran out of here so quick.
They told me not to discuss it with anyone.
But it went fine.
Anything yet?
He was here just now!
You'll be dead if I catch you
This is such a small place
Where can he hide?
I'm here!
"You bastard, you bastard!"
I'm so mad!
"Gao, how come you're so slow?"
I'm coming!
Coming!
You will have it for sure
"Y es, I'll be right there!"
"Gentlemen, take your time!"
Coming!
That way please!
"Gentlemen, have some tea"
What would you like?
"Whatever is good here, we'll take it!"
"Y es, yes, will be right here!"
Hurry up!
Just get whatever dishes here
"Anyway, we can eat as much as we want"
When we get to the home of Thunderstorm!
What're you rushing at?
Brother Y an is really smart
He can turn the home of Thunderstorm ...to be his own camp
What about Shi Zhengzong?
That coward
Of course he won't dare to fight back!
"Come, a toast!"
What happened?
You messed up again!
We have an eyewitness that saw him dump a body.
- Even you said it was a cop.
- I said it could be.
Now we have a witness that said it wasn't.
"- Dad, let's go in."
"- Sit down, I'll be right with you."
Go ahead.
Sit down.
I'll be right in.
I don't want any problems with you.
Do you understand me?
You should be glad we caught him.
Where is he?
"They're going to throw the book at him, Nick."
Your son or not.
The criminal court of Pennsylvania is now in session.
The sentencing for the State versus Detective Jimmy Detillo.
The Honourable Judge Hellen Kramer presiding.
"- Mr. Gunther, where is your client?"
"- We don't know, Your Honour."
Jimmy...
"Son, listen to me."
Listen to Daddy.
We'll talk to them.
We'll work something out.
Mama went off this bridge.
You remember?
They never found her.
"Jimmy, you don't have to do this."
"Cops don't go to prison, Dad."
I don't go!
Are you gonna give him a push?
You've created a life for yourself and a totally new path.
It's wonderful.
"I wish you good luck, Michael, and hope you visit us soon."
- I will.
"- Goodbye, Michael."
"Boy, you really knocked it out of the park in there."
I quit.
Seriously?
- Oh!
How'd it go?
- Great.
I quit.
Can you give me a ride to the airport?
Sure.
- You quit?
- I'll get my things.
"I didn't get what you meant at first, about me being afraid of something else, but I get it now and I know what it is."
Did you plan all this?
involved...
"Well, there was a certain amount of planning"
"No, it was instinct."
He's good.
- He's like a brain detective.
- What was the epiphany?
I don't wanna say it till I know I'm right.
I guess this is the end.
Of?
Therapy.
"I mean, you got me where I needed to be."
You literally drove me there.
"Well, therapy's never really over, remember?"
"Well, not for me, maybe, but..."
- Philip!
"- Stay away from me, you murderous..."
"- Philip, no!"
- Tell him you did it for him.
I did it for you.
She was going to destroy you.
Have you fired.
"Your own daughter, that's how much you loved him."
My daughter.
"I killed her for, for you."
My savior.
My Siegfried.
Please don't leave me.
What would I want you for?
Look at you.
A mad cow.
Philip!
Phil...
Philip.
What's gonna happen to me?
"- Come on, Gillian."
- Who's gonna look after me?
It'll be the taxpayers of the state of New York who'll be taking care of her.
She's only got three years left to live.
"You're not gonna throw the book at her, are you?"
I'm sure she'll be receptive to a plea that lands her in the Bedford prison hospital.
You think any of those tears are for her daughter?
"Yeah, me neither."
"Um, did I not mention to you my new philosophy?"
Of saying yes.
Does that mean you want me to...
That was a f unny thing to say.
What was the matter with it?
He fell f or it.
Yes.
He f ound it easy to believe.
Martinelli's beach house fronted on the Gulf.
A big place he'd probably built with hot priorities and cold dice.
"All right, get out, quick!"
- Did they go f or it?
- They said they'd send a police car.
What time have you got?
Five to 9.
Hello?
Hotel Southern?
This is Mr. Murdock.
"Give me the manager, will you, honey?"
"Well, this was gonna be it. lf l got that letter, it was all I needed."
"If everything rolls on rubber, I'll be at your place by 11."
- Can't I wait down the road?
- No.
This is Operation Solo.
I don't want you hurt.
"By the way, where is Surf 3181?"
The penthouse at The Gables.
"You won't take any f ool chances, will you?"
Not any f ooler than I'm taking now doing that.
- Be caref ul.
- Sure.
It's funny how loud crickets sound and the way you feel.
"Funny, too, how a kiss stays on."
The way you can still taste it.
Martinelli was still up there.
"Buy yourself some new sandals, and a round of mouthwash for the table."
"All right, place your bets."
I placed mine on a liberal arts degree.
That's why I'm here.
Let it ride.
"Max, maybe we should quit while we're ahead since we've never been before."
Aren't you worried that we might... 18 again!
Keep winning and never die!
Let's go with four.
The number of men who have flashed me since I've been on this riverboat.
Lucky four!
No more bets.
Whoa!
Who's driving this thing?
Gary Busey?
"Oh, four."
No winners.
"Yes, winners."
"We had four, but then the boat moved our chips."
"Yeah, and it also spilled my soda."
So like I said:
No winners.
"Sure, we lost all our money, but at least you got to see some dongs."
"Hey, Sophie, it's me Car... ah!"
I fall for her...
"""Hello, this is Sophie"""
outgoing message every time.
We need them to send that money.
"Oh, thank God."
"Hi, Sophie, it's..."
What's going on here?
Are you selling pony rides with Chestnut?
See who dares call me Fat Pig in future!
Fat Pig!
- Get him!
- Yes sir!
"Oh, it's you who made this sound?"
"Don't look at me, look at the glass."
"Yes, a spy needs to be very secretive!"
So you're Fat Pig?
"No, but I know a Fat Pig is eyeing my 'Beast'."
"So I got you to uncover him, and I found out."
So you've set me up!
"I told you not to look at me, look at the glass!"
What if there's no glass?
Then look at the ash-tray.
- What if I look at the vase?
- lf you like!
Where's the 'Beast'?
- ln my head.
- What?
"The 'Beast' is the formula for an atomic bomb,"
"Meant to have a deal with the American, but got chased about."
So I got you to help me close this big job.
"Oh yes, big job!"
Can you see it?
Very clearly.
- Does it look good?
- Looks great!
You're still looking at the good view?
"Not any more, only at the menu!"
Lucky you!
Why?
"That's what happened to me, stared at the good view too long."
Well...
We won't give up.
We'll just keep looking.
"Today, tomorrow..."
"Oh, not tomorrow."
The race is tomorrow.
"Well, Roger's more important than the race."
"Oh, Thomas, you know, I get this feeling down deep in my solar plexus... that if you really try..."
I mean really try real hard... you can win this race.
"And if you win, everything will be okay for Roger and me."
"I mean, the police will find him and... and he'll give back the money and we'll get married."
You know what I mean?
"Yeah, I know."
Beauty Knows No Pain.
Yeah.
?
Beyond the reef?
?
Where the sea is dark and cold?
?
My love has gone?
?
And our dreams grow old?
?
Someday I'll know?
?
She'll come back?
"Remember, this is your best event."
So don't go saving your energy for the other events.
Got it?
Yeah.
Don't forget.
"It's, um, hip."
"Or whatever the word for ""hip"" is now."
Yeah.
"Yeah, no, it... it works."
"I, um..."
I work here.
"Or I used to, before..."
I am starting again next week.
I'm sorry.
"I wanted to come back, but I just..."
"I couldn't, uh, get it together."
That's my fault.
"And then, your mom said that you weren't ready to... see me, so..."
Mom told you not to come?
She has her reasons.
I missed a lot.
But when I saw on the news what happened with your... with Piper...
We don't...
We don't have to get into that.
Being a survivor is painful.
Having to remember all of your friends' faces...
This isn't...
"I'm fine, honestly."
I need to ask you this one thing.
Anything.
I understand that you and Mom couldn't make it work.
I get that.
"Sometimes, people just don't fit together."
"And, now, I know what you went through with Piper."
"The lies, all of it."
I understand why you ran away from this place... but...
(TAKES DEEP BREATH)
"No, no."
Nobody did anything to me.
I just...
I'm trying to keep it spicy with Tim.
"Honey, I didn't even know people could do this, and I've had some long layovers in Bangkok."
- Mom!
- I'm sorry.
"This is a little more than I could handle, so, I-I..."
I think I'm gonna talk to my therapist.
Do you think that he can help me?
"No, no, this is for me."
You need a priest.
(car engine approaching)
(car door closes)
HEATHER:
I got this.
I got this.
(keys jingling)
I don't got this.
I don't got this.
I don't got this.
I don't got this.
(beeping) What?
"Did you know that Victoria's Secret sold their Web site to someone called ""Net Nanny""?"
"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey."
Will you go get me a glass of water?
"I can smell Pop Tarts, so I know Tyler's in the kitchen."
"Look, I cannot keep doing this."
"If I wanted to run up and down the stairs two times a day, I'd join a gym."
You're gonna have to talk to him again at some point.
Maybe not.
"Maybe like a mama bear out in the wild,"
I do not hit on your mom.
You always kiss her on the cheek and try to make her like you.
"You're like, ""Oh, that dress is just perfect for the season!"""
Why does your voice always get higher when you do an impression of me?
That's her.
My heart is racing.
I need that stress ball.
You can do this.
Stay calm.
Don't let her get to you.
Do it for Anna-Kat.
Do it for me.
"Okay, I can see I lost you."
Do it for Anna-Kat.
Okay.
Relax.
There's no way she can make an entire family Thanksgiving about herself.
"Oh, God."
She upped her game.
Happy Thanksgiving.
"I'll just take this heavy bag upstairs, then."
- All by myself.
"- Okay, great."
Be careful of that clicky elbow.
What happened to your mom?
Absolutely nothing.
She is looking for attention.
You didn't ask?
She could be really hurt.
"Oh, please."
That thing isn't even bolted into her head.
- I should go help her.
Yeah.
It's good woodwork.
- That's this place.
- Full marks for observation.
Mm-hmm!
Yep!
"Alright, there we go."
Ah!
"- Oh, shit."
- What's up?
I just forgot I don't have my phone.
"I keep going for it, I forget it's not in my pocket."
"And there's, uh... no TV here, so..."
Welcome to the 19th century.
"No TV, no Internet, no wi-fi."
Yeah.
No wonder people were seeing shit.
Probably were just bored out of their gourds.
"Well, that's the leading theory about ghost sightings."
The mind plays tricks when less stimulated.
"Fewer distractions, people saw more ghosts."
Isn't that a nice piece of info?
"Well, they got literature, though."
"That's pretty sweet, right?"
"Oh, my God, I can't remember the actual last time that I read a book."
To think people used to do this on purpose.
I know.
Crazy.
Why?
"- You know, I don't think I've..."
"- Shh, alright?"
I need to get into some old-school shit here.
What the hell?
Stay where you are!
"Wait, we're trapped in the house."
Stay where you are.
The pair of dead bodies inside.
"Our friends, okay."
Blair.
"I'm sorry, she does that when she's scared."
Everybody down on the ground now!
Do it.
"Officer, you're not listening to me."
"This man is a murderer, okay."
He killed both of our friends.
That's a lie.
"Just do what I say, and we'll sort this out."
Sheriff.
"I couldn't say anything before, but, they've been holding me hostage, and they're robbing' my house."
That's a fuckin' lie.
Don't believe him.
Everybody shut up!
You will talk only when I say so.
Is that clear?
"Officer, you gotta listen to me."
Shut up.
"Take these, cuff yourselves to that post right over there."
What about him?
He said shut up.
You shut up.
"No, you shut up."
Everybody shut up!
"Let me take care of him, all right?"
Just do what I say.
"No, I'm fine."
I'm fine.
I know exactly what I'm doing.
"OK, but we could really use your help with the new mosque, and we were hoping that you'd changed your mind."
Yeah.
It's just that I can't do something I don't believe in.
"Well, you obviously haven't totally lost your faith,"
- You're eating turkey bacon.
- The thing is...
- Ah!
Spit it out!
Spit it out!
- What?
You have lots.
It's not turkey bacon.
Sorry.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
[ sigh ]
That's wine.
Kidding!
[ sigh ]
Stupid answering machine!
"Where are you, Charles Thorne?"
"Guess who had bacon this morning, real bacon?"
- I did.
"- No, I did."
I've finally took that last step away from my old life.
"Sarah, I love you, but your religious crisis is getting in the way of my real crisis."
"Well, then I guess you don't want half my BLT."
"Hell, yeah!"
Less dork... more pork.
This one looks more like a prison than a mosque.
But this time it's totally about the crying.
So he showed a little emotion.
Girls are supposed to like that.
I do not need the chase.
"Bella,you're a control freak."
You love a project.
"To you,an ambivalent guy is like a poorly organized closet."
I don't...
I don't want ambivalence.
I want to be adored.
Johnny's great.
The guy touches my face.
You know how many face-touching guys are left out there?
I hope it's a similar amount to the number of hand-washing guys.
"Good morning,my love!"
"Dude,just sack up,already."
Geez!
I saw it.
It was fine.
It was cute.
Whatever.
Excuse me.
Gotta go to the office.
Later.
What the hell did you do to this thing?
Were you hanging from it?
Nothing.
I don't know.
It's old.
- You had sex right there.
- Shut up.
- Right where your father is.
I stopped at Krispy Kreme donuts.
That's it?
.
"No, that's not it."
The hot light was on.
Feel these things.
They're practically radioactive.
"Please, don't ask me for details about Scott."
"Oh, I'm not going to."
"He's totally wrong for me, he's unpredictable, and his neck smells better than that bag of donuts."
"Apparently your hot light is on, as well."
"But if you don't want to talk about it, I'm certainly not going to probe."
I know you're a very private person...
- Sit.
- You are so easy.
Would this be the same Scott you kissed the other day?
The one your dad detests?
"Hmm, yep, that's the one."
Sleeping with the enemy.
I'm not sleeping with anyone.
And such a shame.
Like a Maserati up on blocks.
"Oh, it's my dad."
"When I left work today to sneak out with Scott, I told him I was coming down with something."
"Hey, Dad."
Sorry my voice is all...
"Yeah, sure, I'll hold for him..."
"Hey, Dad..."
"Yeah, a little."
"Yeah, I know."
A lot of fluids.
Okay.
- He hates you.
He hates you.
- Getaway from him.
Getaway.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
"Lucy, did you hear me?"
What?
I asked you if you were upset because Bruce left.
Am I ever gonna get out?
Are you getting sick of me?
What I'm getting sick of is Fish-Stick Fridays.
"You will be leaving at some point, yes."
But our sessions don't have to end.
I would like to be a regular part of your life.
What life?
- Lucy.
"- No, no, you don't understand."
I know what my life should look like.
I know that I should be in school and starting my career and going on dates and making out in inappropriate places but I'm never gonna be able to do that.
I have something for you.
Torts.
Funny.
"You know, that's what drove me crazy in the first place."
That book didn't cause your psychosis.
Law school didn't cause your psychosis.
Didn't help.
Why did you wanna be a lawyer?
There's no time.
"Gemma, run, please, go!"
Fuck.
She could... s-she could've cut us free.
"Tools, weapons."
We-we could have fought.
We could have run away.
"You can't run anywhere, babe."
"You did well, Luke."
You showed guts.
"Oh, you keep it."
You're in the family now.
I trust you with it.
- What if someone finds out?
"- Trust me, Luke."
We're some distance above the law.
Once this is all over... we can just disappear.
Lie low while my father's people deal with these loose ends.
Your father knows about this?
This whole business has shamed him more than anyone else.
My duty was clear.
Restore family honour by any means necessary.
- What?
- I knew he had my back.
He doesn't want to lose another son.
"Did you send the postcard, El?"
No.
- Did you?
- No.
Glad we got that cleared up.
This is the last leg.
You're almost there.
These children are dangerous to us.
also to their own selves.
We can't cure it.
"Therefore,"
"I have to tell you... that we've decided for their sake, to lock them up indefinitely."
Benigno!
David!
Stand up.
Where's Anais?
Let's go!
Anais didn't make it.
But we save a child.
Your child.
Don't move!
Make them wear it.
Tell them to wear the safety clothes.
I can't eat slowly when I eat hot things.
"If you eat it, will you die?"
Eat it quietly!
"Son-in-law, it looks like your food is too hot for you."
Would you like to drink some cool beer?
Beer?
Why not?
"Sure, sure."
Would I die if I drink it?
!
"Dad, he has to drive later."
"Da Ran, I don't have a car since the accident."
"Yoon Jae, your body is still not well since the accident."
I think I will sleep well with just one drink.
"Please pour it for me, Father-in-law."
"Dad, Dad, me too."
Don't run away.
Just hear me out for two seconds.
"Look, this running has to stop."
How much time could you possibly need?
"This isn't about me, Vic."
"It's about our kids, about them being safe."
Do you honestly think I'd put my children in danger?
"Not intentionally, but the things going on in your life..."
Something told me to run.
School's back in session.
Matthew needs to be at Glenridge.
He needs his routine.
Cassidy needs to see her friends.
This isn't gonna change things between us.
Don't punish them because of me.
"I'll move out if I have to, if that's what it takes."
But I need to know that they're at home where they can be safe.
I don't...
"I don't know, okay?"
I'll think about it.
"Hey, how'd your meeting with I.A.D. go last night?"
Good.
Good.
You ran out of here so quick.
They told me not to discuss it with anyone.
But it went fine.
Anything yet?
- Hi.
I'm Detective Wagenbach.
- All right.
Just a second.
"- Bob, the police are here."
No.
Old things.
Clothing.
"Hey, he's at the salvation army."
"Nah, they don't got stagecoaches at the salvation army."
"They don't got gold, neither."
"Wait a minute, wait a minute!"
We had one of them nothing school trips.
To the museum.
"Yeah, they got a pile of gold."
And a stagecoach.
They had to kick me out.
We've got to go there.
"Come on, it's over here."
[kids grunting]
[indistinct chatter]
[tires screech]
"Now, Tony."
We're going to create a little diversion.
The stagecoach.
I want you to roll it all around the museum.
[woman gasps] [woman] look out.
[man] watch it.
"[man] watch out for that thing, it's coming this way."
"Hey, where are the horses?"
I...
Don't know.
Now cause total chaos.
[man] watch out.
[yelps]
Short circuit the control system.
[control system buzzes]
I don't care!
Fine!
Do whatever you want!
Why did you come back?
Leave me alone!
Chun-su.
What do you want?
I looked into the tax collection in the village.
"In all, we've paid over 70% of our harvest in taxes."
I bet there is not another saltern city in the country that paid so much!
I'm going to...
Give it up!
Chun-su...
What's this going to change?
Will it bring my father back?
Don't make me in a difficult spot and give it a rest.
Chun-su...
"I don't want anything to do with this, so give it up."
Soon-shin.
Mother...
Where are you going so early?
What are you up to?
And what's that written in that book?
Mother...
A friend's father is dead.
"And if I don't do something, my friend may not be safe either."
But this isn't something you can resolve.
I know.
"I know what's scaring you, Mother."
But I have to do this.
"If I don't, I'll never forgive myself."
Soon-shin!
Introduce yourself!
Pleased to meet you.
We got off on the wrong feet.
I didn't know who you were.
"Brother, I have a little party going at the back gate."
Come wet your whistle.
I'm on duty.
I have to guard my prisoners.
Come on?
Are you afraid they'll break out of here when they're barely clinging to life?
Let the new kid watch your post and come with me.
I shouldn't be doing this...
"Oh, it's all right!"
"Kid, stay right here and watch the prisoners."
You got that?
"Chun-su, Chun-su!"
"Chun-su, wake up!"
Water...
Water...
Here.
Here's some water.
I'm sorry...
I caused to you and Chun-su...
"No, it's not your fault."
Baron Huh did this to us.
This is what I get for twenty years of loyalty.
Isn't this pathetic?
But I will not go down like this.
"Baron Huh, that bastard, I will kill him if it's the last thing I do!"
I hope I'm not asking too much of you.
Don't mention it.
Chun-su isn't just your friend.
Why are you laughing?
I'm sorry.
"This sounds silly, but I was just thinking..."
How could I marry someone that I've never even...
You know...
Oh.
Kissed.
There's one thing I have to say.
I promised your sister I wouldn't.
"You love Claire, too?"
You just slept with her?
- You want to?
- I don't even know her.
It's about how I found you.
I wrote this ad...
I think that's kind of great.
- I thought you'd be upset.
- Why?
You picked me.
"Actually, I found you through this charming woman on TV..."
"Well, well, well..."
Ha...
So?
Gregory just proposed to me.
Do you need a Valium?
"I know you don't respect my opinion, but I don't trust him."
"I mean, where's the attraction?"
He's not attracted to me.
He doesn't want sex.
He wants to be companions.
What sane person would agree to that kind of marriage?
It's not natural.
I think... cleaning's overrated.
There's still hot food down there to eat.
There's something really truthful about this waiting... and doing the whole job at once.
"We're gonna use up all the dishes, and then it's time to clean."
So you want to talk about it?
Not really.
Hallie call?
No.
Call her?
And say what?
I haven't done anything.
I do.
I'm not a housewife.
And I found fleas in the bedroom.
You mean my pets?
"I think fleas are people, too."
And... they should be treated as such.
Those are my pets.
And you're going to kill them?
Are you a murderess?
"Seven, what do you think I should do?"
Be honest.
"Well, I've been honest."
Not with Hallie.
With yourself.
"Sorry, babe."
I cannot give you any more advice on this one.
Just take mine!
And you put on... your...
"You know, if Vanessa has a problem with it she should clean that (bleep) up."
"Hey, it's Dale."
"Listen, Hallie, why don't you just call me back, please."
Fine.
He thinks I'm paranoid!
"I should bring him the helicopter, then we'll see how paranoid I am."
"Come on, let's go inside."
"- Yeah, it's gone."
- I don't hear anything.
Let's go back to your mother's.
- They all right?
- Beautiful.
They're great.
"Didn't I tell you, you were paranoid?"
Didn't I tell him?
Yeah.
I need a hit.
Want to see helicopters?
"Come on, I'll show you helicopters."
"I've seen enough helicopters for one day, thank you."
My plan was I had to get home and get the package ready for Lois to take on her trip.
"Also, I had to get to Sandy's house to give the package a whack with quinine."
"Plus, I knew Sandy would get on my ass."
"Then I had the cooking to finish, and I had to get Lois ready for her trip."
- It's Sandy.
What is this?
- She's a pain in the ass.
- When are you coming over?
- In an hour.
"- You staying tonight, right?"
- I can't.
I got my brother tonight.
"Come on, stop."
"We'll talk about it later, okay?"
Goodbye.
Lilly do you want to come with us?
Oh yeah that'd be great.
"Pizza and a movie, that totally makes up for making me."
Throw away the college of my dreams.
Just 'cause of your miserable stinking secret!
But you said you were okay with it.
I am.
"I just said I wanted to go, didn't I?"
"-Yeah, right."
-Yeah come on you must be starving.
And I can't wait.
To just go out there and get ripped apart by an angry mob of Hannah fans!
Yeah but who cares about us.
As long as Little Miss Center-of-the-Universe is happy!
-It's always about you!
-Always!
-You!
-You!
-You!
-You!
[Echoing]
So who wants to drive?
Will you stop it?
Come on Lilly just come out and say what you're really thinking.
Well I was thinking:
who wants to drive?
And now I'm thinking maybe I should.
I'm not talking about who's driving.
I'm talking about the secret!
You both hate it and you hate what it's doing to your lives!
Just admit it!
Everything would be so much easier for you if I just told the world who I was!
-What are you looking for?
-Where is that box you used to keep all my stuff in?
- The memory box?
- Sounds about right.
I don't remember.
I'm kidding.
Excuse me.
"Oh, God."
Look.
First place.
The trophy was bigger than you were.
"Can we speed this up, Ma?"
I need my medical records and my birth certificate.
All right.
Here.
"How about your report card, huh?"
You could have been valedictorian... if you hadn't been suspended so many times for getting into fights.
- I never could figure-
"- Mom, I don't need my report card."
- Your father used to get so angry.
- I don't want to talk about Dad.
- I just need my stuff.
- Fine.
Here.
All right?
-I don't want you to think you're keeping those.
"-No, I'm just gonna make copies."
I'm gonna take a trip.
Work.
"The last time you said that, you left for 10 years, Michael."
It's not that kind.
"Did you ever think about leaving, Mom?"
Is your phone broken?
Or your thumbs?
"Ok look, we're on the list."
Here you see that?
Let them in.
You tot's owe me Seven.
Nice natural looking good.
Ah uh Brett Michaels is waiting down over there and you darling
Sunset Strip is that way.
Dude.
This chick has the biggest tits you've ever seen.
"Hey, Jamie did her and said she was wild in bed."
"Jamie, bro you don't want his sloppy second are you kidding me?"
They call him herp for a reason.
"Hey, check out the old dude and the cougar."
Sweetheart I'm sorry there's been some kind of misunderstanding there you go.
Tom how many times do I have to tell you
I only date girls 25 and younger.
I'm sorry...
Oh my God is that David Spade over there?
He's hot.
God this town is so disgusting.
"Oh my God, check this guy out."
That's the producer I met the other night.
He is so hot and well connected... oh.
Out or my way...
Uh oh...
Don't look over there.
Oh you've got to be kidding me.
I'm going to go to the bathroom.
I'm just...
Skank!
- What?
"Is it timeless, or is it likely to go out ofstyle in the next 20 years?"
I would say it's a new classic.
But 20 years is a long time.
I think everything's gonna be computerized in 20 years.
- Soup won't be computerized.
- Why not?
It's a liquid.
"Dude, did you just give her the family discount?"
Yeah.
She's my neighbor.
I'm trying to work on my karma.
- Doyou know what karma means?
- Yeah.
It means that she owes me one.
I love you.
I'm not following you.
My car's parked over there.
- In Smart Park?
"- No, on Front Street."
"Oh, I parked in Smart Park."
"So, at the end of the next block we'll separate."
At Tyrone Street.
"Yeah, the ""Ice Land"" sign is halfway."
It's the halfway... point.
Ice Land is-
"It's kind of like that point in a relationship, you know... where you suddenly realize it's not gonna last forever."
"You know, you can see the end in sight."
Tyrone Street.
"Yeah, but we're not even there yet."
We're still at the good part.
We're not even sick of each other yet.
What are you doing?
Hurry and get up!
I was going to cook some bean sprouts.
"I've already made the rice, serve yourself."
"All right, all right, I'll take care of it."
What the hell?
Are you trying to kill yourself?
Please hurry and cross!
Hurry!
You can't stop traffic!
Hello.
- I'm sorry for being late.
- Hello.
I'm sorry.
Are you having some problems in your life?
Excuse me?
"Oh, I don't have any problems in my life, editor."
"I haven't been getting any sleep, and I overslept."
You must've had a good sleep.
"Yes, that's correct."
"All right, let's start the meeting."
Yes.
"It fits perfectly, it doesn't need any adjustments."
I'll make that decision.
All right.
Did you gain some weight?
"No, I didn't."
You must've been slacking off on your exercise.
Did I gain weight?
Why isn't your groom here?
"He's coming, he'll be here."
Did I gain a lot of weight?
"In South Korea, there are only five people who know about this."
What's the plan?
Infiltrate Pyongyang.
And take the lives of 30 North Korean generals.
Are you planning to go on the mission?
I can't just give up.
"I will be the one going, you should quit."
You're not alone now.
Kyeong Hee.
Mu Yeol.
"Must have been tiring alone, right?"
I'm sorry.
Please hold this...
"This is our son, isn't it?"
Let me have a look at him.
"Oh, he's really handsome."
"Baby, I'm your father."
I heard that you didn't come out quickly.
Your mother worked so hard.
"Both of you, you are now new parents."
"Ms. Kyung, you've worked hard."
"Kid, she is your sister-in-law."
Thank you for returning safely.
I saw the news.
You don't know how much I was worried.
"Don't worry, I'm all right now."
Crazy guy!
Why would my wife worry about you?
I know that you're as strong as my husband.
"Ah, I'm broken-hearted!"
I need to get married this year at once.
"Well, take good care of sister-in-law."
Come on.
We got to catch those three.
They might make trouble.
"You're not going, commodore."
For $10 million?
Don't be a jackass.
Headed toward the ferry.
"Boys, you grab a horsecar, cab, anything."
Get over to the ferry!
I'll take bessie.
Giddap!
Heaven preserve us!
There you are.
"Stay there, now."
Yah!
"Hey, move!"
Clear the road!
The colonel's in there!
"Come on, boys!"
Take it away!
You scoundrels!
I'll run you down if i have to crawl in every rat hole in jersey!
"Good-bye, commodore!"
The colonel is sorry he couldn't wait to receive you.
"And you take good care of bessie, cornele."
I'll pay you for the oats when i get back.
I thought you were going to jersey city with jim.
So did i.
Is he all right?
I hope so.
Would you think me rude if i wondered why you've come here?
Jim got a fool idea somebody was going to try to annoy you- look at you sideways or something.
"Oh, my books, they're coming loose."
"Say, that ain't a bad-looking doll, that one in the middle."
- The one with the pretzel legs.
"- He means you, Laury."
"- Why, the fresh..."
"- Don't be so smart-alecky, Rocky Sullivan."
- Go on.
"Beat it, pigtails."
"- Trying to show off, ain't you?"
"- Scram, before I wipe the street with you."
- You better wipe your nose first.
- Is that so?
I'll fix you.
- You better scram.
You know the Rocky.
- Come on.
"- Leave me alone, I can handle him."
Wait till I get down there.
I'll fix you.
- I'll slap you down.
- Oh!
"Why, you, you..."
Shut up.
Come on.
"Let's get out of here, dig up some corn."
"You won't get away with that, Rocky."
I'll get even someday.
You just wait.
"Say, maybe this winter we can hop a freight to Florida."
"They say you can go swimming there, even in January."
"Sure, we can even hop one to California if we wanted to."
"Look here, ""Rubelin Coal Company, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."""
That's a Palm.
Keep it.
Got ten more on order.
Why don't you crawl on back to your crib?
"Hey, you need a beer, keg's always on tap."
Yeah.
This ain't right.
What's the verdict?
"Well, other than a few hiccups, it's looking good."
What hiccups?
"According to Julien's statement, he didn't see the shooting."
What do you mean?
He was right there!
He says he was in the woman's apartment.
But I wouldn't worry about it though.
It's gonna be a good shoot.
–Dutch.
–Jordan's alibi checked out.
I ran a records check on everyone in Kayla's building.
–Any hits?
–Two: a woman passing bad checks and a Bob Lindhoff.
Bob Lindhoff?
I just had him down here.
"Nine years ago, an attempted kidnapping charge, later dropped."
She's coming to again.
Get in the car.
Hey!
"Hey, I tried to call, but there was no answer."
We went out to grab a bite to eat.
What's up?
I've got a suspect down at the station I was hoping you could I.D.
You mind coming back?
- I'll untie him myself.
"- Yes, that's right."
"Only one hand, that's all I need at you."
Just one hand.
- Hurry up about it.
"- I'll take all day, if you order me around."
"I owe you one, anyway."
"Mate, look at your back."
- Never mind that.
Untie my hands.
- Just look what they did to you.
"I'm sorry, mate."
The fiends!
- The Guru.
- Filthy scum.
- Dog.
- Maniac.
- Let's get him.
- Here we go.
Grab him regardless how many are with him.
It's our only chance.
"He's sacred, so they won't shoot us."
"Why, you hairless dog."
"Look what you did to that man's back, you filthy..."
"A lesson in the error of false pride, Sergeant."
You're talking very proudly yourself.
Perhaps you're not too proud to give a little information I seek.
- I want to know about your army.
"- Why don't you enlist, mate?"
Lash.
"For a beginning, this is not bad."
Three soldiers to be given to Mother Kali... three soldiers and a slave.
So... are we good?
So-
(SIGHS) He basically knows.
He doesn't know jack shit.
FINN:
"Well, he knows that you have some kind of information."
How long is he going to be content just piggybacking your bets?
I don't know.
Forever?
I got it under control.
"You look like hell, Jasper."
Are you even sleeping?
"You know what, man?"
Get off my dick!
You and Callie both get all this money for doing nothing.
- You should be happy.
- We're all in this.
Callie and I are sharing the risk.
I hope you have a back-up plan in case this thing with your bookie falls through.
I seem to remember you wearing something a little different in tonight's photo.
"Screw you, Jasper."
I'm not going to start as long as he's here.
"Yeah, no, Jasper was just about to take a walk."
Aren't you?
I am?
Yeah.
"Yes, don't forget to come spy on me at 8:00."
(DOOR CLOSES) (SIGHS)
So I don't really know what I'm doing here.
You're going to have to walk me through it.
Sure.
"Um, we just need to get you in the same pose in the photo."
"Marcus Zerbib, you know him?"
He wasn't a friend.
You two were in business.
Some nasty gossips say he snitched on you 4 years ago.
The guys he snitched on would fill the phone book.
"But only you could gun him down in cold blood, during a leave from jail."
Would I waste him when I have 2 weeks left to do?
"What's wrong, Leo?"
"- Nothing, why?"
- Don't kid me.
"You're lost, I can tell."
"I'm in deep shit, and I can't discuss it."
Not even with me?
Not even with you.
- Where were you that night?
- With a cop.
HQ's finest cop.
"We met at ""Swann's"""
"at 1 AM, we chewed the fat till 5 AM, then he dropped me at my hotel."
OK?
His name?
Vrinks.
I'll need your boys.
What for?
We located the van gang.
How'd you get the tip?
Know a man called Silien?
Why?
Says he was with you when Zerbib died.
"If he says so, must be true."
Could I have that in writing?
Investigating murders now?
The aunt is jealous of me!
"You mustn't say that, dear!"
This is only a trailer.
Had I shot the whole show we'd have had a video-library!
You're lying!
Stop this nonsense!
"Let me talk to her, sir."
"Well, Kaushi?"
Why did you do that?
"You dare steal here, Kaushalya!"
Impudent woman!
"Dangerous woman, sir!"
She's playing the Bandit Queen!
"You, too?"
Shut up!
"Who else, if not I?"
!
The neighbours won't ask if my house is robbed!
"I ran out of battery, or I'd have shot the night-scene..."
The day-scene is all so obvious!
Why'd we need night-scenes?
"Call the police, Banwa."
"That's not necessary, sir!"
I'll personally throw her out!
Shameless creature!
You dare bite the hand that feeds!
"Will you do all that in my presence, Banwa!"
Yes.
The garden is the ideal place.
Let's go...
"The plate, Banwa..."
Sure.
Have you split up?
You could say that.
"Believe me, I could see it coming."
"Don't ask me how, but I did."
"There was something in your relationship, forgive me, that didn't work."
When are you leaving?
"- Very soon, but I'll see you before."
- I hope so.
I'm sorry you're going.
- I'm off.
"Benigno, see you soon."
- Yes.
Has her period come yet?
Going by last month's nursing report it should have come.
"Yes, it is a bit late."
It's over two weeks.
That's too much.
Are you sure she had one last month?
I put the towel on her myself.
It was the week you had flu.
She even seems swollen.
"Yes, but at times they can be irregular."
Lydia's periods have stopped.
You're right.
But I think we should tell Dr.Vega.
I brought some of my travel guides for Alicia and you.
Thank you.
I've said good-bye to Lydia.
I tried to see Alicia but Dr.Vega and the head nurse were there and I wasn't allowed in.
Is anything wrong?
"No, I think Alicia has got an infection."
Can you take me home?
"Here look, Fuk (winter melon)."
Fuck!
What kind of person are you?
Are you talking to me?
I'm talking about that guy.
What kind of person?
Are you talking to me?
I'm talking about that guy.
A person whose personality like that shouldn't live long.
Oh you also mean that guy?
I meant you!
"""Speak English like a native"""
Oh gosh!
Hey what is with you?
Don't get any closer.
I will poke and blind you.
It's not worth it.
You like it rough?
I'm going to take that interview so I can go get Kaya back.
You have to teach me.
Ask your daddy to teach you then.
Aren't you mixed?
Hey!
My dad is French.
He fled back to his country before I could walk.
You can study with some other teacher.
"No, I can't."
You taught Kaya so you have to teach me.
"You saw your cut-out standee, right?"
So will you teach me?
Sure
One on one?
!
Yes!
Good!
Then I'll have to go it alone.
You work here?
I wanted to tell you...
You're here in this bar?
Toni promised that he wouldn't steal you away.
You're ruining the hotel!
I should have known.
Where is Toni?
In his office.
"Franz, we had no contract."
I said that I would help you.
But you never paid me.
That's why.
Is that the only reason?
Among others.
You did steal Nora away!
You might as well hire Tom!
Then we'll all leave and you can build your luxury hotel  or your recreation center or whatever!
You've already prepared contracts?
Where are they then?
"Calm down, Franz."
Is that loaded?
You promised me that you wouldn't take Nora away from me.
And you gave Josphine money so she'd leave?
!
You're pointing a gun at me?
We're cousins right?
As far as Nora is concerned...
She applied at the bar.
Cool!
I like fat black girls.
I can't believe this cruise doesn't have cocktail sauce.
"Finish your breakfast, Rallo!"
"Hey, Junior."
Huh?
"All right, pirates, in one hour we board the cruise ship to rape, pillage and plunder."
PIRATES:
Yay!
"And maybe this time, a little less raping."
"I think with the last boat, we all got a wee bit carried away."
"We're better than that, you guys."
"I never thought I'd say this, but if I have to eat one more friggin' shrimp"
I'm gonna kill myself.
I got one!
(flapping like a fish)
"Okay, okay, stop it!"
"Oh, my goodness, a talking whale!"
I'm not a talking wha...
"Oh, come on, that's... that's mean."
"What mysteries of the deep have you come to tell me, o sea monster?"
"Junior, it's me."
Your dad.
Daddy!
"""Dad,"" 14. ""Dad."""
"Listen, we're in a heap of trouble."
Somali pirates are about to take over the ship unless we stop them.
Where's your mother?
She's dead.
"Oh, right."
Where's Donna?
(funk music playing)
My agent's.
"You and me, given opportunities only because young men are gone."
Or dying.
"But to turn our back on those opportunities, even when one has suffered such great loss, wouldn't that be giving death dominion over life?"
Have you seen it yet?
Our film?
You should.
It's very good.
I'm awfully good.
And so are you.
Calling all small boats.
All seaworthy vessels to report to your local harbor master immediately.
"Dunkirk. on, Lily!"
I think they're gonna get 'em out.
"Then they're going to need all the boats they can get, aren't they?"
The Nancy.
"- Here, boy."
- Here.
"Don't be a fool, Johnnie."
There's a sniper up there.
I don't care if he's got a bleedin' cannon.
I'm not gonna sit by and watch him shoot a dog.
Aww!
What in the-
- What is that?
"It's France, Uncle Frank."
Dunkirk.
Blimey.
There's so many of us.
They'll never get us all out.
Hitler?
Hitler?
It just came to me.
"Gee, I'm awful glad you could stay, Wilbur."
"Oh, I am, too."
Except I can only stay over the weekend.
Oh.
Would you like to sit down for a while?
Okay.
"No, sit over here."
No.
Close your eyes.
Real tight.
(GASPS) Why do you want...
"Oh, you scared me."
I was going to ask you why you wanted me to close my eyes.
"Well, Wilbur seems to know his way around a campus, doesn't he?"
I can't understand that.
"I could have sworn he was the shy, studious type."
I'll say.
"Man, dig that crazy homework."
I better have a little talk with him.
I don't think he understands girls.
Neither do I. I wish you'd have a little talk with me.
I got to get out of here.
Hey.
Kiss me!
Kiss me!
"Oh, no!"
"Get away, you!"
"Remember, girls, tomorrow we're having a test on the alloyed group."
I want a list of all our enzyme experiments.
Are there any questions?
Class dismissed.
- [Squelching]
- Euch!
This is disgusting.
You're no threat to humanity.
"Well, except for maybe the gross-out factor."
"Go ahead, slimy."
Take your best shot.
Hot dog!
A worthy adversary.
"Don't press the ""Don't"" button."
"I'll press your ""Don't"" button, buddy."
[Strains] Heavier than it looks.
Eat bricks!
"Ooh, he's good."
Can I clone or can I clone?
"Surrender, Tick, you're hopelessly outclassed."
I don't know the meaning of the word surrender.
"I mean, I know it, I'm not dumb."
Just not in this context.
And if it's class you want...
Now talk to me about class.
Lucky break.
[Pants and strains]
Here goes nothing.
Oh.
Need an extension cord.
Huh?
What?
"Oh, that old joke."
"So, what tired routine do you do for an encore?"
"Oh, dear."
- [Crashing]
"All right, I'll show you how to set it."
You got five numbers.
"Left, right, left-right, left."
Full turns in between.
You'll hear a loud click when you're done.
"So, what's it gonna be?"
What about six-two-six-two-nine?
What is that?
"It's ""Nancy"" if you spell it out on the telephone."
You think that shit is slick?
Like nobody's gonna figure that out?
"And no kids' birthdays, either."
People can just look that up.
Okay.
- Hi.
- Hi.
"- You like me, don't you?"
- Yeah.
- You want me to be your girlfriend?
- Yes?
I'm not gonna kiss you until I get my braces off.
"And that won't be for a while, like maybe even a year."
That's okay.
"Okay, then."
They're just roomier.
- Did you see it?
- At least they got her hair right.
"So, if this thing goes national, how much money are we talking?"
New dishwasher?
New house?
It's Isabelle's money.
- The law in California clearly states...
No.
But we had aorai agreement.
"I me,he promised to pay me back."
With interest.
"I mean,I maxed out all of my cards, so you better findhat money."
What was he like the last time you saw him?
He was sweet.
We made love right before he left.
Use a condom?
I'm on the pill.
We were engaged.
"Abs,can dna still be recovered from lance corporal finn's skivvies?"
It would take the cooperation of weather and protection.
"He was wrapped in plastic and it's been cold,so... there's a decent chance."
"Well,run the tests."
We'll do a cheek swab on his fianc?
s.
"Wait,did you say ""fianc?"
s?
""" Like plural?"
Kinky.
- Is that it?
"- For now,iri."
I need to follow you home and pickp his belongings.
I want them back when james returns.
He's dead.
He can't return.
"Look,I know he's not dead."
I would feel it in my heart.
We're soul mates.
no.
Agent lee.
- It's not gay.
Just take your shirt off.
- It's not gay.
"Why can't I just get, like, all excited and passionately rip it off in the moment?"
- Why can't you just take your shirt off for us?
- Just drop it for now.
"All right, all right."
"Uh, maybe you should punch something."
- There you go.
"- Yeah, you should punch something..."
Why don't you punch this board?
Okay.
Hold it steady for me.
- Watch your eyes.
"- All right, come on."
Oh!
"Oh, that's..."
- That looks like it stings.
"- Oh, my God."
- What's that made out of?
"- It's a board, so it's, you know, made out of wood."
"- It's, like, particle board."
"- It's, like, harder than wood, dude."
- No.
- It's actually softer than wood.
"- Yeah, it's a lot softer than wood."
- Petrified wood.
"- What happened, man?"
I thought you were...
- I don't know.
- I wasn't drunk enough.
- You should be drunk for this.
Get out of my house!
This is my house!
Get out!
"Austin, what are you doing?"
I can't sleep.
Can I sleep with you?
When hell freezes over.
But I'm miserable.
I also threw up.
- Where?
- In the john.
But I still feel awful.
Okay.
I'll get you some ginger ale.
It'll settle your stomach.
I don't know how I got here.
"I mean, how did I become,"
"God, such a giant fuck-up."
Hey.
You were a...
pretty good doctor and a really good diet-pill salesman.
That was all bullshit-- the opposite of when I'm with my kids.
"That's when I was really myself-- watching ""Lost In Space,"""
"playing concentration, grilled cheese."
"Well, you are..."
on their level.
That is for sure.
"I always figured having kids would force me to grow up, but... it was the total opposite."
I knew who I was with my kids.
It's the only thing I was good at.
That is not true.
"You know it's true, Betty."
Rashad!
What'd they say?
She's there.
We're getting her exact location now.
Good.
Have my men dump him into the ocean.
"Uh, okay, whoa."
Whoa.
You can't just dump him.
I'm involved now.
"His body washes up on South Beach, there's gonna be an investigation, an autopsy."
It won't take long before those drugs are traced back to me.
What do I care?
It's not my problem.
Let me at least just take the body back to the hospital.
We'll dump it in the incinerator.
Nobody will know.
"But we got to move fast, 'cause security comes on at 4:00."
You got the information you needed.
Let us take care of this.
"Mr. Hamady, you saved my life."
It's the least I could do.
Fine.
Take him.
I'm done here.
Jesse!
How long has it been?
Four minutes.
Four minutes?
We're cutting it pretty close.
Come on.
Let's get out of here before Jabbar sees us.
In what way?
"Well, you know, she and I would get going, and, uh, you know, there was never any middle ground."
It just would always end up being an all-out war.
And it never accomplished anything.
"It would just end up leading... well, you know where it led."
You lost her.
Are you afraid that you might lose Erica?
I don't know.
I--I don't understand.
"I mean, I don't even know what that was in there."
I was not a good father.
"And I'm aware of that,"
But I am a good therapist.
"Yes, but even the best therapists miss things."
What?
"Just tell me, then."
What is the connection here?
"You know, why am I having the same fight with Erica"
That I used to have with my daughter?
Only one way to find out.
Stop it!
Sarah.
Let go of me!
Sarah!
"Forget it, dad, I'm never coming home!"
"Sarah, wait."
Wait!
I just wanna talk to you.
"Yeah, well, you never listen to me."
There's no point.
"Wait, wait, wait!"
"This time, I will listen."
Just fucking hit me!
"- Get out of here, you pussy!"
"- Yes, ma'am."
Here.
"Yes, ""yes, ma'am."""
"Now, get out of here... pussy."
Here you go.
"You want to sing something, Adam?"
- [Sobs] No.
- No.
"- Oh, no, no, no, no, no."
- It's okay.
"- Adam, come on."
- I feel stupid.
"No, we're gonna ge- we'll dry you off."
"- I know, he's very dumb."
- I feel stupid!
Let's go to the bathroom.
Come on.
"I would have DDT'd that dude, but I pulled my back this morning... farting."
I farted really hard.
"I don't know about fighting anymore, you know?"
"If you hit somebody, and you kill them by accident, you're flying con air."
You couldn't have fought that dude.
You're guarding all the Molsons.
I had to guard the Molsons.
"If Jillian wouldn't have been such a fight hog, we would have scared that dude something no-nonsense."
He was intimidated.
- What was that?
- He was intimidated at first.
"Guys, come on."
We got punked.
Mm-hmm.
"Need anything else, agents?"
"Yeah, is Sheriff Hanscum around?"
Sorry.
She's out for the rest of the week.
"Hell of a time to take a vacation, right?"
"Okay, so, we have two victims, with seemingly nothing in common except, uh -- a love for eclairs."
Check this out.
What is that?
A birthmark?
Huh.
"So the weight had to come off somehow, right?"
What if it's a suction mark?
A suction mark?
Okay.
"Uh, changeling?"
"Yeah, but changelings don't take over kids."
Neither of the vics had any.
And we don't know if Wayne McNut had a suction mark.
Unless we missed it.
Yeah.
"Well, we should, uh, split up."
One of us should hit the morgue.
The other should stay here and question the staff.
I'll stay.
Ain't gonna happen.
Why?
Because you're weird around girls.
"What does that mean, weird?"
You're awkward.
"You know, weird -"
- Sam Weird.
- Yeah.
Are you ready for the hearing?
About that--do you think I could make it home before Thursday night?
Thursday night?
"Yeah, there's this meeting I usually speak at back home in Bedford, and I just don't want to be in Pittsburgh any longer than I have to be."
I don't think we can get it done that fast.
"Man, I just don't know."
I don't know what I'm doing.
What?
"I mean, you've seen her, you know?"
"She's beautiful, and she's grown up, and my life is a joke."
It's just-- l don't know. I don't-- [sighs]
"This is how I used to think about myself, I know."
"- l can do this, right?"
- Right.
"Because I'm better now, right?"
I can do this. I'm her daddy.
I can do this.
This is where l'm staying.
Nice place.
[laughs]
"Not really, but it's cheap."
"I live two hours away from here-- you know, in Bedford."
- Do you know it?
- No.
Bedford's really nice.
"It's quiet, it's peaceful."
"Do you want to come up for a while, maybe watch a movie?"
"No, no."
"I, uh-- l can buy you dinner."
There's a nice diner down the street.
Come on.
I was winning.
"They're beings, Trelane."
They have spirit.
They're superior.
"No, no."
You saw.
"You'll grow up, Trelane."
You'll understand.
Now come along.
"Aw, but you said I could."
You promised.
I never have any fun.
"Stop that nonsense at once, or you'll not be permitted to make any more planets."
"Aw, but you saw."
I was winning.
I would have won... honest.
"No, Trelane."
"No, Trelane."
I would have.
I would have.
I would have.
I would.
I would.
I would.
I would.
"Captain, we regret that the life paths of yourself and your companions have been disturbed."
Who are you?
Who is Trelane?
You must forgive our child.
The fault is ours for indulging him too much.
He will be punished.
We would not have let him intercept you had we realized your vulnerability.
- We've got to go there.
- How?
Take a bus?
- We'll go in this.
"- Tia, the tires are flat."
Come on.
"If it doesn't start cooling soon, the chain reaction will start."
You hear that?
"In ten minutes, this place is going to be a hole in the ground."
"Now, let's be reasonable."
We have three and a half million dollars in the control room.
And the balance is on the way.
It's a deal.
I do not compromise.
"- Hey, what are you guys doing?"
- Nothing!
Nothing!
We're doing nothing.
"Hey, kids!"
How did these children get past security?
"Sir, the people destroying the furnace kidnapped my brother."
"If I could see him, I might stop them."
- She can do it!
- She can do it.
- Do what?
"Impossible, they're inside the room."
They've sealed the door somehow.
- What part has to be fixed?
- The emergency cooling system.
- Where is it?
- Five levels down.
But it's too late.
You're fine?
You haven't seen Violet since she got home.
"You live with her for six months, now you won't even pick up a clean shirt?"
You won't talk about it.
Like you talk about you getting fired?
"I'm doing my job, Cooper..."
the one I have left.
My problems aren't getting in the way of that.
I have a patient.
"Echo is now a grand old matriarch, her crossed tusks make her unmistakable."
Hello.
"Violet, you're there."
Yeah.
"Well, that's how the telephone works."
You call people.
They answer.
You speak.
Right.
"Uh, look, I was just calling to remind you that if Lucas can't sleep, give him the sheep toy."
"And he likes the rain sound, but not the whale calls."
"Uh, well, nobody likes the whale calls."
They're eerie.
You're checking up on me.
Yeah.
I was hoping you'd be out.
"Well, Lucas is sleeping now, so, uh, I better go."
You know what they say...
sleep while the baby sleeps.
The Larsens?
My Larsens?
Yeah.
"Well, my Larsens now."
- Rape isn't a joke.
- No.
- It is in this line.
"It gets a big laugh, though."
"Hey, we're about to do..."
"Oh, no, we're not."
"This, you're being pulled by a, whatever that's called, a dolly rig."
- These guys are towing the...
- Not actually driving.
Is this the night...?
"Oh, no, that's gonna be in another scene."
- Is this a real or fake background?
- This is all real.
- We're really being...
- That's 1 st Avenue.
"I don't think we had a fake background in the Yugo, did we?"
No.
"Oh, except when I'm, like, driving into the city."
- In the van we had a fake thing.
- Seth Meyers.
"- And Lorene Scafaria, the writer."
- Our writer.
Screenplay writer.
- She's so hot.
- These guys were great.
"Some people don't realize that that's Seth Meyers, right, Mike?"
"Some, yeah."
"A lot of people, actually."
I've mentioned:
"""Yeah, Seth Meyers was the guy in the back."""
"They're like, ""No way, that was him?"""
"- Wait, what were they like?"
We'll be moving the patients out as quickly as we can.
There is no bomb.
It's Haskell DeBray.
This is how he works.
I will not leave her side.
Come along now.
Hey!
Second floor!
The cops want to talk to you!
What do you want?
- Where's DeBray?
- I don't know.
"He came by to say hello, and then he took off."
That's not his apartment?
Why would I be in his apartment?
Should I sing you a lullaby?
Like your little boy never heard from you?
Help!
Help!
No!
Why don't you talk to her?
Why don't you find out why she's been stalking me?
"Why were you at the hospital, Mrs. Price?"
I'm a news producer.
I go where the story is.
Is he clear to go?
"Yeah, I'll discharge him."
Good.
"In that case, Haskell DeBray, you are under arrest for the attempted murder of Mimi Halderman."
You have the right to remain silent...
I have no plans to remain silent.
But I'll only talk to one person.
And they put me out in the streets.
"Well, child, that ain't nothing to cry about."
Look here.
"Here you got an apartment, right smack on the corner with the highest ceiling in Harlem."
'Look at that electric light.'
"'Why, you even got running water.'"
"Ah-h, child, with that smile you got everything."
"'Why, you're the richest gal in Harlem.'"
What do you care about being outdoor?
What will I do when it rains?
"If you insist on being inside, go in and tell that landlord.."
"[""I'm Livin' ina Great Big Way""]"
* You got a snap in your fingers *
Got that.
* And a rhythm in your walk.
Got that too.
* As the elephant say I'm livin' in a great big way *
"It's all the way you look at it, you know."
* Got a handful of nothin'
"Why, you're a rich millionaire."
* But I watch it like a hawk.
True mama.
"*Well, I'm doin' okay *"
*I'm livin' in a great big way *
Tell that to the landlord.
* I'm the salt in the ocean
* I'm the sun way up in the sky *
"Oh, no."
*I'm a Franklin D. Roosevelt *
*I'm a million dollars *
* Long as I got a snap in my fingers *
* Rhythm in my walk.
Traitor you get your hands off of me!
I can't breathe!
The girl was mine!
She's of no use to us.
Only our mission for the Führer matters.
"I wonder sometimes monsieur, if you have that clearly in mind?"
It was not to be cherie.
"You bastard, I'll get you for this!"
"Indiana Jones, adieu!"
Nooo!
Take this.
Wave it at anything that slithers.
Oh my god this whole place is slithering!
Indy!
"Aow, Jesus!"
Where did you get this?
From him?
I was trying to escape.
No thanks to you.
How hard were you trying?
Where the hell were you

What are you doing?
Helping the fire!
How the hell are we going to get out of here?
"I'm working on it, I'm working on it!"
"Whatever you're doing, do it faster!"
Where are you going?
Through that wall.
Just get ready to run whatever happens to me.
What do you mean by that?
Indy!
"Let's go, Master!"
Let's go
Now you've offended Master Yeh!
Do you understand!
?
"This is his land, and the lease is up!"
To be able to keep doing business here I flatter him when I can
Now you've made trouble for me get out!
Get out!
Out!
Didn't you hear me?
Out!
Yes-out!
Out!
"Go, or I'll lie you up and send you to Mr.Yeh to be beaten!"
Best beat you to death to save trouble!
I told you so many times not to bother him!
It just goes in one ear and out the other!
Just pick up your wages and get out!
Yu-lu!
Here's 30 dumplings for the road
Please talk to Boss.
We can't leave!
Why not?
We stayed here for someone
That's right!
You'll just waste your time by staying
"No-where there's a will, there's a way!"
I won't ever agree!
What?
You won't let us study kung-fu?
You mean you stayed for Master Chang?
"I fall because of that girl, my heat has become candle."
One chance.
Only one chance.
Stand up.
And remember.
Forget about the girl and concentrate on the career.
I give you one more chance.
But keep in mind.
If your bullet would miss him.
Then my bullet will kiss you.
"This time i will shoot on throat, forget it!"
Shoot the rascal.
I am not even married yet.
Next week girl's parents are coming to see me.
Please let me go... i will free you first you free me.
On one condition.
Your every condition is accepted.
I will not kill him.
You will kill him.
No.
"No... don't do this... i have never even killed the bee, how can i kill a man?"
Teach him to kill bee.
You guys look very intelligent.
"Please let me go Sir,"
kill.
"Sir, what?"
Bee.
Bee?
Gently!
Its female.
Female?
Should not hurt.
"You should go to Alexanderplatz, this is no place for trading."
"Do you wanna go to another pub, Franz?"
Please?
Stay calm.
Just wait and see!
Buy this really genuine piece!
Why does the wealthy man in the west wear a bow and the yobbo doesn't?
Ladies and gentlemen!
"1 piece 20, 3 pieces 50!"
Come closer!
Guys do you want me to sing the tie song?
Maybe Mr Biederkopf will now sing something for us.
"Alright, alright."
What could we sing?
"Band, what tunes can you play?"
"How about... ""Ich hatte einen Kameraden""?"
Who do you think we are?
A new pub for Mr Biberkopf.
What's up?
"The Mister seeks a new pub, this one isn't swell enough."
- Get off the table!
- Says who?
Me!
I'll pay for the glasses.
"Well Biberkopf, there was no need to terrify my customers."
"Come on Cilly, I know what's going on here."
- Let's go this way!
"- No, we go this way."
"Come on please, let's go this way."
- No!
We'll go this way.
"Come on, let's go!"
Then I get to come too - it's in the rules.
Hit me.
"Your honour, there have now been two very similar murders and I think it's quite probable they were both committed by the same person."
We agree.
Hm?
"Oh, good."
"Yeah, it's pretty obvious the Crim did this too."
Let's charge him...
For murder!
Two time.
You have a good point.
How can he have a point?
Crim was in jail at the time of the murder?
You have a good point.
"Yeah, I have a good point."
How can Crim have done it?
"It's called shape shifting, your honour."
Something that's pretty darn easy to do.
"In fact, in the big city we do it all the time."
No they don't.
That's crazy.
"Yeah, look, I'm getting taller,"
I'm getting shorter.
"I'm getting taller, I'm getting shorter."
I'm getting shorter.
He's just standing on his toes.
I'm getting taller.
He's standing on his toes.
Ohhh...
"Counsellors, you have both made very compelling arguments."
He didn't.
So let me deliberate.
- What will I break?
- The head.
Now go to the shrine and pray.
- Shall I pray for something for you?
- Go ahead.
- Shall I pray for a wife for you?
- A wife?
All right.
Even if the wife is 60 years old she should have wealth amounting to one-fourth of 56 crore rupees!
56 crores?
is that all?
Move it now!
Come on!
You speak as if you are a King!
"Do you know, Pooja?"
First you will have to meet my brother at home.
"If my brother approve of you, it will mean everything's okay!"
What if your brother doesn't approve?
"Then you look for another boy, and I will look for another girl."
You are so scared of your brother?
I am not scared. I adore him!
You don't realize what a big person my brother is!
- 6 feet 2 inches.
- l am not talking of his height.
- His chest is 42 inches.
Right?
- You are right!
"I have flicked this jacket from him. lt's great, isn't it?"
That's why it's so loose-fitting on you.
- What did you say?
Loose-fitting?
- Yes!
So?
I don't get how a living person can be a ghost.
It's not a living human.
He died a long time ago.
He must have been human once.
But not anymore.
"So then, the ghost got inside him?"
"Well, that's how it started."
"Not everything that moves, breathes, and talks is alive."
Countless people have perished because they didn't understand that.
If it's not stopped... that demon will destroy this village.
Demon?
An evil ghost!
"Even among other demons, he's a master of evil."
"If that's true, why did it have to be... your daughter?"
What sin did that young girl ever commit?
Yes.
"If you go fishing, do you know what you'll catch?"
No.
He's just fishing.
Not even he knows what he'll catch.
"He just threw out the bait, and your daughter took it."
That's all it was.
Park Chun-bae
- This one?
- No.
Money.
"Yes, money."
21 dollars more.
- No!
- That's okay.
"Oh, come on."
"No.No, I meant every goddamn word of it."
You don't want to take back any of that?
Nope.
Nope.
Ok.
"Oh, and, uh, I slept with frenchie."
"I'm sorry, what?"
I slept with frenchie.
And I got the note to prove it.
You're carrying that around with you?
Wouldn't you?
"Jeez, it sounds like the end of the world down here."
"Jesus, he's pounding the leather off that thing."
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
"Yeah, no more spic jokes."
"No, F.D.N.Y. Boxing team."
"We get him in the ring, we get some side action going, pick up a little extra cabbage."
"I mean, with me and you coaching him, we'll clean up."
Whatever happened to no more mr.
"Nice guy, you guys don't give me any respect, buh-buh-buh?"
That's the job.
This is a chance to make money.
"And for that, I will revert back to my happy-go-lucky whore self."
"Just, uh, think he'll go for it?"
Can't hurt to ask.
"Christ, let's let him finish up first."
- You gavin?
- Yep.
- On your break?
"Sifu, Mousy's a good man."
Please let him be your student.
Mousy!
The injuries weakened his legs.
Your injuries are unique.
I'll have to give you a unique treatment.
How unique?
Your heart has been displaced.
I'll have to open your chest to heal you.
We'll open your ribcage and adjust the position of your heart.
We'll then close your ribcage and sew you up.
Then you'll be better.
He can handle it.
"Sifu Wong, is this knife suitable?"
Just about.
Hold him down!
I'm OK!
I'm OK now!
Come back.
Pay your respects to Marshal.
I'm known for being magnanimous.
"We're like brothers, and none of his ideas worked."
Forfeit for you.
"Sifu Wong, hey..."
Go and stand guard.
"- Sifu Wong, we're going."
- Glad you came.
Take your time.
We're on our way.

"White Tiger, there are 17 criminal cases against you."
New Bern is on its way.
There are 70... maybe 80 men.
Is that tank there yet?
They're trying to load it with that mortar round right now.
I think you're gonna need it.
"All right, let's get ready!"
They're coming!
Get some ammo down here!
What is it?
I'm being tracked.
Tracked?
What do you mean?
Someone is trying to trace my location through the satellite.
"Well, can they?"
"If they have time, yes."
Do you know who it is?
"My guess is, it's, uh, Valente."
"What, him?"
"From, uh..."
from Homeland Security?
"I don't know who he's working for now, but he told Sarah to get the bomb any way she could and to eliminate all witnesses."
All the witnesses.
Shut it down.
"No, I can't."
We just have to make sure we disconnect the feed before he finishes the trace.
Hey.
I don't get it.
Why are they just standing there?
I don't know.
Do we fire the first shot?
New Bern's here.
Get into position.
Daniela.
- Close.
- It's Vanessa.
But thanks for trying.
Please let me go with you.
I'm always doing what everyone else wants.
I wanna do something for me.
We'll go as friends.
It won't be romantic.
Unless we drink a little too much in Vienna one night.
How could you say no to that?
Seriously.
As long as you take off that ridiculous tie so I can maybe picture you with a backpack.
- What's wrong with my tie?
- I need a coffee.
He's always wearing a tie.
"So I'm the one who does the good deed, and that guy goes off with the girl?"
"Yeah, it's good to be that guy."

She is nothing if not punctual.
Is that your friend?
Your friend Clementine?
"Yeah, you know, as long as people are coming over, maybe she could come over too."
To the apartment with Grace and Jack?
"Wouldn't she be, like, the third wheel?"
Wouldn't she be a fifth wheel?
"Fine, I don't care."
Might as well get that out of the way.
What out of the way?
Making friends with your friends so that hopefully she'll leave you alone.
She's an old friend from a long time ago.
"I never slept with her and I'd never sleep with her and if I tried to sleep with anyone other than you, she'd probably kick my ass."
What does that mean?
That means I said the wrong thing.
I just want her to meet you.
And John.
Fine.
Bring her over.
"Sorry, sorry, sorry."
I wasn't thinking.
Were you on the phone with your wife?
"Yeah, that was Amy."
She wants you to come over tonight.
She wants to meet you.
Why?
You're my friend.
She thought maybe you could be her friend.
Really?
"Okay, I thought maybe you could be her friend."
My friend and her friend.
I don't know.
Why not?
Because my eyes are filled with someone else.
What are you smirking at?
Huh?
You are in serious trouble.
You're going to need fucking flippers... to wade through the shit you're in.
The lady was so upset...
I had to sack out on her couch.
Hysterical crying and shit.
"You know, I'll have to write this up."
You know that?
"Oh, yeah."
"Oh, yeah."
There was one time... me and my friend Dennis...
we were 8 or 9... we were in the front row of the grand stand... and I had a Coke in my hand.
And when I looked down...
"I mean, it was a direct hit."
And I said right there and then...
"I said, ""I'm going to live in one of these buildings... with a view like this."""
What?
You want to go inside?
Shh.
"Wait, wait, wait."
Open your eyes.
I want you to look at me.
My face is so fat...
I don't think Ray wants to sleep with me anymore.
I'm growing a mustache.
"No, it's the medication."
They're not here.
Ray took them to the movies.
"Look, come over."
I haven't felt this good in years.
Whoever calls maysound like her... but it's not gonna be her.
I don't know what happens to us after we die... but I'll bet you wherever Mary is now... she's nowhere near Indrid Cold.
What if it is her?
"She's dead, John."
The only important question now is how do you want to remember her?
I miss her so much.
I know you do.
Of course you do.
"But, John, listen... you can miss her here just as easily as there."
"Even more easily because there, you're all alone."
And that's just no way to be.
You do whatever you need to do... and I'll understand.
"But here, we have dinner at 6:00... and we open presents at 8:00."
And we hope we see you.
Okay?
"Bye,John."
WJMP time is 5:51 on this chilly Christmas Eve.
Come on.
- You know what's going on down there?
- Some problem with the traffic lights.
$%#@
Great tragedy on the River Ohio.
My God.
Get off the bridge!
Everyone's gotta get off the bridge!
Get off!
Everyone get out of your cars and get off!
C.J.
come on!
You've gotta get off.
Turn the $% thing down.
- What?
False things.
You lied to her.
"I didn't lie to her, I just..."
What difference does it makes.
I can imagine what she did with it.
But it's just that you lied too.
When you said you didn't know about Jordan coming over that night.
I thought about it for like fifty hours.
"You knew it, didn't you?"
You used me.
- It's not the same.
- Maybe it is because...
you just did what you wanted.
And didn't care about what damage it did to anybody else.
What damage did it do you?
Angela?
Angela.
Can I talk to you for a second?
- How are you doing?
- You know.
Life goes on.
I was thinking about what I said to you yesterday?
"You know, the thing."
Right.
The thing.
"Yeah, look, I'm sorry about that."
"Afterwards, I thought it through and..."
- l can see how you got upset about it.
"- No, I wasn't upset."
"Some girls wouldn't be, but you're not like that, so..."
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
"No, it's really okay."

I thought you were gonna steer clear and let me do my job.
"Well, maybe I'm not satisfied with the job you're doing, Gibbs."
"It's not about me, and you know that."
I'm not just gonna stand by and let you grill him about something that happened 16 years ago.
"He lied to me, Leon."
"What's more important is, you let him."
That's not true.
His records were sealed.
It still matters.
"I told you, it was complicated."
More than complicated.
Why the kid gloves?
Stand down.
Michael was eight when Jackie and I met.
Both parents passed away.
Kid was struggling.
I filled a void.
I tried to steer him right.
"Leon, it's tough taking things like that on."
"Yeah, and it wasn't always easy."
"But I got him into private school,"
I got him into counseling.
"He was lost for a long time, Gibbs, and now he's finally finding his way."
The last thing he needs is people giving up on him.
- People like you.
- Yeah.
I've come a long way with him.
I'm not about to give up on him now.
Gibbs.
"Yeah, Abby, I'm on my way."
"Talk to me, Abbs."
Hi-- wow.
One must be careful.
I check everyone who get into my car.
But with you there's no doubt.
Married?
-Yes.
Is your wife waiting there?
No.
Well...
We're going to my friend's place.
That's good.
It has a great ambience.
It's separated.
In the middle of the field.
I congratulate you.
You're a lucky man.
And why isn't your wife coming?
"Actually, we've been living separated for a long time."
Now that's a coincidence.
Give me five!
I'm separated too.
Watch out!
Don't be afraid.
I know these roads by heart.
How long has it been from your separation?
I'm free since 3 years ago.
Excuse me for talking like this but to me it was like freedom.
My wife thought I'd discuss who keeps the children.
I told her she could keep them forever.
I've never seen any of them since then.
Good God!
"What an ease, what a beautiful life!"
There was a moment... in which I thought of killing her.
jingle bells!
jingle all the way!
"oh, what fun it is to ride on a one-horse open sleigh!"
yeah!
yeah!
yeah!
"can i hear a ""jingle bells""?"
!
"- * dashing through the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh *"
"- * o'er the fields we go, laughing all the way *"
- [laughs]
"- * jingle bells, jingle bells [humming with mouth full]"

- Brandon Mayhew.
- Brandon Mayhew.
All right.
Brandon Mayhew.
Here we go.
Public masturbation.
- What?
- I don't get it.
What's the kick?
"Why don't you do it at home, like the rest of us with a big flat-screen TV, 50 channels of pay-per-view?"
In a Starbucks.
That's nice.
"That ain't me, man!"
I was the guy who was selling meth.
Allegedly.
Ok.
All right.
I got you.
Meth.
Right.
"Sorry, that was a little transpositional error."
Nothing a little Wite-Out can't take care of.
And a felony quantity.
- Just barely.
"- Yeah, just barely."
"The cops around here are like butchers, always got their thumbs on the scales."
But good luck arguing that in court.
Let me get down to brass tacks.
I'm going to get you a second phone call.
"You're gonna call your mommy or your daddy or your parish priest or your Boy Scout leader, and they're going to deliver me a check for $4,650."
I'll write that down on the back of my business card.
4-6-5-0.
- Major?
"- Yes, sir."
Is that General Kemper there bearing toward us?
"I believe it to be, sir."
General Kemper.
I do hope you are not seriously injured.
"They tell me that it's mortal, General."
I do pray God that it is not the case.
Is there anything I can do?
There's nothing more you can do for me.
"But, General Lee, will you see to it that full justice is done for my men who made this charge today?"
"I will do so, sir."
"Thank you, General."
"Thank you, General."
It's my fault.
It's my fault.
I thought we were invincible.
Friends.
It is all my fault.
Hear me.
"Hear me, I pray you."
It is entirely my fault.
Hear me.
Hear me.
"Please, friends."
We must rest now.
We must retire and fight again another day.
And there will be another day.
"Meanwhile, friends, we must show good order."
Never let them see you run.
Do you hear me?
Never let them see you run.
Why so wound up?
Are you a first timer?
"2,000 rupees for each of you!"
"That's the rate, take it or leave it!"
The little fucker wants to play posh!
Drag him in boys!
Get in you faggot spreading filth on the streets!
Give the money first.
The motherfucker thinks he is prime piece of ass!
Let go of me!
Don't worry about the three of us you won't get past even one!
Open the door!
Let me out!
Stop the car!
Let me go!
What happened?
Come here...
Mukesh!
What happened?
Show!
"Look, I don't know what's going on with you but whatever it is, get out of it."
Forget the past... start afresh.
"Johnny, I won't give up what is rightfully mine."
Have you lost your mind!
What do you want?
I am not here for you...
My work has been stopped.
Your work?
I told your friend about it...
go ask him.
Who stopped it?
- What do you think?
That's a ghost.
All the things happening around here are his doing.
"If nothing is done, it's not just your daughter, but everything that walks on two feet will perish."
Sir!
This is Park Chun-bae.
He owns this house.
"He killed his wife, too?"
It appears so.
What's that bastard's name?
Park Shun-baa.
Then what?
"What do you mean, what?"
Gotta get rid of it.
"Either banish it, or kill it."
I'm casting a deadly hex tomorrow at the hour of the dog.
"Yes, sir."
You got the money?
How much?
"About 1O grand, don't you think?"
LWlhaveitready.
Good.
Listen.
What I'm doing tomorrow- it's no ordinary ritual.
I'll be casting a death hex.
It's incredibly dangerous.
So you can't do anything that would taint it.
No intercourse.
Watch what you eat and drink.
Or the spell will backfire.
"Yes, sir."
Okay then.
You can go.
- But it still works.
- I don't think so.
- And if I sweep the cakes off the table?
Would that help?
"Tilde, we belong to each other."
- Go away.
- Stop it!
- Are you listening to me?
- Go away!
"Tilde, it..."
Let's go home now.
May I look?
- We're not going to make love.
"- No, I just want to look."
"- You may touch them, if you like."
"- No, I just want to look."
- We've never dated anybody else.
- No.
"Remember, when we sat in the old truck   peeling each other's clothes off?"
How old were we?
- Twelve... thirteen.
"- Eleven, I think."
That's pretty advanced for two 11-year-olds.
It's as if the world got bigger with you.
Everything was more fun.
More entertaining.
"If you don't stop shooting up, you'll die."
"No, I won't die."
The drugs are keeping me alive.
"You need to take a break, or you'll die."
You're my break.
It's you.
The first days are different from now.
Serving tea to your husband is work now?
is it the same?
"Yes, but it's not work."
"Whether you make tea or serve it, it's work."
"I serve you tea, it does you good."
But no one takes care of me to help me relax.
I know you're exhausted.
Serving tea is work these days.
Don't take any photos.
I have three jobs.
"I have three jobs, not you."
And the third is the hardest and most important.
Don't take any photos!
- l should have kept it.
- l'll put it away.
- l said no photos.
- All right.
I won't do it again.
Don't men have a third job?
Only women?
We don't?
"If men don't do their third job, they'll be dishonoured."
Their third job weighs as heavily as a mountain.
It's a very hard job to do.
It's not as simple as you think.
is that wrong?
- Mashti Hatam!
- What?
"Come on, come on."
The engineer's forgotten his camera again.
He's as distracted as me.
I need one of the pieces your father collected.
I learned to hate you in the last ten years.
I never meant to hurt you.
I was a child.
I was in love.
It was wrong and you knew it!
You knew what you were doing.
Now I do!
This is my place.
Get out!
I did what I did.
"You don't have to be happy about it, but maybe we could help each other out now."
I need one of the pieces your father collected.
"Bronze piece, about this size, with a hole in it, off-center, with a crystal."
You know the one I mean?
Yeah.
I know it.
Where's Abner?
Where's Abner?
Abner's dead.
"Marion, I'm sorry."
"Do you know what you did to me, to my life?"
I can only say I'm sorry so many times.
"Well, say it again, anyway."
Sorry.
"Yeah, everybody's sorry."
Abner was sorry for dragging me all over this earth looking for his little bits of junk.
I'm sorry to still be stuck in this dive.
Everybody's sorry for something.
"It's a worthless bronze medallion, Marion."
You going to give it to me?
Maybe.
How you doin'?
"Okay, why don't you just... put down the gun and tell me what's going on here."
Yeah.
He's come around three nights in a row.
This son of a bitch is stalking us.
- I'm John Klein.
My car broke down...
"- Let's let Gordon finish, Mr. Klein."
Two nights ago... at 2:30 in the a.m.
there's a bang on the door.
"I open it up, and here's this guy."
He says he wants to use the phone.
But there's something creepy about him... so I tell him to get lost.
"Last night at 2:30 on the dot, guess who's back."
You're sure it was Mr. Klein here?
I am absolutely positive.
it's Mr. Klein.
- Crazy.
This is...
- I am not crazy.
- I didn't say that you...
- So then what happened?
I warned him off my property.
"I used the word ""trespass"", and he still came back."
"You're lucky I'm a Christian, because I had the right to shoot you on my porch."
"He'd have to been inside the house, Gordon."
What?
Fine.
"So tonight I figured the dumb %$# might come back, and sure enough, there he is."
It´s Imposible.
It wasn't me.
I don't know what's happening here.
And the pig's tongue is for you only.
I wanted to fool you!
"I want to take your advantage, so what?"
I won't give it a damn to tell you the truth.
"It's hot, and life is boring,"
"I just want to have fun, isn't it alright?"
That's alright!
"Well, it's OK then."
Why do you stare at me?
"Because of our friendship,"
I'll let you kiss something anyways.
You'd better ask her.
Excuse me.
"Chan Mon-gut, you are a married man, why do you still date me for dinner?"
You'll make me misunderstand something.
Haven't you thought of my feeling?
A smart guy isn't a big shot.
Miss Shiu.
Very simple!
She secretly admires him.
He fooled him.
He wants to kiss her.
You are mad at him.
"I wanna beat you, you know?"
Siu-tso!
Lend it to me.
Miss Shui...
Please wait!
"Miss Shui, it's dark outside, let me show you the way home."
"No, you'd better lend me the lantern."
I'll return it next time.
Next time?
It's over!
- So what are we supposed to do?
- Let him in.
Thank you.
"No, wait."
Let me talk to her again.
Jenna.
Open up.
Michael's not here.
He's outside with your dad.
Jenna.
Have you got something to say for yourself?
"I don't know, I'm..."
I panicked.
I got scared.
"Well, that's a very compelling argument."
You won't have any trouble convincing her of that.
What the fuck were you thinking?
Did you just get bored?
"- No, I'm just an idiot."
"- On that much, we're agreed."
"I love her, Stephen."
I realize now I love her more than I will ever love anybody else.
Stop talking about love.
Every asshole in the world says he loves somebody.
- It means nothing.
- But it's true.
It still doesn't mean anything.
What you feel only matters to you.
"It's what you do to the people you say you love, that's what matters."
It's the only thing that counts.
"And you did do this thing, right?"
- Me!
You're about to see a trick by Foguinho the Magnificent.
Wait right there.
This is a very special box.
It came from a very serious land.
- Do you see anything inside?
- No.
"It is a magic box, you see?"
When I go like this-
A rose for the pretty girl!
"Can we get some applause, kindly?"
You'll share this room with Quico for now.
"This is all yours, my darling."
Do you like the room?
It's really high.
"Put your things away, darling."
What is the matter?
There's a whole closet just for you!
We're used to it Mrs. Maria Cecília.
"At the circus, we don't get a lot of room."
"It doesn't matter, my love."
We'll get you settled in later.
There's no rush.
Enjoy the party.
"There are so many kids here, and so many sweet treats."
Go on over to the living room.
"Go play with Foguinho and the kids, sweetie."
Barbuda will be right there.
She's so quiet.
She's been lately always thinking...
- Thinking about what?
- Like I'd know!
- Thank you.
Sorry.
She has this book club.
It's a couple of ladies from the school.
- My school?
- Yeah.
"They sit and pretend they read, but mostly it's just gossip."
"Hey, if you help me, we can get out of here really quick."
- Help you?
- We just need set out some sandwiches.
"Oh, uh..."
"Boy, I just..."
I don't know how much of a help I would be.
"You know, I..."
I once worked for two weeks at McDonald's and I accidentally gave away the secret to the secret sauce.
"It's ketchup and mayonnaise, by the way."
"Christine, are you embarrassed by what I do?"
No.
I'm not embarrassed at all.
"But I mean, why didn't you tell me you were Marly's housekeeper?"
"I'm sorry, should I have said:"
"""Before you get too attached to me, you should know I'm a housekeeper""?"
"Well, you came right out with the Portuguese thing."
"I'm kidding, I'm kidding."
"No, I..."
I don't care what you do.
I am not like one of them.
"Great, then help me so we can get out of here."
Okay.
I'll...
I'll help you.
I'm excited.
But we're still gonna have to have DMV retest her.
For me.
"Hello, Henry."
That's a boy.
That's a boy.
"See, Daddy?"
Daddy?
Henry.
"You know, I wonder if some kids might have picked up that baby food."
"Maybe, but the way those boxes were bouncing out of that truck they could have gone anywhere."
"Oh, no."
There's that couple.
Remember that couple yesterday with the flat tire?
Of course.
Scavengers.
That's it!
They must have hung around.
I think we're getting senile.
Not me.
"Oh, what happened?"
What did you do now?
- We know where the baby food is.
- Where?
- A gypsy van.
- A school bus.
"- Hey, slow down now."
- Scavengers.
"Slow down, slow down."
Hold it.
"Now, tell me about it."
"After we cited the baby-food truck about half a mile further, we saw a school bus..."
"Converted school bus, gypsy van, loaded like you can't believe."
He picked up your brother because... you were crying.
He saw my distress and offered me money.
He said it was a good family.
"Oh, God!"
What have I done?
You survived.
Made a home for me.
You did what you had to do.
I don't blame you.
You should've told me.
I know.
"Can you remember his name, the lawyer?"
Why?
"Somebody killed him, Mother."
He was trying to come home.
They killed him.
"Alain, please."
Can you remember his name?
Etienne St. Denis.
He had an office in Place Pigalie in Paris.
Parents always lie to their children... to prepare them for the way they'll be treated later by the government.
Maybe I'm wasting my time.
"But if I don't go now, I'll regret it for the rest of my life."
What do you gain?
You only open old wounds.
The lawyer can't bring him back.
My brother was adopted.
"If I can find his family, I can learn about him."
Kind of get to know him.
The lawyer's office is on the sixth floor.
"Remember, I'll do the talking."
Okay?
- What?
- I...
- Hurry up and say it!
This office...
The person who is renting and using this office...
I was... doing something here...
- On the side.
- What did you do on the side?
Something similar to a detective agency...
What the heck were you going around doing?
You don't have to worry too much.
I... saw the faces of our suspects.
What are you talking about?
I saw two guys running out of here.
"I know who they are, so we can go and catch them together."
"Wait, wait, wait, wait."
Wait one second.
"So... these guys that you know, were in your office..."
"And they murdered a guy, that you know... and ran away."
"But on their way out, they happened to run into you?"
"Sir, this is the place."
Get ready.
Open the door!
It's the police!
- Open the door!
- Who is it?
- It's the police.
Open the door!
- What's going on?
My arm!
My arm!
Hold on a second!
So many dogs!
- I'll need your assistance.
You'll have to pull out the pipe and stitch up the wound.
- All right.
This is gonna hurt.
But I'm gonna get you through it.
"Oh, God, I'm gonna throw up into your cut."
"Ahhh, I saw inside of you."
How are humans alive?
"- Okay, uh, I'll do the surgery, and, uh, you just breathe, okay?"
We'll get you through this.
- Okay.
"- Ugh, what was that sound?"
I did not like that squish sound.
- The pipe has been removed.
Now...
I'm sewing myself up.
"Okay, this is almost over."
You're doing great.
Just keep talking.
Keep talking.
- Talking about what?
"- Uh, tell me about Amy, hmm?"
You must be excited to see her.
"- Very much, you know."
"Oh, God, what if it doesn't go well?"
"We haven't seen each other in a while, and what if it's weird?"
Uhhh!
"- Keep going, keep going."
You're doing so well.
Why would it be weird?
- I don't know.
You take a look at him while he's sleeping.
"You know how cute he is, with his tush all squished up in the air like that..."
Did you see him?
See who?
That-a-way!
We're in lockdown!
This door stays closed till you hear the all-clear call.
The perimeter's sealed.
He's not getting out this way.
My jewelry box!
"Jamie, Mommy told you..."
"All right, Jamie, you've had your fun."
Now it's time to give that back to Mommy and go to sleep.
Jamie...
I asked you to give it to me!
Would you look at this thing?
It's amazing.
We've got to come up with something really great to do with it.
What if we tied mattresses to ourselves and jumped off it?
Nah.
We could do that off the roof.
We could launch mannequins into the Prestons' Jacuzzi.
Uh-uh.
It's not good enough.
We could get a squirrel to dive off it into a cup of water.
Not good enough.
Not for her.
Not this old beauty.
"Well, how about if we got a vat of Jell-O..."
No!
It's not good enough!
I got it!
You have no principles.
You're just like us.
"And you're selfish, too."
"You've gone nuts, haven't you?"
Just eat your fish.
"Moonsook, you have a lovely face."
Thank you.
My face is rather big.
Wish I could cut some off.
"No, you have a lovely face."
"You're drunk already, aren't you?"
"Yeah, a little bit."
"Moonsook, what makes you sad?"
"My father, maybe."
We don't see each other anymore.
Her father is a famous composer.
He's written many well-known songs.
"Now, I hate him the most."
But I'm also very sorry about it.
He's given me so much love.
"Every weekend, he'd take only me on his travels."
"He was like an octopus, wrapping me from behind in that closed grip, squeezing me and not letting go."
He worries about me more than I do myself.
But does that make sense?
It makes my skin crawl.
That's why she studied abroad.
To run away from him.
"Hey, you crying?"
Need this?
No thanks.
My tears are clean.
I have a question.
Stern looks so judicial.
How could he be so corrupt?
The sweater unravels.
I'll give you one this time.
"""The only thing new in this world is the history you don't know."""
New Testament?
Harry Truman.
Judge Stern's a good man.
He's good?
5 people are dead!
- What's your point?
- You throw the book at the guy.
Embrace Detective Santos.
Max death settlement for her.
Medal of Honor for the deceased.
I'll make sure Leslie makes the morning editions with it.
So you got this all figured out?
"- That's my job, isn't it?"
- That's cold.
That's cold.
I mean you don't just...
It's more complicated than that.
Forgive me.
I know the two of you are old friends.
Be careful how you judge people.
Most of all friends.
You don't sum up a man's life in one moment.
"There are no cold answers, are there?"
There's no simple yes or no.
"A man's life is not the bricks, it's the mortar."
It's the stuff that lays between.
The stuff...
Right?
"You heard it too, right?"
You think I'm deaf?
But why did you say you didn't hear?
What point is there in me fanning the flames?
You could see the team manager's eyelashes trembling.
"It's possible she could've mistaken herself for a moment, but why did she have to get angry?"
That's the first time I've seen the team manager act like that.
I was so shocked.
"Yeah, it was a bit unexpected."
Oh yeah.
I got an email asking me to call.
Let me have the phone.
"All right, I'll send it to you by phone."
It's not coming out well.
You're so sensitive.
"That's right, I'm sensitive."
Who is it?
The person who unexpectedly got angry.
Oh no...
You heard?
You think I'm deaf?
We weren't talking behind your back.
"Yes, you were."
"Yeah, Oppa?"
Are you okay?
Of course.
Did you eat lunch?
I just ate some noodles and am getting back to work.
"You're really okay, right?"
Has he called you?
He hasn't called since the day before yesterday.
Please don't cue the music until I'm waving good-bye.
- Sorry.
- It's not rocket science.
- There you are.
Did you get my email?
- About?
My new idea.
About all the fan letters I've been getting.
I thought
- I could read a few of them on the air.
- I don't really think we have time.
Sure we have time.
I'll just pick the Lotto numbers faster.
"You see, Natalie, the show's about the numbers."
That's why people are watching.
It's not really about you really.
Really?
Is that what you're hearing?
Because that's not what I'm hearing.
Why don't we discuss this later?
I'll see you monday.
Jeez!
Excuse me.
Do these cables have to be right here?
"Yes, they do."
Because they Carry your voice from this microphone to that soundboard.
Can't you put them someplace else?
I almost broke my neck.
Almost doesn't count.
"Fine, I'll do it."
"Okay, what are you doing?"
Are you mental?
Jesus Christ!
"Hold on, darling."
"911, there's been an accident."
Yes.
You okay?
"You didn't see it, did you?"
Seewhat?
What did you see?
I didn't see anything.
John.
There's something wrong with me.
It's called a glioblastoma.
It's a temporal lobe tumor.
"According to the doctor, it's extremely rare."
"600,000 gets this thing."
Did they say it was a result ofthe accident?
"No, it turns out... that it's been there a while."
There's nothing else they can do?
"No, no."
"They did the surgery, and they couldn't get it all out, so they'll... keep her on the chemo... as long as her strength holds out."
That's working.
I think she's looking better now.
Good.
That's good.
Two weeks ago... we were house hunting.
One day you're just driving along in your car and the universe... just points at you and says...
"""Ah, there you are, a happy couple."
I've been looking for you.
"I've been looking for you""."
I'm sorry.
For what?
For all of this.
And Becca...
I think you've met Becca before.
"Yes, I've met Becca before."
It's good to see you.
Hi nice to meet you.
You too.
Wow...
How are you?
I'm sorry I was actually just about to take off.
"Aw well that's too bad, well listen my tour got pushed back a month or so... so I'm going to be around."
"Oh, and hey listen tomorrow night my band and I are doing a little set at the Hotel Cafe if you guys... want to come by that would be great."
"Yeah, sure."
I love your music.
Thank you.
"Ok maybe, maybe we will."
"Well, just email me the address and..."
Yeah.
Oh...
"Ah, I think the Pap's have found you and um... your girlfriend's kind of looking a little lonely."
No pictures.
"Oh, that's actually not my girlfriend it's just a girl who's my friend."
"Oh right, um hum."
"Hey, Cece this is my friend Dale."
Hi.
"- Hey, nice to meet you."
I'm just going to get my stuff.
"Ok, we will..."
Don't forget to email me.
Don't forget to come.
So you guys all went to Catholic boarding school together?
OK I can't imagine that.
We've known each other since we were fifteen.
"How was, um..."
"""I... am... fine."""
Okay.
I guess that clears that up.
"Back to work, people."
As you were.
"Yeah, we'll talk..."
Nice post-it.
"Yeah, well, the last thing I need are people feeling sorry for me."
Is there any thing else?
'Cause I have a few weeks of work to catch up on.
Nothing.
"Well, just... the Campbell interview's this afternoon."
"- You ready or, uh-- - yeah, I can handle it, Jimmy."
Who's this?
Does it really matter?
And... these?
"It's your future, dude."
"You know, I didn't want you coming back to an office full of..."
Marjorie.
Nice.
- You want to talk about it?
"- No, I'm good."
- 'Cause I'm here if you want to.
- I know you are.
"Thanks, Jimmy."
Thank you.
"Okay, uh..."
"This is officially now, uh, an M.F.Z.--"
A Marjorie Free Zone.
"So we're rolling out the teaser campaign 2 weeks before the 21st, which is the hard date the game actually hits the stores, and the web site goes live with online, tv and trade pub print being our tent poles."
We also are doing game rental inserts.
Stop!
Francis!
Bash!
Stop!
Stop!
"Please, stop!"
You don't have to marry him!
It's all over!
"My mother, nostradamus,"
They say we can be wed.
What do you mean?
There is no prophecy keeping us apart.
"Please, listen..."
Does it matter?
"Mary, nothing needs to change."
We can still be wed.
"What do you mean, no prophecy?"
Even nostradamus will tell you.
Your fate is your own when it comes to who will you marry.
Him or me.
I knew he would get to you in time.
"Did your seer tell you that, too?"
Is this a game to you?
Nostradamus told me the prophecy was fulfilled.
With clarissa's death.
How can I believe you when you have so much to lose?
"oh, god, what are you doing?"
"Do nothing, and I will die."
"Watch me, if that's what it takes"
To convince you I'm not putting
My life ahead of my son's.
I never have.
You're not going in.
So what?
"What, we're just gonna stand out here all night?"
"Yeah, I guess so."
I don't even wanna go this is war.
This is war.
Programs!
Programs!
So let me get this straight.
You fell in love with his fiancée?
Before he proposed.
"Seriously, it's fine."
That makes no difference.
My guy should be the one going to the game.
Exactly.
My guy got invited first.
Your guy kissed my guy's girl.
I'm not gonna explain this again.
"Well, don't worry about it."
You don't have to.
I'm outta here.
Fine.
"So am I. You don't want to be friends, consider it done."
You know what you could use right now?
Ice cold ice cream.
Had to find some higher ground
Had some fear to get around
"Adam, it's Marjorie."
"I know that you probably hate me right now, but could you please call me?"
Please?
Last time through I hid my tracks
"So well, I could not get back."
What is it that you want to ask?
"You see, I think Changwook and I both want you."
"If you happen to like both of us, who would you choose?"
"You see, this situation is making us awkward."
I think it would help if things are set clear.
So who's your pick?
"I like you better, Joongrae."
I understand.
Thanks.
You should get back.
How long did you stay in Germany?
Quite a long time.
You must be fluent in German.
Just enough to get by.
She's good.
Very good.
- Were there Koreans there?
- Not really.
"It was a small tourist city, so I saw some Korean travelers."
- What are people like there?
- A bit boring.
But they are honest.
Very much so.
They express their feelings as they are.
They seem more laid back than people here.
Have you dated foreigners?
"- Men, I mean."
"- Ah, men."
Do you really want to know?
"- Well, I think..."
"- No, don't say it."
I don't care what you did there.
I don't know.
Tahiti maybe.
He's got a timeshare there.
"When a defendant has no lawyer, the court will assign one to him."
Hey!
Anyone want to be his lawyer?
"Shoot, I'll do it, Sheriff!"
All rise!
The Honorable Doc Hudson presiding.
Show-off.
May Doc have mercy on your soul.
"All right,"
"I wanna know who's responsible for wrecking' my town, Sheriff."
I want his hood on a platter!
I'm gonna put him in jail till he rots!
"No, check that."
"I'm gonna put him in jail till the jail rots on top of him, and then I'm gonna move him to a new jail and let that jail rot."
I'm...
"Throw him out of here, Sheriff."
I want him out of my courtroom.
I want him out of our town!
- Case dismissed.
- Yes!
"Boy, I'm purty good at this lawyering' stuff."
"Sorry I'm late, Your Honor!"
Holy Porsche!
She's gotta be from my attorney's office.
"Hey, thanks for comin', but we're all set."
- He's letting me go.
- He's letting you go?
"Yeah, your job's pretty easy today."
All you have to do now is stand there and let me look at you.
How many of you want something to drink?
5?
10?
20?
How big's the party?
You got no right to make fun of me.
"I got a disorder, diagnosed by a legitimate doctor."
I got inside several different people.
"- Me, Mary Maude..."
- I met her.
JM...
"There are others, I don't know."
Let's get the department shrink to ride shotgun for Frank.
Are you kidding?
"Look at the way he's smiling, he's having a ball."
Tell JMJ I wanna talk to her.
"If you want to talk to JMJ, you have got to call her."
- What the hell is he doing?
- Watch and wait.
"Well, tell JMJ that I'd like to see her."
I don't talk to her.
"Whatever he's doing, it's inappropriate."
Can't you see he's playing her game?
- I only know she's in here.
- She's faking.
They don't know about me.
I am the dominant.
He'll trip her up.
- The dominant?
- That's what they call it.
"I know about the others, but they don't know about each other."
"You know JMJ, but you can't talk to her?"
I can see what's going on here.
You make my dad angry just like my granddad made him angry.
Why?
The situation with your dad and me is complicated.
What are you looking for in his old case files?
Just something that'll make him less angry.
"You know, I'm glad you're here."
"My dad's done so much by himself, you know?"
He really needs you.
"I'm glad he has a brother, and I'm..."
Glad I have an uncle.
Can you just... can you just promise me that you're... you're here to help him?
Gracie.
Of course.
"Yeah, I promise, okay?"
"Why don't you, uh, go make me one of those double-bacon BLT sandwiches, huh?"
Your grandfather told me all about them.
You got it.
Duval:
The name's Kevin Whitfield.
It's a junkie.
Overdose.
"Yeah, but this kid has no history of drug use."
He was going to college in the fall.
"Dad, just go through it with me."
See if I missed something.
These parents came to me.
"They said their son was better than this, and I believed them, Dad."
- I did.
- Tell me.
Please tell me you have something more than that.
His backpack.
(both chuckle)
Good luck.
Isler needs you.
He's not gonna let you go that easily.
"Yeah, well, if he doesn't, I'm screwed."
(sighs)
Well good luck.
(sighs)
What-what are the police doing here?
"Oh, it's no big deal-- they're just here in case"
Darrell shows up before you leave.
But how does he know that we're leaving?
"Oh, a little birdie might've told him."
What?
"Look, Melody... you don't have to worry about him anymore, I promise."
"Why, what are you gonna do?"
What needs to be done.
(engine roaring)
"All right, you stay here."
You put Tucker in the car.
"I'll be right back, all right?"
"What's going on, huh?"
"They're arresting you, Darrell."
"Hey, what're you doing?"
Get off me.
LASALLE:
I did a background search.
You got outstanding warrants in Texas.
"That, plus assaulting a federal officer, you'll be going away for a long time."
"(grunting) Settle down, hands behind your back!"
"This ain't right, okay?"
You can't do this to me.
Would you bid a half?
75.
Got a dollar.
How about going on for a half?
$1.50.
Would you bid $2?
Did I hear $2?
I got $2 right over here.
"Thank you, sir."
Sold to Western Trail Packing Company for $2.
Could I see that bill of sale?
"Thank you, son."
You consider this an actual bill of sale?
"I'm just the auctioneer, sir."
The bill of sale's been sworn to.
"Well, whoever swore to it... was a liar and a cow thief."
Those cows belong to John Coble of the Wood River Cattle Company.
Who the hell are you?
Stock detective.
What's a stock detective?
Me.
"You may call yourself some kind of stock detective... but I'm a deputy sheriff, and I'm the law here."
Lock these men up.
I'll file the charges.
"Nobody's going to jail, unless you start some trouble."
I see.
"I'll tell you what, Horn."
I'm gonna kill you.
You ain't gonna kill nobody.
"If he don't, I will."
- Your damn charges ain't gonna stick.
- lf the charges don't stick...
No.
It's all one fuzzy blur.
That's great.
That's perfect.
Okay.
I must have passed out after I reenlisted.
- What?
- I said I passed out.
- Why do you think I was lying here?
- You don't remember what you did.
You didn't have any idea what you were doing last night.
- How could you?
- But I did.
"Give me a little credit, Captain."
"I may be a rummy, but I'm no dummy."
The army provides you with a home and a career.
This from the man who built himself wings... and tried to flap his way back to the States?
Now the army's my best friend.
"I may get shot in the stomach, but I won't get stabbed in the back... not the way I did by that wife-stealer Gus Nagy."
Oh.
"So, you mean..."
You mean Laverne and Gus...
"[Bawling] Oh, Laverne!"
Klinger.
Klinger.
"Klinger, come here."
Get-Get up.
Look-Look.
You're gonna get over Laverne in a little while... but that's no reason to throw away the best years of your life.
- I haven't.
- What do you mean?
"Well, it's not official until I raise my right hand and Col. Potter swears me in."
The universe is cold and unfeeling.
The only constant is chaos.
Was that place out of chocolate-chip pancakes again?
We were all almost killed by a truck.
Ay!
Idios mío!
"Are you okay, papi?"
"This was all Phil's fault, wasn't it?"
He's always blaring that damn new wave music!
No.
He swerved to avoid it.
Saved my life.
But the game of life is rigged.
Death always win.
"Okay, I know what you need right now..."
A trip to the ice-cream shop.
He doesn't need ice cream.
He needs to talk about what just happened to him.
"Well, I could go for some ice cream."
I know how to fix my son.
"So, this is fixed."
Go around.
"Normally, I'd be avoiding these cracks out of respect of your back, mom, but after today, it seems pointless."
- That's it.
Get in.
"- No, no."
"No, Jay, he's afraid!"
It's only gonna get worse.
In.
Trust me.
"Five minutes in here, he'll be happy as a clam."
Aah!
"Well, call me Sister and I'll return it to you."
Yes or no?
- Give it to me!
- Call me Sister!
How can you bite me!
Let go!
"Xiamu,"
I have a question for you.
"You still remember, don't you?"
The last time you saw your mother face?
Good!
"You may cry, scream and hit me!"
You're not a dummy anymore!
I knew you are scared.
"Every night you scared, aren't you?"
But have you even thought about... if the way you are now is what people want to see?
"As of today,"
Sister will accompany you.
You cannot just stay in this house.
You have to try going out.
"To learn about this world again, to feel the sunshine, to feel the wind."
"To feel the crowd,"
to feel how people care about you!
When did you come?
You want to play?
Yes.
- Who is this kid?
- He is my private tutor student.
Superb!
Right?
Sort of.
He is quite good.
And so will you.
It's time to go.
You think we could stop by the hospital on the way to downtown?
I can't.
Kyle will panic if I'm not there when he wakes up.
I spoke with your wife.
She's at the hospital.
You don't understand.
"When Kyle got sick, he asked me what happens when you die."
And I told him it was...
"I told him it was peaceful, like going to sleep."
And he was afraid to go to bed so... so I promised him... that I would be there to wake him up.
I have to be there.
Please.
"MERCY GENERAL HOSPRTAL KYLE McGOVERN'S ROOM THURSDAY, MARCH 17"
"Hey, Kyle."
Your mom's in the cafeteria.
Where's my dad?
He asked me to be here when you woke up.
Why didn't he come?
"Kyle, your dad loves you very much."
He'd do anything in the world to make you well again.
But... he did something wrong.
Did he rob a bank or something?
/ No.
Did he hurt anybody?
He broke the law.
He broke the law to get you a kidney.
He was just trying to help you.
So...
why is that wrong?
"John, what you did took a lot of balls."
Guys!
"We found the perfect spot for the mosque, but it's going to get torn down."
"Ann, you have to stop it!"
"I don't know, Amaar!"
It seems like an awful lot of work.
It's the old schoolhouse at the edge of town.
"Yeah, it's probably rubble by now."
"No, Rayyan's keeping it safe for now, but you have to save it."
Amaar!
"We are in big trouble, which actually proves my point, but that's not the issue right now."
- What are you talking about?
- Mayor.
"Baber, Amaar, you two responsible for that van outside, right?"
"Huh, yeah, I guess so."
Why?
Oh!
"Cuff me, I won't resist."
"Just don't tase me, bro!"
Why would I cuff you for parking in a handicap spot?
Illegal parking?
"Oh, good!"
Because I thought
You were here because of the bomb in the back of the van.
- Ha!
Ha!
Ha!
- Wha..
"- Well, now you're under arrest."
- You can't arrest him!
-
- I'm afraid the law says otherwise.
"- Oh, come on, Paul!"
"Oh, man."
"I freaked out and thought I was gonna have to get my tendon resoldered, but it didn't happen."
- You can't fool around with that stuff.
- No.
Didn't mean to.
- I think this was a reshoot day.
- No.
Didn't we...?
Didn't we reshoot the...?
"Oh, it's a different moment in the van."
It's when I'm looking out the window at Tris on the car.
"- Yeah, that was a reshoot."
- That was a reshoot.
Because I remember...
Remember Raf and I were giving each other a hard time this day.
Do you remember?
It was the reshoots and I was a little scared.
"I was like, ""Oh, my gosh."
"He's really getting angry."" I think I was making fun of his accent."
That's the way to get him mad.
Michael would make fun of Raf.
He'd be like:
"""Oh, later on, Rafi Gavron."""
Rafi's from London.
"You can't tell by the movie, but he's English."
"Oh, and Ari this is the best deli."
Remember?
- I wasn't in this scene.
I came to visit.
"- Yeah, but you came to visit us."
"We got Tony, our script supervisor, a cake because it was his birthday."
Of course.
Yeah.
- Change your mind?
- Enough of this.
"You want to deal, you deal with me."
You leave Lucy out of it.
Done.
Lucy has no more to fear from me.
You see?
I can be reasonable.
"Of course, I still have a job to do, and the next target will have to be Sam or Fiona or-"
I know.
Mommy.
"Sooner or later, I'll find someone you care about more than Doug."
So you call me when you want it to stop.
"She's not leaving town, is she?"
That'd be a no.
"If she knows all this about you, she'll probably come here."
She won't play this out on my turf.
She'll keep the pressure on until she gets an opening.
I
- I can't believe this.
"I'm a C.P.A., for Christ's sake."
C.P.A. brought down Al Capone.There's a reason why the feds want you to testify.
I say we hunt her down.
Ammunition's cheap.
"Fi, if we go out there without a plan, we're exposed."
She's more than happy to keep killing people until we hand Doug over.
She can come after me.
I'm ready.
Yeah?
- What about Sam?
"- I'm game, Mike."
Oh!
[groans]
"Boy, if Dad could see you now."
I am doing what he asked me to do.
I'm trying to help you.
I know you want the bonds.
- I can give them to you.
- And why would you do that?
Were you not listening?
That blood could satisfy your need to kill.
And what if I like to kill?
Do you?
"Look, what's the catch?"
You let Freddie go.
And I get to come with you and help you through this.
Are you out of your mind?
You seriously trust that Carlos won't just eat you the first chance he gets?
I don't trust him.
I trust you.
"I know you'll protect me, Scott."
[rock music plays]
"[Eddie] How did you get Seth to give you the plans, anyway?"
[Richie] Let's just say I convinced him.
[exhales]
"It's a little fancy, don't you think?"
I'm workin'.
[Richie sighs]
"Hey, listen."
I'm sorry I had to twist your arm about all this.
"What, are you kiddin'?"
I'm back!
"But if you ever try anything like that again, I'll kill ya."
And your... pathetic tantrums threaten us all.
Hmm?
This is not me accepting.
This room here on the left will be your room.
"On the right, take note, is the bathroom, if you need to wee-wee or something else."
"Now, this here is your room."
Isn't that fantastic?
I think there is a game of Buckaroo downstairs.
One of the other guests must have left it behind.
- Bucka-fucking-roo?
- Yes.
It's a fantastic game for two to eight players.
"Oh, for... forget it."
I was just trying to think of things to keep you occupied.
I can keep myself occupied.
"Oh, God, you're a teenage boy."
Of course you can.
- Hello!
- Shit a brick!
Don't you knock?
"Oh, no, I don't have to."
Being dead has some perks.
Not with me.
I don't want ghosts popping up all over the place.
It freaks me out.
You're a 46-year-old vampire who dresses like a child.
Don't call her freaky.
Up.
"Anyway, just, er... came to see how you boys are getting on."
Uh.
Badly.
Ah.
You proceed.
- Nothing else. I've said it all.
What happened?
-Her complaint is that he teased  and whistled at her.
-l didn't!
Did you whistle?
- Actually...
"Did you whistle, or not?"
"- Yes, I did."
But not to her.
I swear.
- Then why?
I am a music buff. I like to fiddle with instruments.
He also broke into a song on seeing me.
What was that?
"""Me and you in a locked house"" ""And..."""
"""And... the keys not to be found"""
Constable...
Lock him up.
Tomorrow is court-day.
Make sure the keys to the lock-up don't vanish.
You can file your complaint.
I would like to tell you something.
"Yes, tell me."
It's our duty to arrest and teach a lesson to such third class loafers.
And we do it.
"But, there are some duties ofwomen too."
Like what?
I don't get it.
Just look at yourself.
Ifyou roam about in these kind of dresses... ..do you think instead ofwhistles you will hear the temple bell?
What's wrong with this dress?
Joe The Greek and Frank Pignattaro.
They don't pay Fanucci.
"If they don't pay Fanucci, then somebody else collects for Maranzalla!"
We'll all be better off if we pay him.
Don't worry.
Now what I say stays in this room.
"If you both like, why not give me $50 each to pay Fanucci?"
I guarantee he'll accept what I give him.
"If Fanucci says $200 he means it, Vito!"
I'll reason with him.
Leave everything to me.
I'll take care of everything.
I never lie to my friends.
Tomorrow you both go talk to Fanucci.
He'll ask for the money.
Tell him you'll pay whatever he wants.
Don't argue with him.
Then I'll go and get him to agree.
"Don't argue with him, since he's so tough."
How can you get him to take less?
That's my business.
Just remember that I did you a favor.
Is it a deal?
Yes.
His family's out of the house.
Fanucci's alone in the cafe.
"Vito, here's my 50 dollars."
Buona fortuna.
Are you sure he's going to go for it?
I'll make an offer he don't refuse.
Don't worry.
It looks like there's - $ 100 under my hat.
Play it.
- Will you have a cigarette?
"- No, thank you."
"- Will that be all, sir?"
"- Yes, that's all."
Thank you.
You do that again and I'll take you across my knee.
"Well, are you ready?"
Thanks.
"Well, thanks very much for lunching with me."
- I'll call for you in about an hour.
- Thank you too.
- I'll see you later.
Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
"- Oh, just a moment!"
- What do you want?
I'm in a hurry.
I wouldn't annoy Miss Lowman again if I were you.
What right have you to interfere?
Are you a relative?
- No.
"- Then I have just as much right... to speak to her as you have, old boy."
"Nevertheless, I'm warning you."
"If you interfere with her, you'll get into trouble."
"Oh, I see then."
You're one of these government fellows.
Clever aren't you?
"Well, just keep away from her."
We Woosters never get enmeshed in the official dragnet.
- No?
"- Oh, no."
Go to the shop and bring back some beer.
Beer!
Why is he the one happy about it?
Bring back some soju too.
"You take care of it on your own, I don't want to get involved."
Then shall I tell them everything?
That there's someone else inside the body?
"If you do, I bet you'll get dragged to the hospital right away."
"If you don't want to get caught, then cooperate."
I'm sure we'll get caught.
I'm sure it'll show as more time passes.
"If it starts to get obvious, then you have to try to hide it!"
Hide what?
Uh oh...
See?
It's already starting.
What are the 2 of you hiding?
Kids don't have to know.
Don't get involved in an adult's conversation.
"Let's go, Yoon Jae."
"You, kid don't have to know!"
She said a kid doesn't have to know.
Come have a seat over here.
-Da Ra!
Da Ran!
"-Yes, mom."
Be good.
What?
If it's uncomfortable...
Do you want me to get you a pair of socks?
That's okay.
This is comfortable.
I should've killed that bastard.
"- What are you going on about, Louise?"
"- It's only a song, Bosco."
A story about wreckers.
There are no wreckers nowadays.
It's just a song.
As long as it's just a song.
I don't want to hear your damn song!
It makes me sick!
Bloody hell!
There's a curse on this village.
The demons are free.
What did you see?
Tell me!
There were two ghosts.
They were staggering about.
"Pale and covered in blood, with crazed eyes."
- There were two women.
- Where did you see them?
"Over there, by the ship cemetery, near the haunted ruins."
"Come with me, you two."
Hurry
The devil has been set free!
God help us.
He has been imprisoned in the ruins for centuries.
Now he is free.
Misfortune is upon us!
I can sense that he's still in the ruins!
Maybe now his long wait will be over.
They're here.
We must drive them out.
They won't come out alive!
Are you building a case to keep Brandon away from me?
No.
What are you... ?
Then why are you pumping Dani for information?
"You know I fell off the wagon, why not just come to me, Stef?"
I wasn't pumping Dani for...
"You didn't just drink, Mike, you got into a fight."
- You had blood on your hands.
- So what?
You afraid I'm gonna hurt Brandon or something?
"No, Mike, I'm worried about you."
I'm fine.
Ok?
- I'm getting it together.
- Where'd the blood come from?
It's stupid.
I got into a fight.
At the bar.
"Some guy was bothering the waitress, and..."
I must have broke his nose.
It was bleeding like crazy.
So you did...
So you didn't see Ana that night?
Is that what this is about?
You think it was her blood?
"You were so mad at her, Mike."
"Which is why I stayed away, just like we talked about."
"Yeah, you didn't talk to her?"
You didn't see her at all?
You didn't try and scare her off so she wouldn't turn Brandon in... ?
"Stef, I swear."
"I did not talk to Ana,"
Come on in.
"Hey, you want a beer?"
Or an apple martini?
"Oh, that's funny."
[ALEX LAUGHS]
Have you told your parents?
It's for work.
I'm trying to expand my client base.
By pretending to be gay?
"No, by being more gay-friendly."
"Or, in real estate terms, ""gay-adjacent."""
Nice.
I'm gonna use that.
I should change this.
It's maybe a little much.
I don't know.
"Dressing like that, seeing a girl who won't sleep with you I think you can pull it off."
"It's not that she won't sleep with me, douche bag."
I have slept with her.
"It's just she, you know..."
Won't sleep with you anymore.
"Pretty much, yeah."
What do you think?
"I think you got a problem because you're gonna have to beat them away with a stick, you gorgeous, sexy man."
Holy shit.
Observe your breath.
"Inhale, belly rise."
"And exhale, belly fall."
Bring your hands together in front of your chest.
Bow your head in gratitude.
- Namaste.
- Namaste.
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.
- Do you want to go get a drink?
"- No, I'd better not."
- Want to grab a bite to eat?
"- No, I'm not hungry."
- Want me to take you home?
- Okay.
"- Good to see you, Henry."
"- But Greg, you said..."
"Bye, Henry."
"- Candy, don't leave."
- That was great.
I thought you were gonna stay.
"Well, we're done."
Is my shoe here?
"Well, Candy, I still have feelings for you."
But I dumped you for another man.
How could you still have feelings for me?
"- Besides, I'm still sort of with Paul."
- I thought that was over.
"Well, he was cheating on me."
I guess I wanted to feel better about myself before I see him tomorrow night.
That's why you're here?
"Well, yeah."
"Look, you were always such a nice guy, but let's face it, we have nothing in common except sex and the fact that you idolize me."
I really do care for you.
Really.
I just can't wind up with you.
Can I call you sometime?
What for?
"- Rose, are you going, or what?"
"The AST, the ALT..."
It's eight times over normal.
Yeah.
He was doing so well.
He said his last scan was clear.
I did a flawless job on that glioblastoma.
I can't help it if the damn thing had already spread.
The LFTs suggest metastasis to the liver.
God.
Never even got a chance to start the antiviral protocol.
I just wish I wouldn't have held out that hope.
He's gonna go fast.
"So, uh..."
Who's gonna tell him?
Oh.
Thank you.
Yeah.
I'll be back to check on you.
"Yeah, I know, I know..."
Low platelets.
I'm surprised it hasn't happened before.
When's the transfusion?
"Well, just say it."
Your LFTs were through the roof.
You're sure?
We'll do an abdominal sonogram just to be certain.
Cancer has spread to my liver.
Yes.
How long do you think I've got?
Not long.
- We'll make you as comfortable as possible.
"- No, no, no, no, no, no,"
- Okay.
Where you going?
- Subway.
- I thought we were gonna walk.
It's 15 blocks.
"Come on, I think you'll like it."
- Do they allow hot dogs in the subway?
- You are so an out-of-towner.
Excuse me.
Hi.
I'm one of the graduates.
Wow.
You're hours early.
I just wanted to beat traffic... and have time to get ready and relax and also I've heard... the early bird gets the unwrinkled gowns without the mysterious stains.
- This is true.
Take your pick.
- Thank you.
This is so exciting.
Isn't this exciting?
This is my eighth year of doing this.
So not so exciting for you.
Got it.
You're being so cryptic.
Do you need a power source or not?
My batteries are all fully charged.
It just depends on how fast they deplete.
- So we need one just in case.
- Mom.
"Lorelai, it's hours before the ceremony."
What are you doing here?
"I'm sorry, what are you doing here?"
How do you even know about this?
"That's why I brought you along, just in case."
But we didn't come to fight.
We came to burn railroad bridges.
"If you don't like the plan, you're free to drop out now."
"If you come, you'll do it my way."
[train bell]
- Cloudin' over.
- Yeah.
Is it gonna rain?
Might could.
"It rains one minute, shines the next."
[conductor] All aboard!
[train whistle]
"- Good morning, conductor."
- Morning.
Didn't you get on at Marietta?
You're the one who saved Xiao-Mei.
We owe you a lot.
"Oh, that's just my duty, it's nothing."
"Drink up, come on Mr. Jeng."
You could help this old fool.
"Thirst and respect, huh?"
"Mr. Wu, why did you say you were a fool?"
(laughing)
"If I tell you son, you'll still never know why."
(laughing)
"Oh yes, I understand you."
"Well, I feel like"
"I'm half drunk and half sober, half of me is mad and half of me a fool."
"I work half a day, and I get half day's pay."
Everything is just half and half again.
"(laughing) Well then, you would be half an old bald head and half a young man,"
- To our meeting.
"Oh, what a poison!"
Some friend you've got!
"No, actually he's a good man."
"Actually, he's not Georgian, he's Greek, though he lives in Tbilisi, he is a tennis coach."
"Excuse me, what's your name?"
- What?
- Your name.
Oh.
Maria.
And I'm Yuri.
Incidentally!
"I didn't drink that much, but it went to my head."
Let's have something to eat.
I was hanging about the station all day!
Very well.
"You take charge here, I'll go and procure some plates and forks."
Tanya!
Can you find some plates and forks for us?
There you go.
Thanks a lot.
Good girl!
"My dear, why do you keep coming and going?"
"You know, I couldn't understand how it could... how it could be that the door's locked but the man's gone!"
"You know, I thought I was going to die."
Let's have another shot.
Though I can't drink much.
"You know, when I drink, I get..."
I get kind of bad in the head.
Start singing right away.
The matchmakers came to me
On a skewbald mare!
"You can see that, right?"
"Yeah, I mean, you're obviously upset about what happened."
"I am upset, Luke."
I'm very upset.
I don't have to play these games.
Of course not.
This is fucking fucked up.
"It's what you said, Chris."
"""Truth or Dare, bitch!"" It's what you said to Felix!"
What are you trying to say?
- That I sent the postcard?
"- Well, I know I didn't send it."
"You bitch, you're gonna set me up, aren't you?"
- You're gonna tell him about the fight.
"- Calm down, Chris."
- Don't tell me to calm down!
- Chris!
Shut the hell up.
That arsehole is going to get us killed!
He says he didn't send it.
"He said, ""Truth or Dare, bitch."""
Did you?
It's not a secret.
Other people heard.
They could've passed it on.
"Yeah, but you're the one that said it."
So what if I said it?
Why the fuck would I write on a postcard for Christ's sake?
"- It's because I chucked you, isn't it?"
- What?
I said it was 'cause of the way you treated Felix.
I said that was why I was dumping you.
What good is your word?
What's he gonna do now?
He's lost everything he had.
"No great amount of money, Patricia."
"Oh, it isn't the money, father."
He had dreams.
"They're gone, perhaps... perhaps even his faith in himself."
- Everything.
- But the boys is young.
I'll think of something.
- I'll find a way to help him.
"- Oh, don't talk to me."
I don't wanna hear any more alibis.
I don't wanna see you.
"Oh, I didn't mean that."
I don't know what I mean.
"Well, I understand."
I-I have failed you.
- But if I could make amends..
"- Oh, what could you do?"
I might be able to arrange backing.
So he could go on with his production.
"Father, where would you get any money?"
I'll get it... someplace.
[ship horn blowing]
"Jason, when is the captain going to marry her?"
As soon as we're upon the high seas.
- You have the license?
- Right here in my pocket.
"Though I understand, we won't need it."
"While we are waiting, couldn't we go some place and snuggle?"
Snuggle?
Back in nome... it's important This goes well today.
Let me just do The ceremonial scoop.
After their miraculous haul On the river...
"Hopefully, big gold Right off the bat."
It's time for the kellys' First cleanup of the season.
Whoa!
- Look at that.
- Whoa!
Do you see that?
Today we're gonna Clean up the river gold.
"Yeah, the gold's Looking very clean."
That's awesome.
This is gonna prove I'm great at running things.
And increase our reputation In this town.
"I'm just gonna pour it, You guys count off the numbers."
It's gonna make me Feel good.

That's two.
Three.
3.812.
That's awesome!
"Yeah, no, it's good."
"3.8 ounces Is worth nearly $5,000."
This is what Team kris gets you.
Team kris gold.
You guys have to see now That I'm a great captain.
And things are gonna Go well underneath me.
We're not here to go On an adventure.
We're not here To have a great time.
We're just here to make money.
It's all about success.
I'll take you.
I just gotta make a quick stop first.
"You know what, when people say they need to make a quick stop, they usually mean at the bank or the store."
"No, thank you."
"You know what, this is for computer classes."
"Know why I should do this TV show, Lemon?"
I really don't.
To get you rich.
"'Cause you know if I'm on that TV show, it's gon' blow up."
How do you know I'm not rich?
Your teeth.
"You got to think like these strippers, Lemon."
They know the window of opportunity's only open for a moment.
You gotta get in when you're young.
Get the money and get out.
"Yeah, well, I'm not a sex worker, Tracy."
I don't have sex for a living.
Neither do we.
Neither do they.
"Yes, they do."
Where is my phone?
We are strong
No one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so lo-ong
He's got charisma.
"No, that's Charisma over there."
Girlie Show.
"Ken, send me a car, okay?"
What is your location?
"Dark Sensations, in the Bronx."
I wish you were here.
Mr. Donaghy does not get us showbiz people.
Okay.
The police said the safe was locked.
The old man held out on the fucking guy.
As plain as day.
"Carlos, you want another helping?"
Carlos?
Carlos?
- You want more ham?
"- Oh no, I'm fine."
Thank you.
See you in a couple of days.
"Mickey, wait."
"Carlos, there's someone I want you to see."
Let's go.
"Come on, help me clean up."
Sean:
"Six months ago he came to me and asked for a loan, to stay afloat."
He shouldn't have been in that position.
I shouldn't have given it to him.
"The thing is, this is not a small loan, 25 grand."
Yeah.
Come on.
"There's a bodega on every corner of the Heights, Carlos."
What makes Eddie's profitable?
Eddie!
Why is Eddie in debt?
Eddie.
"If he sells the place, I get my money back, and I'm not forced to have this conversation."
We both know he ain't gonna sell it.
We both know he ain't gonna be able to work it for quite some time... if ever!
"The way I see out of this, for all of us... is you take over."
"The bodega, it's a cash cow."
Call it a gut feeling.
"Oh, that's still annoying, you know."
What is?
You talking in riddles and intuition.
You never change.
Yeah.
So has he?
"You know, contacted you?"
I haven't seen or heard from James in 15 years.
"And, uh, the irony's not lost on me"
That you're the one who's asking.
Carol.
Carol.
Look at me.
"No matter what you think,"
I'm not the one who drove him away.
You made things intolerable for all of us.
"Well, if it--if it makes you comfortable to blame me,"
Then you should go ahead and blame me.
I don't care.
But the truth is that you made choices.
And the choices you made--you chose badly.
I'm not the one who disappeared.
"Oh, there it is."
How did I not know?
What?
What--not know what?
"Oh, stop it, Artie."
You're in town for whatever reason and you decide to twist the knife
For old time's sake.
Rub it in that I chose the wrong guy.
Right.
It's-
You know what?
This isn't a basement.
This is a nursing home.
I know something new we could do.
"Jackie, Donna, get naked."
The rest of you guys back off and give us some room.
"- Hello, friends of Fez."
- Hi.
Where's Nina?
She don't wanna hang out with me tonight.
She said she needed space.
- [All] Ooh!
- Uh-oh.
That's the same sound you guys made when I told you I was gonna grow my bangs out.
"Fez, when a girl says she needs space, that means that she's dumping you."
You don't understand.
She said it was her and not me.
- [All] Oh!
- That ain't good.
"- Oh, what's the big deal?"
"- Oh, man, I can't tell him."
"This is a job for someone who's cold, heartless and just inhuman."
"Jackie, go for it."
"Fez, when a girl says, ""It's not you, it's me""... what she really means is it's you."
- So I have really been dumped.
- [Hyde] Yep.
And here's another tip.
"When a girl says she just wants to be friends... it means she wants you to do stuff for her, but she's not gonna put out."
"So, you know, heads-up on that one."
Yep.
Women'll screw you over every chance they get.
- He's skin and bones.
I lost money on this one.
"But the price of the others went up by 200 liras, right?"
"Mr. Eduardo, it's going to be hard to win the war this way."
"Win or lose, I refuse to be trampled on."
"No, that's not an option."
Am I clear?
"No, no."
"They're too fat, too ugly!"
Too German!
"On top of that, they're too expensive!"
Am I making myself clear?
- It's unthinkable.
"- Alright, I understand."
There's no need to shout.
Fat is always useful.
We'll make soap out of them.
"Come, let's go."
They're going to turn these prisoners into soap...
That's their problem.
Tale a look at that.
Queen of the Skies.
"Queen of publicity, that's what she is..."
- What do you think?
"- Well, she's photogenic."
What did you say?
That they'll make soap out of them?
There's a shortage.
Soap is worth more than 200 liras a kilo.
and god knows people in Naples need it.
- You must be joking.
"- No, General."
–What's he moving'?
"–Just, you know, warehouse electronics, man."
"CDs, TVs, DVDs."
Same stuff as before.
Where's he keeping his stash?
Are you gonna hold this third strike over me for the rest of my life?
"I could lie to you, but I have far too much respect for you as a person."
"Yes, I am."
Here is your authorization to check Mackey's financial records.
Thanks.
Hope we don't find anything.
I just hope you find the truth.
"Hey, Joe."
It's Vic.
Can you believe I walked out on them?
"When they left, I thought it'd be easier."
I thought they'd miss me more than I'd miss them.
"Guess I'm the shithead, huh?"
–Stacy still on the swim team?
"–Yeah, I think so."
Yeah.
"Yeah, she, uh..."
Damn it!
I didn't want you to see me like this.
"–Broke, with nothing."
–What about your pension?
Damn lawyers for the civil suit ate it up.
–What about the stuff you took on the side?
–I guess I didn't take enough.
Always so careful.
Never wanted to get caught.
"–Joe, you can't live like this."
The men are still very jumpy.
A night on the grog will straighten them out.
Nature calls.
what do you think?
I think they started the party without us.
Who are you?
You do realize you only h have one shot?
Which means you'll only be able to kill one of us.
"And that whoever you do not shoot, will have to cut your throat before the other hits the ground."
Ready?
Let the show begin.
Stand your ground!
Stand your ground!
Gather 'round me here.
Captain taylor.
Mr. Crusoe!
I thought you'd forgotten us!
Are you gonna be leading us?
- I'll leave that to you.
- Right.
"I need to help a friend, but I'll be back."
It's coming from the jungle!
"Lancaster, unshackle the men!"
"Come on, pick up the muskets."
The prisoners are out!
"Arm yourselves, you drunken sods!"
They're in disarray!
Let's have at them!
Fire!
Reload!
No!
Hold your fire.
"He thought I was one of the guys that was trying to sell him out to, uh..."
"Well, to you."
He did all this to you?
Yeah -- with jumper cables.
"Tell me something, Mr..."
Sodor.
I have my sources at Mr. Schmidt's operation.
How come I never heard of you until now?
"He hired me on the qt, because he was always afraid of traitors."
And then you hacked the alarm system
"I set up in the Tampa warehouse, and then all of a sudden, I'm the traitor."
Sugar?
O-one sugar.
Just one?
Two.
"Listen, Schmidt was a paycheck."
I got no love for him.
I just want to go home.
And I can help you.
How can you do that?
"You want to catch this guy, right?"
I know where he lives.
You know where he lives.
Nobody knows where he lives.
Except me.
"I'm telling you, I was his secret weapon."
"In fact, the only place I ever met him was at his house."
"If you want to hit him, you got to hurry."
I just wish --
I just wish I could see that son of a bitch bleed.
Okay.
Give us his address.
"You bought it for him, give it to him!"
"I won't give him this one, I've underlined some sentences."
He'd ask why.
How many weddings should there be?
"Three more, three in a row."
All rather late today.
Seems to take a long time.
What's the time?
I don't know. I won't cook today.
Have you done your shopping?
Some of it.
Meat.
"Pay day's not until Monday, did you have enough for it?"
Monday?
Not till Tuesday.
This is sure to save us!
I thought it was Monday.
"No, Tuesday. lt's the fifteenth today, isn't it?"
"Tomorrow's Sunday the sixteenth, Monday the seventeenth..."
Then we'll have to have something left over from Sunday.
It's enough to make ends meet till Sunday and you'll still have...
"No, I've already bought chickens."
I bought chickens in the week.
"I had a look at the market today, there were very few there."
I don't buy them at the market.
I bought them in a shop.
"Look out, the next ones are coming!"
Get ready!
Put your foot there.
"Here's part of it, I'd add this."
"Ah, you've got it pinned already!"
Won't you try it on?
I know.
Hey.
Hey.
Welcome aboard.
Might I come aboard?
Yeah.
You remember the boat.
"Well, you know, I thought I did."
"- Or, you know, little..."
- But it's been a while.
You know that dock?
"Over there, there's a boat that looks just like yours."
NEIL:
Uh-huh.
- It's not yours.
"- No, that's not my boat."
- It's definitely not.
But there's a very nice gentleman living on the boat who invited me in for a white-wine spritzer.
"Oh, good."
Wasn't expecting visitors.
That's all right.
I just wanted to just come by and say thanks for helping yesterday.
"Beth, you know, I'm the same person."
I would do anything for you.
I just can't give you...
I just can't give you what you want.
You're what I want.
Our life together is what I want.
I miss it.
I miss you.
You see those guys my sisters are married to...
"You're more of a husband to me, not being married than those real husbands are ever gonna be, and..."
"Oh, the police station said he would be here."
You've just missed him.
Oh.
Are you OK?
"Um, maybe you could help."
"Um, do you think we could talk inside?"
Sure.
It might be nothing.
We had this guy hanging around the garden centre.
"Elly, our receptionist, saw him across the road two days before Henry Elliot was killed."
Did you confront him?
"To be honest, um, I was afraid."
"Ah, I know him."
"He's this guy I was at college with, we did the same philosophy course."
This bloke called Paul Fordyce.
Paul Fordyce?
Yes.
Do you know him?
The police are already questioning him.
"What, in connection with these murders?"
"I thought he was weird, but not a killer."
I can't talk about the case.
You'll have to talk to the police.
You don't think he's after me?
"Well, I don't know."
"Ah, can you think of any reason why he might be?"
No!
"Ah, I, I hope not."
I haven't seen him since college.
I didn't have you down as an academic.
"No, I, I'm not."
Which is why I left.
Hey.
Hey.
You won?
No brig time.
You on a break?
"No, we're done."
You lost?
They said that my marriage to Mustafa was valid.
No.
"You don't have to go back, do you?"
"No, I divorced him."
I gave back the mahr.
The money from the villa.
Divorced?
Just like that?
"Oh, Islamic law has some interesting wrinkles."
"So you and I, we're not really married?"
We can be if you take this.
My mahr.
Your phone card?
There's almost $12 on it.
It's all I have.
"Yes, I will marry you."
"You know, it still may take some doing to keep her in the country."
"Well, she's officially an adulteress now so she can't go home."
That strengthens our asylum claim.
"Well, I give you exhibit A."
"Judge sees that, can't hurt."
"Here you go, gentlemen."
So what are we drinking to?
Women who appreciate the truth.
Let me know when you find one.
- What?
- Get up.
How do you know Emma?
- The name's August.
- (DOG BARKING)
"And it's a long story, but trust me, you wanna hear it."
"All right, August."
You're not a cop.
Who are you?
You got two minutes.
Think of me as Emma's guardian angel.
Guardian angel?
I see you've been doing a pretty crap job.
I've been looking for her for the past two years.
"Now I finally find her, and she's robbing convenience stores with some deadbeat."
Tell me again who's doing the crap job?
Let me tell you something.
I'm the best thing that's ever happened to her.
Two years?
Where were you the rest of her life?
I'm not perfect.
This world?
Full of temptations.
"Turns out, I'm not that great at saying no."
Not built that way.
But I'm here now.
So who are you?
We were in the same home as kids.
"And I thought she'd be safe inside the system, but now that she's out..."
"Back then, I promised I would take care of her."
"Well, we promised to take care of each other."
You love her.
Okay ?
You don't know how to fix this.
You can't fix it!
You...have no clue...
Just leave me alone.
I don't ever want to hear from you again.
Wake me up when the latch turns.
But what if ...
"This isn't exactly the residence of a renegade, Daze ."
But...
Just keep a lookout while I go dream about a dress.
Him
"Oh my God, is that the guy?"
What's going on ?
I don't know !
Why didn't he take our guns ?
I don't know !
Should we wake him or just pop him ?
"I don't know, Daze ."
"Hey, girls."
There's stuff in the kitchen if you're hungry.
Do you know why we're here ?
"Yes, I've been expecting you."
I think there must be some sort of misunderstanding.
"We're not here to clean your bathtub, or organise your closets or make you happy."
Really?
Yea.
We are here to kill you.
Then there's no misunderstanding at all.
Do you mind if I've a word with my partner ?
Wait a second.
"Search him, Daze."
Yeah Sir?
"I am going to tease her, you beat me."
With hand or with leg?
With leg.
With left or with right leg?
Whatever just beat me!
Whatever just beat me!
"With both leg, or i will kill you i am going to tease her."
Coming?
My room or yours?
What?
"Hey listen, come!"
"Sorry, i am not that type of person."
Even i m not that type of women.
Don't you have brother or father?
"Why you are showing attitude, see its off season, i will give you 50°/° off."
The girl is teasing Papa.
Come...
someone help!
Come... someone help!
Okay whatever you say i will do.
"Okay whatever you will give me, i will take it."
You don't have manners you are teasing the person who is like your mother?
No... no...
he is not teasing me... beat me hard.
What are you doing he is my customer.
"Why you are not beating me, ., come-on do it."
"Leave him, he is my customer."
Why you are beating him?
He was teasing a women.
Women?
He was teasing a women!
Yeah?
Let's just hope this lady coming up the stairs now feels the same way about that as you do.
I felt good about this guy as soon as I saw him.
LISA:
"Me, too."
( knock on door )
Answer it.
Come on.
"Out of the way, Dr Penzler."
Let me see her.
Are you the one who asked for the FBI?
( scoffs ) Yeah.
I'm here.
You can talk to me.
Did anyone tell you what this was all about?
Man in therapist's office holding ten hostages demands FBI agent.
I asked for someone from the FBI extraterrestrial project.
Someone who knows about aliens.
"You mean, like on X-Fiies?"
I'm the one you want.
RAY:
Okay.
Let me bring you up to speed on our situation here.
I shot him.
And he's gonna die if he doesn't get medical attention.
That's one.
"After that, if I don't get what I ask for, these people, they're just fish in a barrel to me, you understand that?"
"That was the lady in the park, the one who tried to grab me."
RAY:
You understand?
This is what I want you to do.
I want you to go public.
What shall I tell him about Malcolm?
Just tell him!
It is 1969!
For frig's sake!
What it is...
That's not really a sentence.
Thank you for the photo.
No trouble.
"The other day, when I said I was going out with somebody,"
"I wasn't really, so, I don't know if you want to still go out with me."
"Well, I can't just decide on the spot."
I will have to think about it.
"No, of course."
Absolutely.
I've thought about it.
"Yes, I would and where shall we go?"
Oh.
You really want to?
You've no idea.
You have no idea.
Wow!
Crikey!
"I ordered sausage, egg and chips to cheer myself up."
I could send it back!
Could I hold your hand?
Yes.
Hang on!
Let's do this thing properly.
"So, none of my beeswax, but I am a man, so, obviously, a bit thick as regards these matters."
Were you going out with somebody or not?
"Well, I was seeing somebody."
"We didn't really go out, and I haven't actually told him yet."
You really showed those bastards.
This is Hidalgo.
He fought in the underground once upon a time.
Once upon a time indeed.
"I infiltrated the city, but some bastard betrayed me."
I assume you haven't told them where Carrasco is or anything like that.
Silveira and I aren't such good friends that I would confide any secrets to him.
They'll wait for you to recover before they torture and drug you again.
"Watch out, they're coming."
"Come on, get into your beds."
Hurry up.
Gosh!
Let's see what delicious food we're getting today.
- Minced shit!
You know I don't eat shit.
- Shut up!
Why don't you eat this yourself?
Pigswill for pigs!
I've had it with you!
Who's a pig?
Tell me.
Who's a pig?
- You're the pig.
Say yes.
"I said, say yes!"
- Yes.
Stop it!
Are you trying to kill him?
"Come on, let's go."
- Come on now.
- You see how things work here.
No jokes!
I should've been straight with him.
I should've stood by him.
"And we should've remembered the code that he taught us, 'cause without that code, we'd be... long gone right now."
Amen.
Which is why we're gonna do this job.
For Uncle Eddie.
We're gonna kill the son of a bitch who did this.
And then we're gonna rob him blind.
"Yeah, well, first things first."
- What?
- We're gonna do this... we get it all on the table.
Full disclosure.
You can't be a part of this crew unless you know everything.
"Go ahead, you two."
Show her what you really are.
- What?
!
[gasps] - [roaring] [people screaming]
- [moans] - [screaming continues]
[panting]
[Scott] Boss...
What are you doing?
Getting a taste for what's coming.
"Okay, I got the bonds, but she's coming with us."
[chuckles]
Perfect timing.
You're about to see the rise of a new Lord.
"Go ahead, kid, knock yourself out."
You deserve it.
"- I'm sorry, I..."
- It's not your fault.
I don't know how he found me.
It's all good.
I'm happy.
I'm very happy.
"well, get off the phone then before I start crying."
All right then.
Okay.
Love you.
See you.
-talk to you later.
"AII right, bye-bye."
-Bye.
t's amazing man.
That's literally why I auditioned for the show in the start.
"Like, I just wanted to be able to give back to my mum and stuff."
So it's wicked to be able to do that.
It's really cool.
Tonight is the biggest show we've ever done.
I'm just throwing it out there.
"e are playing to 65,000 people tonight."
It's just insane.
Good luck.
Look at the amount of policemen...
-...we've got.
-I can't get over how many police bikes there are.
They've got 40 policemen on us and then they've got like 1 000 policemen on the streets.
"It's quite scary, but it's quite fun at the same time."
We literally have like a small army.
We do have the army.
Let's take over this place.
What is that girl doing out the top of the car?
With an english hat on.
She is a literal rebel.
You're not sure.
"I'm sure, Lena."
I know.
I feel them.
"- Oh, Saul."
- We close the shop today.
I don't know how he keeps pullin' that mess off.
"- Yeah, well, neither does he."
- Hm?
"It's all in the subconscious, TC."
- Haven't you heard of body language?
- Body language?
The body can tell you all kinds of stuff without you even knowing.
"You don't believe me, huh?"
You see the way he's lowering' his head?
"The body's saying he's vulnerable, and the ladies love it."
Watch.
"Any second now, she'll throw her arms around his neck and bury her head right in his chest."
Huh!
"Well, for a guy that don't know what he's doin', he sure do it good."
Wuh-oh.
"Hey, she got a little body language of her own."
"Yeah, well, that's obvious."
"- Thanks for the coffee, Rick."
- OK.
"Take care, TC."
"Shouldn't have lowered your head, boy."
Shouldn't have lowered my head?
"Why is it when I find out what people hire me to find out, they take it out on me?"
"I don't know but, here, put some ice on it."
That's very funny.
"Hey, Saul."
"Linda, pick any wine."
It can even be a wine he knows.
Any wine?
"If you can get one wine right, just one, you win the whole competition."
"In fact, you could pick a wine he had last night."
I'll still know it before he does.
"Ooh, bonus round."
"Whoever says what it is first, wins."
What's the point?
"You can do this, Bobby."
"No, I can't."
"Look at me, Bobby."
I-I can't.
Yes you can.
I have a blindfold on.
"Well, you can do the mystery wine."
"All right, fine."
Pour it.
At least I'll get drunk-ish.
"That's it, Bobby."
"Hey, look what's coming around the mountain."
The train.
"Just kidding about the mountain, uh, but the train is..."
remember that song?
Uh-oh.
"Guys, she's coming back faster."
This only happens when the train's running behind schedule or this one time when they ran out of rosé and things got weird.
It's starting to look kind of like a real train now.
"Like fast, and dangerous."
We could just get a cab.
"Oh, look, there's Ethan."
He's headed toward the Juice Caboose!
Good.
That means you have to do right by her.
That's all I'm trying to do.
Then leave her.
Never.
She has a destiny and you?
This life?
You're gonna keep her from it.
"Okay, you believe in magic?"
I take it you do.
So will you.
Trust me.
I'm gonna show you something.
Something that's gonna make you look at everything differently.
"And when you see what I have in here, you're gonna listen."
You're gonna believe every word I say.
(LID CREAKS)
"Yeah, right."
(SNIFFS)
"Okay, I'm listening."
There is a curse and it needs to be broken.
Emma is the key.
I was tasked with keeping her on track.
"And you, my friend, just got caught in the crossfire."
Now I'm gonna tell you a story.
"And at the end of it, you're gonna have to make a decision, will you do the right thing or not."
"So, are you ready?"
(BEEPS)
(ERROR SOUND)
WOMAN: (RECORDING) The number you're trying to reach is out of service.
If you think you've reached this message in error...
- (BEEPS)
"Um, I don't know, Mike, what do you think, is it safe?"
"Yeah, it's all right, go ahead."
But don't go too far.
Thanks.
Bye.
Anybody home?
[flies buzzing]
"You know, you just can't come walking in to somebody's motorhome like this."
"Sorry, Mike."
mom?
Yeah.
"Hey, what's the matter, Billy?"
Never mind.
Is it mike?
Do you like him more than Dad?
"Billy, I like them both in different ways."
"I'll always have strong feelings for your dad 'cause he gave me you, didn't he?"
"Yeah, well, Dad's better looking, and he's smarter."
"Well, Mike's real smart too, he really is."
Are you going to marry him?
I don't know.
"A whole lot depends on you, partner."
"If you do, we have to move to Arizona, and I'll miss my friends, and I'll never see Dad."
"Well, you'll see your father."
"He'll come down all the time and you can go up and visit him, really."
"You like him, don't you?"
"Yeah, I do."
"Billy, just promise me that you'll give Mike a chance."
"I mean, that's all he wants."
"Well, I'll try."
That's all I wanted to hear.
I love you.
Me too.
I'm glad you came.
How can anyone live two years in a place like this?
"The bathroom's clogged, no water, it's disgusting!"
"I'm used to it, but you don't have to be."
"I can't allow you to live in a place like this, you go home tomorrow, there's a train at 9."
"No, I'm yourwife."
- I'm staying here with you.
- But Chicco?
- He has to become independent.
- As of when?
As of now.
"When we're organized, we'II bring him here to live."
"We're a family, we have to stay together."
"It would be wonderful, but I can't allow it."
What's that?
"It's the neighbors, they fight all the time."
Not anymore.
hold me.
But you leave tomorrow.
- Think they're asleep?
- Warrior's rest.
- Let's go home.
"- No, I have an idea."
"We end with a blast, Iet's burn down the town hall."
Aren't you coming?
"No, I have to bodyguard his wife."
Goodnight.
Why don't you stay here?
Be serious.
"It's the first time we've been alone, even Mom's not here."
"It's all pretend here anyway, right?"
"Stop, I said."
Get out.
Now!
Everything started on that day?
I'll try speaking to the Father.
What you're telling me is true?
Yes.
And you said the shaman told you this.
"From their perspective, a ghost is the spirit of a dead man."
But that man is alive.
"I've heard about this man, too."
Rumor has it he's a renowned professor.
"And there are darker, more disturbing rumors-"
Some say he's a Buddhist monk.
But they're just rumors.
How can you believe them?
"No, Father."
They're definitely not rumors.
You sound terribly sure.
Did you see it with your own eyes?
How can you be sure without seeing for yourself?
Take her back to the hospital.
Trust the doctor.
There's nothing the Church can do for you now.
Come with me to the Jap's.
Sorry?
I gotta see for myself if he's really a ghost or not.
"If he is, then I won't be able to kill him."
Where is he?
Is everyone here?
Yeah.
Why'd you call us so early?
Sit right down.
"Well, I..."
"Well, I'll just take a sip."
"- Of course, I shouldn't stay too long."
"- Oh, nonsense."
Nonsense.
You can stay as long as you like.
"After all, we have all evening, haven't we?"
Of course we have.
Here.
There.
"Oh, I like your singing."
Yes.
You must sing again for me sometime.
Where did you get such a pretty voice?
"Well, I don't know."
I just...
Perhaps it's the pretty place it comes from?
- Well...
"- Very lovely, where it comes from."
"- Well, here's health so good luck."
"- I make my own luck, my dear."
"Yes, and tonight I follow the rainbow."
"Oh, you don't half talk, do you?"
Perhaps we could follow it together?
"- I'll follow it right home, mister."
- To that rattrap?
"- Hey, what are you calling names?"
- I think you deserve something better.
How do you know where I live?
"Well, I can imagine."
Surely your wages here don't earn you a place in Barkley Square.
If you have the meetings in the evening... nobody wants to come out.
Everybody's just so afraid.
It's a question of what you people really want to do.
Do you want this community or what?
"Ted, I realize that we are the community."
That's right.
Nothing's going to happen until we do what I said.
Are you down with o.p.p.?
You know me.
I really do understand that.
We just can't go around...
Let's cross the street.
Put your hand down.
"- Hey, man."
- You want this?
What for?
I ain't crossing' the street for nobody.
"Leave me alone, Maxine."
"- Dad, come on."
"- Ted, don't be crazy."
- Are you scared?
"- Yeah, I'm scared."
I don't have to prove nothing to nobody.
"I want to see a hero, I'll rent Rambo."
"You go ahead on, then."
We got to get these young people involved in this.
What did I just say?
I said give me the green.
"You lucky that didn't break, old man."
"See you later, old man."
Don't see me later.
"See me now, punk... 'cause I ain't crossin' no street."
"How could you, Benigno?"
You haven't come back to freak out on me?
No.
Do you need anything?
I need information.
How's Alicia?
The staff is forbidden to talk to me.
"She's in another clinic, they don't know where."
I don't believe that.
"Neither do I, but I'm not surprised they won't tell us."
"Hey man, are you still my friend?"
"Of course, whom do you think I'm here for?"
Then find out what's happened to Alicia.
"If she's alive, if she had a baby, if it's alive..."
I need to know.
"You understand, don't you?"
Yes.
I'll tryto find out.
See you Saturday.
Did you find out anything?
"Not yet, but I will."
Be patient.
"I was patient until the baby was due, but that was a month ago."
You have to keep waiting.
Fuck!
What do you do here all day?
I work in the sick bay.
"The jail is new, so there aren't many people."
It's very quiet.
"From outside, it doesn't look like a jail."
Forget the jail!
My problem is not seeing Alicia.
"I nearly got the suspect, but he escaped."
Where's your razor sharp intuition?
Many people want me to fail... so this case means a lot to me.
I don't need you letting me down.
You always were a pain in the ass.
Do me a favor and prove me wrong.
"Sir, I do nothing for nobody."
I'll get the murderer.
You'll get your promotion.
I hope you don't forget who helped you reach the top.
I want you to draw the suspect.
Try to bring him to life.
He's over 30.
He looks determined... without being ruthless.
There's something heroic about him.
He doesn't look like a killer.
He comes across so calm... acts like he has a dream... eyes full of passion.
- Hello.
"- It's me,Jeffrey."
Jeffrey?
Why haven't you left town?
I want my money now.
I want it tonight.
Tonight!
"Sure, I'll bring it tonight."
Mr. Weng.
You should let me handleJeffrey.
He's my responsibility.
- What if he squeals on me?
- He wouldn't.
"I don't trust anyone, including you!"
I know the rules ofthe game.
"Oh, it's gonna be okay."
- She's going down.
- She's going down.
Don't touch her.
- Yeah?
"- Sir, I'm sorry to contact you directly, but the crowd is drooling for you."
"Yep, floor is wet out here."
"- Okay, great."
Thank you.
- Tom James!
Tom James!
I'm gonna go rally the rally.
"With all due respect, you need to get your shit together now, lady."
Ma'am up.
You're still the leader of the free world.
Hmm?
Where's Tom?
"Oh, he's gone to talk to the crowd at the rally."
- What?
- The fuck he has.
Why would you let him do that?
"- Well, you don't work here."
"- Well, neither do you."
"All right, fuck all of you."
I'm going to the rally.
"Ma'am, ma'am, that would be unprecedented."
"No, I'll tell you what's unprecedented, Kent."
A tie is unprecedented.
So is becoming the first lady president.
So is that jackoff becoming president through the back door.
Okay?
The rule book's been torn up now and America is wiping its nasty ass with it.
Did you get an address?
- I'm gonna send it to you now.
"All right, urn..."
- I'll see you there.
"- Yeah, see you there."
- You off to arrest someone?
- Yeah.
You're screwed then cos I'll do you for false arrest.
I had reasonable and probable cause to think you were committing a crime.
"- Listen, one more peep out of you..."
- (LAUGHS)
- ...and it's with intent to supply.
- You're a liar.
And you're a junkie hooker.
I'm a copper.
"Do that, would you?"
Stitch me up?
Yeah.
"In a millisecond, just to shut you up."
Do you even know what they'll do to me for this?
"They'll break my ankles, if I'm lucky."
Listen.
Look at me.
"Nothing's going to happen to you, all right?"
"Yeah, who says?"
You?
"- Yeah, me."
"- They do know where I live, you know."
"People like that, they always do."
Come on.
"Mark, I wouldn't do this unless I absolutely had to."
Do what?
What once was good is always good.
Then maybe we should translate in the meantime.
Is that possible?
"What do you mean, possible?"
"I mean, why don't you translate it?"
I need to think about it.
What do you say?
"I said, I'd think about it."
I have to get back to the theater.
I'm sorry this visit was so short.
"Bye, Goni."
- Bye.
I don't believe a word you say.
What?
You think I'll never get out of here.
So you come with this gesture of yours.
You just came to insult me.
"- Yitzhak, don't be ridiculous."
You liar!
Just like the last time.
"Daddy, calm down."
Drink.
Drink.
I brought your licorice.
I don't want licorice and any chocolate from that snake.
He's doing it because he feels bad.
- He feels fine.
"You're acting like an idiot, but do as you like."
"You cried in the middle of the play when I got beaten in ""The Fiddle""."
So what?
You were four and you were howling.
The cast stopped the play until Mommy took you backstage so you'd see I was okay.
I missed the exit.
I went all the way to Yong Moon.
-How could you go that far?
-I know right?
How can I go that far?
Who are we talking about?
Me.
-Why didn't you answer the phone?
"-I didn't bring it, you know."
I thought you got into an accident.
I was going out to look for a car accident.
You called all of the sudden and told me to leave in 10 minutes.
I was in a hurry.
3 minute shower. 3 minutes to change. 3 minutes to do hair.
-I left at the right time.
-I have to be back by office by 4:30.
You're an hour and 30 minutes late.
We only have an hour and 30 minutes left!
I said I'm sorry.
You can kill me ok?
"Just be positive, hmm?"
"Oh geez, we have an hour and half left."
It's only 10 minutes short from 100 minutes.
It's 10 times 9 minutes.
We even had 14 minute dates before.
When there was an accident in your office.
What do you have in your head?
"I made an absurd excuse to get out of meeting, so that I can see you here."
"10, 20, 30, 40 minutes."
You made me think that you were in an accident.
A big one.
I thought you were unconscious.
"Hey, fellas, what's up ?"
- Look at this stud.
"- What's up, man ?"
"Hey, playah."
"How you doin', man ?"
"Whass up, baby ?"
"Oh, no love."
No love.
I hear you been traveling in new circles.
What's up with that ?
- You tapping' that white girl ?
- [ All Laugh ]
That's why you ain't got more time for your boys?
Too busy fronting ?
"Too busy snow flaking. lf that's the case, you best be watching your back."
'Cause white women don't bring nothing' but trouble.
"That ain't white women, man."
That's women.
- That's your women.
"- Yo, are we gonna check out... some honeys on the westside ?"
- You riding ?
"- Hell, no."
This ain't about no honeys.
I know what it's about.
Those fools we stomped at Stepps hit my corner four strong last week.
- l gotta handle myself.
"- You slide out that side oftown,"
- they gonna handle you.
- They can bring it. I got my heat.
"All that gat's gonna do is create some unnecessary mayhem, man."
That's the black man's life-  madness and mayhem.
- How do you know ?
Why?
If the invalid eats one particular soup the maker's wish will come true.
Do you have a wish too?
"I have one, yes:"
to pass my exams.
I have another one too.
What is it?
I want Mrs Malek to get better.
- To get better?
- Yes.
Can you find us some milk for breakfast?
I don't have any cattle.
I'm alone.
Tell Farzad to fetch you some.
I don't understand...
"Ask the boy, he'll fetch you some."
"We're in the country, we'd like to consume local produce."
I don't have any.
I don't have any milk or cattle.
I have a lot of work.
Where are the people?
"Yesterday, walking around the village, I only saw children and old people."
The young men work the land.
They're farmers.
No one's idle here.
The old people and children stay in the village.
Where are the young people?
I just told you:
they're working the land.
The corn and barley are ready for harvesting.
The young people work for three months.
"In winter, they don't work."
But they've all been losers.
You know... boring.
They'd have to be.
My father had to approve of them all.
Old Dalt can't be that bad.
He must have done something right.
- Why?
"- Well, look how great you turned out to be."
"Oh, me?"
Come on.
I'm a total basket case.
You don't even know the half of it.
"No, no."
My intuition about people is very good.
I could tell right away you had your act together.
Yeah?
When did you decide that?
In the convenience store when we shared that look.
Remember?
Yeah.
Thought to myself only if life were different... maybe I could meet a girl like that someday.
- Really?
- Swear to God.
"Believe it or not, when I was holding the gun to your back..."
I couldn't help but notice how lovely your hair smelled.
- You're crazy.
- That would be affirmative.
"You know, you really hurt me with that gun."
- You didn't have to jam it into my back so hard.
- I'm sorry.
"About the gun, uh..."
- What?
- Yes.
- Why did you fire Pete?
- Why did you disappear all night?
Is this some kind of a power play?
"It's not so fun being hands-on with these bloodsuckers, is it?"
- Can we talk about this on Monday'?
"- No, I want Pete back."
I want it in writing that Jenna's job is safe.
And I want a cappuccino machine for the writers' room.
Fine.
I thought you were gonna quit.
"Yeah, you don't know everything about me."
You weigh 127 pounds.
Holla at your boy!
"Hey, you will be hearing from Peanut's lawyer."
"Good night, sleep tight."
I can't wait to do this with you every week.
Excuse me.
"There's a line, buddy."
There's two lines.
"No, no, there's one line."
We're in it.
I'm just getting a hot dog.
We're all getting hot dogs.
"What, you think there's two lines and we're all in this line-- you're the only genius that got in the other line?"
Can you believe this guy?
Don't line up behind him.
He cheated you.
"Hey, shut up."
"What do you want on yours, baby?"
"I want all the hot dogs, please."
"Don't tell the Vanderploots, they'll kick us out of the club."
"Richard, you know what I mean."
It was just a...
It was a surprise.
"I mean, we had so much stuff in common."
Yeah.
"You vacuumed once, didn't you?"
"Yeah, it was a long time ago."
She borrowed the Flintstones' vacuum.
It was an elephant on a stick.
- Yeah.
- You know what?
You guys should talk.
I've been in both of your bathrooms.
It's like a poodle lives under your toilet.
"Okay, look, sorry."
We're just trying to understand what the issue is.
There is no issue.
And you know damn well what the issue is.
I am not a snob.
I don't care about anything except what's in a person's heart.
"To me, she's just a person."
A very nice Portuguese person.
- That is a weird coincidence.
- I know.
"I mean, you don't hear about Portugal for, like, what, 30 years?"
"- And suddenly, you can't get away from it."
- Yeah.
"Wait, you don't wanna be friends because she's a maid?"
"No, I have to be friends with her."
You're gonna be friends with her because she's a maid?
"No, I wanna be friends."
Why can't you answer?
You've already said it.
I'm the devil.
Shaman
I'm almost there.
Where are you?
Are you home?
I'm with the woman now.
You mustn't let her tempt you.
Never.
"Whatever she tells you, you must go to your daughter now."
Do you understand me?
Understand?
Do you?
Is that your shaman?
Don't believe what he tells you.
They're in on it together.
Isn't that right?
You're already certain I'm the devil.
That's why you came here... carrying that sickle.
"My words, whatever I say- they won't change your mind."
No.
That's not true.
There's no doubt.
You came here to confirm your suspicions about me.
That's not true!
"If you say you're not the devil, and reveal your true form to me-"
I'll leave you alone.
"When the demon is snared, the rooster will cry three times."
Wait until the third cry.
You'll leave me alone?
Yes.
"The new, strange one?"
How many times have I told you?
I don't like it...
"I know, you don't like me looking at your works-in-progress, but I peeked."
It's weird.
"You know it's weird, because you never cover your paintings."
I'm going.
See you later.
Hon. I didn't mean to piss you off.
"Quit it, Charlie."
Get out of that.
"Damn it, Charlie, that's my dinner."
"Get out of there, Charlie."
Get out of there.
"Hey, help me up here, would you?"
My hip hurts a little bit.
I think you might have brushed me going by.
"Come on, fellow, help me."
Just a close call.
"I'm sorry, man."
I'm really sorry.
Quit gibbering and help me get up.
"I think I sprained my hip getting out of the way, and my back hurts a little."
"Oh, my God."
Did you really hit me?
"I can't deal with this right now, man, okay?"
I got 12 points and a DUI on my license already... and there's an ounce in my glove compartment.
What are you talking about?
Help me.
"It's not really primo stuff or anything, but an ounce is an ounce, right?"
"Besides, someone will come along pretty soon."
What the hell are you talking about?
They can stand by.
"And when we're ready for somebody, they can be there."
MAN:
"How are they gonna be there, Lloyd?"
They can be right in the back.
"And then when we call for them, they can be there, right?"
I'm sorry.
I've been making movies for a long time.
People can stay off the set and be
Available when they're needed.
There's a little bit of-
- I'm not
Quite sure how to describe it.
But you can interview some people on the set.
There was a little bit of that actress stuff
"Going on yesterday, I'm afraid."
But I think we managed to nip it in the bud.
"No, not at all."
And I didn't plan on not doing it.
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"Yeah, yeah, it's gonna be fine."
[High-pitched noise]
"If we don't shut this off, we won't"
"Be able to hear the church bells when they start going, see."
"OK, camera is ready."
"Quiet on set, please."
Standing by.
WOMAN:
No more bell ringers.
[Bell ringing]
ALL:
Aw.
Niels.
He's in the Netherlands for another day and a half.
I got your gun and we're going now.
You can't say no.
You owe it to Arie.
What do you want with him?
Have you been sent as a provocateur or something?
Bullshit.
It's exactly as I say.
Niels is in Amsterdam.
Put that thing away!
You can't be serious.
"Damn, you're serious."
-Of course.
"No, I'm not doing it."
So you risked your life for this mess.
I'm selling a lot.
-I bet you are.
I have to.
My son's studying medicine and I'm paying for everything.
"When he'll be finished, he won't have any debt."
What has really changed after the war?
The fascists are in power again.
Except they have a bigger mouth now and they're keeping the people stupid.
That's true.
-And what are they using to do it?
That nonsense that you're selling.
What did we say to each other back then?
Those bastards from the war will never know any peace.
Down with the fascists!
Or not?
You're good.
They know me now.
"Are you aware of that, bitch?"
"They know my fucking face, my name, probably how long my fucking dick is."
That goddamn kid!
Why didn't you tell me about that fucking kid?
I swear I didn't see any kid.
He must have been hiding real good.
Quit lying to me!
Don't hit me no more.
"Pluto, don't let him hit me no more."
"Get rid of her, Ray."
It will be okay.
"Oh, shut the fuck up."
We'll get rid of the car.
They're not going to find us.
"They're not going to find you, maybe."
They're not going to find us!
Get your goddamn hand off me.
(SOBBING) We're going to be okay.
CHARLIE:
"Isn't there another way around here, Dale?"
DALE:
Watch your step.
There's some rotten timbers up ahead.
I crashed my motorcycle on this bridge when I was 14.
DUD:
Is that right?
DALE:
They had to call the volunteer fire department to put it out.
You can still see some of the burn marks.
Perfect hideout.
You think the old man's there?
"No, Rihanna is out."
We cannot go to...
"We cannot be seen at a Rihanna concert, guys."
"No, I've got the perfect thermos."
We gotta hunt!
We have to go and kill something!
Hopefully not an innocent something.
I don't like killing innocent animals.
We'll pick on the animals that obviously deserve it.
First thing's first.
Let's go buy some guns.
What do you mean that there's a ten-day waiting period?
That doesn't seem real.
We have the right to bear guns.
I know that's a fact.
That's one of the commandments.
"Dude, it's the law."
"If a man disrespects you in a bar and pours a beer on your head, you have the right to shoot that man."
Shut up.
"God, gimme a gun!"
"Just gimme a gun, man!"
All right.
All right.
"So, we can't have guns."
"We just need weapons that can kill things, and money is no object."
"I've got a credit card, so let's make it happen."
- Do you have one of these?
- Mm-hmm.
It's pretty inten...
You should get one.
29.99 APR.
Not bad.
"You'll admit, as a secondary school teacher..."
The salary's also a deciding factor.
So cheap and good quality.
Bring something.
Here you are.
You pay in advance.
How much will it cost?
A hundred and twenty-nine.
It'll be the death of me.
"Hubert, and Extra at that - Sixty-six crowns!"
That's what we expected.
I must work out how much this dance of yours will cost.
That music's terrible.
"For that money no one... lf someone comes and asks you, don't go and dance."
This music. lt's awful.
Awful?
"What are you doing here, boys?"
"Dad, for heaven's sake stop that!"
"Do you mind, I know them."
"Okay, but you're not going to force anyone on me."
- Can't I introduce them?
"- No, that's not done."
Mi?
"ko, isn't your daughter dancing?"
"Not for the moment, maybe she will."
Don't you dance to this?
- She doesn't dance to this.
- And what will she dance to?
That's just what we needed!
What did we need?
This!
Did we need this?
But...
"I see other freelancers, they don't work this hard."
For normal freelance people that is true.
But I feel I can do more.
So why do I... have to be like other normal people?
I think your rash not going away has nothing to do with your job.
Make sure you take the bedtime pill.
I did.
"If you did, you'd be complaining about being sleepy."
Shit!
What do you think?
See!
It's okay.
It's as good as if you did it.
"Actually, Jerd is like you 5-6 years ago."
"People are saying he is Yoon 2, you know?"
So why did you ask me to come?
Wasting my time.
Adidas Japan.
I'll do it!
"Shit doc, I'm sorry."
That was automatic.
Good.
You get to work on an international brand finally.
I know you've been dying for this.
You know how hard it was to land this?
I need your best this time.
What's up with you?
Are you possessed?
"No, I was just thinking if I had anything else to do?"
"If you do, make sure to clear your schedule."
Make sure this is your first priority.
"Oh, no."
"I'm... too sleepy, I guess."
You ask Joe.
"Joe is probably hungry, though."
"Joe, you talk with Mother and dads."
They can help anybody.
"You see, mother and dads, Joe isn't very well."
Sometimes he doesn't realize what he's saying.
"But it's all right, Joe."
You can talk with mother and dads.
They're wonderful.
"You've probably never had anyone like them, because you wouldn't have had all the trouble you've had."
"Every now and then, Joe thinks he has a son like me."
He even calls me Joey.
It was funny.
"I wasn't afraid of him,"
But...
He's a good scout.
He's ok.
Good night.
"Can I get you something to eat, Joe?"
Thank you for bringing him back.
"With all my heart, I thank you."
"You are proud of him, aren't you?"
"He is the kind of a boy you really hoped for, isn't he?"
"Isn't he, Joe?"
I don't know.
I wouldn't say that.
"He ain't the kind of kid I'd put my money on, exactly."
"You got him conned into one way of thinking, so what the heck?"
"Let him stay that way, for all I give a darn."
"He didn't swallow what I told him, anyway."
"Ted, look at this."
I can pull all these video stills up.
"Come on, we have enough here to build a case."
Do you want to tell me what's going on?
What happened that night?
"Okay, I needed him."
I needed someone and he wouldn't even talk to me.
"I understand, all right?"
You felt abandoned.
No one was there for you.
"No one was there to listen, not even Aldo."
Like I didn't even exist.
"Look, just tell me... what happened that night, okay?"
"I can help you, no matter what you did."
(sniffs)
I didn't kill Aldo.
I did something worse.
What's worse than killing?
I went looking for him in Bellevue.
He started to go there to buy his drugs.
I didn't know what I was gonna do.
"Then, as I'm watching him, someone pulls up."
The driver gets out and jumps Aldo.
Who was it?
I don't know.
"Come on, Ted, look at me."
You have to remember who this was.
It could save you.
"Whatever happens, I deserve."
Because I froze.
I didn't help him.
"Aldo got taken and I just let it happen, like-like I wasn't even there."
Give him a piece of this.
Hmmm...
Hurry!
Dad!
Can I come in?
"Don't be mad at me, Dad!"
"Aw, you know I don't hold a grudge!"
I'm coming to open it.
Have a taste!
Can't we go a bit faster?
I'm sorry but this isn't an airplane.
"We're going all right, by the way."
"A department store on the left, a photoshop and a drugstore on the right."
Heading towards the square.
"A roundabout on the square, in a clockwise direction."
Compulsory yield of way.
"Hotel Lion to the right, the city museum in the front."
"You're trudging so slowly, as if you weren't aware of the fire!"
"Meanwhile, the house is burning down!"
Faster!
That way!
Everything fits.
"A dairy to the left, a watchmaker to the right."
Everything's reversed here!
Are you sure we didn't come in through the other gate?
What's this?
What the hell are you looking for here?
Can't you see it's a one-way street?
Don't you know where the fire is?
It's the Bernaus' house.
"No. 15, Lake Street."
Move back!
"Guys, I'm giving you the password of geometry."
"Pi, meaning 3.14."
I got it.
Try it first. 3-1-4.
Or 4-3-1.
Try them all.
This is it!
I couldn't delay her any longer.
She dropped off the grandson too.
We are almost at the street of the school.
What did you do?
We'll be done in 2 minutes.
We found the questions.
"Come on, get out of there."
What are you still doing?
Questions for physics and history.
This is heaven!
Get out!
You'll get caught.
Forget about history and physics.
What happened?
CSI Urfa operation has been completed.
Let's hope for the best.
This is it!
This is what I call killing three birds with one stone.
"Oh, come on."
That can't be.
They wouldn't dare do such a thing.
Don't you think I will be able to understand from their answers?
This is the first time in my life I've passed a math exam so easily.
"As I said yesterday, you all solved it in a different way, right?"
"If we all get a full mark, we will mess the whole thing up."
Was she just about to tell me she loved me?
I'm so glad we came.
Blair£¬I need to talk to you.
Gossip girl knows.
Ominous.But ill-timed.
You can tell me tomorrow or never.
About new year's?
"Look,the mean girls want the best piece of gossip"
In exchange for keys to the kingdom.
I just thought you'd want to know.
If gossip girl were gonna post that information
She would have done it this morning.
"and like I said,the mean girls don't control anything."
"Blair, wake up."
You're not queen anymore.
You haven't been for a while.
And you're not going to be either
If you tell anyone what you know.
I'm sorry I wasted my time on you.
You don't have what it takes.
You never did.
Now if you'll excuse me.
Bring me your leader.
It's not midnight.
My gossip's too juicy to wait.
I wanna talk.
I prefer to talk after.
What do you think about my coat?
I like it.
Why?
- And now?
- Even better.
"I had to, to make him quiet."
"""And then I didn't know what to do."
He was too heavy.
It was too far to the river.
So I left him.
Things kept going bad when I got back to our street.
His mum was already looking for him.
Thom!
Thom?
"""So I went behind mrs Bailey's house, where dad found that weird guy."
"That's where I had to leave the jacket."""
Christy.
Christy?
Ben!
Where's the phone?
I thought dad would still be asleep.
Must have been right behind me.
"""Things kept going wrong."
I went back for the jacket it was gone.
"And then I found out you were looking for a torch, so I thought if I put dad's torch back, you'd leave him alone."
"On Christmas day, I heard dad get up early."
I followed him up to mrs Bailey's house and I found the jacket there.
""" That weird man must have taken it."
"""All I had to do was put it back in her house."
""" Now ""her"", meaning ms murnane?"
But mum mum made it hard.
"""I just wanted us to have a normal Christmas."""
But it wasn't.
"""I came back with Tash, but then she came over."""
"We'd only been gone a day, and she was already after dad."
Thom was gone.
We'd gone.
Then I won't go to Stanford until next year.
But you've been thinking about this for like forever.
Yeah and didn't you just order the official Stanford coffee mug.
Mouse pad combo pack?
"Don't you have an omelet to make, mister?"
[Sighs] No wonder Oliver's always on tour.
Boy's not as dumb as I thought he was.
[Sighs]
"Look, you're right, I mean, I have always wanted to go there."
But I've always wanted to go there with you.
And you know I can do that next year.
But it's such a sacrifice.
"Yeah, but look what you've done for me."
"I mean, you've taken me into your house."
"-Uh, whose house?"
-Omelet!
Yes ma'am.
And you let me be Lola.
I get to ride around in limos and private jets.
And live the rock star life.
"I mean, I can never repay you for all of that."
-True.
-That didn't require a response.
Sorry.
Go on.
Look the point is I just want to do this for you.
So please let me.
-You really are the best friend ever.
-I know.
"Aw, if grown men could only hug like teenage girls."
There'd be no more wars.
"When I ask, do you wanna dance?"
"I was afraid if i went without a lawyer,"
I would say something stupid and make it worse.
And you guys are the only lawyers that i've ever heard of.
How?
How did you hear of us?
From all the big cases that you do.
"Mr. Trott,i don't deserve to go to jail."
I need you to take my case.
We don't take walk-Ins.
"Come on,ron."
"A great case like this walks in,"
You just don't let it walk out and go to geragos.
Look at the tv.
"Mrs. Stein,the dead man's wife, is in paris."
"She's flying home this evening, grief-Stricken."
"This is the lead story,ron."
It's only going to get bigger.
"Plus,i've already talked to ann,and i've heard her story."
"I believe her,ron."
"She had to kill him,"
Or he would have killed her.
And i've also done a background check.
She has no criminal record.
We can win this thing on self-Defense.
We'll take your case.
We will?
Tom and luther are right.
"This is going to be a media circus,"
The kind of case we're built to win.
We're tntg.
We don't lose.
I don't have any money.
Please leave a message.
"Hi, baby."
"It's me, Stan."
"I was just sitting here on my bed eating dinner by myself, and I'm looking at the place where we, you know, were last night, and..."
Holy cow!
It's still warm!
"Oh, wait."
That's because I put my spaghetti pot on it.
I make a good sauce.
"I take a jar of Paul Newman's, and I add..."
"Wait, what happened?"
I slept with him.
"No, with the sauce."
What did he add?
I picked the worst person to have a one-night stand with.
He's a parent at Ritchie's school!
"He's depressed, he's needy."
"Well, it sounds like you two have a lot in common."
"What was I thinking going to the supermarket, picking up a random guy for sex?"
Huh.
"Out loud, it sounds foolproof."
"Oh, this is awful."
Sad Dad isn't going away.
"""Sad Dad""?"
Isn't that sweet.
You guys already have pet names for each other.
"Shut up, Matthew-- you've got to help me."
"Just pick up the phone and tell him the truth-- he was a one-night stand, and you never want to see him again."
No.
I'm gonna handle this my way.
I'll cut my bangs and eat a Dove bar and go to bed.
"Hey, did you hear that?"
"Yeah,"
I have a date with you.
Half with olives.
We aim to please.
"Well, you hit the bulls eye Tara."
What?
You know how I like to kid around.
"Yeah, you're famous for it."
"Dad, you really think that's gonna help what's going on?"
"Look, you know I think this counseling crap is ridiculous but I promised your mom I'd try again."
We'll be okay.
Right.
You just focus on your game.
Whitey kick your ass today?
I didn't go to practice.
"What's going on with you, Nate?"
"Nothing, I just need some time."
Okay?
No its not okay.
It's career suicide.
"- Dad, Keith said..."
- Keith said!
You talked to Keith?
You take advice from Keith you'll end up spending the rest of your life running a second rate auto garage.
Is that what you want?
I told you.
I don't know what I want.
That's just freaky.
Where do you get off telling Nathan he can quit the team?
I didn't tell him he could quit.
"He wanted to talk, we talked."
"Maybe you ought to try it, sometimes."
Let's just say we both did good.
Beifong says you're free to go.
"Sorry for ever doubting you, Mako."
"Don't worry about it, bro."
"Nice job, Mako."
You're going to make a great Detective.
"But, chief, there aren't any Detective openings right now."
"Actually, we have two openings."
Mwah.
"Mako, I missed you so much."
"Oh, yeah, did I forget to tell you?"
Korra's back.
"Korra, hey, I missed you too."
So you're not still mad at me?
Why would I be mad?
"We had that fight before you left, remember?"
"No, not really."
"I got attacked by a dark spirit, and I lost my memory for a little while."
Maybe it hasn't all come back yet.
Was it a bad fight?
Uh...
Mm...
No.
"No, it..."
it wasn't that bad.
"Korra, we don't have much time."
We need to figure out how to deal with Unalaq.
I think I know just the man to talk to.
"Guys, hey!"
What do you think?
"Varrick industries built this prison, and I had this cell made special."
I had a feeling I'd end up here one day.
How careless of me.
I left my cigarettes at home.
Then you won't need the matches.
"I'm afraid that won't work, unless you have a needle and thread."
"Excuse me, have you change for a quarter?"
Thank you very much.
You shouldn't have done that just for me.
I could've gotten along without them.
- You hold it.
- All right.
Looks like a jackpot.
"Go and get your lucky quarter back, quick."
I beg your pardon.
You probably think I'm silly.
"Yes, I'm afraid I do."
Just a moment.
"That quarter, I wonder if I could have it back?"
This isn't getting you anywhere.
You don't understand.
I'm not trying to get acquainted.
All I want to know is...
"It's all my fault, too."
I'm awfully sorry.
"Yes, I know."
You've been trying so hard to avoid me.
"All right, give it back."
- Give what back?
- The quarter you stole from my purse.
"Come on, will you?"
Hand it over or I'll call a policeman.
I haven't got it.
I gave it to you at the cigarette machine.
You are so good.
Wow.
Thank you.
We really don't even have any notes.
I think you just became my favorite network.
Just a few tone questions.
O-kay.
We're a little concerned that the characters all seem a bit too... angry.
Oh...
"Well, it... it's called ""angry men,"" so..."
"No, I know, and we love it."
Mm.
Shouldn't we maybe wait till the new guy starts and see what he thinks?
I think we want to make sure he's seeing the best possible version of this.
Maybe this is the best possible version.
It's not.
I'm gonna kill somebody.
Phew.
Thought that was just happening in my head.
Excuse me a moment.
"Okay, stop!"
Stop!
"I know you have jobs to do, but so do we, and it's just..."
it's... it's impossible!
Seriously!
Enough!
How many fucking bookshelves does this guy need?
!
It's true.
I heard he can't even read.
No one told us you were coming in today.
I'd have prepared a more embarrassing way to meet you.
Oh!
He just... he just kicked me!
"Annie, tell him off."
"Oh, that's Mitchell."
- I'd better warn him about this.
Can...
"- Yeah, yeah."
Just put the Hoover round and maybe just dust a little.
Thanks.
Mitchell?
Is that another ghost?
"It's bloody Hogwarts, this place."
"No, Mitchell is a vampire, actually."
Vamp...
"At last, someone normal."
I'd better go and...
Are you gonna do both beds?
- Do both beds.
Do...
- OK.
"Just in case, you know, in the night, me and you just want to... in the night, just sort of do that."
- You've got to be joking.
- It won't be for long.
"It's just until his dad recovers, and then he'll be out of here."
I will make sure of it.
"We just thought, with you having gone through it..."
Me going through it is exactly why I can't have him in the house.
The kid's still feeding.
Staying clean from meat is a day-by-day...
"No, no, a minute-by-minute thing."
"How am I gonna manage if he's giving it, ""Oh, let's go out on the razz,"
"""find some women, drink them dry""?"
What does that mean?
"Okay, we need to get you to a doctor right now and get that thing checked out."
I'm not going to a doctor for a cat scratch.
"Listen, your life could be in danger."
That's ridiculous.
- Juliette.
- I'm tired of this.
You don't understand what she is.
What?
"What is she, Nick?"
"She's an attractive, successful woman."
You saved her life once.
I don't know what it is you have against her now.
What is it that you're not telling me?
Do you have some kind of relationship with her?
- No.
- Then what is it?
"She's a witch, okay?"
"You're going to need to try a little harder, Nick."
What?
Does she ride a broom?
Because I distinctly remember her getting into a BMW.
"You don't know what's going on here, Juliette."
Then isn't it about time you tell me?
You're going to the doctor.
"I told you, I'm not going to a doctor till you tell me why you're acting so crazy."
[Sighs]
Okay.
You want the truth?
"Yeah, the truth would be nice."
Get your coat.
"I told you, I'm not going to a doctor."
- I'm not sleeping here?
- No.
You need a pee?
Go on.
I can't do it for you.
Then we'll go.
"Mum, I must tell you."
It's all gone wrong.
- What's the matter?
- Guillaume has a lover.
I'm almost sure of it.
Sure?
Do you have proof?
Loads of proof.
"Absences, lateness, poor excuses..."
He's always texting.
"If guys could lie, it would be easier."
"I tell you, he's seeing someone."
"I don't have to tell you, you know all that."
So I'm really pissed off.
"But don't worry, I'll survive."
- Did you tell your father?
- What?
He'd probably defend him.
We have about 7.2 billion people today.
That's going to go to nine and a half by 2050.
That means that we have 35 years to basically double the food supply.
We will need to produce more food than has been produced
In the entire history of the world.
That's probably the greatest challenge facing mankind.
"And I'll tell ya, I think we can do it."
Yeung:
"Evelyn, do you want a Nescaf?"
Do you want a Nescaf?
This came for you yesterday.
I forgot.
Here you are.
Trot down to the mail room with that.
"Take the stairs, get a bit of that weight off."
"I'm back at four, Enid."
"I'll take it down, Pauline."
Sorry.
"Why are you apologising for him, Enid?"
He doesn't bother me.
I don't have to see him in my lunch hour.
Or with his clothes off.
Who else knows?
No-one.
You come back on a Tuesday afternoon with flat hair and different tights on.
I just button my lip and keep typing.
Do you think the worse of me?
"No, I don't think the worse of you for sleeping with him."
We've all got a few regrettable bedspreads in our past.
But to pass up the chance of a nice bloke who's itching to treat you properly - that is barmy.
It's complicated.
"Is it heck as like, Enid!"
"I've just seen him now, Tubby, on my way back."
He's just gone into Duncan and Fosters.
"God, Enid!"
"Go and find him, tell him you've been a bloody idiot and you want to go out with him."
Shall I?
Yes!
Go on.
Hurry up.
- Reinhold.
"Bye, Reinhold."
"You used to be my girlfriend, Cilly."
"Nah, not anymore."
"Maybe we'll get back together, Cilly."
"Well, you'll keep an eye on the fat one."
We can use him.
He already spent time in Tegel
I don't like our two new guys.
Weaklings.
We'll take that one.
Looks pretty solid.
Right.
He seems a little dumb too.
Does he want to do it?
None of your business.
"Karl, go follow him."
"Hey, stop pushing!"
"Wait, I'm just looking for someone."
Did you see someone with a furry brown coat?
I didn't see no-one.
Furry brown coat?
Where are you from?
Who sent you here?
"Well, since you didn't see such a guy this really shouldn't bother you."
Lot of people with furry brown coats show up here.
"See, he knows!"
But then one has to know who sent you.
That still doesn't mean that I have to tell you about my business here.
When you ask someone if they saw someone with a furry brown coat... then he has the right to ask you who sent you.
I don't need to tell you who I am nonetheless.
No no buddy.
- What's that?
- For you to sign up.
"When we get Cutter, we'll tear up the papers."
It'll be according to regulations.
Is that fair enough for you?
You're getting clever again.
Do you want me to get kicked out of the army?
"All right, I'll sign, but on one condition."
That I hold the blank in my hand and I keep it after I'm through.
You don't trust me.
That's right.
All right.
What are you doing with that in your pocket?
I always carry one.
In case.
"No, you don't."
"Not a word of this to Emmy, you understand?"
Shake on it?
Hurry up.
"Excuse me, miss."
Sgt. Ballantine and I are going out on a reconnoitering expedition.
"- Yes, sir."
"- Lf we're not back by morning... inform the Colonel, and you follow our trail."
- Come this way.
"- Excuse me, Miss Stebbins."
"- I'm going, Emmy."
He's changed his mind.
- Who made him change it?
- Reason and common decency.
- You're lying.
"Would I lie at a time like this, just before our wedding?"
Be reasonable.
Get him off!
Get him off!
"Come back here, you!"
I regret nothing!
I'm too young to have termites!
"I'm no termite, Pinocchio."
I'm a cricket.
You were the voice in my head this whole time?
That's right.
I'm the one who was putting all those thoughts in your noggin.
"I'm your conscience, and as long as you let me,"
I'll always be your...
The end.
That wasn't me.
I never had any bugs in my head.
Ask anyone.
"OK, then."
Why don't we start by asking your conscience.
Now who's cheating?
"Well, Donkey, looks like it's just you and me."
Go ahead.
There ain't nothing you can say that can scare me.
"Oh, well, I suppose there's nothing left to do but sit here in the dark and wait for the ghost."
Ghost?
What ghost?
"Farquaad's ghost, of course."
"As a matter of fact, if I remember correctly,"
I believe you had a hand in his untimely demise.
"Hey, man."
That was an accident.
"And besides, all that ghost stuff is just an urban legend."
- You know that.
I used to... act out.
Patrick was popular.
He'd ditch his girlfriend after games and we'd go down to the pier.
"Well, under it."
Did you and Patrick reunite for old times' sake ?
No.
"Michelle, Patrick incurred a suction bruise on his neck antemortem."
What's that mean ?
It means whoever gave him the hickey did so before his murder.
Perhaps during it.
Now we swabbed the area around his neck to check for DNA.
Would you care to give us a sample for comparison ?
Patrick was so cute.
I just wanted to experience that feeling again.
- Okay...
Okay !
- Come on.
Still like that ?
"Oh, you know it."
"But to him, I was still a skank."
Hear that ?
I requested our song.
We didn't have a song.
Come on.
Let's go out there and dance.
"What, in public ?"
Are you kidding me ?
I didn't take you out in public in high school.
Why would I start now ?
"If someone killed him, I can't say I'm sorry."
But it wasn't me.
Alexx...
Have you seen other things?
Other creatures?
There's more out there than even you and I know about.
I photograph and study what I can.
"So, Shannon, if you would do me the honour of being my guide, tonight, I will find the beast for you."
I'd be delighted.
"- Here, let me help."
- Thanks.
"So, you're with Kyle?"
Filming Kyle.
There's a difference.
- That the beast freak?
- We just call her Shannon.
Good.
It's always better if they look like they don't live under a bridge.
"- So, I'm Tom."
And you are?
- Busy.
Jo.
You are Jo.
"So, what are you, a film student?"
Yes.
I'll let you be in my documentary if you leave me alone for two minutes to set up.
"So, you're hunting the hunter, so to speak?"
"Right, I'll just let you get on."
"Excuse me, but if you're going to interview anyone about the beast, it has to be us."
We've known about it for years.
What are you looking for?
I don't know.
I can't stand still.
"OK, water's in bowls, wolf snacks are in place."
We're all set.
"All right, go ahead."
I gotta go.
Baby!
You guys go ahead!
We'll meet you guys there!
"So, what are we gonna do about Trudy?"
"What are we gonna do about Cynthia, who just disappeared into the jungle?"
"Jason, she's upset."
Let her cool down.
You'll talk to her later.
"We still gotta get Trudy to do all the Marcel stuff, anyway, all right?"
So let's just get her ass and let's get back home.
"Cyn, please, slow down, honey."
I think we're almost there.
I think we might have taken a wrong turn.
Really?
Yeah.
Wow.
Finally made it to the waterfall.
I think my marriage is over.
What?
"Honey, don't say that."
You're just exhausted.
I am.
I'm so tired of him trying to steer everything in the direction that he thinks is right all the time.
Listen.
Don't make any decisions right now.
You guys just need to take a breather.
"Get a little bit of space, you know?"
You'll be okay.
You know?
You guys have been on top of each other ever since we got here.
- I want you to meet my girlfriend.
She needs your help.
She's desperate to get out of the country as fast as possible.
And since you're an expert in that kind of thing --
You -- your girlfriend?
It's a new thing.
"Well, if she's your girlfriend, where did you meet?"
Both of you at the same time.
"One, two, three, go!"
A f-friend's house.
I-- the Internet.
"Uh, my friend's Internet house."
"I hope you get eye cancer, Dixon."
W-w-w-w-w-wait.
You don't understand.
"No, I-I understand well enough, okay?"
"And so spare me the sob story, spare me the desperate tale of woe."
"Well, I-I don't have a desperate tale of woe."
But I do have three very well-armed friends.
That would be us.
You might want to invite us in.
"Dixon, you slack-jawed, traitorous nimrod!"
I -- that's your spy friend!
"I-I tell you I'm going off the grid, and you bring the most radioactive man in Miami to my door?"
!
"Are you gonna invite us in, or do I have to start shooting?"
God.
Fine.
Yes.
Come in.
Quickly!
Don't saunter!
"Oh, my God, you're right!"
I'm free!
Yeah.
So if you think about it-- but not too much-- it's actually good that Carly and I hooked up.
"Yeah, it's really good."
"I mean, this guy goes at it like he's still in his 50s."
"Hey, have a cigar, you big crazy!"
"Hey, don't try to make this okay."
You still slept with my sister.
"Promise me you will never, ever do that again."
I promise.
You just winked.
"No, I didn't."
You did it again!
"No, I didn't!"
"You swear, right?"
Yeah.
Of course.
Hey.
"That night, even though she still couldn't get a beer,"
Robin realized the true power of the ring.
♪
"Hey, Robin."
Did you ever figure out how you're gonna get a drink at the bar now that you're engaged?
"Oh, sure."
I know a way that's gonna last forever.
Scotch on the rocks?
Coming right up.
"Now, before you say anything about the hat... this new girl's ass is phenomenal!"
"Hey, Marshall, you got to see this."
The catalog must have mixed up my order.
You won't believe the jeans they just sent me.
"He wants power, that's different."
But you both qualify:
"same rank, seniority, service rating."
"So whoever nails that scum, will be king."
I don't mix with brass.
It's better than mixing with whores and hoods.
Times have changed.
Get yourself a new style.
You're an anomaly.
"Your men, your methods."
"In the police, now you toe the line, you snap to."
"If you don't, no one will cover for you."
All the brass have caved in.
Even you?
"Lay off me, shit!"
Who the fuck are you?
"Shit, what ya doin'?"
Who the fuck are you?
What have I done?
"Don't do that, don't!"
"Lay off Manou, or I'll stuff you with your brother's head."
Quite a shiv!
War booty.
"Creep's gotta hitchhike buck-naked, and cuffed!"
We shoulda wasted him!
Gotta be ten grand!
A year's pay for a flatfoot.
Those fuckers!
For our slush fund?
"No, it's for Manou."
Leo.
Come in.
Why would I drive his car?
Manoj said that you were fired because of you didn't maintain the car properly.
I was his driver for 3 years.
"If that was true, he could've fired me long ago."
My current employer verified with him before giving me this job.
You can cross-check if needed.
"If it wasn't you, who would've driven the car?"
I thought that he was going to sell the car.
He didn't say anything when I asked him.
"One day, I saw a lady driving his car."
I heard that she was staying with him.
I presumed that that might be the reason for firing me.
Do you know her?
No.
I have not seen her while I was working for him.
How did she look like?
"She was young, fair, and stylish."
Age?
She was a young lady.
Would you able to identify her?
I can't be very sure.
We will enquire again if required.
Give me your number.
You mustn't leave the town now.
"Okay, Sir."
"Yes, aunt."
How are you?
I'm okay.
Tell me.
What's the matter?
Did Varun call you?
I have deleted his number.
There's something I want to ask you about.
"Sure, yeah."
So this girl...
- Saffron.
- Such a pretty name.
And you like her?
So what problem?
"I had a fiancée... not so long ago, and it did not end well for me."
The heart is strong muscle.
It spring back.
You ready for the love again.
"Yeah, but I don't know if this is the kind of woman that..."
"Come, Mr. Heller, you handsome man."
Don't.
I know how people see me.
But this Saffron make you feel good.
Yeah.
She makes me want to... be nice.
I think you have good luck with this girl.
"If there's any way we could see the room before paying for it... um, we just want to make sure the room is up to our standards."
We don't usually let people see the rooms before they check in.
"I guess they just don't want us here, babe."
"You want to carry me over the threshold, too?"
"Yeah, you wish."
Let's hurry this up.
Are you coming out anytime this year?
"Crap, I think we're out of hot water."
"Hey, man, you want to use this?"
Eat shit!
"Hello, Alice."
"Hello, Ava."
We decided against it.
"Whatever, corn chip man."
You got a problem with that?
"No, but..."
It's kind of low rent in the era of the cronut.
"""Cronuts""?"
What's a cronut?
Imagine a croissant had a baby with a doughnut.
"- Oh, that sounds like a delicious baby."
- Mm-hmm.
"Well, let's go right now."
"The only bakery that makes them is, uh, a few blocks away."
Fresh cronuts...
Full day's calories in one bite.
I can't.
I-I'm swamped.
I can't leave.
You always say that.
"You know, the only time I see you is when I come here."
"Well, I-I practically live here."
You're gonna have to deal with that.
At some point... soon...
"You're gonna have to let me take you on a proper date so we can, you know, move this thing forward."
Thing?
What thing?
"Hey, hey!"
Nice!
"Dad, you look tired."
Would you like to lie down?
"Well, I am tired a little bit after chemo, but I'm stronger than I have been."
Being with you and Jackson is the best medicine I've got.
This new treatment sounds so hopeful.
It is.
The day after tomorrow. you know what you gotta do out there. we've decided to get a little bit of insurance.
Don't fuck it up.
All bets are closed.
All are closed.
are you ready?
Are you ready?
On my mark.
Fight!

That kid just chose his ego over your life.
Can you believe that?
I just can't figure out why... this fuck hole would choose to get his goddamn neck slit to keep a fucking win streak!
Can you tell me?
Can you tell me?
Can you fucking tell me?
Can anybody fucking tell me?
Give it to Jimmy.
Pay 'em their fucking winnings.
I had this little black dog when I was a kid.
We tried like hell but it was so stupid.
Maybe it was retarded.
They got retarded dogs?
I don't know.
Would've been better to let him die.
His brother's gone crazy.
We need to call the police.
"Got no oxygen going to his brain, see... 'cause of the rope."
Half of it died away.
Now it don't hardly work no more.
"Better off dead, I reckon."
I need to call the police.
"Master Justin said he didn't need no help, cocking bugger."
Step away from the bed.
"You look after him, right?"
That's your job.
To keep him alive.
"So, if you just put the gun on the bed, and leave the room, you'll just be doing your job, right?"
Please... just go.
"I need a phone, Felix."
Good boy.
Shit.
Justin can help me.
- He says his family will protect me.
- And you believe him?
He's an army man.
Loyalty means a lot to him.
"Excuse me, Luke, in case you hadn't noticed, he's demented!"
He's obsessed with a fucking postcard!
"And you're on the list, remember?"
You are one of the scratched-out faces.
"When he's finished us off, Luke, you're going to be the only one left."
You sent it.
You sent the fucking postcard.
- Shut up.
"- Luke, for fuck's sake!"
"Oh, I remember these."
Can we go again?
Sure.
I'm happy to take more of your money.
Gambling's awesome.
I think it's gonna be a problem for me later in life.
Whoo!
I feel good.
"- Me, too."
- Yeah.
"Mom, all you do is try to get attention, and all I do is yell at you."
We have got to figure out a way to stop that.
- Mm.
"- I mean, come on, Mom."
What is with this thing?
"Well, it's... it's from my car accident."
"I called you about it, but you never followed up."
Because you said it was nothing.
"When I hear the word ""nothing,"" I move on."
"Okay, can I just ask you..."
Why is it so hard for you to be there for me?
Seriously?
When were you there for me?
You picked a life of travel and adventure over being there for your kids!
"I sound happy, but I'm very upset!"
"Katie, I know that I wasn't a good parent."
"You know, whatever that thing was that's supposed to kick in just never kicked in."
"Well, maybe because you were such a crappy mom, that's why I try so hard to be a good mom."
Oh!
So I made you a good mom.
Mnh-mnh.
That's not what I'm saying.
Is there anyone remembers where we left off last time?
Actually I need to go to the bathroom.
Quiet!
"First, come to the board, then you can go."
Take a piece of chalk from there.
I took the chalk.
Draw a trapezoid for me.
"No way, Professor, I don't trap people."
I don't do things like that.
"I said draw a shape, a trapezoid."
Did I ask for something else?
"Sit down, zero!"
"You, you are a dead man!"
"Hey you, the one with the hood."
Stop there.
Come here.
Come here.
Take your hood off.
"Take if off, take it off."
How wonderful!
Very nice!
It's high time you have a makeover.
"Yeah, it's high time."
From now until the day you cut your hair...
I will be taking away some of it in small bunches like this.
Ok?
"Now, have a great lesson."
May God help you through the lessons.
"Again, a question from 2005 goes like this..."
The engine of my car doesn't start.
"So, I take it to a mechanic to see what... is wrong with it, and he says nothing."
"If p is, qpurely and simply..."
Shouldn't it be Brandon's decision?
He's the one who got his ass kicked.
"I wouldn't put it that way, but that's a good point."
What if it doesn't work?
"I mean, what if he can't use his fingers at all?"
"Look, Mike and I talked through all of this."
And you made your decision.
Got it.
Hey.
Nice coat rack.
"Yeah, well, might as well use it for something."
Brandon.
"I mean, you can still play, right?"
Not classical.
Not the way I did.
"OK, so all music is dead to you then?"
"- No, but..."
"- Well, it sounds like that's what you're risking,"
- if you have this surgery.
- Ok.
"Look, I had a future."
That's not something you just throw away.
But what if you're not throwing it away?
What if it's just... a different future?
"What if it doesn't have to be that way, though?"
"I mean, why is everyone focusing on the worst-case scenario?"
"Ok, yeah, I'm sorry."
I hear you.
It's...
I hate it when people assume the worst.
- Like your birth dad?
"- Yeah, like him."
- You're not Mr. Sommer.
"- No, I'm not."
No harm done.
What's up... with y'all?
[Turk] Ahh!
"Hey, Dr. Turk."
What happened to you?
I found the latest issue at a comic book store a mile and a half away.
Here you go.
"Actually, I ran there in a foam needle suit, but you don't care."
"Thanks, Dr. Turk."
"Christopher, I heard you were sweating the rankings."
No.
I'm married and trying to have a baby.
Not having a job would be a big boost for me.
You're a good surgeon.
"Plus, your bedside manner is really important."
There's no one on that list who spends more time with their patients.
Are you saying I have a job?
"If you are trying to ""Kelly Ripa"" me right now, I will freak out."
I got a job!
"Well, the good news is, his head isn't in the storage room."
I once found a head.
It's a funny story.
I put it in my locker.
"I didn't have time to get to Lost and Found, forgot all about it."
"Come back to work on Monday, open my locker, whoa!"
Head!
Plus rats!
I panicked.
I didn't know what to do.
"I grabbed the thing and ran up to the roof, punt it, and I shank it wide-left."
- Shit!
- I didn't send the postcard!
If Chris says he didnt send the postcard then he didn't send the fucking postcard
End of discussion.
All of us are in deep shit here.
All of us.
"Now let's focus on getting out of here, okay?"
Now keep twisting at your tape.
Gaffer's strong but it stretches.
One of us might be able to work a hand free.
So tell me about the party.
- Whatcha wanna know?
- Did you see Felix there?
"Yeah, I-I saw him."
Did you talk to him?
Did he seem all right to you?
"He was good, you know?"
He was fine.
Chris mentioned something with Gemma.
"Uh, Felix fancied her."
"I told him to go for it, you know."
"I said, end of the term, anything goes."
- You think she was out of his league.
- No way!
"He just needed to be confident, 'cause that's what the girls like."
Just a bit of confidence.
So you sold him drugs?
"It was just a couple of lines, I swear, I was just trying to help."
That was en error of judgement.
"I'm just a ""party guy."""
"Gemma, there's a workbench just a few feet behind you."
There's a drawer.
I just want to be with you.
"I know, I just..."
I think it's healthier to spend time with friends.
How is that healthier?
"Because if you start acting stupid or something or you're not nice to me,"
Amy will point it out if I don't notice.
Girls need girlfriends for that.
I'm not going to be not nice to you.
Why would I be not nice to you?
I'm in love with you.
It was just an example.
I want a friend.
I want us to have friends.
I liked it better when you were friends with Adrian.
That is over.
Let's go.
All right.
"Not ""all right."""
I want you to be enthusiastic about whatever I want to do.
Even when it's something stupid like going to a married couple's apartment and babysitting as our first date back together?
That doesn't sound very enthusiastic.
I can't wait!
(GASPS) There we go.
(SIGHS)
"Oh, Leo, I'm sorry I'm late."
Crazy day at work.
"Relax, glad you could make it, good to see you."
How was your day?
"Oh, it was good."
Yeah?
Any word from the school board?
"Oh, I heard from them, all right."
"Cancel your plans for tonight, we're going to keep watch on the whores and catch Niko."
"- Laure, can I talk to you?"
- I don't have time.
Wait!
Stop being angry at me.
"- I'm an honest guy, you know me."
- Really?
You call going behind my back honest?
I didn't go behind your back.
I had an agreement with Bremont so he wouldn't shut down your career and Aubert's.
"He's the one who's after you, Laure, not me."
What?
"- Oh, yes."
"I don't know what you did to him, but he doesn't like you very much."
"Get them now, we're going to start."
Excuse me.
Could you tell Jérôme I'd like to see him?
- I'll be in the changing room.
"- OK, I'll tell him."
What are you doing here?
I came to see the youth worker.
- You've got my money?
- Let me go.
Wait.
"I want my share, you fucker."
Son of a bitch.
You're not entitled to anything.
You chickened out.
"Without me you wouldn't have had the key to the office,"
"- so I want my money, or I'll kill you."
- Get lost!
"Don't show up here unless you have the money, got it?"
"I'm sorry, OK?"
It's something with my family.
I can't talk about it now.
"Look, I got to go."
I'll call you tomorrow.
- Hey.
"- Glad you called, man."
- It's been a while.
- Thanks for coming.
It's bad enough my dad was in love with another woman.
Like my mom wasn't enough.
- But another kid?
- I guess you weren't enough?
I almost died and yet there I am back in the same place.
- Ready to do it all again.
- But you didn't.
You didn't use.
"And that's good, man."
"- Yeah, but I came close, bro."
- Of course you did.
This whole thing is textbook you.
"Look, I know you, Justin."
You didn't become a medic for nothing.
You can't stand to see people in pain.
And right now you and your family are suffering.
There's nothing you can do to make that go away.
"If it gets overwhelming, you know the drill."
"Find a meeting, work the steps."
I don't get it.
"How could he lie to us about his own daughter, knowing what it would do to us when we found out?"
And her.
"Rebecca, right?"
Of course not.
"You're being funny, aren't you?"
Mum and Roger had a big row  then had gone off to the kitchen to talk quietly.
Then Roger came out.
Then why did you split up with Roger?
Did he have another girlfriend?
I don't think so.
Do you have another boyfriend?
Don't you think you would know?
"Who would I be seeing, the milkman?"
No.
He's too young.
"No, Marcus."
I haven't got another boyfriend.
That's not how it works.
"Not when you're a 34-year-old working mother in a youth-obsessed, anorexic, soulless culture."
"Don't worry, Mum."
I won't go to McDonald's.
I hope she makes you itch.
"You know, really itch."
- I just can't believe how you could do that.
- You bloody pig!
What were you thinking?
Do you have shit for brains?
Let it out.
Let it out.
You're a bastard!
I hate you for what you've done.
That's good.
"I wouldn't mind if you did it once, but you wanted to do it twice."
- I wanna put my hands around your throat...
- You don't have to do that.
"Oh, my gosh."
Do you remember The Casbah?
That concert?
- Barely.
In the best way.
"- Oh, my God."
"You covered ""How Will I Know?"" And you dedicated it to me and I sat there trying not to laugh."
I was so in love with you.
What are we doing?
Things were easier when we were younger.
"Unlike our kids, we just jumped into things."
"I mean, why can't we just be more like that?"
Just figure it out as we go along.
Maybe this didn't turn out to be the romance we thought it would be.
It was more like choose your own adventure.
Maybe it just wasn't the right time.
Maybe it never will be.
What if it is?
What if we're just too stubborn to see it.
- I don't wanna miss out.
"- Well, neither do I."
I don't have a ring so this will have to do.
"- Rufus, what are you doing?"
"Marry me, Lily."
Marry me.
I know that'll make me your fifth husband.
So...
Yes.
Give me your hand.
Come here.
"Hey, don't worry about this, okay?"
Everyone's gonna get over it eventually.
"Oh, please do."
Go ahead.
I shouldn't keep you longer.
Students who are willing to go to class!
"This way, Mr. Kaan."
You'd better cut your hair.
I don't want to see it like this again.
Who could give us the multiples of this?
"Yeah, take your time."
Take the chalk.
But I didn't raise my hand Professor.
- Excuse me?
- I didn't raise my hand.
You'd better answer this question before I divide you up by your multiples.
"Come on kid, come on."
Sit down!
Hey listen;
I have the voice of a dramatic soprano.
I am now an alto and do you know why?
Because I've lost my voice while making a demo.
But my album is being delayed.
How could this be?
Alright!
"Move it, move it."
I beg you.
"Dude, don't these teachers ever change?"
Do they always choose the ones who don't raise their hands?
That's their tactic.
"In Professor Fatma's class if you raise your hand, you're safe."
Really?
We'll see about that.
We're now doing geometry.
You left it blank.
Korean?
Korean?
I am not familiar with Korean.
Dealer's choice.
Whatever releases the most tension.
Mmm.
"Oh, that feels so good."
Thank you.
I can't tell you how much I need this.
It has been a long time.
"Oh, I love pleasuring people."
So do I.
"I mean, it's not my job, but it is a job that I love doing, if you know what I mean."
I know exactly what you mean.
"So, Joey, do you have any problem areas?"
I hold a lot of tension in my upper thighs.
We'll get to your upper thighs.
It's just the top of my quads.
"As a matter of fact, if you want to do, like, the full 80 minutes on the thighs, I'm good."
Whatever you want.
"Oh, I need this."
You have no idea.
"Oh, you got great hands."
"Okay, Joey, what I want you to do for me is just close your eyes."
"Quiet that mind, okay?"
Just listen to my voice.
Feel the sound slide down my throat and come out through my mouth.
"Down my throat, come out through my mouth."
Down my throat...
Keep...
"Keep going, keep going."
- Would you like to see them?
"- Oh, we will."
Indeed.
Don't spare the horses.
Take the next slipway.
"Off, here."
Here we go.
"Hang on, laddie."
Let's turn the tables on these buggers.
Tally ho.
Big Ben.
Akan is a cunt!
"Oh, my."
Looks like Akan's already begun.
"By tomorrow, these poor chaps will be super robotic soldiers like yourself."
Look out!
"On your feet, lad."
On your left.
Hang on.
I'm gonna buy you some time!
Seal the door.
Can't tell you the number of times I've dreamt that I was riding up in this lift.
It's a pity I can't...
"It's just the landing gear, laddie."
"Now, listen to me."
"When you kill Akan, I want you to look him right in those eyes until the rest of him is just as dead as they are, understood?"
"No, I'm afraid I shall not be coming with."
But you letting me get you this far has given an old sweat his grandest gift in all his years.
No.
It's lodged in his jugular.
"If you uncork it, I won't be able to..."
"The thingamajig in your pocket, quickly."
Love is a thief and stealing your heart tonight.
"And you give it to me, giving me all of you."
Your all I see...
You're all I want it to be.
I love you.
"Wow, he is good."
"I know, right?"
He looks so different.
I don't think he's as clean as he used to be.
Clean?
He's got that whole grungy working for him.
You can say that again.
Hey Jill where's Drew tonight?
Oh he had a movie screening and then he's going out with the guys
Is he excited about the whole engagement?
Yes he's so excited.
"And I decided that I don't want a long engagement so we set a date, September."
Ohhhhhh
That's great.
Don't you think that's a little quick?
Ah no Hallie I don't.
I'm pushing 30 Ok.
You just tell me how it feels when you get here.
I'm 25 Jill it's not like you're 108.
Count me out on this one.
My agent told me never to divulge my real age.
So I can't partake in the conversation either.
And you both smell like desperate whores
Thank you all for coming thank you very much.
Hey.
You made it huh?
That was incredible.
So this is a test run to see if i can handle things
And not slip back into my old habits again.
"Well, speaking of handling things,"
I don't know how your mother's gonna handle
Seeing you after the way you two parted.
"Oh, she's been going through a very rough time lately."
But seeing you like this is gonna make her happy.
- I know it is.
"- I don't know, grandma."
We haven't spoken in months
And you know she wasn't really that happy with me
The last time we saw each other.
"Well, like you said, that was months ago."
We'll just have to see how she handles things today.
"Oh, she..."
Seeing you is gonna make her happy.
I just know it.
"mom, let me in."
I left my keys.
"Oh, y'all go and hide in the hall closet."
I'll see how she's feeling before you come in.
"mom, let me in."
- Where's your key?
- I don't know.
I forgot 'em.
- Oh.
"- Hey, mom,"
"So, ma, is that marcus's car out there?"
"Well, there's a lot of cars that look like marcus's car."
So that's...
I-I...
I thought...
Do you see how low that is?
I used to be able to touch my knee to my nose.
Without having sex?
Hah!
My career is so over.
Thank God I'm getting...
"Oh,my God,my ring is gone!"
Now don't freak out.
I'm not freaking out.
You know I'm great at this.
I'm not freaking out.
A earring?
No.
Engagement ring.
"I'd ask you to help,but I doubt you know what one looks like and I don't have time to draw you a picture."
You always underestimate me.
"Seriously,dude,I almost peed my pants."
Thank you!
What are you doing?
Nothing.
I'm starving.
Thought maybe you'd join me for brunch.
Forever?
I don't think it'll take that long.
"Elliot,I don't want to just be your girlfriend."
What makes you think being your half girlfriend's making me any happier?
You're not hating me as much.
"I want a life partner, not bi-weekly sex and a hangout buddy."
"I'm on the soul mate path,man."
No stopping or standing.
I don't want you to come to the wedding with me.
And I don't want to see you anymore unless it's about Rufus.
"But, brant's bio is not exactly call sparking."
"But, brant's bio is not exactly call sparking."
"He is a bit of a loner, but he's a solid agent."
The FBI is the only family he's got.
His parents were a horror story.
I don't give a shit about his family life.
Can we trust him?
"Sir, when I started out I worked in the field with brant."
"He'd run through a wall for you if he believes in you, but you betray him, you don't want to be on the same fucking planet."
You don't want to be on the same fucking planet.
"Wonder boy or not, I'm putting back up on this case."
You're the boss.
"So, so what kind of job?"
"Oh, don't worry Nick."
It's an easy job.
Easy.
Choose one.
"Easy job, huh?"
Don't you have a regular guy for this?
Don't you have a regular guy for this?
He's not with us anymore.
We must all make adjustments.
Let's go.
Wonderful.
So where are we gong boys?

Let's go!

"Stay, you are only the watchdog."

Yeah.
FITZGERALD:
Need I remind you we already lost 32 men?
It's 33 now.
"They were my men, Fitzgerald."
I know how many I lost.
We do like Glass says.
That's the end of it.
GLASS:
We have to set the boat loose.
"If the Ree are tracking us, they'll find it downriver."
Best course is to hike inland to the Grand and follow it to Fort Kiowa.
ANDERSON:
On foot?
It'll be winter before we get there.
"Yeah, unless we come across a post, trade for some horses."
Ain't no posts that far over!
"Captain, losing this boat is a goddamn mistake."
The Ree ain't that stupid.
"We keep it, we can lay it up around Arrow's Peak."
Quit acting like you know what you're talking about.
Ain't nobody talking to you.
Who'd listen to you anyway?
Can't find your way out of your breeches to take a shit.
All I'm saying is Camp Rhulen is just up the way.
We can hole up there.
We walk.
"Yeah, I'm sure we will."
Wish my dad was a doctor.
Then he could've bought me a captain's job.
"What do we do, eh?"
Pray these pelts ain't rotten if we ever get back here?
- I am needed on the quarterdeck.
- Why are you needed?
There's a sea running.
I've been listening to it.
I know that I'm right.
You always have to be right.
"So in case we have to reduce sail, may I return to the deck?"
It is my place.
And my duty.
Your first duty on leaving this cabin is to see all is well in the midshipmen's berth.
- But surely Mr. Kilpatrick...
- Will do as you tell him.
I want the boy left alone.
- He's taken more than enough.
"- You mean your son, sir?"
You know very well I do.
"I shall see to it for you, sir."
- May I now be returned to duty?
- You may.
Scott-Padget!
Why are we not under full sail?
"I judged it to be inadvisable, sir."
- Carry on working.
- What do you want?
- You.
- We need a lawyer.
- I'm not one yet.
- You've studied law.
- You can read documents for us.
- I might give advice...
- We want help with our petition.
- For redress of grievances?
That's right.
"It'll beverydirty, because he strictly forbade me to go in and clean it."
"I wasn't going to charge him a cent, but..."
"Don't worry, I'll take care of that."
Shall I give you the key?
Yes.
I'll see if I can find it.
Have you seen him?
Yes.
And how is he?
Fine.
The poor thing didn't even have any luck in jail.
He got very little publicity.
"Not one lousy television came here, nor one lousy paparazzi."
"With all the trashy shows there are, not one bothered to come and interview me."
"It's sad the state of the ""massesmedia"" in this country."
"Yes, you're right."
The keys...
"Oh, yes."
Thank you.
"By the way, do you know why Benigno is in jail?"
"He's so quiet, the last time he came he didn't say a word."
Benigno is innocent.
Of course.
But innocent of what?
I don't know.
"Of course you do, but you don't want to tell me."
But I'll get it out of you.
All right.
"So long, ma'am."
"If you need anything, you know where I am."
"OK, thanks."
Stop!
I don't know what to do.
I don't know if I'm standing still or I'm swimming.
Swim now!
Stop!
They're torturing me!
They're playing with me!
They're slow-playing me!
Shoot them!
Swim slowly.
"Swim, swim, swim."
Save yourselves!
Go to shore!
It's too late!
They've got me!
It's only a matter of time!
"There's no sharks around you, honey."
"You're safe now, baby."
I don't know what's going through my mind!
I'd love some ice cream.
What?
"I'd love some ice cream, with maybe some pecans in it!"
Couples' massage is part of your program and so important.
"It gives you the chance to bond, relax, reconnect."
We prefer to bond on our own.
"Okay, would you prefer male or female therapists?"
"What would you recommend more for like a nurturing, pampering, motherly energy?"
"Would that be a man or a woman, do you think?"
A woman.
"Well, I'm just so tight in my shoulders."
Do you have any...
Let me see.
-I can take care of him.
This is our house!
This is your gift for me on our wedding.
"You know, we have a privacy here."
It's near my workplace so I can check up on you during my break.
Raya also promised that she'll look after you when I'm on duty.
"Migs, you're my husband."
I will serve you.
I'll do everything for your memory to come back.
"Migs, I need you."
I want to go home.
When are you taking me home?
You don't have to do this.
I'm your wife.
"I love you so much, Migs."
It'll just worsen the situation.
He thinks you are his girlfriend.
"Ara, I'm scared."
But I'm scared of giving my whole heart again.
"Knowing that one day, his memory will come back."
Joy is his wife.
But you're the one he loves right now.
I badly want to love him even if I know it's wrong.
But it's hard to get hurt.
Will you get my bag please?
It really has a different appeal.
Daddy's so proud of her because...
So that's why you dad was in a Hummer when I saw him in Toronto.
What are you doing there?
.
It's work.
I have an exhibit to stage for my client next week.
I was just thinking about you.
That's nice.
I like the sound of that.
It's the craziest thing.
"All my life, the only thoughts I had were about one person."
Me.
I think it was mostly a survival instinct.
"Anyway, suddenly I'm walking along, alone, and then, bam!"
I think of you.
(CHUCKLES)
"And the next thing I know, I've got this dumb grin on my face, like I'm high or loaded or something."
Only I'm not high or loaded.
I'm just thinking of you.
Is that the grin?
Yeah.
I think that's it.
It's not so dumb.
"You want to kiss me, don't you?"
Yeah.
I do.
But not here at school.
We can't keep hiding out in people's cars.
Would your grandmother let us make out in the living room?
"I think she would, but I wouldn't be comfortable with that."
"Would your mother, your foster mother, let us make out in her living room?"
Not a chance.
Is this him?
Yeah.
What do you think?
"It's not bad, kind of the dark and brooding type."
"Like James Franco, just not as tall or good-looking."
He looks either really smart or really dumb.
It's okay.
Why are you saying she's my wife?
.
I don't even know her.
I know it's hard for you to believe.
But this is true.
Joy is your wife.
You love her so much.
Your memory will come back soon.
"But for the meantime, we're just here for you."
Recognize Joy.
So you will remember her.
...as her husband.
"Adel, is this serious?"
.
You had a speedy recovery Migs.
Just a little more therapy...
But expect some disorientation...
That's just a part of your recovery process.
"As of now sir, we just have to wait."
We can't tell when his memory will come back.
"What we can advise is, don't let him get too stressed."
"But Doc, what do we have to do?"
Those he can remember.
Why don't you and Migs stay over at our place for now?
.
In his room.
Because he might get more confused if you lived there in your new house.
We'll just go home.
I'm his wife.
I'll take care of him until his memory returns.
-But Joy...
Two aliens have orgasms.
They don't even have bodies.
Oh!
You're an alien in this country.
And I wouldn't certainly complain about your body.
Do sit down.
Well being a German alien and a scientist.
What do you think about German alien orgasms?
I want you now.
That's too good.
What's your hurry?
I'll do anything you want.
Do you want to hit me?
You are sick.
"Sure I'm baby, I've got so many problems with my brain it's a real pain in the ass."
"Ho, yeah."
"Look stop, I'm gonna come."
"Give it to me, baby, give it to me."
"come on , come on."
Suppose orgasms are killing people.
What would you say about a person who had multiple orgasms?
I would say this person is very sick.
And would you be interested into studying such a person?
Being a scientist?
And German alien?
Come on...
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
"I'm sorry, I can't stay, I must go with, she's in great danger."
I'm sorry.
Shit.
"Excuse me, do you know anybody here by the name of Adrian?"
Easy!
"I was in... the apartment, all alone, Henry."
I...
I didn't know what to do.
C'mon!
Give me your shoe!
That's it!
"- I'm sorry, Henry."
"- Okay, you'll just stay here then, c'mon, c'mon."
"- Oh, Henry!"
"- Yeah, that's good!"
- I love Rose.
- I know.
I...
"I love the OLD Rose, the one with no makeup, and baggy clothes, who loves the perfect bite."
"I love her, it's real."
It's not based on passion... although I feel that.
Or lust... although...
I feel THAT.
"Or... or even physical attraction, because she wasn't... although I..."
I thought she was quite beautiful.
"Her eyes, her mouth, the way she held herself, the way she made fun of herself."
"She eats carrots now, isn't that tragic?"
What am I going to do?
Do you know that in the last two years I've been with 11 different women?
"Most of them half my age, not one with a sense of humor I understood."
"Now, I don't date these girls because they're well read."
"I gave one a copy of ""A Farewell to Arms"", she thought it was a diet book."
- Can I help you?
"- Yes, I want to see a Miss Morgan."
"It's kind of late to be visiting people, don't you think?"
"Please, just ring her apartment."
"You're 13 now, and what you could do is serious."
Like riding on Daniel's bike and crash into a truck.
That doesn't matter to you.
Of course it matters to me.
No.
Only if I've slept with Daniel.
That is my concern me too.
"-No, just that!"
"If you get so upset, maybe you did something!"
You always said I should do what seems right to me.
And I'll always tell you that!
-Then that's it.
So you've slept with him?
Don't be like that.
-How do you want me to be?
"If you'd tell me the truth, you'd feel more calm."
"You'd feel more calm, but you won't!"
Why don't you stay the night here?
I told you I couldn't.
-I didn't get that impression.
What then?
What's the matter?
Truth is nobody could find you for six days.
Alright?
You can do whatever you want.
Of course.
That's what I'm saying.
But not what you're thinking.
Do you know my thoughts better than me?
"I see you're going to sermonize me about what I've done, or what you or we've done."
I've never asked you to change your behavior.
Regardless of what I could think.
It's just Insurance.
You weren't going to kill my men after all.
No.
"We weren't, we..."
"Shh, shh, shh, shh... (WHISPERING) Now I can choose not to kill you."
"So, shall we discuss where your transport is?"
Uh...
"How many people have you killed, rescuing me?"
I don't know.
"Less than I'll save, if I get that information."
That doesn't make it right.
It's still playing God.
Mmm...
"It's a doctor's prerogative, is it?"
Don't preach to me.
"(CRYING) No, I'm not."
I'm sorry.
I've spent my whole life trying to prove I was different from him.
Only to realize that I'm just the same.
I've killed people.
I killed my own fiance.
That wasn't your fault.
It was my fault.
It was my fault that we were abducted.
He hated the camps.
"He hated the danger, and I made him stay."
Because I wanted to save that boy's mother.
"But, I didn't save her."
She died anyway.
"So, they'd blame you too, would they?"
"They're dead now, and you'll never forgive yourself because neither would they?"
(SNIFFLING) They deserved to live.
Damone?
"Yeesh, I'm really kind of busy."
"Come on, just do me this one favor."
"All right, but you owe me for this one."
"Oh, thanks, Damone."
And that was the last we ever saw of him.
"Well, well, well."
Who do we have here?
"It's me, Chris, you know me."
Why are you talking like a bad guy?
"Listen, I saw you steal money from Mom's purse."
Oh...
"Well, I was just trying to get new sneakers."
"You're not going to tell on me, are you?"
"Well, that depends."
On what?
"How about, I won't tell Mom and Dad about the money if you promise to do whatever I say."
"Meg, this is how a lot of porn starts."
"I mean it, Chris."
I'll tell them.
"Mom, Chris took money out of the..."
"Okay, okay, okay."
I'll do whatever you want.
I thought you'd see it that way.
Here's a list of stuff I need you to do for me.
"Shouldn't have taken that money, Chris."
"Eh, she's right."
I'm a horrible person.
I'm only one step above those people who really like dive bars and really need you to know it.
I love this place.
I love dive bars.
Dive bars are my favorite.
"Excuse me, you've got a tag here."
I can't get it.
Where the fuck is my eyelash collar?
I get so mad.
These stupid people...
Here it is!
We're gonna do it this time!
We're gonna...
I think maybe we should get back out there.
We've got some time left.
They won't be finished for a while.
I'm gonna sew you out.
It's hideous out there.
I can't take it anymore.
I just walked off.
"I don't feel well, Paul."
I just wanna go home and cuddle off with you.
"Okay, I'II..."
- I'm gonna get your car.
- You're so sweet to me.
- I had a great time the other day.
- Me too!
I loved working with you at the shoot.
And I think we make great walking partners
- We should consider the marathon.
"- Listen, Jocelyn..."
I think you are amazing... and I loved... that walk with you as well... and I loved hanging out with you on the shoot... and God only knows I'm always so happy when I see your face...
I think we make great friends...
But...
Resin is a little pissed off because that I see so much of you... and I realized that...
I just hope I wasn't giving you the wrong idea.
No.
Come on.
Get to work.
You'd think they'd feed you more if they expect you to do all this work.
That's what Eric said.
He always gave me half his rations.
Refused to eat them himself.
If he'd eaten more...
He's gone.
My team must have taken care of it.
We're gonna need a new plan.
- There's always Death Valley.
- No.
What's Death Valley?
That's Death Valley.
- See that door on the other side?
- Yeah.
It takes you to the front gate.
- If that's the only way...
- We're completely exposed.
"Also the barbed wire, searchlights, guard tower."
Goons can see everything from up there.
We'd be fish in a barrel.
It's out of the question.
You need to call your people off.
We're better off with the tunnel.
Your tunnel will take months to finish.
You could be relocated before it's ready.
"But if it works, we can get everybody out."
"Two hundred of you, running around the forest?"
"No papers, no clothes, no place to hide?"
You'll be hunted like dogs.
"Yeah, it's risky."
I'll get seven.
- The next man.
- That's it.
- Any word?
- They say he'll be here any minute.
"You know, I told Margaret this would happen."
"I always say, marry in haste, repent at leisure."
The young man is now one hour and 25 minutes late.
That isn't exactly marrying in haste.
"As long as I am living, and longer..."
I have never seen cuffs on pants like these.
"What's the matter, can't you make them?"
I can make anything... but I would rather not be wrong than right.
I'm paying for cuffs and I want cuffs.
"No. 10 times... 20 times, no."
Can't you understand?
"Look, here, let me show you."
Do you see any cuffs there?
Not one cuff.
Thousands of no cuffs.
"Here, look these over."
You see?
No cuffs.
Millions of no cuffs.
No cuffs.
"More than that, positively not one cuff."
Why not?
- I want to speak to Mr. Garnett.
- Speaking.
"- Here he is, sir."
- Let me talk to him.
"Say, listen, you, the guests are all going home and..."
trust me.
I mean you're afraid of a real relationship Dale.
Why does everyone keep saying that?
I am not scared of relationships
But you're scared of something.
Let's just forget about it.
Ok...
Sorry.
No it's Ok I just wasn't expecting that.
Was it weird seeing Dale?
"Yeah, yeah it was weird."
I felt like I sensed something between you guys.
"Yeah, yeah I think maybe you did."
Dale and I are really tight.
You know and as I told you before Hallie
I'm just not that interested in a relationship right now and I wouldn't want anyone to get the wrong impression about what's going on here.
She's the one that told me to pursue you just so you know.
She told you that?
Yeah you sound surprised.
She said you guys were just friends that you've never hooked up and that she isn't your type.
Not my type.
So are we cool?
"Yeah, yeah we're cool but I just..."
I don't think this is a very good idea right now OK?
This isn't a good idea?
OK I'm just...
Not that into this right now.
You're not into this?
No.
Are you into this?
Hey!
"Hey, Hayden."
"That equipment will bring back anyone for a while, but long term..."
It was my fault.
"I am responsible for what happened to Clara, she was in my care!"
What is the point of blaming yourself?
None.
Because she's going to live.
Hello.
"They all think I'm going to die, don't they?"
And I know you're going to live.
How?
I never know how.
I just know who.
The green lady... she said you were the saver of worlds once.
Are you going to save this one?
"If I do, will you come away with me?"
Yes.
Well then.
Merry Christmas.
I have in my hand a piece of the Ice Lady.
Everything you need to know about how to make ice people.
Is that what you want?
See you at the office.
"So then, Doctor, saving the world again?"
Might I ask why?
Are you making a bargain with the universe?
You'll save the world to let her live?
Yes!
"And don't you think, after all this time and everything I've ever done, I'm owed this one?"
I don't think the universe makes bargains.
It was my fault.
Well then.
Better save the world.
"- Oh, my..."
And you really are serious about getting yourself killed?
I figure it's people who visit me today as well.
"Small world, cos uh..."
me and Vi hate those guy's guts.
"Two months ago Violet ran into them, and they locked her in a dumpster."
It looks like someone had taken a life out of her.
Is that all they did?
"You mean, locked her in that trashcan?"
"Well, yea, I mean that's all she told me."
What else would they...?
Russ is such an ass.
"Thinks he's smart, but he's not."
Nothin' to say this time?
Maybe you've learned your lesson after all.
I'd like a something' for you to tell your boss.
In this fuckin' economy that chicken shit must be pretty hard up.
"to send a little... cunt like you, to do a men's job."
Fuck you later!
- Hi.
"- We're closed, what do you want?"
- I don't know what you're talkin' about.
- Yeah you do.
The black door in the back.
Much obliged.
How can I help you?
"Let's go, let's go, come on."
Move fast.
Check out those boxes right there.
"Let's go, move on."
"""But dude!"
"You're a vegetarian!"""
"Fine, okay."
What did you do yesterday?
Same.
You win or lose?
You look like you just got out of an all-night game.
"Dad, sitting second chair on this case was a really big deal for me."
Okay?
"You could just maybe, I don't know, pretend..."
Pretend to be proud.
I just don't want you to do anything you're gonna regret.
Or are you just taking pot shots at me because I didn't become a cop like you?
Were.
- Listen to me.
Are you proud of what you do?
"This is what you do, man."
This is...
"You know, you dig at me and you dig at my job."
And you know what?
I don't need it.
I don't want it.
I...
"I'm just gonna go, Dad."
See you.
A big winner.
Hold the avocado.
"Yes, it should be a bipartisan effort."
We have a historic opportunity here.
"We pass this bill, we have the most stringent gun regulations in the country."
We can create a real precedent.
"Look, I need you to get behind me on this."
You.
Not anybody else.
-Oh boy.
Man I can't believe you're gonna try to solve your problems.
By letting your friends make all the sacrifices for you.
I thought your father and I raised you better than that.
[Scoffs] I didn't make them do anything.
They did it on their own.
Oh yeah.
I'm sure Lilly really wants to give up her opportunity to go to Stanford.
Come on.
It's just for this year.
We'll go together next year.
If she gets in again.
And there's no guarantee that she will and you darn well know that.
[Softly] Keep it down.
They'll hear you.
I'm in your head!
[Loudly] I can talk as loud as I want to!
"[Groaning] All right, all right."
-Jeez!
I'm annoying sometimes.
-Tell me about it.
And what about Jesse?
Do you really think he's happy about being despised.
By millions of people for breaking my heart?
Ha-ha!
You said my heart.
We have the same heart and I know it's not broken.
"What do I have to say to that, huh?"
I'll tell you what I have to say.
If you go on letting your friends do this for you.
Sure they seem okay with it now.
But deep down inside they're going to hate you for it.
A hat?
What the fuck is this?
Police!
Freeze!
"Don't move, motherfucker!"
I'll blow your brains out!
Shut the car off slowly!
"For a second I thought I was dead, but when I heard all the noise I knew they were cops."
Only cops talk that way.
Don't fucking move.
"If they had been wiseguys, I wouldn't have heard a thing."
I would have been dead.
Michael!
Lock the door!
Talk to me.
When was the last time you took a collar?
"Hey fuckhead, I'm talking to you."
"You don't want to say a fucking word, don't. I don't give a fuck."
"25 years, pal, that's what you're gonna do."
See how much of a good guy you'll be then.
All day I thought the guys in the helicopter were just local cops busting my balls over Lufthansa.
They turned out to be narcs.
Just get the lawyer.
They'd been on me a month.
"Phone taps, surveillance, everything."
You know the boys.
All the pals are here.
"You don't want to talk to me, you'll have a fucking problem all night."
Each one of these counts holds 25-to-life in New York State.
"25 fucking years, pal."
I'll slap your fucking head inside out.
"What, were you guys grocery shopping?"
You can have a job here if you work like everyone else.
That's good enough for me.
"Thanks, dad."
"I know you weren't coming down for lunch, so I thought..."
"It's such a beautiful day, darling."
Why don't you get dressed and go for a walk?
"You haven't spoken with me for over a week, since..."
"Allison, I understand how you feel."
You'll just have to accept what's happened... make the best of it.
Mother?
"As soon as I can, I'm going to get dressed... pack my things and leave Peyton Place."
I never want to see this town or you again.
-You can't mean that.
-I mean it.
I'm going to New York.
"Please, Allison, I was only trying to protect you."
I was an accident that you hated and tried to hide.
But I loved you from the moment you were born.
Try to believe me.
"Well, how will you live?"
What will you do for money?
I have enough to get there.
I'll find a job.
Suppose you can't find a job.
"Then I'll live off some man, the way you did."
"Oh, God..."
"God, help me!"
Allison!
Allison!
I didn't want you to come down here.
I couldn't say good-bye to you.
-You know I don't want you to go.
"Now, we've made a lot of plans and I won't let you upset them."
I want some money.
Fast.
"Letha, we are worlds apart."
My mind is filled with large concepts.
"Mankind, the universe."
You only worry about the horse that's running in the third race.
"Sure, I gamble But with my own money."
You're the worst kind of gambler.
You use other people's money
And want to keep all the winnings for yourself.
"Well, you can be sure of one thing, Victor."
I'll be around to pick up the chips with you.
- [wires pop and sizzle] - [Tony moans] [panting] [grunting]
We'll be back in the morning with maps and breakfast.
I'll bring an egg from my refrigerator.
And I'll bring some day-old bread.
- I'll bring some milk for you.
- Thank you.
- You're good friends.
- That's the trouble with us.
We don't want to be good.
We want to be bad.
Yeah.
"Hey, uh, let's go, you guys."
My mom's gonna yell at me.
"[crusher] see you tomorrow, Tia."
[muscles] we'll find Tony tomorrow for sure.
"[Rocky] let's stay close together on the way out, guys."
[sighs]
Good.
This is professor Gannon...
Good thing we have A truck and we drive.
But now captain kris kelly.
Has secured a deal To mine 80-miles inland.
Through alaskan bat country On the kougarok river.
This day's gonna be A good day.
I got a buddy that says He's gonna put us on a claim.
That's for sure good gold.
"But, like, it's a little bit Off the beaten path."
Because there's no Easy gold left out there.
River mining will be A new experience for the Kellys.
"Well, We're almost here."
And the first challenge...
Getting to the river.
That's where We are on this road.
Where's the claim?
The claim is right here.
You see these Little strips here?
- Those are roads.
- I'm pretty sure they're roads.
- Me.
- Man.
My buddy said That we're gonna find.
A trail already marked And it's how he gets there.
"What's the marked the trail, What's it say?"
It doesn't say anything.
It's just a trail in the middle.
Of nowhere on the side Of the road in about this area.
"How's it marked, though?"
It's not marked.
It's just a trail.
You said it was just marked.
A marked trail.
He's stepping out on you already?
I'm gonna kill him.
That's the point.
There's nothing to step out on.
"Oh, good."
"Not yet, anyway."
Not yet?
!
"Look, I know you don't like him, but he's the first guy in a long time that I actually have fun with."
Fun?
"Honey, trust me."
Fun doesn't last.
My third wife-- a barrel of monkeys.
"Dad, it's more than that."
It's like I feel like there's a connection.
"Oh, dear God."
"I'm not saying I know what it is, but I'd like to keep just seeing him and find out."
"What's to find out, honey?"
"He's brash, he's rude..."
He's rude?
You called him an idiot.
And Roberta.
"Sweetheart, sometimes I just get worked up, because I care about you so much."
"I know you do, Dad."
Will you do me a favor?
"When this magazine comes out and you get all these offers, will you just test the waters a little bit before you settle on..."
Roberta?
"Well, my dad's talking to me again."
That's great.
He must be happy you're still going to be on that Ten Most Eligible list.
"Yeah, about that."
I'm not gonna be on that list.
He looked down and realised that she is a he!
"Man, that's bullshit!"
You mean to tell me that the whore was wearing nothing but a thong and this fool can't tell no difference?
"Hey, man. he had one of them ""tuck jobs""."
"Come on Jones, you know how they do that."
"You might, I don't!"
"Yeah, whatever."
"You Reznik, you wanna go for some cards tonight?"
"Can't, got plans."
Shit!
"See, this nigger say the same thing every poker night."
"Hey, what's up with you?"
You used to be alright.
"Well, he used to hang but he ain't never been alright."
"You need to realise, Jackson, that some men prefer the company of women."
Who!
"Howdy duty, he don't get no booty."
"Maybe he has got a date by the name ""tuck jobs""."
"No, your mother said she couldn't make it."
Oh!
"Reznik talking smack, I can't even respond to that."
You okay?
Do I look okay?
"If you were any thinner, you wouldn't exist."
What's wrong?
"I don't know, déjà vu."
"You are tired, you need to sleep."
How do you do it?
What?
Sleep so little and still look so good.
Are you flirting with me?
Commiserating.
I don't know what's wrong with him.
"One second he was calming down and then the next-- well, where's the surgeon?"
He's back on the ship.
"Well, you better take care of my brother!"
"Yes, sir."
"Go, lad."
"Go now, lad."
Easy does it.
Put him on the table.
His throat's constricted.
Maybe he swallowed an insect and it stung him.
His only hope is if I can open his throat below the swelling.
"Well, do it!"
"If you have a god, pray to him now."
"If not, I suggest you get one quick."
The ghost pointed at him and now he's dead.
Shut up!
I'll take his body and bury him at sea.
And I trust ya to take care of things while I'm gone.
Of course.
I'll be back.
Haibal didn't have gunpowder when he crossed the alps.
He broke up rocks with fire and vinegar.
Shall I tell you how?
You always do this to me when I cannot get away.
What's wrong with expanding your horizons?
Makes my head hurt.
"Crusoe, you should stop worrying."
We have a plan.
I just want to go home.
"Hey, you should take a slug."
You should take it easy.
It's been out there ever since.
"It feeds three, four times a year."
Takes two or three people each time.
Two years after the crash it took my own son.
That's it.
One Wraith in the forest.
Yes.
I'll be done by morning.
We all go together.
In the daylight.
Are you really going to help us?
"Like the man said, it's just one Wraith."
It'd be downright unneighbourly if we didn't.
"In that case, drinks are on me."
Well... let's not forget the food.
What?
Is it true?
You're going to hunt the Daemus?
It looks that way.
"I heard it has two heads and it can turn you into stone, just by looking at you."
Well you heard wrong.
My uncle say's it'll come and take me if I don't do my chores.
He said that?
"Well then, if we get rid of it, you got nothing to worry about."
You'll never have to do chores ever again!
- Really?
"- Yes, look, go away!"
What?
"As far as we know, no-one was taken last night."
But it will strike and soon.
"Well, we'll kill it before that happens."
You must be great at parties.
- What are you doing?
- You're sweating.
"I've never met anybody quite like you, Jack."
I wish things were different.
I'm really a pretty likable guy when I'm not a fugitive.
I wish things were different too.
Isn't it funny how people meet?
"I mean, they can come from two totally different worlds... and never even know each other exists."
And then one day they meet and their lives are never the same.
- Are you married?
- No.
Do you have a girlfriend?
"No, I don't have a girlfriend."
And it's true that... you haven't been with a woman in a couple of years?
"It's true, yeah."
"If all this doesn't work out, you'll go back to prison, right?"
Probably.
"So it's conceivable that... you'd never be with a woman ever again, right?"
Right.
What are you doing?
Falling in love with you.
"Natalie, you can't..."
We can't do this.
I can't help it.
We may never have this chance again.
Wait a second.
Wait a second.
Can't see the road.
There it is.
There's the road.
"Ten more miles, do or die."
What the hell is he swerving all over for?
Hmm.
This one must be very good-looking for you to go to all this trouble.
I hate lipstick.
I can't stand it.
That's not a good color for you.
Did you try the samples I brought home?
It doesn't matter.
I'm not going.
What do you want to do for dinner?
I don't care about dinner.
I'm upset.
Can't you see that I'm upset?
How should I know?
You're always so relieved when you cancel your dates.
This is not a date.
We're just agreeing to eat at the same table.
"Then why does it matter how you look, unless you think something might happen with this one?"
"Mother, would you stop calling him ""this one."""
It sounds like you're picking out a lobster.
And nothing's going to happen.
He just likes the way I teach.
- You need more color.
- More color than this?
- Yes.
Would you sit down and let me do it?
- All right.
- Don't make me look like a clown.
- You won't look like a clown.
"Here, you have to blend."
- Where's the hairpiece?
- Here.
Do you want me to make you something before I leave?
"Well, I'm not beat, you understand?"
I'm just a little more respectful.
But I am thirsty.
"Thanks a lot, anyway."
Now wait a minute!
"You know, I saw a man do that one time down in Mexico."
He come on a great big water hole about an hour later.
"All that sweet water, he didn't have nothing to carry it away in."
Like to see a man with a nice even disposition.
Come on.
I've tracked you for six weeks through this country.
You know it just like the back of your own hand.
Where are we gonna find water?
"Maybe the, maybe the Times' place."
They never have run dry there.
Or so I'm told.
But you're gonna give out before we get there.
Tyree.
You don't figure I did this.
Possible.
Hasn't been dead half a day.
"Well, what about Silmser?"
You don't think I stabbed him in the back and did this to him.
Let's bury him.
I asked you a question!
Did you murder a man in Texas?
"I did kill a man, but that was long ago and far away and he had a gun in his hand."
"Now, will you take these chains off?"
"Yeah, there was a girl here, too."
She's gone.
They probably took her.
They?
"That's the lens, you see."
That's an optical illusion.
"She stands rightside down on the lens- i mean, she stands upside right- the lens is downside up- who sent for you?"
"I just thought she was standing on her head, that's all."
Will you do me a favor?
Go over there and sit down.
Please?
And just mind your business.
Thank you.
Wait just a second.
Now-that's right.
Put the hand back.
All right.
Now hold it.
Now-now smile.
Wait... here it comes.
"One... two... 3... 4... fmmph... what's that ""fmmph"" thing you've got in there?"
Fmmph.
That comes between 4 and 6.
Fmmph is... 8... 5... now he picks out a time to ask me what is a fmmph!
Fmmph!
You-you spoiled the whole thing!
Now i got to do it all over again.
"Now, right here... you hold the bird, will you?"
That's right.
"Here, now comes it."
Here it comes.
The first time i saw you i knew at a glance i was meant to be yours yours alone as i stood before you my heart seemed to dance and i felt like a queen on a throne
i could see in your eyes love as bright as the skies and i prayed you would call me your own the first time i saw you i knew at a glance i was meant to be yours yours alone
were you singing that song to me?
"You flatter yourself, don't you?"
And if i were?
I'm sorry.
"She stopped by, my mind was elsewhere."
I didn't pay attention.
What are you waiting for?
Help me look for it.
Here it is.
My husband has a safe in a bank.
The key is in the left drawer of the desk and the contract is in a Bible in the library.
"Well, this is good news."
Isabelle?
You cut your hair.
It suits you!
Your clerk told me I could find you here.
Can I sit down?
I heard about your mother.
"I didn't have a family before, now there's no one left."
It doesn't make a difference.
- And why didn't you tell me?
"- No, I..."
"No, I wasn't going to tell you about it."
And you wanted some time to think... about us.
"Yes, I thought about it."
"I want to carry on, François."
Whether it suits my son or not...
I am entitled to live my life.
But you... you're not afraid of falling out with him?
He'll get over it.
"For the moment, you're the one that matters."
Will you say the same thing in the future?
The mayor of Villedieu will be searched tomorrow.
There will be consequences.
I'll be dragged through the mud.
"Wouldn't be fair to you, or to us either."
Slow us down to a walk and make us carry double provisions.
"Besides, it's more of a risk than I want to see you take."
"Believe me, that's my only reason for making this decision."
"If you don't like my way of doing it, do it yourself."
- You can have my share.
"- Oh, so you're gonna give me my mine, are you?"
"Well, thank you very much."
You'll not leave this town without me.
We'll leave without you.
You'll wait here and like it.
"All right, come on."
Let's get going.
- How about the iodine and quinine?
- I'll get them.
"If that female iceberg comes out and wants to tag along, smack her down."
Wonder what's happened now.
"Oh, well."
"You know, I know a couple of people used to fool around like that... and they got children now."
"You, uh"
- You still want to go along?
"Not only do I still want to go, I am going."
"All right, come on."
Let's get going.
Come on.!
Mush!
Mush!
Come on.!
Hey!
Hey!
Come on!
Mush!
So that's the problem?
The only difference is that he got caught.
I sit in that courthouse every day and I see how they're doing him wrong.
"Ora, I'm sorry."
"If you need money, I can arrange a loan."
"I want you to tell my daughter, I want Goni to hear."
Why doesn't Daddy's friend come to visit her?
And why he won't let her daddy direct when he knows the truth about all of this?
Please tell her.
I'm sorry.
My darling.
My love.
Did you work on the adaptation?
"What adaptation, Mommy?"
It's a play I did for the theater and I'm adapting it for the school.
For the prison you're going to.
"No, for the school where I'll be working after I get out."
Plays in the theater are more fun.
Schools are nice too.
Then why not at my school?
Maybe there too.
Will you direct me?
That could be very nice.
I told the school they'd get a draft next week.
So they can see it's suitable for kids.
I'll get it ready.
It's annoying that they have to check everything.
Isn't your word good enough?
Why isn't it good enough?
That's the way it is.
Why?
"I want to hear ""There Were Nights""."
You've made a new friend.
- Are you the new volunteer?
- He's a lawyer.
He and I are gonna throw a doctor's ass in the slammer.
"Oh, well... see you later."
Bye.
You smell that stink?
Like something's rotting?
Behind the stink of detergent... can't you smell that?
It reeks of death around here.
Why do you think she puts up with it?
She had a kid who died.
That's why.
"All of us in here are going out in body bags, and she knows that."
She thinks that when we see her little darling up there we'll tell him how mommy's doing.
And we'll take care of him.
Make sure he eats his dinner and goes to the potty up in Heaven.
"Volunteer, my ass."
What about you?
"You got a message to send, too?"
"Who you got up there, huh?"
"I'm going soon, so make the most of it."
"Some ""dearly beloved?"""
- Or maybe...
- Excuse me.
Hey!
"Hey, come back."
I didn't mean it like that.
I don't know how to die.
None of us know how to die.
But maybe... somewhere deep inside of us a part of us does know how.
Maybe it's not as terrible as it seems.
You always have it your way.
Okay thank you.
I will send it in.
You still have time to see me?
I've been standing here for a while now.
I feel like I'm making life hard for you.
"Seriously, why are you here?"
"I'm trying very hard, doc."
This is trying?
Yes.
"It's spread to your ear now, you know that?"
Rash: 50 spots
"If on the outside it's like this, the inside is probably worse."
I understand doc but...
I've been dying to do this job.
And it finally arrived.
You want me to turn it down?
Opportunities like this come once in a life time.
"But you only have one life, right?"
That's right.
"We got one life, so we should do what we want to do."
And do the best we can.
You look like you aren't afraid of dying.
"You just said that we only have one life, right?"
"So we should find what makes us happy, right?"
And what I do makes me happy.
I don't feel tired doing it.
So I work hard and I'm wrong?
"And everyone has to die anyways, right?"
You're a doctor.
You should know that.
You obviously know little about dying.
I'll tell you one thing.
"Whatever he did, you sure ain't copping to it."
Would you?
"Never trust a con, cowboy!"
They ain't get through life being honest.
Where they hiding you these days?
Around.
"Hey, you wanna see something?"
Look at that.
Lost them on a lady.
"Yeah, they took the big toe from the left foot and a pinky from my right."
That is why I walk with a gimp.
"Yeah, I can't shuffle cards like I used to but the ladies sure like it."
"Oh, no."
You look like you have seen a ghost.
Funny you should say that.
The guys from work don't think you exist.
- That is why I can't get a raise.
"- According to Tucker, you are not even on the payroll."
You believe that?
- Why would they lie?
- They're just having a little bit of fun with you.
I'm not laughing.
"Quit fucking around, a guy lost his arm."
He could have died.
That ain't my problem.
"You caused the accident, not me."
Where're you going?
"Take a leak, you wanna watch?"
"I'll be right back, don't just bail me now."
Son of a bitch.
- Hello?
Victor.
"Victor, you are risking his life."
He's my nephew.
My only living relative.
He's the only one I can leave my my bankruptcy to.
"That's what experimentation is all about, Letha."
We cannot afford to lose him.
I am the only one we cannot afford to lose.
Can't you see that I've got complete control over his mind?
"He has no fear, no memory, no will."
He can only carry out my commands.
What... what's happening?
We're out of gas.
"What are you, crazy?"
"Look at the dial, it points to... empty."
Empty?
It was all that waiting I had to do for youse.
I'll run down the street to the gas station and get some gas.
"Boy, oh, boy."
You guys are costing me a lot of dough.
I sure hope you make the tip worth it.
Something's going to happen to someone near here.
We've got to help.
"No, I think you'd better stay here and wait for the driver."
I'll go.
I think it came from back that way.
Be careful.
And remember what Uncle Bene said.
That is enough.
Bring him down!
"Sickle, turn to your right."
Balance yourself and walk along the ledge.
There's more?
"Oh, if anyone finds a Xanax, it's mine."
It was knocked out of my hand by two women duking it out over a chintz mermaid dress.
"Oh, now it looks good."
There's Xanax on the loose and I'm just standing here?
"At least if I was high, I'd have an excuse to be wearing this."
"Here pilly, pilly."
"Here pilly, pilly, pilly."
"Girl, for real, you look like straight up crap in that dress."
For real.
You white girls can't pull that color off.
That's a waste of poppin' lemon yellow.
I know.
I am way too white for this.
"She's also too white to say ""turnt up"" all the time, but that hasn't stopped her."
This dress was not my choice.
I hate everything about it.
This is a disaster.
"This is ""Dressageddon."""
"Yeah, but in a good way."
You two don't want to wear the dresses.
You don't have to.
But I thought you wanted us to match the balloons and the ducks.
"Max, she said we don't have to wear the dress."
Don't question her!
That's like questioning a prison guard when he says you're free to go.
"Sophie, are you sure you don't care?"
"Oh, yeah."
Sure.
"Yeah, they're all yours, Destiny's Child."
This is ten pounds of ugly junk.
"Reminds me of this bartender, Pete, I used to date."
I'd cry when I saw something that moved me because I couldn't share it with her.
There's nothing worse than leaving someone you still love.
What a sad story.
"Love is the saddest thing when it goes away, as a song by Jobim goes."
We have to talk after the fight.
- We've been talking for an hour.
- You.
Not me.
You're right.
The doctor said it would take two months for my leg to heal.
But you know what?
I'm glad the bull gored me.
"Now I can stay with you until you awake, my love."
No one will take me away from you.
We'd gotten back together a month before.
"Lydia was to tell you at the wedding, but when I saw you in the ICU I knew she hadn't."
It was you she was crying for.
She rang to tell me she'd cried thinking of me.
It was the last time we spoke.
"As I'm injured, I won't be fighting for a while."
I'd like to stay with her these nights.
Make yourself at home.
Thank you.
"Hello, Alicia."
I'm alone again.
"Admit it, you were looking at her breasts."
"It's hard not to, they're getting bigger."
I'm thinking of going away.
- How come?
- I have to work.
What about Lydia?
She doesn't need me anymore.
You're going to leave us here?
I could make my life a lot easier and return you to Jacob Moore.
If you would prefer.
"Soon as we clear the rocks, move the main sail!"
Give her everything she can carry!
This ship's mine now.
Not if I have anything to say about it.
Get him!
"Take the wheel, boy!"
This one's for me.
You fight like a man with a lot to lose.
"Well, I have nothing to lose."
Which makes me far more dangerous.
"First blood, I think."
"So, the evil island spirit."
"You going to attack me with a stick, are you?"
"I have a very, very unfair advantage."
Oh?
"Well, we'll just see about that."
Die!
"Hold the wheel steady, boy!"
While I finish him off.
You see?
I have been living the outdoor life.
"Fresh air, plenty of exercise and nutritious food."
You...
"You have been cooped up at sea, eating nothing but broth and dry biscuits."
"Aye, but I still have the beating of a savage in me."
Especially one that cost me so much.
I do not think so.
You can't defeat us all.
Last blood to me as well.
"Now, then, play the whole thing through and play it properly."
"Yes, sir."
Left.!
Left.!
"Left, right, left.!"
"No, no, no!"
That's where we go... down!
"- Oh, it's you again."
"- Yes, I thought it only courteous... to return your visit of last night."
- May I come in?
Thank you very much.
- What do you want?
I just want to talk.
If you'll overlook this informal visit...
I'll forgive you for slighting me in the dining room.
- Spicy little spot you have here.
- I wish you wouldn't follow me.
I'm not following you.
"As much as I'd like to, I'm not following you."
I'm here to do you a good turn— and at the risk of my life too.
Oh!
Very inefficient.
I think you'd better go.
I've had just about enough of this nonsense.
Have you got a license for that machine?
You could be put in jail.
"I was quite aware of that, but don't come any closer."
I can't help it.
You're so irresistible.
- Please don't come near me.
- Would you point that thing away?
There you are.
- I'll fight the guy that says you can't.
- I hope they think that way up front.
Forget it.
You're a cinch.
- You sure you're rooting for the right guy?
- Sure.
Think it over.
"I'm warning you there ain't gonna be no hangovers in no shop I'm boss of, get it?"
"- Okay, Mr. Taylor."
- Oh.
"Starting to red apple the boss already, huh?"
"Well, come on, we'll give them a week's work between now and quitting time."
Sure that will do you?
"Oh, yes, thanks."
I'll return it first thing in the morning.
"Even if you don't, it's all right."
I still owe you four eggs and that half bottle of bluing I got from you.
"- Oh, gee, Betty, that looks swell."
- I hope it tastes all right.
The men are getting hard to please.
Not your pa.
He eats anything.
I trained him like that.
"You know, you gotta train a man just like you would a dog."
So it's Ed Jackson who's hard to please.
Are you going to start that again?
"Yes, I am."
And I'm going to keep it up until you and Ed do something about it.
- What are you waiting for?
- That's what I keep telling her.
I guess it's polite to wait until you're asked.
Don't be silly.
- Is he willing?
- Let me worry about that.
"Karl, go after him."
Okay.
"Hey, watch where you're going!"
What's the big deal?
I'm looking for someone.
"Pardon me, Your Excellency!"
Have you seen a guy with a brown fur collar?
Has a guy with a brown fur collar been in here?
I haven't seen him.
You seen a guy with a brown fur collar?
A brown fur collar?
Lots of guys with brown fur collars come in here.
Who sent you here?
"If you haven't seen the guy, then why should you care?"
Lots of guys with brown fur collars come in here.
See?
He's seen 'em!
We need to know who sent you here.
I don't have to tell you my business.
"If you ask him if a guy with a brown fur collar was in here, then he can ask you who sent you here."
I still don't have to tell you who I am.
"No, my friend."
"If you ask him a question, then he can ask you one too."
Otherwise just don't ask him.
I still don't have to tell you my business!
Then he doesn't have to say if the guy was here.
It's just logical.
Aren't you the clever one!
Fine!
Go on being clever!

Can you believe this shit?
They started a Kickstarter account in my name called Justice For The Kyles.
"I'm not the Kyles, I'm just Kyle."
And I don't need justice.
I get it.
"I mean, you didn't sign up for this."
"If you weren't on the jury, you wouldn't have been downtown, you wouldn't have gotten jumped."
I got jumped because I'm a gay man in a world full of haters.
My mom and dad think I have a gay-bash target on my back.
They're worried any guy I meet at a bar is gonna jump me.
"You didn't meet him at the bar, you got jumped in the alley."
"Right, that's what I said."
That's what I meant.
Do you want something to drink?
"I got all these gift baskets, like fancy tequila and stuff."
What do you want?
What?
- Do you remember Sophia Russo?
She was one of the character witnesses at the trial.
"The cook at the mansion, right?"
Yeah.
I stopped by her house the other night.
"Oh, great."
How's she doing?
She's dead.
"The thing is, the last person to see her alive was a big white dude."
A really big white dude.
Wanna tell me what really happened?
"Here, tell you what."
"I'll take a stab at it, okay?"
You met him in the bar.
We're under attack!
Fight!
(Buwiyum's hideout in Eupru)
Follow me.
You come this way.
Sail south for hundreds of miles?
It's the only way to get food to survive the embargo.
I thank you for saving my life but I can't go on a suicide mission.
No one sets sail now because of the wind.
"(Buwiyum, pirate captain) We'll die before we reach the south."
I know it'll be difficult... but you've sailed the sea for decades.
I risked my life to come here.
Jolbon will collapse if I return with nothing.
I can't let them down when all they want is to fight the Han.
Help me.
Very well.
"I'll sail south as you want, but... make me an offer we can't refuse."
We have to do whatever we can to convince him.
He knows the situation we're in.
He won't go for just anything.
What more does he want from us?
It's hard to say.
He holds the key to the deal.
Take it away.
Your Highness.
If the King won't let me go...
I'll join Jumong in death.
He'll let you and Yuri go if I die.
Your Highness.
Your Majesty.
You must stop Lady Yuhwa.
She hasn't eaten for days.
"You know when you just wake up, and you're sick, and you're just waiting to suck it down."
"Aw, man you could hawk one of those ten feet, easy."
"No, no, no... it's better to blow them out your nose."
"No, no, it's better to suck."
"Now, those are not the best loogies."
My cousin hawked a loogie from the top of the Empire State Building.
Hit a lady in the head.
Killed her.
He's in prison now.
In prison for snot.
"Boom, boom."
"Okay, you guys, come on."
We place here in the time capsule...
The sacred shoe box.
"Okay, in the sacred shoe box, the things we do not understand, to be opened again when all the mysteries of the universe have been revealed to us."
Who's first?
Kevin.
"I found it in my mom's secret drawer, in this plastic box."
I know what this is.
It goes in the bottom of the bathtub to stop the drain.
"No, it doesn't."
It's a diaphragm.
It prevents the passage of sperm into the uterus... in girls.
How do you know that?
I saw it on Nightline.
"I'm telling you, Frank, it goes in the bottom of the bathtub."
I think it's a travel drinking cup.
She'll never miss it.
"Wait, don't drink out of it until we know what it is."
Yeah.
Brad.
I found it in my sister's room.
That should be me.
I should be doing that time.
No.
We went over this.
It's good.
How's it good?
"It's a minimum-security place in Phoenix, and, no, I am not going to tell you which one."
She'll get out of there and she'll be fine.
"You keep your promise and steer clear, and she can have a good life."
She can do what she's supposed to do.
"I mean if I can't be there for her, man, you gotta promise me that you will be."
I promise.
Then you should do something for me.
I was able to fence the watches.
"Don't judge, I'm giving it all to her."
And the car.
"I got a clean VIN number for it, so it's legit, and it just..."
"It'll feel like I'm there with her, you know?"
"Money is not what she needs, not for what's ahead."
Can you just see that she gets it?
Sure.
And one more thing.
"If anything changes, like she does her job, this insanity ends, if she's free..."
I'll send you a postcard.
(SCREAMING)
I'm not what you think!
"You're a thief, and you poisoned me, so, yeah, I'm pretty sure you're exactly what I think."
No!
You have a compass.
I need it!
I don't care what you need.
"(GRUNTS) No, for my son."
Get rid of him.
John!
What are you doing?
"Well, this way you can have the flat all to yourself."
"John mate, please."
I've changed a lot since then.
"I'm sorry about that deodorant, mate."
"Just tell him you'll stay with me, please!"
John!
Please!
What you've got to ask yourself is do you think I won't do it?
That's the only thing that should be on your mind just now.
Do you think that I won't do it?
All right.
"Next time we play chicken, I'll make sure the stakes are worth it."
There's some goodie bags in your room and other essentials.
"Are you gonna tell me who you are, then?"
"No, you'll have to wait until tomorrow now."
ATT:
JOHN MERCER
That one.
I've always thought scarlet suited you best.
It's red and don't be so cheeky.
I thought you'd be bursting with curiosity about the new recruit.
When do I get to meet him?
"Oh, wait, when you decide the time is right."
You know me so well.
You're not scared he'll do a runner?
"No, he's not that stupid."
"So, when do you put him to work?"
Fortunately I do happen to have a case for him.
Good.
"It wasn't a casino, it was a crappy little game in the back of a-a pizza place."
"Hey, hey!"
NCIS is back.
How many slices can I get you gentlemen?
Where's the game?
"Whoa, you can't go back there."
NCIS.
Do not move.
"Okay, look, I admit to hosting the game, but it was all in good fun."
"I mean, all this nonsense about drugging anybody-- that's just crazy."
Found this in the cabinet next to the oregano.
Try again.
"All right, what can I say?"
I'm not proud.
But times are tough.
"I mean, who doesn't need a little extra cash?"
"Cash off the backs of young sailors, serving their country, on liberty, in a crooked game?"
"Hey, the game itself is not crooked."
We deal straight.
They're ain't no sleight of hand here.
Just a little shot of this crap to give you the edge.
What?
They don't comp drinks in Vegas?
"You're not Vegas, Marty!"
This is a drug.
It's not a drink.
This kid died playing your game.
"Oh, no."
No way!
"One of these pills-- it'll make you woozy, but it never killed anybody."
Never.
Tell me about that night.
- Thank you.
Come on in back.
I got a new baby lamb.
"Oh, I'd love to see it."
"Oh, it's darling."
I didn't show you my lizard.
I keep him in a box right there.
"I got some holes punched in it, just so he can breathe."
His name is Pocahontas.
"Used to be, a man didn't have to cook his own meals in his own house."
Times have changed.
"Ma's working, and I'm late for church."
"The way you parade yourself up and down, taking off your clothes..."
- I don't parade up and down.
- You do!
- You just like to show yourself off.
- I don't like to show off!
"Just because we don't live in a palace, doesn't mean we have to act like pigs."
"- We've got a trash can, remember?"
"- Well, well, well."
"If you don't pick it up, somebody else has to."
And it wouldn't harm you to take the garbage out and bury it.
Or do you like living like a pig?
"What do you think you are, always giving orders?"
Take your hands off of me!
Don't you touch her.
Don't you touch her anymore!
Just a little family fracas.
Guess my little girl's getting too big to spank.
"It was my fault, Allison."
I made him mad.
Every family has fights.
I don't mind going 75 to 150 miles a day.
I think this is proof that We need to keep going back.
Captain kris kelly Finally notches a success.
Let's get the boat Ready.
And things are looking up For the kellys.
We're gonna make 100 ounces In the river this season.
Everybody's on my team now.
We're gonna go back there And kill it.
I packed the trailer.
So we can get the quad In the back-up.
- My god.
- -what the
I got too many bills to pay.
You can't do this.
You said you'd use it Before for one day.
I got to work.
"I got to make a living, too."
I need it back down there.
"Gearing up this morning,"
"Getting ready to hit The river again,"
And what happens?
My dad's friend comes along.
That he's borrowing The boat from.
So now I'm back at square one.
I don't have a boat To go river mining with.
I've got a claim that we know There's gold at.
And we just can't get it again.
"Okay, we'll meet You down there."
We'll put it Back in there.
I don't want to go down a bad Road with you guys.
"Don't worry, We'll bring it right back."
Without a dredge Built Specifically for river Mining...
What's the deputy head like?
"Teaches natural history, very good teacher."
He kicked up a bit of a fuss and then said:
Can't you hold on for the last few days?
Do you like any of the girls in the class?
I've only been in this class for a year.
- Only a year?
- l was in another class.
And in that class?
Do you like going to the cinema?
Not really.
"They're showing the BlackTulip, everyone's been... lt's excellent."
Aren't you going to see it?
I don't know.
Would you like to go?
"Well, I... I'd like to."
Today it's on at half past three.
"Calmly, that's the Reverie."
That's a strange Reverie.
Will you ask your parents or shall we go without permission?
I can say I'm going to the cinema.
They'll let me go.
Won't they object to you going with a girl?
"I'll say we're going with the class, after all, we do that."
So we'll meet and go.
Where shall we meet?
I don't know.
That'll do...
That's the Reverie.
Won't it be awkward if we go to the cinema?
Won't some girl be jealous?
It'd be my first time like that.
"Good night, Henry."
He's such a slut.
He's probably slept with half the girls on the campus already.
JACK:
"No, I haven't."
You know how much it costs me to fill up my truck?
A hundred bucks.
"Get a hybrid, man."
It's the only way to go.
"Uh, a little too girly for me."
"Oh, yeah, that's right, sorry."
It was a free car.
"My parents gave it to me, so..."
"It is a little girly, but I'd have to have a very good reason if I wanted to trade it in."
You got a family.
You need something bigger.
Amy's got a bigger car.
"Of course, it's orange."
Why did she pick orange?
"I don't know, some friend of her mother's gave it to her just to annoy her dad."
You both got free cars?
"Yeah, so no car payments."
"If we had car payments, we'd be in trouble."
"You got a scholarship, right?"
"Yeah, you got one too, right?"
Yeah.
"Yours is based on academics, but mine a depends on my game and the coach isn't too happy with me right now."
"Yeah, well, you gotta do what you gotta do."
I don't know.
"Grace, he was with Clementine before you guys were even back together."
He was with Clementine knowing we were going to get back together.
"All right, well, aren't you happy that you didn't have sex with him?"
Because I don't want to be rude when you show up to my house unannounced.
"Like, like right now."
And you're like a tiger.
"And... you throw yourself at me, and I don't have someone to blame right now... but you're the best I can come up with on the fly."
Why aren't you with Dale?
"You're not the typical Hollywood guy, and she needs someone real like that."
"Look, I really don't know what to say to that."
Dale made it pretty clear that she's not interested in me.
You guys just have something between you two.
I've seen guys come in and out of her life.
But I've never seen her be as comfortable and happy as she is when she's with you.
"Whatever she's going through please don't give up on her, Zach."
Just let her work it out.
I'm sorry if I hurt you.
I never meant to do that.
You didn't.
I hurt myself.
I just gotta open my eyes a little wider next time.
"Can we maybe um, hang out just like be friends and stuff?"
"Yeah, I don't see why not."
That'd be good.
Ok.
Good night.
Can we hang out right now maybe?
I don't think that would be a very good idea.
Maybe I can just come in.
Not good.
Right.
Yeah.
"No, no, no, no."
You don't understand.
She wants yellow roses.
"Instead of being caught here and get turned into fur coats, let's go back into the mountain, dad."
How could you say such a thing?
A spell has given us a temporary human form.
"But if we fail that day, we live as a fox forever."
Do you know that?
The pain of having to eat raw meat.
The pain of having to take a dump without toilet paper.
"Ouch, it's rough!"
Oh my God!
"Since we have only one life to live,"
I want to live on two human feet even if it's a short life.
- It's all your fault!
- Wait.
"All they need to do is stay alive until that day, right?"
How will you keep them alive?
We can't afford to pay the medical bills.
And the circus is doing bad.
How can we keep them alive?
Let me go.
"Hey, let him go."
"Okay, tell me."
Do you have any ideas?
Make money.
Make money?
There is nothing we can't do with money.
You mean cold-hard cash?
She's our new girl.
The tail dance is her specialty.

After marrying Shadab... you may have handled life.
But won't be able to life.
"And, Faiz... shall be shattered."
I've been traipsing across this bridge for days now.
Seems I have a long way to go still.
I should be on my way.
Excuse me.
- What do you expect me to do?
- Just stand aside.
And risk falling over the side for a perfect stranger?
Away and bow your head.
You stand aside!
My destination lies at the opposite end of the bridge.
And you'll get there after you back up and I reach that end of the bridge first.
That would waste too much time and time is what I don't have.
So you think you're better than me because you're in a hurry.
"Well, I'm in a hurry too!"
"But, no, you did not think of that, did you?"
That I might be an equal.
No!
"You just consider yourself superior, right off."
You're rude.
"You mistake my comment, sir."
Do I?
You think I'm dumb too?
"No, I..."
"Look, we are both in a hurry."
So I shall hang from these planks and you may walk over.
So you get a peek up my kilt?
That is not what I am suggesting.
"- So you say, you plucky-faced hing-oot!"
- What did you call me?
"So you're deaf too, you clagtail cuddle dreik!"
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
We'll fight for it to the finish.

I borrowed it from Amy.
Kate:
"Yep, sure."
Matt:
That's a pretty deep film for a lowly engineer like yourself.
James:
(Laughs)
Kate:
You shouldn't let him talk to you like that.
James:
He's only messing around.
Matt:
(Crowd noise)
James:
So the accelerator boosts the beam of protons to almost the speed of light.
James:
And then we collide them... here.
James:
And then we detect what's made in the collision.
Amy:
(Sighs loudly)
James:
What's up?
Amy:
I thought I'd got it working!
James:
Got... what working?
Connor (off screen):
Her Higgs simulation.
Kate:
Her... what simulation?
Amy:
Was someone sitting here?
Was it not a dream?
It wasn't a dream!
Gil...
Gil Dong!
Gil Dong!
It wasn't a dream.
"It's you, isn't it?"
"It's really Gil Dong, isn't it?"
It really... is you!
This isn't a dream...
Or is it?
It's not a dream.
Then... are you a ghost?
I'm not a ghost either.
"Then... is it really you, Gil Dong?"
Stupid girl.

Lee:
So I got Chili Mac.
Paul:
I got Train Wreck.
NARRATOR:
Both these dishes are time-honored Boy Scout classics.
"The Chili Mac consists of ground beef, chopped onions, diced tomatoes, macaroni, cheese, and water."
"Train Wreck is a one-dish breakfast with bacon, sausage links, hash browns, and eggs, all mixed together with plenty of syrup."
Paul:
I hope you guys like what I make you.
Child #1:
"If we don't like it, you're going home."
"Keegan ""Yeti:"""
"Ho-ho-Ho, the attitude."
"Rio ""Wolf:"" I know."
"All right, guys."
Go get to it.
Lee:
All right.
Here we go.
NARRATOR:
"One, two, three, go!"
Paul:
"All right, man."
Whoo-hoo!
Stir eggs scrambled with hash browns and thoroughly cook.
Children:
We're hungry!
Child #2:
Move quicker.
We don't got all day.
Paul:
You have to jump!
Twilight:
I'll never make it!
Pinkie Pie:
You'll be fine!
Twilight:
I will not!
(hydra roars)
Pinkie Pie:
I-i-i-t's your only ho-o-o-o-pe!
(hydra snarls) Pinkie Pie:
You have to take a leap of faith!
(Twilight gulps)
(hydra snarls)
(crash) (Twilight yelps)
No!
Oh no!
NOOOOOO!
(bubble pops) (Twilight screams) (Twilight grunts repeatedly)
(Twilight shakes off confusion) (ponies cheer) Pinkie Pie:
"I knew you could do it, Twilight!"
Twilight:
"I don't know how it happened; coincidence, dumb luck, or what, but you said there'd be a doozy here at Froggy Bottom Bog, and  I'd say we just had ourselves one heck of a doozy."
"I mean, that hydra- (theremin music, Pinkie Pie shudders)"
Twilight:
Pinkie?
Pinkie Pie:
That wasn't it.
Twilight:
Huh?
Spike:
What wasn't what?
Fire!
"Fire!"""
"Kinda defeats the purpose, right?"
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Fuck!
"I didn't say ""Fire!"", I said ""Fuck!"""
Fuck!
Fuck-fire!
Fuck!
Fuck!
Ass!
You can say anything.
Shit!
Bitch!
Cunt!
Fuck!
Fart!
Fuck!
"Wow, I just shot down a duck by saying ""Fuck!"""
Next is the Roll &amp;amp; Rocker.
This thing is the biggest shit-biscuit I've ever seen.
"You stand on it, and supposedly, you rock back and forth, which controls the D-pad."
The modern-day equivalent would be the Wii Fit.
"The Roll &amp;amp; Rocker is supposed to be compatible with every game for the NES, but I find that it isn't compatible with any of 'em."
"Each game responds differently, but none of them work."
"Adventure Island keeps walking right,"
"Excitebike keeps going down,"
"Skate or Die goes in circles,"
"Kung Fu ducks to the right,"
"Metal Gear does nothing at all,"
Water of Ganges.
"- Yes, yes."
"Oh, give me some."
Why is it so bitter?
Because the Ganges is polluted.
Oh!
"- Yes. "" Hare Rama; Hare Krishna. """
""" Krishna; Krishna; Hare; Hare. """
""" Hare Rama; Hare Krishna. """

Apologise.
They were fasting.
Hello.
- We were fasting.
And you gave us alcohol.
Alcohol is permitted in fasts.
It's made from sugarcane.
"It fills you with energy, and makes you lightheaded."
- Rascal.
Keep the phone down.
- You'll never learn.
Abusing in the month of 'Shravan' (pious month).
See.
Truth sounds bitter than liquor.
There's a limit to cracking jokes.
"Papa, please."
"What you did yesterday, is a sin in mummy's view."
And mummy's fasting today to repent for it.
I want to know.
How can she repent for my sins by fasting?
"Sushila, it's like your phone's on charging.. ..and my battery's getting charged."
ls it Wi-fi?
(Interrupts) Inconclusive!
Your results are inconclusive at best.
"No, you'll have plenty of time for measurements when you're down in the tunnel tonight."
Dr. Niven:
"Director, we have to stop the LHC until we assess the danger."
DG:
No Dr. Niven.
Once we have fixed this problem the LHC will run again as usual.
DG:
Finding the Higgs is the highest priority.
Amy:
Why is Dr. Niven going into the tunnels?
James:
Why do you think the Director General's here?
Matt:
Maybe they made a black hole...
Lisa:
(Very quiet) Sorry.
Amy:
Hey.
Lisa:
Hey.
Lisa:
"So, did you recover from last night?"
Lisa:
Mmmhmm.
Amy: ...Yeah.
You too?
Amy:
"Wait, aren't you supposed to be on your way to Barcelona by now?"
Lisa:
I might have missed my flight...
21 young boys across the world have come to take part.
And thousands of young boys and girls have come to see them.
"They look, enthusiastic, energized and motivated."
And this cross country race is going to be...
Mr. Shreekant!
- Mr. Bharat!
"Hello, uncle."
"- Bless you, son."
- How are you?
Where's Damodar?
- Delhi.
Crowd is cheering them.
And last years Hongkong race's winner
"Mr. Bharat, if my son-in-law Jimmy would win... ...I'll throw a grand party."
If my son Jaikishan would win I'll throw a grand party.
Hail Rajdoot!
"Mr. Bharat, my jimmy has Honda."
So what?
Only my son will win.
The race opens today... 1... 2... 3... 4...
Is ahead...
He's ahead of everyone and number 9 is trying to chase.
Jimmy!
"- C'mon, Rajdoot!"
Jaikishan with Rajdoot on number 9...
Number 16 has crossed number 9.
Number 16 is Jimmy Thapa.
And jimmy Thapa is moving ahead and he's ahead...
Number 9 is exactly in line with number 16.
Number 9 is moving ahead now.
And he has gone much ahead.
Number 9 has left Jimmy Thapa behind.
It was a wonderful experiment until we burned the church down.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Fair enough.
OK.
Let's talk about collaboration.
"If you could work with anyone in the biz, who would it be?"
TlLDA SWlNTON:
I would love to work with Tina Fey.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Really?
Wow.
"Are you a fan of ""30 Rocks?"""
TlLDA SWlNTON:
Tina Fay is an ice flow in the north Atlantic that I astral project to every third Sunday in Ramadan.
I sit on the ice.
On my bottom.
In my mind.
And let the fear of a dying world snake its way up my vagina.
Through my pelvis.
To create a crystal of ecstasy.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Wow.
"Well, thank you so much for joining us today, Tilda."
TlLDA SWlNTON:
"You're very welcome, Julie."
I'm ready to begin the interview whenever you are.
BETH HOYT:
Wow.
I thought that went great.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Yeah.
BETH HOYT:
Hey...
Hit anywhere.
Nothing happens.
My God!
"- Sorry, Mr. Jimmy."
Your car's metal was no doubt from foreign.
"But I'm sorry, the hand was Indian."
That's why your car got injured.
Thank you for bringing Radha here.
Now it's upto Radha.
She can hop in any vehicle she wants.
"Come, darling."
"- Stop, Kishan!"
- Car is waiting for you.
"Bye, Jimmy!"
"Call me in the morning, okay?"
Thank you.
Rogue!
"If your intentions are pure, even the God supports you."
Good morning sir.
This morning is really very good.
"Why, sir?"
There's good news for you.
Good news?
- Yes.
There's going to be a motorcycle race from Mumbai to Poona.
Many big models of motorcycle are coming to take part.
Our company has selected you to take part... ...in the competition with Rajdoot 350.
Wow!
"- Really, sir?"
Do you had to interrupt?
First prize is worth Rs50000.
[whimsical music]
man:
Whoo!
[boy crying]
[cheers and applause]
[helicopter whirring]
[laughter]
man:
Do the jerk.
Please do the jerk.
"By the end, I'm gonna try to get the commander to do the jerk. man #2:"
Aah! man:
Why you always got to stick your tongue out?
Punch Eason in the face right now. man #3:
"Oh, my God! man:"
That's the Rebel Alliance.
And there's the Empire.
Masood:
Hi.
This is my room.
And this is our garden.
So my name is Masood...
"I live in Afghanistan, Kabul, and I'm a news photographer."
Here is my house.
"And he's my father, drinking tea."
My mother is praying.
"Farid, my brother, is just-- again is staring in the refrigerator, as always."
"Right now I'm in my car, going to Kabul's old city, to take some pictures."
Sometimes I like to just walk around there
looking for a good shot.
These are like my two babies.
I carry them everywhere.
"Diallo ""Torpedo:"" Oh yeah."
Give me some love.
"Give me some love, dude."
Teenager #15:
Whoo!
Teenager #16:
"Keep it up, keep it up."
There we go.
Teenager #17:
Whoo!
Here comes Paul!
"Diallo ""Torpedo:"""
"Come on, Paul."
Paul:
"I know I've lost, but you know?"
I don't really feel that bad.
I feel pretty good about actually finishing.
NARRATOR:
"Paul, congratulations on making it back, man."
How has this whole experience been for you?
Paul:
I wouldn't trade it for the world.
"I mean, these guys are Eagles, and they're the best ones in the country."
And they've certainly proved it today.
You showed your true colors.
"Starting with ""Big South."""
With him trying to help me with the shooting.
I got to the tower.
You guys were cheering me on.
"When I got here, you guys were cheering me on."
You showed yourself true Scouts.
"Diallo ""Torpedo:"" Paul, we know this has been hard."
And that's fine.
I understand that.
Bobby:
Dad's fault.
Cathy:
"If it's because you're scared to go upstairs by yourself or downstairs by yourself, just tell me that."
Bobby:
I will.
Sometimes... [speaking indistinctly]
And stop videotaping!
Cathy:
Bobby... man:
I was gonna give you a camera too.
Cathy:
"We're gonna do a project-- a family project, okay?"
Can we all agree to do the family project?
"If not, then we can't do it. man:"
Do you want a camera?
Cathy:
Okay?
Bobby:
What? man:
Do you want a camera to videotape me?
Bobby:
Mm-hmm.
Cathy:
It's gonna be a family project.
"I need to have a happy boy today, okay? man:"
You have to be happy if you have the video camera.
Bobby:
Why? man:
Because it's a happy film.
What are you doing?
BETH HOYT:
I am demonstrating some different ways to sit.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
I love sitting.
BETH HOYT:
Oh my gosh.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
I have a way to sit.
BETH HOYT:
Great.
Julie Klausner is adding to the more ways to sit on chairs.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"So this is a cool way to sit on a chair if you have like, a classroom full of students."
"And you want to maybe like, learn from their life lessons."
BETH HOYT:
Oh my gosh.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"You kind of lean over the front of the chair, and you--"
BETH HOYT:
This is assertive.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
Want to-- it's both.
It's submissive and assertive.
BETH HOYT:
I see what you're saying.
Because you're putting up a barrier.
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"Yeah, exactly."
But you're also open.
"So you lean into it, and then I like to steeple my fingers at first, and rest my chin on my thumbs."
And then just nod until I unsteep-- steepling.
Where's he now?
Guess he's gone back home with Xiang Yaocha
Who's Xiang Yaocha?
Mu Wanqing.
Mu Wanqing?
Tuan Zhengchun &amp;amp; Qin Hongmian's bastard child!
She's his daughter.
What's the story?
"Qin Hongmian tried to avoid being a laughingstock, by changing her daughter's name to Mu."
Xiang Yaocha as alias.
Who would have guessed that her daughter... has found Tuan Zhengchun's son?
"I was there, when Mu Wanqing... promised herself to Tuan Yu."
Really?
That's good news.
"In other words,"
I'll be using those two... to get even with Tuan Zhengchun.
"Hurry, follow me to Wanjie valley."
Not going after Tuan Yu?
Of course we will.
"But first, we need to solicit help... of the Chief of Wanjie valley."
I get it.
I heard that Chief Zhong's wife had... an affair with Tuan Zhengchun once.
He bears a bitter hatred for Tuan Zhengchun.
"And because of that,"
I'm sure he'll be more than happy to help.
We shouldn't waste any more time.
We'll leave right away.
My father.
Are you well?
Well?
I'm almost halfdead being mad at you!
"Father, this is Miss Mu."
Sam!
Look out!
Dad!
No!
Ow!
Your arm's broken.
Ow!
"You scared me, man."
How long have I been out?
Just a few minutes.
Where's Mai Jad?
They took her up to the bridge.
Hold still.
Where'd you learn how to do that?
I don't know.
Just kinda made sense.
Ah.
I should've listened to you.
"Going after Chung was stupid, and..."
"Hey, we all make mistakes."
"Yeah, some mistake!"
Look at the fix I got us into.
You gotta learn to be more optimistic.
Look at all the options.
testing testing one two there
Testing testing one two three
Testing testing one two three welcome to the introduction of this course and blasa blas blas and let me give you a little about my personal testimony and how i got here blasa blasa blasa
SPEAKER 1:
I don't go out after a certain hour of the night like during a weekday.
SPEAKER 2:
I generally don't go out at night by myself.
Dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah! man:
"Bobby, get down."
We're gonna let Mommy sleep.
Bobby:
Son of a cuss.
Cathy:
Thank you.
Thank you.
"Um, I do have a question, though,"
"'cause I--my biggest worry is, you know, of course, my bandages and stuff."
But I've been taking a sh--
"I know I can take a shower, but I haven't."
But I thought maybe I could at least try to take a shower before you got here.
Is that okay if I just go ahead and do that?
"Oh, good."
Okay.
Bobby:
"Dad, can I come down?"
Cathy:
"Bobby, can we have a talk, though?"
"Please, please, please?"
Bobby:
Oh.
Cathy:
"I just need to have a talk, okay?"
"Because Grandma is telling me-- all the grandmas, all the friends are saying what a great boy you are."
And of course I know that.
And I know that it's hard.
I've never been in a hospital.
I've never been like this before.
"I just need us all to help each other, okay?"
"And I know that sometimes when we ask you to do something to help, sometimes it's 'cause you don't want to go upstairs 'cause you get scared."
Judging from that Yello Robe fellow's expressions... he must have wicked plans for Wanqing &amp;amp; Master Tuan.
No
I must try to inform the Tuan family first.
"Go, little snake."
Go to Dali Palace.
A snake!
What's going on?
Snake... there's a snake!
"Your Highness, it's the gold snake from Wanjie valley."
It must be a message from the Chief.
"""Master Tuan is in the Stonechamber"""
The Tuan family Chief is here.
Please.
Long time no see.
Have a seat.
You cut off my legs with your Yi Yang Finger then;
Your children can pay for your debt today.
Where have you imprisoned them?
In the stone chamber;
About to be food for the gorilla.
"Zhengchun, don't worry."
I believe Tuan Yu is good enough ...to take on the beast.
Wait and see then.
Shameless old thief.
Tuan Yu.
"Quick, eat up the toad."
You've sucked up the Red Python's blood;
"And after you've eaten the toad, ...you will be invincible."
We have to get out!
"C'mon, eat it!"
Hurry.
"Tuan Yu, now you have acquired super power."
They're Granddad's teeth.
Granddad's teeth.
"So, the sex gods are twins."
- C'est magnifique.
- Marvy.
- But they're not identical.
"- Obviously, Jas."
They're two years above us.
Jackie's got Geography with the one called Tom.
She says he just moved here from London.
London!
I knew they were cosmopolitan.
Apparently their family just opened an organic shop on the high street.
Dishy and nutritious.
"So, G, Tom or Robbie?"
Which brother do you want?
- What about me?
"- El, we saw them first."
That's not fair!
"Ellen, you have to be emotionally sorted to be ready for a boyfriend."
Jas and I are there.
We even devised a snogging scale.
That proves it.
"We have to know ourselves, to see how boys see us."
Can you handle that?
"Okay, so it's time for the Physical Attractiveness Test."
Finished.
You lot are so sweet.
I got mostly eights for everything.
"- So did I. - Me, too."
"Hey, who gave me a four for my nose?"
And look.
- May God give you more.
Afiyet olsun.
"Mehmet, where's our tea?"
"Just kidding, sit down."
Eat your food.
It's Memo's day today.
"Eat all you can, Memo."
That's what I call a börek... ... health be upon your mother's hands.
Eat from that çörek as well.
It's the çörek my dad sells the most.
- I already ate 3 of those.
- Whoa!
"Mmm, this one is delicious as well."
This doesn't look like bakery material tho.
Where is this from?
From a certain çirkin.
"Guys, your letters."
"Good news, we got our letters"
- Rıza.
- Thanks babacan.
- Kuzey Tekinoğlu.
- It's me.
You got a letter from the whole alphabet.
"""Hello Kuzey,"""
"""As I think about the things happened since our last meeting in the bakery..."""
"""..."
"I wish I could rewind the time and say goodbye in better terms."""
"""Maybe now is time to push our anger aside."
"What do you say?"""
"""I talked with your lawyer."""
"""I told him, I could be your witness if it is seen necessary."""
"""He said Barış's statement is the important one."""
*I never go anywhere* *without my money.*
I've got more money than money can buy.
It's the best thing in the world besides my Porsche.
"Bruce, you were great today."
Those jokes running under your editorial were a howl.
"Uh, jokes?"
Don't be so modest.
Money's the name of your gerbil?
That's funny stuff.

That's not a boyfriend.
That's a Boy Scout.
News show?
"What's the scoop, Mr. Collins?"
The school's installing a new in-class video system.
"As of next week, Oracle goes broadcast."
Cool.
Lame.
What a great opportunity.

Hello.
Can I help you?
You already have.
Russ Franklin.
I'm the video consultant for the news show.
"Oh, you're working on this?"
Mm-hmm.
"Jessica Wakefield,"
Sweet Valley's next news anchor.
Mind if I check out some of your... equipment?
"Film major at Valley College, huh?"
Creative men really turn me on.
Must be a really tough program.
"Yeah, it's... murder."
We have to watch five movies a day.
They actually expect us to pay attention.
Brutal.
This is the nerve center of our operation.
From here I can hook in and put your face in every classroom in the school.
Really?
Jana:
Our...
"Ju: with ""It Rains""."
Ju:
"Guys, since I listened to this song for the first time, I fell in love with him."
"I love his voice, the voice that doesn't belong to that 19 years old body!"
It's perfect!
"I like ""Wild and Young ""too, but every time I listen to this one..."
"""Wild and Young"" is good, but there is something especial about ""It Rains""."
Ju:
4th Place is Exo- Growl!
Ju:
What amazing song!
"Definitely, it is one of the best songs of the year."
I have...
Jana:
Of the year?
Ju:
One of... it's not THE best song.
"The best song for me is still ""Smoky Girl""  Jana:"
And one of Exo's best songs.
Ju:
Third Place F(x)- Rum Pum Pum Pum.
Ju:
"We did a MV Reaction, and I wanted to listen to again to see if I could like this song."
"And that's what happened, I really like it."
"The choreography is weird and cool, the song too."
"The lyrics are weird, it's about the wisdom tooth, and I mean they compare the wisdom tooth to their first love."
I thought that the lyrics were so crazy that that's why I liked Rum Pum Pum Pum.
So 2nd Place... my divas!
My band!
My Band!
I -- wait -- 44875 -- did you leave out the number 6?
"Same as she did, OK."
You've got a seven-digit number -- call out any six of them loud and clear.
Volunteer:
"0, 7, 9, 0, 4, 4."
I think you left out the number 3?
AB:
That's three.
"The odds of me getting all four of these right by random guessing would be one in 10,000:"
10 to the fourth power.
"OK, any six of them."
(Laughter)
"Really scramble them up this time, please."
Volunteer:
"2, 6, 3, 9, 7, 2."
Did you leave out the number 7?
And let's give all four of these people a nice round of applause.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
(Applause ends)
"For my next number -- (Laughter) while I mentally recharge my batteries,"
I have one more question for the audience.
"By any chance, does anybody here happen to know the day of the week that they were born on?"
"If you think you know your birth day, raise your hand."
"Let's see, starting with -- let's start with a gentleman first."
"What year was it, first of all?"
That's why I pick a gentleman first.
Audience:
1953.
"1953, and the month?"
November what?
23rd -- was that a Monday?
Take him to the hospital.
He being bit by a stroke!
Pay your debt first!
Give me the money!
He is dying and you're still thinking about your money?
It's only his nose to big deal!
The stroke is going to kill him.
Let me call the ambulance for you.
"Ping, get me the phone."
Anything wrong with your nose?
Is it the police or the hospital?
"Just the same, anyway."
I've got some loan shark here bleeding.
Please come quickly.
It's alright now!
He's managed to stop the bleeding.
Thanks.
Mom was right in saying that everything is predestined.
"Ever since Sylvester picked up those two letters, ...bad things take place one after the other."
Weird things that no one can explain!
They just happen...
Click!
Just like that.
Sylvester
"Moon, it's your pager."
"I've dehited $3,000 into your account."
"""The news-vendor kid called."
Sylvester's being hitting.
Come!
Hurry!
Look!
I don't live here!
Why did you drink so much?
Come to your senses!
Good job.
Go on your way.
Aren't you going to give me some...?
- Give him something and send him away.
- Yes.
Come to your senses!
In Hyung!
In Hyung!
"Your Excellency, you're home."
He must have had an event at work.
These events are important to one's career.
The police have been busy all day due to the explosions at the harbor.
"- Father, you're home!"
- In Hyung! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Father!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
- Take him to his room.
"- Yes, Sir. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;In Hyung, wake up!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Take care of the body.
It was him that night!
Gil Dong...!
Let me go with you.
I didn't tell Yi Nok about him.
I said that it was not my duty to reveal to her what he himself hid.
But that was just an excuse.
"But the truth is that I know that if she sees him, I will lose her."
That's why I couldn't tell her.
I must have fallen asleep.
Did the chief leave already?
I must have dreamt about Gil Dong again.
He was sitting right here.
It's still warm.
Some illness it's hard to put your finger on.
It's now every night!
"I know he's not working, I know he's not"
She thinks I'm driving you away.
She's a child!
How do you kill someone with voodoo?
"I put his hair inside the wax coffin, buried it in the graveyard."
That's ridiculous!
You wanna raise the dead?
But you can't kill people with voodoo. sometimes a soldier falls on his own sword.
You speak to my wife again and I will kill you.
Oh my god!
No!
Daddy!
Bad girl
I failed him. no!
"Milk, water, and dates"
"Allah akbar Allah Akbar, I can't hear pass them water"

Echo of voices ...
Sounds of birds calling...

La verga (look it up in a spanish/english dictionary)
So thank you for that.
"We can take one or two questions, but remembering we've got the forum."
Any questions?
We'll save it 'til then.
Great.
"- Esra, I've heard you're replacing Luciel  by taking care of Mrs. van de Berg."
- Yeah.
- I know some of you don't think it's such a good idea  but this is what Sander and I decided.
"I promise you, I won't be in your way."
- Hidde is doing well.
"Corien, thank you for acting  so determinedly."
It was hardly a pleasant situation.
"Let's see, to wrap things up..."
"Oemaima, you're off to see Esmee and her baby."
Please don't start any arguments this time.
- I don't start arguments.
- Oh well great.
Then I'm done nagging.
Get to work everybody.
- Wait.
Wait.
No motto for today?
- Yeah of course.
"Take care of other, but mostly of yourself."
- Ah beautiful!
Hi everybody!
Welcome to CS 215.
"My name is Micheal Littman, and I'm going to be your instructor."
Let's get off with a little magic trick.
All right!
Here is a collection of actors from movies.
"This is Bruce Willis, Danny Devito, Cloris Leachman, Stanley Tucci,"
Cause I feel inner peace when I'm out of my mind
"And you can call me crazy, but I like to roll the dice"
So I'm willing to bet that I'mma be crazy for the rest of my life
[dramatic music playing]
-(reporter) The carnage continues today as yet another body was found.
This will be the tenth victim of the mysterious Kool-Aid Killer.
"-(announcer) For years, he's waited in the shadows, forgotten."
-There's a madman loose and he's killing people.
-This is his calling card.
-He feels forgotten and he's sending a message by killing everyone that doesn't drink Kool-Aid.
-So he's basically killing everyone above the age of five.
-I hate my life.
[crash!]
-Oh yeah!
-(announcer) This summer... get ready... the rivers are gonna run red.

"What has happened, Kishan?"
What has happened?
"Will he survive, Mr. Shashtri?"
Doctor said the next 24 hours are critical.
No!
"- Child, I'm a manager of this guest house cum temple."
I've witnessed any tough wishes getting fulfilled.
If your love is true... ...Goddess will have to favour you.
This is a true lover's oath to the Goddess... ...until my Kishan regains conscience... ...I'll not wear these bangles.
But my child. how did this happen?
He's a police officer.
Goons killed tow of our men.
And we've no clue about the rest of the four.
Wonder where they would be.
You very well know where Jackie is.
Where's Jackie?
Where's Jackie?
Tell us Jackie's whereabouts and we'll release you.
Tell us.
Tell us where's Jackie?
Radha!
Kishan!
Kishan!
"Goddess heard my prayer, Kishan!"
You are alright.
You are alright.
You are alright.
"At least now drink some water, my child."
"Thank you, Goddess."
"Sir, Jackie's two men are killed."
And four are jailed.
"Still, you couldn't bring my daughter."
I can't control it

I didn't know we had so much fans
A lot of you came
We are back with our  2nd regular album after a year
You know that we don't have any ballad songs
There is one ballad song  in this album
We have an amazing  song
For that song...
She wrote the lyrics  of that song
We have that song.
Which one is it?
Correct answer
This is the improved version of flamingo.
If you insert money here...
-How is it?
Do you want a glass?
-I'm all right.
I got rid of three lions today.
"Wow, I caught a leopard and two hippos."
"Everything you need for safari, from guns to clothes, you can borrow here."
There are different classes; Class A gets a jeep and two assistant robots.
"Class B only gets a jeep, and Class C gets one assistant robot."
This is just beyond my imagination.
"Thank you for inviting, but I'm leaving now."
"Wait, I called you because I wanted to ask you a favor."
Please come here.
Hey!
Wait!
Where are you going?
I see.
He thinks I'm his mom.
Watch out!
"One, two, three."
This was a robot as well.
Hey!
Come out now.
It's not scary anymore.
"Look, bad snakes are..."
Hold on!
I can't leave you alone since it's so dangerous around here.
"We robots are also friends with animals, as well as with humans."
All right.
"Since it's hard to call you, I'm going to name you Pura."
Pura.
-What's happenin' guys?
Yo!
Do people still say yo?
Can I say yo?
"Well, I'm sayin' it."
Yo!
Dawg!
Check out this awesome attempt at this assisted backflip.
"-One, two, three... [groaning]"
-Fayul!
That's my new thing.
Fayul!
That's not my new thing.
But this attempted flip was a fail.
"Now, the original video was relatively hidden, but I guess the guy submitted it to FailBlog and now it has over a million views."
But most of the comedy comes from the poor dude here who gets kicked in the head and then busts his face on the fire extinguisher.
[crash!]
Did you hear that sound?
It sounded like a f--king car wreck.
[laughter]
And then you got the friend over here who literally ROFLs.
"That ROFL would make an amazing GlF, wouldn't it?"
"-Rahahaha, rahahaha..."
"-All right, that's it."
I'm done with that video.
Yo.
"Sometimes, you know, your friend gets herself stuck in the dryer."
"And it's cool, you know, it happens to the best of us."
-Whoo!
"-Come on, get out!"
-I can't!
[laughter]
You're not tougher than a Boy Scout.
You have to go home.
Lee:
"Thank you, gentlemen."
I appreciate it.
I'm heartbroken... right now.
"Keegan ""Yeti:"" You did great."
Lee:
My wife gave me one bit of advice before she left.
"It was, ""Keep your head."
Don't freak out.
"Keep your head and you'll win."""
I kept my head for two days.
"The last challenge, I failed myself by not thinking all the way through."
I just feel like I let my kids and everybody down.
"Michael ""Hitch:"" Lee owned up to his mistake."
"If I was his kid, I'd be proud of him."
Lee:
Phew.
"Hey, Paul."
"Good luck, man."
Paul:
"Thanks, Lee."
So I'm the last man standing.
That feels pretty good.
"And I'm, I'm ready."
I'm ready for the next stage.
NARRATOR:
"Scouts, welcome to the final challenge."
"Paul, you're going head-to-head against Will, Rob, and Rio... ...in one final challenge that consists of three different events."
"We're incorporating Scouting skills that require concentration, endurance, and your smarts."
"This is the Toyota ""Iron Scout"" Challenge."
"Today on the bases of this truth, I've dared... ...to come and ask for your daughter's hand in marriage."
Do you know the punishment of stepping in this house?
"I've gone through many punishments, father."
And I'm ready to go through any punishment.
Then watch my last punishment.
Brother!
- No!
What are you doing?
"Stop, Jamna!"
Stop there everyone!
"No, uncle!"
Don't do that.
Think of your daughter and your prestige.
He's that goon who has brought shame to my prestige.
He snatched away my daughter from me.
I'll not spare him.
"Yes, he has snatched away your daughter."
He has...
Shoot him.
Kill him...
"But remember, first you'll have to kill your own daughter."
Radha!
Radha!
Radha is Kishan's flute.
No one could separate it.
She'll live and die with him.
What are you doing?
At least think about me.
Lowly!
Your father arrested so many criminals.
And you want him to be a criminal today?
God!
I did this cool collab video with my boy Dave Storm.
Bam!
Go and check it out.
It's freakin' awesome.
He has an awesome idea for a channel.
He takes suggestions from the audience and makes songs out of them.
It's really cool; he's a really talented guy.
"So anyway, go check out the video."
"If you like his stuff, be sure to subscribe and I will see you guys after Thanksgiving."
"So tell me guys, what would you do?"

She looks at me every day.
Mary Jane Watson.
"Oh, boy."
If she only knew how I felt about her.
But she can never know.
I made a choice once to live a life of responsibility.
A life she can never be a part of.
Who am I?
"I'm Spider-Man, given a job to do."
"And I'm Peter Parker, and I, too, have a job."
Parker.
Parker!
"No, no, no, stop!"
Stop!
"Parker, you're late, man."
Always late.
"I'm sorry, Mr. Aziz."
Different.
I think he grew up fast.
"Forcedly.... - He is more mature, but he is a good person."
He tries to look harsh but in order not to be hurt... it's obvious he is the only one who is not aware...
"Yaman is a tender kid, he is merciful, he is a real man.."
"Mira, what happened , Mira, what is wrong my girl?"
"We lost hopes with you- I am not late, take it, there are exactly 1000 TL here, count it!"
Is it OK?
"Kenan's issue will be solved, right?"
Hopefully!
"Brother , what time is it?"
- Half past two.
"Brother, can I use your phone shortly."
I have to make an urgent call.
I will pay for it.
But don't let it be so long!
"- OK, give it."
"Hello?&amp;gt; Hello Mert, it's me ,Yaman."
"Hello Yaman, where are you man?"
Half an hour is left for the exam.
"I am dying from worry.-I am on my way, I am coming, I will catch it, don't worry!"
"OK, were you by Mira's side too?"
What happened to Mira?
- Okay... okay... see you!
Mert i'm saying what happened to Mira?
Yaman! &amp;gt; Where's Mira?
Inside.
Her parents are with her.
"What happened, what does she have?- I don't know, they said they would take her for operation but..."
"Why are you here mom, what's happening?"
"Sude, calm down.- Oh my God!"
Again everything comes from you.
"Climb, if I want, without all the shouting."
"I just want to know that I feel strong, you know."
"And clouds really should be white at least, and oceans should meet us at the beach, and I don't want to overreach when I know what's in store, raw love."
"Life, a day at a time, my love."
"Life, a day at a time, don't know."
Love.
Life in a day and life in a day and life in a day...
I want to drink from the clearest water.
I want to eat the things I ought to.
"I just want to know that I feel strong, you know."
"I want to reach the greatest mountain, climb, if I want, without all the shouting."
"I just want to know that I feel strong, you know."
"And clouds really should be white at least, and oceans should meet us at the beach, and I don't want to overreach when I know what's in store, raw love."

"So there is no chaos tomorrow, we'll divide the square into sectors."

Slogan chanting can be done by the support staff.
"Let me see, where were you?"
Mert whispering: is that Mira?
Hello?&amp;gt;Just a second..
I will go so you can talk comfortably.
Your voice sounds interrupted...
Last night was left half.
"In fact we have to complete it. want to talk with you a bit tonight, but alone."
Okay?
Don't take Mert with you.
Only you and me.
"Look, girl!"
"I am telling you the last time clearly, I don't have anything to do with you and will never in this life."
"Did you understand it?-Ah..ah...-Ah or not, this is it!"
You will have nothing from me!
I'm telling you this from the beginning.
Do you understand me?
"Hey, talk properly !"
You're the girl that my friend loves.
"Be wise, be worthy of him!"
I am trying to explain it politely but...
"look Eylul, if you sadden that boy, I will break your heart, know this too!"
OK?
Did you get me?
You're out of your mind!- Whatever it is!
"Don't call me again, ok?"
"Or even say ""Hello"" as a human... or don't even greet me."
That's it!
Mert?!
I forgot my phone.
There is a girl at our place...
Err...
Giray's girlfriend... stupid... she calls me constantly..

Shut up!
I may say it now even when I'm not drunk
We've been dating for 7 years.
We kissed and caressed
I don't wanna write all those extra essays they make you do.
"I mean, how am I supposed to know what my ""most emotionally significant moment"" was ?"
"So when my ""U"" of ""M"" acceptance came in December, I just said the hell with it."
- Onions ?
- What ?
"You, uh, want onions ?"
"Oh, no, thank you."
So what are you gonna major in ?
"State's got a good business school, and I could probably walk-on to the lacrosse team."
"Well, you've probably got it pretty figured out, then, huh ?"
"I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but... what am I gonna be, a professional lacrosse player ?"
I really have no idea.
Thank God.
I thought I was the only one.
"Well, you're not."
So we're gonna be close next year.
You mean East Lansing and Ann Arbor ?
Yeah.
[ Chuckling ]
[ Stifler ]
What are you talkin' about ?
I can't go to the prom with you.
I'm holding out for someone else.
[ Laughing ]
You gotta be fuckin' kidding me.
"I know it's a long shot, but I figure Paul Finch might ask me."
Finch.
Shit-brick.
"Oh, gosh."
I-I forgot.
[ Stammering ]
You look okay.
This is how brynza cheese is made.

Ferhat's daughter.
He wanted to make the guy stay away from his daughter.
- Did the boy harm his daughter or something?
- No.
It's just jealousy.
He wanted to give him a scare.
You know.
- Hello Aziz.
- How can I help you commissary?
"Ferhat's daughter, Dennis Norton."
Check if she entered the country lately.
It can be under either Dennis Norton or Deniz Çoşkun name.
"English passport or Turkish passport, okay?"
- I'll check the last three months.
"- Okay, let me know."
"- Hello, Demet."
- I've just seen your message.
I was suffering in wonder why she didn't reply to my message.
"It said ""call me"" in your message."
What happened?
"What do you mean ""what happened""?"
We didn't see each other in days.
I want to see you.
"Even if it's for only 5 minutes, please."
"Give me some time, please."
I don't feel okay with this.
"I know, I feel uneasy too."
But I miss you.
This can't go on when Kuzey is this much opposed to it.
We can't do it without his consent.
What consent are you talking about?
"Each passing day, his barks are getting thicker."
"Alright, woohoo!"
"Go, Rarity!"
Rarity?
You okay in there?
You haven't come out for days.
I'm never coming out!
I can't show my face in Ponyville ever again!
I used to be somepony.
I used to be respected.
I made dresses.
"Beautiful, beautiful dresses!"
But now everypony is laughing at me.
I'm nothing but a laughingstock!
"You're not a laughingstock, Rarity..."
-She kind of is.
-Shhh!
Come on out and talk to us.
Leave me alone!
I vant to be alone!
I want to wallow in... ...whatever it is that ponies are supposed to wallow in!
Do ponies wallow in pity?
"Oh, listen to me, I don't even know what I'm supposed to wallow in!"
I'M SO PATHETlC!
Now what do we do?
Panic?
That's your answer for everything!
"Well, we can't just leave Rarity like this."
She'll become a crazy cat lady!
She only has one cat.
Give her time.
Exile...
I guess technically I'd have to move away to live in exile.
He's dating Carla.
This's not good.
"First of all, I already told her I got a girlfriend."
"Second, you just put your bare lips on my ear."
How is it going?
I'm....
"JD, I know. he won't stop talking about you."
I'm Jennifer.
"Mmm, Jennifer."
Do you really spend everyday saving children lives?
Tell the nice lady.
I do what I can.
I know two things to be true about bars.
"One they are always packed the week of thanksgiving,"
"And two, put a beer in my hand and I'm Mr. Smooth"
"I was laughing so hard, milk was coming of my nose."
I was tripped over IV and blood shot over everyone
A little got on my nose.
Every damn day saving those children.
Who wants margaritas?
"Dube, less blood, more fruity drinks."
Right.
That's the thing about Turk.
He hasn't changed a bit since college.
He's still the same goofball who tells me how to be cooler.
"Dude, this girl's pretty hot."
"So try not to blow it,okay?"
Why do you say that?
"Because you're like a 24 convenient store , you never close."
That sounds a Fat Albert like joke
Don't worry about it man.
"I feel good tonight, you know what I'm saying."
It's going to be about German industry norms.
"I wish you good luck, I hope it's going to be perfect!"
The following incident is a reenactment.
Professional actors will depict different characters in each episode.
That was a mistake!
Nobody checks the handicapped sticker.
"Mom, we're just not comfortable with it."
"Yeah, and it's a really expensive ticket, by the way."
"Well, I got a bum knee and a broken vagina."
Ticket that!

MOTHER'S DAY
"Good afternoon, welcome to the El Fuerte..."
What's good about it?
Sorry!
It was a long drive.
Ha ha ha!
"Um, we have our registration."
You got room in the trash for Mama?
Unless you want my crust.
"Trust me, you don't want that."
My sister and I are on the list.
"And, um, we have our mom with us today."
Does she have a reservation with us?
I have a reservation about your haircut.
It should be under Turner.
P F-ing U!
Either something died in this...
"Ma, I'll put you back in the car so fast."
Oh G-d!
Tonight I am hanging out with Emily. woman:
Okay. man:
But I was planning on telling her exactly how I feel about her.
And then I don't know.
So I was calling my mother to see-- what should I say to this woman?
[woman laughing]
Okay.
I don't know.
"I just think that, you know-- just concentrate on the fact that, you know, you have very, very high feelings of esteem for her, that she's somebody that you've always admired. man:"
"""Esteem""?"
Is that the word I should use?
Esteem?
You think she'd like that? woman:
Yeah.
Whatever. man:
I just don't know if that's-- woman:
You hold her in very high regard. man:
Ok--I don't know if those-- woman:
She's a special person in your life. man:
Okay.
I'll try all that.
Hey.
I am on the train now.
This is my friend Emily.
[romantic music]
"Uh, hello, ""Life In A Day."""
"I'm still with Emily, and we're still hanging out in Chicago."
"Um, this is..."
"We--we just came out of this place, which was cool."
"But, uh, I'm gonna leave this thing on in case anything gets climactic."
man:
"Theresa, look at me."
Welcome to Tea Time.

My ...
BlRTHDAY!
YAY!
Today is my Birthday!
I am so excited you're here to celebrate with me!
I have a very good idea.
Would you like to do a special birthday dance with me today?
You would?
I would be so excited.
Thank you!
"First, I have to put on my special birthday tiara!"
Great!
"And secondly, I'm going to teach you the birthday dance moves."
"First, we're going to take our hands and we're going to put them on our knees."
And we're all going to bounce like this ...
Bounce ... bounce ... bounce ... bounce
That's good!
"Next, we're going to take our hands and put them right here by our face."
Cheese.
And you're going to wave from side to side like this ...
Good job everybody!
And for our last dance move we're going to turn in a circle.
Can you turn in a circle without getting dizzy and falling down?
I bet you can!
Let's try it.
"The thief shouldn""t escape. stay awake."
I saw.. and along with that inflation.
It affects each and everyone.
"Don""t cry."
Because of this..
"Because of this, l never got married."
I never got married. keep a close watch. stay awake.
"The thief shouldn""t escape. stay awake."
"Hey, mister."
Whenever you will become the minister.
"Hey, mister."
Whenever you will become the minister. keep a close watch. stay awake.
You are asleep.
And the enemy is alert.
Wake up. otherwise you will be in trouble.
Hey!
That country will be robbed.
"That country will be robbed, where the guards go to sleep."
Where the guards go to sleep.
The green signal has been given.
Jamal Pasha has the goods.
Leave immediately.
31 1 .
3 North.
7.
"lt""s gold worth 5 crores."
- I will leave immediately.
No!
"The goods won""t be delivered through the port."
Already the police are after us. so what?
The police are in our fist!
"Don""t talk nonsense!"
"That was that then,-"
- No!
It is ... another!
Hahahaha!
I am going absolutely crazy.
People were so excited about Grant's new product that he started getting requests
left and right for his glasses wipers and spray nozzles.
"So, he started to keep a"
list of everyone who would want a pair very soon.
"By the end of 1 day, 36 of his friends had begged him for glasses wipers and 11 of those people each said that they would also like a pair of nozzles to go with their glasses wipers."
"It's... the pop... from, uh, the pizza place?"
It's -- looks like a person.
He matches the color of the restaurant.
That is the coffee logo.
That is a parade elephant.
That is the Disney.
Those are... little... worms.
"That looks like an ""M""."
"But upside down, ""M""s are ""W""s!"
That is the Apple Store logo!
It has a bite of an apple in it.
"Ooh, looks like the 'merican flag."
A bell.
"Uh, outside space."
Looks like a shooting star?
With a planet.
An eye.
"Chili, and it has an ""S"" next to it, and chilis are spicy."
That looks like a beach ball.
Beach balls are very colorful.
The GE logo.
That's where my grandpa works.
"Oh, I get it."
"You wanted this anchor job for yourself, and this is your way of getting back at me."
You'd let your own sister go down in flames just to satisfy your petty jealousy.
All right... but this is the last time I bail you out.
You're the greatest.
"Afterwards, I'll tell Collins you wrote the stories."
"He'll see how good you are, he'll let you write all my stories."
Me in front of the camera and you behind.
We could be a team.
"*Good morning, Sweet Valley.* *Today's top story...*"
Jessica.
Have you seen Elizabeth?
Nope.
"Ten minutes, people."
"Jessica, I need to proof your copy."
"Sorry, Mr. C. Liz is still Xeroxing it."
"OK, looks good, Camera One."
"Camera Two, zoom out."
Camera Two?
"Hello, Camera Two?"
"What is that, Manny?"
"Oh, sorry."
"Elizabeth, where have you been?"
I need my stories!
These are blank.
They are?
Silly me.
I must have mixed up the stories I wrote with the ones you wrote.
Is there some kind of irony here?
How can you stand there and pretend you don't know what I'm talking about?
Practice?
"You knew how much I wanted to be anchor, and you switched the tapes just so you could get the job."
There is no beyond.
"Now, it is time to see the sun."
We won't give up our hopes.
We will see beautiful days.
"Narin, how are you sweetheart?"
I talked to the man in the Ministry.
You should have seen how he attended to me...
He will take me to the lunch soon.
Hello?
"Narin, do you hear me?"
This is under the shadow...
Let it see some sun...
Come on...
Mmmm!
Smells so good!
Right out from the oven...
"Who eats gets fat, who doesn't eat becomes sorry..."
"Doctor Bey, since you said you would leave early, I packed yours."
Thank you very much.
Enjoy.
No matter what we have done all this time He only showed some reaction to Narin.
Looks like he recognized her from the picture...
Huh!
"Come, come Duriye..."
You don't have any strength anymore.
Take a sit.
"Mom, are you ok?"
"Duriye Hanim, would you like to have a cold cherry syrup?"
Yes...
"Maybe, it will calm us down a little bit."
There is nothing to do Yasar.
"After all this time, if he only recognized Narin from a picture..."
"Remember, it's all in the presentation!"
"Piece by piece, snip by snip"
"Croup, dock, haunch, shoulders, hip"
"Bolt by bolt, primmed and pressed"
"Yard by yard, always stressed"
And that's the Art of the Dress!
"Oh, Opal."
These are the ugliest dresses I've ever made.
Okay.
I did exactly what each of you asked for.
Now don't hold back.
Let me know what you really think.
-Oh my!
-It's... perfect!
-It's cool!
Wow.
They're the best duds I ever did see.
It's exactly what I asked for!
"Thank you, Rarity."
Are you as happy with the as we're?
"Well, I'm... happy that all of you are happy."
I'm just relieved to finally be done.
You are never gonna believe this!
You've heard of Hoity-Toity?
The bigwig fashion hotshot in Canterlot?
Uh-huh.
He heard about your fashion show.
"Well, maybe I happened to mention it to him..."
"He's coming here all the way from Canterlot to see your work, Rarity!"
"Whoa, Nelly!"
You could sell a ton o' dresses to this guy.
You business will be boomin'!
She'll escape.
"The day she tries to escape, shoot her."

"Ha Ni, it is my first piece of work."
So try it at least once.
"Eat it, okay?"
Okay. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I feel sorry towards Joon Gu... &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;but I'm really happy about being able to be next to Seung Jo again. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I'm excited but nervous at the same time. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Will I be able to do a good job?
Oh.
Where did it go?
I know I brought it in.
Is this yours?
Mine.
You took it didn't you?
Dummy.
It was on the ground right here.
Who would steal childish panties like those?
I only wear them once in a while.
I usually wear ones that have a lot of lace.
You don't have a body that can be considered sexy though.
Even the A Cup must be too big...
Did you stop growing after elementary school?
What did you say?
Hey.
"Seeing you like that, and not thinking of anything..."
Isn't that a big problem?
Is it that fun to make fun of me?
"If you don't like living with me, you can just say it."
You just grumpily keep making fun of people.
I'm grumpy?
Yeah.
Why am I doing that?
When I saw Suraj I realised that he was your son.
Arun's son.
But when he mentioned his father's name I kept silent.
He still doesn't know that I am his mother.
Promise me that you will never tell him the truth.
He won't learn from me.
But if there is a God he'll surely learn of his real parents someday.
"Hello, mother!"
- God bless you!
Come in.
Suraj's mother has come.
Hello!
Please have a seat.
"Sit, my dear."
I'm pleased to meet you.
"Renu, fetch some tea."
"No, that won't be necessary."
Sit beside me.
It is customary to offer something to a guest.
I have come to meet you as it is customary to do so.
You are the girl's father and I am the boy's mother.
Both of us should consent to this alliance.
Times have changed.
In these times the girl and the boy decide for themselves.
The parentsjust need to give their blessings.
Our happiness lies in their happiness.
For the sake of their happiness we should set the date immediately.
It is my wish too.
She's feeling shy.
- She's a child.
"Vandana, Suraj's mother has come."
She is my sister.
God always supports true lovers.
Let's see how much he supports us.
Now you go.
Listen!
My mother had given this locket to me in my childhood.
Radha!
"""You are my love, my dream-boy."""
"""You are a Hero of my love story."
"You are a hero!"""
"Yes, Damodar!"
"Uncle, Jackie has surrendered!"
- What?
"""You can take away my youth..."""
"""But return me my childhood's innocence."""
"""Ever since she has returned, she's silent."""
"""Wonder what could have happened in these 16 days."""
"""That young boy... and this young girl."""
"Aunt, stop it now."
"Since yesterday, we've cried enough."
Don't make her cry more.
Why would I do that?
Society will make her cry when they'll refuse her alliance.
"Sister-in-law, I'd suggest you to get her married... ...before the matter becomes public."
"""That paper boat..."""
Radha!
- Yes.
It seems you are hiding something from me.
"Yes, sister-in-law."
I'm carrying a burden in my heart.
Sister-in-law.
I can't hide anything from you and brother.
I want to share everything with you.
Thank you.
Standby.
Just one camera is enough to entertain us.
The outfits for today are very extreme.
"For three members, their outfits match the song."
For the other three...
Like this.
Up and down like this...
I want to do that again.
Cut!
Great work.
The end!
Great job.
"""Coffee Shop"" MV is over."
"""Coffee Shop"" is over and ""Hurricane"" is over too. our PAClFlC ToUR in 4 cities of America is over."
We're heading back to Korea tomorrow. our trip in America is now over.
I have many mixed emotions.
It was a long time in the U.S.
I'm glad everything finished well.
"""Coffee Shop"" and ""Hurricane"" music videos will come out well."
I'm looking forward to them.
Great work.
It's really over.
2 weeks have come to an end.
We're done.
"But really, the last shoot was the grand finale."
We were filming in the rain. on the rooftop.
"Which makes me feel better though, to think"
I tried my hardest up to the very end.
All or our schedules in the states are completed.
My clothes are all wet.
But I'm still very happy we're done with everything in the U.S.
"Then, we're all going out"
I have stuff to do at home I'm sorry
No exceptions this time
That was strong
I have to do the laundry and feed my dog
"That can all wait, can't it?"
My dog goes crazy if she misses a meal
"Then, let it go crazy"
I'll be there in spirit Sorry
"No, you'll be there in person!"
"If it isn't your parents' funeral, be there"
"- She'll never come - This time, she will"
- Bet $100?
- Sure
That's fascist
Fascist?
Me?
I just wanna take the whole crew out!
That doesn't make any sense What's with you?
I don't want to go
You have to
- No - Why?
Not everyone likes to drink
Then don't!
Drink Coke instead!
How can I drink Coke with beer in front of me?
Looking good
"Okay, fine"
I'll go
But I act out when I'm drunk
"Me, too"
I can drink 7 bottles of Soju
Do an interpretive dance with an accordion.
"And the best of you, the most worthy..."
"Tell me, friends, who do we call the most worthy?"
- Those with a good discipline.
"- Good, who else?"
- Who leave nothing on their plates.
- Who sleep during nap time.
- Who gather grass for rabbits.
- Very good.
"And so, the most worthy ones will be allowed... ...to join the circle of champions wearing masquerade costumes."
- Is showing magic tricks a talent?
- A talent.
"- Okay, I can show the ""flying queen"" card trick."
"- Good stuff, good stuff."
Only no cards.
"Kids, everything goes: magic tricks, art installations, pantomime..."
It's all good.
"Eat, eat."
- Mitrofanova!
"So, are the rumours true?"
- And Comrade Mitrofanov is coming as well!
"- My daddy is coming, too!"
"- You eat, eat."
Don't you know the rule?
No?
"All right, children, let's remind him the rule."
All together now.
- When I'm at my plate  all talks can wait.
- Nap time!
"- For them, but not for us."
"- Come on, come on."
"- Hey, guys."
From here it looks very small.
"But when you're in front of the statue, I hear you only see the body because it's too big."
That building there is where the 911 terror took place.
So they're rebuilding a new structure there.
"Come to think of it, what's that on the very top? on top of that building there's something like a fork-crane."
The person operating that - must be so scared.
- He must be very scared.
He must have more than one life or something.
I'm sad.
We're heading back to Korea the day after tomorrow.
I wanted to tour more before leaving.
None
New photographer.
He takes out his right hand from his pocket.
"Look that way, looks at the sky, hand on the hat..."
"His hand's up, and back down."
He's walking suavely
He puts his hands in his pockets.
Looking this way.
Don't laugh.
He's laughing. oh no.
He couldn't help but laugh.
"Honestly, it's really embarrassing."
"For both the doer and the watcher, it's embarrassing."
Nice.
I'm done.
We're out in NY right now.
How early did we get ready?
It's 11 AM right now.
"To film at 11 AM,"
You have to start getting ready at 7 AM.
Which means Young Jae and Dae Hyun
That's the slight catch.
The job's in New Zealand.
- What?
"- Look, I know it's a big deal and I don't have to decide anything yet."
I really want to discuss it with all the family.
It's a bit of a shock for us all but your dad's not going to do anything we're not happy with.
"Oh, Dad, you should totally go."
What an opportunity.
Yes.
One less parent to deal with.
If Dad goes to New Zealand I can easily get around Mum and have my dream party.
"Now, I just need a plan to show Robbie I'm a natural born snogger."
"So, I've figured out what I've got that Slaggy Lindsay doesn't."
Hair on the back of your legs?
- The Angus advantage.
- What?
Get in!
"Inside, now!"
You will wait for the judge to sentence you.
The prison warden is coming now.
Whoever tries to escape will end up in solitary confinement.
"Don't you know that, Nazif Kara?"
"Why did you try to escape, old man?"
Running to your wife &amp;amp; daughter?!
Tsk Tsk Tsk...
Sit down now!
What happened Kibarim?
I don't know.
"I went out, they pointed the gun at me and caught me."
Who is the rat that told them?
Nejdet wasn't waiting for you outside?
That idiot!
"I mean, I agree, but... aren't you supposed to be out, like, trying to decapitate someone..."
-with your lacrosse stick or something ?
"-Oh, sure."

"You know, I know what people think."
"It's like,"
"""Oz, he's just this kick-ass lacrosse player."""
"You know, I also play football, by the way, but that's, like,"
"- that's not all that I am, you know ?"
"- Of course, I didn't--"
"I mean, it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that."
You ?
You think I don't get that ?
"God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend... that people say, ""Oh, look."
"There's this Goody Two-Shoes choirgirl priss."""
Yeah.
"So, like, what else do you do ?"
"Well, the same things you do,"
Iike hang out with friends and stuff.
- Why ?
What do you think I do ?
"- Oh, l--"
I just realized that I don't know anything about you.
- I was interested.
"- Oh, well, what do you want to know ?"
"You know, stuff... about you."
All right.

Before the test begins we're going to determine hand and leg preferences.
Ready?
Can you kick the ball to me?
Ready?
I'm going to bounce it to you.
Now use one hand and bounce it back.
"Oh, nice job!"
The first thing we're going to do is use this pencil and I want you to take this car and draw a line and stay inside the row all the way down to the house.
Take your time and stay inside the row.
OK for our next activity
For this one we're going to take this paper and you see this line?
Fold it on the line just like this.
Can you do this one?
OK and now a big line right down the middle.
OK.
Do you see this square?
I want you to use this red pencil and draw the same shape in this square down here.
Just like that one.
I'll never meet Radha!
Never!

And not asked for her in alms.

"At least have some shame, you insolent!"
"No, father!"
Don't do that.

He's really a noble man.

We've spent every year in tears.
Only... only for your prestige.
"Father, I'm begging for my love."
Give my love to me.
And you... is this the reward you gave me for my love?
Is this the reward of my love?
Tell me... tell me.
- Father!
Tell me...
Tell her that her father is dead.
He's dead.

You were flirting with that girl and now you gave her to me!
"No, Rajesh!"
And you thought that I will marry her.. ..and shoulder your responsibility?
ls this called friendship?
Rajesh!
I can even lay down my life for your friendship!
This is what even I thought!
But now.. now I just want to ask you.. ..why did you thrust that girl on me!
Kona Ranga Rao becomes crores Ranga Rao.
I am placing my daughter in your hands.. ..you should make her a star and change my fate.
Do you have a five star cigarette?
Dont say anything else.
My stomach is about to split.
"Yes, my difficulties have become a joke for you."
Tell as what they are.
There are two matches.
One girl is very beautiful.
She likes me too.
But she does not have any money.
The other girl is average in looks.
But she is very wealthy
What is there in money?
You are lucky to find a girl who likes you.
Marry that girl who is not rich and you will be happy.
You are what I call a friend.
Now tell me the address of that which girl.
Give me water!
Someone close to you is remembering you.
Why do they remember even when they are close?
"Because they are close, they will remember.. ..either when close by or when far away."
Is that so?
"Hey, these people are getting very close."
It is better that we go away.
"Hey, Mr.Ranga Rao!"
Oh!
My father!
Where is your father?
There.
Near that scooter.
- Is that man your father?

'We believe that a boy and girl.. ..can have only one relation willingly.'
'And that's Raksha Bandhan.'
"So what I, I wasn't successful the first time."
But I still desired for love-marriage.
'Here's my marriage card.'
She handed me the card to her arranged marriage.
The third time I went up to the temple for the love marriage.
But I was slightly late.
No..
When love marriage isn't possible.. ..then what's the point of falling in love?
"Here, keep the glass."
And don't forget to pay him.
Fool.
- Yes!
What are you doing?
"Father, I am frying fritters."
Here.
Keep 10 rupees.
For the household expenses.
-Yes.
And if anything happens to the rose plants in my absence.. ..then I will send you to hell.
"But, Father, how is that possible?"
"Quiet, fool."

What was that all about ?
- He's still embarrassed because Finch kicked his ass.
- Who told you that ?
"What do you mean, ""no comment"" ?"
- Did you two hook up or something ?
"- What, are you kidding ?"
No.
Then how did all this get started ?
"Well, I guess it's all right for me to tell you now."
That reputation of his isn't going anywhere.
"Cheese, please."
"Finch comes up to me and says, ""Jessica,"
"I need your help with this, blah, blah, etcetera."""
"So I said, ""All right."
"Pay me 200 bucks, and I'll tell a couple of girls that you're dynamite in bed."""
"So he did, and I did."
- That actually works ?
"- Well, duh !"
Of course.
"Naturally, I embellished a little bit."
Did you hear that Finch had an affair with an older woman ?
[ Chuckling ]
"No, I didn't hear that one."
That one was my favorite.
[ Laughing ]
"Do that cheerleader. - - Thank you, baby - - She wants me."
She calls me up--
- How sweet it is to be loved by you --**
"Oh, my God, you're gay !"
How could you have come to that conclusion?
I'm telling you that I don't dislike you.
Being with you isn't easy but I'm just saying I don't hate it.
Thank you.
I really thought that you hated me.
"Ever since high school, I have only liked you."
I don't know anything about Sartre or Nietzsche .
And I can't even cook.
"And I'm not glamorous,"
"But still, I'll try my best."
I'll know to always try my best .
Really?
I'm looking forward to it.
What?
You getting smarter for me...
I'm looking forward to it.
Okay.
"Since the midterms are not that far away,"
That confession...
I'll make sure of it with the test results.
Okay?
Midterms?

C?!
What are you talking about getting a C.
Then C+?

"Don""t worry about me!"
"Don""t worry about me!"

Prepare the biggest tube.
You will have to go to deliver the gold with John and Pinto.
Gold from all over the world comes in lndia.
"And lndia""s gold goes abroad. kaka sir, syndicate has come to an end."
"Now for which party do we have to deliver this gold? kaka sir, he is dim-witted."
"Till the time he doesn""t.. ..understand everything he won""t work."
"You explain to him. sher khan, the enemy country is paying double for the gold."
Got it?
We will earn four times the profit through international means.
Meaning they will buy weapons with this gold.
"And use it against us in the war. - sher khan! sher khan won""t do this derogatory act!"
"And he won""t let anybody do this!"
I tell you to obey my orders!
- lmpossible!
"This gold is our country""s wealth! our country needs it desperately!"
Some good waltz.
People could waltz.
Back when the older people...
Square dances.
I even knew how to square dance.
Not good.
"By any means, but that was one of the things that you did."
There'd be somebody who could square dance.
Uncle
John did.
That'd be Kay's grandfather.
Uncle John - last name?
Uncle John Gallagher.
And the step dancing - Who would be playing for the step dance?
That'd be Jule and Pat and they'd just
"liven it up, you know..."
Remember any other songs that they'd play?
No.
But the whole family would be there.
Things like that went on in the family. ...
The families were involved in all that kind of stuff.
The Gillespies?
"No, I meant, say you had 3 kids."
"You went with your 3 kids, and one would fall asleep, 3 years old, and the other would run him home or something like that."
It wouldn't be just the - you have to be 18 to go in there.
"Okay, it would be the whole family?"
Sure.
"Yeah, that's great."
It was a good time.
A good time growing up here.
"Riding horses, skiing behind the horses, skiing behind the Model As, the cars."
Sliding down the hill.
"I am ASlAN, Man."
Who cares?
"Dude, Asian guys are the bottom of the totem pole (Slap) Owwww.."
"""Bottom of the totem pole""?"
That is the most low self-esteem crap.
I have ever heard
This is a fact
The only people that say Asian guys are the bottom of the totem pole are Asian guys!
I have never heard a girl go
I don't date Asian guys cuz they are
The bottom of the totem pole
Oh my god.
You are so right!
Never heard that before... from a girl
Asian guys!
Why are we so pessimistic?
We are smart
We are clean
We don't sweat a lot.
We are exotic.
We are super exotic!
Asian guys are really at the bottom of the totem pole which we are not it's not cuz we are ugly or cuz we smell bad
It's cuz we have little.....
Confidence
Yeah.
Confidence.
You..
"You were thinking something dirty,"
Weren't you?
"Asian guys, we need to stand up."
We need to stand up and... and be brave.
We need to stand up and grow a pair
It's our first experience.
I couldn't do anything because I was frozen.
I'm sure Jong Up can do well though.
Jong Up is Americanized.
"lndeed, when this fancy background and"
Jong Up's slick dancing skills...
That was awesome.
I'm enjoying Las Vegas very much.
Filming is fun too.
But my bangs...
I'm gold from head to toe.
"Honestly, it was something I'd wanted to try some time."
I'm honored to have gotten my chance so early.
It's very very nice.
I wanted to visit because of the glamorous scenery.
I'm more excited than usual because we're shooting a MV here.
"More than tension, I'm having so much fun."
There's no time to be tense.
I'm your fan.
Please give me an autograph.
- There was no time to be nervous.
- Can I have an autograph please?
I think those sunglasses suit Bang Yong Guk more for sure.
I'll show you a real performance.
It's about 6 AM right now.
"More so than being very tired, no lies, it's so much fun."
I always feel I'm lacking.
lf I say I'd like to try again
We're good to go for a re-shoot but I still feel like it's lacking.
But that still feels lacking.
I'm not satisfied because it seems the same.
"Alright, all finished. okay"
"5 is a prime number, so we'll put 5 right there."
"And then, 12 is the same thing as 26, and 6 = 23."
"So, in our LCM, we have to have two 2's, but we already have two 2's, and we already have one 3."
"Another way to think about it, is that something that is divisible by both 9 and 4 is going to be divisible by 12."
"And then finally, we need it to be divisible by 15's prime factors."
15 is the same thing as 3*5.
"So once again, we already have 3 and 5."
"So, this is our least common multiple (LCM)."
"So, LCM is going to be equal to 33225 =180"
"So, our LCM is 180."
"So, we want to rewrite all of these fractions with 180 in the denominator."
"So, our first fraction, 4/9, is what over 180?"
"To go from 9 to 180, we have to multiple 9 by 20."
"So, to get the denominator to equal 180, we multiple by 20."
"Since we don't want to change the value of the fraction, we should also multiple by the 4 by 20."
4*20 = 80.
"So, 4/9 is the same thing as 80/180."
"Now, let's do 3/4."
What do we have to multiple the denominator by to equal 180?
You can divide 4 into 180 (180/4 = x) to figure that out.
4*45 = 180.
"Now, you also have to multiple the numerator by 45."
3*45 = 135.
"So, 3/4 equals 135/180."
Now let's do 4/5.
"To get 180 from 5, multiple 5 by 36."
"Have to multiple numerator by same number, 36."
"So, 144/180."
And then we have only two more to do.
180/12 = 15.
"Same for numerator, 15."
"So, 11/12 = 165/180."
"Habibe Hanım, I've brought your ointments."
Habibe called me and said she wouldn't be home.
"But brought them anyway, as I'm on my way to Galip Usta."
I thought I'd find someone in the house.
You shouldn't have.
Because we don't want your medicines from now on.
No one wants your cures in this village anymore.
- Why not?
- You know what your son did.
And you let him get away with it.
Kerim didn't do anything.
So what they say is right...
You're shamelessly denying it.
Look...
You don't know what really is the case.
"- That corrupt family, the Yaşarans are behind it."
"- Get lost, stop slandering people."
I am telling the truth.
It's me who's telling you!
It's me!
I healed your wounds for years!
I swear on everything I know and I believe in.
They put those pisliks crime on my son!
You're still protecting that bastard?
"Leave, now!"
And never knock on any door in this town again.
"If you don't want to be as lowly as her, you should never talk to her again."
"If you were our Ebe Nine, you'd have let them put him into prison."
- You let him get away with it.
- That's not true.
- That's not true.
"- Either way, no body wants you here anymore."
Exactly...
"Exactly, in this way I had dropped the cup... ...when I heard about it for the first time."
"Actually, Mr. Shreekant, Jimmy clearly told me... ...that if they couldn't marry, they'll commit suicide."
Yes.
Yes.
"So, I'm thinking over it and you too must think All of us must think over it."
After all it's a question of our prestige.
What if they elope and do register marriage?
Then?
Then?
And what if they'll really commit suicide?
Then?
Tell them to commit suicide and you too do the same.
God!
Nephew?
- What?
Who...
"What nonsense is this, Damodar?"
"It's not nonsense, uncle."
It's a fact.
"Look, uncle."
It's difficult for me to speak the truth... ...and for you to hear it.
That's why I had to do this drama.
But it's true that Radha and that boy are really in love.
"Damodar, have you seen the boy?"
"Yes, of course."
Instead I know him.
I know him very well.
"Aunt, if we won't accept Radha's proposal... ...we may repent in future."
Damodar!
- Why will Damodar lie to us?
Boy is studying medicine in America.
I'm a public official.
I feel it's my responsibility to be as frank as possible
"You know, if this truth thing catches on###, I'm gonna be out of a job. are you going to continue having sexual cooper, even while she's still working for you?"
We've never had sex
Yeah right
No really it's true
I want you to listen to me.
I'm gonna say this again.
I did not have sexual relations with that woman Ms. Cooper.
It's almost lunch time Paul
How are you feeling
Get out.
I'm over you
"You know, you want it"
"I've got a perfectly good egg salad sandwich, all right?"
It's got everything you want.
Except meatballs
"Okay, you're fine."
Don't even think about it
Put it out of your head###
Meat
Ball
Shut up
All of you shut up
"Look, sir, this is an easy fix."
All you gotta do is go back out there and tell them the truth
I told them the truth
"Yeah, but it wasn't the truth they wanted to hear, so to them it's a lie."
I lied? it's only a lie if you don't say it.
Say what the truth
Whose truth
Theirs
You first go home.
- Let us go home.
"Ok, come on let us go."
Is that you?
- You remember me?
"Yes, are you from Warnagal?"
"No madam, I am from Vijayawada."
I came to Warangal to purchase vegetables.
My name is Venkat.
I studied polytechnic.
Height 62.
"Please tell me your name, address and other details."
Is it so urgent?
I dont want to miss again.
I am very sorry.
That day my father was in toilet.
With out knowing that I.
Leave that matter.
You must be tired by now.
"You are dancing till now from the moment we met, in my dreams."
I have to take you to my friends immediately.
That Jagan argues that no one is beautiful than Aiswarya.
He will shut his mouth if he sees you once.
Are you trying to impress me?
No madam.
I have already impressed you.
I think you like the rain very much.
Rain is my friend.
Correct madam.
It rained when we first met.
It is raining today also.
That means you friend rain is trying to unite us.. ..which means there is something between us.
Your testimony and your blessings.
How did you know the deceased  when he was still healthy and among us?
[Crowd:]
He was a good man!
- Do you testify that he was a good muslim?
- We do!
"Earthly or unworldly, materially and spiritually make all your rights halal to him."
Helal olsun.
Helal ediniz.
"- One more time, for God's blessings."
- Helal olsun.
"May God accept your prayers, your testimony and blessings for the deceased."
May he rest in peace.
It's a very fine piece.
Hand made.
Great craftsmanship.
But this alone don't mean much.
It is valuable only with its pair.
Otherwise it's just like a button.
Wish you could find the other one as well.
Then I wouldn't want to sell it.
"Anyway, maybe we'll find it."
If we can't...
Then my husband will keep it as a heirloom.
- Thank you.
"- Have a nice day, miss."
We've come with great news.
Is that so?
How nice.
The forward buyings are going great.
We revitalized the market.
- Glad to hear that.
"I'm sorry, No Ri."
This is nothing.
I'm already used to it.
"After Eun Jo got admitted, everyday is fun."
I can learn from Seung Jo hyung.
And I have laughed a lot because of Ha Ni noona.
I wasn't intending to be funny though...
"Okay, let's just rest for today."
"When your fever goes down, I'll teach you again."
Yes.
What is his sickness?
It seems like he has a problem with his heart.
"Oh, I see."
"That little kid has to get shots, take tests, and eat bitter medicine everyday."
He can't even do everything he wants to do.
There's no use in your crying.
That's right.
"If it was you, you could have done something to help him."
What can I do?
You're a genius.
"So if you put your mind into being a doctor, you can easily do it."
"So, it would be great if you could be a doctor, so you could heal many people like No Ri."
Everyone would be grateful towards you.
How does it sound?
"If you tell me to become a doctor, does that mean I have to become a doctor?"
"Yeah, please do it."
It's a really good idea right?
Well...
Being a doctor is best for you.
Baek Seung Jo wearing an all white lab coat...
I want to see you like that.
You're incorrigible . . .
You go ahead.
I'll bring your baggage.
"It's okay, abi."
I got it.
"- Give me one of them, if you want."
"- It's okay, you go ahead."
The fridge is full of food.
And I had the house cleaned yesterday.
Have a nice time in there.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
No one can bother you here.
Good bye.
"Call me, if you need anything."
And I bring it to you.
- Bye bye.
- All right.
So... ... guess this'll be our home for a while.
Just ours.

I miss her smile.
She had an amazing smile.
"One time, I remember she had just gotten her braces off, and she thought she was for sure that she was going to go work for a toothpaste company, and be one of those people that had their smile on the toothpaste box."

The morning of November the 10th was just a regular day.
Alex didn't have to be at school till 9:30 because of her college classes that she was taking in high school.
"So, Katrina and I went on to school."
"When I left, I just called her name and said, ""I'm leaving!"""
"And she went, ""Wait a minute!"""
"And she came running out of her room, and she came up there, and gave me a hug, and pushed her hair back"
"like she did every day, and I kissed her on the forehead, and said ""Be good today."""
And I left.
"Wow, it is gone."
What is this?
I missed the opportunity.
Is she that beautiful?
Who may be the blessed person that gave birth to.. ..such a beauty?!
She is from the abode of the gods.
Give me 2 liters.
Wait for 5 minutes.
We are in important discussion.
You came without knowing the name or address of the girl?
I could not find.
- Why was that happened?
What will you do here without those details?
That is the issue I am unable to solve.
Nothing is there to solve.
Just forget about her.
Why do you discourage him like that?
Encourage him.
Look here my dear Salim - My name is Venkat.
No.
If you are searching for your Anarkali then you are Salim.
You look so dynamic.
Why are you.. ..listening to this burnt out fellow?
Thats it.
"Look here, dont be depressed that you missed her."
Search!
- There is nothing you cannot find if you search.
"Who are you sir, giving advice freely?"
"Ranga Rao, a big name in the states."
I came here now.
I am planning to settle down in Warangal.
Thinking to settle in Warangal?
I am coming....
Here.. drink...
I threw my beautiful daughter into the fire with my own hands.
She had so many opportunities!
I fell under the spell of this huge mansion.
"But, now, I am in pain inside."
My daughter has no more tears left from crying so much.
This fire is going to consume me and you..
"Look, Naciye... you look like this, but.. ... you are a mother, too."
How do I look?
Frizzy haired Naciye from Odakli Village..
"Look, idiot.."
"Pay for the soda, then leave... is this a charity house?"
Here.. if only your soda had some flavor!
"Rude, insolent!"
Idiot!
Thank you.
"Ya, Yasar..?"
Is he still not using anything?
"That is, Mustafa, in that condition?"
"Look, I am going to say something, but..."
"Maybe, Mustafa is faking?"
This is Mustafa Bulut we are talking about!
"Medicines, needles, mean nothing to this man!"
"Abi, I told you, I saw it with my own eyes!"
The man doesn't recognize any of us!
Don't you think I would know from his gaze?
Of course!
Why would he fake this?
"Well, maybe he is trying to guilt you all, because you put him in the nut house."
"It's possible, isn't it?"
"You can go tomorrow, and see for yourself, then!"

We think you'll be pleasantly surprised by who you'll find and who you can follow.
Woman:
Nick?
Is it really you?
It is.
Oh... ( chuckling )
"Oh, my dear, lost love!"
I'm paralyzed with happiness.
"Jordan, this is my second cousin once removed, nick carraway."
"Does that mean we kiss when we greet, or no?"
I hope it means we do.
Tom says you've just come from chicago.
Tell me everything.
Do they miss me?
The whole town is desolate.
"Oh, how gorgeous."
All the cars have their left rear wheel
"Painted black as a mourning wreath,"
And there's a persistent wail all night.
"Let's go back tomorrow, tom."
I love a persistent wail.
"Well, I love a drink."
"Come on, let's all have a drink."
( sighs )
I've been lying on that sofa for as long as I can remember.
You live across the sound in west egg.
I know somebody there.
I don't know a single person.
You must know gatsby.
- Find her quickly!
"- Yes, Sir!"
Try and stand up.
You should act more like a lady.
You got hurt because you involved yourself with thieves.
But it's fun.
You must think this is fun because you've never been hurt before.
But it's not fun if you're really hurt.
"Yes, I've never been hurt before."
Because I never got involved in anything.
Now you know that you can get hurt if you get involved in things you don't know about.
Just live like you normally live.
I let you do all this because I thought you knew where your boundaries were.
But you crossed that boundary today.
But I was worried about you.
That's crossing the boundary.
You can't come any closer.
Go back behind your boundary.
You're smart so you should understand.
Yes.
I understand very well.
Then go home.
Hong Gil Dong!
"Because of you, I hurt myself for the first time."
But I don't mind being hurt for you.
That's because you've never been badly hurt before.
I'm scared of the pain.
"But if I'm that scared, then perhaps I should stop."
- Don't come to the mountain again.
- Then come here in two weeks.
I'll wait for you.
For the last time.
Just run away.
Just run.
Don't ask why you're going to get the eight pages; just go get them.
Don't play it at night.
You will... you'll die.
Don't play it alone at all.
Or in the dark... you two.
"(Finebros) And finally, will you ever play ""Slender"" again?"
- Probably not.
- Never.
"- God, no!"
- No!
Maybe to see if it has the same effect.
"Maybe if I'm, like with my friends in broad daylight, yeah."
Yes.
I am going to go play it.
Yes.
"Yes, I will."
"I know, for some reason, I'm gonna end up playing it again."
"Curiosity is gonna get the best of me, and I'ma play it again."
"Thanks for watching ""Teens React."""
"If you liked the video, make sure you give it a thumbs-up or the Slender Man might get ya."
"Make sure you subscribe, or I'll send Slender Man after you and your children."
"If you're scared of Slender, just listen to this joke, okay?"
What do you call a shoe made from a banana?
A slipper.
Ha!
"I'll see you next time, unless Slender Man gets me."
"(feigning scream, chuckles)"
Ajahn Brahm:
"Okay, I did notice there's a few people with sore throats who've got coughing, so to make it nice and peaceful during the talk can we all cough in unison at the beginning"
[laughter] and have it all done away.
"No, I don't."
I don't know.
What are you saying?
I...
I can't remember.
I drank and blacked out.
"That is why I told you to be careful, didn't I?"
There are always eyes everywhere.
Who the heck did something like this?
"President, who brought these photos?"
I will immediately just!
There is no need for that.
I already took care of it.
Indeed!
"Still, we can't be relieved."
We don't know when other photos will circulate.
That can't happen.
All my female fans will disappear.
These photos are completely embarrassing.
"So, go abroad for awhile and take a rest."
It is easier to take care of it when you aren't around.
What about the schedules?
"Do you know the saying, ""penny-wise and pound-foolish?"""
We can't incur a great loss by pursuing a small profit.
Go!
Go Dong will be waiting for you downstairs.
Hyungnim!
Over here!
What is this?
It's this car again?
The President said to be careful so that we aren't seen by others.
"Get in, Hyung."
"May it be easy, dot com.."
What's up?- you tell me..(the news comes from you).
What?
I am saying news come from you.
Anyhow you follow the two sides.
"What are you saying, man?"
"I'm saying anything... whatever, what can i tell you.."
"What kind of a girl are you, man?"
How do you play with everyone separately?
"Look here, you, what are you bullying around?"
"While your best friend was living a tragedy last night, you went to hang out with the others."
How was it?
Did you have fun at least?
"Whith who did i go, i don't understand?"
With Hale and others...Now you blackbirded to Mira for atonement....
Congratulations.
"I'm looking, even there is no Sun to have affected your head.But firstly, last night I was at home all the time ."
We talked with Mira by phone until this morning.
"So ,this night you were not with Orkun and others?"
First repair your head...
Unbalanced!
Well balanced!
(Stable) !
"Yaman, where?"
"I am going to the other side to my neighborhood,I have things to do on the reeve."
Jump in..
"No, thanks, the bus is coming.."
"Come on, get it."
I was going to piano lesson.
I could not stay at home.
"I wanted to get out as soon as possible. get in, i 'il drive you, and we can talk as well."
I will get out by the metro station.
"""And it seems he won't change his statement unless he gives up on Cemre."""
"""I know, you don't care about it."""
"""You would rather staying in prison than being free with his testimony."""
"""Because you're a person like that."""
"""You wouldn't hesitate to sacrifice..."""
"""... yourself, your life for those you love."""
"""I wish I could be one of those people."""

"""Take care, Kuzey."""
"""Hope to see you soon."""
Why do you keep looking behind you?
- I look to see if anyone's following.
- Barış is right.
This has been an obsession in you.
You need to relax.
"Nothing as it look, Zeynep."
He still wants to kill me.
Who?
Barış.
He will not rest until he gets rid of me.
"Do you hear what you say, Burak?"
You don't know Barış.
He is so dangerous.
He killed Ferhat.
He's the one who put the gun in my car.
He also sabotaged my car.
Did you tell this to the police?
"No, because I need to find an evidence first."
"That is, if he doesn't kill me before."
"No, that will not happen."
"Don""t worry, sir."
Friendship is nothing compared to duty. very good!
This is what I expected from you.
Now you can declare him a criminal.
"And declare a reward of 50,000 rupees on his arrest. okay, sir."
- Thank you!
All the best!
How come you all are here today?
What has brought you here?
"What""s the matter, Mr. Diwan?"
- Where is shekhar?
I dismissed him a long time ago.
"But what""s the matter? shekhar has disappeared with gold worth 7 crores."
Gold worth 7 crores!
"Well done, shekhar!"
Great!
"You have served our country well! served? constable, our country needs gold desperately! our country could have got gold worth 7 crores! shekhar should receive a reward for this deed!"
"Bhuta singh, you too are misunderstanding!"
- How so?
You brought gold worth 100 rupees. okay.
But when did I bring it?
Just assume that you brought gold worth 100 rupees. okay.
- How will you make the payment?
By giving the goods.
- How much?
"For gold worth rupees 100, I will sell it at 200. so it""s a loss to the country."
Goods worth 100 came in.
"And goods worth 200 went out. constable, how can this be a loss to the country?"
The gold entered the country for free.
That is what I am asking.
Where is that gold?
"That is the problem, constable."
O my God!
Hey!
Stop there.
Sorry sir.
Are you Venkat?
Yes sir.
Get into the jeep.
Why sir?
I will tell you in the station.
What is my crime sir?
Since you are supplying gunpowder.. ..to terrorists to prepare dynamite.
Dynamite!?
"Sir, I am working as supervisor .. ..in Shakti transport company."
Your owner has revealed your name.
Confess yourself kid.
I have surrendered myself.
Why do you want to have a dispute with police?
They will beat you.
Accept the truth.
I will kill you.
He is telling lies.
I dont know about any thing.
You tell the truth.
Do you remember what you said that day?
You said your lover insulted you.
You want to earn money in any way.
I took you into my company after I explained all the details.
"I had even promised to give you 10,000 rupees per month."
You are trying to drag me into this?
"Venkat, stop."
"Sir, please dont do it."
You are in uniform.
Think logically.
"Because logically.. - Grandpa, grandpa, grandpa."
What is this?
You were supposed to explain to Bunty about marriage and not logic.
"Don't change the topic, Tanya."
"Sir, you were saying something extremely important."
Please go ahead.
"We can.. - Yes, yes."
We can see the alpha Changeli.. ..which is four light years away from us.
We don't look at it the way we should.
But we look at it just as it looked four years ago.
Correct?
- Correct.
The star called Turios that we see.
We see it like it was nine years ago.
We don't watch it..
By the way.. do you look at your face in the mirror?
Yes!
Every hour.
That isn't fresh either.
Its 10 nanoseconds old.
Tell me.. if you get an opportunity to go back into the past.. ..which mistake would you rectify?
My mom and dad's marriage.
"Yes, Grandpa, this is the topic."
Marriage.
Now ask him why refuses to marry me.
"Yes, why don't you want to get married?"
I am scared.
It's just an excuse.
If you have the courage to fall in love.. ..then you should be prepared for marriage as well.
Logically you should marry Tanya.
Stop saying that.
"Kanji, people say you're doing this for publicity?"
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
Down with.. - Kanji!
- You?
- You will sit here.
"Sit, sit."
Hey insurance..
How's the Rolex?
Working fine.
Relax.
Relax.
He's the one who spread the rumour about God eating butter.
All rise.
"Kanji, get up."
Mr. Kanji Lalji Mehta.
"- Yes, sir."
We've been informed that you'll defend your own case.
Yes..
"I don't have any other option, Your Honour."
The other lawyers are scared.
"So, I'll have to defend this case.."
"My lordship, this is a baseless appeal."
A publicity stunt.
There's no cause of action that can be proved in court.
"So I suggest, under order 7 rule no.11.. ..of the code of civil procedure."
This case be straightaway dismissed.. ..for out of cause action.
"Your Honour, my English isn't that good.. ..but I do understand that he's asking.. ..to shut down this case immediately."
Right?
You're right.
I don't want to get into this hassle in the first place.
"I'm a Gujarati, businessman."
What do you think she's makin'?
Looks like a dress.
"Well, that makes sense."
Since this is a dressmaker's shop and all.
Is there something I can help you with?
"Oh, so very sorry to trouble you, Rarity, but I need a quick favor."
Could you please fix the button for me?
It's my dress for the Grand Galloping Gala.
"Oh, no, no, no!"
You can't wear this... old thing.
You need a glamorous new outfit for the Gala.
And I'll make it for you.
No problem at all.
It will be my pleasure!
"Oh, that's really sweet of you to offer, Rarity, but I can't let you do that."
It would be so much work.
This dress is fine.
Twilight Sparkle.
I insist on making you a new dress.
-But...
"-No no, not a word!"
I won't take no for an answer.
"Well, in that case..."
"Thank you for your generosity, Rarity."
"Knowing your handiwork, I'm sure it will be absolutely beautiful."
"Let me guess, Applejack."
You don't want a new gown either.
Gown?
Shoot.
I was just gonna wear my old work duds.
"You can't possibly be serious, Applejack!"
You absolutely must wear formal attire.
Two months.
He says the kid hugged you.
So?
Nothing but a lousy gardener.
But he's alive.
Pryor might not want a dead man on his conscience.
"Yeah, what does he care?"
What he did to me.
He sits on his pennies.
"Yeah, what have we got to lose?"
Some money is better than no money.
All you gotta do is make another phone call.
"Well, if you won't do it, I will."
"All right, all right."
"You're in luck, Frank."
We're gonna trade you in.
"Ordinarily, I wouldn't have asked you to drop by, Lieutenant."
Probably just a crank call.
Something else happened this morning that disturbed us.
"Oh, thank you very much, Mr. Pryor."
What was it that disturbed you?
"Well, we found one of our cars down the road."
"It was abandoned, the key still in the ignition."
Stolen?
"No, nothing like that."
Our gardener was bringing it back from town.
"Look, it's probably just a false alarm."
I think he got bored with this job and took off.
Frank would have told us.
He's a responsible man.
"My wife has great faith in human nature, lieutenant."
She should have been a social worker.
Send me the case files and tell me when to be in court.
"Thank you, doctor."
We need this.
"Before he was arrested, Father Moore sent this to me."
He asked me to take care of it.
It's your burden now.
One more thing.
When you saw Emily... ...did Father Moore ask you to give her any medical help?
He was already trying to stop her from injuring herself and urging her to eat.
"And I told him, as a doctor, I couldn't help her."
Dr. Cartwright's going to testify.
Don't you get it?
He's not just an eyewitness to the exorcism.
He can also refute the prosecution's medical case.
This is huge for us.
When do I get to testify?
I don't know.
Let's take this one step at a time.
No.
"What matters most is Emily's story, which only I can tell."
I understand.
Have you thought about what I said before?
About dark forces and demonic attacks?
"Yes, I have."
"That day, after Briggs testified... *..."
I was feeling awful. *
*And I went out for a walk* *just to clear my head... *
*... and I was thinking about* *what you said to me.
Thinking:*
"*""What if demons really do exist?""*"
And wondering what that would mean if I believed that.
"Because God knows, I have my own demons."
Hello!
May I speak to your sister?
- Sure.
Don't hide your face.
I recognised you as soon as I saw you.
My husband died 4 years ago.
I have been looking for you ever since in order to apologise to you.
To apologise to me?
- Yes.
He told me everything about you before his death.
So you know that... - Suraj is your son.
And I also know the circumstances under which my brother died.
I am ashamed of myself.
I was very mean to you.
Forgive me if you can.
"- What are you doing, sister?"
Since the day I have learned the truth... ...
I have not considered Suraj my son but your safe keeping.
And I am waiting for the moment when I can give him to you.
Suraj must never learn the truth.
He is an excellent pilot.
He will soon marry Renu.
They have a bright future together.
"If he learns that it is not you but I who am his mother,... ... a woman who has spent 12 years in prison for murder,... ... he will be shattered."
He won't be able to hold his head high.
His life will be destroyed.
Don't you care about your own life?
Won't you accept your son after going through so much pain?
Only you have the right to be called his mother.
You are responsible for what he is today.
"But, Suraj is your son."
"No, sister."
I can let Emily answer that.
"""Last night, on Allhallows' Eve... ...Father Moore tried to cast six demons from my body."
They refused to go.
"After the attempted exorcism..."""
"*I was taken to my room,* *and I fell into a deep sleep. *"
"*I awoke a few hours later,* *hearing a voice calling out my name. *"
"*""Again, I heard a voice* *calling my name. *"
It was the Blessed Holy Mother of God.
And when I looked at her... ...she smiled at me and said:
"'Emily, heaven is not blind to your pain.""'"
She said the Virgin Mary spoke to her in the middle of a field?
- Yes.
- And do you believe her?
I believe Emily spoke the truth.
Please continue.
"*""I asked the Blessed Mother,* *'Why do I suffer like this?""'*"
Why did the demons not leave me tonight?
"*""She said, 'I am sorry, Emily. *"
*The demons are going to stay* *where they are.'*
"*Then she said,* *'You can come with me in peace... *"
*... free of your bodily form... *
*... or you can choose* *to continue this. *
*You will suffer greatly. *
"*But through you, many will come to* *see that the realm of the spirit is real. *"
"*The choice is yours.""'*"
I choose to stay.
"""In the end, good will triumph over evil."
Through my experience... ...people will know that demons are real.
People say that God is dead.
"But how can they think that... ...if I show them the devil?"""
Did you see these wounds on both of Emily's hands and both feet?
Yes.
"You can""t see all this!"
"You can""t see all this!"
- Leave me!
Leave me!
Leave!
Leave my mother!
Leave her!
Leave my sister!
Leave her!
"lf you raised chaos, I will shoot you!"
Leave me!
Leave me!
You save yourself and leave!
"lf you too died with me, then who will.. ..take revenge for this family?"
"I don""t want to live! shekhar, why don""t you understand?"
"Look, one bullet is still left."
You are under my oath!
You have to take our revenge!
You become Tiger!
Tiger!
A wounded tiger always takes his revenge!
Go and jump in the water!
Go!
Go!
"My sister killed herself to save the family""s honour."
And I jumped in the ocean!
A captain sailing a ship saved me!
"I finished my education with Rajesh""s help."
"I can hear my mother and sister""s screams all the time!"
While dying my sister had said.. ..to take revenge from these scoundrels!
"And that desire of revenge has made me Tiger! seema.. till the time I don""t take revenge from them.. ..l won""t rest in peace."
"I won""t rest in peace! crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook. crook."
And always smile.
- I'm sorry.- It's okay.
"We can sit, if you want.I keep stepping on your foot."
Dance with Fatmagül.Go ahead.
"# I withheld my eyes,# Kept my words quiet."
"# Scattered my ashes,"
It's been so long since I last danced.Was never good at it.# While my flame is alive.
Just leave yourself to the flow of the music.
At least good things like this also happen in our life.
Enjoying this night despite everything... ... the best way of fighting our enemies.
- This is our second dance.- The first one was a reluctant one.
I was excited that day at least as much as today.
"They were beautiful that day, but...Your eyes are even more beautiful now."
"- Mustafa where are you?- I am outside, what's up?"
I'm told you didn't come to work all day.I got worried.
I had some matters to take care of.
"Good then, I was afraid of you and Kerim getting at each other again."
- Nothing happened just yet.- What does it mean now?
Nothing.
I mean don't worry.
- There's nothing I should be afraid of then.- Nope.
"- Alright, good then."
See you later.- Laters.
Damned bastard!
He is acting all bravebecause he knows we depend on him.
"My hands are tiedGod damn it, I can't punish him right now."
We need to remain calmuntil the trial.
How dare he do that to me!
No way Reşat...
I don't think this could be true.
- I expect anything from him... - But not from Meltem.
I don't believe that Meltemwould do such a thing.
Shailu is mine.
Dont play with love.
You will be ruined.
I will kill you if you obstruct my daughters path.
I prayed to God that they should be united.
God granted my wish.
That is all I want.
He piers my heart with the spear of love
He is the real man
Look how handsome my life partner is
She resembles the dancing waterfall
His sharp eyes pierce my heart
She has a body like a flower filled with honey
I will arrest you in my embrace
I will guard you against all odds
"O beautiful swan, you gave me a sweet pain"
I have a lot of belief in you
I felt the heat of your love
I owe my entire life to you
What is it?
Nothing.
Where did son in law go?
Wait here.
I will search for him.
Venkat!
You scoundrel!
Why do you stab from behind like that?
"If you are a man who took a mothers milk, fight from the front."
Let us decide the winner.
"Hey, what do you think?"
Do you think that he was brought up on donkeys milk?
Do you think that he cannot fight you?
Nooooooo.... of course not!
"We like people with big hearts, not big houses..."
Like you all....
"But, we can't continue like this..."
"Yes, yes, you can... and, you are company for my mother, as welil..."
Don't let anyone trouble themselves for now...
"I am leaving, Mom."
"- If you need anything for this evening, call, okay?"
"- Okay, my dear."
"See, how well she is talking???"
She got her voice back!
"Bravo, Doctor, Bravo!!!"
"You couldn't take my son's life, but you took away his mind."
"Did you hate us, this much, eh?"
Mustafa doesn't even know his own mother!
Is your conscience clear?
It is normal.
"How can this be normal, Doctor?"
"It has only been a week, and my brother doesn't recognize any of us!"
"Right now, he is going through an intense treatment and medication program."
"Because, he refused to eat, we have hooked him up to an I.V."
We need time to see the results of the medication.
"So, what are we to do, then?"
"Don't worry, and be patient."
He is going to get well.
Don't reduce your visits.
Come often as possible.
Spend time together.
It will be good for him.
"Would you like to go to a doctor, Duriye?"
No..
I don't want to..
Lyuty and his men are billeted there.
You say she's at the inn?
"Lock my freedom behind iron bars,"
"I'll steal it, bars and all."
"Lock my freedom behind iron bars,"
"I'll steal it, bars and all."
"Out sailed the moon, then again"
Hid her fair face.
"Lock the black steed behind five iron locks,"
"I'll steal it, locks and all."
"I've known God and the devil,"
I've been God and the devil.
"Imprison the maid behind a high fence,"
"I'll steal her, fence and all."
"Imprison the maid behind a high fence,"
"I'll steal her, fence and all..."
Give us a dance!
Give him the guitar.
"Give us a dance, Gypsy!"
"All of us are feeble, for we are but mortals."
Vodka!
"Way to go, the black head!"
"You're sharp, Gypsy!"
I know a pure-blooded little filly when I see her!
How can you tell?
By her teeth.
I looked round -
A coffin flying over the graves!
And beside the road - ghosts with scythes.
And not a sound!
"Drink, sinner!"
Learn to partake of our fare.
He came to talk to me.
He claims that Barış hired a man to go into jail for him.
"Come on, really?"
He made himself believe in that.
He thinks the man got himself caught on purpose.
That's why this happened after we confronted Barış.
He believes this story in his mind.
I think we shouldn't go deep on this.
We should just leave the rest to the police.
True.
"I just don't want to be suspicious of anyone around me, anymore."
And I made some spinach börek.
Kuzey's favorite.
It hasn't cooked yet.
It will be in 5 minutes.
Will you be okay while I am not here?
"Don't worry, I'll be home all day today."
But our girl is doing well.
She's getting better everyday.
"She'll be even better, inshallah."
Her face is getting more colorful as well.
The weather is fine today.
I'll go out in the yard with her.
"Careful, don't let her get cold."
- We'll be careful.
- Really though...
You sure you don't need to be at work?
"I'll feel so bad, if you have to stay here because of me."
No.
I don't have anything important to do at the company today.
I scheduled today to spend some time with my daughter.
Great.
I will consider later.
SlR I felt like..
"Hey, you are starting a song when you are asked for a story."
You got your money.
Now leave.
What did he see in me to lend me this money?
If he gave you money without a mortgage.. ..then you must have something as valuable as gold.
What do I have?
I have a golden heart.
Gali Ganna Rao speaking.
Where is the rain?
We dont have rain in stock.
It is out of stock.
"How can rain the out of stock, you fool!"
You idiot!
Everyone calls me a fool.
But you have.. ..lovingly called me and idiot.
Who are you?
You said that there would be rain after 48 hours.. .. six minutes and eight seconds.
Where is the rain?
"Is it you, seed of love?"
Rain is not a wife to come as soon as it is called.
"Of course, my wife does not come even when I call her."
Then whose call will she respond to?
Are you talking about the rain or my wife?
At present we are talking about your wife.. ..tell me about the rain.
The rain was supposed to come.
"But the low pressure.. ..crossed Orissa, West Bengal and then moved over to Bangladesh."
Then what are you doing here without going to Bangladesh.
I do not have a passport.
"What passport, you anthrax......!"
"My boy, you are inventing new words to swear at me."
"Poor man, they'll give him a stroke one of these days."
Selim!
But I'll get that newspaper shut down.
That'll teach them.
"Of course, you have the power to do anything."
You wouldn't move a finger in the first place if the Yaşarans weren't also in it.
"- You're the one cleaning up their mess, aren't you?"
- Look mister...
I told you a thousand times already...
"I went to help the girl, because the town folks asked me to."
And I helped her without expecting anything in return.
"Unlike you, I didn't turn my back on her."
"And if this news was right then you'd be the one  who really abandoned her, am I wrong?"
You did the right thing though.
Everyone went their own way now.
And that chapter's over.
"It was that girl, wasn't she?"
She was there at the night of engagement.
You're talking nonsense.
I am Fatmagül Ketenci's yenge.
Was her yenge there to ask about her?
You were acting so weird all night.
"For God's sake Selim, just tell me, is it true?"
Are you crazy?
How can you believe that rubbish?
This is how much you trust me?
Are you serious?
I can't believe you.
No...
This is unacceptable.
You can't ask me that.
"Look, Meltem...This is over, if you don't believe me."
We gave people material for 5 years of gossip.
Does it hurt?
Slowly...
"Easy, easy..."
Slowly...
I can go on my own..
Okay.
I don't have a white horse but I saved you with my white car.
I am ready to help you whenever you want.- Thanks again!
"Use your mind, don't be stupid as me."
"It doesn't matter if he is handsome, tall..."
The important thing for one man is to have so much money that it would not end because of his stupidity.
This is my number.
Don't lose it please!
Let me know how you are.I will be worried...
"Okay, Thank you."
"Otherwise your life will pass decreasing, you look and you see that youth belongs to the past..."
Are you better sweetie?- I am very well.
I elicited to the girl.
"I told her she two faced hypocrite and so on... she took care of her friend all night, my flower."
She called me unbalanced...
"""Unbalanced"" ."
My sweetie.
"She is very beautiful ,even when she gets angry..."
Don't!
Open it!
Don't close it!
I'll lick the window and you will have to clean it again.
Don't do it man!
Eylül calling.
Yes.- I came to the building today but you took flights.
I got your phone number from the foreman.
He????
Who am I???
"I am your husband, Narin!!!"
"Even if you won't do your wifely duty, I still acted as a husband towards you."
Don't touch me!
What's my fault?
Eh???
What's my fault?
It's been over two months since we got married.
I did whatever you wanted.
Whatever you wanted.
"Get up, get up... sit.. sit..."
It's enough!!!!
"What do you think I am, eh???"
What do you think I am?????
"I am supposed to shut up over everything, accept everything, and you all twist me around your fingers, eh???"
"There is no such world, Narin."
There is no such world.
"From now on, we are going to live as man and wife."
Everyone is going to know their place.
I am your husband.
"Mustafa... you can fool everyone, but.."
"I won't fall for your act, son..."
"I understand you.. if you have anything you want, tell me... relax.."
Don't worry yourself over it..
"If he needs anything, Neco is here.."
"But, when one sits around all day like a potato, they don't have any needs, right?"
It's enough to give a little fertilizer...
"Ah, now I believe you!"
If you won't stuff this man's words back into his mouth.. ... you are not aware of anything...
"If I wasn't too embarrassed, I swear to God, I would cry."
It troubles me so much.
Shall we marry with out any delay
let us recreate history and show that.. ..our union is a proof of real friendship
I will never remove you from my heart . ..and this ring from my finger.
You should also promise me one thing.
Whenever it rains you should come and hug me like this.
My God!
From where did you get that heroine?
Shall we watch the shooting?
Why not?
Let us go.
"Sir, see this girl!"
How beautiful she is!
If we make her the heroine in our movie.. ..it will definitely go on to celebrate a silver jublee.
You are right director.
She looks wonderful.
Hey photographer!
Take a few snaps .. ..of that girl in the pink dress.
Look here Mr.Ranga Rao!
We never know when luck will smile on someone.
For example Simran became a heroine.
Her mother is moving around in a Benz car.
Roja also became a heroine. - Her brother too has a Benz car.
Same thing with Rambha too.
Her mother is moving around in Benz car.
You are talking only about brothers and mothers.
What about fathers?
- He is there.
And you are that person if you agree.
Listen to me and make your daughter a heroine.. ..then you will get not only Benz cars .. ..but you can enjoy all other luxuries.
You can earn some crores of money.
Crores!?
Yes believe me.
- And I gave all my money to the taxi.
- Why are you doing dangerous stuff like that?
You're seeking trouble.
They could have seen you.
I can't bear the longing for my child.What can I do?
"Okay, this pregnancy really made you nervy.You better do something about it quickly."
I will.
Don't worry.
"I can come with you, to the doctor if you want."
"- Okay.- This week, I'll be a bit busy with work though."
"We can go next Thursday, okay?I'll be busy till then."
Which day of month is next Thursday?
Let me see...It's 8th today.
16th it will be.
16th...
"Don't waste time, if you ask me.Let us go and take care of it next week."
"Neither before you, nor after you."
"Fatmagül, shall we dance?Let us dance."
How sweet of you.
#Oh the separation.
Stronger than even death.
#Time stops flowing.
"#Neither my loved ones, nor the sweet memories are enough anymore."
"Abla, shall we dance?In honor of Fatmagül's birthday."
# I'm caught up in your love.
# I stole from my own life.
"- Let us dance as well.- No, baby."
You know this is not my type of song.
"# Travelling around the seven worlds,"
# I have yet to find a remedy.
Tonight is doing good for all of us.
- It made Fatmagül so happy.- I wish her to be always happy.
Don't blame others for your own sin.
We don't want any of you here.
- It is hard enough to contain Mustafa...
- Are you threatening me?
- We're just saying...
"- Okay, go back to your own business."
Let us go inside.
I can't believe it.
I really can't.
They nearly lynched me today in the town.
I bet it's the pig called Reşat who let those men on us.
I bet.
Do everything to prevent this news to reach the national newspapers.
People might believe it.
"Münir will sue them, of course."
But you should pressure them as well.
Your food.
I pity this country if people like them can freely write their fabricated lies.
- He's not picking up.
- That's better.
A crazy man throws a stone in a well...
Please sort it out.
- Where you going?
- To meet my father for visa procedures.
"Okay, I'll call Mustafa Bey right away."
Let's see how we're gonna clean up this mess.
"Reşat Amca, I have a visa appointment."
I have to go.
"Okay, let our driver take you there."
- Where are you going?
"- I'm here, I'll tell the driver."
- I'll call you later.
What aunty?
You are praising me a lot?
The state is facing a drought.
People have stopped giving loans.
And they are unjustly asking me to repay their money too.
Since there was no one else I came back thinking that.. ..my mother in law is my only refuge.
Am I wrong?
You will always do this.
Do you know that you have a marriageable daughter?
First address that issue.
Ha!
Ha!
My daughter is a princess.
Some prince will definitely come for her.
He will give me half of his kingdom as dowry to marry her.
This is ancient tradition and is not wrong.
"My dear, I know that you made fish curry."
Serve it to me.
What happened?
"Boss, the girl is here, in Warangal."
"Hey, cant you see what is happening?"
Cant you wait?
You continue speaking.
Her father is a useless man.
Throughout the day he indulges in drink.. ..playing cards and spends all his time at the club.
There is no habit he doesnt have.
It will be very easy to manage him.
"Uncle, for the first time in my life"
I had the desire for marriage.
And that was after seeing her.
Handle this case carefully.
Give the money.
- Yeah.
You were so hilarious in that olive costume.
"But, Jas, you said boys don't rate girls for funniness."
"Well, I just meant that they rate other things more."
"Oh, yeah."
What do they rate then?
Skinny-Minnie blondie boobie girly girls like Slaggy Lindsay?
"Well, she does have that cover-girl look that boys die for."
"So, are you saying I have to be more like her?"
Thong alert!
I always knew she was from Vulgaria.
- Now that's what boys like.
- But they just go up your bum.
- Nah.
- Do you think you should try one?
No way.
I'm not gonna injure myself just because boys like it.
And Slaggy Lindsay should know that all those ancient women did not burn their bras and give women the vote so she could wear a thong.
What a swiz!
- That is just diabolical.
"- No, that is shocking."
Bet you Robbie doesn't know about that.
At least I sort of fill up my bra when I wear one.
Even though it does bunch up when I run for the bus.
"So, she has false boobs, a massive bum and a blank personality."
You would score more in all of those areas.
Defo.
But she's got Robbie and I haven't even kissed a boy.
I can't.
"You want to move up on the maturity scale, right?"
I'm not that desperate.
You have to step up to compete.
So you won't stray again.
What you have to understand is that the church and the state are the parents of the motherland.
That requires a sense of responsibility... and deserves respect.
You people don't respect anything so we have to take a hard line.
Nobody cares that you're here.
Your family and friends don't give a shit about you.
You won't get out of here alive.
I won't let you.
"And even if you did, I'd come find you."
I'd come find you.
You're cracking really fast.
This isn't happening!
You can't hurt me!
I can't hurt you?
No!
"What I just did, didn't that hurt?"
"Dad, please..."
It's me...
Malena.
I know you remember.
Please.
Don't hurt me anymore.
You know what?
Maybe you're right.
Remember the story of Abraham?
"No, you wouldn't."
"God told Abraham to kill his son, lsaac, and Abraham didn't hesitate for a second."
He looked at his son and saw an enemy he had to wipe out.
"He took him to the mountain top, drew a knife to cut his throat... and just when he was going to do it.."
God told him to stop.
"If I'm your father as you say, then God should tell me to stop."
Shall I tell you a secret?
We need to find the recorder and prove the murder.
The left minister and the others are planning to find the truth.
All we need is to find the proof to assist them.
Who are you fellows?
How dare you come...
They all committed a sin of treason.
Arrest all of them.
Who are you fellows?
How dare you come...
They all committed a sin of treason.
Arrest all of them.
Yes sir.
Treason?
"Yoon-jungho, you bastard!"
Aren't you afraid of the heavens?
Now that heaven has changed.
Boo-won Goon (the queen's father's title) come out!
You are under arrest.
What's the matter?
He has committed a sin of treason.
It's an order from the Queen Mother.
How dare you make a loud noise here?
Go away!
Over there.
Catch him.
Take him away.
This red color is made by dipping the cloth in a mixture of flower petals.
It takes hundreds of dippings to make such a vibrant red.
"This red is the color that melds all the other  colors, which signifies the color of a King."
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
Our duty is not to be part of politics.
That man isn't the real killer.
You were the one who got him caught.
And now you want to clear his name?
A man appears out of no where to save Barış from the suspicions.
Ferhat's lighter found on him?
"Come on, that's not just a coincidence."
They just want us to think that way.
The man was following me just to get caught.
"So, you're saying that Barış hired that man?"
Exactly...
Barış took action when he felt he was cornered.
First he wanted to silence us to buy some time.
That's why he said he would sue us all.
And then he made his plan.
He made that man get caught.
So that he would confess the murder.
So simple...
"See, that man isn't the real killer."
All this was setup by Barış.
Or maybe Kuzey did it.
Just when Kuzey went into jail... ... a man confesses the murder to clear Kuzey's name.
Kuzey wouldn't do a sham like that.
If the killer is one of Bekir's men... ... he might have sacrificed himself to save Kuzey.
Can't that be possible?
You have this disease for how long?
Since my son died.
The doctors said it is at a progressed stage.
- You didn't get treatment?
- No.
- Why?
- Killing that man was my treatment.
Did you kill Ferhat?
He is escaping !
You take the short cut.
You take the long cut.
Go!
I won't spare him!
My cycle!
- I won't spare him!
Where am I skating?
My pajama !
I won't spare you !
Where is he hiding?
My name is Gorpade.
I have felled big time goons.
Manish is not here.
"Don't worry, Manish will come with the diamonds."
Where is Hira ( diamond)?
"- Sir, I am here."
"Not you, where is the diamond thief?"
Where are you going?
I saved my life with great difficulty.
"Nowadays, guns are fired somewhere, and bombs are blasted somewhere."
"It was difficult to live before ; nowadays, it is difficult to survive."
"That is why I am telling you my love, get married soon, have a honeymoon. . . sire children."
- You are always joking.
"No Shalu, if you get separated from me, what will you do?"
"Will you toss in bed, or sigh?"
- Neither!
"I'll just write love letters to you round the clock. "" If ever you get separated from me, what will you do? """
""" Will you toss in bed, or sigh? """
""" I will neither toss in bed, nor sigh """
""" I will just write love letters to you round the clock """
""" If ever you get separated from me. . . """
"Because Faruk is lying,... because Faruk is an unreliable man."
"Ah,Selim..-An hour long he was droning ""No i'm not a thief,no the business went wrong ""... ..."
"""No, don't worry , when i get the money, i'll pay back..."""
""" Is it not so?"
Couldn't he tell this on the phone?
He wanted to talk face to face - And with it we are alright !
"Again, he wanted to ask for money from you.. and when he saw me, gave up that idea."
And he is taking me for a fool... as i don't understand his mind..
Again he did a wrong calculation.
He couldn't guess we would come together of course.
"It 's enough now, Selim.- And you, if I were not there when he called you, would you tell me? would you tell me come,we go together?"
He is even calling you to come to the hotel..Impertinent( Inappropriate.)
"What is there, he did not want to be seen."
"Anyway you're the lawyer of the other side, but don't forget a common friend of ours is in a very difficult situation."
"Okay, i know, you're right, see you."
"Yes, Burcu."
Okay i know i'm late.
I am on my way.
I am coming to the office.
What?...
"Oh, No..."
Which hospital?
"I am not crazy, I am not crazy man!"
I am not crazy.
Untie me!
"Find my lawyer, let my brother come to me."
"Man is okay, be quiet... - Leave me, i'm not crazy.."
Man i am not mad...
Leave me!
"Untie me ,i'm not crazy- Stop man, stop,they left.."
You will get mad by force!
Did they really inform my lawyer?-Yes they did..&amp;gt; Good...
"I said, ""I don't know."
"Why?"""
"And they said, ""It's really important."
"You gotta get it out of here."""
"So they talk to the pilot and aircraft commander and he came over and he said, ""Brian what do you think?"""
"Or, BJ, they called me."
"""Can you haul that thing?"""
"I was looking at it and there was a master sergeant there and stuff and said, ""What is it?"""
"He said, ""I can't tell you what's in it."
"But it has to be out of here, because they've having trouble..."""
That's that real hard area in Pakistan right now.
All the troubles and everything.
There were troubles back then.
"So, there was an old"
CG marked out with the circle and an X in it for
Center of Gravity.
"So, I said, ""Well, is that accurate?"""
"He said, ""Well, I don't know."""
"I said, ""Hey, listen, if you want me to haul it, I have to know pretty close because... the plane is big and touchy on this, you know."""
"He said, ""There's probably weight on both ends."""
"I said, ""What's it weigh?"""
"There was like 20-22,000 pounds on it."
"He said, ""We probably added a couple 3,000."""
"I said, ""Okay, I don't care what's in it."
You can have sugar in it.
I don't care what's in it.
"But I do have to know if it can hold it."""
"So he says that, so I said I can fly it - I can haul it."
We had a load of stuff.
We ran that stuff back down to
Karachi and then they'd ship it out there in boats and stuff like that.
Flew back up to
Pinto!
"- Yes, boss!"
The goods should be cleared from underwater tunnel.
Underwater tunnel ready!
- Go ahead!
Beware!
Hands up!
"Boss, our link with Jamal Pasha""s boat.. ..has got disconnected."
"And boss, we have received the red signal too."
Red signal?
What about the goods?
God!
I knew it!
That I will be ruined!
"Tiger singh.. what was the need.. ..to bring such a big consignment? shut up! congratulations, boss!"
The consignment is here!
Quickly open this! otherwise he will get a heart attack. very good! very good! very good! open it!
"That""s better!"
Tiger singh.. only gold! kaka sir!
Real gold!
I knew it!
"Tiger singh.. as long as you are there.. ..no harm can befall on these gold. seema has come. so this is your business, shekhar!"
How dare you! - seeing your illegal activities!
This is my business!
"lf this is your business, then shame on this business! shame on this luxurious life! seema, you have made a mistake by coming here!"
"Now don""t cross your limits!"
"When you have crossed your limits of humanity.. ..then why do I have to stay in my limits? shekhar, I could have never imagined that you will be like this!"
Now I know your true form.
Now I know why strange people come to meet you.
Because you do smuggling! - seema!
lf you had to be a traitor.. it would.. ..have been better if you had died!
Thanks a lot for this favour!
"I would be on Facebook, or worse,"

The volume of a cube is equal to its length times its width times its height.
"A cube with side x has length x, width x, and height x."
"So its volume is equal to x times x times x, or x to the third."
Shane takes a big cube of butter with side length 5 from the fridge.
"So I'm assuming-- well, they're not giving us the units."
Maybe it's 5 centimeters.
With side length 5 from the fridge.
Maybe I'll go with 5 centimeters.
That seems reasonable.
Then he cuts out a little cube of side length 2 from one of the corners of the cube.
Write an expression that describes the volume of butter left.
So let's think about it.
The original volume of butter that was-- they're saying side length 5.
I'm visualizing it as 5 centimeters.
"Its volume is going to be 5 times 5 times 5, which we could just write as 5 to the third power."
And then he takes out a little chunk from that.
And the volume that he takes out is the volume of that little cube.
And that little cube has side length 2.
So its volume is going to be 2 times 2 times 2.
Or another way of writing that is 2 to the third power.
So it's going to be 5 to the third minus 2 to the third.
Why are we doing this?
Where are we going?
Why?!
What?!
Oohh!
We're in Paris!
"Yes, exactly, why don't we just stop and enjoy it?"
Just look.
"Oh, I'm sorry to have bored you with such story."
[Seul Hye]
Do not worry.
I have heard nothing.
You've changed somewhat since I've seen you last.
"You were cold as stone last time, but now you're even smiling."
"Back then, there was a man I had my heart set upon."
"Even though I may seem to be cold, I have my integrity."
Back then?
You speak of it as if it were a thing from the past.
Yes.
He was someone who I could not be with.
"So, I ended things in a petty way."
Is that so?
"Then, you could stay by my side tonight, right?"
"Forgive me, but I already made a prior engagment."
A prior engagement?
Yes.
"A favor was done for me, thus I promised to return the favor by greeting him tonight."
You wench!
You're arrogant!
How dare you put excuses as greetings to disobey him when he's speaking?
That's fine.
It's her arrogance that intrigues me.
Seol Hye!
Come outside for a minute!
"Forgive me, it seems I am required."
Alright.
She's a geisha from the commoners.
"You can just order her, why are you just watching her?"
I don't know why.
"Somehow, I can't seem to give her up."
I will come with you.
- Let us go.
You dont worry baby.
Nothing will happen to him.
He is angry with me so he did not do.. .. the job I offered.
Ego problem.
And joined in this dirty job and now arrested.
As a man he should have some ego but not this much.
As your father I have to try something.
But how?
I have to fall at their feet.
I will directly talk with the home minister.
I think it is the correct idea.
Small influences will not work.
Since it is a terrorist case.
Hello!
Is it the home minister?
"Yes, this is home minister speaking."
What is the matter?
"Its me sir, Kona Ranga Rao."
My fellow is in trouble sir.
It will not be a big problem.
If you give the surety.. ..he can be released.
No problem.
When I said that my father arranged a job for you.. ..you laughed at me.
As a result we became the laughing stock.. .. for everyone.
A man should not have so much ego Venkat.
You are crazy.
You are fortunate to be released.
Otherwise what would have happened?
"Shailu, you dont understand."
This is the drama ploted by ..your father and that Bhadram to separate us.
"already here -- so that's one of column one,"
"that's one times column one, right there."
And now I want to add on --
so I'm going to hook the next vector onto the front of the arrow will
start the next vector and it will go this way.
"So let's see,"
can I do it right?
"If I added on one of these vectors,"
"it would go left one and up two, so we'd go left one and up two, so"
it would probably get us to there.
Maybe I'll do dotted line for that.
Okay?
"That's one of column two tucked onto the end,"
but I wanted to tuck on two of column two.
So that --
the second one -- we'll go up left one and up two also.
It'll probably end there.
And there's another one.
So what
I've put in here is two of column two.
Added on.
And where did I end up?
What are the coordinates of this
result?
What do I get when I take one of this plus two of that?
"I do get that, of course."
"There it is, x is zero, y is three, that's b."
That's the answer we wanted.
And how do I do it?
You see I do
it just like the first component.
I have a two and a minus two that
Gossip magazine:
Mister ASK left a broken heart behind him again.
Go straight on from here!
"We came until here but you didn't see anyone, if you want to meet any friend or something like that, I can wait or I can go..."
No thanks!
-Don't you have a friend or you don't want to meet with anyone?
I don't have friends.
To the left!
The guy from the meatballs place?
He is my brother's friend.
"Come on, jump out here!- Papa, at least you could drop me by the shop.."
Tell the master I will be back late from the test.
"I understood, you're going away again!"
"Man, get out, I am in a hurry.- Come on, go on, quick, quick.!"
Why did that boy upset you today?
He talked a bit rudely.
I don't like him that much.
Did he say something bad?&amp;gt; No.
Do you do it intentionally?&amp;gt; What?
"You say a thing, then you keep mum for a while.As if I make you talk by force."
You tell everything half...
It's because I have nothing to tell.
You saw my life... there is nothing else good except the meatballs.
You're doing an injustice.
"Err... you're not late for your lesson, are you?"
I still have time.
We fell again here...
"It's okay, no problem..."
Do you have lessons every weekday-Two days in a week.
There was a school you mentioned the other day... did you get an answer from it?
No Word from there.
But even if they don't accept me I won't be so surprised.
And we'll have to pay the scrap dealer.. ..to have this cleared.
Why pay?
"We'll give him one of the broken idols.. ..and say "" It appeared from the ground in Amarnath "" ."
"What are you saying, brother-in-law?"
You'll soon be bankrupt.
Do you know the losses you've incurred?
40 lakhs.
Goods worth 25 lakhs bought on credit.. ..and 15 lakhs spent on renovation last month.
40 lakhs?
Where did you get that kind of money?
We borrowed a part of the amount by mortgaging the house.
And I borrowed 10 lakhs from a friend.
And 5 lakhs from your own pocket.. ..for earning 18% interest.
"Pravin, you fool."
You didn't even ask me.
How will we arrange for such a huge sum?
There's hardly 30-40 thousand in the bank.
And we don't even have jewellery.
Sushila.
We'll manage.
- How?
Why don't you understand?
lf you hadn't spoken ill about the Lord.. ..He wouldn't have caused this earthquake.
His justice is silent.
Will you please stop preaching?
"You mean to say, that the Lord.. ..who doesn't exist, razed down my shop.. ..because I spoke ill about Him?"
"So, just to prove Himself.. ..he razed down just my shop in a fit of rage."
And if I still don't believe in Him.. ..he will make me incur more losses?
- Yes.
What yes?
I still don't believe in You?
I haven't incurred any loss.
That's what linear dependency means.
That one of them can be represented as a scalar multiple of the other.
"Well if this is true, then I can just substitute this back in for vi."
And what do I get?
I get c times vj-- which is just another way of writing vi because I assumed linear dependence.
That dot vj has got to be equal to 0.
This guy was vi.
This is vj.
They are orthogonal to each other.
But this right here is just equal to c times vj dot vj which is just equal to c times the length of vj squared.
And that has to equal 0.
They are orthogonal so that has to equal 0.
Which implies that the length of vj has to be equal to 0.
"If we assume that this is some non-zero multiple, and this has to be some non-zero multiple-- I should have written it there-- c does not equal 0."
Why does this have to be a non-zero multiple?
Because these were both non-zero vectors.
This is a non-zero vector.
So this guy can't be 0.
This guy has length 1.
"So if this is a non-zero vector, there's no way that I can just put a 0 here."
Because if I put a 0 then I would get a 0 vector.
So c can't be 0.
"So if c isn't 0, then this guy right here has to be 0."
And so we get that the length of vj is 0.
Which we know is false.
The length of vj is 1.
This is an orthonormal set.
The length of all of the members of B are 1.
So we reach a contradiction.
This is our contradiction.
Vj is not the 0 vector.
It has length 1.
Look not for the permanence of job but of love.
Listen to me and apologize to him.
What about our parents?
It is you who have to live together.
Not your parents.
Go quickly.
If you delay then he may not accept you.
Why are you still thinking?
Go now.

But to tell you that I will live or die with you only.
Stop there.
What are you doing with my son now?
Have you gone mad?
What was the need for you to go to him?
I will bring a much better boy for you than him.
Get who ever you can.
But this marriage will never happen.
I wont agree for this marriage even if you fall at my feet.
Stop it.
Our marriage will take place.
We are not concerned with your standoff.
Our love is important for us.
She realized her mistake and.. ..apologized me.
Now if I bow to your adamancy.. .. then I will lose her forever.
Whether or not you agree we are going to marry.
Will you not shed your anger over me?
How can I bare that anger?
Stop your acting I will not surrender to you
Show some mercy on your girl who approached you
Does our paths ever combine?
Please stop your angry scolding
"- Zeynep, I almost died today."
"- Don't be silly, Burak."
How would he know that you'd use the elevator at that time?
- I don't know but he just did it somehow.
- Stop torturing yourself.
Throw those thoughts out of your mind.
I wish this was just my paranoias as you say.
I know you're going through a difficult period.
But you need to calm down.
It will be over soon.
I am with you.
And no one is gonna kill you.
Are you carrying a gun on your belt?
- I need to be prepared for anything.
- So is this how you protect yourself?
I need to carry this until I can feel safe again.
"""Kuzey, I crossed out one more day."""
"""I shoed away one more day to be with you."""
My captivity is over.
Yours is next.
On 4th of February.
"A new page will be opened for us, you'll see."
I'm filing a divorce suit against Barış.
"I'm with my mom, since that day."
"I won't go to that house again, not even to get my necklace back."
"Yes, Barış was so mad he seized the necklace you gave me."
I tried to get it back.
"But I had to leave it as pawn in exchange for my freedom, until I divorce."
It's a miserable effort by him.
"He will see that nothing can separate you and me, as everyone else will also see."
"Until today, I didn't know what it really meant ""to miss somebody""."
I missed you so much.
So let me do that.
So let me connect the dots as best as I can.
"This should be a line, not a curve."
"My hand isn't 100% steady, but I think you get-- let me do it a little bit better than that."
I think I can do a better job than that.
Let me draw-- that's even worse.
All right.
Last attempt.
That's throwing me off.
So last attempt right here.
There you go.
So that's that first line right there. y is equal to 3x plus 1.
So let me do the second one now.
"So it's written in standard form right now, 2y plus 4 is equal to 6x."
"We want to get this in slope-intercept form, y is equal to mx plus b."
So a good place to start could be to subtract this 4 from both sides.
So it goes on the other side.
So let's subtract 4 from both sides of this equation.
"The left-hand side, we're left with just a 2y, and then the right-hand side becomes 6x minus 4."
So 2y is equal to 6x minus 4.
"And then to get everything in terms to solve for y, we just have to divide everything by 2."
"So let's divide everything by 2, and we get y is equal to 3x minus 2."
So that's the second equation in slope-intercept form.
So same drill here.
The y-intercept is negative 2.
"So we go-- that's negative 1, negative 2 right there, and its slope is 3."
And notice its slope is the same as the other line.
So it's going to have the same inclination.
"If we move 1 in the x-direction, we move up 3 in the y-direction."
"1, up 3."
Just like that.
"If we go back 1 in x, we go down 3."
Because.
But yeah.
"Uh, we're thinking."
Okay.
"You kno w, as."
"Responsive design, it's kind of a buzzword but it is also a necessity."
"Um, and..."
"And lot of designers are now saying, well, everything I design, by default has to be responsive."
And now it's fine when you're starting fresh.
"But um, when you have to look behind you what's already been done since, you know, in a lot of cases."
Your content.
The content you are working with has existed since the beginning of internet.
And things were not pretty then.
Oh no.
"In fact, we still have sites that look like 1993."
"And that was my biggest, even iii..."
"Ah, I have no doubt."
"But we're not going to redesign another 1993 looking website with all those blocks and squares. we gotta get away from that, please."
Yeah.
To try to be a little more hip.
"In fact, the girl was just showing us ."
"We, we were looking at, um, presentation on the"
"Tuesday on of the pages that they had ah, doing test on."
"And, and that was one of the web comments there."
"I said, yeah, yeah."
"You don't have to stick with those 1995. , Mm-hm."
"No. , I said, oh no, is he? see how terrible we are."
"We are like the, we've got to get, we've got to get this stuff."
"I mean, they have some of the coolest science around and they show it and."
And those interval waves sometimes.
"I mean, our site looks pretty good."
"Um, cause we did the redesign at MPS and stuff."
SO its 2 times 2 minus 3 times 4
SO that's 4 minus 12.
"So its -8i minus, remember we have to swap signs, plus-minus-plus when you are taking the determinant."
"So you ignore the j, so its 4 times 2 = 8 minus 3 times 3 which is -1."
So this would be a -1 here but there is already a negative here so its a +1j.
"And then finally the k, you cross out that column."
4 times 4 is 16.
16 -6 =10.
So plus 10.
Let me be sure I got that correct.
"So the first one, I always have to make sure, so i I got yup, 4-12 = -8 and negative j ... 4 times 2 is 8 minus 9 = -1 but j has a negative so that's right."
"And then k, 4 times 4 is 16."
16 -6 = 10.
So that looks right.
So plus...plus 10k.
So this vector right here is the vector d.
I just figured it out.
"Now if we take the cross product of d with vector a the vector that was....you can kinda view it as lying along this line over here, then we will get a vector that is normal to this plane."
"We can call that vector n, for normal, that is normal to this yellow plane that will actually sit on this white plane."
"So lets figure it out, we will see in a few steps, probably in the next video why is that actually useful."
"So lets take, lets find what is d cross a... this is equal to our normal vector which is = same thing. i..j...k."
"We are gonna take d which is -8, 1, 10 and take the cross of that and vector a which is 2,3,4. and we will get, actually, I will continue this in the next video so that I do not make these videos too long."
- Her Grace is gone.
Find her.
- My lady.
"- You men, with me."
- Sir.
"So, she's definitely left the palace?"
"Yes, sir."
We saw her guards ourselves.
Get me more details.
Sir.
"I say, ""Time out."
"Stop."""
"You guys know the show, we use take one, we don't do take two."
"There's no writing, there's no scripting, there's no nonsense."
"We don't fool around, we don't rehearse -- we shoot what we get!"
"I said, ""Stop."
"This is nuts."""
"I mean, you know."
(Laughter)
"""This is crazy."
"We can't do this."""
"And Albert's like, ""What?"""
"And I'm like, ""I don't know what just happened, but there are testicles in this bucket and that's not how we do it."""
"And he said ""Well, that's how we do it."""
"And I said, ""Why would you do it this way?"""
"And before I even let him explain,"
"I said, ""I want to do it the right way, with the rubber bands."""
"And he says, ""Like the Humane Society?"""
"And I said, ""Yes, like the Humane Society."
"Let's do something that doesn't make the lamb squeal and bleed -- we're on in five continents, dude."
"We're on twice a day on the Discovery Channel -- we can't do this."""
"He says, ""OK."""
He goes to his box and he pulls out a bag of these little rubber bands.
"Melanie picks up another lamb, puts it on the post, band goes on the tail, band goes on the scrotum."
"Lamb goes on the ground, lamb takes two steps, falls down, gets up, shakes a little, takes another couple steps, falls down."
"I'm like, this is not a good sign for this lamb, at all."
"Gets up, walks to the corner, it's quivering, and it lies down and it's in obvious distress."
"And I'm looking at the lamb and I say, ""Albert, how long?"
"When does he get up?"""
"He's like, ""A day."""
"I said, ""A day!"
"How long does it take them to fall off?"""
"Okay, so put some ones down here."
This is the last n-by-n block.
"Put some ones there, and this is N plus one down."
Put it there.
Put it there.
"So let's put these 1's down, cuz it's easy."
Then we'll work on these last four.
Everybody good with that?
Okay.
"We'll start this back up, we can have the lights back down, mood lighting."
"There we go, so first of all I guess we'll have to do that, get rid of that seven."
So first let's go ahead and put in those 1's.
So first of all we have -four on the diagonal not one.
"Second of all, we have 1's on the edges."
"We have a, two 1's out there, and then we have two ones over here."
"And what do they, where are they located?"
"Well, the two, if you look at what we did here, and at my notation this at, all the way at negative N, minus M. And this is it, minus M."
"And is five, this is, so there are four by 4s that are sitting inside of these things, right."
"Cause I picked five points, but really it's the interior four that matter, okay."
Alright.
And then over here I have M and N minus M. If I do a spy on that.
Here's what I got so far.
Look at that.
Kinda nice.
Laying down some diagonals.
Everybody cool with that?
Alright.
I've laid down the easy ones.
"So, so what I'm working with is the M I picked is how many points I'm going to happen this way and this way."
"So, right?"
"I have five points, but remember the last point is the same as the first so it's really and four."
"That's why I come down here and say, I have a four by four block right here, and at the fifth location, I drop this."
So it has this four pattern.
"So can we come up with any term that is a multiple of 4, what is our value?"
Well at 4 our value is minus 3.
What's the next multiple of 4?
8.
At 8 our value's minus 3.
So in general-- and if we did 12 we'd also get minus 3.
If you don't believe me you should try it out.
"So at any multiple of 4, we know our value is minus 3."
"So what I do is, they want to know the 55th term."
So what term is a multiple of 4 that's closest to 55?
"Let's see, is 56 a multiple of 4?"
Yeah.
56-- that's 10.
"14 times 4 is 56, right?"
"So the 56th term, we know the 56th term because 56 is a multiple of 4, just like 4 and 8 and 12."
So the 56th term-- I have trouble saying that.
Maybe I have a little lisp.
"56th term is negative 3, right?"
Because it's a multiple of 4.
"If the 56th term is negative 3, what is the 55th term?"
"Well the term before the negative 3 term is always the negative 5 term, right?"
"Up here, negative 3?"
It's always negative 5.
"So the answer is negative 5 is the 55th term, and that is choice A."
Very good.
"All right, let's move on to the next question."
"I know that one's a little hard, and those you always just have to experiment a little bit, try to see the cycle, and then make sure you have your terms right."
You know that you're starting on the first term as opposed to the 0 term.
And then figure out what the easiest value is as close what they're asking as possible and then you can kind of move backwards or forwards.
That's how I do it.
That's so you don't get too confused with the shifts on the terms.
Now sit aside.
We do not speak to drunkards at all.
I am a drunkard but not a hen-pecked husband.
How dare you say that to me?
Did you see what he said about you?
I am observing you since some time.
Why are you getting aggressive?
There the ladies have entered the arena.
You too enter the fray.
What are you ranting?
We agreed for this marriage.. ..since we did not know that you are worthless people.
See this sari that you presented.
Please do not tear the sari.
That sari is more than enough for your status.
"Madam, past is past."
Please keep quiet now.
"Who are you to speak in between, you bald fellow?"
How dare you speak to me like that?
If not a bald fellow we will call you a rotten fellow.
"Teacher, bald is better than rotten."
Oh!
Is that so?
Why dont you say loudly so that all can hear?
All of you please listen!
"My teacher is bald, not rotten."
"My dear bride, why dont you patch up for what happened.. ..by saying sorry to the groom once?"
You shut up.
Will a sorry nullify everything they did?
"Look sir, will you accept it if the girl you love insults you.. ..in front of all and then say sorry?"
I will not.
Every time this bus puncture at this place.
Is this a hotel?

"Most compact stars are at the end of their stellar evolution. They are called stellar remnants: the form of the remnant depends mainly on the mass of the star when it formed. These objects are small for their mass. Astronomic objects with an unknown nature are often called ""compact star"", when evidence suggests that they are very massive and that they have a small radius. A compact star which is not a black hole is sometimes called a degenerate star."

Battle of Guam (1944)
"The Second Battle of Guam (July 21 — August 10, 1944) was the capture of Guam by the United States from Japanese control. Guam was a U.S. territory (in the Mariana Islands). The battle was during the Pacific campaign of World War II."
Background.
Guam is the largest island of the Marianas. It is 30 miles (48 km) long and 9 miles (14 km) wide. It had been a United States island since its capture from Spain in 1898.
"It was captured by the Japanese on December 10, 1941. This was after the Attack on Pearl Harbor. It was not as fortified as the other Mariana Islands, such as Saipan."
The Allied plan for the invasion of the Marianas was for heavy bombing by planes and then bombing by battleships.
"Guam was chosen as a target because it was big enough to be a base for the next attacks on the Philippines, Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands. The harbor at Apra could take the largest ships. The two airfields were big enough for B-29 Superfortress bombers."
"The invasion of Saipan was planned for June 15, 1944, with landings on Guam planned for June 18."
A large Japanese carrier attack and heavy fighting in Saipan led to the invasion of Guam being delayed for a month.
Battle.
"Guam is surrounded by reefs, cliffs, and heavy waves. This makes Guam hard to attack."
"On July 21, the Americans landed on both sides on the western side of Guam. The 3rd Marine Division landed at 08:28. The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade landed to the south. Japanese artillery sank 20 Landing Ships. The Americans had many dead and wounded."
By 09:00 men and tanks were on both beaches. The 77th Infantry Division had to walk through the shallow water. Japanese guns fired at them.
"By nightfall the Americans controlled the beachs about 2,000 meters deep. Japanese attacks were made throughout the first few days."
"Lieutenant General Takeshi Takashina was killed on July 28, and Lieutenant General Hideyoshi Obata took over the command of the defenders."
Supply was very difficult for the Americans in the first days of the battle.
"The attacks against the American beaches, as well as the violent fighting, had tired out the Japanese. At the start of August they were running out of food and ammunition and had only a few tanks left."
Obata moved to the mountainous central and northern part of the island. He could not get any more supplies or get new troops because of American control of the sea and air around Guam.

"The LM was the last of the Apollo “hardware” to be developed. Its start had been delayed while NASA made up its mind to take the lunar-orbit meeting approach and thus require a vehicle like the LM for a landing. A contract with the prime builder was signed on January, 1963, almost two years after the Apollo project began. The LM was tested several times in space. Finally, on July 20, 1969 the Apollo 11 LM Eagle made the first manned lunar landing."

"To land on the moon, the descent engine would be fired to begin the LM’s drop from out in lunar orbit down toward the moon. LM could descend vertically and hover above the surface of moon. After the two men finished their stay on the surface, the ascent stage, sitting on the descent stage, would use its ascent engine firing to lift itself off the moon."

Pollinator
"A pollinator is an animal that does pollination. Pollination is almost entirely done by insects, though there are some exceptions. Some birds (such as hummingbirds) pollinate flowers as they take nectar. Overall, however, it is insects that pollinate. Bees, of course, pollinate flowers as they take nectar. But wasps, ants, flies, beetles, butterflies and moths all have many species which are pollinators. The plant which offers the pollen is called the ""pollenizer""."
"To be a pollinator, an insect has to move pollen from the male anther to the female stigma of a flower. The pollinator gets away with much of the pollen for its own use."
"Although it is obvious that flowering plants are the plants which usually offer pollen, there is a pre-history of pollination in cycads."
"Bees may not be the most numerous insects which take up the pollen. Hoverflies (Syrphidae) are very numerous visitors to flowers, and they may be more numerous than bees in many environments."
"The list of pollinators is long. Bees, wasps, ants, flies, mosquitoes, lepidoptera and beetles all have some pollinators who take nectar, and also some vertebrates: bats, birds, monkeys, lemurs, possums, rodents."
"Wild pollinators often visit many plant species, and plants are visited by many pollinator species. All these relations together form a network of interactions between plants and pollinators. Surprising similarities exist in the networks of interactions between plants and pollinators. This structure is similar in very different ecosystems on different continents, consisting of entirely different species."

Symptoms.
"Most people with bulimia eat large amounts of food then make themselves vomit or purge. Typically, they will do this at least once a week or more often. Bulimic people often think about how their bodies look, and usually, the motive behind purging is the want to be skinny. The person may also have anorexia nervosa. However, most with bulimia have a normal weight or are overweight, which makes it difficult to know when someone has bulimia from just simply looking at them. It is also common to have calluses or bruising on the fingers from purging."
"Tak'alik A'baj' is an ancient ruin in Guatemala; it used to be called Abaj Takalik. It is one of several Mesoamerican sites that have Olmec and Maya features. The site was inhabited the during the Preclassic and Classic periods, from the 9th century BC through to at least the 10th century AD. It was an important place for trade. It traded with Kaminaljuyu and Chocolá. It is one of the largest sites with carved monuments on the Pacific coast. Olmec-style sculptures include a possible colossal head, rock carvings and others. The site has one of the biggest collections of Olmec-style sculpture outside of the Gulf of Mexico."
Takalik Abaj shows the first signs of Maya culture that happened by about 400 BC. The site includes a Maya royal tomb and examples of Maya writing that are among the first from the Maya region. Studies continue at the site; the monumental buildings and long tradition of sculpture in a variety of styles suggest the site was important.
Finds from the site indicate contact with the distant city of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico. They imply that Takalik Abaj was conquered by it or its allies. Takalik Abaj was linked to long-distance Maya trade routes that let the city take part in a trade network that included the Guatemalan highlands and the Pacific coastal plain from Mexico to El Salvador.
"Takalik Abaj was a large city with the main buildings in four main groups spread across nine terraces. While some of these were natural, others were man-made, needing a lot of work and materials. The site had a clever water drainage system and many stone sculptures."

Scram
"A scram or SCRAM is a quick shutdown of a nuclear reactor. It is done in an emergency (a dangerous situation). A scram is performed by quickly inserting all of the control rods, or, if this fails, injecting boric acid into the reactor. A reactor that has been shut down still requires cooling due to decay heat. If the cooling system fails, the core can still melt down even if the reactor has been shut down. This has happened during several nuclear accidents, including Three Mile Island and Fukushima. The RBMK reactors used in the Soviet Union had graphite-tipped control rods, a design flaw which caused the reactivity to increase for a moment when the reactor was scrammed. This design flaw contributed to the Chernobyl disaster."

The fraudster then asks for personal information, such as a home address and bank account numbers. Instead of giving an item, the fraudster takes their money. Fraudsters often target senior citizens."
Fraud is a criminal wrong: a fraudster may be prosecuted and imprisoned. It is also a civil wrong: a fraud victim may sue the fraudster to get compensation.
"All societies have laws against fraud, but the details differ in each jurisdiction. In England an Act of Parliament defines three kinds of fraud."
Lesser cases are heard in a Magistrates' Court; more serious offences are tried in the High Court (jury proceedings).

Its capital is Mbabane. The country is named after the 19th-century king Mswati II. Eswatini was colonized by the British and the Boers at the end of the 19th century.
Eswatini is a small country. It is no more than north to south and east to west. It is completely surrounded by land. Eswatini does not touch the sea. The two countries that touch it are Mozambique and South Africa. The country's two largest cities are the administrative capital Mbabane and the economic center Manzini. The seat of government is Lobamba.
"On 19 April 2018, the King of Eswatini Mswati III announced that the Kingdom of Swaziland had renamed itself the Kingdom of Eswatini."
Health.

Sepal
Sepals are one of the four basic parts of a flower. They are found below the petals.
"The sepals are often small and green. Some flowers do not have petals. Then the sepals may be big and colorful. In some flowers, the petals and sepals look the same. They are both called tepals."
All the sepals together are called calyx.
The number of sepals is different for different flowers. Both petals and sepals surround the reproductive parts inside the flower. The term for sepals plus petals is the perianth.
The main job of the sepals is to keep the parts of the flower safe before it opens.They are usually green and leaf-like
Cotyledon
"A cotyledon, or seed leaf, is a leaf that is stored in a seed. When the seed sprouts, the cotyledons are the first leaves that the plant has. Monocot plants have only one cotyledon, and other plants have two. Cotyledons often look very different from the other leaves, so they are not called true leaves."
"Plants use cotyledons to make sugars through photosynthesis. They use the sugars to keep true leaves growing. After a while, the cotyledons often die because the plant does not need them anymore."

Cobbs continues to act."
World line
"A world line is the unique path that an object has as it travels through both space and time, usually called spacetime. As we learn from special relativity, the faster an object goes, the more time slows down for that object. As you can see in the illustration to the right, the slower object has a quicker passage of time than the very fast object, the one which time passes much more slowly for. When an object reaches the speed of light, it will be zero on the ""t"" axis, meaning that it will have made no progress in the time direction. Basically, the world lines show that when the speed of light is reached, time stops for the observer. World lines are very often used in theoretical physics and special relativity, as well as general relativity."
Usage.
"The concept of world lines is used widely in theoretical physics, for it shows some interesting facts about high-speed motion. For example, the time dilation equation presented by Albert Einstein is algebraically undefined when an object's velocity is the speed of light, but using world lines one can find that when the speed is the speed of light, time will stop. Although Einstein's equation (for time dilation) does show that an object going faster than light goes backward in time, the same concept can be described using world lines."
Vase in the Form of a Phallus
"Vase in the Form of a Phallus is an ancient Greek terracotta vase in the form of a flaccid, uncircumcised, penis. The scrotum and pubic hair are depicted.

Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of getting coal out of the ground. It is part of the mining industry. Coal is used as a resource for making electricity.
Extraction.
Surface mining is done when the coal is near the surface. Coal miners remove the soil above the coal. The coal can then be removed without the coal miners having to go deep underground..
"Underground mining is when the coal is farther underground, making it too expensive to remove soil. In this process, coal miners and all of the coal mining equipment are brought deep underground and coal is carried up out of the ground. This is especially dangerous because of fires, explosions, and poison gas in coal mines."
Processing.
"Before coal can be used, it must be processed in a coal processing plant. It is made smaller using a sizer and crusher. Parts that might be harmful to any equipment which will use the coal later on, such as the screening for metallic parts inside the mined coal."
Delivery.

When he was captain of the aircraft carrier ""Theodore Roosevelt"", he noticed that some of his crew had caught COVID-19, a disease that affects the lungs and breathing. Late in March, 2020, he wrote letters asking for permission to send his sick sailors off his ship to Guam. These letters were found and printed in a newspaper. A few days later, the Navy fired Crozier as the captain of the ""Theodore Roosevelt"" but did not fire him from the Navy entirely."
"In late April, some leaders in the Navy asked that Crozier be reinstated and sent back as captain of the ""Theodore Roosevelt""."
Career.
"Brett Crozier is from Santa Rosa, California. He graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1992 and became a pilot for the Navy in 1994. He fought in Iraq in 2003. He later earned a Master's Degree in National Security and Strategic Studies at the Naval War College. He served in many different positions in the Navy, including Executive Officer of the ""USS Ronald Reagan"". Brett Crozier was captain of the ""USS Blue Ridge"" from June 2017 to November 2018."
Letters.
"He wrote more than twenty copies of a four-page letter, dated March 30, 2020. He addressed it to senior officials in the military. He asked for permission to send 1000 of his crew off the ship. The ship had more than 4000 people on it. Someone found his messages and they were printed in the newspaper ""San Francisco Chronicle"" on March 31, 2020."
"COVID-19 is very contagious, and people can catch it from other people easily. In the letter, Crozier said that the ship was too cramped to allow for sick sailors to do what the Centers for Disease Control and the Navy's own administration said people with COVID-19 should do: Keep away from other people for 14 days. He asked for permission to let his sick sailors go ashore to Guam, where the ship was docked at the time, and go into quarantine there instead of on board the ship. He copied part of a report about the ""Diamond Princess"" cruise ship, and said that even though the ""Diamond Princess""'s passengers had private rooms, more than 100 people still became infected. He said the ""Theodore Roosevelt"" only had a few private rooms."
"Retired Admiral James Stavridis, who used to be NATO Supreme Allied Commander for Europe, agreed that it was not possible to perform social distancing on board a navy ship like the ""Theodore Roosevelt""."
Firing.
High-ranking leaders at the Navy said that removing Crozier from his ship was normal. They said Crozier should have asked for help by going through the chain of command instead of writing letters to other people in the military.
"According to Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas B. Modly, Crozier's letter caused naval crews and their families to panic: ""It undermines our efforts and the chain of command's efforts to address this problem and creates a panic. And creates a perception that the Navy's not on the job, the government's not on the job."""
"According to ""The New York Times"", ""a Navy official familiar with the situation but not authorized to speak publicly about it said that the captain had repeatedly asked his superiors for speedy action to evacuate the ship."""
"Kathleen H. Hicks, who worked at the Pentagon years earlier under President Barack Obama, said that the Navy did have the legal right to fire Crozier but that it might have been a bad idea to do so because it might make sailors and leaders less willing to trust each other."

Batting (cricket)
"In the sport of cricket, batting is the act or skill of hitting the cricket ball with a cricket bat. It is done to score runs or prevent the loss of one's wicket."
"Any player who is currently batting is called a batter even if they are better in any other skills in cricket. Batters have to adapt to various conditions when playing on different cricket pitches, especially in different countries. A top-level batter has good reflexes, decision-making and strategy with excellent physical batting skills."
"During an innings two members of the batting side are on the pitch. The one facing the current delivery from the bowler is called 'the striker', while the other is the non-striker. When a batter is out, he is replaced by a teammate. This continues until the end of the innings or until 10 of the team members are out. After the batting of first team is over the other team gets a turn to bat."
"Batting tactics and strategy depends on the type of match being played. It also depends on the current state of play. Batters try to score many runs quickly without losing their wicket. To score quickly, risky shots must be played which increases the chances of batters being out. Batters’ safest choice is to guard the stumps but this may result in scoring fewer runs."
"As with all other cricket statistics, batting statistics and records are given much attention. It helps to know how effectively a batter is playing. The main statistic for batting is a player's batting average. This is calculated by dividing the number of runs he has scored by the number of times he has been out (dismissed)."

Laura Fraser
An IPv6 address can be long and this can lead to mistakes when typing them into the computer or writing them down. There are two ways in which an IPv6 address can be made shorter without leaving anything out:
DNS.
DNS stands for Domain Name System
"It is also called a service server, and is based on client server network architecture. Like a phonebook, it contains a database of public IP addresses."
Other versions.
"Versions before IPv4 were experimental and never widely used. Version 5 was used exclusively for the Internet Stream Protocol, which was also never widely used."
Eurasia
"Eurasia is the combined landmass of Europe and Asia in the northern part of Earth. It has the Atlantic Ocean on its west, and the Pacific Ocean to the east. The Arctic Ocean is to its north, and the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean to its south. It is the largest of the continents. Its name comes from adding the ""Eur"" from ""Europe"" to ""Asia"". It and Africa form a part of the world called ""Afro-Eurasia""."
"Some geographers say Eurasia is one continent, because Europe and Asia are mostly on the same tectonic plate and do not have a sea between them. The Ancient Greeks divided the world they knew into Europe, Asia and Africa. To them, the Aegean Sea was the division between the Balkan Peninsula in Europe and Asia Minor in Asia. North of the Sea of Marmara, the Greeks thought the lands on the western side of the Black Sea was Europe and the eastern side was Asia. The ancient Greeks did not know very much about the lands north of the Black Sea. Since Classical Antiquity, people have talked about Asia and Europe separately, so it is now a tradition to see them as two continents."
"Some other continents, which are not completely divided by sea, are joined together by a thin strip of land (called an isthmus). An example is North America and South America, which are connected by the Isthmus of Panama. Europe and Asia are not divided by a sea, nor by any isthmus."
"Outside of geological definitions, Eurasia also includes the Indian subcontinent and the Arabian Peninsula."
"Sometimes Eurasia is divided into West Eurasia and East Eurasia. Here, the dividing line is the Ural Mountains. West Eurasia includes Europe and the Middle East. Historians sometimes add North Africa to West Eurasia, because the Sahara Desert divides North Africa from Sub-Saharan Africa, and it is as difficult to cross as a sea. Also, North Africa is culturally linked to Europe by the Mediterranean Sea."
List of countries.
The OECD’s Eurasia activities involve 13 countries extending from the borders of the European Union to the Far East:
North Pole
The North Pole is the point that is farthest north on Earth. It is the point on which axis of Earth turns. It is in the Arctic Ocean and it is cold there because the sun does not shine there for about half a year and never rises very high. The ocean around the pole is always very cold and it is covered by a thick sheet of ice.
There is also a Magnetic North Pole. It is near the physical North Pole. A compass points toward the magnetic North Pole.
There is a star called the North Star (or Polaris) that is always in the sky above the North Pole. People can tell how far north they are by seeing how high the North Star appears in the sky.
Plural
"In linguistics, noun phrases have grammatical number. Plural is one kind of grammatical number. In English, plural noun phrases are counted as more or less than one (e.g., ""32 degrees, no bananas"", ""0.5 liters"", ""1.2 grams"", ""two times"", ""three fish"", ""20 mothers""). In contrast, a singular noun phrase usually refers to something that you would count as one only (e.g., ""one time"", ""a glass"", ""the sun"", ""my mother"", ""Jennifer""). Noun phrases that cannot be counted are also singular in English (e.g., ""water"", ""the meat"", ""some space"", etc.)."
"In many languages, a suffix (word ending) is added to a word to show that the word is plural. In English, the normal plural suffix ""i""s ""-s"" (e.g., ""cat"" is singular, and ""cats"" is plural)."
Plurals in English.
There are a number of exceptions:
"It is fair to say that most native English-speakers make mistakes in this area, which is one of the more troublesome aspects of English."
Other languages.
All European languages have plural forms. The suffix that is used in each language is different from the one that is applied to English nouns.
"In other languages, such as Chinese, Korean and Japanese, there is usually no plural ending."

Surinam horned toad
Ceratophrys is a genus of frogs. They are part of the family Leptodactylidae. They are also part of the subfamily Ceratophryinae. They are also known as South American horned frogs as well as Pacman frogs. This is because they look like the video game character Pac-Man.
Woomera Test Range
"The RAAF Woomera Test Range is a weapons testing facility in South Australia. It is run by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). It covers and area of , and is the world's largest weapons test facility on land. The range is a restricted area, called the Woomera Prohibited Area. The airspace above it is also restricted, and is called the Woomera Restricted Airspace."
"The range was originally set up as a place for the British to test missiles during World War II. The British asked to do weapons testing here (in the centre of Australia), because not many people lived there. A Commonwealth weapons design and test project, called the Australian-Anglo Joint Project, was signed in 1946. The range originally had an area of ."
"Between 1955 and 1963, the British ran a series of seven nuclear-weapon tests at Maralinga, then inside the range. The Joint Project ran until 1980, when the British withdrew from the program. The range is still used as a testing site by the Australian Defence Force. Access is leased to foreign militaries and private companies for their own testing of weapons."
It is named after the Dharuk word for a spear-thrower.
"Balgo, Western Australia"
"Balgo is a small community in Western Australia. It is surrounded by the Great Sandy Desert and the Tanami Desert. It is an Aboriginal community; the area is traditionally Kukatja country. There are also some Pintupi families living there, who were displaced in the 1950s and 1960s. Many of them came to live here from Papunya, including some of the original artists of the Papunya Tula movement. Many of them later left Balgo when Kintore and Kiwirrkurra were set up in the 1980s. In 2006, Balgo had about 460 people living there."
"Komatsu, Ishikawa"
"Komatsu is a city in Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan."

Charles Perkins
"Charles Nelson Perkins, AO, (16 June 1936 – 19 October 2000) was an Australian activist and Aboriginal leader. He was also a professional football player."
"Perkins grew up in Alice Springs. His mother was Arrernte, and his father was Kalkadoon. He later moved to Sydney, and graduated from the University of Sydney in 1965. He was the first indigenous Australian to graduate from a university."
"Perkins campaigned for Aboriginal land rights. In 1965, he was an important person in the Freedom Ride campaign, which aimed to raise public awareness of the standards of living, literacy and health conditions among the Aboriginal population. The group was famous for publicising acts of discrimination."
"Perkins was also important in the campaign for the referendum in 1967, which allowed Aboriginal people to be counted in censuses, and parliament to make special laws specifically for Aboriginal people. From 1969, Perkins worked as a public servant in the Ministry of Aboriginal Affairs. He was made permanent secretary of this department in 1981, which made him the first Aboriginal to become the permanent head of a federal government department. He served as secretary until 1988."

Ice candle is a kind of candle made from water. It is fantastical and looks like a lamp-shade. It has been made in cold areas in winter. It melts in a few days so we can enjoy it for a moment.
History.
"The Ice candle was first made in Shimokawa, Hokkaido. In Shimokawa, there are few days in a year when the temperature exceeds 30 degrees below freezing. So this town is known as extreme cold. The members of “Egg of Columbus”, which is a Town Development Idea Semester in Shimokawa, had thought about some ideas on how people enjoy a cold winter with snow. In 1985, they found a sentence, “...the flame moves in the ice block, it changes to the natural lamp-shade quickly, the flame in the natural and pale clear glass lights up in the garden fantastically...” This is from “Live in north literary calendar, Northern area column (Kita no kurashi saiziki, Hoppo-ken column)” written by Ryuichi Ito who was a professor of Hokkaido university of education. He wrote about the candle which is made by Scandinavian Finland children. The Egg of Columbus got some hints to create the Ice candle from that sentence. In 1986, the Ice candle was created. They put a wish for people to be able to spend winter happily in it. In 1987, the Ice candle was introduced on TV. From around that time, townspeople have made it at their own home. Now, the Ice candle is known by Japanese nationwide and loved by people living in cold areas."
How to make.
"To make the Ice candle, you need a bucket, water and a cold environment to freeze water."
"At night the temperature is under -16 degrees, put water into the bucket, then get it outside and through the night. Next morning, turn it upside down and take out the ice if the water has almost frozen. Flow outside the water which couldn’t freeze. Put a candle into the hole of the ice. Not to break it, treat it carefully."
"We can make it with our own original ideas. For example, the colors and the shapes. If you want to color it, you can use a food coloring or paints. If you want to make it differently, you can use a milk carton or a balloon instead of a bucket."
Ice candle festival.
"The Ice Candle Festival is one of the festivals which is held in winter. In this festival, the venue is illuminated by many Ice candles. The place of origin is also Shimokawa in Hokkaido. Two years later after the Ice candle appeared, the name of Shimokawa Winter Festival, which was already there, was changed to Ice Candle Festival. In this festival, the Ice candle was put not only at the venue but also at each house in the town. In total, about 7000 Ice candles were put in the town. In addition, people who go to the festival enjoy eating food outside while seeing the Ice candles. Now, the Ice Candle Festival is held in various places in Japan. Lake-Yamanakako Ice Candle Festival in Yamanashi prefecture and Mt. Nobeyama Plateau Ice Candle Festival in Nagano prefecture are also famous festivals."

Chess notation
"Chess notation is a method for writing down chess moves: after a player makes a move, both players write it down. This is compulsory in all organized chess events"
"The system must have these elements: the move number, the piece moved, the square it starts from (optional), the square it goes to, and other relevant information such as captures, and castles.&lt;ref name=""H/W""&gt;Hooper D. and Whyld K. 1992. ""The Oxford companion to chess"". 2nd ed, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;p275 There are other notations for recording positions."
"There have been ways of describing moves from quite early on. Manuscripts with move descriptions are known in Arabic (9th century) and from Europe (13th century).p275 These early notations are usually quite cumbersome; ""The pawn of the king forward two houses"".p229; 469; 848 This kind of notation is called ""descriptive"". In a descriptive notation each player describes squares from his own point of view, e.g. 1 P–K4 P–K4. A notation which uses labels for the ranks and files is called ""algebraic"". In this notation a square has only one label, e.g. 1 e4 e5."
Algebraic notation.
"The moves of a chess game are written down by using a special notation.Article 8 and Appendix E Usually algebraic chess notation is used. In algebraic notation, each square has one and only one name (whether you are looking from White's side of the board or Black's). Here, moves are written in the format of: abbreviation of the piece moved – file where it moved – rank where it moved. For example, Qg5 means ""queen moves to the g-file and 5th rank"" (that is, to the square g5). If there are two pieces of the same type that can move to the same square, one more letter or number is added to show the file or rank from which the piece moved, e.g. Ngf3 means ""knight from the g-file moves to the square f3"". The letter P showing a pawn is not used, so that e4 means ""pawn moves to the square ""e4""""."
"If the piece makes a capture, ""x"" is written before the square in which the capturing piece lands on. Example: ""Bxf3"" means ""bishop captures on f3"". When a pawn makes a capture, the file from which the Pawn left is used in place of a piece initial. For example: exd5 means ""pawn captures on d5."""
"If a pawn moves to its eighth rank, getting a promotion, the piece chosen is written after the move, for example e1Q or e1=Q. Castling is written by the special notations 0–0 for kingside castling and 0–0–0 for queenside. A move which places the opponent's king in check normally has the notation ""+"" added. Checkmate can be written as # or ++. At the end of the game, 1–0 means ""White won"", 0–1 means ""Black won"" and ½-½ is a draw."
"Chess moves can also be shown with punctuation marks and other annotation symbols. For example: ! means a good move, !! means a very good move, ? means a bad move, ?? a very bad move (sometimes called a ""blunder""), !? a creative move that may be good, and ?! a doubtful move. For example, one kind of a simple ""trap"" known as the Scholar's mate, as in the diagram to the right, may be recorded in full notation:"

Violence against women
"Violence against women (VAW in short), also called gender-based violence, is violent acts mostly against women and girls. It is sometimes considered a hate crime. The reason for that is such acts of violence are done against women and girls mainly because they're female."
"The United Nations' Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women says: ""violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power of relations between men and women."""
"Violence against women has several broad categories: rape, sexual harassment, domestic violence, sexual violence, forced marriage and female genital mutilation are among those categories."
"On 11 May 2011, Council of Europe has adopted Istanbul Convention against domestic violence and violence against women."
Vacation
"A vacation (American English) or holiday (British English) is a time for people to relax and take a break from whatever they usually do. People spend their vacation time in different ways. For many, it's a time for tourism. They might go backpacking to a holiday camp, or stay in a trailer, hostel, or hotel. Families often take a vacation together. Because the cost of many things is becoming higher, some people are giving up going on vacation to other countries, and are staying in their home country and finding interesting places to go there. This type of trip is known colloquially as a ""staycation""."
"Vacations are usually taken when somebody has time off of work or school. This means that many people go on vacation during religious or national holidays. Many jobs allow for workers to have several days off during which they will still be paid. This practice, known as annual leave, is another common time for people to go on vacation."
Indigenous marriage in South Africa
"Indigenous marriage in South Africa is a social and legal bond between two clans. This bond is built around a man and a woman in a ukulobola covenant. The delivery of ikhazi things like cattle or other valuables from the man’s family to the woman’s. This bond connects the two clans in a permanent relationship. Children the man and woman have make the bond stronger. When the man and woman are married, the woman will leave her clan and join the man's clan."
Buzzards Bay
Buzzards Bay is a bay next to the southeastern part of the U.S. State of Massachusetts. It is around 28 miles long and eight miles wide.
Distribution.
"The Carolina Coralbead has been reported in the following states of Alabama, Arkansas, Kansas, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas. Locations of the plant range from opening of forests, to the beginning of streams."
Cultivation.
"The flowers are small and plentiful. At a young age, Carolina Coralbead appear greenish. Bloom time for the plant is in late spring and mature by late summer. They grow in tight abundant amounts of bright red berries. By using its scarlet fruits for aesthetic effects, landscapers allow it to be grown on trellises, fences or let naturally flourish through other weeds and shrubs. The berries should not be eaten by people but are eaten by a large number of birds. Each fruit has a single seed that resembles a small snail shell which is protected by the hard endocarp, also known as the inner section of the ovary wall."
Solar time
Solar time relates to the amount of time which has passed according to orbit of the sun. A solar day is the amount of time it takes an object to go around the sun.
Mark St. John
"Mark Leslie Norton (February 7, 1956 – April 5, 2007), better known as Mark St. John, was a guitarist known for his brief work with the rock band Kiss. He was only with Kiss a short time, but he was featured on the album ""Animalize"", the second album of the ""unmasked"" period. St. John's only video appearance with Kiss is in the video for the hit single ""Heaven's on Fire"". After leaving Kiss, he formed a band called White Tiger. Mark St. John died on the morning of April 5, 2007, of a cerebral hemorrhage."

Ragdoll
"The ragdoll is a cat breed that is large, with blue eyes, and a semi-longhair soft and silky coat of fur. It is usually mostly white, with light to dark marks."
"The ragdoll was first bred by an American breeder named Ann Baker from a Persian-like cat (without a pedigree) and a Birman cat with the Siamese colorpoint gene. It is similar in appearance to the Himalayan, which was bred directly from the Persian and Siamese."
"The Ragdoll is gentle, easy going, and affectionate. The breed was named ""Ragdoll"" because they often go limp and relax like a rag or cloth doll when it is picked up. The original mother cat that the breed was created from was involved in a car accident, but contrary to popular belief, this is not why the breed goes limp when picked up (injuries from an accident are not passed on to offspring genetically)."
"Ragdoll is a breed that enjoys being around humans and it may follow its owner around the house. Due to its soft nature, it is strictly recommended to be an indoor only cat."
"In addition to the colorpoint pattern, Ragdolls may also have mittens (white paws)."
Srinivasa Ramanujan
"Srinivasa Ramanujan Aiyangar (December 22, 1887 – April 26, 1920) was an Indian mathematician. His father's name was K. Srinivasa Iyengar and his mother's name was Komalatammal. On 1st October 1892 Ramanujan was enrolled at local school. He had no formal training in mathematics. However, he has made a large contribution to number theory, infinite series and continued fractions."
"He was mentored by G. H. Hardy in the early 1910s. After getting his degree at Cambridge, Ramanujan did his own work. He compiled over 3500 identities and equations in his life. Some of the identities were found in his “lost notebook”. When the notebook was discovered, mathematicians proved almost all of Ramanujan's work. His discoveries have led to many advancements in mathematics. His formulae are now being used in crystallography and string theory."
"In 2011, Ramanujan's birthday was made “National Mathematics Day” by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh."
North South MRT line
"The North South MRT line is the first Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) line in Singapore to be built. It is 45 km long with 26 stations, and it is being operated by SMRT Trains. It would usually take one hour to travel from one end of the MRT line to the other. This line is coloured red on the MRT Rail map."
"This line joins the Central area of Singapore to the Northern and Southern areas of Singapore. To transfer to the East West MRT line, a commuter can transfer at Jurong East, Raffles Place or City Hall. Transferring to the North East MRT Line is done at Dhoby Ghaut with a linkway. Bishan MRT Station, Dhoby Ghaut MRT Station and Marina Bay MRT Station can transfer a commuter to the Circle MRT Line. Transfer to the Downtown line is provided at Newton MRT Station."
History.
Main route.
"The first section of the north south line opened on 7 November 1987 between Toa Payoh and Yio Chu Kang. Afterwards, the section to Outram Park (now on the East West MRT line) opened. Following that, the rest of the line opened stage by stage."
"A globe that represents the Earth is usually mounted at a 23.5° angle on bearings. This mounting represents the axial tilt of the spinning planet, in relation to the Sun. This makes it easy to visualize how days and seasons change."
Noah
"Noah (meaning rest or comfort) is a man in the Abrahamic religions. He was the son of Lamech, and the father of sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Noah and his ark are in the Book of Genesis, which also describes Noah as the 'first man to plant a vineyard' (chapter 9). Several other parts of the Bible mention him, as does the Quran."
The Ark.
"As described in the Book of Genesis, Noah and his family kept believing in God in a time when most people were not, like his son Canaan and his wife Naamah. Knowing this was true, God told Noah he was going to flood the world, so he could drown out evil. He told Noah to build a boat called an ""ark"". Noah was to put himself, his family (except his son and his wife because they refused to come aboard the ark), and two (a male and a female) of every kind of animal on it. People laughed at Noah, but they were killed by the flood with his son and his wife. Noah and family stayed on the ark until they reached land. To find land Noah sent out a dove, which returned with an olive branch. After the flood, God made a rainbow as a promise to say that he would never destroy the Earth by flood again. When they were able to walk on dry land, the animals were released and they were able to repopulate the earth."

July 4
Andrew Jackson
"Andrew Jackson originally known as Andrew Jackson, Jr. (March 15, 1767 – June 8, 1845) was an American politician. He was a General in the War of 1812. He later became the seventh president of the United States of America. He was the first Democrat and is on the twenty dollar bill. His nickname was ""Old Hickory"". He forced many Native Americans to leave their homeland so white people could live there, and many died. This was called the Trail of Tears."
Early life.
As a boy Andrew Jackson was a messenger for the Continental Army. The British caught him and mistreated him.
He was the first U.S. president who was not born into a rich family. He was not a rich man and did not have a college education. He moved to Tennessee and became a politician.
Military.
"During the War of 1812, he became a general and won the Battle of New Orleans which made him very famous. He joined the war because of childhood trauma that he had endured during the Revolutionary War; both his mother and his brother died during the war, and Jackson blamed the British and wanted to avenge his late loved ones."
Marriage.
"In 1791, he fell in love with Rachel Donelson Robards. They went through a marriage ceremony. However, the marriage was not legal because she had not been granted a divorce from her first husband. Therefore, they married legally three years later. They had no children, but they adopted several. He became rich and owned a large plantation."
Politics.
"In the 1790s Jackson was a member of the United States House of Representatives, the United States Senate, and the Supreme Court of Tennessee. In 1823 he returned to the Senate."
Andrew Jackson reorganized the Democratic Party and was its leader.
"In 1828, he defeated John Quincy Adams in the Presidential Election of 1828, he became president on March 4, 1829, and four years later he was re-elected to a second term as president. In the Nullification Crisis of 1832-1833, South Carolina declared secession from the United States. Jackson threatened war, and then compromised."
"In January 1835, Jackson was almost assassinated when an unemployed painter wanted to shoot him but both his guns jammed. He is the first president to have had an attempted assassination."
"During his presidency, he signed the Indian Removal Act which allowed the U.S. government to violently force the Native Americans to move from their land and go west. Many Native Americans were killed and the path they walked to get to the west was called the Trail of Tears."
Andrew Jackson was against the national bank of the United States because he felt that banks and their banknotes were for rich and powerful people and did not serve the interests of the common man. The national bank expired during Jackson's presidency. Jackson chose not to continue the bank.
"On March 4, 1837, Andrew Jackson finished his second term. After that, vice-president Martin Van Buren was elected president and continued many of the things Jackson did. Jackson was a big influence on other Democrats during the 1800s."
Legacy.
"Jackson's legacy among historians is mixed, going downhill, and heavily debated. Some have liked him because he was against aristocrats, bankers, businessmen, the British Empire, cities, and paper money, and in favor of ordinary country people. Some have disliked him for the same reasons and because he was in favor of war and against Indians."
Pillow
A pillow is a soft cushion that a person puts under their head when they are sleeping in a bed.
"A pillow is made from two pieces of cloth that are sewn together and stuffed with a soft material, such as feathers, duck down, or synthetic batting (man made soft stuffing). Pillows are usually rectangular. Pillows are covered with a fabric sheet called a pillowcase. The pillowcase protects the pillow from getting dirty."
"The word ""pillow"" comes from Middle English ""pilwe"", from Old English ""pyle"" (akin to Old High German ""pfuliwi"") and from Latin ""pulvinus"". The word ""pillow"" was first known to be used before the 12th century."
History.
"There is no clear inventor of the pillow. Millions of years ago, animals learned to use pillows. An early example is monkeys resting their heads on their arm. Many animals, including birds, use wood and stone nests as pillows. Many domesticated animals have also learned to make use of human-made pillows and cushions. They also rest on members of their own and other species for the same reason."
Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt.
"In ancient Mesopotamia, people slept on stone pillows. Pillows were a status symbol. Early pillows were rectangular and had grooves shaped for the head. Pillows showed the wealth of a person — the more a person owned the wealthier they were."
"Anicent Egyptians used pillows as a solution to back, neck and shoulder pain. They also prevented insects from crawling in their hair, mouth or nose at night. Anicent Egyptian pillows were made out of wood and stone and looked like stands. These pillows were mostly used for the deceased."
Whaler
"A whaler is a person who hunts whales, or the boat they use."
The recency effect is normally said to be caused by short-term memory. (STM) The STM of a person can store a small amount of information for a short time. The amount of information is normally two to four items. The last few items of a list being normally still in the STM of a person when the items are being recalled. This theory explains why the recency effect is generally larger than the primacy effect. It takes more effort to get the first items from long-term memory (LTM) than to get the items from STM. This is affected by the STM of the person being affected by a distraction.
"Newer research has shown that the recency effect can exist without STM. For instance, Bjork and Whitten showed that even when STM was distracted there can be a long-term recency effect. During their study, they had the people do something to affect their STM during the entire test. These test showed that there was still some recency effect . Some psychologists think that the recency effect is based on a theory of temporal context. Temporal context means ""the context of time"". Theories in this field are vague and still developing. The general idea is that context is connected to each item on the list. During recall, This contect will help the person remember the item. The later the item in the list, the more similar the context of the item is to context of the test."
Link to models of memory.
Earlier research showed that the serial position effect was connected to single way that memory is stored such as LTM (primacy) and STM (recency). Research on people with brain damage that affected their LTM has showed a recency effect but not a primacy effect. This gives good evidence for this.
"On the other hand, the serial position effect is also supported by dual-store or multi-store models of memory. For instance, research on the serial position effect supports the multi-store model of memory by Atkinson and Shieffrin. Research about the long-term recency effect may show evidence for theories of the working memory model."

Boycott
"A boycott is a protest where the protesters do not buy a product or give money to a company. Instead of buying a certain product, they might also buy another, very similar product from a different company."
"The word was made during the ""Irish Land War""'. It comes from the name of Captain Charles Boycott. Boycott was in charge of looking after the land of a landlord in County Mayo, Ireland. In 1880, the tenants (those who rented) wanted their rent lowered. Boycott refused, and threw them out of the land they had rented. The Irish Land League then proposed that instead of becoming violent, everyone in the community should stop doing business with Captain Boycott. The captain was soon isolated. No one helped him with the harvest, no one worked in his stables or his house. Local businessmen no longer traded with him, the postman no longer delivered his post."
"To get his harvest done, he had to hire 50 people from other counties, the counties Cavan and Monaghan. They were escorted to and from their work by 1000 policemen. Of course, this cost far more than what the harvest was worth."
Artificial
"When something is artificial, or man-made, it has been made by humans, not nature. For example, an artificial satellite is one made by humans, while a natural satellite is a satellite that was not made by humans. Many artificial things imitate or copy things found in nature. The imitation may use the same basic materials as those in the natural object; or it may use quite different materials, as in Artificial leather. These are concepts in defining reality. There are different ideas about what can be considered artificial and what is natural."
"The word ""artificial"" comes from the Latin words ""art"" (meaning ""skill"") and ""fex"" (""to make"")."
"Artificial does not necessarily mean ""synthetic"" (that is, created by synthesis). An artificial sweetener imitates sweetness using a chemical formula that is not found in nature; it is therefore both artificial and synthetic."
King Arthur
"King Arthur was a mythical king in the mythology of Great Britain. He lived in the medieval times, in his famous castle, Camelot. He possessed a sword known as Excalibur, given to him by the Lady of the Lake."
"King Arthur is a fabled ruler of Sub-Roman Britain who defended his kingdom from the Anglo-Saxons. He is a popular fictional character in modern literature. He won several battles, and had many homes. However, his favorite home was in Camelot. In one of the most famous tales of King Arthur, he pulls a sword out of a stone, making him King of the Britons."
"The first narrative account of Arthur's life is found in Geoffrey of Monmouth's Latin work ""Historia Regum Britanniae"" (""History of the Kings of Britain""), completed ."
Camelot.
"Many castles claim to be Arthur's Camelot, but the most likely one is Tintagel Castle, Cornwall (though there is no evidence for this). In Camelot sat the famous Round Table, where Arthur, his queen Guinevere, Merlin, Morgan le Fay, Sir Lancelot, Sir Gawain, Percival and many other valiant knights sat. Arthur and his knights went on many quests including The Quest For The Holy Grail, The Green Knight, The Black Knight and more."
Death.
"After King Arthur's many adventures, his son Mordred seized his kingdom and queen, forcing Arthur to fight for what was truly his. They fought for a long time. Mordred hit King Arthur in many places, but in the end Arthur killed Mordred. After this victory, King Arthur was weak and died from losing blood from battle wounds. As his knights rode back to Camelot, they threw Excalibur into the lake so that it could return to where it came from. One legend says Arthur never died, and will return when the British need him."
"Books, poems and movies."
"Many books have been written about King Arthur. Most of them involve Merlin, the Knights of the Round Table, and Morgan le Fay."
"Geoffrey of Monmouth wrote the first book about Arthur in the 12th century. In the 15th century, Sir Thomas Malory wrote one of the best-known books about Arthur, called ""Le Morte d’Arthur"" (""The Death of Arthur""). Later, in the 19th century, Alfred, Lord Tennyson visited Tintagel, the mythical Camelot, twice. He wrote a series of poems about Arthur."
"Some stories about Arthur say he tried to find the Holy Grail, the cup that Jesus drank from at the Last Supper."
"There are also many movies about Arthur. These include Disney's ""The Sword in the Stone; Monty Python and the Holy Grail; King Arthur (2004); King Arthur, The Kid Who Would Be King (2019); the Legend of the Sword (2017)""; and the musical ""Camelot""."
Johnny Appleseed
Kleophrades Painter
"The Kleophrades Painter was a red-figure Athenian vase painter. His real name is unknown. His name is taken from a potter's signature on a vase. He was active from about 510470 BC. His work is considered some of the finest of the red figure style. He was probably the pupil of Euthymides, one of the red-figure Pioneers. His work is identified by its stylistic traits. He was very productive. More than 100 vases of his work have survived. He worked in both black- and red- figure styles and techniques. He was conservative, often using old-fashioned techniques. His subjects were traditional but with a emphasis on the Trojan War. He preferred painting large vessels such as amphores."
Clyde Holding
"Allan Clyde Holding (27 April 1931 – 31 July 2011) was an Australian politician. He was Leader of the Opposition in Victoria for ten years, and was later a federal minister. He was a member of the Australian Labor Party."
"Holding was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly for the seat of Richmond in 1962. He was a strong supporter of indigenous Australian rights (including land rights) and national aid for schools. In 1977, he was elected to the House of Representatives as member for Melbourne Ports. When Bob Hawke became Prime Minister in 1983, he put Holding in charge of Aboriginal Affairs. During his term, Holding tried to make federal laws for Aboriginal land rights. But Brian Burke, the Labor Premier of Western Australia, did not want this, because it would have upset the mining and agricultural industries, which were very important to his state. Holding was forced by Hawke to drop the proposal. In 1987, he was moved to the Ministry of Employment Services and Youth Affairs. The next year, he was made Minister for Transport, and then later Minister for Immigration."
Kottabos
"Kottabos () was a party game played at symposia in Ancient Greece. It was popular in the 5th and 4th centuries BC. It was also popular with the Etruscans. The game is played by flinging a bit of wine from one's cup at targets. The player would utter the name of his lover. The game was probably of Sicilian origin but spread throughout the Greek world. Many Greek poets mention the game in their works. By the time of the Roman Empire and the Age of Alexander the Great, the game had died out. It is not mentioned in Latin literature."
Charlie McMahon
"Charlie McMahon (born in the Blue Mountains, New South Wales in 1951) is an Australian didgeridoo player. He was one of the first non-Aboriginal musicians to become a famous player of the instrument. He is probably one of the most famous players of the instrument around the world."
"The band in which he became famous was called Gondwanaland. He has toured across Australia, often visiting remote communities in the outback, and also in Europe and the United States. He often played gigs with Midnight Oil. McMahon's style became an influence for many well-known didgeridoo players. He is also the inventor of the ""didjeribone"", a sliding didgeridoo made of plastic, played in a similar way to the trombone."
Symposium
"A symposium (plural: symposia) was a drinking party in Ancient Greece. Guests were males. Well bred women did not attend. Boys or slave girls served the food and drink, danced, juggled, played music, or otherwise entertained the assembly. These servers were usually nude. The symposium was an aristocratic institution often held to celebrate a young man's entry into adult society, an athletic victory, or a poetic achievement. It was an occasion for male conversation and debate. Party-goers reclined on couches and pillows. Guests played a game called kottabos, wrestled, and held song contests. A symposium is described in Plato's ""The Symposium"". The party is attended by Socrates and the young, drunken, and nearly nude Alcibiades."
Foster Brooks
"Foster Brooks (May 11, 1912 – December 20, 2001) was an American movie, television, radio, stage actor, singer, entertainer, television personality and comedian. He was known for playing a lovable drunken man in nightclubs and television shows. Brooks is also known for appearing in The Dean Martin celebrity roasts."
"Brooks was born in Louisville, Kentucky. Brooks was married twice. First to Loretta Brooks from 1933 until they divorced in 1950. And to Teri Brooks from 1950 until his death in 2001. Brooks died on December 20, 2001 from heart failure in his Encino, Los Angeles, California home, aged 89."
Bob Knight
"Robert Montgomery ""Bob"" Knight (born October 25 1940) is a retired American basketball sports coach. He won over 900 NCAA Division I men's college basketball games. Knight is well known as the head coach of the Indiana Hoosiers from 1971–2000. He also coached for the Texas Tech from 2001–2008."
"Knight was born in Massillon, Ohio. He studied at Ohio State University."
"He has been praised for having a clean program. None of his teams was ever sanctioned by the NCAA for any recruitment violations. He has, however, attracted some controversy for throwing a chair across the courts during a game. He was once arrested for assault. He was fired from Indiana in mid September 2000."
"In April 2015, it was announced that ESPN would not sign Knight's contract for another season."
James Michael Tyler
"James Michael Tyler (May 28, 1962 – October 24, 2021) was an American actor. He was best known for playing Gunther in the sitcom series ""Friends"". Tyler was born in Greenwood, Mississippi and was raised in Winona, Mississippi."
Personal life.
"In June 2021, Tyler said he was diagnosed with stage-4 prostate cancer back in 2018. He died from the disease at his Los Angeles, California home on October 24, 2021 at the age of 59."
Culture.
"The way boys are brought up will be vary a lot between different cultures. Boys are supposed to be tougher than girls. It is their job to do work which is physically hard, including fighting in the army when they are grown up. However, people’s attitudes are changing and nowadays many girls like to do the same things as boys. In Western cultures boys traditionally wear trousers (pants) while girls wear dresses or skirts. However, many girls also wear trousers these days, like boys, especially when dressed informally. Boys often have shorter hair than girls, although this can vary a lot according to quickly changing fashions."
"Traditionally boys like rough games (such as soccer or rugby) and enjoy playing with mechanical things such as toy cars and trains. People today have long discussions about whether this is because they are born like that, or because that is the way society expects them to behave."
"The traditional colour for a boy is blue. For girls it is pink. When a baby is born in a hospital it usually gets a blue or pink tag on its wrist or ankle, according to whether it is a boy or a girl."
Names.
"Some names are boys’ names, others are girls’ names. There are some names which can be for boys and girls (although they may be spelt differently, e.g. “Lesley” for a boy and “Leslie” for a girl)."
"In some countries such as Britain an “old boy” means a grown up who used to be a pupil at a particular school (e.g. “He is an old boy of Cransbury High School”). The expression can also be used in a very informal, friendly way, e.g. “Nice to see you, old boy!”."
Company clerk
"Responsible for performing clerical and administrative duties in an office setting. Assists executive assistants and secretaries by sorting mail, filing, answering phones, greeting clients, scheduling meetings, and restocking supplies."
Paul McCartney
"Sir James Paul McCartney (born 18 June 1942) is an English singer, songwriter and composer. He is internationally known as a singer and bassist of the Beatles. With singer and guitarist John Lennon, he contributed music and lyrics to a lot of the band's songs."
Early Life.
"Paul was born at Walton Centre for Neurology and Neurosurgery (Past is Walton Hospital) in Walton, Liverpool, England, He was son of Jim and Mary McCartney, He had one brother is Michael McCartney and stepsister is called Ruth."
The Beatles (1962–1970).
"McCartney began writing songs before he was sixteen, and has written well over two hundred. His most famous song is ""Yesterday"", recorded by the Beatles in 1965. Since then around 2000 artists have recorded the song. Other songs written by McCartney for The Beatles include ""Can't Buy Me Love"", ""Hey Jude"", ""Penny Lane"", ""Eleanor Rigby"" and ""Let It Be""."
"Often, Beatles songs would have ""Lennon/McCartney"" written on the record, and it would look like that they had written it together. In fact, most Lennon/McCartney songs were written by only one of them, or with one adding only small parts to the other's work. Each counted on the other to help make their songs better, so they agreed to share the credit equally."
Solo music.
"Since the Beatles had stopped working together in 1971, McCartney started a new band called Wings with his wife Linda. Wings also had many hit records, including ""Band On The Run"" and ""Mull Of Kintyre"". McCartney wrote ""Live and Let Die"", which became the theme song to a James Bond film with the same title. Wings disbanded in 1981."
"Later McCartney recorded a single called ""Ebony and Ivory"" with Stevie Wonder, then ""The Girl is Mine"" and ""Say, Say, Say"" with Michael Jackson. A song with Jackson called ""The Man"" was released on McCartney's fifth solo album ""Pipes of Peace"". He and Jackson became friends, but this ended after Jackson outbid McCartney for ownership of the publishing company which owned most of the Beatles's music."
"McCartney had other hit songs, and also wrote and starred in the movie, ""Give My Regards to Broad Street"", with Linda. The theme song from the movie, ""No More Lonely Nights"", was also a hit, but the movie did poorly, and McCartney's popularity suffered. He had to work hard to prove his talent was still strong. He co-wrote new songs with Elvis Costello, and began touring more often than he had in years."
"Along with popular music, McCartney also began composing classical music, including an oratorio about Liverpool. McCartney was knighted for his contributions to music and to British culture, and for his charity work. He bought John Lennon's former school, Quarry Bank, which he then turned into a performing arts school."
"In 1990, the minor planet 4148 was named ""McCartney"" in his honour. In 2010, he was honoured by President Barack Obama with the Gershwin Prize for his contributions to popular music. He returned to the White House later that year as a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors. In 2012, he became the last Beatle to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame."
Personal life.
"McCartney married Linda Eastman, a photographer, in 1969. She had a daughter, Heather, whom he adopted. McCartney and Linda had three more children together, named Mary, Stella and James. Stella became a popular fashion designer after she grew up."
"Linda died in 1998 of breast cancer (McCartney's mother also died from the same disease in 1956). He married model Heather Mills in 2002; the couple's child Beatrice was born in 2003. McCartney and Mills separated in 2006, and, after a long battle over a settlement, McCartney and Mills divorced in March 2008."
"McCartney married New Yorker Nancy Shevell, 51, in a civil ceremony at Old Marylebone Town Hall, London, on 9 October 2011. The couple had been dating since November 2007."
Paul is dead.
There was an urban legend that said that McCartney died in a car crash in 1966 and was replaced by a look-alike.
Discography.
Solo
Wheezing is caused by the airways being too narrow. This can happen because of diseases like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD).
"If the airways are too narrow, the oxygen the body needs cannot get through. This can become a medical emergency."
There are a few different treatments that can be used for wheezing:
Stridor.
"Stridor is a high-pitched sound that usually happens when a person breathes in. It may sound a lot like wheezing. Medical professionals can tell the difference by listening to the throat with a stethoscope. If the sound they hear is louder in the throat, it is stridor, not wheezing."
Stridor is usually caused by something blocking the larynx (voice box). This can happen because:
"Like wheezing, stridor can signal a medical emergency if not enough oxygen is able to get through the airways."
Treatment for stridor depends on the cause:
Children are more likely to have stridor because of choking. They are more likely to choke because their airways are smaller. They are also more likely to get childhood infections like croup or epiglottitis that can cause stridor.
Rales (fine crackles).
"Rales are also called fine crackles, because they often sound like a fine crackling noise. They are heard when a person breathes in, on both sides (in both lungs). Rales may also sound like bubbling, rattling, or small clicking sounds."
"Rales are heard when a person has fluid in their lungs. This is called pulmonary edema. Pulmonary edema may happen for many reasons, like:"
"Rales signals pulmonary edema, no matter what is causing that pulmonary edema. When a medical professional listens to the lungs, rales usually start at the bottom of the lungs. As the pulmonary edema gets worse and fluid fills the lungs more, rales can be heard closer and closer to the top of the lungs."
Rhonchi (coarse crackles).
"Rhonchi are also called coarse crackles, because they sound like coarse, rattling, crackling sounds. Rhonchi and rales can sound a lot alike. The main differences are:"
"Rhonchi are usually caused by mucus in the bronchi, the tubes that lead to the lungs. For example, if a person has pneumonia, mucus can build up in their bronchi and the bronchi's airways, and cause rhonchi."
Unequal breath sounds.
"In a healthy person, breath sounds should always sound the same on both sides. This signals that both lungs are working well. If breath sounds cannot be heard in one lung, this can signal a serious problem. It means that air is not getting in and out of that lung."
One of the most common causes of unequal breath sounds is a collapsed lung (pneumothorax). A lung can collapse for many different reasons:
A pneumothorax is often a medical emergency and needs to be treated in a hospital.
Conversation Peace
"Conversation Peace is the 22nd album released by American musician Stevie Wonder. It was released on the Motown label in 1995. The album was Wonder's first studio album since 1987's ""Characters"". The album was going to be released in 1993, which was the last year new jack swing was popular, but Wonder continued to work on the album through to 1995 and the album wasn't contemporary enough to get radio airplay. It had three singles, ""For Your Love"", ""Tomorrow Robins Will Sing"" and ""Treat Myself""."
Track listing.
"All songs written and composed by Stevie Wonder, except where noted."
Personnel.
Personnel involved in the album include:
Ridley (Metroid)
"is a fictional character in the ""Metroid"" video game series. Ridley is a draconic extraterrestrial and an archenemy of Samus Aran. Ridley led an attack on Samus's home planet of K-2L which destroyed the world and killed her parents. Ridley appears in his metal form in ""Metroid Prime"" and """"."
Reception.
"Ridley has received a positive critical response from fans and video game publications. Nintendo Power ranked Ridley at #6 on their list of favorite Nintendo villains. Jesse Schedeen of IGN called Ridley the real villain of the ""Metroid"" series, saying that they would have to include him in a ""Metroid"" movie because he would be too important to leave out."
Currency
Currency is the unit of money used by the people of a country or Union for buying and selling goods and services.
"Certain currencies are said to be ""pegged"" or ""fixed"" to something, usually another currency. A fixed or pegged currency is one that has a constant value compared to what it is pegged to. For example, the Cape Verdian escudo is pegged to the Euro. If the value of the Euro goes up 1% compared to another form of currency, the value of the escudo also goes up 1% compared to that same currency."
"Many countries have used systems where their currency was pegged to a commodity rather than to another currency. Most used either gold or silver. When they did this, as the value of gold increased, so did the value of their money. This was called the ""gold standard"" or ""silver standard"". Most countries stopped using silver and gold standards in the 20th century."
Some well-known currencies are:

Radio telescope
"A radio telescope is a type of antenna used for radio astronomy. The majority look like a huge satellite television dish. Stars shine, and the light can be seen with an ordinary telescope, but they also give off radio waves. Scientists with radio telescopes receive these radio waves and use computers to learn about the stars. Other things like black holes also give off radio waves, and radio telescopes are useful for learning about them too."
"The dish is sometimes constructed of a conductive wire mesh whose openings are smaller than a wavelength. The information received by several radio telescopes in different places can be combined. This gives similar results to having a single dish as big as the distance between the telescopes. It can receive very faint signals, and see more details. The biggest telescope is a virtual radio telescope almost as big as the Earth, called the Event Horizon Telescope."
"The radio telescope at the Parkes Observatory, Parkes, New South Wales was used by NASA to receive messages from the Apollo 11 moon landings."
Light year
"A light year (symbol: ly) is the distance that light travels in empty space in one year. Since the speed of light is about 300,000 km per second (about 186,000 miles per second), then a light year is 9.46 trillion kilometers (about 5.87 trillion miles), for AU, one light year is 63,241 AU. A light year is not a length of time."
"The light year is used in astronomy because the universe is huge. Space objects such as stars and galaxies may be hundreds, thousands or millions of light years away."
Example.
"Think of a star at a distance of 100 light years from us on Earth. Light leaves the star and takes 100 years to get to us. When we see the star's light, we are seeing that star as it was 100 years ago."
Korea
"Korea is a peninsula in northeast Asia, the Korean Peninsula. Korea became a country (or state) in 918."
"In 1948, it split into two countries: North Korea and South Korea. North and South Korea and their allies fought against each other in the Korean War."
"People have lived in Korea for about 15,000 years. In the past, some of modern Manchuria and Siberia was governed by Korea. Korea is known for its fine silk. In the 7th century, the people of China sought after gold-workers from Korea. Europeans had little knowledge about Korea until the modern era."
"South Korea has over 50 million people, and North Korea has more than 23 million. South Korea's biggest city is Seoul, the capital of South Korea. The city has more than 10 million people and the region of Seoul has more than 15 million people. North Korea's biggest city is Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. It has fewer than 4 million people."
Korean people speak the Korean language. Many people in South Korea study English and other languages such as Chinese and Japanese at school.
"South Korea is an advanced country with large cities, high-speed rail trains, high-speed internet, and many television and radio networks. Many Korean television dramas are popular around the world. But there are still poor areas, even in South Korea. The Korean farmers are not rich and struggle to compete with cheap food from other countries."
History.
"Gojoseon is the first state in Korean history. It was established in 2333 BCE. Its real name is Joseon, but it is called Gojoseon to make it different from other Joseon in Korean history. Go is a Korean prefix meaning 'old'. The founder of Gojoseon is said to be Dangun. The Korean people believe that Dangun established the country on October 3rd, and still celebrate that day. In Korea, October 3rd is a national holiday, which is named Gaecheonjeol (The day heaven opened). It is said to be the day that Dangun's father whose name is Hwan-ung came from the sky on October 3rd 2457 BCE. Gochosun was destroyed by the Chinese Han Dynasty in 108 BCE."
"After Gojoseon had been destroyed, there were many confederations in the Korean Peninsula and Manchuria: Mahan, Byeonhan, Jinhan, Buyeo, Dongye, Okjeo, Goguryeo, and so on. The ancient confederation countries later merged into three more powerful kingdoms and an advanced confederation country."
Reptiliomorpha
Reptiliomorpha is a clade of the amniotes and those tetrapods that share a more recent common ancestor with amniotes than with living amphibians (lissamphibians).
"Unfortunately, different experts have used the term in several different ways. It has even been used for fossils of early amphibians. It is best used for animals which lay cleidoic eggs, but are not synapsids. Otherwise precursors of reptiles (sauropsids) get lumped together with precursors of mammals (synapsids)."
"Its only justification is that it may not always be possible to decide which group a fossil is from. But gradually, as with ""Seymouria"", it is possible to separate fossils into more specific grouups."
Youth Riding a Hippalektryon (Epiktetos)
"Youth Riding a Hippalektryon is a circular painting (tondo) in the bottom of the bowl of an ancient Greek terracotta drinking cup. It was painted by Epiktetos. It is dated to the Archaic period of Greek art (ca. 530–520 BC). The cup stands about 5 1/8 in. (13 cm) tall. A hippalektryon is a mythical creature, part horse and part rooster. The cup is held in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. The museum writes, ""Late sixth-century vases connected with drinking occasionally have subjects that go beyond the familiar gorgons, griffins, or sphinxes. The hippalektryon belongs to this category. It is interesting to compare this piece to the fine early red-figure plate by Epiktetos showing a youth riding a rooster."""
Spy-fi
"The genre known as Spy-fi is a cross-over between the genres of spy fiction and science fiction. The story usually involves a spy with advanced technological weapons or gadgets, and sometimes the villain is a mad scientist or evil genius with robots or advanced technological weapons and gadgets. The film and novel series ""James Bond"" was a popularizer of the genre, as well as such TV shows as The Man from UNCLE, , and I Spy."
Amanda Marshall
"Amanda Marshall (born August 29, 1972) is a Canadian pop-rock singer. Her self-titled first record was in 1995. It was a major success in Canada. Her most successful single was ""Birmingham"". Marshall has released many singles. She has not had a studio album since around 2001."
Singing Reveler (Epiktetos)
Singing Reveler is the tondo (circular painting) in a terracotta drinking cup said to have been painted by Epiktetos. It is dated about 520510 BC. The cup measures 3 1/16 x 9 15/16 x 7 1/16 to 7 3/16 in. The cup is in the collections of The J. Paul Getty Museum.
"The tondo depicts an older, balding man reclining on a couch and singing. The setting is probably a drinking party (""symposium""). These cups were meant to be used at such parties and were often decorated with party scenes."
"The tondo presented problems to painters. It was difficult to present upright figures in a circle. Epiktetos solved this problem by using the couch as a line. The man's mantle slipping from the couch creates depth and space. The museum writes, ""Epiktetos also used the circular frame of the tondo as part of the composition: it supports the man's pillow, and he props his foot on it."""
Pentathletes (Carpenter Painter)
"Pentathletes is a painting on an ancient Greek terracotta drinking cup from Athens. It is said to be the work of the Carpenter Painter. It is dated about 510500 BC. The cup measures 4 5/16 x 15 x 13 3/16 in. In the circular painting (tondo) at the bottom of the bowl of the cup, a youth pulls an older man to him for a kiss. The outside of the cup depicts bearded men and youths exercising with discus and javelin. A youth in a long robe plays music. The pictures reflect the interests of the aristocrats who would have used such a cup at a drinking party."
Salt pan
"A salt plain (also known as a salt pan or salt flat) is a flat area of ground covered with salt and other minerals. They are usually purely white. They are found in desert areas. In areas where salt plains form, the rate of evaporation (how quickly water dries up) is faster than the rate of precipitation (how often rain falls). A salt plain is formed where a lake or pond would otherwise be found. When the water dries up, the minerals stay left behind on the suface of the ground. Over thousands of years, the minerals (usually salts) build up on the surface."
"Large salt plains are common in the Sahara Desert, the Kalahari Desert, the Rann of Kutch, the western United States and the central deserts of Australia. The Altiplano in Bolivia has the world's largest salt plan, the Salar de Uyuni."
Witchetty grub
"A witchetty grub (also spelled witchety grub or witjuti grub) is the large, white larva of a moth. It is a name used in Australia. Normally, it refers to the larvae of the cossid moth ""Endoxyla leucomochla"", found in central Australia. These moths eat the roots of the witchetty bush (a plant named after the grubs). It is also sometimes used to refer to the larvae of other cossid moths, as well as those of ghost moths (Hepialidae). It is used mainly when the larvae are being thought of as food. Because it contains a lot of protein, the grub is the most important insect food of the desert. It was a staple in the diets of nomadic Aboriginal people living in the outback."
"The name ""witchetty"" (or ""witjuti"") comes from the Adnyamathanha language. The name comes from the words ""wityu"" (meaning ""hooked stick"") and ""vartu"" (meaning ""grub"")."

43 × 0 = 0
0 ÷ 43 = 0
43 ÷ 0 has an undefined answer.
0 ÷ 0 has no answer.
"The following table includes all of the above examples along with other operations in a condensed, generalized form (where ""x"" represents any number)."
History of zero.
"The idea of zero was first thought about in Babylon, India and in Central America at different times. Some places and countries did not know about zero, which may have made it harder for those people to do mathematics. For example, the year after 1 BC is AD 1 (there is no year zero). In India, zero was theorized in the seventh century by the mathematician Brahmagupta."
"Over hundreds of years, the idea of zero was passed from country to country, from India and Babylon to other places, like Greece, Persia and the Arab world. The Europeans learned about zero from the Arabs, and stopped using Roman math. This is why numbers are called ""Arabic numerals""."
The place of zero as a number.
"Zero is almost never used as a place number (ordinal number). This means that it is not used like 1, 2, or 3 to indicate the order, or place, of something, like 1st, 2nd, or 3rd. An exception to this is seen in many programming languages."
Some other things about zero:
"Any number divided by itself equals one, except if that number is zero. In symbols:"
"0 ÷ 0 = ""not a number."""
"In time, zero means ""now"". For example, when a person is counting down the time to the start of something, such as a foot race or when a rocket takes off, the count is: ""three, two, one, zero (or ""go"")"". Zero is the exact time of the start of the race or when the rocket takes off into the sky."
0 as a number.
Definition.
"0 is the integer that precedes the positive 1, and follows −1. In most (if not all) numerical systems, 0 was identified before the idea of 'negative integers' was accepted. It means ""courageous one"" in hieroglyphics."
"Zero is a number which means an amount of null size; that is, if the number of brothers is zero, that means the same thing as having no brothers, and if something has a weight of zero, it has no weight. If the difference between the numbers of pieces in two piles is zero, it means the two piles have an equal number of pieces. Before counting starts, the result can be assumed to be zero; that is the number of items counted before one counts the first item, and counting the first item brings the result to one. And if there are no items to be counted, zero remains the final result."
Debates.

"While mathematicians all accept zero as a number, some non-mathematicians would say that zero is not a number, arguing that one cannot have zero of something. Others say that if one has a bank balance of zero, one has a specific quantity of money in that account, namely none. It is that latter view which is accepted by mathematicians and most others."
Is zero a natural number ?
A debate asking if 0 is or not a natural number has been discussed over time.
Encyclopædia Britannica says 0 is a natural number. Wolfram MathWorld´says it isn't. The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences says it isn't. The Princeton Companion to Mathematics says 0 is a natural number.
"Although the International Baccalaureate thinks 0 to be a natural number. Oxford Dictionary says ""a positive whole number such as 1, 2, or 3, and sometimes also zero""."
As year.
"There was no year zero between 1 BC and 1 AD. More specifically, almost all historians leave out the year zero from the proleptic Gregorian and Julian calendars (that is, from the normal calendar used in English-speaking countries), but astronomers include it in these same calendars. However, the phrase Year Zero may be used to describe any event considered so important, that someone might want to start counting years all over again from zero."
0 as a numeral.
"The modern numeral 0 is normally written as a circle or (rounded) rectangle. In old-style fonts with text figures, 0 is usually the same height as a lowercase x."
"On the seven-segment displays of calculators, watches, etc., 0 is usually written with six line segments, though on some historical calculator models, it was written with four line segments. The four-segment 0 is not common."
"The ""number"" zero (as in the ""zero brothers"" example above) is not the same as the ""numeral"" or ""digit"" zero, used in numeral systems using positional notation. Successive positions of digits have higher values, so the digit zero is used to skip a position and give appropriate value to the preceding and following digits. A zero digit is not always necessary in a different positional number system. Something called bijective numeration is a possible example of a system without zeroes."
The numerical digit zero.
"The season lasts 18 weeks. Each team plays 17 games and has one week off. This week of rest is called a ""bye week""."
NFL playoffs.
"At the end of the regular season, the winners of each division and the next three best teams in each conference play in a tournament. The NFC's champion and The AFC's champion play the NFL's final game, the Super Bowl. The event is often treated as a National holiday as many stores close for the event. The day of the event is commonly known nationwide as Super Bowl Sunday."

Notes
The Ugly Duckling
"""The Ugly Duckling"" () is a literary fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen. Andersen lavished great care on this story, spending a year perfecting it. It was first published in 1844 with ""The Angel"", ""The Sweethearts"", and ""The Nightingale"" in ""New Fairy Tales"". The critics liked these stories. Andersen considered the story ""a reflection of my own life."" The moral of the tale: ""it does not matter if you were born in a duck yard if you have lain in a swan's egg."" The tale has been adapted to various media such as animated movies."
Story.
"A mother duck hatches six pretty little ducklings. A seventh bird is hatched. He is homely. The other ducks abuse him. He runs away. He is given a home by an old woman. Her cat and hen do not like him. He runs away again. Winter comes and a kind farmer gives him a home. The little bird almost dies. Spring comes. The ""ugly duckling"" has grown into a beautiful swan. The other swans welcome him as their own. They bow to him. He is happy for the first time in his life."
General relativity
"General relativity is a theory of space and time. The theory was published by Albert Einstein in 1915. The central idea of general relativity is that space and time are two aspects of spacetime. Spacetime is curved when there is matter, energy, and momentum resulting in what we perceive as gravity. The links between these forces are shown in the Einstein field equations. In general relativity, gravity has no force as Newton put forward. According to Einstein it is a curvature that warps not only space, but also time. (Time dilation)"
Idea.
"A central idea in general relativity is the ""principle of equivalence."" An example is that two people, one in an elevator sitting on the surface of the earth, and the other in an elevator in outer space but accelerating upwards at the speed of 9.8 m/s2 (every second the object picks up speed of 9.8 m/s), will each observe the same behavior of an object they drop from their hands. The object will accelerate to the floor at 9.8 m/s2 in either case, making it impossible for either to distinguish whether or not they are at rest in a gravitational field or accelerating upward creating the same effect as gravity would on Earth. Other versions of this type of ""thought experiment"" were used to show that light would curve in an accelerating frame of reference (perspective). There are several forms of the equivalence principle. These include: Newton's equivalence principle, the weak equivalence principle, the gravitational weak equivalence principle, Einstein's equivalence principle and the strong equivalence principle."
"The Sun can be seen as this kind of valley in spacetime, and one of the other objects in the valley (i.e, spacetime) is the Earth. The Earth does not roll directly towards the Sun (or ball) because it is moving too fast. The force pulling the Earth towards the sun is about the same as a second force. This second force is called the centrifugal force. The centrifugal force exists because the Earth moves sideways. This sideways motion makes the distance between the Earth and Sun increase. Since the Earth is being pulled towards the sun and moving away at the same time, it stays at about the same distance. This is also how the Moon orbits the earth. In this second case, Earth is the ball and the Moon is the object. However, this valley example to demonstrate Gravity is insufficient because spacetime fabric is actually Four Dimensional, whereas valley's example implies two dimensional spacetime. Sun and other objects with mass curves four dimensional spacetime fabric. Valley example is just analogy and not 100% reality."
Predictions.
General relativity has predicted many things which were later seen. These include:
Rutland
"Rutland is the smallest county of England. It is surrounded by the counties of Leicestershire, Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire."
The main towns of Rutland are Oakham and Uppingham.
"In the mid-1970s, it was the inspiration for Eric Idle's TV show, Rutland Weekend Television."
Adlai Stevenson I
"Adlai Ewing Stevenson (October 23, 1835 – June 14, 1914) was an American politician. He was vice president of the United States under Grover Cleveland, and ran for President and several other political offices, but lost. He was also first assistant Postmaster General and a member of the United States House of Representatives from Illinois, as well. His grandson of the same name also was a notable politician and writer. Another grandson, McLean Stevenson was an actor. His other grandson was Illinois Senator Adlai Stevenson III."
"Toledo, Ohio"
"Toledo is a city in Ohio, USA. It was named after Toledo, Spain. It is a large industrial city, and has many factories that make things like car parts and glass. In 1835 and 1836, Ohio and Michigan both claimed to own the city and surrounding territory. Michigan gave up its claim and got the Upper Peninsula in exchange. Toledo is about an hour from Detroit, Michigan. The main highways in and out of Toledo are Interstate 75, Interstate 90, and U.S. 24 (Detroit Boulevard, Telegraph Road). It is the 59th largest city in the United States."
Toledo's manufacturing industry concentrates on automobiles and glass.
"Toledo has a humid continental climate (""Dfa"" in the Köppen climate classification)."
"Lao has mainly native Lao words. Because of Buddhism, however, it has been influenced by other languages that contributed mostly religious terms. Lao has influenced Khmer and Thai and . The writing has many foreign loanwords, very similar to how Latin and Greek have influenced other European languages."
"For politeness, pronouns (and more formal pronouns) are used, as well as ending statements with ແດ່ (dè ) or ເດີ້ (deu ). Negative statements are made more polite by ending with ດອກ (dok ). The following are formal register examples."
Sukiyaki
"Sukiyaki is a very popular one-pot meal in Japan. The main ingredient (or stuff) is thin sliced beef, and it is simmered in a skillet or pan in the sukiyaki sauce with many vegetables and other ingredients. The word ""yaki"" means ""sautee"" or ""grill"" in Japanese. The word is used because the beef in sukiyaki is sauteed in the hot skillet."
History.
"In Japan, because of religious beliefs people were forbidden to eat beef, venison, horse, mutton and other meat from Asuka era to Meizi era. issue of religion. Cattle and horse were also work animals, therefore if people eat cattle and horse meat, people were punished. This custom was publicly decided by the then emperor on April 1, 675. But it is said that the real intention of this custom was to raise cultivation of rice product. This is a commandment (or rule) of Buddhism. But difficulty in making a living meant that people secretly ate boar and venison meat. Over time people ate beef secretly."
"The first sukiyaki store opened in Kyoto at the last days of the Tokugawa Shogunate. The Meiji emperor ate beef. He liked taste of sukiyaki. After that, the emperor lifted the ban on eating beef. People were allowed to eat beef publicly. In the west it is called “Sukiyaki”, in the east it is called “Gyunabe”. It is popular all over Japan. Sukiyaki’s contents do not change now. It is thinly sliced beef cooked in an iron pot, with bean curd, sliced onion, mushroom and other kinds of seasoning. Then the beef and vegetables are picked directly from the pan by chopstick and eaten by dipping them into a small bowl containing raw egg. Sukiyaki became symbol of cultural enlightenment."
Preparation.
"Each Japanese region has a preferred way of cooking sukiyaki. Japan can be divided into two regions. The big variation is between ""Kansai"" (western Japan) and ""Kanto"" (eastern Japan). In the Kanto (Tokyo) region, sukiyaki is based on ""Gyunabe"" that was in fashion in ""Meiji"" period. Before cooking sukiyaki, people prepare the soup stock mixing a seasonings (soy sauce, sugar, ""sake"" and ""mirin"") together. They then stew beef in it."
"In the ""Kansai"" region, people grill meat in the pan greased with lard. After that, they put the other ingredients over these, and the liquid is poured into the pan. They do not grill meat and the ingredients that make the meat tough, and they do not grill the meat and watery vegetables at a same time. This is the"" Kansai"" style of cooking sukiyaki."
"The border between the styles of cooking sukiyaki is becoming unclear. Some people say that the border between eastern and western is in Aichi. But recently, ready-made stock, pre-mixed with seasoning used to flavor sukiyaki is sold all over Japan, so the border is no longer clear."
Poplar DLR station
"Poplar DLR station serves Poplar, London. It is a station on the Docklands Light Railway in Travelcard Zone 2. It is a served by four of the five routes of the DLR. Thus it is the busiest station on the network in terms of services."
Shawm
"The shawm was a musical instrument of the woodwind family that was played in Europe during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. The modern oboe was developed from the shawm. Like the modern oboe, the shawm was played by blowing into a double reed. It was usually made from one piece of wood, with a flare at the end (like a trumpet). It sounded very loud, and was mostly used outdoors."
"In German the shawm is called ""Schalmei"" or ""Pommer"". The first word may have come from the Latin word ""calamus"" meaning ""reed or stalk"". There were many kinds of shawm over the centuries in Europe and they had a variety of names. There were also several different sizes."
Westferry DLR station
"Westferry DLR station is a station on the Docklands Light Railway (DLR), in the Limehouse district of east London. The station is in Travelcard Zone 2. To the west is Limehouse station, whilst to the east the DLR splits, with one branch going to Poplar station and the other to West India Quay station"
"The DLR station was built midway between the site of the old Limehouse and West India Docks stations on the disused London and Blackwall Railway. Limehouse Police Station is nearby, as is St Anne's Church, built by Nicholas Hawksmoor and boasting London's tallest church clock tower."
Limehouse station
"Limehouse station is a railway station in Limehouse district of east London. The station is in Travelcard Zone 2. It is served by Docklands Light Railway (DLR) services and by National Rail services. The National Rail services are operated by c2c out of Fenchurch Street station. On the c2c route, Limehouse is between Fenchurch Street and West Ham stations. On the Docklands Light Railway, Limehouse is between Shadwell and Westferry stations."
History.
"The station was opened on 3 August 1840 as part of the London and Blackwall Railway. The area used to be known as Ratcliffe, whilst the station has been previously known as Stepney, Stepney Junction and later Stepney East station. Another station some distance to the east on the London and Blackwall Railway, open between 1840 and 1926, had previously been called Limehouse."
Limehouse station today.
"The current Limehouse station is to the west of Limehouse Basin, a marina and residential complex, and the Regent's Canal. Nearby is the north end of the Rotherhithe Tunnel, and the western end of the Limehouse Link tunnel. The station holds Secure Stations Scheme accreditation."
"According to train operators c2c, ""Limehouse is a bustling commuter station in the rush hour with passengers changing onto the Docklands Light Railway. At quieter times of day, it's an ideal stop-off point for Limehouse Basin and Thames-side walks through London's Docklands""."

Disease.
"For centuries, people around the world have used mass graves when many people died at once from epidemics of diseases. The goal of this type of mass grave is not to disrespect the bodies of the dead. The goal is to prevent disease from spreading from the dead to the living. Also, if too many people have died, it may be impossible to bury them all separately."
"For example, during outbreaks of the bubonic plague (""The Black Death"") in Europe, people were terrified of catching this disease from dead bodies. Often they buried plague victims in mass graves. Daniel Defoe, who lived during the Great Plague of London in 1655-1666, wrote about one mass grave:"
"However, at some mass graves for plague victims, people still tried to honor the dead with Christian burial traditions."
Disasters.
"More recently, victims of natural disasters have been buried in mass graves. Like with mass graves for disease victims, mass graves for disaster victims are not meant to disrespect the dead. In disasters where many people die, it may not be possible to bury each person one by one."
"For example, after 2010 Haiti earthquake, there were tens of thousands of bodies in the Haitian capital city of Port-au-Prince. In the first nine days after the earthquake, about 90,000 people were buried in mass graves, using bulldozers. There were so many bodies that there was no room, and not enough workers, to bury them one by one."
"One Haitian man, who helped bury 2,500 people in three mass graves, said: ""You have to understand that it's completely un-Haitian to dump bodies like this. We have extreme respect for the dead. And these people deserve a decent burial."" Later, he and other volunteers put up crosses to mark the graves, put holy water on the graves, and had a priest say prayers for the dead. Like at the mass graves for the plague victims, they were still trying to honor the dead, even though they had to bury them in mass graves."
"Some areas in Japan also had to use mass graves after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. In Japan, most people are cremated after they die. However, there were too many victims, and not enough kerosene to cremate them or dry ice to keep the bodies from decomposing. In one town, cremating all the town's victims would have taken 100 days. Because of this, some towns had to use mass graves to bury the dead."
Murder and genocide.
"Throughout history, people and governments that have murdered many people have buried them in mass graves. Unlike mass graves for victims of disease or disasters, this type of mass grave is often meant to disrespect the bodies of the dead after they are murdered."
Mass graves have been found from many of the international wars and civil wars in modern history. Here are a few examples.
World War I.
"During World War I, on July 19, 1916, about 2,300 British and Australian soldiers were killed in a battle with the German Army. In 2008, about 250 of their bodies were found in mass graves, where the Germans had buried them."
World War II.
The Holocaust.
"During The Holocaust, Nazi Germany killed six million Jewish people and millions of other people. Nobody knows exactly how many of these people are buried in mass graves. However, here are some examples of mass graves from Nazi murders:"
Soldiers' graves.
"During World War II, German soldiers who died when Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union were buried in mass graves in Eastern Europe. In 2013, the German War Graves Commission moved 70,000 soldiers from mass graves to a cemetery in Russia. This was the 82nd cemetery the Commission had built to re-bury soldiers buried in mass graves. All together, the 82 cemeteries hold more than 800,000 German soldiers. The Commission says there are at least 250,000 more German soldiers buried in mass graves throughout Eastern Europe."
"The Soviet Union also used mass graves during World War II. For example, in the Piskaryovskoye Memorial Cemetery, they buried almost 500,000 civilians and soldiers in 186 mass graves. These people had died or been killed during the Siege of Leningrad."
The Soviet Union.
"In the Soviet Union, as many as 20 million people may have died or been murdered while Joseph Stalin ruled the government. Most of them were Soviet civilians. Many were buried in mass graves."
The biggest include:
The Korean War.
"Early on in the Korean War, South Korea killed at least 100,000 people who had been put in prison for their political beliefs. They buried many of these people in mass graves. In 2007, the South Korean Truth and Reconciliation Committee found four mass graves, with more than 400 people in them. The Committee estimates that there are about 150 mass graves in South Korea."
The Vietnam War.
"During the Vietnam War, in the Huế Massacre, the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese Army murdered between 2,800 and 6,000 civilians and prisoners of war. They buried the bodies in dozens of mass graves."
Genocide in Cambodia.
"From 1975 to 1979, the Khmer Rouge, ruled by Pol Pot, controlled Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge committed a genocide against the Cambodian people. Historians and scientists say that there are at least 20,000 mass grave sites in the country, holding at least 1,386,734 victims of execution."
Other wars.
"During the Bosnian War (1992-1995), the Bosnian Serb Army killed more than 8,000 Bosnian Muslims in the Srebrenica genocide. They buried them in mass graves. In 2003, mass grave specialists found a mass grave that was ""as big as a tennis court."" It included victims of the Srebrenica genocide. By 2006, 42 mass graves had been found around Srebrenica, and specialists think there are at least 22 more. Another 2,070 victims have been found in the graves."
"During the Kosovo War (1998-1999), Serbian soldiers committed many war crimes against the Albanian people. As of 2010, six mass graves had been found in Serbia with Albanian victims inside. The largest had between 705 and 1,000 bodies in it."
"They hunt whales for their oil, made from their fat, called ""blubber"", and the meat. Today, there is a treaty which bans the hunt of some whale species. Most countries signed the treaty. A few countries still hunt whales for research purposes. Among those countries are Norway, Iceland and Japan."
Crayon
"Crayons are writing tools made with colored wax, water, and citric acid or chalk. Young children often use them to draw. Some adult artists use them too. They melt at a low temperature so they can be used in crayon-drip art. One very well-known brand of crayons is Crayola, a company by Binney and Smith."
Self-defence
"Self-defence means fighting off something or another person to protect yourself and maybe others. Ways of self-defence include martial arts or using a weapon. Sometimes, self-defense can cause serious harm to the other person. In most nations, you cannot be prosecuted for this harm. In the United States, an act of self-defence can only count as self-defence if the victim is in a situation that can cause them serious injury or death. In international law all persons have the right to self-defence."
Defence of others.
"The law of self-defence is the same when you protect others. Generally, you must have a good reason or belief that you needed to defend yourself in self-defence. However, in many places, if the court decides that the defence may have been too extreme, the person may face criminal and civil charges."
1913
"1913 (MCMXIII) was a common year starting on Wednesday of the Gregorian calendar, and a common year starting on a Tuesday in the 13-day slower Julian calendar. It was the 913th year of the 2nd Millennium, 13th year of the 20th Century and the 4th year of the 1910s decade."
1469
1469 was a common year.
Dodgeball
"Dodgeball is a sport played by throwing soft balls, or hard rubber balls, at people in a square court. The goal is to be the last one to be hit with the ball. Players may only throw balls at people who are not on their own team. If a player is hit by the ball,he or she should go to the outside of the court to the other team. From the outside, players throw the ball at players still on the inside."
"Dodgeball is often played in elementary schools in physical education classes. Many school children play this game. In recent years, many adults who played it as children have formed adult leagues and clubs. Also, some schools have banned it (this means that made it against the rules to play it), because players can get hurt when playing the game. Tournaments are sometimes held in schools."
"Dodgeball, because of its recent popularity, inspired a film """" (2004) starring Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn, and a game show, ""Extreme Dodgeball""."
Local area network
"A local area network (LAN) is a computer network in a small area like a home, office, or school. Many computers can be connected to share information and Internet connections. Most LANs use Ethernet to connect together."
Topology.
"LAN topologies tell you how ROM devices are organised. Five common LAN topologies exist: bus, ring, star, tree, and mesh. These topologies are logical architectures. This means that they tell you the directions that signals go between devices, but that the actual cables that connect the devices might not be connected the same way. For example, logical bus and ring topologies are commonly organized physically as a star."
Pharaoh
"Pharaohs were kings of ancient Egypt. The word comes from the Coptic language word ""Per-aa"", which means ""Great House"". Pharaohs were believed to be descended from the gods."
"The Valley of the Nile had been lived in by early humans for at least 700,000 years. The area has a long history of human civilization, but Egypt as a state begins in about 5660 BC. At this time, the separate kingdoms of Upper and Lower Egypt were united."
"People studying Egyptian history have divided the pharaohs into 31 groupings, called dynasties. These dynasties were usually, but not always, based on a related family group. During the long period of the pharaoh's rule over Egypt, there were times when they did not control the whole country. This means that some dynasties only controlled part of the country, and another dynasty ruled another part at the same time. Also there are not complete records, so there are gaps in the lists of pharaohs, and it can be very difficult to list the rulers in chronological order. The origins of the first pharaohs survive only as legends."
"Before the union of Upper and Lower Egypt, kings wore crowns of different design, to show which part of Egypt they ruled. The red crown was worn in Lower Egypt. The white crown was worn in Upper Egypt. Later, kings of the whole of ancient Egypt wore a combination of the two crowns, called a Pschent."
"When a pharaoh died, their personal treasure was buried with them; not the treasure of the entire kingdom. The pharaohs were buried in large tombs, the largest and most famous were the Pyramids. Many later pharaohs were buried in the Valley of the Kings. Paintings and writings discovered in these tombs have provided much of our knowledge of the pharaohs. New discoveries, such as that in 2014 of a new dynasty ruled by a previously unknown pharaoh, Senebkay, are changing what we know about ancient Egypt. They were mostly men, but there were women such as Cleopatra and Nefertiti. Pharaohs were considered to be half-man and half-god."
"The body of the wild boar, when seen from the side, often looks very big. This impression is partly because, compared to the large body mass, the legs of the wild boar are short and do not look very strong. The wild boar's head is very large. Its eyes are high up on the head, while the ears are small with bristles around it. Its tail can move very quickly, and the wild boar often uses it to show when his mood. If seen from the front, the body looks quite narrow. The wild boar has 44 teeth in its jaw, which helps its strong bite. The male and the female wild boars' snout shapes are different."
Piglets.
A wild boar usually gives birth to about 4 – 6 piglets at a time. Piglets weigh from about 750 – 1000g when they are first born. They are fully weaned after 3 – 4 months. They begin eating solid foods such as worms and grubs after about 2 weeks.
In culture.
"Wild boar appears in European culture as symbol of warrior virtues. It also appears in Greek, Norse mythologies, vaishnavism, hinduism."
Narasimha
"Narasimha, according to Hinduism, was the fourth avatar of Vishnu. In this form, Vishnu had the body of a man, but he had a head of a lion. This avatar of Vishnu is also a symbol of great strength."
"The Hindu scriptures tell this story about Narashimha. There was a demon (a ""daitya"") named Hiranyakashipu. He was against all gods. But, his son named Prahlad used to worship the gods, especially Vishnu. Hiranyakashipu was not happy at his son and wanted to burn him to death. Hiranyakashipu also wanted to kill everyone who worshipped the gods and make everyone worship him instead. Vishnu became Narasimha, and protected Prahlad and other people who worshipped the gods by stopping Hiranyakashipu. Brahma had granted Hiranyakashipu a boon that kept him safe so that he could not be killed by a human, animal or deva. He also could not be killed in the day or night, or inside or outside of his palace. This made Hiranyakashipu believe that no one could kill him. When he wanted to kill his son for worshiping Vishnu, Vishnu came to earth incarnated as a half-man, half-lion creature (neither man nor human). This way Vishnu killed Hiranyakashipu in the twilight (neither day, nor night) and on the porch of the palace (neither inside, nor outside), without disrupting the boon given to him by Brahma. Now, Narasimha Jayanti is celebrated across the world."
Prahlada
"Hindus believe that Prahlada was a good person. He was the son of Hiranyakashipu, his evil father, and he worshipped Vishnu. Narasimha protected him from Hiranyakashipu."
Yuga
"Hindus believe that there are periods of time called yugas (""ages"" or ""eras""): Satya Yuga, Treta Yuga, Dvapara Yuga, and Kali Yuga. When Kali Yuga ends, a new Satya Yuga begins."
Vamana
"Hindus believe that Vishnu has many important avatars. The Vamana avatar was the fifth avatar. In this avatar, Vishnu was in the form of a human.Vamana avatar is basically in the form of a bramhin(a caste in hinduism which is responsible for ancient spiritual, cultural, educational activitiesand the highest in the Varnas) was taken for a demon king 'Bali'. Lord Vishnu in this avatar asked Bali to offer him 'three feet land' as a form of offering a king offered to a brahmin as a goodwill during ancient times in hindu culture. The story goes when king Bali captured the Adobe of hindu demigods and caused them a fierce battle. 'Aditi' - the mother figure of demigods in hinduism prayed to Lord Vishnu and pleased by her prayers, Lord Vishnu appeared and assured her a boon. In a thought of revenge , she wished that may Bali loose his whole wealth and power."""
"Lord Vamana (lord Vishnu) when asked Bali for three feet land then Bali laughed and said ""Brahamandeva (O Brahmin) you might have asked many luxurious things from me as dakshina but you asked such a menial thing of land of a three feet quantity?"" After which Lord Vamana grew so large in size as his one feet could cover whole Earth and other whole heaven! That means, whole land property of Bali was under control of lord Vamana. As per Bali's oath, there was no more land to donate and one feet of lord was remaining. Bali asked lord about who is greater, the thing or who gives the thing? Lord answer was the donar or giver of the thing is greater than the thing. Then king Bali asked the Lord to keep his third feet on his (Bali) head! Pleased by this act of Bali lord promised him the rule of 'Patal' (the underEarth) and promised to protect Bali and his kingdom and slay whosoever disobeys Bali in patal."
"It is believed that for 3 day during 'savan'or rainy season , king Bali returns to Earth. These three days are celebrated as Onam in Indian state of 'kerala'. During this festival , the idols of lord Vishnu and king bali are made out of rice and worshiped. A famous boat race is also organised across kerala in honour of king Bali. The people from every faith in kerala celebrate this feast. It is a regional festival of Keralites."
Parashurama
"Hindus believe that Vishnu has many important avatars. The Parashurama also known as parshurama avatar was the sixth important avatar. In this avatar, Vishnu was in the form of a human. He came to Earth to stop bad people. He was the son of sage Jamdagni, a sage who was known for his temper. It is believed that parashurma was cheiranjiv it means that he was immortal. He was the great devotee of Lord Shiva. Parshurama's mother Renuka Devi was daughter of kshatriya after receiving Parashurma from Lord Shiva as a boon it was impossible to defeat parashurma in Earth. He was the first brahmakshatriya (both brahmin and kshatriya warrior)"
It is said that he was born before the Lord Rama and still he is alive.In Mahabharata he tought
Dronacharya Bhishma and karna.It is believed that he will teach war skills to the tenth avatar of Vishnu (kalki) once he cutt of the right tusk of Lord Ganesha.
Because Ganesha was not letting him in to meet Lord Shiva when Goddess Parvati and Lord Shiva grew up with anger after hearing this but after they forgive parashurma.
Balarama
"Hindus believe that Balram was the older brother of Krishna. Some Hindus believe that he is an avatar of Vishnu’s shesh naag. In this avatar, Shesh naag was in the form of a human."
Ba Ðình Square
"Ba Đình Square (Vietnamese: Quảng Trường Ba Đình) is a place in the Vietnamese capital, Hà Nội. It is where Vietnamese President Hồ Chí Minh declared the independence of the Democratic Republic of Việt Nam from French imperialist rule on 2 September 1945, the same day that World War II ended. This is now where his mausoleum is."
"These missions were an important part of Spanish rule because if a mission was built in a place, it would be harder for other European countries to claim that land for themselves."
"In these missions, the Native Americans were taught European ways. They learned how to speak Spanish and the basics of the Catholic faith. They also farmed and made things such as candles and clothes. However, some Native Americans did not like living in the missions. They thought the Spanish were treating them wrong and they fought back."
Death.
"Serra died at Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo in what is now Carmel-by-the-Sea, California. He is buried there. People go to his grave to pray in his name."
Sainthood.
"Serra was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1988. When he was beatified, it means that the Catholic Church recognizes that he went to heaven and can intercede on behalf of people who pray in his name. He was also now called ""Blessed."" However, he was not a saint yet because beatification is step 3 out of the 4 steps of becoming a saint in the Catholic Church."
"In 2015, Pope Francis canonized Serra. That means that he is now officially recognized as a saint in the Catholic Church and has his own feast day (July 1 in the United States, August 28 everywhere else). July 1 is his feast day in America to honor the day he arrived in San Diego."
Legacy.
"There are many statues of Junipero Serra in California. There are also many places named after him, such as schools and roads."
Criticism.
"People have criticized Junipero Serra for his treatment of the Native people who live in what is now the state of California. They said that he beat them up and didn't allow them to practice their own cultures and religions. However, other people say that Serra did a lot of good things for the Native people. Unlike other Europeans at the time, he thought that the Native Californians had souls. He also taught them how to read and write."
"In 2020, many statues of Junipero Serra were damaged and pulled down. Other statues of him have been removed and put away. These events have taken place in light of the George Floyd protests, when people were working to end racism in American society."
Preludes (Chopin)
"Preludes, Op. 28 is a collection of 24 short musical works for solo piano, written by Frédéric Chopin between 1837 and 1838 and published in the middle of 1839, just after the composer's winter stay on the isle of Majorca with George Sand."
"Chopin was greatly influenced by Johann Sebastian Bach when he wrote these preludes. Each of the works in the collection is in a different major or minor key, with not one being left out, just like Bach's 24 preludes and fugues in ""The Well-Tempered Clavier"". But unlike Bach, Chopin arranges the preludes in order through the circle of fifths. The first prelude in the set is in C major, the next in A minor, then G major, E minor, and so on, until the last two, which are in F major and finally D minor."
"The ""Preludes"" are all very different. Many are very short (they take only about one minute each to play), so the atmosphere changes quickly, and this can make the overall structure seem out of place. Artists have recorded the entire set of preludes on CDs, and they are often performed in concerts as well."
"One of the well-known pieces from the ""Preludes"" is Prelude No. 15, in D-flat major and nicknamed ""Raindrop"". This nickname refers to the monotonous repetition of one note in the accompaniment. It reminded early music lovers of the dripping of raindrops. Another well-known number is Prelude No. 4, in E minor, with its melancholy descending chords in the accompaniment."
"Besides the 24 preludes of Op. 28, Chopin would write three more preludes, Op. 45 in C-sharp minor (composed in 1841), one in A-flat major (1834), and the so-called ""Devil's Trill"" Prelude, in E-flat minor, which Chopin never ended up finishing."
Union Kleinmünchen
"Union Kleinmünchen Linz is a women soccer club from Linz, Upper Austria. It was founded in 1980 and was the first club, which is a pure women soccer club. The colours of the team are red and white."
History.
The club was founded in 1980 and started playing in the highest league. From 1980 till 2008 they played each season in the highest class. The season 2008/09 they played for the first time in the 2. league but next season (2009/10) they could reach the championship and were promoted to the ÖFB-Frauenliga.
Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)
"Symphony No. 6 in F major, Op. 68 (Pastorale) is a symphony by Ludwig van Beethoven. The composer began making sketches for the symphony in 1806. The symphony was completed in 1808 in the village of Heiligenstadt northwest of Vienna. It was first performed in Vienna, Austria on 22 December 1808 in the Theater an der Wien with the premieres of the Symphony No. 5 in C minor, the Piano Concerto No. 4 in G major, the ""Choral"" Fantasy, ""Ah! perfido!"" (a concert aria composed in 1796), and excerpts from the Mass in C major of 1807."
"There are five movements in the symphony. The movements in order are allegro ma non troppo (""Joyful Feelings Upon Arriving in the Country""), andante molto mosso (""By the Brook""), allegro (""Peasant Merrymaking""), allegro (""The Thunderstorm""), and allegretto (""The Shepherd's Song After the Storm""). The first movement is in sonata form. It is placid and cheerful. It depicts the composer's feelings as he arrives in the country. The second movement is in sonata form. Beethoven helpfully identified the bird species in the score: nightingale (flute), quail (oboe) and cuckoo (clarinet). The third movement is the scherzo movement of the symphony. It depicts the country folk dancing and it ends unexpectedly when the country folk notice that raindrops are starting to fall. The fourth movement depicts a violent thunderstorm, starting with just a few drops of rain and building to a climax. There is, of course, thunder, as well as lightning, high winds, and sheets of rain. The finale is in sonata rondo form. The first eight bars form a continuation of the introduction of which the storm was the main part; the finale proper begins in the ninth bar."

"Roseanna's Grave (also known as For Roseanna) is a 1997 American romantic dramedy film directed by Paul Weiland. In his review, Roger Ebert concludes that ""Roseanna's Grave"" ""isn't of much consequence, perhaps, and the gears of the plot are occasionally visible as they turn. But it's a small, sweet film that never tries for more than it's sure of, and the actors find it such a relief to be playing such goodhearted characters that we can almost feel it."""

Serial-position effect
"The serial position effect is a psychological phenomenon. It say that people are more likely to remember the first and last items on a list. They are less likely to remember the middle items. The term was created in 1913 by Herman Ebbinghaus. He was a German psychologist who was interested in testing his ability to remember items on a list. This ability is called free-recall. Ebbinghaus performed free-recall experiments on himself. He used a list of 2000 syllables. THe experiments showed him that the where the it was on the list affected how well he could remember it. This information is shown in the ""serial position curve"". The serial position curve shows two things. The first thing it showed him was that the first 2-3 items on the list and up to the last 8 items in a list are always remembered better than items in the middle. This was true in any list with 20 or more items. It also showed him that the size of the list and the speed at which it was preseted did not affect the outcome."
Free Recall.
"Free recall is a way of experimenting that is used in psychology. It is used to test memory. Free recall is the most common method of studying the serial position effect. to use free recakk, a person is shown a list of items. These items are normally words. The person is then asked to say which items they can remember from the list in any order. One major problem with this method is that the tests are usually done in a controlled environment. This means the result may not be different from what happens in the real world."
Primacy effect.
"The primary effect is the term used to mean that people often remember the first thing they are told. Many psychologists think that this effect may be a result of rehearsal. When a person is trying to remember the items, that person will often repeat the items to themselves. As each item is added to the list, they repeat the entire list. This causes them to repeat the first it many time. This constant repeating helps them to better remember the items at the begining of the list,The slower the list is presented, the more time a person has to repeat the list. This causes a larger primacy effect."
"In the 1970s, psychologists began testing the effect of rehearsal on the primacy effect. In 1972, psychologist Phillip Marshal tested if removing rehearsal would have an affect on the primacy effect. He did this by having the people sort the words while he was giving them a list of 18 common nouns. The people in the test were not told that their memmory was being tested. Since they did not know this, they did not repeat the words as they heard them. The experiments showed Marshal that removing the repeating also removed most of the primacy effect. It showed that rehearsal was a main cause for the primacy effect."
"In 1971, Dewey Rundus created a what he called ""overt rehearsal"" The people were told to say their thoughts out loud, This tested test ""how"" and ""when"" participants rehearsed each item in a list. In 1977, Brodie and Murdock used overt rehearsal to give an alternate explanation for the primacy effect. They learned that even as people got towards the end of the list, they were still repeating the first terms. This caused the items to still be inthe person's short-term memory (STM) near the end of the list. This created what is called a ""recency effect"". Brodie and Murdock said that rehearsal is a main cause of the primacy effect. They also believed that the primacy effect may be a type of ""recency effect""."
Recency effect.
"The recency effect is the ability to remember items near the end of a list. Unlike the primacy effect, changes in speed and the size of the list do not affect the recency effect. Psychologists have learned that asking people to list the items in the ‘order they were presented’ causes less recency effect. In a 1966 study, Glanzer and Kunitz learned that increasing the time between when the list is presented and when recall is tested can affect the recency effect. With just an added 30 second delay, there was no longer a recency effect. In 1990, researchers tried to distract the people during the test. They would have the person do something that stopped short-term memory (rehearsal). For example, they would have the person countbackward from 3. The results showed that this also removed the recency effect."

Bumblebee
"Bumblebees or ""bumble bees"", or ""humble bees"") are a group of social and semi-social bees, of the genus Bombus. The genus contains about 250 different species, mostly in the Northern Hemisphere. They can also be found in New Zealand and Tasmania. They occur practically everywhere on the Eurasian landmass."
"Most bumblebees live in small groups, which generally last only for a year (though the queen lasts longer). They collect pollen as protein for their young, and themselves eat nectar. They are extremely hairy, with a covering of soft hairs called a ""pile"". It is the female worker bee which one sees out collecting pollen. The pollen is packed into two ""baskets"" on its hind, very noticeable when full. The baskets are just hairs specially adapted for this function."
"Most of them have the same social structure as honey bees do, there is a ""queen"", and there are ""workers"" and ""drones"". The usual size of a colony is under 50 members, though some tropical species live in larger colonies."
"Bumblebees carry aposematic warning colours, usually some combination of black, red, yellow and white. This is the usual Müllerian mimicry found in bees and wasps. Bumblebees are extremely hairy, and that also is a defence against birds. Young birds, particularly, find them difficult to handle. Some birds are regular predators of bumblebees: the great grey shrike (""Lanius excubitor"") and the bee-eaters for example."
Life cycle.
"Fertilised queens overwinter in a dormant state. They start a nest in the Spring. The nests are smaller, usually much smaller, than those of hive bees. The queen stores sperm from her mating, and can decide whether or not to fertilise an egg as it comes down the oviduct to the vagina. The females are diploid, the males are haploid. This is the common method of sex determination throughout the Hymenoptera."
"Only fertilised eggs grow into females, unfertilised ones grow into males. To develop, the larvae are fed both nectar for carbohydrates and pollen for protein."
"Queens suppress their female workers egg-laying by aggression and pheromones, until late in the season, when the workers do start to lay eggs. The eggs develop into males (drones) if they are not fertilised (haploid), and females if they are diploid."
"Thus the queen will be the mother of all the first males. New queens (those fertilised eggs which are fed on nutritious food) and males leave the colony when they are mature. They mate and the new queens search for a place to overwinter. Then they are dormant over the winter period, starting a new nest in the Spring. That completes the cycle. The queens live a number of years. The workers (unfertilized females) live about a season. Drones live away from the hive(s). Queens do not mate with drones from their own hive."
"Bumblebees can fly very high. In 2014, ""National Geographic"" said bumblebees can fly higher than Mount Everest."
Nest size.
"Nest size ""according to the species"" is between 50 and 400 individuals. Colonies have been fiund as small as ~20 individuals and as large as 1700. These nests are small compared to honeybee hives, which hold about 50,000 bees."
Nest types.
"Many species nest underground in old rodent burrows or sheltered places. They avoid direct sunlight, where nests might overheat. Other species make nests above ground, whether in thick grass or in holes in trees. Stone-boring bees are found in limestone walls and cliffs, and sand borers are found in compact sand cliffs."
"A bumblebee nest is not organised into hexagonal combs like that of a honeybee; the cells are instead clustered together untidily. The workers remove dead bees or larvae from the nest and deposit them outside the nest entrance, helping to prevent disease. Nests in temperate regions last only for a single season and do not survive the winter."
Parasitic bees.
"About ten species are called cuckoo bumblebees. These are nest parasites: they specialize in invading and taking over the nests of other bumblebees. In these species, there are no workers. Once such an animal has invaded a nest, it will force the workers to feed it and its offspring. Once the offspring are ready, they will leave the hive, to mate and take over other hives."
Sting.
"All bumblebees have a sting, as hive bees do. However, the bumblebee sting does not damage it when used, and they can sting several times. However, they rarely do sting, unless really threatened."
"They have an additional type of defence against birds, and that is their mechanical toughness. Birds usually do not swallow bees whole. If they eat bees at all, they manipulate them to eat the thorax alone, for its wing muscles. This is hard to do with a bumblebee, and time-consuming. Generally, they are left alone."

Invention
"An invention is a new thing that someone has made. The computer was an invention when it was first made. We say when it was ""invented"". New things that are made or created are called inventions. Cars and plastics are inventions that everyone knows. Inventions are made by inventors. Many inventions are patented."
"Ideas are also called inventions. Writers can invent characters, and then invent a story about them."
Inventing.
"Over time, humans have invented objects which make life easier for themselves. Because of this, a quote ""necessity is the mother of invention"", was written. The quote means that a lack of something should inspire someone to create something to fill that empty space. However, not all people believe that this is true. They think that too much of something can lead to an invention."
Many inventions are just a variation of something that already exists.
Genocide
"Genocide is the crime of killing many people who are all part of one ethnic or religious group, or some sort of similar group, and trying to destroy that group. Genocide is done usually by a group, such as a government, or military group, not by one person or a small number of people. Usually, the motivation for genocide is based on political reason."
"The word genocide was made up by Raphael Lemkin, a Polish Jew, in 1944, from the words ""genos"" (Greek for family, tribe or race) and ""-cide"" (from the Latin ""occidere"", to kill). It was first used to the Nazi Holocaust, when many groups, including Jews and others, were killed."
Ustashe of Croatia are another example of genocidial horror. About a million of Serbs were killed in WWII in Ustashe concentration camps especially in Jasenovac. Another example of genocide was when about a million of the Tutsi group of people of Rwanda were killed along with Hutus who were against the genocide in 1994.
"In 1933 Lemkin made a speech to the Legal Council of the League of Nations conference on international criminal law in Madrid, for which he prepared an essay on the ""Crime of Barbarity"" as a crime against international law. The purpose of the crime, which later evolved into the idea of genocide, was based mostly on the experience of Assyrians massacred in Iraq on 11 August 1933. The event in Iraq reminded him of earlier similar events of the Armenian Genocide during World War I."
"Today, any genocide is prohibited by the Genocide Convention and actor or inciter of genocide is judged by the International Criminal Court."
Examples.
Today most people see the following events as genocide. Note that the events listed are just examples.
Yoko Ono
"is a Japanese musician and artist. She is the widow of John Lennon. Before she married Lennon she was married to Toshi Ichiyanagi from 1956 to 1963 and Anthony Cox from 1963 to 1969. She has two children, Kyoko Chan Cox (with Cox) and Sean Lennon (with Lennon)."
Early life.
"Both of her parents came from wealthy families. Her father, who was a descendant of a former Emperor of Japan, had been a concert pianist before giving up music to become a banker. Ono was tutored privately, then sent to exclusive private schools, studying classical music and art, and also learning English. She visited the United States before World War II with her family. Her father was on a business trip to the U.S. when the war began, and was with many other Japanese in the country. He was not able to communicate with his family for many years. Ono's mother took her, her brother and sister away from Tokyo, and they stayed in a rural area."
"After the war ended, the family was reunited, and moved to New York for her father's job. Ono enrolled in Sarah Lawrence College, but quit during her third year. She became interested in art and music, and began writing poetry. Many of her poems were instructions, for creating pieces of art. She later published some of these in a book, titled ""Grapefruit"". Her parents were not happy that Ono chose to make her own way, rather than following her family's wishes for her life. When she married Toshi Ichiyanagi, a young pianist, her parents her."
"The marriage did not work out, and Ono rented a loft apartment of her own. She became friends with local artists in New York, including Andy Warhol and a group called Fluxus. She hosted small parties and ""happenings"" for her artist friends, and began to do artwork of her own. This brought her some notoriety in time, but not fame. She remarried, to Tony (Anthony) Cox, and they had a daughter, named Kyoko."
Marriage to Lennon.
"Ono went to London with Cox and Kyoko during 1966, to promote her career as an artist. John Lennon, who was a member of The Beatles, went to one of her art shows. He enjoyed the (fantasy-like) quality of her work. Ono and Lennon became friends, and later lovers, as each lost interest in their spouses. Lennon wanted them to be together as much as possible. He broke a rule the Beatles had never to bring a wife or girlfriend to their recording sessions. He brought her along anytime he could. They were married in March 1969, after they were both divorced."
"Many Beatles fans blamed Ono for ""breaking up"" the band through her influence on Lennon. He seemed to many people to have ""gone crazy"" since meeting her. Some suggest that Ono simply encouraged Lennon to do things he'd already wanted to do, but let himself be talked out of doing in the past – including quitting the Beatles. Ono and Lennon started a new, part-time group they called the Plastic Ono Band. They also tried to have a baby together. Ono miscarried several times, until their son Sean Lennon was born in 1975, on Lennon's 35th birthday. Ono was also able to with her family, during the 1970s."
"Ono was Lennon's ""muse"", inspiring his music and his creative side, for the rest of his life. The two worked together on both his post-Beatles records, and Ono's wish to also have a music career. She was more interested in ""experimental"" music than in classical or popular music. Ono's songs and unique style sounded strange to most listeners. It was offensive to many people, who thought Lennon should have either stayed with the Beatles, or made more music in their style. Ono changed her style, and began to write and record more pop songs, but her music never became popular. Years later, some younger musicians (such as The B-52's) admitted they had liked Ono's music. They were inspired by it, as Lennon had been."
Since 1980s.
"After Lennon's murderer in 1980, Ono recorded several solo albums. The first was titled ""Season of Glass"". Her later records were praised by some music critics."
"When Sean Lennon grew up, he also became a musician. He helped Ono to compile (collect and put in order) her old recordings, and make some new ones. She also revived some of her earlier artwork, and gave the money made from sales and exhibits to charities. Ono recently (2006) appeared at the opening of ""Love"", a Cirque du Soleil show featuring Beatles music, to help promote it."
"Water is also used for recreational purposes, ""see list of water sports""."
Water is used as both the coolant and the neutron moderator in most nuclear reactors. This may be ordinary water (called light water in the nuclear industry) or heavy water.
"Water is also used for washing a lot of objects. Goods, services and people are transported to other countries in watercrafts on bodies of water."
Water is used in chemical reactions as a solvent or reactant. Water is also used in fire fighting. Water is also used for cooking.
Dihydrogen monoxide parody.
"The dihydrogen monoxide parody involves calling water by the unfamiliar chemical name ""dihydrogen monoxide"" (DHMO) and listing some of its harmful effects in an alarming way. Some examples include talking about how ""it causes burning, suffocation and corrosion,"" when it is actually just talking about hot water, drowning and rust. Sometimes the parody calls for it to be banned and/or labelled as dangerous."
The prank works because it takes advantage of people's misunderstanding. Calling water by an unfamiliar name and making it sound like a harmful chemical can make people think it is dangerous.
"""Dihydrogen monoxide"" is an alternative chemical name for water, but nobody uses it. The word ""dihydrogen"" means two hydrogens, and ""monoxide"" means one oxygen. The chemical formula of water has two hydrogens and one oxygen."
"The parody gained most of its popularity in the 1990s, when a 14-year-old named Nathan Zohner collected anti-DHMO petitions for a science project about gullibility. Zohner fooled a lot of people, which has led to his project being used in lessons about critical thinking and the scientific method."
"The website DHMO.org is a joke website which lists the harmful effects of water (DHMO), answers questions, and calls for it to be banned, among other things."
Origin of the Earth's water.
The weirdness of water.
"A BBC short item explains that every molecule on Earth has existed for billions of years, and all of them came from elsewhere. Water is alien because it arrived on asteroids and comets. It is the second most common molecule in the universe. Why is it not a gas? It is made of two very light elements. Ice floating on water is also an oddity. Also, hot water freezes faster than cold, and no-one knows why this is. Molecules of water can move up against the force of gravity (that is due to surface adhesion)."
Water in the universe.
Much of the universe's water is produced as a by-product of star formation.
"On 22 July 2011, a report described the discovery of a gigantic cloud of water vapor containing ""140 trillion times more water than all of Earth's oceans combined"" around a quasar located 12 billion light years from Earth. According to the researchers, the ""discovery shows that water has been prevalent in the universe for nearly its entire existence""."
"Water has been detected in interstellar clouds in our galaxy, the Milky Way. Water probably exists in abundance in other galaxies, too. Its components, hydrogen and oxygen, are among the most abundant elements in the universe. Most other planetary systems are likely to have similar ingredients."
Origin of water on Earth: Possibilities.
"We do not know exactly how the Earth came to have so much water. It is everywhere in the Universe, but it is uncommon for a place to have so much. Reasoning from first principles, every element except hydrogen has been formed in stars. Therefore, oxygen was originally formed in stars. The formation of water is not a problem: it is exothermic, so forming the molecule from its atoms does not need outside energy. But to explain why the Earth has so much compared to, for example, Mars, is not easy. It is an undecided problem in planetary geology."
"For a while, people thought Earth’s water did not come from the planet’s region of the protoplanetary disk. Instead, it was thought that water and other volatiles must have been delivered to Earth from the outer Solar System later in its history. But hydrogen inside the Earth did play some role in the formation of the ocean. The two ideas may each be partly right. Water was delivered to Earth by impacts from icy planetesimals (asteroids) in the outer edges of the asteroid belt. How much is not known."
Water Vapor.
Water vapor is the gas form of water and is found in:
Liquid Water.
"Liquid water is found on Earth. It covers about 71% of the surface of the Earth. Liquid water is sometimes found in small amounts on Mars. Scientists believe that liquid water is in the moons Enceladus, Titan, Europa and Ganymede."
Frozen Water.
The frozen form of water (ice) is found in:
Want
"A want is a wish or a desire for something. If a person would like to have something, but can choose not to have it, that thing is wanted or can be called a want. To want is not the same as to need, which is when someone ""must"" have something."
"People often talk about needing a thing, when they really just want it. Wants can be for the same things as needs. For example, a person can ""need"" to eat food and can ""want"" to eat cake. If there is no cake then he or she may have to eat something else, perhaps bread. The need is no longer so important (the person is no longer hungry) although the want may still be there. If there is cake, then the person's needs and wants can both be met."
"In economics, a want is about goods or services. Choice is how to satisfy a want, when there are different ways to do this."
"Want can also be the idea of what it means to be poor, hungry or with no money. Charles Dickens wrote a famous book called ""A Christmas Carol"" in which there are two children, named Want and Ignorance."
It has a number of Grade II listed buildings. An example is the Parish Church of St Thomas in Bath Street. It is listed as Grade II*.
"Very old documents refer to a small dwelling in the area called ""Ty'n Rhyl"". There is a manor house with that name that still exists in the town."
Mesh networking
"Mesh networking is a kind of network topology, a way computer networks and other networks are laid out. In mesh networking, each node is connected to one or more other nodes. Information is passed from one node to the next, until it reaches its target destination. Such networks can be very reliable because there is usually more than one path from one node to another. When a node fails, the data will simply take another route."
"The disadvantage of such networks is that building them can be very expensive. A network in which each node is directly connected to every other node is called a fully connected network. Another type of a mesh network is a mobile ad hoc network. In such a network the nodes are mobile, and the network may reorganize itself while it is running."
"According to Reed's Law, the value of fully meshed networks is proportional to the exponent of the number of subscribers. Metcalf's Law, in contrast asserts that the value is proportional to the square of the number of subscibers."
The Emperor's New Clothes
"""The Emperor's New Clothes"" is a story by Hans Christian Andersen. The tale was first published on 7 April 1837 with ""The Little Mermaid"" in the third and final installment of Andersen's ""Fairy Tales Told for Children"". It was published in Copenhagen, Denmark by C. A. Reitzel. The story is based on one from the ""Libro de los ejemplos del conde Lucanor y de Patronio|Libro de los ejemplos"" (or ""El Conde Lucanor"", 1335) by Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena (1282–1348). This book was a medieval Spanish collection of fifty-one cautionary tales with various sources such as Aesop and other classical writers and Persian folktales. Andersen did not know the Spanish original, but read the tale in a German translation titled ""So ist der Lauf der Welt"". In the source tale, a king is hoodwinked by weavers who claim to make a suit of clothes invisible to any man not the son of his presumed father. Andersen altered the source tale to direct the focus on courtly pride and intellectual vanity rather than adulterous paternity."
"Andersen's manuscript was at the printer’s when he suddenly changed the original climax of the tale from the emperor’s subjects admiring his invisible clothes to that of the child's cry. Andersen’s decision to change the ending may have occurred after he read the manuscript tale to a child, or had its source in a childhood incident similar to that in the tale. In 1872, he recalled standing in a crowd with his mother waiting to see King Frederick VI. When the king made his appearance, Andersen cried out, ""Oh, he’s nothing but a human being!"" His mother tried to silence him by crying, ""Have you gone mad, child?"". Whatever the reason, Andersen thought the change would prove more satirical."
"The story tells of an Emperor who cares for nothing but new clothes. He hires two swindlers who promise him the finest suit of clothes. It will be made from a fabric invisible to anyone who is unfit for his position or ""hopelessly stupid"". The Emperor's ministers cannot see the clothing, but pretend that they can for fear of appearing unfit for their positions. The Emperor does the same. Finally the swindlers report that the suit is finished. They pretend to dress Emperor. He marches in procession before his subjects. The townsfolk play along with the pretense. Then a child in the crowd cries out that the Emperor is wearing nothing at all. The cry is taken up by others. The Emperor cringes, but holds his head high and continues the procession."
Shabbat
"Shabbat is the name of the day of rest in Judaism. Shabbat happens on the seventh day (Saturday) of every week. In Judaism, the day is defined with the cycle of the sun: The day begins and ends at sunset, not midnight. So the seventh day of the week, Shabbat, begins Friday when the sun goes down, and ends Saturday night after it gets dark. The idea of Shabbat comes from the Bible's story of Creation. In that story, God creates the Universe and everything on Earth for six days. On the seventh day, he stops work. In the same way, Jews work on the first six days of the week and rest on the seventh day, Shabbat."
"The word ""Shabbat"" began as a Hebrew word (). The English word ""Sabbath"" comes from the word ""Shabbat"". The English word can also be used to refer to Shabbat. The Christian idea of Sabbath came from the Jewish idea of Shabbat. Now, there are many differences between them."
"The first part of the Jewish Bible, the Torah, says that work is not allowed on Shabbat. It is a day to rest and study the Torah."
"In Jewish law, Shabbat is the most important Jewish holiday. It is even more important than Passover, Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Jewish mystics say that the Shabbat day is meant to be like a perfect world. In this world, everyone knows about God and loves him. They believe that kind of world has not been seen since the Garden of Eden, and will not be seen again until the Messiah comes."
Two parts of Shabbat: celebrating and guarding.
"There are two versions of the Ten Commandments in the Bible. These versions use different words. The version in Exodus says ""Remember Shabbat to keep it holy."" The version in Deuteronomy says ""Guard Shabbat to keep it holy."" Jewish custom says that ""remember"" means to ""celebrate"" Shabbat. ""Guard"" means ""resting""—not working or doing business."
Celebrating Shabbat.
Shabbat is a happy day. There are many ceremonies of Shabbat that help people celebrate the happiness of the day.
Guarding Shabbat—rest and work on Shabbat.
"Enjoying Shabbat is very important, but Shabbat is a holy day. There are laws and rules in the Torah, the Mishnah and the Talmud about what Jews may and may not do on Shabbat. These laws help Jews keep Shabbat as a holy day."
Shabbat in non-Orthodox Judaism.
"Conservative Judaism also teaches Jews not to do activities in the 39 prohibited categories of work ""(melacha)."" Conservative rabbis are often less strict about what is ""melacha"" than Orthodox rabbis are. Conservative rabbis are almost always less strict about what is a prevention ""(shevut)"" than Orthodox rabbis. For example, Conservative rabbis allow Jews to use electricity on Shabbat for many purposes. They do not allow Jews to use electricity to do any of the 39 prohibited categories of work."
"Many, if not most, ""lay members"" (not rabbis or prayer leaders) of Conservative synagogues in North America do not follow these laws. Progressive Judaism, including Reform Judaism, does not accept Jewish law as binding. These Jews may rest on Shabbat, but are not usually strict about not doing ""melacha"" or ""shevut."" They may even add practices not allowed under Orthodox Jewish law that they think improves their celebration of Shabbat. For example, they may drive to synagogue on Shabbat, or may use musical instruments on Shabbat. Orthodox Judaism does not allow either of those actions on Shabbat."
Havdalah: Ending Shabbat.
"Shabbat ends after dark on Saturday night. The end of Shabbat is marked by a ceremony called ""Havdalah"" (). This is a Hebrew word meaning ""division"" or ""separation"". The ceremony ""divides"" or ""separates"" the holy day of Shabbat from the new week. The ""Havdalah"" blessings are spoken over a cup of wine. The ""Havdalah"" ceremony also uses spices with a nice smell and a candle with many ""wicks"" (cloth strings for lighting). After ""Havdalah"", people start doing regular weekday things again."

"Male ostriches can be 1.8 - 2.7 meters / 6 – 9 feet tall, while female ostriches are 1.7 – 2 meters / 5.5 - 6.5 ft tall. They can run with a speed of about 65 kilometers per hour/40 miles per hour."
Habitat.
"]Ostriches now only live in Africa. They live in open grassland called savanna in the Sahel, and in parts of East Africa and south-west Africa. Some ostriches live in areas of the Sahara desert. There used to be ostriches in Middle East in the 20th century and, further back, also"
Food.
"Ostriches mainly eat plant matter, but they also eat insects. The plant matter consists of seeds, shrubs, grass, fruits and flowers while the insects they eat include locusts. Ostriches do not have teeth, and so cannot grind food as mammals do. Instead, they swallow pebbles. An adult ostrich carries about 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) of stones in its gizzard, a special sac just before the stomach. The pebbles grind the food, and help its digestion. When eating, their gullet is filled with food. After that, the food is passed down their esophagus in the form of a ball called a bolus. The bolus may be as much as 210 ml (7.1 US fl oz). Ostriches can live without drinking for several days."
Behaviour.
Social behavior.
"Ostriches normally spend the winter months in pairs or alone. During breeding season and sometimes during extreme rainless periods Ostriches live in nomadic groups of five to 50 birds (led by a top hen) that often travel together with other grazing animals, such as zebras or antelopes."
"With their acute eyesight and hearing, Ostriches can sense predators such as lions from far away. When being pursued by a predator, they have been known to reach speeds in excess of , and can maintain a steady speed of , which makes the Ostrich the world's fastest two-legged animal. When lying down and hiding from predators, the birds lay their heads and necks flat on the ground, making them appear as a mound of earth from a distance. This even works for the males, as they hold their wings and tail low so that the heat haze of the hot, dry air that often occurs in their habitat aids in making them appear as a nondescript dark lump."
"Ostriches can tolerate a wide range of temperatures. In much of their habitat, temperatures vary as much as between night and day. Their temperature control mechanism relies on action by the bird, which uses its wings to cover the naked skin of the upper legs and flanks to conserve heat, or leaves these areas bare to release heat."
Reproduction.
Ostriches become sexually adults when they are 2 to 4 years old; females are adults about six months younger than males. The mating process differs in different places. Territorial males hiss and use other sounds to claim mating rights over a harem of two to seven hens.
"Fights usually last just minutes, but the ostriches can kill each other by slamming their heads into opponents. The winning male will then mates with all the females in the area, but he will only form a pair bond with the dominant female."
"The females lay their eggs in one shared nest, a pit dug into the ground, deep and wide. The male ostrich digs the pit. The dominant female lays her eggs first, and when it is time to cover them to keep them warm, she pushes the eggs from the weakest females out. Most of the time, she leaves about 20 in most cases."
"Ostrich eggs are the largest of all eggs (and the yolk is the largest single cell), but they are actually the smallest eggs relative to the size of the adult bird. — on average they are long, wide, and weigh , over 20 times the weight of a chicken egg. The eggs are incubated by the females by day and by the males by night. This uses the colouration of the two sexes to escape detection of the nest, as the drab female blends in with the sand, while the black male is nearly undetectable in the night. The incubation period is 35 to 45 days."
"Males and females cooperate in rearing chicks. The male defends the hatchlings and teaches them to feed. The survival rate is low for the hatchlings, with an average of one per nest surviving to adulthood."
Predators.
"When threatened, the ostrich will either hide itself by lying flat against the ground, or will run away. If cornered, it can attack with a kick from its powerful legs. Common predators of nests and young ostriches include jackals, various birds of prey, mongoose and vultures. Animals that prey on ostriches of all ages include cheetahs, lions, leopards, african dogs, and spotted hyena. Ostriches can often outrun their predators in a pursuit and can even outpace cheetahs over long distances. However, they may sometimes fight fiercely against predators, especially when chicks are being defended. They have sometimes killed lions in such fights."
Evolution.
"There is no doubt that the ratites are not a monophyletic group, because they are not descended from a single ancestor. That means the taxonomy of the group is going to change, and they will not all be placed in the Order Struthioniformes as they have been. However, as ornothologists have not yet agreed on a new classification, for the time being the useful term 'ratites' is still used."
Unusual morphology.
"Ostriches are likely to be placed alone in the order Struthioniformes. They have a number of peculiarities which suggest a separate evolution from the rest of the ratites. They lack a gallbladder. They have three stomachs, and the caecum is long. Unlike all other living birds, the Ostrich secretes uric acid separately from faeces. Unlike all other birds, who store the uric acid and faeces together, and excrete them together, ostriches store the faeces at the end of their rectum. They also have unique pubic bones that are fused to hold their gut. Unlike most birds the males have a penis, which is retractable and long. Their palate (bone on the roof of the mouth) differs from other ratites."
Ostriches and humans.
"Ostriches are farmed in several countries. They used to be prized for their feathers, but are now farmed for their meat and eggs. Their skin can also be used to make leather."
"In South Africa, hunters can get one group of feathers from one wild ostrich. When they are farmed, every seven or eight months farmers can take groups of feathers from the ostriches. They will grow back and can be collected again a in seven or eight more months."
"When threatened, Ostriches run away, but they can cause serious injury and death with kicks from their powerful legs. Their legs can only kick forward."
"Ostriches reared entirely by humans may not direct their courtship behaviour at other Ostriches, but toward their human keepers. Ostriches live 30 to 40 years on average."
"It is sometimes said that ostriches will hide their heads in the ground when they are scared or threatened, but this is not true."
Racing.
"In some countries, people race each other on the back of Ostriches. The practice is common in Africa and is relatively unusual elsewhere. The Ostriches are ridden in the same way as horses with special saddles, reins, and bits. However, they are harder to manage than horses."
Shark
Language.
"They speak the Ainu language. The Ainu language is classificated as language isolate, although there exist several theories about a genetic relation. Some linguists suggest a relation to Altaic languages while others suggest a link to Indo-European languages. Some similarities also exist with northern native American languages."
Iliad
"The Iliad is the oldest surviving work of Greek literature. It was an oral epic poem. People spoke it without reading it. It was written down in the 8th century BC. It is an epic (or very long) poem with 24 chapters written in hexameter. The poem includes early Greek myths and legends. It may have been based on a Bronze Age attack on the city Troy. People usually say that Homer wrote the ""Iliad"". However, scholars are not sure if the poem was really written by just one person."
"The story happens during the Trojan War, some time around 1200 BC. It talks about the confrontations of the warrior Achilles and King Agamemnon. The story is only about a few weeks at the end of the war, but it also talks about many of the Greek myths about the war. It tells the story from the wrath of Achilles, to the death and funeral of Hector and the siege of Troy."
"Together with another of Homer's poems, the ""Odyssey"", it is one of the two major Greek epic poems."
"Some important characters in the ""Iliad"" are Achilles, Odysseus, Agamemnon, Menelaus, Priam, Hector, Paris, and Helen."
Plot.
"The poem starts with the god Apollo sending a plague to the Greeks, because they captured the daughter of one of his Trojan priests. Agamemnon is forced to give the daughter back. So that he has a girl of his own, Agamemnon takes the captured Trojan girl Briseis from her owner Achilles. Achilles is angry and refuses to fight in the war. When Achilles' lover Patroclus is killed by Hector, Achilles starts to fight again and kills Hector in a duel. Later, Hector's father Priam comes in secret to Achilles to take back his favorite son's body to give it a proper funeral, which Achilles allows him to do. The poem ends with the funeral of Hector."
Drug
"According to the WHO, a drug is a substance that can change how a living organism works. Food is usually not seen as a drug, even though some foods may have such properties. Most of the time drugs are taken to treat a disease, or other medical condition. An example for such drugs may be Aspirin or Paracetamol. These are usually given to treat fever, as well as certain infections. If such drugs are taken over a longer time, they are usually prescribed by a doctor. Other drugs are taken for fun, because of the effect they have. Some of these drugs taken for fun are better accepted by society than others. Having or taking certain drugs may be illegal, in certain countries."
"Drugs that are taken to treat a disease or condition are usually called ""therapeutic"", drugs that are taken for fun are called ""recreational"" drugs."
Drugs may have other effects than those wanted. Such effects are generally known as side-effects.
"Drugs act differently in different amounts. It is therefore important to take the right amount. The amount of the drug taken is called a dose. Aspirin is often prescribed against fever, or as an analgesic. One of the side-effects of Aspirin is that it makes the blood thinner. For this reason, it can also be used to prevent strokes, or heart attacks - in a much lower dose than the one used to treat fever, though."
"Taking too much of a drug (""too high a dose"") can cause sickness or even death. When a doctor says how much of a drug (the right dose) to take, only that amount should be taken. It is very important to keep taking the drug until the doctor says to stop because someone can feel better but still be sick. When a doctor says what drug to take, how much of it, and for how long, it is called a prescription. Drugs may cause addiction. Some drugs are illegal because they are very addictive. These drugs are really expensive, too. It can also be sold illegally from drug sellers which may cause serious results"
Recreational drugs.
Recreational drugs can sometimes be bad for someone's health even if they make them feel good. Alcohol can also be dangerous if the person drinking it drives a vehicle after drinking. This is called drunk driving. Many countries make this against the law. Common recreational drugs include:
"Certain recreational drugs also have uses as a therapeutic drug. Heroin can be used as an analgesic (a painkiller) and methamphetamine is used to treat narcolepsy or ADHD. Recreational drugs can be dangerous, certain countries have made it illegal to have or take them outside a medical context. Most of the time, this is because they can be addictive or that they are very dangerous when combined with other drugs. That way, Cannabis-based products are legal in the Netherlands, but illegal in many other countries."
"Alcohol and Nicotine are legal almost everywhere, but there are a lot of taxes on the sale of these. In other words, they are expensive to buy. Being expensive to buy because of taxes has two benefits; one is that the taxes collected from the sale of the drugs goes into helping to pay for assistance the drug user may experience later. A smoker, for example, may develop cancer later in life and need treatment at a place that is granted a certain amount of tax money from the government to keep it operating. Another benefit to the taxing of ""legal"" drugs, is that the high price may stop people from beginning the habit in the first place, which will help them avoid the negative medical or addictive side effects of the drug. In some cases, not everyone is allowed to buy these drugs unless they are a minimal age to do so. The age at which someone is allowed to buy a legal drug is most often decided by the government of a country, state or province, and is usually the age where a person is considered by the law to be an ""adult"". Some of the most common ages this happens is at 18, 19 or 21 years of age."
Therapeutic drugs.
"Therapeutic drugs are also called ""medicinal drugs"", ""medicine"", or ""medication"". Doctors will give therapeutic drugs to someone who is ill to make you better. You can buy these drugs at a pharmacy. Some drugs need a prescription to be bought, other drugs do not. Drugs that do not require a prescription are called ""over the counter"" medications. There are lots of these drugs for different illnesses. These include:"
Bill Watterson
"William B. Watterson II (born July 5, 1958) is an American artist and cartoonist. He is most famous for his comic strip, ""Calvin and Hobbes"" which was published between 1985 and 1995. He is a very private person and not much is publicly known about him. He also did not want people to sell things with the pictures of his characters on them, and the only things he allowed to be made using his characters were books with collections of Calvin and Hobbes strips."
Centimetre
"A centimeter(the American spelling is centimeter, symbol cm) is a unit of length in the International System of Units (SI) measurement system. It is equal to one hundredth of a metre. Centi- is placed in front to say 'a hundredth'. The centimeter is the base unit of length in the old centimeter-gram-second (CGS) system of units."
The centimetre is usually used to measure things that are too big for millimetre but too small for metres. A centimetre is close to the length of a fingernail.
Similarities to other units of length.

History.
"Mohammad Sher Khan Babi, a Babi Khel Pathan who owed allegiance to the Mughal governor of Gujarat subah, founded the state of Junagadh. It declared independence in 1730 after the Marathas Gaikwad invasion. Muhammad Sher Khan Babi, was the founder of the Babi Dynasty of Junagadh State dynasty. His descendants, the Babi Nawabs of Junagadh, took large territories in southern Saurashtra and ruled over the state for the next two centuries. First they were a tributary state of Marathas. Later they were under the rule of the British Raj."
"In 1807 the Junagadh State became a British protectorate. The East India Company took control of the state by 1818. The Saurashtra area, with other princely states of Kathiawar, were separately administered under Kathiawar Agency by British India."
"On 15 August 1947 upon the independence of India, the Nawab of Junagarh decided to merge it into newly formed Pakistan. The Indian government maintained the people of Junagadh should decide. Pakistan waited until 13 September to respond saying they accepted Junagarh's acceptance of Pakistani rule. This caused a general revolt among the Hindu majority of Junagadh as well as protest movements in the surrounding states that had acceded to join India. The Nawab then occupied territory in several of those states claiming he had rule over them. When the Indian government sent a small force to restore order, the Nawab fled to Pakistan. His Dewan (Prime minister) agreed to rule by India. This resulted in the integration of Junagadh into India."
Rulers.
The Nawabs of Junagadh belonged to Pathan Babi khel tribe. They were granted a 13 gun salute by the British authorities:
Dispute.
Many in Pakistan still maintains the 1948 plebiscite and rule by India was an illegitimate action. One of the reasons is because Kashmir at the time was ruled by a Hindu but had a clear Muslim majority. By acceding to India it was the opposite of the situation in Junagadh.
"For its part India knew Junagadh was the premier state in the western Kathiawar region. It was bound on three sides by states that acceded to India. On the fourth side was bounded by the Arabian Sea. This gave it great strategic importance to both countries. India was not prepared to accept Junagadh's acceding to Pakistan. This would create a Pakistan state in the middle of Indian states. India's taking administrative control of Junagadh to restore order is seen as a pretext by Pakistan. The referendum taken by the people of Junagadh, under the control of the Indian army, was overwhelmingly in favor of Indian rule. Pakistan has never accepted this vote by the people there and believes Junagadh rightly belongs to them."
Pakistan's legitimacy claim.
"Pakistan's government has maintained its territorial claim on Junagadh, along with Manavadar and Sir Creek in Gujarat, on its official political map issued on 4th August 2020."
Nordertor
"The Nordertor (Danish: ""Nørreport"") is an old town gate of the city of Flensburg. The gate was built around 1595. Today, the little landmark is in use as a symbol for the German town Flensburg."
History.
"In 1345 the town of Flensburg began to build its town wall. A gate was built on the north side of the town. It was called ""Norder Porte"". It was replaced by a building in the 16th century called the Nordertor. This marked the northern boundary of the town. It was a checkpoint that was closed in the night."
"On the north side of the gate are two plaques. The left one shows the royal coat of arms of King Christian IV, 1577-1648 and the Latin words: „Regna Firmat Pietas“ — Piety strengthens the Realms. The right one shows the coat of arms of Flensburg with the German words: „Friede ernährt, Unfrieden verzehrt“ — Peace nurtures, strife devours. There is also a date- 1767. This means that the town gate was restored in the time of Christian VII, 1749-1808."
"After 1796 the town grew beyond the town wall. There had been a ban on building outside the wall before then. The Neustadt (""Newtown""), in the neighborhood of the Nordertor was built. In 1913 and 1914 it was restored by the architect Paul Ziegler. The Nordertor got a clock. In 1966 the Deutsche Bundespost made a stamp with a picture of the gate on it. It was a 30 Pfennig stamp, used to send letters within Germany. The Nordertor stamps were sold over 3 billion times. In the 1990s the gate was again restored and the clock was removed. In 2004 the gate was licensed as a venue for civil weddings, so that the weddings could be performed since then directly above the archway of the gate."
Ship's cat
"A ship's cat is a cat that rides along on a ship. Ship's cats have been very popular in history, and date back to ancient times."
"Cats have been carried on ships for many reasons - most importantly, to catch mice and rats. On a ship, these rodents can damage ropes and wooden parts of the ship. Once electricity was discovered, rodents would also damage ships' electrical wiring. Also, rodents threatened the ship's cargo - the things it carried. Rodents would eat the food carried to feed the crew. If the ship was carrying things like grain as part of its cargo, rodents could also cause the ship to lose money by eating the cargo. Also, rats and mice spread disease, which is dangerous for ships that are at sea for long periods of time. For example, rat fleas can carry plague, and rats on ships may have been one of the main reasons why the Black Death spread."
"Cats naturally attack and kill these rodents. Cats also have a natural ability to get used to new surroundings, so they could get used to serving on ships. They also offered companionship (friendship), a sense of home and security, and lifted sailors' spirits. This was helpful to sailors who could be away from home for long periods, especially in times of war."
Early history.
"Cats were probably domesticated about 9,500 years ago. Not long after that, people began taking cats aboard boats and ships. The Ancient Egyptians took cats on board Nile boats to catch birds in the thickets along the riverbanks. The ancient Egyptians also carried cats on trading ships to control rodents. Traders from other areas soon started doing the same thing. This led to the spread of cats throughout the world. Cats eventually reached nearly all parts of the world that could be reached by ship. Phoenician cargo ships are thought to have brought the first domesticated cats to Europe in about 900 BC."
Cats and superstition.
"Cats in Ancient Egypt were worshipped as deities (powerful spirits). For many centuries, cats have had a reputation as magical animals. Many sailors believed myths and superstitions about cats. Cats were thought of as smart, lucky animals. Sailors usually took very good care of their ship's cats to keep them happy. Some sailors believed that six-toed cats were better at catching pests. They may have thought that extra toes give a cat better balance, which would be important when at sea. In some places, all six-toed cats became known as ""ship's cats""."
"Cats were believed to have miraculous powers that could protect ships from dangerous weather. Sometimes, fishermen's wives would keep black cats at home too. They believed that these cats would use their special powers to protect their husbands at sea. Many sailors believed that it was lucky if a cat came up to a sailor on deck, but unlucky if it came only halfway and then turned around. Another popular belief was that cats could start storms through magic stored in their tails. Other sailors also believed that if a ship's cat fell or was thrown overboard, a terrible storm would come and sink the ship, and if the ship was able to survive, it would be cursed with nine years of bad luck. Still other sailors thought that if a cat licked its fur against the grain, it meant a hail storm was coming; if it sneezed, rain was coming; and if it was frisky, wind was coming."
"Some of these beliefs are partly true. Cats can notice slight changes in the weather, because of their very sensitive inner ears. (Their inner ears also allow cats to land on their feet when falling.) Cats often get nervous and restless when they sense low atmospheric pressure, which often comes before stormy weather."
Famous Ship's Cats.
Blackie.
"Blackie was HMS ""Prince of Wales""'s ship's cat. He became famous during the Second World War. Blackie's ship, ""Prince of Wales"", carried Prime Minister Winston Churchill across the Atlantic Ocean to Naval Station Argentia in Newfoundland in August 1941. There, Churchill secretly met with the United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and the two signed the Atlantic Charter. But as Churchill started to leave ""Prince of Wales"", Blackie came up to him. Churchill bent down to say goodbye to Blackie, and the moment was photographed and reported in the world media. In honour of the success of the visit, Blackie was renamed Churchill. Blackie survived the sinking of HMS ""Prince of Wales"" later that year and was taken to Singapore with the survivors. He could not be found when Singapore was evacuated the following year and nobody knows what happened to him (though there is a chance he may have died by then)."
"On the night of August 29, 1942, the camp's guards made bets about who could kill the most prisoners. One of the guards, Petar Brzica, reportedly cut the throats of about 1,360 of the new prisoners, using a butcher knife that became known as ""srbosjek"" (""Serb-cutter""). Other guards who admitted taking part in the bet included Ante Zrinušić, who killed about 600 inmates, and Mile Friganović, who gave a detailed and consistent report of what happened. Friganović admitted to killing 1,100 inmates. He specifically talked about how he tortured an old man named Vukasin. He ordered the man to bless the Ustaše leader, Ante Pavelić. The old man refused, even though Friganović cut off his ears, nose, and tongue every time he refused. Eventually, he cut out the old man's eyes, tore out his heart, and cut his throat. Dr. Nikola Nikolić saw this happen."
End of the camp.
"In April 1945, as Yugoslav Partisan units neared the camp, the Ustaše guards tried to get rid of evidence of their crimes and the people who knew what they had done. They tried to kill as many prisoners as possible, as fast as they could. On April 22, 600 prisoners revolted; 520 were killed and 80 escaped. Not long after the prisoners revolted, the Ustaše abandoned the camp. However, first, they killed the prisoners who were still alive. They also blew up and destroyed the buildings, guardhouses, torture rooms, crematoriums, and other parts of the camp. When they entered the camp, the Partisans found only ruins, soot, smoke, and dead bodies."
"By the end of 1945, the rest of Jasenovac was destroyed."
Victims.
Total number.
"Historians have had difficulty figuring out exactly how many people died at Jasenovac. Today, the most common estimate is that tens of thousands of people died at the camp. Before the 1990s, the most common estimate was that hundreds of thousands had died."
"These estimates are very different for many reasons. The Ustaše did not keep accurate records. Different people use different ways of estimating deaths. Sometimes, the people making estimates have political biases. In some cases, entire families were killed at the camp, leaving no one to submit their names to lists of the dead. On the other hand, the lists sometimes include the names of people who died in other places; people who survived; or people who are on more than one list."
Estimates by Holocaust organizations.
"The Yad Vashem center claims that over 500,000 Serbs were killed in the Independent State of Croatia. This includes Serbs who were killed at Jasenovac. The Simon Wiesenthal Center estimates the same."
"According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jasenovac's victims included ""between 45,000 and 52,000 Serb residents of the so-called Independent State of Croatia; between 12,000 and 20,000 Jews; between 15,000 and 20,000 Roma (Gypsies); and between 5,000 and 12,000 ethnic Croats and Muslims, who were political and religious opponents of the regime."""
Historical documents.
"There are many different documents from the time that Jasenovac existed, written by many different people. At the time, the Germans and Italians were fighting Yugoslav Partisans for control of Yugoslavia. People from both sides of that fight wrote about Jasenovac. The Ustaše themselves also wrote about the camp; so did the Vatican. Comparing all of these different accounts can help with estimates of how many people died at the camp."
"As the war went on, German generals wrote reports on the number of Serbs, Jews, and others killed in the Independent State of Croatia. In 1943, three different generals estimated that 300,000 to 400,000 Serbs had been killed. By March 1944, Ernst Fick wrote that 600,000 to 700,000 Serbs had been killed. Hermann Neubacher wrote:"
"""When prominent Ustashi [Ustaše] leaders claimed that they slaughtered a million Serbs (including babies, children, women and old men), that is, in my opinion, a boastful exaggeration. On the basis of the reports submitted to me, I believe that the number of defenseless victims slaughtered to be three quarters of a million. (Neubacher, Dr. Hermann. Special Assignment in the Southeast, p. 18-30.)"
"Italian generals reported similar figures to their commanders. The Vatican's sources also wrote of similar figures. For example, Eugen Tisserant reported that 350,000 Serbs had been killed by the end of 1942. Godfried Danneels estimated that a total of ""over 500,000 people"" were killed."
Steel is iron with a little carbon in it (0.3% to 1.7% carbon by weight).
"All metals get harder when a smith hammers or bends them. This is called ""work-hardening"". If a smith hammers or bends a piece of metal that is already work-hardened, it will crack and break. To make work-hardened metal soft again, so that a smith can hammer and bend it more, the smith anneals the metal."
"To ""anneal"" iron or steel, a blacksmith heats the metal until it no longer pulls a magnet, and then makes the metal become cold very slowly. Blacksmiths can cover the hot metal with sand, so that it takes hours to become cold. This makes iron or steel very soft."
"Steel acts just like iron, until a blacksmith ""heat-treats"" the steel. This is a special way to make the steel hot and then cold, so that the steel will become hard enough to keep a cutting edge (blade). A blade made from a piece of iron (instead of steel) will very soon become dull and will not cut. Good blades (for knives, chisels, axes, and other tools with cutting edges) are always made of steel, then heat-treated, and then sharpened."
"To heat-treat steel, a blacksmith heats the steel until it no longer pulls a magnet, then makes the steel become cold very quickly. A blacksmith does this by putting the hot steel into a bucket of water and moving it around until it is cold. This is called ""quenching"". When this is finished, the steel will be as hard as it can be. This hardness can make it brittle, so if someone hits or drops it, it can break like glass."
"The next step is to ""draw the temper"" or ""temper"" the steel, so that it will not break like glass. To temper steel, a blacksmith polishes a part of the steel so that it is smooth and shiny. The blacksmith then slowly heats the steel in the fire. When the steel is between , the polished steel will turn different colors. These colors do not glow in the dark; they look like dye on the polished steel. As the steel gets hotter from 300 to 650 degrees F, it will turn through the colors: yellow, then brown, then purple, then blue. Yellow means the steel will still be harder, blue means the steel will be softer (but still hard). When the steel turns the color that the blacksmith wants, he puts the steel into a bucket of water to stop the change. Different tools are tempered to different colors, but it also depends on how much carbon there is in the steel. Usually, stone chisels are tempered to yellow, and axes for trees are tempered to blue, but the blacksmith has to decide."
"A blacksmith does not hammer a blade edge thin. A blacksmith hammers the steel so that the edge stays thick. After the ""heat-treat"" and ""temper"", stones are used to grind the blade edge to make it sharp."
"If a blacksmith has a piece of iron or steel, but does not know which one it is, the blacksmith can heat-treat it like steel. If it does not become hard, then it is not steel. Iron will show the same temper colors as steel, but it will not be hard."
"If a blacksmith has an old steel tool, and wants to hammer it into a new different tool, the blacksmith anneals the steel. The steel will then be very soft like iron. The blacksmith can then hammer it into a new tool, and heat-treat and temper it, to make a new, hard steel tool."
"A blacksmith must be careful when hammering hardened steel or work-hardened iron, because small pieces can break off and fly, and these can hurt his or her eyes. Many blacksmiths wear plastic safety glasses to keep their eyes safe."
History.
The first blacksmiths were Hittites. They started working iron to make tools around 1500 BC. The ways that tools are made by blacksmiths have changed very little since then.
"Around 1850, countries like the United States of America and the United Kingdom made new ways to make steel and tools in factories. Factories now make tools faster, and for less money than blacksmiths. There are now very few blacksmiths in countries that have a lot of factories."
"The few blacksmiths that are still in countries with a lot of factories, make iron that is art. These blacksmiths make gates, stair rails, and chairs and tables for outdoors. People buy this iron as art, because each piece is different from the other pieces."

"1985–1989: NES/Famicom, ""Super Mario Bros."", and ""The Legend of Zelda""."
"Nintendo released its first home video game console, the Family Computer (released in North America as the Nintendo Entertainment System). While this happened, Miyamoto created two of the most famous games for the console and in the history of video games as a whole: ""Super Mario Bros."" (a sequel to ""Mario Bros."") and ""The Legend of Zelda"" (an entirely original title)."
"In both games, Miyamoto decided to focus more on gameplay than on high scores. This was different from most games at the time. ""Super Mario Bros."" was a linear game. The player moved the stage by running, jumping, and dodging or defeating enemies. Miyamoto used nonlinear gameplay in ""The Legend of Zelda"". This requires the player to think their way through riddles and puzzles. The world was big and it seemed to never end. It had a lot of different choices and depth never seen before in a video game. With ""The Legend of Zelda"", Miyamoto wanted to make an in-game world that players could relate to. He said it was like a ""small garden that they can put inside their drawer."" He was influenced from his time as a boy around Kyoto. When he was a boy, he explored nearby fields, woods, and caves; each ""Zelda"" title has this feeling of exploration. ""When I was a child,"" Miyamoto said, ""I went hiking and found a lake. It was quite a surprise for me to find it. When I traveled around the country without a map, trying to find my way, finding amazing things as I went, I realized how it felt to go on an adventure like this."" He recreated his memories of becoming lost in the maze of sliding doors in his family home in ""Zelda""s maze-like dungeons. In February 1986, Nintendo released the game as the first game for the Nintendo Entertainment System's new Disk System."
"Miyamoto worked on different games for the Nintendo Entertainment System. These games included ""Ice Climber"", ""Kid Icarus"", ""Excitebike"", and ""Devil World"". He also worked on sequels to ""Super Mario Bros"" and ""The Legend of Zelda""."
Super Mario Bros. 3 was developed by Nintendo Entertainment Analysis &amp; Development; the game took more than two years to make.
"1990–2000: SNES, Nintendo 64, ""Super Mario 64"", and ""Ocarina of Time""."
"A merger between Nintendo's different internal research and development teams led to the creation of Nintendo Entertainment Analysis &amp; Development (Nintendo EAD). Miyamoto was the head of it. Nintendo EAD had about fifteen months to develop ""F-Zero"", one of the launch titles for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Miyamoto worked on different games on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. One of them was ""Star Fox"". For the game, programmer Jez San convinced Nintendo to make an upgrade for the Super Nintendo. This upgrade would allow it to be able to show three-dimensional graphics better. This upgrade was the Super FX chip. Using this new hardware, Miyamoto and Katsuya Eguchi designed the ""Star Fox"" game with an early use of three-dimensional graphics."
"Miyamoto produced two big ""Mario"" titles for the system. The first game was ""Super Mario World"". It was a launch title. It was included with Super Nintendo Entertainment System consoles. It had an overworld as in ""Super Mario Bros."". It had a new character, Yoshi. Yoshi would go on to be in many other Nintendo games. The second ""Mario"" game for the system was ""Super Mario RPG"". It was different than most ""Mario"" games. Miyamoto led a team that was a partnership between Nintendo and Square Co.; it took almost a year to develop the graphics. The story takes place in a newly rendered Mushroom Kingdom based on the ""Super Mario Bros."" series."
"Shigeru Miyamoto helped Satoshi Tajiri. Miyamoto guided him during the creation of ""Pocket Monsters: Red and Green"" (released in English as ""Pokémon Red"" and ""Blue""), the first video games in the Pokémon series. He was also the producer for these games. Miyamoto worked on social gameplay ideas such as trading. Pokémon would become one of the most popular entertainment franchises in the world, spanning video games, anime, and other merchandise."
"Miyamoto made several games for the Nintendo 64. Most of these games were from his previous franchises. His first game on the Nintendo 64 was ""Super Mario 64"". He was the main director. In developing the game, he started with character design and the camera system. Miyamoto and the other designers were unsure of what the game should be like. It took months to decide on a good camera view and layout. The first idea used a fixed path. This would have been similar to an isometric-type game.They decided on a free-roaming 3D design. He changed the design of the Nintendo 64 controller to fit with that of ""Super Mario 64""."
"Using what he had learned about the Nintendo 64 from developing ""Super Mario 64"" and ""Star Fox 64"", Miyamoto produced his next game, '. He led a team of several directors. Individual parts of ""Ocarina of Time"" were developed by multiple directors—a new strategy for Nintendo EAD. However, when things progressed slower than expected, Miyamoto returned to the development team with a more central role. He was helped in public by interpreter Bill Trinen. The team was new to 3D games. However, assistant director Makoto Miyanaga remembers a feeling of ""passion for creating something new and never done before"". Miyamoto went on to produce a sequel to ""Ocarina of Time"", known as '."
"Miyamoto worked many ""Mario"" series spin-offs for the Nintendo 64. These included ""Mario Kart 64"" and ""Mario Party""."
"2000–2011: GameCube, Wii, and DS."
"Miyamoto produced many games for the GameCube. This included the launch title ""Luigi's Mansion"". The game was first shown at Nintendo Space World 2000 as a technical demo. It was designed to show off the graphical power of the GameCube. Miyamoto made a short demo of the game concepts. Nintendo decided to make it a full game. ""Luigi's Mansion"" was later shown at E3 2001 with the GameCube console. Miyamoto made more ""Mario"" spinoffs in these years. He also produced the 3D game series ""Metroid Prime"". This was because the original designer Yokoi, a friend of Miyamoto's, died. In this time he developed ""Pikmin"" and its sequel ""Pikmin 2"". These games were based on his experiences gardening. He also worked on new games for the ""Star Fox"", ""Donkey Kong"", ""F-Zero"", and ""The Legend of Zelda"" series on the GameCube and the Game Boy Advance systems. With the help of Hideo Kojima, he helped the developers of """". He helped with many games on the Nintendo DS. The games included the remake of ""Super Mario 64"", ""Super Mario 64 DS"". It also included the new game ""Nintendogs"", a new franchise based on his own experiences with dogs."
"2011–present: Wii U, 3DS, and Switch."
"Miyamoto produced ""Super Mario 3D Land"" and """" for the 3DS, and ""Pikmin 3"" for the Wii U."
"After Nintendo president Satoru Iwata died in July 2015, Miyamoto was chosen to be an acting Representative Director, along with Genyo Takeda. He was no longer in this position in September 2015 when Tatsumi Kimishima became the company's president. He was also chosen to be in the position of ""Creative Fellow"" at the same time. He would give expert advice to Kimishima as a ""support network"" alongside Takeda."
"Miyamoto was a creative director on the 2017 game ""Super Mario Odyssey"". He was not one of its producers. He is credited as being a big influence on the game's development."
Development philosophy.
"Miyamoto and Nintendo do not use focus groups. Instead, Miyamoto figures out if a game is fun by playing it himself. He says that if he enjoys it, others will too. He uses how the ""Pokémon"" series was created as an example. He said ""And that's the point – Not to make something sell, something very popular, but to love something, and make something that we creators can love. It's the most important feeling we should have when we make games."""
Impact.
"""Time"" called Miyamoto ""the Spielberg of video games"" and ""the father of modern video games."" ""The Daily Telegraph"" says he is ""regarded by many as possibly the most important game designer of all time."" ""GameTrailers"" called him ""the most influential game creator in history."" Miyamoto has greatly influenced various things about video games in general. ""The Daily Telegraph"" credited him with creating ""some of the most innovative, ground breaking and successful work in his field."" Many of Miyamoto's works have started new video game concepts or changed existing ones. Miyamoto's games have received outstanding critical praise. Some are considered to be the best games of all time."
"Miyamoto's games have also sold very well. Some became the best-selling games on Nintendo consoles and of all time. As of 1999, his games had sold 250 million copies and grossed billions of dollars."

"Choti Bahu 2 () is the second season of an Indian television drama series. The series premiered on February 15, 2011. It currently airs every Mon-Fri 7:30 pm on Zee TV channel. It is about the lives of Radhika and Dev. It is a different story than the first season. It has a different storyline and even some characters except for Dev and Radhika which are played by Avinash Sachdev and Rubina Dilaik respectively. The show is very popular and gains good TRP with an average of 2–3."
Plot.
"Radhika, a Brahmin by birth, was adopted and brought up by a family of weavers in a small town. Dev visited the town with his family, met Radhika and became good friends. One day, while Radhika and Dev playing in a temple, they reached a place where 50 couples were getting married. Dev rubbed sindoor on Radhika's forehead, which she had gotten on her head by accident. This caused them to get married without their knowledge. When a priest who witnessed Dev and Radhika's ""wedding"" comes to Radhika's home and tells her parents that Radhika is married, Radhika tries to tell Dev this but is unable to meet him again."
After 12 years.
"One night after college, Radhika meets Dev. They spend time together but Radhika feels bad that she is attracted to someone else. Later on, she finds out that Dev is the one she had married as a child and tells him the truth. Under obligations, he tells her to marry Rohan. She tries to make him accept many times, but he refuses."
"Radhika is unable to get married to Rohan after all. A fire starts and Rohan gets badly burned, though Radhika is saved. Dev meets Radhika in the hospital and asks her what caused the fire. She tells him that Rohan knows that she loves someone else; Dev gets angry at this and tells her he hates her. Radhika decides to get into their house as the ""choti bahu"" and wife of Dev without telling anyone so she can gain Dev's trust back."
"After all the misunderstandings are cleared, the family accepts Dev and Radhika's relationship and Dev and Radhika are soon to be wed. However, because of social norms, everyone calls Radhikha an unchaste woman. To end this problem, Dadaji calls off Dev's marriage with Radikha and fixes it with Barkha. On the eve of Barkha and Dev's wedding, Barkha, wishing to help Radhika, lies to Radikha that she has told Dadaji about what happened 12 years ago and Dadaji has accepted her and will let her become Dev's wife. Radhika therefore dresses up in Barkha's wedding dress and takes the wedding vows with Dev."
"After Dadaji realizes that Dev married Radikha instead of Barkha, he suffers a fatal heart attack. The Purohit family decides that Dev will pretend to be married to Barkha in the public eye, and Radhika will perform all of the normal tasks at home."
"Radhika obediently performs all the duties of a ""choti bahu"". Barkha puts sleeping powder in Dev's juice, causing him to become unconscious. Barkha then reveals that she loves Dev and Radhika overhears everything. Barkha realizes this and decides to kill Radhika to get Dev's love. Barkha murders Radhika by driving into her with a car twice. In a twist, Radhika returns after a month, but this time is different — she has become confident and fearless. This is because Kanha, the god Radhika is devoted to, has disguised himself as Radhika to put an end to Barkha's crimes, as Dev is made only for Radhika."
"The rest of the story tells how Kanha teaches Barkha her lesson. One day, when Kanha is at home as Radhika, Dev asks her if she's alright. Radhikha asks why, and Dev tells her he saw her outside the temple begging for help. This is actually the real Radhika, who was reborn after Barkha tried to suffocate her. Dev is later poisoned by a juice that Barkha got originally for Radhika, and the family believes Radhika did it. Barkha repeatedly tries to get Radhika out of the house."
"Then the real Radhika comes in the house. However, Kahna helps Radhika throughout everything. Barkha tries to murder Radhika again, but Dev stops her. The entire family then appears and disgraces Barkha, finally knowing her true nature. However, as Radhika faints, Barkha flees and successfully escapes. Later in the day, while Radhika and Dev go into the forest, Barkha tries to kill both of them, thinking that if she can't have Dev, no one can. However, everyone thinks she dies instead. The monastery was being taken by the bharawaj family which was however Radhikas real family. Ruby wants to kill Radhika even though she is her twin sister and that is the reason why she wants to kill her. Radhika and Dev both go to mumbai to radhika's house but Dev feels uncomfortable when they get a unwelcoming welcome from Ruby.

1858 expedition.
"Stuart learned from his trip with Sturt that large groups were not able to move quickly through the dry Australian lands. He believed that a small group would have more success. Finke paid him to find out if the land north of Lake Torrens would be suitable for sheep. On this first trip he went with two men, Forster and an unnamed Aboriginal youth. They took six horses, enough food for six weeks, a watch and a compass. In May 1858 they went through settled areas until they reached Oratunga Station, one of the most remote farms in South Australia. It is near the present day town of Blinman, in the north of the Flinders Ranges. From here they went northwest and found a permanent water hole, Andamooka Waterhole, on a creek Stuart named Chambers Creek. It has since been renamed Stuart Creek. The country was very dry, and they could only find water in Aboriginal wells. The stony ground hurt the horses feet. At the end of July they reached the site of the present day town of Coober Pedy. Their horses were in poor condition and they were running out of food. Stuart decided to change direction to the south west and try and reach the coast near Fowlers Bay. The Aboriginal youth would not go any further and went back. He was scared of other Aborigines in the area they were going into. Stuart said the land was ""...dreary, dismal, dreadful desert."" Stuart and Forster reached the coast at Denial Bay in August 1858, and were back in settled farm lands by 11 September. They had completed a journey of in four months. He gave his diary and maps to the South Australian government. As a reward, Stuart was given the lease to 1,000 square miles of land at Chambers Creek."
Stuart's second expedition 1859.
"The official South Australian government explorer Benjamin Herschel Babbage followed Stuart's maps and went to Chambers Creek. He reported that the map showed the creek was marked too far to the north. Stuart went back to Chambers Creek to survey the area again. This expedition was paid for by James Chambers and William Finke who realized the value of reliable water supplies on the other side of the salt lakes. Stuart left Oratunga Station on 2 April 1859, with a small group, three men and 14 horses. The men he took with him included a Bavarian naturalist and artist, David Herrgott, and Louis Müller, a stockman and botanist. Both Herrgott and Müller had been gold miners in Victoria, and would know how to look for gold in the country around Chambers Creek. They did not carry much equipment, only a blanket to sleep with, but no tents. The only food they took was flour, dried beef (jerky), tea, sugar and tobacco. He took more equipment than just his watch and compass on this trip; a sextant, a copy of the Astronomical Almanac and a telescope."
"Stuart went a different way to Chambers Creek, going through a gap in between the salt lakes that had been explored by Major Peter Warburton earlier in the year. Herrgott found a group of 12 artesian springs, which Stuart named after him. This name later became the settlement of Herggott Springs. The name was changed again during World War One because of strong anti-German feelings in Australia. The town is now called Marree after the Aboriginal word for possum. These springs were mound springs; over thousands of years the salt in the water had formed small hills, and the water came out of them like water out of a volcano. Some of the mounds were over high. They were valuable because they provided reliable water for people and animals moving north to Chambers Creek."
"After surveying Chambers Creek again, Stuart explored the area to the north west of Chambers Creek. They found more mound springs which Stuart named Elizabeth Springs after one of Chamber's daughters. They continued north west and searched for gold in the Davenport Range. They found more springs which they named the Spring of Hope. They were able to continue and found more springs, which Stuart named Freeling Springs, after Major Freeling, a South Australian politician. By the time they had passed the current site of Oodnadatta, both the men and the horses were suffering from the lack of water and proper food. The horses' shoes had worn out in the rocks around the Davenport Range. On 12 June 1859, Stuart turned around and went back. They rode south back to Port Augusta and then took a boat back to Adelaide."
Third expedition 1859.
"The South Australian government offered a prize of £2,000 to the first person to cross Australia from the south to the north. They hoped this would be a route for the Australian Overland Telegraph Line that would connect Australia to the line that came from Europe. Stuart and Chambers plans for the trip were not accepted by the government. The government sent Alexander Tolmer to lead the trip. His expedition did not make it out of the settled areas. In August 1859, one month after his last trip, Stuart went back to do more surveying for Chambers at Chambers Creek. With William Darton Kekwick and two other men, they took 12 horses and explored the west side of Lake Eyre. Chambers and Stuart believed that the lake might hold water. Instead Stuart found mud after he walked several kilometres into the dry salt lake. He found another artesian mound spring, more than in height, which he named William Springs, after one of Chamber's sons. He then set off for the Spring of Hope. He saw grasslands and eventually made a base at Freeling Springs. He explored much of the surrounding area hoping to find gold. On 6 January 1860, with his food supplies getting low, and two of the men refusing to go any further, Stuart once again returned home."
Fourth expedition September 1860.
"There was a lot of support for an expedition to cross Australia. In Melbourne, the biggest exploring expedition in Australian history, the Victorian Exploring Expedition, was being organized for the crossing. This became known as the Burke and Wills expedition, named after its two leaders, Robert O'Hara Burke and William John Wills. Stuart knew that he would be able to travel further and faster by only going with a small group. In March 1860, with Kekwick, Benjamin Head and 13 horses, Stuart left Chambers Creek and headed north. They were the first Europeans to enter central Australia. They reached the Finke River, the MacDonnell Ranges, and the strange rock formation Stuart called Chambers Pillar. On 23 April, Stuart worked out that they were at the very centre of Australia. He named a small hill near the spot Mount Sturt, after Charles Sturt. Stuart and Kekwick climbed the hill and raised the British flag. Stuart wrote that the flag would be a sign to the Aborigines ""...that the dawn of liberty, civilization, and Christianity is about to break upon them."" The name was later changed to Central Mount Stuart. From here Stuart tried to go northwest to reach the Victoria River. This took them into the Tanami Desert, but they could not find water and were forced to go back."
"They continued to travel north, beyond the site of the town of Tennant Creek. On 26 June they reached a creek, now called Attack Creek, about north of Adelaide. A large group of Aborigines from a group called the Warramunga, attacked the explorers. The Warrumunga threw boomerangs at the explorers, and then set fire to the grass. Stuart and his men fired their guns at the Warrumunga, but Stuart does not say in his diary if any were killed or injured. The men quickly left the creek and went south."
"Stuart decided they could not get any further north because they were running out of food, water was scarce and the horses were in poor condition. He wrote ""...I think it would be madness and folly to attempt more."" The return journey was very difficult. Stuart could only ride for a few hours a day; on one day he just dug a hole in the sand and curled up in it. Head was so hungry he stole food, which left them with even less. Their clothes were only torn rags and their bodies were covered in bruises caused by scurvy. Stuart wrote in his diary that ""My men have now lost all their former energy...and move about as if they were a hundred years old. It is sad to see them..."" Stuart wrote in his diary that sores on his hands had made them to painful to be used and he could only just sit in the saddle. He gums had become so sore and his teeth so loose that he could only eat flour boiled in water. He wrote on 16 May that ""...I almost wished that death would come and relieve me from my fearful torture..."" The medicines he had with him did not help."
The explorers made their way back to Adelaide as Burke and Wills were starting their journey north from Melbourne. Stuart was treated as a hero when he arrived in Adelaide. In 1859 the Royal Geographical Society in London presented him with gold watch. This was given to the explorer Count Paul Strzelecki to take back to Australia.
"The cost of Stuart's exploring had been paid for by Chambers. Because of this, Stuart would not make his journals and maps available to the public. This led to claims that Stuart had not really travelled that far north and that he was lying about his discoveries. In Victoria it was even said that Stuart had not really gone north, but had been hiding in a cellar in Adelaide."
Fifth expedition 1861.
"The public and the newspapers began to talk about a race across the continent of Australia. Could Stuart, experienced and used to moving quickly, beat the better equipped, but very slow moving Burke and Wills expedition. After their failures with Babbage and Tolmer's expeditions, the South Australian government now believed that Stuart would succeed if he had enough support. They gave £2,500 to set up another expedition and provided ten armed men to protect Stuart from any more attacks by the Aborigines. Chambers agreed to supply more horses and to pay Stuart and Kekwick's wages. In Victoria, a policeman was sent off to tell Burke to get going to the Gulf of Carpentaria as fast as possible, but Burke had already heard about Stuart's planned trip. Burke divided his group in two, and leaving most of his supplies behind at Menindee on the Darling River, he headed north to Cooper Creek."
"On 1 January 1861, Stuart with a group of 12 men and 49 horses set off from Chambers Creek. The hot weather made it hard to find water and many waterholes from his earlier trips were dry. In February Stuart sent back two men with five horses. They reached the northern border of South Australia at about the same time that Burke and Wills reached the Gulf of Carpentaria. He was able to travel 240 km north of Attack Creek, where he found a large waterhole he called Glandfield Lagoon, after the mayor of Adelaide. Chambers later changed the name on Stuart's maps to Newcastle Waters, after the Duke of Newcastle, a British politician. From here Stuart again looked for a way to go north west to the Victoria River, but he was unable to find water. With the food running out, the men becoming sick, and horses in poor condition, Stuart again decided to return to Adelaide. Burke and Wills had not returned to Cooper Creek and were missing."
Stuart was presented with the Royal Geographical Society's Patron's Medal for 1861.
Sixth expedition 1861–62.
"Stuart set out on his third attempt to cross Australia on 25 October 1861. This expedition was called the Great Northern Exploring Expedition. The group was: John McDouall Stuart, William Darton Kekwick, Francis William Thring, William Patrick Auld, Stephen King Jnr., John William Billiatt, James Frew Jnr., Heath Nash, John Woodforde, John McGorrery and Frederick George Waterhouse."
"McGorrey was a blacksmith who would be able to fix the shoes on the group's 78 horses. Waterhouse was a naturalist who would be able to keep a scientific notes of their discoveries. Stuart was injured when a horse stood on his right hand, and remained behind for a month to recover. He learned about the deaths of Burke and Wills at Cooper Creek."
"The group left Chambers Creek on 8 January 1862 moving fast, covering between 30 and 50 kilometres a day. The fast pace meant that in the first three weeks eight horses died and Woodforde left and went back. Stuart left some of the supplies behind and cut the amount each man was allowed to eat. At Mount Hay in central Australia, they were again attacked by Aboriginal warriors, but they were no match for the group's guns and several may have been killed."
"They reached Newcastle Waters in three months, and then took a week to rest. Stuart spent the next five weeks searching for water. He finally found a series of waterholes, creeks and rivers which meant the whole group were able to continue to the north. He gave up trying to reach the Victoria River. When they got to the Roper River, which had been explored by Ludwig Leichhardt in 1845, he knew he could easily go west to the Gulf of Carpentaria, but instead chose to continue north. Auld later said that ""...the mosquitos and flies were terrible. Our hands, feet and necks were blistered with their bites."" They crossed Arnhem Land, and made the way along the edge of what is now Kakadu National Park. He followed the Adelaide River, but when the ground became too soft and muddy, they went further north to the Mary River and eventually reached the sea."
"They arrived at Van Diemen's Gulf on 24 July 1862. On a tall tree branch they raised a Union Jack flag with Stuart's name embroided on it which had been made by Chamber's daughter, Elizabeth. Wood from the tree, which has since been destroyed, is in the collection of the Royal Geographical Society of South Australia's collection. The group then had to travel back to Adelaide. Food was becoming scarce, and the hot weather meant there was little water. Many horses died, and Stuart was again forced to leave behind equipment. Waterhouse had to leave all his carefully collected plants and animals. The men were very hungry and even shot and ate dingos. Stuart was in poor health and became blind. He was unable to speak for several days and the men thought he was going to die. He was unable to ride his horse, and they made a bed with long poles and blankets that could be carried between two horses. Stuart was carried by this method. after crossing the MacDonnell Ranges, they discovered that rain had fallen and there was lots of grass. On reaching the settled areas, Stuart learned that his friend and partner, James Chambers had died. He left Kekwick in charge of the group, and went ahead with Auld. They got on the train at Kapunda and arrived in Adelaide on 17 December 1862."
Stuart and his group were given a special welcome in Adelaide on 16 January 1863. They dressed in their old clothes and rode into the city as heroes. This was also the day that Burke and Wills were buried in Melbourne after the failure of their expedition.
Later life.
"Stuart was in poor health, almost blind, and had a crippled right hand after the sixth trip. With Chambers dead, he no longer had a job. The government tried not to pay him the £2,000 reward, saying that they had paid for the cost of the expedition. After public pressure, they gave in, but invested the money and only gave Stuart a small amount each year. He was drinking a lot of alcohol and none of his friends would give him any help. The government then wanted £500 for the lease of the land they had given him at Chambers Creek. Stuart sold it to James Chambers' brother, John Chambers, for only £200, losing money on the deal."
"He decided to return to Great Britain in April 1864. He lived with his sister Mary in Glasgow, Scotland. The Royal Geographical Society asked the South Australian government for a pension for Stuart, but they said he had been rewarded enough with grants of land. During the debate over the pension it was said that it was not the exploring that had ruined his health, but his drinking habits. He suffered from dementia, and it is possible he also had tuberculosis. He died in London on 5 June 1866 from a stroke and was buried in the Kensal Green Cemetery. Only seven people went to the funeral, four relatives, two members of the Royal Geographical Society, and Alexander Hay, a South Australian farmer who was in London at the time. The grave was damaged in World War II, but was repaired in 2011 by the Stuart Society and the Royal Geographical Society of South Australia."
"The Australian Overland Telegraph Line was built along the route taken by Stuart. Using his notes they were easily able to find water supplies and trees to make the poles. The accuracy of his maps made building the line much easier. His journey is remembered in the Stuart Highway, one of Australia's major roads which joins Port Augusta to Darwin. It follows much of the same route discovered by Stuart. In June 1904, a statue of Stuart was put up in Adelaide. The Royal Geographical Society of South Australia has a wooden chair and table made by Stuart in 1854."
"Benjamin Head later said about Stuart ""...that he was a born leader of men: the sharpest little fellow you would find in a year's march."""
Conclusion.
"Stuart and A.C. Gregory were arguably Australia’s greatest inland explorers. The latter was certainly financed and equipped much better than Stuart who had to rely on Chambers and Finke’s support rather than the State Government. It may very well have been possible for Stuart to reach the north coast earlier if he had the Government support that Gregory, Babbage and Tolmer were granted. That said, he didn’t and was totally driven to reach the north coast despite illness and afflictions that arguably he had since arriving in South Australia and were to see him die at such an early age in England in 1866. The key attributes that made Stuart one, if not the best inland explorer, include:"
"Yeah,"
"But they like that with the, the cool ranch dressing that goes along with that."
"Oh yeah,"
"yeah,"
we like that.
Yeah.
"That's good that, that's a good way to get kids to eat vegetables too."
Yeah.
"My son's getting to be a, a real good cook"
"so, uh,"
"Oh, neat."
sometimes he fixes me breakfast
"Oh, wow, that's great"
"Yeah,"
"I like it,"
I like it a lot.
How old is he?
He's eleven.
"Eleven,"
"wow, that's good."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
so
Do you cook like you cook a breakfast every morning
"or,"
"Uh, not every morning, uh,"
mostly during the summer it's hit and miss
"and, we usually have like, uh, cold cereal or something like that."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Um, during the during wintertime when they're in school, um, then I try to vary it so that we only eat that like a twice a, twice a week or something and then have like, when it's really cold, I even cook oatmeal, Because I like oatmeal"
Uh-huh.
That's what my mother said one time.
"You know, right,"
because who says that they just must got to come over to see us all the time for the holidays.
Right.
"No,"
"that's true,"
"and if they force them to, you know that's not good either."
Yeah.
That becomes a drudgery
"Well, do they all live in the area?"
"got, of the six, we've got four around here."
"Uh-huh,"
"oh, wow."
"Uh, you know, well, we're talking like north Texas."
Uh-huh.
"And then, one is in Vermont, uh, Montpelier Montpelier, Vermont"
Golly.
"and the other one is in Everett, Washington."
How did they end up so far away?
"Well, that is, that's, the, the, my little pair. And my second marriage."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, and, uh,"
Those are the youngest ones?
"Yeah,"
"well, the"
"the, the, the, the fourth and fifth child of the of the, of the, uh, six are the two that are scattered like that."
Uh-huh.
"Boy, that's, those are a long way."
"And, Well, they wanted to go, uh,"
"How,"
"J R, my, my, my last son or my middle son, excuse me, fell in love with Washington state"
Uh-huh.
"Okay,"
Gene
"So, it's nice to talk with you"
"and, um, food is a very intriguing thing."
"Our lives are, are built around foods that we like and, nutritionally good for us."
"Yes, sir."
What kind of dining out do you like?
"Well, there is two kinds."
"One I guess I'd say is with my wife where we enjoy, uh oh, I guess we usually enjoy a good seafood restaurant."
Oh.
"Uh, you know, something nice."
Yeah.
"And the other is with my whole family whom we, uh, go somewhere that the kids will enjoy"
"Uh, recently we have been hitting Pancho's up."
It's a local Mexican restaurant.
Uh-huh.
"because they have got a good rate on, you know, good prices and everything."
"Pancho's, that's,  a new one."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
Uh-huh.
"it's, it's a chain down uh,"
it goes up into Colorado and down here.
I don't know where else it is.
What about you?
We have one called Chi Chi's in in our area.
"Oh, yeah."
"And, uh, we had a restaurant called La Bamba"
"but it's just, it closed recently."
"But Chi Chi's is a national restaurant, I think."
Isn't it Mexican?
"I think,  think it might be."
right.
"But, uh, at, uh, Christmas time we just have a regular sit down dinner, you know. Which is kind of hard because you got so many people"
Uh-huh.
"and then by time you pass everything around,"
it seems like everything on your plate's cold.
I know.
I know
"So,"
"Well,"
"But anyhow, I,"
"Thank God for microwaves, you know."
"Yeah,"
"you can, always take your plate and just heat it up, you know."
Yeah.
"But, uh, other than that, I, I don't have too many parties."
"Uh, you know, I have, like, maybe just a another couple over for dinner."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, other than, than, than that I don't have, you know a whole bunch of people like except, except at Christmas"
Yeah.
and I have my family.
"Right,"
well I don't anymore.
it's been a few years
"and, and, uh, I don't have, you know, over a couple either"
"and and, uh, I try to, uh, have everything all ready"
Uh-huh.
"and, and it, it just makes it a lot nicer where a don't spend all my time in the kitchen."
"Yeah,"
right.
"And, uh, Spaghetti"
Right.
And that was hard too.
"I, I lucked out with really good people both times"
but I know so many people that are never able to find that
"and I'd practically give my paycheck away to do it,"
so
Yeah.
Yeah.
Did you have a nanny
or did you have someone  that lived in with you?
Yeah.
"Well no,"
she didn't live with us.
"Uh, the first one was an, elderly lady who was putting a, a daughter through nursing school  just purely on baby-sitting money."
Oh.
Oh my goodness.
And she kept Cheryl during the day and then did more baby-sitting at night.
Uh-huh.
And she was neat because she was like the grandmother that my kids never had  because both our parents are dead.
Yeah.
Oh.
"So that, that was a plus from  that respect as well."
Oh gosh.
And then with Emily it was a neighborhood friend that kept her.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"So,"
"I have, uh,"
I just cannot fathom putting a little bitty baby in a commercial care center.
Uh-huh.
"I was just listening to a program this morning,"
"oh well, I guess it was on the HOME SHOW,"
"but they were talking about, uh, a new, uh,"
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
and I guess you are.
Uh-huh.
That we dress in the jeans
"and then there's kind of the, the branch manager level or marketing people that kind of do that middle thing."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"But there's not much,"
middle of the road.
It's nice that there's not a requirement for it.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
Sometimes I think there should be.
Some of these women around here look like they came off of Harry Hines.
"Oh, yeah,"
right
"Yeah,"
I guess you see those once in a while.
"And you know the, they have the no shorts deal,"
"and some of these mini skirts, you know, are worse than shorts ever thought about being."
Sure.
"But, uh, You know, that's, I guess that's one of the things you got to put up with when you don't have a dress code."
Yeah.
"That's right,"
that's right.
"I guess they're, the, isn't there a dress code, something about spaghetti straps,"
I'm not even sure what they are.
Supposedly and backless things
"Oh, backless,"
all right.
"I just, I don't I think that I perhaps would let them have the boat or something,"
I'd make some quick arrangements
That's true.
and I've told so many stories about the snakes
Uh-huh.
"you know, when they pull in, there's a snake instead of a fish, and things like that"
Yeah.
"I'm just,"
Oh.
"I don't know,"
Yeah.
What's the largest fish you ever caught?
"Uh, gosh,"
"I think it was only like three and a half pounds,"
and for me that's big.
"That's why I'm saying I love to go fishing because I've never caught anything really, really big."
"Uh, so, because it's always been, you know, in the, on a lake, and, uh,"
I know they have bigger fish than that
"but, you know, three and a half pounds, and that was, huge for me,"
"Oh, on a lake,"
yeah.
"On a like that's not a bad size fish. *listen; transcript should probably read ""lake"" not ""like"""
"yeah,"
that's a good size fish
I would be impressed
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"So, uh, but"
"yeah,"
I'd love to go catch like the Marlins or whatever in the deep sea fishing.
I've never done that.
Uh-huh.
I find it to be a good out
and I still enjoy the marching band
"and I still enjoy, uh, singing in the choir"
"so,"
Do you sing at choir at your church?
"Yes,"
I do.
Yeah.
"Yes,"
I do.
"That's,"
"in fact, that's about the only musical thing that I still do is sing in the choir."
Yeah.
"I tried out for choir when I was, think, in the seventh grade"
and they wouldn't let me in.
"So, I never tried again."
"Well, I sing in the choir,"
"I do know if they want me to or not,"
but at least I do sing in it
"Yeah,"
That's pretty good.
"Well,"
I never really learned the music or anything.
"I never learned,"
I got right to where I was figuring out where all the keys were on the piano
and that's about when I quit.
"I was at,"
"I actually went to the University of Texas at one time thinking that I would, be a musician."
I wanted to be a high school band director.
Yeah.
"But after one semester of that, I said no, no,"
this isn't for me.
"it's,"
the lines in there were just perfect.
"I mean, it was classic TREK."
"Now, does the old STAR TREK guys meet the new guys?"
"No,"
huh-uh.
"No,"
it's just the old guys still.
"Yeah,"
it was just a rumor that that would happen this time.
"However, the rumor is, is that it will happen next, happen next time"
"so,"
"You know, that I read in PEOPLE or somewhere, no, it was U S A TODAY"
Uh-huh.
that they said they weren't going to do anymore.
That was it.
Uh-huh.
"But,"
"Yeah,"
"uh, except that the rumor is, is that they still might,"
but it may not include the entire crew
and it will be a next generation meets this generation
Huh.
"So,"
"I'm not sure what the difference in light years between the new generation and the, the old guys was."
I think it's a hundred years.
Huh.
Somewhere in that range.
"Considering that Spock was on an, uh, you know, couple weeks ago and that the, the very first episode of NEXT GENERATION, they had McCoy."
"Oh, that's right."
Is that right?
He was a doctor still?
so I'm in the process of telling my wife we got to go shopping for clothes again.
"<Laughter> That's neat,"
that's neat
"And, uh, I, I don't know,"
"now I, I know eastern,"
"now the other thing we do here, of course, is a single, not quite a single climate."
"We have, uh, we do have some snow in the wintertime"
and it can be quite warm in the summertime.
Uh-huh.
"Not hot like, uh,"
I lived in the midwest for a while.
Oh.
"And I know that, uh, you know, it can be freezing cold in the wintertime, and hot and, uh, sticky in the summertime."
Uh-huh.
We don't have that much.
"It's, uh, it's a very mild climate."
"Oh, well that's nice."
"That's good for the clothes budget, I would imagine."
"Yes,"
it is.
"Because here, gosh, we had, uh,"
the winter hasn't been bad this winter.
"It's, it it's only snowed maybe once or twice"
but it's been cold.
"Low twenties, let's say,"
"and then the summer gets up to eighties, nineties"
"so,"
You interested in woodworking?
Yeah.
"Actually, I, uh, I guess I am"
"Um, it just seems kind of funny that this is a topic of discussion."
"Uh, I do, uh, some, uh, woodworking myself"
Right.
"And I would much rather own my own home than, than be renting it like we're doing."
"I mean, we're basically, you know, kind of throwing seven hundred dollars a month away."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
We're renting a house.
Uh-huh.
"But, you know, right now with the way our credit card situation is, there's nobody in the world that's going to give us a mortgage on a house."
"Right,"
right.
"But, but, once I suppose you, you prove yourself by paying this off next year you'll be in very good shape."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"It's, it's going to, it's going to take quite a while."
Uh-huh.
Hopefully within five years we'll be in our own home.
Uh-huh.
"But, um, I'm not really counting on it real soon."
Okay
You want to get a start?
Certainly.
"Uh, the weather here is warm."
Uh-huh.
And it has been sort of raining on and off.
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, I am an avid gardener"
"so I measure the rain in our rain gauge on a, on a regular basis."
"So I can, can avoid wasting money on watering."
"Oh, great,"
great.
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, but it has been threatening to rain for the last couple of days,"
I was thinking that's the only thing I could really think of that would really be.
My mom doesn't even like for us to go through her cabinets.
Really.
"I mean, we're all grown,"
"all her kids are grown,"
and we have our own families
Uh-huh.
"and now if we go through her cabinets she's like, Well, what are you digging for?"
"Yeah,"
get out of my cabinets.
"Like, what are you doing?"
Don't you have your own house to dig through?
That's great.
"Yeah,"
"so, I guess, privacy is really,"
"and at the work place, I suppose,"
"oh, well, actually yes."
"I can say definitely, privacy at the work place."
Uh-huh.
I hate it for people to open up my drawer to my desk
See.
Yeah.
"because that was, that was where I kept all my stuff,"
"and I could tell I mean, even if a pen was turned the wrong way."
"You could tell,"
"you know you put your stuff where it's,"
Yeah.
"That would drive, that would, that"
"It would drive, it drove me batty for a while."
Really.
"Yeah,"
"well, I worked a second shift"
"Huh. So you have a M F A in, in what division of art?"
"but,"
"Well, I, I actually have a Masters of art"
and it's in art education.
"Oh, okay."
"So, I'm a licensed teacher"
"but jobs being what they are, I substitute teach"
Yeah.
and that way I have time for my kids too.
And I've been fortunate that I can afford to work part-time.
I don't know how long that's going to last
"Oh, yeah."
"And, uh, they're cutting back,"
so I don't go in all that often
"but I've been real interested in some of those cute country, country kind of things."
"Uh, I see stuff in craft galleries for five hundred dollars"
"and I say, oh no"
"and , and I go"
and I make it.
Yeah.
That's how I started jewelry making.
"I, I love to cook."
"Oh, that's great."
"And I saw a silver necklace that had these little teeny weeny silver spatulas and, and, and knife and, and a fork and all kinds of stuff"
and I went
"and I signed up for class because then again, you get, you know, get someone to guide you"
and you get the tools you don't feel like buying.
Exactly.
And I made a necklace that I saw in a gallery for three hundred twenty dollars
It took me a lot of time
"but  it didn't,"
"Oh, yeah."
Our local schools have adult education in the evening
Oh.
"uh, and I use their tools and, some of their guidance."
I'm an artist.
"Oh, okay."
And I'm very handy
"and, you know, if I touch it, it turns into something <laughter> us-, usually."
That's great.
"What, what type of art do you focus on?"
I have a Master's degree
"and, and my projects had to do with acrylic painting,"
but I'm really interested in the crafts.
Huh.
I make stain glass.
I've done some silver jewelry making
"and I kind of,"
"once I get you know, really pretty good at something, I want to try something else"
Yeah.
"Kind of jack of all trades, master of none."
"Yeah,"
"well no,"
"actually, I get good enough to sell it or have people say oh wow,"
"you didn't buy it,"
you made it.
That's great!
"And then I, it's like well the thrill is gone"
so let's do something else.
Right.
"You want to, uh, explore a new field"
"or, or,"
"Well, yeah,"
"I, I'm signed up for a class in pottery making because I've never tried that yet"
Right.
"What, uh what do you feel are important to you or other people as, as crucial benefits?"
Uh-huh.
"Well, I'm a little different than other people because I don't have benefits with my job."
Uh-huh.
I'm a nurse
"and I work,"
Oh
I float so that I have no benefits except higher pay for doing that.
Uh-huh.
Right.
Uh-huh.
So I find that it makes up for what I pay for insurance
"and I, I make enough money by the hour to make up for that."
"To, to compensate for some of the benefits."
Right.
Uh-huh.
Oh.
"Yeah,"
it's cheaper for me to buy insurance by the month than to work staff someplace.
Yes.
And then I have my freedom.
I can work seven days in a row and take a week off or whatever I want to do.
"Well, that, that's an excellent,"
"so actually that is a benefit, uh,"
"Well, it is to me."
"Most people prefer the security of nine to five, and weekends off and knowing that their insurance is paid and their retirement,"
Yeah.
and I'm just really not interested in all that.
Right.
"Right,"
"well I guess that's a good point, uh,"
Yes.
it is a mental thing.
It is a conversion thing.
"It's like a mill, you know."
"We, we do, uh, um, well we use a one mill bond wire or one point five mill bond wire on on semiconductor devices."
Right.
"And well, what's a mill"
and ...
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"But what really annoys me is the way we, in the United States, have been converting to metric."
We have a eighty-nine Chevy Blazer.
"And before that we had a Horizon. Uh, you know, Plymouth Horizon?"
Yeah.
And both of them were a mismatch of both American and metric.
"Don't you find that interesting? Uh, that they, that that they're doing that, uh, in any field,"
"for why, why, why pieces,"
"could you, could you get any connection on which was metric and which wasn't."
"Uh, okay."
The engine itself was mostly metric because it came from Canada.
"Oh, okay."
"And the starter was Bosch American,"
so.
"The bolts were, were were, were English then."
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"It was, it was annoying."
"One, one half of the starter you know, three bolts on the starter"
and two of them were American
and one of them was metric.
Now that's strange.
"And, uh, you go from the, uh, water pump up to the radiator"
"Got three bedrooms, one bath and that just makes me scream."
That's pretty tough
What area do you live in?
I live in Houston.
"Oh, okay."
I see.
Is that pretty typical for your area?
"Well, for the neighborhood I'm in,"
"yeah,"
Yeah.
"This is one of the more established neighborhoods,"
Huh-uh.
That sounds real interesting.
I live in a suburb of Dallas
"and, uh, I live in the basic three bedroom, two bath home."
"So, at least, I have two bathrooms."

What about yard space?
"Do you have lot of, a big lot, or anything like that?"
The whole lot I'm sitting on is roughly half an acre.
"Oh, I see."
"About half of that, about a quarter acre of that, I've got a garden."
Huh-uh.

Yeah.
Is it really?
How long have you had it?
"We've had him for,"
"let's see, he just had his fourth birthday."
Fourth birthday.
"Yeah,"
and we got him when he was about eight weeks old
"and, uh, he's pretty okay,"
we like him.
Does he shed a lot?
He does.
That's the one thing we don't like about him.
"In fact, we threaten him in the summertime that we might just shave all of his hair off."
He'd probably look pretty funny if we did that.
How much does he weigh now?
"He, actually, he just went to the vet yesterday to get his shots and everything,"
Uh-huh.
"He, he'd, we'd gotten a couple of books"
and then he just started doing it.
I don't know.
"He, well he did all the flooring himself."
"He put the whole, the whole floor in"
and then I just started with the walls and the roof and started there.
"And then we were, put a, like a, not, not necessarily a garage, but just like a, off the side of that"
"after we had the house part made, we just decided we'd carry the roof out a little bit farther and put a carport more or less."
"It's not, you know, it's not enclosed."
"It's just somewhere to drive another car to, to park"
"and it's,"
"Do, do you build on slabs down there or did you build it up off the ground?"
"Uh, it's off the ground."
On the piers?
Uh-huh.
"It's on about uh, twenty-two inch piers, something like that."
"Did,"
You had those poured
So.
or you did them yourself?
"Uh, no,"
"those, those are,"
we did those ourselves
so.
You just put forms in the ground and fill them with concrete?
Yeah.
Huh.
"Exactly,"
"so. It's,"

Huh.
"That's not a, that's not a good solution either."
Not at all.
"I'm not real sure what the,"
What do you think about capital punishment?
"Well, I'm kind of in favor of it for certain crimes."
Yeah.
Which crimes do you feel that?
"Well, I think first degree murder, uh, probably warrants it."
Yeah.
"Because of,"
so many times it's so brutal and just recurrent
Right.
"selling, I think should also."
Exactly.
Recurrent crimes like serial rapists or serial murderers or whatever.
Yeah
"I come from a state that has, well I originally come from the state that has, uh, the death penalty."
I come from Florida.
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, they're pretty liberal on it."
"They tend to, like, fry people left and right.  which,"
Yeah
"that's,"
go ahead.
Go ahead.
Texas is too.
"Texas, I saw on T V the other night, is the, has had forty-six in like the past several years."
Yeah.
"So they're pretty hip on it too, I guess."
"They do it by lethal injection, at Huntsville."
"the I've got my beans, peas,"
Yeah.
"I've got some onions out,  tomatoes,"
Yeah.
I'm not real sure what they're going to do this year.
I never have much luck with tomatoes.
"I do plant a lot of beans, because it seems like, the, uh, bugs get on them so easily"
"and I have a real problem with anything like pesticides or anything like that,"
"so, the only thing that I use is soap."
"I water, you know, spray the plants, because they say, supposedly, that will keep the bugs off them."
"But, uh, I don't have luck with that tomato plant,"
so I hate to spray them with anything.
"Um, what do you do?"
Do you have any tips you could give me?
"Um, my favorite one is putting on the, um, tomato plant is to put, uh, dust,"
Yeah.
Yeah.
"and that stuff has been around since the beginning of time,"
That's true.
That's true.
My dad is a farmer
"so, I've heard him talk about that forever."
"I guess it works,"
"but, um, you have to really wash your vegetables after that"
so it won't make you sick.
Let's see what else do you do to your house?
"Well, I've done some rewiring on it."
Yeah.
"Eventually, if we stay here, I'm going to have to rewire the entire house."
"Oh, really."
"Do you plan on like adding any rooms or,"
you have enough space
"this, this town was like less than ten thousand people"
and it was about sixty miles south of Dallas.
"And, you know, I didn't move out of there until I was, you know, twenty-seven"
"and that was just, you know,"
so I love the big city
"You know, I had lived in a rural area for, for so long"
"so I've enjoyed it,"
"but, uh, it can, it can get kind of tough."
Its like a rat race sometimes.
That's just something I'll never adapt to.
"I don't, I don't want to be a part of the rat race."
I want to be basically just kind of left alone.
Yeah
"If I want to sit around and mess with my garden, I'll mess with my garden,"
Yeah.
"if I want to work in the flower beds,"
Yeah.
It sounds like you enjoy working outside as well.
"I, I,"
Very much.
yeah.
I really do enjoy that.
But I haven't planted anything yet
"or, you know, I usually have gotten flowers coming out the"
"but I, I haven't done that, yet."
I've had finals this week.
"So, uh,  you know, I'm just kind of trying to, trying to stick in with that,"
Huh-uh.
"but, uh, since that's over with now, maybe I can, I can get this yard in shape."
Do you do a lot of gardening?
"Uh, landscaping is more, than the gardening,"
Yeah.
"It, it just makes your skin more leathery."
and I think that is why.
"It, uh, it,"
Exactly.
yeah.
"So,"
"I think it burns off the,"
"I don't know the, the, the theory, the scientific principle."
"But it burns something off, the natural oils or something like that."
Uh-huh.
"Well, the elasticity of your skin, the collagen or whatever they call it."
They say it destroys a lot of that.
Yes.
And you lose a lot of that.
"So, uh,"
"Yes,"
"uh, that sounds like a good, that sounds like the right theory."
"Yeah,"
"but, uh, but we have really had nice,"
"the weather,"
I can't complain.
We have really had really good weather of late.
Good.
"And when it has rained, it it's been a good soaking rain"
"and, uh, it has just been a really nice Spring."
"Well, that is great."
"It has been, it has been very nice here too."
And I hope it continues because my parents are coming to visit this evening
and I want them to have nice weather for their visit instead of driving around in the rain.
Oh.
"Oh, that is great."
How long will they be there?
"and, uh, but he's got, he's been put away for, uh, credit card fraud, I believe."
"Oh, gosh."
"Yeah,"
"Lyndon LaRouche, that's it."
Yeah.
"And, uh,"
yeah.
"Yeah,"
"people will sit home and assume, oh, that guy would never get elected."
Uh-huh.
"Next thing you know, you've got him."
Right.
"If you don't go and vote, then, you know, very good chance that they, they will because a lot of the people like that, they'll strike a chord in something, you know, in some of the people, that so will say, look, you know, this guy's got everything together."
Yeah.
"You know, I like what he says,"
and he'll be so far off the wall that they'll elect him.
"Right, yeah."
"And, uh, I think that's sort of what happened with Louisiana because, because, um, the guy did get elected, correct?"
Yeah.
Right.
That's what I thought.
"Yeah,"
he sure did.
"And, uh, , but you know, they can always fool us, you know."
He might do a good job.
Yeah.
"I think one thing that maybe would help people vote is if the polls were either open more days, or you could mail it in, or something like, if you have, if you have real strict work hours, and you can only go like at seven in the morning or after work and you have to stand in line for so long"
"Oh, yeah."

"The British Tabulating Machine Company (BTM) was a firm which manufactured and sold Hollerith unit record equipment and other data-processing equipment. During World War II, BTM constructed a number of ""bombes"", machines used at Bletchley Park to break the German Enigma machine ciphers."
"The company was formed in 1902 as The Tabulator Limited, after Robert Porter obtained the rights to sell Herman Hollerith's patented machines from the US Tabulating Machine Company (later to become IBM). By 1909, the company had been renamed the ""British Tabulating Machine Company Limited"". In 1920, the company moved from London to Letchworth, Hertfordshire; it was also at this point that it started manufacturing its own machines, rather than simply reselling Hollerith equipment."
"Annual revenues were £6K in 1915, £122K in 1925, and £170K in 1937. In 1916 there were 45 staff; this increased to 132 in 1922, 326 in 1929 and 1225 in 1939."
"In return for the exclusive right to market Hollerith equipment in Britain and the Empire (excluding Canada), BTM paid 25% of its revenues to the American company by way of royalties. This became an ever-increasing burden as the years progressed; BTM attempted to renegotiate the agreement on several occasions, but it was only finally terminated in 1948."
"During World War II, BTM was called upon to design and manufacture a machine to assist breaking the German Enigma machine ciphers. This machine, known as a Bombe, was initially conceived by Alan Turing, but the actual machine was designed by BTM chief engineer Harold 'Doc' Keen, who had led the company's engineering department throughout the 1930s. The project was codenamed ""CANTAB"". By the end of the European war, over two hundred bombes had been built and installed."
"BTM built a valve based computer called the HEC (Hollerith Electronic Computer). The first model (HEC 1) was built in 1951, an example is held by the Birmingham Museum. BTM went on to develop the HEC 2, 2M and 4 models, eventually building more than 100. The machines had a 2 kilobyte drum memory and 1000 valves, and could use punched cards for input and output, or drive a printer."

= = = Masterpiece (Roy Lichtenstein) = = =
Masterpiece is a 1962 pop art painting by Roy Lichtenstein that uses his classic Ben-Day dots and narrative content contained within a speech balloon. In 2017 the painting sold for $165 million.
"According to the Lichtenstein Foundation website, ""Masterpiece"" was part of Lichtenstein's first exhibition at Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles from April 1 – April 27, 1963, featuring ""Drowning Girl"", ""Portrait of Madame Cézanne"" and other works from 1962 and 1963 When discussing another work (""I Know...Brad""), Lichtenstein stated that the name Brad sounded heroic to him and was used with the aim of cliched oversimplification. ""Drowning Girl"" is another notable work with Brad as the heroic subject."
"The source of this image was a comic book panel with the two subjects positioned similarly to their position here, but they were situated in an automobile. In the source image the narrative content of the speech balloon said ""But someday the bitterness will pass..."""
"""Masterpiece"" was part of the largest ever retrospective of Lichtenstein that visited The Art Institute of Chicago from May 16 to September 3, 2012, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. from October 14, 2012 to January 13, 2013, the Tate Modern in London from February 21 to May 27, 2013 and The Centre Pompidou from July 3 to November 4, 2013. Several publications presented ""Masterpiece"" as part of their announcement of the retrospective."
"In January 2017, Agnes Gund sold the 1962 painting ""Masterpiece"", which for years hung over the mantle of her Upper East Side apartment, for $165 million. The proceeds of the sale will be used to start a fund for criminal justice reform called the Art for Justice fund. The painting is currently one of the 15 highest prices ever to be paid for a piece of artwork. The purchaser was Steven A. Cohen."
"""Masterpiece"" is regarded as a tongue in cheek joke that reflects upon Lichtenstein's own career. In retrospect, the joke is considered ""witty and yet eerily prescient"" because it portended some of the future turmoil that the artist would endure. In the painting, the blonde female's speech bubble, ""Why, Brad darling, This painting is a masterpiece! My, soon you'll have all of New York clamoring for your work!"" conveys her remark as she gazes at the painting, of which a corner of the back is shown. Silent Brad conveys his agreement by his facial expression. Adrian Searle of ""The Guardian"" says that the 1962 work, whose narrative and graphical content were both borrowed, was timely because Lichtenstein had his first exhibition in New York City at Leo Castelli Gallery that year, making the painting aspirational in an ironic way that comments on success and ""the socio-sexual status of the hot young artist"". The satirical commentary on Lichtenstein's career, followed the inside joke made the year before in ""Mr. Bellamy"". According to Roberta Smith of ""The New York Times"", ""Masterpiece"" was one of Lichtenstein's works created in a way that produced ""faint and uneven"" Ben Day dots."

Smila ( ) is a city located on Dnieper Upland near the Tyasmyn River. It is a district center of Cherkasy Oblast of Ukraine.
Settlements Ploske and Irdynivka are subordinated to Smila city council.
"Smila serves as the administrative center of Smila Raion (district), but is designated as a City of regional significance and does not belong to the raion."
"Climate in the city is moderate continental. Winters are soft with frequent thaws. Summers are warm, sometimes with little rain. Periods of temperatures higher than +10 endure up to 170 days. Annual precipitation level is 450–520 mm. Dnieper tributary Tyasmyn River flows through the city."
"Smila and its neighbourhood have been settled since the ancient times. Archeologists discovered a number of ruins of ancient settlements and numerous mounds located in different parts of Smila and near the city. Two biggest ancient settlements and 44 mounds were first researched during 1879–1883 years by O. O. Bobrynsky, grandson of Smila owner, Count Olexiy Olexiyovich Bobrynsky. These findings belong partly to the Stone Age and partly to the Bronze age."
Official foundation date of Smila is 1542. Grand Duchy of Lithuania documents tell us that settlement Yatzkove-Tyasmyno was founded on a hamlet place in 1542. The modern name of the city has been known since the first half of the 17th century.
"City’s name is connected with a local legend first recorded by Count L. O. Bobrynsky: ""An unknown girl led warriors through a heavy swamp showing a route to the enemy. The battle was very bloody. They killed a lot of enemies there but they couldn’t save the brave girl. They buried her near Tyasmyn and called her Smila. Then warriors honoured her in the city’s name."""
"After the Union of Lublin in July 1569, it was a settlement of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth."
During 1648 — 1667  this squadron town belonged to Chyhyryn Regiment. In 1654 Russian tsar gave Pereyaslav colonel Pavlo Teteria possession of the town. During 1658-1659 Danylo Vyhovsky changed Teterya as the owner.
"Chudniv treaty of 1660 renewed Polish power on this land. Smila became an ownership of Stanislav Koniecpolski as part of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Constant wars between Ukrainian Cossacks, Polish owners, Tatars, Turks, Russians and Swedes led to demolition of Smila. (More The Ruin)"
"Further owners of Smila, princes Lubomirski built a wooden castle with arbor and palisade around the whole city in 1742."
"During 1730s-1760s parts of the population of Smila took part in Haidamaka movement. In 1787 prince Xaveriy Lubomirski sold lands around Smila to Russian prince Potyomkin. Six years later Smila became a property of Potyomkin’s nephew, Count Alexander Samoylov. Two years later population of Smila was 1747 people with 50 crafters, 9 shoemakers, 6 weavers, 8 tailors. Others were peasants."
After second Partition of Poland Smela was a township which subordinated to Cherkassy county of Kiev Governorate of the Russian Empire. In 1838 was built here.

"Margaret Myrtle ""Mitzi"" Hoag (September 25, 1932 – February 26, 2019) was an American actress. Over the course of her career, she appeared in more than 73 different TV shows and movies. Notable among these are recurring roles in ""We'll Get By"", ""Bonanza"", ""Here Come the Brides"", and ""The Partridge Family""."
"Hoag was raised in North Olmsted, Ohio, near Cleveland, where she was born. Her father, John C. Hoag, was a supervisor for the A&P store chain. She graduated from John Marshall High School in 1949. A straight-A student and head majorette of the marching band, she appeared in numerous high school stage productions, already using the nickname ""Mitzi"". After high school, Hoag attended Shimer College, then located in Mount Carroll, Illinois, completing her degree in two years under the radically flexible University of Chicago curriculum of Robert Maynard Hutchins. She chose Shimer for its small classes and the opportunity for horseback riding. Because Shimer was then closely affiliated with the University of Chicago, she is sometimes reported as having graduated from there."
"When Hoag graduated from Shimer at age 19 in 1952, she was one of the first five Shimer students to receive the bachelor's degree. She was the only woman in the graduating class. She earned a bachelor of arts in general education, and became a certified teacher, but her experiences with drama at Shimer turned her towards an acting career. After leaving Shimer, Hoag studied drama at the graduate level at Case Western Reserve University for two years."
"In the mid-1950s, Hoag moved to New York, where she continued her study of acting with Herbert Berghof. She was cast in multiple off-Broadway shows, but these were all cancelled due to funding problems. Finally, she starred in the title role of the 1958 off-Broadway hit ""Heloise"", an adaptation by James Forsyth of the story of Heloise and Abelard. The play, which won considerable critical acclaim, was produced primarily by erstwhile actors and staffers of Case Western's Eldred Theatre."
"Hoag subsequently went to Hollywood, on her mother's advice. There she married Stephen Wolfson, who had a bit part in ""Heloise"", and later became a teacher. They had a daughter together, but subsequently divorced."
"In Hollywood, Hoag at first worked as a stage actress. She parlayed a successful stage performance as Annie Sullivan in ""The Miracle Worker"" into screen roles, starting with a role in the movie ""Tammy and the Doctor"", and continuing with numerous TV appearances."
"In the late 1960s, Hoag had a recurring role in ""Here Come the Brides"" in the late 1960s. In addition, from 1966 to 1972, she appeared frequently in the TV show ""Bonanza"" as Alice Brenner. In 1976, she appeared in the drama ""Family"" as Clara Briault. During this period, she also appeared in several movies, including ""Play It as It Lays"", ""Pieces of Dreams"", and ""Devil's Angels""."
"She also played Natalie Green's adoptive mother on ""The Facts of Life"", a role she played through all 9 seasons."
"Hoag's first and only starring role in a TV series came in 1975, when she appeared as the mother Liz Platt in the CBS sitcom ""We'll Get By"", starring opposite Paul Sorvino. A family sitcom, the show was created by Alan Alda, and modeled after his own domestic life. The show ran to twelve episodes, filmed in front of a live studio audience. Originally scheduled for September 1974, the show did not air until March 1975, in a time slot facing ""Chico and the Man"", one of NBC's most popular programs. It was not renewed."

"João Oliveira dos Santos (born 15 January 1933) better known as Mestre João Grande, is a Grão-Mestre (Grand Master) of the Afro-Brazilian martial art of capoeira angola who has contributed to the spread of this art throughout the world. He was a student of the ""father of Angola"", Mestre Pastinha, and has an academy in New York City."
"Mestre João Grande was born in the village of Itagi in the south of the Brazilian state of Bahia. As a child he worked alongside his family in the fields. At the age of 10 he saw ""corta capim"" for the first time. This is a movement performed by crouching down, extending one leg in front and swinging it around in a circle, hopping over it with the other leg. Fascinated, he asked what it was called and was told that it was ""the Dance of the Nagos"" — a dance of the African descendants in the city of Salvador. The Yoruba of Southwest Nigeria had a major cultural influence in Salvador, which was considered the Black Rome of Brazil. But the dance was actually of Central African origin— it was Capoeira. João didn't learn the correct name of the movement until many years later, but it changed his life forever. At the age of ten he left home in search of ""the Dance of the Nagos""."
"Ten years later, he ended up in Brazil, the birthplace of capoeira as we know it, where he saw a proper capoeira roda for the first time. Present were mestres Menino Gordo, João Pequeno, who was there with his first teacher, Mestre Barbosa, and Cobrinha Verde, one of the most skillful players of that era."
"João Grande asked Mestre Barbosa if he could study and Mestre Barbosa sent him to João Pequeno, who later became his closest associate in capoeira. João Pequeno sent him to Mestre Pastinha who had a famous academy in the Cardeal Pequeno neighborhood of Brotas. João Grande requested permission to join his academy, and Pastinha accepted João as a student at the age of twenty, relatively late in capoeira life. While studying, João Grande worked as a longshoreman, playing after work or on his few days off."
"Mestre João Grande eventually became such an acclaimed capoeirista that when Carybé, a painter famous for his documentation of African Culture in Bahia, chose to do studies of capoeira he chose João Grande as a model."
"João Grande and João Pequeno are featured in numerous films of capoeira including one in which they demonstrate the knife techniques of the art. In 1966 João Grande travelled to Senegal with Mestre Pastinha to demonstrate capoeira at the first World Festival of Black Arts in Dakar. He was awarded his Diploma of capoeira from Pastinha in 1968 making him a full-fledged master of capoeira Angola. He subsequently toured Europe and the Middle East with Viva Bahia, a pioneering group that performed Afro-Brazilian folk arts such as capoeira, samba, maculelê, candomblé and puxada da rede."
"Eventually Pastinha's academy fell on hard times. Pastinha, was asked by the government to vacate his building for renovations, but the space was never returned to him. Instead it became a restaurant with entertainment, now called SENAC. Pastinha died broke and bitter about his treatment, but never regretted living the life of a capoeirista."
"João Grande returned when Mestre Moraes and Mestre Cobra Mansa persuaded him to come out of retirement in the mid-1980s. He began to teach with their organization Grupo Capoeira Angola Pelourinho. In 1989 he was invited by Jelon Vieira to tour the United States. The tour was a tremendous success. In 1990 he returned to present capoeira at the National Black Arts Festival in Atlanta, Georgia and at the Schomberg Center for Research for Black Culture in New York City. João Grande decided he liked the US and has been teaching in New York City ever since."
"In 1995 he received a Doctorate of Humane Letters from Upsala College, East Orange, New Jersey. In 2001 he was awarded the National Heritage Fellowship from the NEA, which is one of the most prestigious awards given to practitioners of traditional arts in the US. He has also recorded an audio CD and several DVDs featuring himself and his students, as well as other illustrious figures of capoeira Angola."

"Clinton ""Dusty"" Fletcher (July 8, 1900 – March 15, 1954) was an African-American vaudeville performer, who was best known for the comedy routine which became a hit record in 1947, ""Open the Door, Richard""."
He had one daughter Helen Fletcher with original Cotton Club Dancer Sadie Mae Fletcher. He had two granddaughters Jacqueline and Amber.
"Born in El Dorado, Arkansas, Fletcher had refined his act over at least twenty years in vaudeville before the 1940s. He would come on stage dressed in rags, acting drunk, muttering and complaining about trying to find his way home. He would then bring out a ladder, and try to set it up so he could get in through a window. Every so often he would crash sprawling on the floor while shouting ""Open the Door, Richard !""."
"In 1946, bandleader Jack McVea fashioned Fletcher's routine into the lyrics of a song, which he recorded with his band. McVea's record became a big hit, and Fletcher, by now semi-retired, was found living in South Carolina by Herb Abramson of National Records. He made his own recording of the song, using McVea's arrangement, which made number 3 on US ""Billboard"" R&B chart. The song was also covered by many others including Count Basie, Louis Jordan, and Pigmeat Markham."
"National Records began a lawsuit to claim Fletcher's royalties as the originator of the routine which led to McVea's hit. However, a blackface vaudeville comedian, John ""Spider Bruce"" Mason then claimed that Fletcher had originally stolen the routine from him in the 1920s. Eventually, McVea, Fletcher and Mason were all co-credited with writing McVea's version."
"Fletcher is credited with originating the ""Here come de Judge"" line used on the television comedy show, ""Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In""."
"The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) publicly attacked the song, particularly Fletcher's version, for making light of public drunkenness and playing on the stereotype of black men as shiftless and ignorant."

The founding board consisted of Riyadh Bahr Al-Ouloom, Abbas Fakhruddin, Firas Nouri, Haitham Abbas, Ali Juwad, Yasin Khudhair, Mustafa Mohammed, Hassan Juwad, Wisam Fawzi and Basim Radhi. The club entered the Iraq Division Two and was promoted to the Iraq Division One in the 2010–11 season. In the 2011–12 season, Naft Al-Wasat made their first transfer from other clubs, signing Karrar Abd from Kufa FC in January 2012. In the 2011–12 season, Naft Al-Wasat barely qualified to the second stage, after having 8 wins, 6 draws and 4 losses, only a point away from Kufa FC. In the second stage, Naft Al-Wasat finished in 4th place of the Group 2, at 12 points, after having 4 wins and 4 losses, ending their first season in the Division One with failure."
"In the 2012–13 season, Naft Al-Wasat failed again to qualify. In the groups stage, they became in top of Group D, at 27 points, being won 7 matches, drawn in 5 and lost only one. In the second stage they had a big breakdown, finishing in 5th place in Group 2, after winning only one match, drawing in 5 and losing 3. In the 2012–13 Iraq FA Cup, they reached the third round before being eliminated. In the first round, they defeated Samawa 4–0, and in the second round they eliminated Al-Sinaat Al-Kahrabaiya by beating them 4–3 on aggregate (the first leg was 1–1 and the second leg was 3–2).

"After the end of the 2013–14 season, the club made major changes to get ready for the 2014–15 Iraqi Premier League with the total of 8 players signed, but the most important signing was Noor Sabri. Naft Al-Wasat were one of the teams that weren't expected to qualify to the second stage. Despite losing a third of their games in the first stage, finishing in 4th position out of ten teams in their group, Naft Al-Wasat just about managed to qualify for the final stage, after wins against the likes of Erbil and Al-Zawraa; this itself was considered a big success for the young team. In the second stage, the team surprised everyone by defeating Al Shorta SC (the defending champions and one of the strongest contenders for the league championship) twice. After taking the Group 1 lead, Naft Al-Wasat got qualified to the league final, where they won over Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya via a penalty shoot-out."
"Their league title win qualified them for the 2016 AFC Cup. They finished top of Group B with a record of five wins and one loss, but they lost 1–0 in the round of 16 to Al-Jaish. They were not allowed to play their home matches in Iraq in this tournament due to security concerns. In the 2015–16 Iraqi Premier League, Naft Al-Wasat finished in second place in their group, behind eventual champions Al-Zawraa, to qualify for the final stage. In the final stage, Naft Al-Wasat finished as runners-up, again behind Al-Zawraa. As the league's runners-up, Naft Al-Wasat qualified for the 2016–17 Arab Club Championship, where they got revenge on Al-Jaish by knocking them out to qualify for the group stage."

Most of the first half of the trail, as far as Arnos Park, runs beside Pymmes Brook, but after that the brook is only encountered intermittently as much of the brook passes through private land which is not open to the public. In its lower reaches sections of the brook have been culverted to alleviate the risk of flooding."
"The trail starts on Hadley Green, where the headwaters of Pymmes Brook rise, with a link from High Barnet tube station. Together with the London Loop, it then drops through Monken Hadley Common to Jack's Lake, to meet another link from Cockfosters tube station. Pymmes Brook proper starts here as it flows out from Jack's Lake. The trail detours through Victoria Recreation Ground, where Pymmes Brook is joined with Shirebourne brook, then follows a short street section to rejoin the brook at East Barnet Village. It then runs beside the brook through Oak Hill Park and Brunswick Park to the halfway point in Arnos Park, with a link to Arnos Grove tube station. It is also where Pymmes Brook is joined by Bounds Green Brook. The trail then leaves the brook to pass through Broomfield Park and Palmers Green. It crosses over the New River at Oakthorpe Road, then the North Circular Road, to divert through two new public open spaces - Bowes Meadow and Tile Kiln Lane Open Space - where Pymmes Brook can be followed again. The trail recrosses the North Circular Road onto Silver Street, Edmonton, where the path enters the gardens of Millfield House. From here the trail leads to Pymmes Park and another brookside section, then to Fore Street, where the brook flows underground to merge with Salmons Brook to the south of Angel Road. As of 2018, the trail must temporarily follow public throughfares for a short distance, but will eventually take a new route when access to the brook is opened up in the Meridian Water development. Finally, the trail passes through Tottenham Marshes, beside Pymmes Brook and past Stonebridge Lock on the Lee Navigation, to reach the point where the brook joins the River Lea.

Whizziwig has the ability to grant wishes to anyone who uttered the words ""I wish.."", however wishes had to be made for someone else and would last a maximum of 24 hours. A recurring theme is Ben and Steve trying to deceive their friend into granting their intentional wishes only for the alien to become wise to the scheme."

The Kuha class minesweepers () is a series of six inshore minesweepers of the Finnish Navy. The ships were constructed in 1974-1975. All the vessels of the class were modified and modernized in the late 1990s. This included a lengthening of the hull.
"The vessels have a glass fibre hull and are amongst the largest vessels built in this material. They are equipped with hydraulic machinery, and its engines are placed in the aft part of the superstructure. The engines are separated from the hull with rubber springs. The engine power is transferred to the propeller unit (which can turn 360 degrees) through two separate hydraulic valves; in this manner the vessels are as quiet as possible, and it has been possible to completely eliminate propeller axles, which are very difficult to silence and are easily damaged in mine explosions."
"The vessels are very lightly armed with only a twin anti-aircraft gun and a couple of heavy machine guns; ""Kuha 22"" is an exception, as it assumes an anti-aircraft readiness role. It is therefore equipped with a couple more guns than its sister vessels."
"The ""Kuha"" class vessels usually operate together with some vessels of the ""Kiiski"" class, and they can sweep both impact and influence mines."

"The Corps of Artillery of the Irish Army was founded in 1924, and based in Connolly Barracks in the Curragh Camp. The Patron saint of the corps is Saint Barbara, and she appears on the corps insignia sitting astride a cannon. The 31st FAR came into being on 1 October 2005, and was made up of units from the former reserve structure, the FCÁ. The units which were disbanded in order to form the new 31st FAR were the 8th FAR (Cork), 3rd FAR (Tipperary) and part of the 14th Infantry Battalion also from Tipperary."
The 8th FAR was originally formed in Ballincollig in 1979. It was made up of the reserve batteries which had once formed part of the 1st FAR. The regiment consisted of two batteries: 2nd Battery (25 Pounder field guns) and 21st Heavy Mortar Battery (120 mm Mortars). The unit moved to Collins Barracks in Cork City following the closure of Ballincollig Barracks. 2nd Battery and 21st Battery merged to become 1st Battery of the 31st FAR on 1 October 2005.
"The unit had both ceremonial and training commitments, with annual artillery practice held in the Glen of Imaal in Co Wicklow in July of each year. A camp was also held around Easter time which focused on small arms training. Reservists from this unit were often invited to participate in training courses outside the unit, and members also participated in Defence Forces sporting events and shooting competitions, and have won several medals across a variety of events."
"The Pistol Team from 1st Battery was in the forefront of army shooting competitions for some years. In January 2005, members of the 8th FAR (later the 1st Battery) were called upon to take part in a ceremonial 21-gun salute in honour of the City of Cork becoming the European Capital of Culture. Other ceremonial duties have included committing a contingent of reservists to represent the 1st Southern Brigade at the National Day of Remembrance ceremony at Kilmainham. Reservists in the 31st FAR were also trained in Infantry Tactics, Amphibious operations, Fighting in Built Up Areas (FIBUA) and Peace Support Operations."

Albelin was drafted 152nd overall by Quebec in the 1983 NHL Entry Draft. Before joining the club he played five seasons for Djurgårdens IF in the Swedish Elitserien, winning the Swedish championship in his first year (1982–83). Albelin left for Quebec upon the conclusion of the 1986-87 season. He played a year and a half for the Nordiques before being traded to New Jersey.

"Witteric (; Portuguese and Galician: ""Viterico""; 565 – April 610) was the Visigoth King of Hispania, Septimania and Galicia. He ruled from 603 to 610."
"The first mention of Witteric in history was as a conspirator with Sunna, the Arian bishop of Mérida, to reestablish Arianism in 589. While Sunna was sent into exile, it is unknown what happened to Witteric. In the spring of 602, Witteric was given command of the army with the job of expelling the Byzantines. However, when it came time to do so in the Spring of 603, Witteric instead led his troops against King Liuva II, counting on the support of a faction of nobles in opposition to the dynasty of Leovigild. He invaded the royal palace and deposed the young king. Witteric cut off the king's right hand, and then had him condemned and executed in the Summer of 603."
"During his reign, the Visigoths fought the Byzantines. However, Isidore of Seville is dismissive of Witteric's accomplishments, writing that ""although he frequently fought battles against the Roman soldiers, he did not win any adequate glory except for capturing some soldiers at Sagunto with the help of his generals."" The campaign against Sagunto probably took place in 605. It was probably during his reign, as well, that Bigastrum (near Cartago Nova) was taken, as its bishop appears in a council of Toledo in 610."
"In the twelfth year of his reign, king Theodoric II sent for bishop Aridius of Lyons and the constable Eborin to ask Witteric for his daughter Ermenburga's hand in marriage. Although the envoys gave their word that she would not be disowned by Theodoric, and she was received by Theodoric in Chalon-sur-Saône (606), his grandmother, the regent Brunhilda and Theodoric's sister Teudila (or Teudilana) did not provide a welcoming reception. Theodoric then disgraced Ermenberga by sending her back without her dowry. Incensed, Witteric entered into a quadruple alliance with Theodobert II of Austrasia, Clotaire II of Neustria, and Agilulf of the Lombards to effect his deposition and death. Despite their mutual fear of Theodoric, their alliance did not accomplish anything; according to Fredegar, ""Theodoric got wind of it [the alliance] but treated it with utter contempt.""."
"In April 610, a faction of Catholic nobles conspired against Witteric and assassinated him during a banquet. His body was dragged ignominiously through the streets and he was later buried without the honors corresponding to his status. The nobles then proclaimed Gundemar, Duke of Narbonne, king."

(In an interview packaged with the DVD release, John Greyson notes the real Blank and Jacobsz began their relationship when they were very young - Blank having been imprisoned on Robben Island at age 16 - and were actually known to be a couple for twenty years before they were charged with sodomy and executed, when they were both nearly 40.) Intentional anachronisms - such as transistor radios, electric typewriters and jeeps - are also used in the film to illustrate Greyson's larger theme that homophobia and racism of the type that led to Blank's and Jacobsz' executions are still very much present in today's world. These twentieth-century objects, including modern (c. 1964) dress on many occasions, are invariably presented in juxtaposition with eighteenth-century items. The eighteenth-century prison commandant, for example, is replaced by a former subordinate, who wears a twentieth-century guard's uniform and is often accompanied by a fierce-looking Alsatian on a short lead. A 'wetbag' is seen, as it was used as a torture devise in Apartheid South Africa."
"An extract from the speech Nelson Mandela made at his sentencing hearing in 1964, before he was imprisoned on Robben Island, is displayed at the end of the film."
= = = WLMG = = =
"WLMG (101.9 MHz, ""Magic 101.9 FM"") is a commercial FM radio station licensed to New Orleans, Louisiana. Owned by Entercom, it broadcasts an adult contemporary radio format. From mid-November to December 25th each year, it switches to all-Christmas music. The station's studios and offices are located at the 400 Poydras Tower in New Orleans' downtown district."
"WLMG has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 100,000 watts, the maximum for non-grandfathered FM stations. The transmitter site is off Bahrman Highway in the Algiers neighborhood of New Orleans. WLMG broadcasts in the HD Radio hybrid format."
"On March 15, 1970, the station first signed on the air as WWL-FM. It was owned by Loyola University of the South, now known as Loyola University New Orleans. Loyola also owned Channel 4 WWL-TV and AM powerhouse 870 WWL."
WWL and WWL-FM had the same call sign but separate formats. The AM was a full service middle of the road station while WWL-FM played beautiful music. It featured quarter hour sweeps of instrumental cover versions of popular songs with Hollywood and Broadway show tunes.
"In the mid-1970s, station management decided to go in a radically different direction, seeking a younger demographic for WWL-FM. Out went the soft instrumental musicians such as Henry Mancini and Percy Faith, trading them in for Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney. WWL-FM flipped to a Top 40 sound. But this was an era where most young people still were listening to inexpensive AM radios for their favorite hits. The station failed to make much headway against AM Top 40 leader 690 WTIX (now WQNO)."
"By May 1976, WWL-FM returned to easy listening music. The format featured mostly instrumental songs with several soft vocals each hour. On December 26, 1980, to separate the FM station's image from its AM and TV counterparts, the call letters were changed to WAJY. The station, calling itself ""Joy 102,"" moved closer to a 50/50 mix of instrumentals and vocals, some from soft rock artists such as Elton John, Olivia Newton-John, Stevie Wonder and Chicago."
"Through the 1980s, the easy format saw its audience continuing to age, while most advertisers seek young and middle-aged listeners. In 1987, the station completed its transition to a soft adult contemporary sound, eliminating the instrumental songs. The call sign was changed to WLMG using the moniker ""Magic 102."" With most radios in the 1990s going from analog dials to digital, the station began calling itself ""Magic 101.9"" in 1995."
"Over the next decade, WWL and WLMG switched hands several times. In 1989, Loyola University sold the stations to Keymarket Communications. The TV station was sold to a group of its employees, using the name Rampart Broadcasting. In July 1995, the radio stations were acquired by River City Communications. Later ownership switched to Sinclair Broadcasting. And in December 1999, WWL and WLMG were acquired by Entercom."
"In the early 2000s, WLMG moved to a mainstream adult contemporary sound. The tempo of the songs was picked up and the disc jockeys added more personality. The playlist extends from the 1980s to current day AC hits. In 2006, the WWL-FM call sign returned to New Orleans, on another station. Entercom decided to give AM 870 WWL an FM simulcast on 105.3 MHz, allowing WWL listeners the choice to hear the station on FM or AM."

"Louis Armstrong Stadium was a tennis stadium of the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center and one of the venues of the U.S. Open. Armstrong was the main stadium before Arthur Ashe Stadium opened in 1997, after which it served as the No. 2 stadium. It is named after the noted jazz musician Louis Armstrong, who lived nearby until his death in 1971 and was a significant figure in the Civil Rights Movement."
"The stadium was originally built as the Singer Bowl for the 1964 New York World's Fair, and hosted special events and concerts afterwards. It was renamed the Louis Armstrong Stadium in 1973 but closed the following year."
"In the early 1970s, the United States Tennis Association was looking for a new place to host the US Open as relations with the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills, which had hosted the tournament, were breaking down. The USTA was initially unable to find a sufficient site, but the association's incoming president, W.E. Hester saw the old Singer Bowl from the window of an airplane flying into LaGuardia Airport. The old, long rectangular stadium was heavily renovated and divided into two venues, becoming the square Louis Armstrong Stadium, with the remaining third becoming the attached Grandstand, with a seating capacity of about 6,000."
"In 1997, the stadium was replaced as the US Open's primary venue by the new Arthur Ashe Stadium. Armstrong Stadium was renovated again, with the top tiers of seating being removed. The stadium held close to 18,000 at its peak, but this was reduced to around 10,200 with the renovation, which also added a brick facade to match that of Ashe Stadium."
The stadium was demolished in October 2016.
"A new 14,000-seat Louis Armstrong Stadium opened for the 2018 US Open. This new stadium features a retractable roof and is the largest of No. 2 stadium at a Grand Slam site. For the 2017 tournament, while construction was still ongoing on the new stadium, a temporary 8,800-seat stadium was built on the site of the demolished ticket office and East Gate entrance, on Parking Lot B, close to the boardwalk ramp to the subway and LIRR trains."

"Ion I. Moța [or Motza] (5 July 1902, Orăștie, Austria-Hungary—13 January 1937, Majadahonda, Spain) was the Romanian nationalist deputy leader of the Iron Guard killed in battle during the Spanish Civil War."
"Son of the nationalist Orthodox priest Ioan Moța, who edited a journal called ""Liberty"", Ion I. Moța studied law at University of Paris (1920-1921), the University of Cluj, University of Iași and University of Grenoble. His thesis, finished in 1932 at the University of Grenoble, was entitled ""Juridical Security in the Community of Nations."""
"At Cluj, he founded Acțiunea Românească (""Romanian Action""), a nationalist group inspired by Charles Maurras' Action Française. This organization fused with A. C. Cuza's National-Christian Defense League in 1925. Moța met Corneliu Zelea Codreanu at a meeting of antisemitic students in August 1923. The two formed a plan to assassinate Romanian politicians and leaders of Romanian Jewry seen as traitors and corruptors of Romanian national life. They were arrested in Bucharest on 8 October 1923 and sent to Văcărești prison. Acquitted in March 1924, Moța shot Vernichescu, the member of their conspiracy who betrayed it to the authorities, seven times (but not fatally). He spent two months in Galata prison before being acquitted and released on 29 September 1924."
"Codreanu made Moța leader of ""Frăția de Cruce"", a group of peasants and students who would fight for nationalistic renewal (founded on 6 May 1924). Moța attended the World Anti-Semitic Congress in September 1925; upon the founding of the Iron Guard (the ""Legion of the Archangel Michael""), on 24 June 1927, he became deputy Captain to Codreanu."
"Ion Moța represented the Legion at the 1934 Fascist International meeting in Montreux. He was vice-president of the Iron Guard political creation, the ""Everything for the Country Party"". From 1934 through 1936, he served as a correspondent for ""Welt-Dienst"" / ""World-Service"", an anti-Jewish publication founded by Ulrich Fleischhauer in Erfurt, Germany. Fleischhauer was a staunch believer in the veracity of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion and appeared as an ""expert witness"" for the pro-Nazis at the famous Berne Trial."
"In late 1936, Moța formed a Legionary unit to fight against the Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War. He and Vasile Marin (another prominent Legionary) were killed on the Madrid Front on the same day of fighting (13 January 1937). Their funerals in Bucharest (13 February 1937) were an immense and orderly procession (""see Funerals of Ion Moța and Vasile Marin""), attended by the Ministers of Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Francisco Franco's Spain, representatives of Portugal, the Japan of the early Shōwa period, and delegates of the Polish Patriotic Youth."
"Jude Maverick has grown up in an isolated town called Ciel, which is completely enclosed in a large sphere floating thousands of feet above the surface of Filgaia. His sheltered world changes forever when he sees the sky ""tear"" and ships enter his homeland. Upon inspecting the campsite set up by the intruders, he sees something else that he has never seen before: a girl."
"The girl's name is Yulie Ahtreide and she is being held captive by the intruders after being captured by a ""Drifter"" for hire, Arnaud G. Vasquez. After the invading army attacks Ciel and brings the sphere crashing down, Jude, Yulie and Arnaud join forces to find the army's true intention behind Yulie's abduction. With the help of another Drifter, Raquel Appelgate, these four idealistic teens travel the war-torn land of Filgaia in search of truth, their own identities, and their separate paths to adulthood."
"Action elements on the field map such as double-jumps, using the new ""Accelerator"" ability to manipulate time, and equipping items to solve puzzles maintains the excitement between battles. Movie events are presented in a distinctive use of polygons and shading with voice-actors. Dialog takes place using various character illustrations that change and reposition frequently."
"Dialog takes place using various character illustrations that change and reposition frequently like a digital comic book, making it easier to deeply understand the emotions of each character."
"The HEX battle system is composed of seven hexagons on the battle field, with random beginning placement for all characters and enemies. What makes the HEX battle system so unique is that it is area based instead of character based. This means that any attacks or spells given to certain hexagon, or HEX, will affect all characters on that HEX. Multiple allies or enemies can occupy a single HEX, but enemies and allies can't occupy the same HEX."

"In the North American version, two monsters (Dalawa Bunny and Accident Rabbit) were taken out of the game, but not out of the monsters list, making it impossible to finish the game with 100% completion. The PAL version still contains this error, and is also known to crash in certain places when played in 50 Hz mode, leaving those areas potentially impassable to players whose television does not support 60 Hz PAL signals."
Some PAL copies also have another issue where triggering specific Material summons would freeze the game. A workaround is to disable the battle movies in the game's options. This bug affects both PAL and NTSC modes.
"The English localization copy is known to freeze when loading the area at the top of a ladder at ""The Great Wall"" roughly 5 hours into the game when played in PAL mode. A workaround can be achieved by saving the game in the area prior and loading the game in NTSC mode, going past and saving on the world map. No other areas are known to have this problem."

= = = Kichai people = = =
"The Kichai tribe (also Keechi or Kitsai) was a Native American Southern Plains tribe that lived in Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma. Their name for themselves was K'itaish."
"The Kichai were most closely related to the Pawnee. French explorers encountered them on the Red River in Louisiana in 1701. By 1772, they were primarily settled around the east of the Trinity River, near present-day Palestine, Texas. After forced relocation, they came to share portions of southern and southwestern Oklahoma with the Wichita and in the Muscogee Creek Nation."
"The Kichai were part of the complex, shifting political alliances of the South Plains. Early Europeans identified them as enemies of the Caddo. In 1712, they fought the Hainai along the Trinity River; however, they were allied with other member tribes of the Caddoan Confederacy and intermarried with the Kadohadacho during this time."
"On November 10, 1837, the Texas Rangers fought the Kichai in the Battle of Stone Houses. The Kichai were victorious, despite losing their leader in the first attack."
"Caddo-Wichita-Delaware lands were broken up to individual allotments in the beginning of the 20th century. Kichai people's allotted lands were mainly in Caddo County, Oklahoma. Forty-seven full-blood Kichai lived in Oklahoma in 1950. There were only four at the end of the 20th century."
"The Kichai are not a distinct federally recognized tribe, but they are instead enrolled in the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes. These tribes live mostly in Southwestern Oklahoma, particularly in Caddo County, to which they were forcibly relocated by the United States Government in the 19th century."
"The Kichai language is a member of the Caddoan language family, along with Arikara, Pawnee, and Wichita."
"Kai Kai, a Kichai woman from Anadarko, Oklahoma, was the last known fluent speaker of the Kichai language. She collaborated with Dr. Alexander Lesser to record and document the language."

He has also acted in many comedy and drama series including ""Perfect World"", ""French and Saunders"", ""Spaced"", ""EastEnders"", Coronation Street, ""Pie in the Sky"" with Richard Griffiths."
"Litten’s first sitcom was ""Benidorm"", which began airing on ITV in 2007. The series follows various groups of holiday makers and staff in the all-inclusive Solana resort located in Benidorm. The series starred actors and actresses such as Johnny Vegas, Sheila Reid, Chrissy Rock, Selina Griffiths and Sherrie Hewson. The series received strong ratings and later extended its runtime from 30 minutes to an hour. The show ran for 10 series ending in 2018."
"He wrote an episode of ""Not Going Out"", and is also the credited writer of an episode of the ""Only Fools and Horses"" spin-off ""Green Green Grass""."
"In 2013, a one-off sketch was produced for Sport Relief featuring the ""Benidorm"" cast. The sketch involved several of the characters singing on ""Britain's Got Talent""."
"Litten also wrote a remake episode of ""Are You Being Served?"" which three of the cast had previously appeared in ""Benidorm"", Sherrie Hewson, John Challis and Niky Wardley. It was poorly received by audiences and critics."
"Derren studied acting at The Central School of Speech and Drama where he met Catherine Tate. He left Central in 1993 and worked as a jobbing actor for 10 years appearing in shows such as ""Green Wing"", ""Pie In The Sky"", ""Spaced"", ""French & Saunders"", ""Doc Martin"", ""Eastenders"", ""Casualty"" and ""Perfect World"" but it was not until 2003 when Catherine asked Derren to write sketches for her TV show. Litten agreed despite having no experience in script writing, or indeed any formal qualifications at all having left Hessle High School (East Yorkshire) without a single O level or GCSE. In 2004 Derren was nominated for a BAFTA Craft award in the category of Best New Writer."
"After two series and a Christmas Special (2005) writing for and appearing in ""The Catherine Tate Show"", Derren met writer John Sullivan who asked if he would be interested in contributing to his ""Only Fools & Horses"" spin off ""The Green Green Grass"". Derren wrote one episode and co-wrote another with John."
"In 2006, Derren penned his own comedy for ITV based in a Spanish all inclusive holiday resort. ""Benidorm"" turned out to be a ratings hit for ITV and was also won for a BAFTA in the category of Situation Comedy. From series 3 onwards the half-hour sitcom was turned into an hour-long show. In October 2011 Constable & Robinson published Derren's book to accompany the series, ""The Benidorm Guide to A Happy Holiday"". Benidorm has won numerous awards including 7 National Television Awards. Series 5 began transmission in February 2012 and Series 6 began transmission in January 2014. Derren did not take a regular acting part in ""Benidorm"" but instead appears briefly throughout the series in a number of small cameo roles. In January 2013 SKY LIVING announced its new sitcom ""The Spa"", written and created by Derren and starring Rebecca Front, would air from 7 February 2013.

"After failing as a rapper, Matthesen started his stand-up career at the Danish Stand-Up Championship in 1993, where he finished in second place. After making a name on this scene, as well as through his comedy radio stories, he also contributed to several other projects. For example, a television ""Julekalender"", ""Jul på Vesterbro"", featured fourteen characters of his invention, all of them played by himself. These included the drunken, prostitute-addicted sailor Stewart Stardust, and his junkie son, Danny. The story revolves around Stewart's hot dog stand, which a band of terrorists attempts to use to detonate a nuclear device during a UN meeting in Copenhagen."

"At the time the song was written, Robert Smith was very interested in the work of Australian author Patrick White. According to a number of his fans, Smith was inspired to write ""The Love Cats"" after reading White's novel ""The Vivisector"" (1970), although this claim is difficult to verify. In the novel, the protagonist, Hurtle, is appalled when his lover's husband drowns a sack of stray cats. White draws a parallel between the way in which the cats are discarded, and the treatment of certain characters in the book; by extension, the cats symbolize the most innocent and vulnerable members of society, and the casual cruelty with which they sometimes meet their fate."
"The music video features a number of cats and a large lampshade falling on the head of bassist Phil Thornalley. There are many shots of a mansion which the band told a buyer they were interested in buying it. They returned the keys in the morning. Real cats were supposed to be used but after proving to be troublesome, taxidermied ones were used in the place of cats. Smith said of the video: ""'The Love Cats' is far from being my favourite song: composed drunk, video filmed drunk, promotion made drunk. It was a joke."""

"International Workers' Olympiads were an international sporting event arranged between 1925 and 1937 by Socialist Workers' Sport International (SASI). It was an organisation supported by social democratic parties and International Federation of Trade Unions. Workers' Olympiads were an alternate event for the Olympic Games. The participants were members of various labor sports associations and came mostly from Europe. Nowadays the CSIT World Sports Games are the successor sports events of the International Workers' Olympiads. The ""World Sports Games"" is the main highlight and a new Brand of the CSIT. It is a unique major sports event for thousands of workers and amateurs every two years. The CSIT (International Workers and Amateurs in Sports Confederation) is an international Multi-Sports Organization."
"The Workers' Olympiads were created as a counterweight for the Olympic Games, which were criticized for being confined for the upper social classes and privileged people. The international workers' sports movement did not believe that the true Olympic spirit could be achieved in an Olympic movement dominated by the aristocratic leadership. Pierre de Coubertin, founder of the International Olympic Committee, had always opposed women's participation and supported the cultural superiority of white Europeans over other races. His followers, Henri de Baillet-Latour and Avery Brundage, were openly anti-semitic and both collaborated with the Nazis. On the contrary, the Workers' Olympiads opposed all kinds of chauvinism, sexism, racism and social exclusiveness. The Olympic Games were based in rivalry between the nations, but the Workers' Olympiads stressed internationalism, friendship, solidarity and peace."
"The Lucerne Sport International (later known as Socialist Workers' Sport International) was established in Lucerne, Switzerland in 1920. The first unofficial Workers' Olympiads were held a year later in Prague, Czechoslovakia. The IOC had banned the losing side of the World War I from the 1920 Summer Olympics (Germany even from the 1924 games), but the Workers's Olympiads were open for the ""enemy"" side as well. The number of participating countries was thirteen. The first official Worker's Olympiads were the 1925 winter games in the German town of Schreiberhau, which today is a part of Poland. They were followed by the first Summer Olympiads in Frankfurt am Main."
"National flags were not used, but a red flag of international workers' movement. The best athletes were awarded with diplomas, they did not receive medals like in the Olympic Games. The visiting athletes stayed mostly at private accommodation of local families."
"International Workers' Olympiads were more than just a games for the top athletes. The festival was based on a mass participation, it did not restrict entry on the grounds of sporting ability. 1931 Workers' Summer Olympiad in Vienna was the largest event with the participation of 100,000 athletes from 26 countries. The Vienna Workers' Olympiad attracted some 250,000 spectators. It was much bigger event than the 1932 Summer Olympics at Los Angeles, both in number of participants as well as spectators. Praterstadion (now Ernst-Happel-Stadion) was constructed between 1929 and 1931 for the 1931 Olympiad. The last Workers' Olympiad at Antwerp in 1937 was a joint event with the Red Sport International organized Spartakiads."

The ship has four holds, 17 hatches and is equipped with a discharge boom that can swing 105 degrees to either side of the ship and discharges 3,810 tonnes per hour."
"The ship was constructed by Collingwood Shipyards at their yard in Collingwood, Ontario with the yard number 189. ""Algorail"" was launched on 13 December 1967, christened on 1 April 1968 and completed that month. The second freighter of the name was registered at Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario for Algoma Central.

"On 6 October 1972, ""Algorail"" allided with the pier at Holland, Michigan loaded with a cargo of salt. The pier tore a hole in her bow, which caused the vessel to sink. The ship was refloated, repaired and put back into service. On 20 April 1999, ""Algorail"" ran aground at Green Bay, Wisconsin in the Fox River. The ship was undamaged, but attempts by two tugboats to free the ship damaged the docks at Green Bay. On 25 June 2013 she ran aground with a shipment of salt in the Saginaw River. Zilwaukee Dock Manager Jim Cnudde cited ""Algorail""s running aground as an indication that greater efforts should be made to keep the river dredged.

"Lambie was known for his eccentricity, cigar smoking and fondness for pigeons. An occasion when he instructed for a concussed player to be told he was Pelé and sent back onto the pitch is one of the most famous quotes in British football."

He led the ""Accies"" to the First Division title in 1985–86 and won away at Rangers in the next season's Scottish Cup."
"In 1988, Lambie was appointed manager for the first time at Partick Thistle, but a year later returned to Hamilton, before going back to Partick in 1990. He led the ""Jags"" to promotion to the top flight in 1992 and left in 1995 for his former club Falkirk, but quit his post in March 1996. ""The Herald"" wrote in 2002 that ""It is odd how, despite Lambie playing over 200 games for Falkirk, and scoring a decent haul of goals as a defender, he is only remembered for his disastrous managerial reign""."
"Lambie returned for a third spell at Partick in 1999, with the club now in the third tier, and got them into the Scottish Premier League in 2002 via back-to-back promotions. Also in 2002, he guided the club to the Cup semi-finals, where they lost 3–0 to Rangers at Hampden Park. The final stages of the season were chronicled in the BBC Scotland fly on the wall documentary ""Grasping the Thistle"", known for Lambie's use of profanity."
"In January 2003, Lambie announced that he would retire at the end of the season as he did not agree with new regulations in football; he had attempted to sign Nathan Lowndes and Steven Ferguson on loan from English clubs but was barred by FIFA as they had both recently played in Scotland for other teams. On 17 May 2003 he made his farewell in his last game at Firhill Stadium, a 1–0 loss to Dundee United, having already guaranteed survival in the SPL on a considerably lower budget than their competitors. He became a member of the club's board and had a brief fourth spell as manager from December 2004."
"Lambie is remembered for his reaction when Partick player Colin McGlashan suffered a concussion; he ordered his assistant Gerry Collins to ""Tell him he's Pelé and get him back on"". A book of football quotes titled ""Tell Him He's Pelé"" was released in 2010. He is also remembered for taming Chic Charnley, a player sent off 17 times in his career, whom he signed once for Hamilton and three times for Partick."
Lambie was known for his love of pigeon racing and cigars. He spoke of the importance of his Christian faith in his life. He was a member and activist for the Scottish National Party but said that he was not a suitable candidate to seek elected office.
He was awarded the position of Honorary Vice President of Partick Thistle F.C. in August 2006. He was inducted into the Halls of Fame at both Falkirk and Partick Thistle.
"Lambie had three daughters with his wife Mamie, from whom he was separated at the time of his death at the age of 77 on 10 April 2018."
= = = Psyclon Nine = = =
"Psyclon Nine is an American band formed in 2000 in San Francisco, CA, known for their unique blend of electronic, industrial metal and black metal. Originally, Psyclon Nine's music was aggrotech. However, the band has since evolved a more industrial/black metal sound."
"Psyclon Nine's main music contributor is lead vocalist, lyricist, multi-instrumentalist, and producer Nero Bellum, who is the only remaining original member. In 2009, Psyclon Nine's fourth album We the Fallen was the band's first and only album to chart on the Billboard Charts."
"Psyclon Nine began in 1999 when roommates, Marshall Goppert and Josef Heresy created an industrial metal music project called ""Defkon Sodomy"", influenced by bands like KMFDM and Ministry. The band only performed under that name twice before changing it to Psyclon Nine. The name was a malapropism of Zyklon B, the trade name of hydrogen cyanide used in the gas chambers during the Holocaust. The “Nine” was used because of the number's significance in Aleister Crowley’s numerological writings. Around this time, Marshall and Josef took on their stage names as Josef Heresy, and Nero Bellum. Nero's name was taken from the Roman Emperor Nero Caesar, and Bellum is Latin for war."
"Bellum met with European NoiTekk record label executive Marco Gruhn at a San Francisco Grendel show, and persuaded him to sign Psyclon Nine. The band's first album Divine Infekt was recorded shortly thereafter, produced and engineered by Da5id Din of Informatik. The title track was remixed by Tactical Sekt and the album was released on September 15th, 2003."
"Psyclon Nine toured lightly on the west coast in the United States and in Europe. They supported acts such as Dismantled, Nocturne, and Martin Atkins."
"Bellum later said in an interview for Vampirefreaks about the Divine Infect remix, ""Tactical Sekt's remix left a bad taste in my mouth"", and attributed that to Anthony Mathers of Tactical Sekt in which his philosophical beliefs made him not want to collaborate with anyone outside of Psyclon Nine again."
"In 2004, Psyclon Nine signed with the American industrial record label Metropolis and returned to Da5id Din's studio for mixing. INRI was released on April 26, 2005 on both Metropolis and NoiTekk Records. The album featured thirteen tracks of dark, aggressive electro focused on religious themes. The album also featured a cover of the Ministry song “You Know What You Are.”"
"In 2005, Nero Bellum met Rotny Ford of the industrial metal band Nocturne on the social networking site LiveJournal. The two discussed musical ideas which led to the band using guitars and drums in their live performances. Ford joined the band on keyboard and guitar."
"Psyclon Nine made several major live appearances following the album's release, including several dates opening for Mindless Self Indulgence. The tour gained the band a fan base. Psyclon Nine returned to Europe for another tour that included a spot on the world's largest Gothic festival, Wave-Gotik-Treffen. It was around this time when drummer Abby Nex, who was also from Nocturne, joined the band as a live drummer."
"At the end of 2005, the band had dropped from their European label NoiTekk and Eric Gottesman quit the band. Gottesman was replaced by members of the industrial rock band Columbine: keyboardist VII and bassist Daniel Columbine."
"With the release of Crwn Thy Frnicatr in 2006, Psyclon Nine began to stray from their early aggrotech sound into a darker black metal / industrial metal approach."
"In late 2006, the band was featured on the cover of the German Gothic magazine Orkus."
"Psyclon Nine went on their first headlining US tour, which eventually led to creative differences between the band and Columbine bassist Daniel. Daniel decided to leave the band at the end of the tour. Abbey Nex replaced him on bass, and Mushroomhead drummer Daniel Fox was used as a live fill-in drummer."
"In early 2007, the band opened for Mushroomhead's 'Savor Sorrow' North American tour which gained the band huge attention among the underground extreme metal / industrial dance scene."
"In May 2007, Psyclon Nine did a European tour that included a spot again at Wave Gotik Treffen. After the European tour, Rotny Ford decided to leave the band for personal reasons."
"In October, the band opened for Mushroomhead again on their second North American tour with Josef on guitar and keys, Abbey on bass, VII on synth, and Daniel on drums."
"In early 2008, the band released its first music video of the fan favorite track 'Parasitic' directed by Mushroomhead's Richard Thomas."
"After the tour with Mushroomhead, Josef Heresy decided to leave the band to go back to college, and VII left to return to his band Columbine. Daniel Fox continued with Mushroomhead. At this time, Nero Bellum decided to move to Los Angeles, CA to begin writing a new album."
"Nero Bellum appeared on the internet channel NoisescapeTV in 2008 and said that he was in the studio working on an album entitled We the Fallen, and has decided to stray away from the harsh EBM music style and incorporate a more black metal meets dark ambient sound."

Kiszka Educational Service Center in Palatine. It is the second-largest elementary-only school district and 19th-largest in Illinois by student enrollment. It serves all or portions of Palatine, Rolling Meadows, Hoffman Estates, Arlington Heights, Inverness, Schaumburg, and South Barrington."
"The district has one preschool early childhood center, 15 elementary schools, four junior high schools, and one alternative public day school."

"Plum Grove Junior High School was built in 1961 for the cost of $1.1 million; the school was opened in September 1962. It started as a 28,000 square foot, one-story, K-8 school with a partial basement. The school was designed for 380 students at the time. Gene Shull was chosen to be the first principal of the school, a position he held until 1969. It was heated by a main boiler and was ventilated by opening windows and doors. Fresh air was reduced for students and staff when fire codes demanded that doors be kept closed. In 1966, a $1.9 million referendum allowed the building to double in size and add newer classrooms that were equipped with small unit ventilators. The school reopened in the fall of 1968. In 1970, it was made exclusively a junior high school."
"In 1988, the junior high's heating and ventilation systems were upgraded. In 1993, a 6.5 million dollar renovation project at Plum Grove added a second floor, cafeteria, resource center, elevator, office, and student service area. This renovation doubled the school's size, making it 98,000 square feet."
"In June 1993, asbestos contractors started to remove the asbestos insulation and tiling. About 90 students had classes in these rooms; 10 students and teachers complained of odors in them. The district consulted TurnKey Environmental Consultants of Mount Prospect, Illinois, to sample the air for contaminants. In 1993, TurnKey submitted a report stating that the levels of alkanes were 133 times lower than the permissible exposure limit set by the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The floors were sealed again but odor complaints still resumed. Students and teachers were moved out of these rooms and the floors were shot blasted and sealed with latex-epoxy paint."
"In 1994, The Chicago Tribune found that five employees had died from various forms of cancer, primarily breast cancer, between 1982 and 1994, and four current staff members had been diagnosed with cancer, three of which had been working in the building for ten years. In addition to that, teachers, staff, and students complained of bronchitis, colds, flus, asthma, and allergies. Incidents of asthma were so severe for students that some decided to transfer to different schools. The teachers wrote to the school board asking for an investigation. The administration immediately agreed to investigate the concerns. At this time, media coverage was heavy, placing pressure on the school district to take immediate action."
"A team, including Northwest Community Hospital and TurnKey Environmental Consultants were chosen to investigate the concerns. While the investigation by Northwest Community Hospital and Turnkey Environmental was going on (expected to end in late June), the Classroom Teachers Council (CTC), said it would push to conduct its own tests if the district's team found no problems. This statement was largely due to the revelation that yet another Plum Grove teacher had been diagnosed with cancer."
"In late June, the district announced that the results of the much anticipated investigation would be delayed three weeks. The teachers sent a formal request to the district to get the raw data from the environmental samples to conduct their own investigation. Although ties were found between ingesting certain types of common mold aspergillus and cancer, Dr. Peter Orris, a medical director the district hired for the investigation, denied that mold at the school had any link to cancer in a letter sent to teachers. However, teachers and parents were still concerned that Orris was basing his conclusions in part on a British Medical Journal published in 1976. In late August 1994, it was found by the investigation that there were no cancer-causing agents in Plum Grove, but the air quality of the building was very poor."
"On August 6, 1994, an unknown vandal pried open the school's doors and scattered chemicals and specimens in the science lab."
"In 1997, Plum Grove was recognized by the United States Department of Education as a National Blue Ribbon School. The school was also recognized by the Illinois Honor Roll with its Academic Excellence Award from 2007-2012."
"Each year, Plum Grove participates in a fundraiser for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS) called ""Pennies for Patients"". During the fundraiser, organized by Maura Reid, students are encouraged to bring in donations in the form of pennies and other coins; the class with the donation that weighs the most is awarded a prize. Several activities are also held during the fundraiser to support the LLS. The school has participated in the fundraiser since 2002 and has been featured on CBS and in the ""Daily Herald"" for these actions. As of 2015, Plum Grove has raised over $143,000 for the charity."
"Plum Grove is featured in the book ""Code of Silence: Living a Lie Comes With a Price"" by Plum Grove alumnus Tim Shoemaker as the school at which the main characters attend. As a result of the popularity of the book and Shoemaker's success, he visited Plum Grove during the 2014-2015 school year to talk to the students about writing as a career."

He attended the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he played college baseball for the UCLA Bruins baseball team. He was named an All-American and Pac-12 Conference Baseball Pitcher of the Year in 2013. He set a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) record for saves in a single season with 24. The Texas Rangers selected Berg in the 17th round of the 2014 Major League Baseball Draft. He did not sign with the Rangers and returned to UCLA for his senior season. He was then drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the sixth round of the 2015 MLB Draft."
"Berg attended Bishop Amat Memorial High School in La Puente, California, where he played for the school's baseball team as a pitcher. He struggled while attempting to work as a starting pitcher, and in his junior year, his coaches helped him achieve success as a middle relief pitcher when he learned to use the sidearm delivery. He led his school's baseball team to the sectional championship."
"Berg was only recruited by the University of California, Irvine and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Berg enrolled at UCLA, and walked on to the UCLA Bruins baseball team. In 2012, his freshman season, Berg set Bruins and Pac-12 Conference records for appearances while working in middle relief. As a sophomore, Berg became the closer for the 2013 UCLA Bruins, and pitched to a 7–0 win–loss record, 21 saves, and a 0.88 earned run average (ERA) during the regular season. His 21 saves set a Bruins record and his ERA tied for the best in college baseball. He was named the Pac-12 Conference Baseball Pitcher of the Year and a finalist for the National Pitcher of the Year Award in 2013. He won the NCBWA Stopper of the Year Award. was named to the United States national collegiate baseball team in 2012 and 2013."
"With the Bruins, Berg competed in the 2013 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament, leading the team to the College World Series national championship against the Mississippi State Bulldogs. The Bruins had a tournament record of 8–0 heading into the Finals. At the Championship Series, Berg set a new NCAA single-season record with his 24th save on June 24, 2013 and he also made his 51st appearance of the season, becoming the first pitcher in NCAA history to record 50 or more appearances in two seasons. The Bruins defeated the Bulldogs for the national title and Berg was named to the tournament's All-West Region team."
"Berg missed time in his junior year due to a biceps strain. He finished the season with a 1.50 ERA and 11 saves. The Texas Rangers selected Berg in the 17th round, with the 516th overall selection, of the 2014 MLB Draft. He did not sign with the Rangers and returned to UCLA for his senior season."
"On May 15, 2015, James Kaprielian combined with Berg for the first no-hitter in UCLA history. Kaprielian pitched the first nine innings and Berg pitched the tenth inning to complete the no-hitter. He finished the year with a 0.68 ERA and 13 saves in 43 appearances, and won his second Stopper of the Year Award."
= = = L'Opéra du pauvre = = =
"L'Opéra du pauvre (English: Poor's Opera) is a piece for voices and orchestra formalized by Léo Ferré as a quadruple concept album released in 1983. This dreamlike and wry plea in favor of the Night, symbol of imagination and subversiveness for Ferré, synthesizes all aspects of the French poet and musician."
"""L'Opéra du pauvre"" comes from a ""lyrical"" ballet titled ""The Night"", written in 1956 at the request of choreographer and dancer Roland Petit, within the Revue des Ballets de Paris. The piece was abandoned by Petit after a few performances (critics being severely negative). Ferré published the libretto same year at La Table Ronde Editions. This work stayed then on the shelf for twenty-six years."
"It was after the triple LP ""Ludwig - L'Imaginaire - Le Bateau ivre"" was released in 1982, that Léo Ferré decided to dedicate his upcoming year to bring ""The Night"" back to life. As time had passed, Ferré had accumulated a lot of material, and he chose to enrich his original text and score with elements from various sources, thus creating a new Baroque work of much larger scope (it would take four LP to hold this whole new version)."
Léo Ferré changes his voice and acts all parts.
"The Night is accused of having murdered the Lady Shadow, who is missing. The opera depicts Night's trial by the ""day people"", allegorized by animals. The judge is a raven, prosecutor is a cock and Night's attorney is an owl. Witnesses, all night owls for some reason of their own, are called to the bar and try to save the Night."
= = = Lucsuhin Natural Bridge = = =
"Lucsuhin Natural Bridge, locally called Cabag Cave or Lucsuhin Cave, is a natural bridge located between Brgy. Lucsuhin and Brgy. Kalubkob in Silang, Cavite province in the Philippines. The bridge, which crosses the Ylang-Ylang River, is the first large natural bridge reported in the country."
"The first American to discover and study the bridge is Paul R. Fanning from the Division of Mines during the early part of the American colonial period. He was making a geological reconnaissance in the vicinity of Silang, Cavite in July 1910 when he discovered the natural bridge of unusual size. Owing to its remoteness, Fanning believed no white men have probably visited the place before."
The natural bridge is located in the great bedded tuff area lying between Manila and Tayabas Bay where the rock is favorable for their formation.
"The opening under the bridge span is tunnel-like and has a diameter of about and a length of about . It makes a double turn that roughly approximates the shape of the letter 'S.' During low water, the stream occupies a central channel consisting of a staggered series of small falls and potholes which are the result of the action of the water upon the horizontal bedding of the tuff rock."
"The floor of the bridge, which is about above the stream, was examined by Fanning and showed evidence of once having formed the bed of the stream. Erosion had nearly obliterated this old bed, but had not been sufficient to destroy the sides of the valley. At one time, the river must have flowed at this higher elevation to a place several kilometers down stream from the present tunnel and then passed over a cliff. This cliff gradually receded upstream forming the present box canyon. As illustrated by the sketches, seepage began at a point several hundred meters above the falls and, owing to the horizontal bedding of the rock, it first took a path at right angles to the river course, then descended from bed to bed to the bottom of the falls. The porous, soft nature of the rock favored the rapid enlargement of the underground channel, and eventually the entire stream followed this course."
"Subsequent erosion and caving had greatly decreased the length of the underground channel and produced the short canyon above the present entrance portal. Owing to the thinness of the roof, the first part of the tunnel caved rapidly, whereas the erosion and caving of the lower part was much slower. A condition now has been reached where the entrance and exit portals will be eroded with about equal speed and at the same time the tunnel will be greatly enlarged in diameter by down cutting and by caving of the roof. Under these conditions the bridge eventually should assume the arch structure characteristic of famous natural bridges in other parts of the world."
"The bridge and cave is not a protected area and need preservation for future generations, as well as the areas upriver to preserve the quality of water, lest it would end up like Hinulugang Taktak falls in Rizal province."
"The bridge can be reached from Silang by following the Silang-Banaybanay Road for about west from the Aguinaldo Highway and J. Rizal Ave. junction to the barrio of Lucsuhin, past the road to the Riviera Golf & Country Club, past the bridge over Ylang-Ylang River to Brgy. Kalubkob. From here, it is about long hike to the site."
"An alternate route from Kalubkob, is to head north on Fresco Belen Drive for about to a dirt road to the right. The bridge and cave are reached by hiking east on the dirt road for ."

= = = Robert Stephenson and Company = = =
Robert Stephenson and Company was a locomotive manufacturing company founded in 1823. It was the first company set up specifically to build railway engines.
"The company was set up in 1823 in Forth Street, Newcastle-upon-Tyne in England by George Stephenson, his son Robert, with Edward Pease and Thomas Richardson. The manager of the works between 1824 and 1825 was James Kennedy."
"The company's first engine was ""Locomotion No 1"", which opened the Stockton and Darlington, followed by three more: ""Hope"", ""Black Diamond"", and ""Diligence"". Their vertical cylinders meant these locomotives rocked excessively and at the Hetton colliery railway Stephenson had introduced ""steam springs"" which had proved unsatisfactory. In 1828 he introduced the ""Experiment"" with inclined cylinders, which improved stability, and meant that it could be mounted on springs. Originally four wheeled, it was modified for six and another example, ""Victory"", was built. Around this time, two locomotives were built for America. The first, a four coupled loco named ""America"", was ordered by the Delaware and Hudson Railroad. The second, six-coupled and named ""Whistler"", was built for the Boston and Providence Rail Road in 1833."
"In 1829, the company built a new, experimental locomotive to enter in the Rainhill Trials. Rocket had two notable improvements — a multi-tube boiler and a separate firebox. Rocket won the trials and convinced the directors of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway to use steam locomotives on their railway, and to order these locomotives from Robert Stephenson & Co. Rocket's cylinder were originally angled at an angle of 45 degrees, but were later moved to be horizontal."
"The ""Invicta"" was the twentieth Robert Stephenson & Co. locomotive, and was built for the Canterbury and Whitstable Railway. Its cylinders were inclined, but moved to the front end. In 1830 came the ""Planet"" class with the cylinders inside the frames, followed by the ""Patentee"", which added a pair of trailing wheels for greater stability with a larger boiler. This 2-2-2 design became the pattern for most locomotives, by a variety of manufacturers, for many years."
"The locomotive ""John Bull"", built in 1831, was originally of the ""Planet"" type, but was later modified. It survives and is now in the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C., and is claimed to be the oldest still functional self-propelled vehicle."
"The increased distance travelled by many trains highlighted problems with the fireboxes and chimneys. With the co-operation of the North Midland Railway at their Derby works, he measured the temperature of the exhaust gases, and decided to lengthen the boilers on future engines. Initially these ""long-boiler"" engines were 2-2-2 designs, but in 1844, Stephenson moved the trailing wheel to the front in 4-2-0 formation, so that the cylinders could be mounted between the supporting wheels. It was one of these, the ""Great A"" along with another from the North Midland Railway, which was compared with Brunel's ""Ixion"" in the gauge trials in 1846. In 1846 he added a pair of trailing wheels - the first with eight wheels. Another important innovation in 1842 was the Stephenson link motion."
"Robert Stephenson and Company built a number of Crampton type locomotives for the South Eastern Railway and the London, Chatham and Dover Railway. These were all of 4-2-0 wheel arrangement with inside cylinders and indirect drive. The inside cylinders drove a crankshaft located in front of the firebox and the crankshaft was coupled to the driving wheels by outside rods. They were unsuccessful on the LCDR, and the five ""Echo"" class locomotives were rebuilt as conventional 4-4-0 locomotives after only four years of service."
"The first railway proposal in Egypt came about when Pasha Muhammad Ali asked the British engineer T.H. Galloway to design a railway in 1834. Instructions to make it followed in 1836. Materials were delivered but little real construction followed. No Ottoman ""firwan"" (permission) was issued and the French objected. Progress was really made when in 1849 Muhammad Ali died, and in 1851 his grandson Abbas I of Egypt contracted Robert Stephenson to build Egypt's first standard gauge railway. The first section, between Alexandria on the Mediterranean coast and Kafr el-Zayyat on the Rosetta branch of the Nile was opened in 1854. This was the first railway in the Ottoman Empire as well as Africa and the Middle East. In the same year Abbas died and was succeeded by Sa'id Pasha, in whose reign the section between Kafr el-Zayyat and Cairo was completed in 1856 followed by an extension from Cairo to Suez in 1858. This completed the first modern transport link between the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean, as Ferdinand de Lesseps did not complete the Suez Canal until 1869."
"At Kafr el-Zayyat the line between Cairo and Alexandria originally crossed the Nile with an 80 feet (24 m) car float. This was the single largest project of the South Street Works. However, on 15 May 1858 a special train conveying Sa'id's heir presumptive Ahmad Rifaat Pasha fell off the float into the river and the prince was drowned. Stephenson therefore replaced the car float with a swing bridge nearly long."
The Egyptian connections to Robert Stephenson were very considerable and a wealth of consequential artefacts are in Cairo Railway Museum. This includes what could well be the single most extravagant piece built by the Robert Stephenson Works. This is works number 1295 of 1862 whose artistic design was by Matthew Digby Wyatt. This 2-2-4T for the Egyptian Railways survives with all its fantastical marquetry in the Egyptian Railway Museum at Cairo. It is called the Khedive's Train.
"Over the remainder of the century, the company prospered in the face of increasing competition, supplying railways at home and abroad. By 1899 around 3000 locomotives had been built and a new limited liability company was formed, Robert Stephenson and Company Limited and the works was moved to Darlington, the first locomotive leaving the shop in 1902."
"Most railways in Britain were building their own rolling stock, so most of the output was for export, from 4-4-0's for the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway to GS (4-6-0) and HS (2-8-0) classes for the Bengal Nagpur Railway. These preceded the slightly larger BESA standard designs for the Indian railways. The works built the first British 2-10-0 for the Argentine Great Western Railway in 1905."
"During World War I, the company devoted itself to munitions work. However, between 1917 and 1920, a large batch of ROD 2-8-0 and SNCV type 18 0-6-0 tram locomotives were ordered by the War Office for use on the continent. From then on, business was slack, for various reasons. Notable were thirty 2-6-0 mixed traffic locomotives for the GWR in 1921, a batch of thirty 0-6-0 tank engines for the LNER and five 7F 2-8-0s for the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway. In 1936 and 1937, only forty six were built, including eleven B17 class (""Sandringham"") 4-6-0s for the LNER, and seven 2-6-4 passenger tank locomotives for the South Indian Railway Company."
"In 1937, the company merged with the locomotive interests of Hawthorn Leslie and Company to form Robert Stephenson and Hawthorns Limited. The company's shipbuilding activities continuing separately. Main line locomotives continued to be built at Darlington, while industrial engines were built at Hawthorne Leslie's works at Forth Bank, Newcastle. in 1938 the goodwill of the Kitson and Manning Wardle companies was bought."

"Halo: Spartan Assault is a 2013 twin stick shooter video game developed by 343 Industries and Vanguard Games. Part of the ""Halo"" media franchise, it was released on July 18, 2013, for Microsoft's Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 platforms. The game subsequently released on Xbox One, Xbox 360, Steam and iOS."
"""Halo: Spartan Assault"" is set between the events of ""Halo 3"" and ""Halo 4"". Players control the human soldiers Sarah Palmer and Edward Davis as they fight a splinter faction of the alien Covenant. The game launched with 25 single-player missions, with an additional campaign released as downloadable content. The console versions feature an exclusive cooperative horde mode."
"After years of rumored or cancelled handheld ""Halo"" projects, ""Spartan Assault"" was the franchise's first mobile game. The developers spent time adapting ""Halo""s distinctive elements to a touchscreen game meant to be played in short bursts. The game received mixed reviews on release, with the game praised for its success at pinpointing ""Halo""s aesthetic; the mobile versions of the game received lower average scores. ""Spartan Assault"" was followed by a sequel, """", in 2015."
"""Halo: Spartan Assault"" is a shooter game where players view gameplay from an overhead top-down perspective. The control method for the game depends on the host device. On touchscreen mobile devices, players control the character through virtual joysticks—the left stick controls movement and the right stick controls the direction of the character's fire—along with buttons along the edge of the screen. Xbox 360 and Xbox One players use a physical gamepad, while Windows players can use either a gamepad, or keyboard and mouse."
"The game features classic weapons and vehicles from the franchise. To assist players, many weapons auto-target enemies in the direction the player is firing."
"Gameplay of ""Halo: Spartan Assault"" earns the player experience points (XP), Achievements, and emblems for a ""Halo 4"" Spartan career."
"The Xbox 360 and the Xbox One versions of the game feature an additional cooperative game mode, designed to be different from that of the main campaign. Two players team up to survive against waves of enemy Flood."
"""Halo: Spartan Assault"" takes place in the 26th century between the events of ""Halo 3"" and ""Halo 4"". Following the events of ""Halo 3"", the human UNSC and alien Covenant separatists signed a ceasefire to end a decades-long war. Gameplay follows through the perspective of the Spartan supersoldiers Sarah Palmer or Spartan Davis. The campaign is divided into chapters, then further subdivided into individual missions."
"Spartans Palmer and Davis are stationed on the planet Draetheus V when it comes under attack from a rogue group of Covenant who have ignored the ceasefire. Palmer and Davis work to repel the invaders. This new Covenant leadership discovers that Draetheus' moon is actually a weapon built by an ancient race known as the Forerunners. The Covenant activates the weapon, tearing apart Draetheus and triggering an evacuation. Spartan Davis gives his life to allow the remaining human forces enough time to escape. Spartan Palmer tracks down the Covenant leader Merg Vol, kills him, sabotages the Forerunner weapon, and escapes the moon."
"In the Operation Hydra campaign, Spartan Palmer returns to X50 in search of a mysterious signal. She discovers that the signal is actually a distress signal from Spartan Davis. Palmer reaches the core of X50, but finds Davis dead; the moon is using his remains to create an unknown device, which Palmer extracts for study."
"Over the years, rumors swirled of a handheld or mobile version of ""Halo"" for the Game Boy Advance, Gizmondo, Ultra-Mobile PC, and Nintendo DS. Then-""Halo"" developer Bungie quashed speculation they were developing an Xbox Live Arcade title in 2006. When ""Halo"" overseer 343 Industries was interested in developing a mobile game, Franchise Development Director Frank O'Connor recommended an arcade shooter, having wanted for years to see a ""Halo"" game in the vein of ""Moon Patrol""."
"343 Industries Executive Producer Dan Ayoub described the challenge of adapting ""Halo"" for a portable device as crafting the right experience for the device. ""If we'd gone down the first-person shooter route, we might have built something compelling, but it couldn't on its own merit play as well as a traditional ""Halo"" game,"" O'Connor recalled. While focusing on optimizing the game for touch controls, the developers wanted to make sure the elements that made ""Halo"" distinctive—its weapon sandbox, abilities, and look—remained. The focus on a mobile game experience also meant that the developers broke up the game's missions into smaller chunks for short playthroughs. During development, the game was known by the codename ""Bootcamp""."
"Tom Salta composed ""Spartan Assault""s music. The game was the first time Salta had worked on a project where the sound had been established by another composer—Salta called the original music of Combat Evolved ""sacred ground for me"" and his inspiration to compose for video games. Previous to ""Spartan Assault"" Salta was part of the team that reorchestrated and recorded the music for """"."
"Because the game was designed to be played on mobile devices, Salta and the music team worked to make sure audio quality would be high on small mobile speakers as well as through headphones or higher-end hardware. Since there was a limited budget for the music, Salta chose which sounds and instruments he would record live. Salta starts composing on a keyboard and uses Logic."
"""Spartan Assault"" was released in North America and Europe on July 18 and 19, respectively. In the United States, the game was initially restricted to Verizon phones before being released to all Windows 8 enabled devices. An Xbox One version of the game released on December 24, 2013, followed by an Xbox 360 version on January 31, 2014. It was released on Steam on April 4, 2014, the first game in the series to be distributed on the platform. On April 16, 2015, the game was released for iOS.

By his retirement, the evangelical Pentecostal denomination had grown from 29,000 members in 410 churches to 1.2 million members in more than 19,000 churches located in 63 countries."
"Rolf McPherson was born on March 23, 1913 in Providence, Rhode Island. He was the son of Harold Stewart McPherson and Aimee Semple McPherson, founder of the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel. He was the half-brother of Roberta Star Semple, the daughter of Aimee and her first husband Robert James Semple, who had died of malaria one month before the birth of his daughter. Rolf and his sister Roberta were part of many services and revivals when young. McPherson attended college, first studying engineering. He switched to religion in 1930 after his mother became ill, and also completed divinity school, earning a doctorate."
"McPherson began his career as a preacher. His mother groomed him to take over Foursquare after a management dispute resulted in Roberta being ousted from church leadership. After his mother's death in 1944, and for the next 44 years, McPherson led the denomination, headquartered at Angelus Temple, and brought it into the evangelical mainstream, which supported its tremendous development in the United States and expansion internationally."

= = = 1891 Atlantic hurricane season = = =
"The 1891 Atlantic hurricane season ran through the summer and the early winter of 1891. The season had ten tropical cyclones, seven of which became hurricanes including one which became a major Category 3 hurricane. However, in the absence of modern satellite and other remote-sensing technologies, only cyclones that affected populated land areas or encountered ships at sea are currently known, so the actual total could be higher. An undercount bias of zero to four tropical cyclones per year between 1886 and 1910 has been estimated. The tracks of four of the ten known 1891 Atlantic cyclones were revised in 1996 by Jose Fernandez-Partagas. Following re-analysis in 2003, two storms previously considered distinct are now regarded as a single system, Tropical Storm 8. A number of other storms from 1891 were considered for inclusion in the Atlantic hurrice database, HURDAT, but are currently excluded due to a lack of evidence of tropical storm intensity."
"A tropical storm formed in Gulf of Mexico northwest of Campeche on July 3. By the evening of July 6 it was approaching the coastline of Texas and had become a Category 1 hurricane. It made landfall just west of Galveston and quickly weakened to a tropical storm. It dissipated near the Alabama-Tennessee state line two days later after further weakening to a tropical depression. Sections of Galveston were flooded by a storm surge. At Baton Rouge, tornados related to the hurricane demolished a hundred homes and caused two floors of the state penitentiary to collapse killing ten prisoners."
"A tropical storm formed south of the Cape Verde Islands on August 17 and travelled on a northwesterly path before dissipating in the Atlantic Ocean on August 29 without making a landfall. For the majority of this period it is believed to have been a minimal Category 1 hurricane based on readings taken at Bermuda, which it passed on August 27, the capsizing of a steamer, the ""Dunsmurry"" on August 29 and observations from another ship, ""La Touraine"", which ran into the rough seas left in the hurricane's wake on August 30 and 31st."
The Martinique Hurricane of 1891 or Hurricane San Magín of 1891
"A Category 2 hurricane with winds of was first seen at mid-day on August 18 about east of Barbados. The hurricane tracked northwestward at , and grew to a major Category 3 hurricane. That night, the hurricane passed over Martinique, lashing the island for four hours. The hurricane killed more than 700 people alone in Martinique. After reaching its peak intensity with winds of and a minimum central pressure of 961 mb, the storm began to weaken, becoming a Category 2 storm early on August 20. That evening it passed to the south of Puerto Rico. Sustained winds were measured at 100-105 mph. As it began to turn northward, it made landfall on the extreme eastern edge of the Dominican Republic with winds of . Around midnight on August 21, the cyclone passed north of Grand Turk. During the late afternoon and into the evening hours there, frequent rain squalls occurred, and at 10:15 pm a strong gust of wind was reported. After that gust, the winds decreased in intensity, until around midnight when winds picked up from the west. By 8:00 am the next morning, the wind was blowing southerly, and steady rain was falling on the island."
"The hurricane continued to weaken whilst traveling northeastward through the Bahamas on August 22. The center of the storm passed directly over Crooked Island, Bahamas. From August 23, a ridge of high pressure situated off the southeast coast of the United States prevented the, now Category 1, storm recurving to the north. Instead, it passed over the Florida Peninsula as a tropical storm, making landfall near Homestead on August 24. Subsequently, it moved into the Gulf of Mexico, where it dissipated on August 25."
"On Martinique, the storm destroyed houses, crops and trees across the entire island. Fifty boats in harbours around Martinque were damaged or destroyed. At Ducos, only four homes remained following the storm, and at St. Pierre, at least 34 people lost their lives. At Fort de France, twenty people were killed. A military camp at Balata was destroyed, with a number of soldiers there sustaining injuries from airborne debris. In total, the death toll from this hurricane was put at 700. In South Florida, the cyclone also produced hurricane-force winds that blew boats ashore near present-day Cutler."
On September 2 a tropical storm formed northeast of the Leeward Islands. It began moving northwestward and reached category 2 hurricane strength by September 4. By September 7 the cyclone was off the coast of New England and was bringing heavy rain to that area. When the hurricane made landfall in Nova Scotia and then Newfoundland on September 8 it destroyed a number of small vessels but then quickly weakened and dissipated north of Newfoundland in the Labrador Sea on September 10.
"A tropical storm formed in the open Atlantic near 19°N 47°W on September 16, before developing into a Category 2 hurricane on September 20. This hurricane never made landfall but did pass within 100 km of Bermuda on the night of September 21. A ship was reported wrecked on the coast of the island that night. The hurricane became an extratropical storm on September 26 in the mid-Atlantic off Nova Scotia."
"A tropical storm formed in the open Atlantic near 21°N 54°W on September 29. It moved northwestward becoming first a Category 1 hurricane then, October 3 a Category 2 hurricane. At this strength it passed to the south, then to the west, of Bermuda on October 4. It quickly weakened as it continued heading north and was already an extratropical storm when it made landfall in Nova Scotia on October 6. It also affected Newfoundland before dissipating in the Labrador Sea on October 8."
A moderate tropical storm formed in the Caribbean Sea south of Jamaica on October 4 and passed to the west of both Jamaica and the Cayman Islands before striking the Isla de la Juventud and Cuba on October 6. The next day it passed across southern Florida before travelling northeastward off the east coast of the United States and then decaying in the open Atlantic on October 8. Some vessels were driven ashore on the coast of Cuba and two people drowned in flooding on the island.
"A tropical depression formed north of Honduras on October 7 and strengthened into a tropical storm the next day. On October 9 it passed across Cuba and quickly weakened to become an extratropical storm. As an extratropical storm it made landfalls in Florida on October 10 and, five days later, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland where it dissipated."
"A tropical storm formed north of Grenada on October 12, and made landfalls on Saint Croix and the main Virgin Islands on October 14.The system strengthened to a Category 1 hurricane as it proceeded north. The storm centre passed west of Bermuda on October 18 at that strength but weakened to a tropical storm just before affecting the southern tip of Newfoundland on October 20."
"On November 3 a tropical storm formed northeast of present-day Nassau, Bahamas. It treked north, passing east of Bermuda on November 5. The storm never made a landfall before dissipating in the open Atlantic off Nova Scotia on November 6."

"Vladimir Monomakh () was an armoured cruiser built for the Imperial Russian Navy during the 1880s. The vessel was named after Vladimir II Monomakh, Grand Prince of Kiev. She spent most of her career in the Far East, although the ship was in the Baltic Sea when the Russo-Japanese War began in 1904. ""Vladimir Monomakh"" was assigned to the Third Pacific Squadron and participated in the Battle of Tsushima in May 1905. She was tasked to protect the Russian transports and was not heavily engaged during the daylight portion of the battle. The ship was torpedoed during the night and was scuttled the following morning by her captain to prevent her capture by the Japanese."
"""Vladimir Monomakh"" was classified as a semi-armored frigate and was an improved version of the preceding . The ship was designed with high endurance and high speed to facilitate her role as a commerce raider able to outrun enemy battleships. She was laid out as a central battery ironclad with the armament concentrated amidships. The iron-hulled ship was fitted with a ram and was sheathed in wood and copper to reduce fouling. The ship's hull was subdivided by ten transverse bulkheads and she had a double bottom deep. Her crew numbered approximately 550 officers and men. ""Vladimir Monomakh"" was long overall. She had a beam of and a draft of . The ship displaced at deep load."
"The ship had two vertical compound steam engines, each driving a four-bladed, manganese-bronze propeller. Steam was provided by six cylindrical boilers at a pressure of . The engines produced during sea trials which gave the ship a maximum speed around . ""Vladimir Monomakh"" carried of coal which gave her an economical range of at a speed of . She was ship rigged with three masts and had a total sail area of . To reduce drag while under sail, her funnels were retractable."
"""Vladimir Monomakh"" was armed with four guns, one at each corner of the battery that were sponsoned out over the sides of the hull. Eight of the dozen guns were mounted between the eight-inch guns in the central battery and the remaining four were outside the battery at the ends of the ship. Anti-torpedo boat defence was provided by four 9-pounder and ten Hotchkiss guns. The ship was also equipped with three above-water torpedo tubes."
"The ship's waterline belt was composed of compound armour and extended the full length of the ship. It was six inches thick amidships, but reduced to at the ship's ends. It extended above the waterline and below. Transverse bulkheads thick protected the guns in the battery from raking fire. The sponsons of the 8-inch guns were equally thick. The protective deck was thick."
"Construction began on ""Vladimir Monomakh"" on 22 February 1881 at the Baltic Shipyard in St. Petersburg, although the formal keel-laying ceremony was not held until 21 May. She was launched on 22 October 1882 and completed on 13 July 1883. The ship's total cost was 3,348,847 rubles. Although the second vessel to be laid down in the ""Dmitri Donskoy"" class, ""Vladimir Monomakh"" was completed first. Due to constant changes during construction, the design of both vessels diverged considerably by the time of completion. The ship was named after Vladimir II Monomakh, Grand Prince of Kiev."
"On 11 October 1884, ""Vladimir Monomakh"" began a leisurely voyage from the Baltic Sea to the Far East. She made port visits in Kristiansand, Norway and Portland Harbour, England before reaching Malta on 25 November. The ship spent most of the next six weeks in Greek waters before arriving at Port Said, Egypt on 12 January 1885 to transit the Suez Canal. ""Vladimir Monomakh"" encountered the British ironclad battleship there and was followed by her all the way to Japan as tensions were rising between Great Britain and Russia in early 1885. The ship arrived in Nagasaki in March 1885 and was appointed flagship of the Russian Pacific Fleet under Rear Admiral A.E. Kroun. Based out of Vladivostok, she normally wintered in warmer waters. For example, ""Vladimir Monomakh"" visited Manila, Singapore, Hong Kong, Batavia, Dutch East Indies and Penang Island between November 1885 and March 1886. She returned to Kronstadt in 1887 and was refitted in 1888."
"""Vladimir Monomakh"" departed Kronstadt for the Mediterranean on 6 November 1889 where she remained for the next year. She joined the official escort for the Tsarevich Nicholas II’s visit to the Far East. The Tsarevich travelled aboard the and ""Vladimir Monomakh"" provided protection. The two ships reached Singapore on 2 March 1891, and reached Vladivostok on 23 May. Once at Vladivostok, Captain Oskar Stark was appointed commander of the ship and ""Vladimir Monomakh"" was overhauled through August. She wintered over again at Nagasaki, departing for Europe on 23 April 1892 and reached Kronstadt in August, where the ship was given a thorough refit beginning on 22 September. The heavy sailing rig was replaced by three signal masts, her funnels were fixed in place, and her boilers were also upgraded. ""Vladimir Monomakh"" was reclassified as a 1st Class Cruiser on 13 February 1892."
"On 2 October 1894 the ship, now under the command of Captain Zinovy Rozhestvensky, was ordered back to the Mediterranean. In view of the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95, the Council of Ministers ordered on 1 February 1895 that the Mediterranean Squadron reinforce the 2nd Pacific Squadron. She reached the Chinese treaty port of Chefoo on 16 April and became the flagship of Rear Admiral Yevgeni Ivanovich Alekseyev, 2nd in command of the Pacific Fleet, on 13 May. ""Vladimir Monomakh"" remained at Chefoo until late in the year before sailing to Vladivostok and then to Kobe, Japan in January 1896."
The ship only remained there for a short time before she was ordered back to Kronstadt for a major modernization. Her obsolete 8-inch and 6-inch guns were replaced with five new 45-calibre 6-inch and six Canet guns. The ship's six original boilers were replaced by a dozen cylindrical boilers.
"""Vladimir Monomakh"" was transferred back to the Pacific Fleet in November 1897 and reached Nagasaki in February 1898. After the Triple Intervention expelled the Japanese from Port Arthur, ""Vladimir Monomakh"" was part of the Russian force which subsequently occupied that strategic harbor. In June 1900, she transported troops involved in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion. In September 1900, on her return to Port Arthur, she accidentally rammed and sank the merchant vessel ""Crown of Aragon"". In December 1901, she rendezvoused with ""Dmitri Donskoy"" at Hong Kong, and the two ships returned to the Mediterranean via the Suez Canal. ""Vladimir Monomakh"" remained in the Mediterranean until August 1902, and reached Kronstadt in October. In 1903–04 some of her Hotchkiss guns were replaced by ."
"In February 1905, ""Vladimir Monomakh"" was assigned to the Third Pacific Squadron, which was sent to reinforce Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky's Second Pacific Squadron. The Third Pacific Squadron transited the Suez Canal and joined the 2nd Pacific Squadron at Cam Ranh Bay in French Indochina on 14 May 1905 where they was assigned to the Cruiser Division commanded by Rear Admiral Oskar Enkvist."
"At the decisive Battle of Tsushima on 27 May 1905, ""Vladimir Monomakh"" was positioned to the right side of the Russian line of battle, guarding the transports and so avoided the pounding that the other vessels of Second Pacific Squadron received, although she engaged the Japanese cruiser . The Japanese ship was hit several times and driven off, but only three crewmen were killed and seven wounded. ""Vladimir Monomakh"" was hit several times itself and had one 120 mm gun destroyed and its crew killed. The most dangerous hit was a shell that burst over a 6-inch shell hoist and started an ammunition fire. The prompt flooding of the magazine averted an explosion."
"At nightfall, the Japanese torpedo boats engaged the surviving Russian warships and the cruiser claimed to have sunk one of her attackers at 8:25 p.m. ""Vladimir Monomakh"", mistaking one of her attackers for a Russian destroyer, was hit around 8:40 by a single torpedo which ruptured her hull near the No. 2 coal bunker, but sank the torpedo boat. The damage was severe but her crew kept her afloat and her engines operational, although she continued to take on water. The next morning, however, ""Vladimir Monomakh"" headed towards Tsushima Island and began to unload her wounded into her surviving boats. Captain Vladimir Aleksandrovich Popov gave the order to abandon ship, and ordered the seacocks to be opened to scuttle the vessel rather than surrender it to the Japanese. The ship sank at 10:20 a.m. and the crew was captured by the Japanese auxiliary cruisers and . ""Vladimir Monomakh"" was officially removed from the navy list on 28 September 1905."

"In 1964 van Gasteren decided to film all his movements, both outward and inner. He narrates early in the film, ""I wanted to make a film about my memories, my observations and experiences. As a filmmaker, I can make that visible."" Explaining his idea to his wife in the film, he says, ""I want to show everything, because every observation I make fits in with that. Look Jacq, every step I take (he takes a deliberate step forward in the room) – also inwards (points to his chest) – everything I am involved in (gestures at the objects in the room)."""
"The film crisscrosses the globe. Countries the film is shot in include the Netherlands, Switzerland, England, Yugoslavia, France, Canada, West Germany, the United States, India, and Spain. The film mixes documentary with enacted scenes, and is shot in both color and black-and-white."
"The film winds up being a journey of a man in search of truth, seeking to shed lies and illusions, as well as reconcile his relationships with human beings."
"As the film opens, a ninety-year-old Louis van Gasteren—a documentary filmmaker and artist famed in the Netherlands—is seated in a video editing suite, watching scenes of himself in the 1960s, a time when ""anything was possible."" He reflects on how much he has changed, and that he is that same person and yet is not."
"We then go back to 1964. Van Gasteren is touring a carnival with his second wife, Jacqueline, their baby girl Mardou, and two older children from his first marriage. The family rides the carousel and sees the sights, including a ""Fat Lady"" exhibit of a mother and daughter weighing 900 pounds."
"From there Louis begins to recall his own youthful memories. His father, Louis van Gasteren, Sr., was a famous actor, and his mother, Elise Menagé Challa, was a singer who gave up the concert stage to promote Communism and traveled rural Spain to learn the songs of the peasants. We learn that his mother died by suicide a few months after his father’s death, and thoughts of his parents are with him every day."
"The film takes a turn of style as Van Gasteren begins to act, playing himself as a good-timer who cheats on his wife with casual encounters. In the course of his travels he runs into an Italian journalist in Belgrade. The two decide to book a flight to Zagreb on a lark, but are told by the travel agent, ""Nema aviona za Zagreb"" (""There is no plane to Zagreb"" in Serbian). Not knowing the language, they find the expression hilarious, and repeat it wherever they go. But later, when alone, the expression begins to haunt Louis. It becomes a personal catchphrase. ""What ""Nema"" expresses is good will and a great incapacity. ""Nema"" and life as such cannot be tied down. You are in them, yet always off the mark."" What this means is never entirely clear, but what we see is that from this point forward Louis becomes a sincere seeker of truth."
"He begins to be more critical of his assumptions about life and what he was told in his youth, and conducts a series of experiments to test them. Next he questions what he really sees, how many different angles and dimensions man can perceive, and whether life is simply one big illusion. To answer these questions, he experiments with LSD, which at that time was permitted for therapeutic use."
"Shortly afterward, it is reported that a young American has died from jumping out a window while tripping on LSD, apparently believing he could fly like a bird. Troubled by this, Louis travels to a U.S. military base in Germany to talk to the boy’s parents, as well as to Millbrook, New York, to meet the LSD-advocate Timothy Leary. In the two skillfully interwoven interviews, a flower-bedecked Leary boasts that people come to his estate to find God through LSD, while the grieving parents puzzle over what went wrong with their son, who had been so healthy and virtuous. These conversations only leave Louis with more questions. He then goes to India to question the spiritual master Meher Baba about LSD and the search for God."
"First asserting that his own experience of God is continuous, Meher Baba explains that the upliftment produced by drugs is only temporary and thus not a true realization of Divinity; in the end, drugs lead only to madness, delusion, and hypocrisy. After one more disillusioning scene in Millbrook, Louis closes the door on drugs. He tells us that he stopped using LSD after it became illegal, but adds that had it not been for LSD, he would surely have taken his own life, just as his mother and grandfather did."
"From the time of these encounters, the style and pace of the film quicken. Interspersed with shots of his enchanting baby daughter as she takes her first steps and grows into childhood, Van Gasteren turns his attention to his art, to meeting artists, intellectuals, and scientists of the ’60s in the United States and Canada, and puts on several exhibits of his own photography and sculpture. He purchases an Opel automobile and has it crushed, then mounted in an Amsterdam park, elevated to an art form. Marshall McLuhan introduces an exhibition of New Style painting in Toronto, broadcast on television. Louis talks to jazz composer Mal Waldron about how his music expresses his protest against the lack of communication in our world. And to the accompaniment of live jazz and slides of his art, Louis recites his own Beat poetry in English."
"At last Louis travels to the Spanish seaside and seems to resolve the loss of his mother by rescuing a man-sized living turtle being sold at market. Together with his children, Louis rows the gasping turtle out into the harbor and releases it back into the sea, to the joy of the whole family. The camera shifts to a café in which a flamenco singer improvises for the family a touching tribute to Mardou, ""a little angel of God."""
"At the end of the film we see Louis drive down a road and reach a dead end where a mountain of rubble has collapsed into the road. He steps out of the car in silence and faces the mountainous obstacle. It seems to symbolize that he had come to a halting place in the film’s story, or a terminus in that phase of his life. In 1969 Louis stopped making the film."
"In his editing room at ninety years old, Louis van Gasteren at last reveals the heart-breaking event that blocked him from completing the film in the ensuing decades. But now, he says, after more than forty years, he finally found the courage to do it. With this we see him jump from an airplane and descend to earth with a parachute."
"The credits roll over a shot of Louis in the 1960s gazing out the window of a train, where he first began to ponder the word ""nema,"" as ""Really and Sincerely"" by the Bee Gees plays."
"He has worked for the Victoria and Albert Museum as Director of Development from 2002–2005, as a consultant to the Royal National Institute for Deaf People from 2005-6, and the National Museums of Scotland. He also established the University of Ulster's first Development Office in Belfast in 1993 and has worked for Guinness plc (""now Diageo"") as PR and as a director in Belfast of ABSA (now Arts and Business). His client list has included the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales, Edinburgh College of Art, the Vatican Museums (of which he is a UK trustee), The Rosslyn Chapel, Worth Abbey and the World Monuments Fund (GB)amongst others. The Irish Episcopal Conference retained McCaffrey as their fundraising advisor for the International Eucharistic Congress which took place in Dublin in 2012. In 2010, he was the principal fundraising advisor for the Papal visit to the United Kingdom in September 2010. £6.5 million was raised towards the cost of the Papal Visit in 7 months."
"While working for Cambridge University, he played a major part in securing the UK's largest ever charitable gift, $230M given by the Gates Foundation to Cambridge University in 1999. He was involved in the first visit to Northern Ireland by President Bill Clinton and subsequent visits by Hillary Rodham Clinton, and helped to organise the second Millennium Lecture in the White House by Professor Stephen Hawking, hosted by the Clintons."
"In May 2006, Pope Benedict XVI recognised his service to the Roman Catholic Church by bestowing the Order of St. Gregory the Great on McCaffrey, with the title Knight Commander. He first met the then Cardinal Ratzinger while a student at Cambridge in 1988, interviewing the future Pope for the student paper 'Varsity'. The interview also appeared in The Irish Times and The Universe. In 2005, McCaffrey was a commentator for Sky during the period spanning the death and funeral of Pope John Paul II and the election of Pope Benedict XVI. In May 2019 Pope Francis bestowed a promotion on McCaffrey to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Gregory, the highest rank given to a layperson, carrying with it the title 'Excellency'. He is a writer and photographer as well as a donor to various charitable causes, including the work of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem, The Terrence Higgins Trust and Bethlehem University."

= = = Full Circle (Stargate SG-1) = = =
"""Full Circle"" is the season finale for season six of the Canadian-American military science fiction television series ""Stargate SG-1"". It was originally intended to be the last episode of ""Stargate SG-1"".The episode was written by executive producer Robert C. Cooper and directed by Martin Wood. The episodes received an average Nielsen household rating and a low syndication rating compared to other season six episodes. The episode got strong reviews from major media publishers worldwide."
"""Full Circle"" follows the Ascended Daniel Jackson contacting Jack O'Neill and tells him that Anubis has located The Eye of Ra, an enormously powerful weapon that can defeat the combined forces of the Goa'uld System Lords. SG-1 then travels to Abydos to create a defensive position against the Goa'uld Army, Anubis then appears over the planet and threatens to destroy it if they don't give him The Eye of Ra."
"On Abydos, Skaara speaks with the Abydonian elders about Anubis, who will attack soon. In the middle of their council, Daniel appears, telling them that they will not fight alone. At the SGC, Col. O'Neill steps on an elevator, which malfunctions in the middle of the ride. Just as he tries to use the emergency phone, Daniel appears behind him and updates him on the situation with Anubis, who plans to get the ""Eye of Ra"" from Abydos, a key (along with five others) to using a super weapon. Jack demands to know why Daniel, with all the powers of the Ascended, can't stop Anubis himself, and Daniel tries to explain again what he is and is not allowed to do."
"Jack relays Daniel's intel to General Hammond and SG-1. When they ask where he got that kind of information, he reluctantly admits to seeing Daniel, and that it isn't the first time. No one seems terribly surprised to hear it, and Teal'c mentions that he, too, has seen Daniel. Hammond approves the mission, and SG-1 goes to Abydos where they meet up with Skaara, who brings them into an underground chamber, where they hope to find the Eye. While Sam and Jonas explore the chamber, Jack asks Skaara if he's seeing anyone, and Skaara tells him that he's betrothed. In the meantime, Anubis' mothership appears out of hyperspace and several ships fly to the pyramid, which is defended by Teal'c and a number of Abydonians. When the ships and ground troops attack, Teal'c radios Jack, who, irked by Daniel's absence, starts yelling for Daniel. Daniel appears and tries to say he still can't help, but Jack pushes him. Giving in, Daniel agrees to help Sam and Jonas figure out how to find the chamber while Jack and Ska'ara go above to assist Teal'c. Daniel, Major Carter, and Jonas open the chamber, full of artifacts, but not the Eye. In the pyramid, Skaara is mortally wounded while Jack and Teal'c fight valiantly to hold their ground. They are finally forced retreat to the underground chamber where Daniel concludes that the other ascended beings are Ancients. They discover a tablet, written in the language of the Ancients, which reveals information about a lost city of the Ancients. Daniel instructs Jonas to guard it with his life, then departs."
"Carter and Jonas find another secret chamber, which Sam shoots open, revealing the Eye. Jack and Teal'c, with Skaara, appear, bedraggled from the Jaffa onslaught. Their leader, Herak, confronts SG-1, demanding the Eye. Jack simply threatens to destroy the Eye. Herak returns to the ship and informs Anubis. As Herak departs, Daniel confronts Anubis, who reveals what he truly is, a partially ascended being. In space, a fleet of Ha'tak vessels appears and Yu contacts Anubis, threatening to destroy him. Daniel, on the other hand, offers Anubis a deal: he will bring him the Eye if Anubis promises to leave Abydos unharmed forever. The Goa'uld agrees. Daniel goes to SG-1, where he hears to his surprise that Skaara has died and ascended, realizing that Oma must be present. He advises the team of Anubis' partially ascended state: stuck between the mortal world and the ascended one. Anubis was thought dead but actually ascended. The Ancients, only accepting pure of heart among their ranks, de-ascended him but not completely. The shimmering energy that hides his true face keeps his form intact. He also informs them about his deal with Anubis because he wants SG-1 to find the lost city of the Ancients before Anubis can."
"O'Neill surrenders the Eye to Herak and the Jaffa leave. On the ship, Herak gives Anubis the Eye, and Anubis powers up a large weapon. It fires on Yu's ships and destroys many of them. The few left retreat, unable to penetrate Anubis' shields, with Lord Yu, also still alive. Anubis plans to destroy Abydos but Daniel appears and demands that Anubis stop. Anubis refuses, and goads Daniel into attacking him. Daniel attempts to use his ascended powers to destroy him. However, his attack is cut short, and he is spirited away by Oma Desala. Anubis, rid of his last obstacle, fires the superweapon at the pyramid on Abydos, where Jack is, and Jack slips through the event horizon of the Abydos Stargate and back to the SGC just in time. The planet Abydos is then destroyed."
"Back at SGC, SGC personnel attempt to dial back to Abydos, but they are unable to connect, and fear that Abydos has been obliterated by Anubis's superweapon. SG-1 continue to brief General Hammond about the situation and everything that transpired on Abydos. Carter and Walter continue dialing Abydos, as Carter refuses to believe that the planet is gone. Suddenly, after dozens of attempts, the Stargate establishes a wormhole to Abydos. Hammond allows SG-1 to return to Abydos to find out what has happened. SG-1 goes through the gate and discovers Skaara and his people. Astonished and yet relieved, SG-1 ask Skaara what happened. Skaara tells them that Oma helped all the Abydonian people around the planet ascend and that the people and the Stargate are only an illusion. Skaara sadly informs them that he has not heard anything about Daniel's fate. Suddenly, all the people disappear. Relieved that the Abydonians had not perished during Anubis's attack, SG-1 then returns to Earth."
"""Full Circle"" was written with the intention of being the last ""Stargate SG-1"" television episode, since the producers were already planning to release a ""Stargate"" film. When creating the Jaffa underlings for Anubis, the producers wanted to have something different. So, according to Joseph Mallozzi, they created ""Ninja""-like Jaffa."
"""Full Circle"" was originally intended to be the last episode of ""Stargate SG-1"". It is also the last episode to feature Corin Nemec (who portrayed Jonas Quinn) as a main cast member. It is also the last episode where Alexis Cruz (who portrayed Skaara) appears. Nemec was open to continue playing Jonas Quinn after season 6 or in a feature film or a spin-off series, but a new contract was reached with Michael Shanks for Daniel to return in season 7. The role of Jonas was therefore reduced to recurring status in season 7. Nemec welcomed the producers' openness for story pitches and offered several story ideas. He wrote the mid-season-7 episode ""Fallout"" and considered pitching more stories afterwards, but he became busy with other projects. Jonas is seldom mentioned in the series after this point but after Season 10's ""Counterstrike"" stated that the Ori conquered Jonas's homeworld, ""Stargate"" producer Joseph Mallozzi said in his blog that ""in [his] mind, Jonas went underground and is still alive somewhere, resisting the Ori army."""
"= = = Scatterville, Arkansas = = ="
"Scatterville is an unincorporated community in Clay County, Arkansas, United States, approximately 2 mi (3 km) northwest of Rector. All that is left of the community today is a cemetery. The community occupied a strategic location along Crowley's Ridge and was often referred to in the reports of Union and Confederate forces vying for control of Northeast Arkansas during the American Civil War."
"Scatterville was one of the first Clay County communities, defined by having five or six families settled in a five-mile (8 km) area. Scatterville received its name because:"
". . . one man put a store at the foot of a hill, another put one at the peak, still another put one at the foot on the other side. The few stores and cabins were scattered about over the hills in a careless way."
"The first families to locate in the Scatterville community were the McNiels, Allens, Copelands, Mobleys, Snowdens, Waddells, Nortens, Mitchells, Golbys, Whites, Bradshaws, Deans, Rayburns, Whitakers, and Simmons. They were mainly subsistence farmers; however, the Allen, Knight, Simmon, Bradshaw, McNiel, and Mobley families brought a few slaves with them when they emigrated from Kentucky and Tennessee. Cotton was grown during the antebellum period, but it was only used to make clothing for personal use. A gin in Scatterville eased this task somewhat by removing the seeds from the boll. After the war, cotton was raised as a cash crop. In 1855, the first horse-powered sawmill was brought to Scatterville, and a frame school building was erected in 1859. In that same year the town welcomed Major Rayburn's new steam-powered sawmill. Other industries in Scatterville included a tanyard for shoe making and a hand-powered sorghum mill. The community remained stable until the arrival of the St. Louis and Texas Railroad about two miles (3 km) to the south in 1881. The railroad company laid out a new town named Rector, and the population of Scatterville gradually migrated to the new and booming town."
"During the American Civil War, both Union and Confederate forces operated in the area."
"On March 23, 1862, Union Col. John McNiel reported that ""There are about 1,000 men at Gainesville and Scatterville, on Crowleys Ridge. They are badly armed and scattered, in order to subsist."""
"On March 24, 1863, Union Col. John McNiel reported that ""From 400 to 700 of Jeffers and Clarks men are scattered along from Chalk Bluff to Scatterville and Gainesville."""
"On March 28, 1863, a detachment of the 1st Wisconison Cavalry Regiment passed through Scatterville in pursuit of a Confederate force under Col Preston, said to be in the area with 400 men."
"On July 21, 1863, Confederate Colonel S. G. Kitchens of the 10th Missouri Cavalry reported that a Union force of 350 was camped three miles south of Scatterville."
"On July 22, 1863, Confederate Colonel S. G. Kittchens again reported that the enemy (Union) had appeared in force in the neighborhood of Scatterville."
"The prisoners were permitted brief daily exercise in an enclosed garden. However, the windows to their rooms were painted over and they were kept in isolation from the outside. A high wooden fence was built around the outer perimeter of the house, closing it off from the street."
"About midnight on 16–17 July 1918, Commander Yurovsky entered the second-floor room of Dr. Botkin, who was awake and writing a letter. Botkin was told to awaken the Imperial family and their three remaining servants, so that the whole party could be evacuated from Yekaterinburg. The reason given was that the anti-Bolshevik White Army forces of Tsarist and moderate democratic socialists in the ensuing Russian Civil War of 1918–1921, were nearing the city and that there had been firing in the streets."
"After taking about half an hour to dress and pack, the Romanovs, Botkin and the three servants were led down a flight of stairs into the courtyard of the house, and from there through a ground-floor entrance to a small semi-basement room at the back of the building. Chairs were brought for Tsarevich Alexei and Tsarina Alexandra at the Tsar's request. The remainder of the party stood behind and to one side of the seated pair."
"After a while, Yurovsky and a party of armed men entered the basement room through the double doors. Ivan Plotnikov, history professor at the Maksim Gorky Ural State University, has established that the executioners were Yakov Yurovsky, G. P. Nikulin, M. A. Medvedev (Kudrin), Peter Ermakov, S. P. Vaganov, A. G. Kabanov, P. S. Medvedev, V. N. Netrebin, and Y. M. Tselms. Three Latvians refused at the last minute to take part in the execution."
"Yurovsky spoke briefly to the effect that their Romanov relatives had attempted to save the Imperial family, that this attempt had failed and that the Soviets were now obliged to shoot them all. He and his squad then opened fire with pistols on the prisoners."
"The number of people crowded into a comparatively small area led to an inefficient and messy slaughter. The women among the prisoners had diamonds and jewelry concealed in their clothing, deflecting many of the bullets. It took between twenty and thirty minutes before all were killed."
"As early as 1923, the photographs of the fenced house were disseminated in the Soviet press under the label of ""the last palace of the last Tsar"". In 1927, the house was designated a branch of the Ural Revolution Museum. It then became an agricultural school before taking on new life in 1938 as an anti-religious museum. During this period it was customary for party apparatchiks to arrive in large tour groups, posing before the bullet-damaged wall of the cellar in which the former Tsar and his family had been murdered. In 1946, it was taken over by the local Communist Party. In 1974, it was formally listed as a Historical-Revolutionary Monument. However, to the embarrassment of the government, it was steadily becoming a place of pilgrimage for those who wished to honour the memory of the imperial family."
"In 1977, as the sixtieth anniversary of the Russian Revolution approached, the Politburo decided to take action, declaring that the house was not of ""sufficient historical significance"", and ordering its demolition. The task was passed to Boris Yeltsin, chair of the local party, who had the house demolished in September 1977. He later wrote in his memoirs, published in 1990, that ""sooner or later we will be ashamed of this piece of barbarism."" However, despite this action, the pilgrims kept coming, often in secret and at night, leaving tokens of remembrance on the vacant site. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union that was complete by 1991, the Church on the Blood was built on the part of the site and is now a major place of pilgrimage."
"On one side of the church, there's an orthodox cross which marks the location of the Romanov family’s death. Even during the Soviet Era, there were crosses in that area, but it changed over time. Different crosses would be replaced by a new one as the years went by. A small wooden structure was eventually built behind the cross and still stands near the church today; it can be seen in the picture on the right."
"The house features as the setting for two plays: ""Ekaterinburg"" (the title being an alternate romanization of Yekaterinburg) and ""The House of Special Purpose"" (Heidi Thomas, 2009). Both plays deal with the time in captivity spent inside the Ipatiev House by the Romanovs and their retainers."
= = = DIN sync = = =
"The DIN sync standard, also called Sync24, defines a synchronization interface for electronic musical instruments."
"DIN sync was introduced in the early 1980s by Roland Corporation for the synchronization of music sequencers, drum machines, arpeggiators and similar devices. It has since been superseded by MIDI, in the mid to late 1980s. The DIN sync standard consists of two signals, clock (tempo) and run/stop. Both signals are TTL compatible, meaning the low state is 0 V and the high state is about +5 V."
"The clock signal is a low-frequency pulse wave suggesting the tempo. Instead of measuring the waveform's frequency, the machine receiving the signal merely has to count the number of pulses to work out when to increment its position in the music. Roland equipment uses 24 pulses per quarter note, known as Sync24. Therefore, a Roland compatible device playing sixteenth notes would have to advance to the next note every time it receives 6 pulses. Korg equipment uses 48 pulses per quarter note."
The run/stop signal indicates whether the sequence is playing or not.
"The DIN sync standard is so named because it uses 5-pin DIN connectors, the same as used for MIDI. DIN sync itself is not a DIN standard. Note that despite using the same connectors as MIDI, it uses different pins on these connectors (1, 2, and 3 rather than MIDI's 2, 4 and 5), so a cable made specifically for MIDI will not necessarily have the pins required for DIN sync physically connected via wires. In some applications the remaining pins (4 and 5) are used as ""tap"", ""fill in"" or ""reset and start"", but this differs from one device to another."
"If a device is a DIN sync sender, the positive slope of start/stop must reset the clock signal, and the clock signal must start with a delay of 9 ms."
"A detailed description on how to implement a DIN sync sender with Play, Pause, Continue and Stop functionality was published by E-RM Erfindungsbuero."
"The MIDI interface uses the same 5-pin DIN connectors, but is electrically not compatible with DIN sync. The MIDI protocol features a MIDI beat clock. MIDI beat clock also works with 24 ticks per quarter note."
"""Analog clock"" signals are equivalent to the clock signal at pin 3 of DIN sync interface. The clock rate is usually higher than the DIN sync's rate. Typical values are 48, 96 or 192 pulses per quarter note (examples: Oberheim DMX, DX, DSX; Linndrum 1 and 2)."
"""Analog trigger"" signals transfer a pulse per musical event. For instance a trigger corresponds to a step of an analog sequencer or an arpeggiator, a step in a rhythm pattern. Typical analog triggers run at four pulses per quarter note."
"The combination of DIN sync with a different clock system can be achieved either by converting the format and / or the clock rate (see list below) or by using a central unit (so called master clock), which provides multiple clock formats. The approach with a masterclock is usually chosen, especially if a synchronization with absolute time is required, such as synchronisation with a tape recorder or with video footage."
"Typical devices which can act as a master clock and provide DIN sync include the Roland SBX-80, Roland SBX-10, Friendchip SRC, E-RM midiclock⁺ and Yamaha MSS1. Many drum machines which have DIN sync and MIDI clock outputs can act as master clock for those two formats."
"Though DIN sync and MIDI clock have the same clock rate, they require a conversion of the format within a microprocessor or similar. The conversion from MIDI clock to DIN sync is available in many industrial devices. For the conversion from DIN sync to MIDI clock there is at the moment only the device 'Sync-Split2' of the company Innerclock Systems. Also two no longer produced devices do this type of conversion: Roland SBX10, Korg KMS30. On September 1st 2014, Roland introduced the SBX-1 which provides MIDI to sync24 or sync48 conversion."
"To get an analog trigger or clock from the DIN syncs clock signal one has to use digital frequency division or frequency multiplication. There are no dedicated industrial devices which provide a division. The Roland SBX10 can convert into a 48, 96, and 120 PPQN clock."
"Some devices have a DIN sync input as well as DIN sync output, other device have only a single DIN socket which sometimes can be switched between input and output."
"Note that sync48 devices can be combined with sync24 devices, if 32nd notes are programmed instead of 16th notes."

"Tourist Trap is a 1979 American supernatural slasher film directed by David Schmoeller and starring Chuck Connors, Jocelyn Jones, Jon Van Ness, Robin Sherwood, and Tanya Roberts. The film follows a group of young people who stumble upon a roadside museum housing mannequins that wield supernatural powers. Schmoeller co-wrote the script with J. Larry Carroll who served as producer for the film alongside famous producer/director Charles Band."
"Eileen and her boyfriend Woody are driving through the desert. When their car gets a flat, Woody goes to find a gas station. Their friends Becky, Jerry, and Molly are traveling separately in a different vehicle. They reach Eileen waiting at the car and they all drive off to collect Woody."
"Woody has found a gas station but it appears deserted. He enters the back room but becomes trapped. Various mannequins appear in the room, and multiple objects fly at him until a metal pipe impales and kills him."
"The others find a tourist trap and conclude Woody is there. As they drive in, their vehicle mysteriously breaks down. Jerry tries to fix his jeep and the girls go skinny dipping in a nearby oasis. As they swim, Mr. Slausen - the owner of said tourist trap - appears holding a shotgun. Though outwardly polite he also seems embittered by the decline of his tourist trap since the highway was moved away. The nude girls feel awkward in the water as he chats and they apologize for trespassing."
"Slausen offers to help Jerry with the jeep, but insists the group go to his house with him to get his tools. There, they see the tourist trap: animated waxworks figures, including armed bandits. Eileen is curious about a nearby house, but Slausen insists that the women should stay inside the museum. Slausen takes Jerry to fix the jeep, leaving the women. Eileen leaves to find a phone in the other house. There she finds several mannequins inside the house. Someone calls her name, and a stranger wearing a grotesque mask suddenly appears behind her. Various items in the room move of their own accord and the scarf Eileen is wearing tightens and strangles her to death."
"Slausen returns to Molly and Becky saying that Jerry drove his truck into town. When told that Eileen left, he goes to the house and finds Eileen has been turned into a mannequin. He returns and tells Molly and Becky he did not find Eileen and will leave again to continue the search. The women are frustrated, and later leave the museum to search for Eileen. Becky enters the nearby house and finds a mannequin resembling Eileen. Becky is attacked by the masked killer and then by multiple mannequins. She later wakes up tied up in the basement along with Jerry. Jerry says the killer is Slausen's brother. Also held captive is Tina (Dawn Jeffory), who is strapped to a table. She is killed when the masked man covers her face with plaster, causing her to suffocate. Jerry frees himself and attacks the killer, but is soon overpowered. Jerry tries to reach for a key but the killer telekinetically moves it from his reach."
"Molly is still outside and searching for the others. She is soon pursued by the masked man. She meets Slausen who drives her to the museum and gives her a gun while he goes inside. The masked man appears and Molly shoots, but the gun is loaded with blanks. The man removes the mask, revealing himself to be Slausen. She panics and tries to elude Slausen but is soon captured and restrained to a bed."
"Becky and Jerry escape from the basement, but get separated. Slausen appears and takes Becky to the museum. There the Old West figures begin shooting at her. Becky is killed by an Indian Chief figure who throws a knife at her, stabbing her in the back of the head. Back at the house, Jerry arrives to rescue Molly, but he is revealed to have unknowingly been turned into a mannequin. Slausen dances with the figure of his wife, and Molly sees that the wife has become animated. Traumatized, she kills Slausen with an axe."
"The next morning, an insane Molly is seen driving away in the jeep with the mannequin versions of her friends."
"The screenplay for ""Tourist Trap"" was written by David Schmoeller and J. Larry Carroll, the latter of whom pitched the film to producer Charles Band. Initially, Schmoeller intended for John Carpenter to direct the film, but Carroll was unsatisfied with the financial arrangements, and opted instead that Schmoeller should direct. Carroll and Schmoeller had previously pitched the film to producers Samuel Z. Arkoff and Bruce Cohn Curtis, but were unable to secure a production arrangement."
"The original screenplay did not feature the telekinetic powers; according to Carroll, the idea was proposed by Band, who insisted it be implemented into the script."
"The production did not appoint a casting director for the film, instead relying on independent talent agents to help cast the roles. According to director Schmoeller, $50,000 of the film's budget was dedicated to salary for the lead actor portraying the villain Mr. Slausen. The role was offered to several older Hollywood actors, such as Jack Palance and Gig Young, but both turned the project down. Chuck Connors, who was the production crew's third choice for the role, accepted the role."
"According to Schmoeller, each of the actors in the film aside from Connors auditioned for their parts. Jocelyn Jones was cast as the female lead, Molly, after Schmoeller had seen some of her previous performances, while Tanya Roberts was given the role of Becky. Jon Van Ness and Robin Sherwood were given the roles of Jerry and Eileen, respectively."
"""Tourist Trap"" was filmed in 24 days in Los Angeles County, California, with additional interiors shot at Rampart Sound Studios in Los Angeles. Principal photography began on March 27, 1978. A portion of the interior scenes were shot at an abandoned house located at 5255 Hollywood Boulevard which was scheduled for demolition. Schmoeller made arrangements with the contractor to postpone the demolition of the building for five days, during which time the crew shot footage. By using the abandoned location, the production saved an estimated $30,000 in set construction and soundstage fees. David Wyler, the son of William Wyler, served a second assistant director, while the director of photography was Nicholas von Sternberg, son of Josef von Sternberg."
"Production designer Robert A. Burns, who had worked on Tobe Hooper's ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" (1974) and Wes Craven's ""The Hills Have Eyes"" (1977), handled the art direction – and the majority of the special effects – on ""Tourist Trap"", including the mannequins and their physical manipulations. To accomplish the poltergeist-like effects in the film's opening scene, the set was constructed at a rotated 90 degrees; this allowed items to be hurled by the crew from the cabinet—which was in fact anchored to the ceiling—to the floor, which appeared on camera as a wall. Other special effects were accomplished with the use of wires. For the death sequence of Tanya Roberts's character, for example, a block of wood was taped behind Roberts's hair; a knife attached to a wire was hurled at the back of her head, which stuck into the wooden block."
"Schmoeller recalled the filming process as being a ""learning"" experience as he was a first-time director; he stated in a 2014 interview that he learned a significant amount of ""how to work with actors"" from actress Jones."
"Italian composer Pino Donaggio was in town working on Joe Dante's ""Piranha"" (1978) at the time that David Schmoeller was filming ""Tourist Trap"". Since Donaggio spoke Spanish – as did Schmoeller – the director was able to convince the composer to score the music for ""Tourist Trap"". The two would have subsequent collaborations, including ""Crawlspace"" (1986)."
"According to the American Film Institute Catalog, the film premiered in Los Angeles, California on March 14, 1979. Despite its depictions of violence and macabre images, the Motion Picture Association of America awarded the film a PG rating. Because of its rating, the film was able to receive significant broadcasting on syndicated television in the years following its theatrical release."
"From contemporary reviews, ""Variety"" wrote, ""Although pic has some appropriately menacing music and occasionally employs some decent special effects, the plot is too loaded with cliches, from the concept to individual bits of dialog to be taken seriously and not silly enough to be regarded as delightfully bad."" Charles Champlin of the ""Los Angeles Times"" wrote that the film ""has some moments of effectiveness, but even the hard-line shiverists are likely to feel it's a long time between shrieks."" Tim Pulleine of the ""Monthly Film Bulletin"" called the film a ""wholly unimaginative exercise in low-budget horror plunders ""Psycho"" for its central plot gimmick in a fashion even more hamfisted than its is bare-faced."" and that ""Nothing much is made of the potentially sinister import of the wax dummies, by comparison with whom the human performers also fail to come off too well"""
"From retrospective reviews, Author and film critic Leonard Maltin gave the film one and a half out of four stars, stating that although the film had a couple of genuine scares, it was a ""mostly boring thriller""."
"Author Stephen King, in his book ""Danse Macabre"" (1981), praised the film as an obscure classic, noting that the film ""wields an eerie spooky power, as wax figures begin to move and come to life in a ruined, out-of-the-way tourist resort."""
"Jason Buchanan from AllMovie praised the film, calling it ""one of the most underappreciated low-budget horror films of the 1970s"". In his review on the film, Buchanan commended the film's atmosphere, score, Conners' performance, and unsettling use of sound and imagery; comparing it to Tobe Hooper's ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"". ""TV Guide"" awarded the film two out of four stars, calling it a ""bizarre, eerie shocker."""
"The film was satirized by RiffTrax on November 21, 2012."
"The film was released on DVD by Cult Video on July 20, 1998. It was re-released on DVD by Wizard Entertainment on March 19, 2013. Full Moon Features released the film for the first time on Blu-ray on May 20, 2014. The Full Moon Blu-ray release features a truncated version of the film; though the film's violent scenes remain intact, minor plot points are absent from this cut of the film."

"The two lead brigades split their advances into two directions, although not on brigade boundaries. The 1st Texas and 3rd Arkansas of Robertson's brigade and the 44th and 48th Alabama of Law's brigade headed in the direction of Devil's Den, while Law directed the remaining five regiments toward the Round Tops."
"Devil's Den was located at the extreme left of the III Corps line, manned by the large brigade (six regiments and two companies of sharpshooters, 2,200 men in all) of Brigadier General J. H. Hobart Ward, in Maj. Gen. David B. Birney's division. It was the southern end of Houck's Ridge, a modest elevation on the northwest side of Plum Run Valley, made distinctive by piles of huge boulders. These boulders were not the direct avenue of approach used by the Confederates. The 3rd Arkansas and the 1st Texas drove through Rose Woods and hit Ward's line head-on. His troops had lacked the time or inclination to erect breastworks, and for over an hour both sides participated in a standup fight of unusual ferocity. In the first 30 minutes, the 20th Indiana lost more than half of its men. Its colonel, John Wheeler, was killed and its lieutenant colonel wounded. The 86th New York also lost its commander. The commander of the 3rd Arkansas fell wounded, one of 182 casualties in his regiment."
"Meanwhile, the two regiments from Law's brigade that had split from the column advancing to the Round Tops pushed up Plum Run Valley and threatened to turn Ward's flank. Their target was the 4th Maine and the 124th New York, defending the 4th New York Independent artillery battery commanded by Captain James Smith, whose fire was causing considerable disruption in Law's brigade's advance. The pressure grew great enough that Ward needed to call the 99th Pennsylvania from his far right to reinforce his left. The commander of the 124th New York, Colonel Augustus Van Horne Ellis, and his major, James Cromwell, decided to counterattack. They mounted their horses despite the protests of soldiers who urged them to lead more safely on foot. Maj. Cromwell said, ""The men must see us today."" They led the charge of their ""Orange Blossoms"" regiment to the west, down the slope of Houck's Ridge through a triangular field surrounded by a low stone fence, sending the 1st Texas reeling back . But both Colonel Ellis and Major Cromwell were shot dead as the Texans rallied with a massed volley; and the New Yorkers retreated to their starting point, with only 100 survivors from the 283 they started with. As reinforcements from the 99th Pennsylvania arrived, Ward's brigade retook the crest."
"The second wave of Hood's assault was the brigades of Henry Benning and George ""Tige"" Anderson. They detected a gap in Birney's division line: to Ward's right, there was a considerable gap before the brigade of Régis de Trobriand began. Anderson's line smashed into Trobriand and the gap at the southern edge of the Wheatfield. Trobriand wrote that the Confederates ""converged on me like an avalanche, but we piled all the dead and wounded men in our front."" The Union defense was fierce, and Anderson's brigade pulled back; its commander was wounded in the leg and was carried from the battle."
"Two of Benning's Confederate regiments, the 2nd and 17th Georgia, moved down Plum Run Valley around Ward's flank. They received murderous fire from the 99th Pennsylvania and Hazlett's battery on Little Round Top, but they kept pushing forward. Capt. Smith's New York battery was under severe pressure from three sides, but its supporting infantry regiments were suffering severe casualties and could not protect it. Three 10-pound Parrott rifles were lost to the 1st Texas, and they were used against Union troops the next day."
"Birney scrambled to find reinforcements. He sent the 40th New York and 6th New Jersey from the Wheatfield into Plum Run Valley to block the approach into Ward's flank. They collided with Benning's and Law's men in rocky, broken ground that the survivors would remember as the ""Slaughter Pen"". (Plum Run itself was known as ""Bloody Run""; Plum Run Valley as the ""Valley of Death"".) Col. Thomas W. Egan, commanding the 40th New York, was called on by Smith to recover his guns. The men of the ""Mozart"" regiment slammed into the 2nd and 17th Georgia regiments, with initial success. As Ward's line along Houck's Ridge continued to collapse, the position manned by the 40th became increasingly untenable. However, Egan pressed his regiment onward, according to Col. Wesley Hodges of the 17th Georgia, launching seven attacks against the Confederate positions within the boulders of Slaughter Pen and Devil's Den. As the men of the 40th fell back under relentless pressure, the 6th New Jersey covered their withdrawal and lost a third of its men in the process."
"The pressure on Ward's brigade was eventually too great, and he was forced to call for a retreat. Hood's division secured Devil's Den and the southern part of Houck's Ridge. The center of the fighting shifted to the northwest, to Rose Woods and the Wheatfield, while five regiments under Evander Law assaulted Little Round Top to the east. Benning's men spent the next 22 hours on Devil's Den, firing across the Valley of Death on Union troops massed on Little Round Top."
"Of 2,423 Union troops engaged, there were 821 casualties (138 killed, 548 wounded, 135 missing); the 5,525 Confederates lost 1,814 (329, 1,107, 378)."
"The Confederate assaults on Little Round Top were some of the most famous of the three-day battle and the Civil War. Arriving just as the Confederates approached, Col. Strong Vincent's brigade of the V Corps mounted a spirited defense of this position, the extreme left of the Union line, against furious assaults up the rocky slope. The stand of the 20th Maine under Col. Joshua L. Chamberlain against the 15th Alabama (Col. William C. Oates) is particularly storied, but heroes such as Strong Vincent, Patrick ""Paddy"" O'Rorke, and Charles E. Hazlett also made names for themselves."
"Lafayette McLaws arranged his division on Warfield Ridge similar to Hood's on his right—two lines of two brigades each: left front, facing the Peach Orchard, the brigade of Brig. Gen. William Barksdale; right front, Brig. Gen. Joseph B. Kershaw; left rear, Brig. Gen. William T. Wofford; right rear, Brig. Gen. Paul Jones Semmes."
"Lee's original plan called for Hood and McLaws to attack in concert, but Longstreet held back McLaws while Hood's attack progressed. Around 5 p.m., Longstreet saw that Hood's division was reaching its limits and that the enemy to its front was fully engaged. He ordered McLaws to send in Kershaw's brigade, with Barksdale's to follow on the left, beginning the ""en echelon"" attack—one brigade after another in sequence—that would be used for the rest of the afternoon's attack. McLaws resented Longstreet's hands-on management of his brigades. Those brigades engaged in some of the bloodiest fighting of the battle: the Wheatfield and the Peach Orchard."
"The area known as the Wheatfield had three geographic features, all owned by the John Rose family: the 20 acre (8 ha) field itself, Rose Woods bordering it on the west, and a modest elevation known as Stony Hill, also to the west. Immediately to the southeast was Houck's Ridge and to the south Devil's Den. The fighting here, consisting of numerous confusing attacks and counterattacks over two hours by eleven brigades, earned the field the nickname ""Bloody Wheatfield."""
"The first engagement in the Wheatfield was actually that of Anderson's brigade (Hood's division) attacking the 17th Maine of Trobriand's brigade, a spillover from Hood's attack on Houck's Ridge. Although under pressure and with its neighboring regiments on Stony Hill withdrawing, the 17th Maine held its position behind a low stone wall with the assistance of Winslow's battery, and Anderson fell back. Trobriand wrote, ""I had never seen any men fight with equal obstinacy."""
"By 5:30 p.m., when the first of Kershaw's regiments neared the Rose farmhouse, Stony Hill had been reinforced by two brigades of the 1st Division, V Corps, under Brig. Gen. James Barnes, those of Cols. William S. Tilton and Jacob B. Sweitzer. Kershaw's men placed great pressure on the 17th Maine, but it continued to hold. For some reason, however, Barnes withdrew his understrength division about to the north—without consultation with Birney's men—to a new position near the Wheatfield Road. Trobriand and the 17th Maine had to follow suit, and the Confederates seized Stony Hill and streamed into the Wheatfield. (Barnes's controversial decision was widely criticized after the battle, and it effectively ended his military career.)"
"Earlier that afternoon, as Meade realized the folly of Sickles's movement, he ordered Hancock to send a division from the II Corps to reinforce the III Corps. Hancock sent the 1st Division under Brig. Gen. John C. Caldwell from its reserve position behind Cemetery Ridge. It arrived at about 6 p.m. and three brigades, under Cols. Samuel K. Zook, Patrick Kelly (the Irish Brigade), and Edward E. Cross moved forward; the fourth brigade, under Col. John R. Brooke, was in reserve. Zook and Kelly drove the Confederates from Stony Hill, and Cross cleared the Wheatfield, pushing Kershaw's men back to the edge of Rose Woods. Both Zook and Cross were mortally wounded in leading their brigades through these assaults, as was Confederate Semmes. When Cross's men had exhausted their ammunition, Caldwell ordered Brooke to relieve them. By this time, however, the Union position in the Peach Orchard had collapsed (see next section), and Wofford's assault continued down the Wheatfield Road, taking Stony Hill and flanking the Union forces in the Wheatfield. Brooke's brigade in Rose Woods had to retreat in some disorder. Sweitzer's brigade was sent in to delay the Confederate assault, and they did this effectively in vicious hand-to-hand combat. The Wheatfield changed hands once again."
"Additional Union troops had arrived by this time. The 2nd Division of the V corps, under Brig. Gen. Romeyn B. Ayres, was known as the ""Regular Division"" because two of its three brigades were composed entirely of U.S. Army (regular army) troops, not state volunteers. (The brigade of volunteers, under Brig. Gen. Stephen H. Weed, was already engaged on Little Round Top, so only the regular army brigades arrived at the Wheatfield.) In their advance across the Valley of Death they had come under heavy fire from Confederate sharpshooters in Devil's Den. As the regulars advanced, the Confederates swarmed over Stony Hill and through Rose Woods, flanking the newly arrived brigades. The regulars retreated back to the relative safety of Little Round Top in good order, despite taking heavy casualties and pursuing Confederates. The two regular brigades suffered 829 casualties out of 2,613 engaged."
"This final Confederate assault through the Wheatfield continued past Houck's Ridge into the Valley of Death at about 7:30 p.m. The brigades of Anderson, Semmes, and Kershaw were exhausted from hours of combat in the summer heat and advanced east with units jumbled up together. Wofford's brigade followed to the left along the Wheatfield Road. As they reached the northern shoulder of Little Round Top, they were met with a counterattack from the 3rd Division (the Pennsylvania Reserves) of the V Corps, under Brig. Gen. Samuel W. Crawford. The brigade of Col. William McCandless, including a company from the Gettysburg area, spearheaded the attack and drove the exhausted Confederates back beyond the Wheatfield to Stony Hill. Realizing that his troops were too far advanced and exposed, Crawford pulled the brigade back to the east edge of the Wheatfield."
"The bloody Wheatfield remained quiet for the rest of the battle. But it took a heavy toll on the men who traded possession back-and-forth. The Confederates had fought six brigades against 13 (somewhat smaller) Federal brigades, and of the 20,444 men engaged, about 30% were casualties. Some of the wounded managed to crawl to Plum Run but could not cross it. The river ran red with their blood. As with the Cornfield at Antietam, this small expanse of agricultural ground would be remembered by veterans as a name of unique significance in the history of warfare."
"While the right wing of Kershaw's brigade attacked into the Wheatfield, its left wing wheeled left to attack the Pennsylvania troops in the brigade of Brig. Gen. Charles K. Graham, the right flank of Birney's line, where 30 guns from the III Corps and the Artillery Reserve attempted to hold the sector. The South Carolinians were subjected to infantry volleys from the Peach Orchard and canister from all along the line. Suddenly someone unknown shouted a false command, and the attacking regiments turned to their right, toward the Wheatfield, which presented their left flank to the batteries. Kershaw later wrote, ""Hundreds of the bravest and best men of Carolina fell, victims of this fatal blunder."""
"Meanwhile, the two brigades on McLaws's left—Barksdale's in front and Wofford's behind—charged directly into the Peach Orchard, the point of the salient in Sickles's line. Gen. Barksdale led the charge on horseback, long hair flowing in the wind, sword waving in the air. Brig. Gen. Andrew A. Humphreys's division had only about 1,000 men to cover the from the Peach Orchard northward along the Emmitsburg Road to the lane leading to the Abraham Trostle farm. Some were still facing south, from where they had been firing on Kershaw's brigade, so they were hit in their vulnerable flank. Barksdale's 1,600 Mississippians wheeled left against the flank of Humphreys's division, collapsing their line, regiment by regiment. Graham's brigade retreated back toward Cemetery Ridge; Graham had two horses shot out from under him. He was hit by a shell fragment, and by a bullet in his upper body. He was eventually captured by the 21st Mississippi. Wofford's men dealt with the defenders of the orchard."
"As Barksdale's men pushed toward Sickles's headquarters near the Trostle barn, the general and his staff began to move to the rear, when a cannonball caught Sickles in the right leg. He was carried off in a stretcher, sitting up and puffing on his cigar, attempting to encourage his men. That evening his leg was amputated, and he returned to Washington, D.C. Gen. Birney assumed command of the III Corps, which was soon rendered ineffective as a fighting force."
"The relentless infantry charges posed extreme danger to the Union artillery batteries in the orchard and on the Wheatfield Road, and they were forced to withdraw under pressure. The six Napoleons of Capt. John Bigelow's 9th Massachusetts Light Artillery, on the left of the line, ""retired by prolonge,"" a technique rarely used in which the cannon was dragged backwards as it fired rapidly, the movement aided by the gun's recoil. By the time they reached the Trostle house, they were told to hold the position to cover the infantry retreat, but they were eventually overrun by troops of the 21st Mississippi, who captured three of their guns."
"Humphreys's fate was sealed when the Confederate ""en echelon"" attack continued and his front and right flank began to be assaulted by the Third Corps division of Richard H. Anderson on Cemetery Ridge."
"The remaining portion of the ""en echelon"" attack was the responsibility of Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson's division of A.P. Hill's Third Corps, and he attacked starting at about 6 p.m. with five brigades in line, commencing on the right with Brig. Gen. Cadmus M. Wilcox, followed by Perry's Brigade (commanded by Col. David Lang), Brig. Gen. Ambrose R. Wright, Brig. Gen. Carnot Posey, and Brig. Gen. William Mahone."
"The brigades of Wilcox and Lang hit the front and right flank of Humphreys's line, dooming any chance for his division to maintain its position on the Emmitsburg Road and completing the collapse of the III Corps. Humphrey displayed considerable bravery during the attack, leading his men from horseback and forcing them to maintain good order during their withdrawal. He wrote to his wife, ""Twenty times did I [bring] my men to a halt and face about ... forcing the men to it."""
"On Cemetery Ridge, Generals Meade and Hancock were scrambling to find reinforcements. Meade had sent virtually all of his available troops (including most of the XII Corps, who would be needed momentarily on Culp's Hill) to his left flank to counter Longstreet's assault, leaving the center of his line relatively weak. There was insufficient infantry on Cemetery Ridge and only a few artillery pieces, rallied from the debacle of the Peach Orchard by Lt. Col. Freeman McGilvery."
"The long march from Seminary Ridge had left some of the Southern units disorganized, and their commanders paused momentarily at Plum Run to reorganize. Hancock led the II Corps brigade of Col. George L. Willard to meet Barksdale's brigade as it moved toward the ridge. Willard's New Yorkers drove the Mississippians back to Emmitsburg Road. Barksdale was wounded in his left knee, followed by a cannonball to his left foot, and finally was hit by another bullet to his chest, knocking him off his horse. His troops were forced to leave him for dead on the field, and he died the next morning in a Union field hospital. Willard was also killed, and Confederate guns drove back Willard's men in turn."
"As Hancock rode north to find additional reinforcements, he saw Wilcox's brigade nearing the base of the ridge, aiming at a gap in the Union line. The timing was critical, and Hancock chose the only troops at hand, the men of the 1st Minnesota, Harrow's Brigade, of the 2nd Division of the II Corps. They were originally placed there to guard Thomas's U.S. Battery. He pointed to a Confederate flag over the advancing line and shouted to Col. William Colvill, ""Advance, Colonel, and take those colors!"" The 262 Minnesotans charged the Alabama brigade with bayonets fixed, and they blunted their advance at Plum Run but at horrible cost—215 casualties (82%), including 40 deaths or mortal wounds, one of the largest regimental single-action losses of the war. Despite overwhelming Confederate numbers, the small 1st Minnesota, with the support of Willard's brigade on their left, checked Wilcox's advance and the Alabamians were forced to withdraw."
"The third Confederate brigade in line, under Ambrose Wright, crushed two regiments posted on the Emmitsburg Road north of the Codori farm, captured the guns of two batteries, and advanced toward a gap in the Union line just south of the Copse of Trees. (For a time, the only Union soldiers in this part of the line were Gen. Meade and some of his staff officers.) Wright's Georgia brigade may have reached the crest of Cemetery Ridge and beyond. Many historians have been skeptical of Wright's claims in his after-action report, which, if correct, would mean he passed the crest of the ridge and got as far as the Widow Leister's house before being struck in the flank and repulsed by Union reinforcements (Brig. Gen. George J. Stannard's Vermont brigade). Others believe his account was plausible because he accurately described the masses of Union troops on the Baltimore Pike that would have been invisible to him if he had been stopped earlier. Furthermore, his conversations with General Lee that evening lend support to his claim. It is possible that Lee derived some false confidence from Wright about the ability of his men to reach Cemetery Ridge the following day in Pickett's Charge."
"Wright told Lee that it was relatively easy to get to the crest, but it was difficult to stay there. A significant reason Wright could not stay was his lack of support. Two brigades were on Wright's left and could have reinforced his success. Carnot Posey's brigade made slow progress and never crossed the Emmitsburg Road, despite protestations from Wright. William Mahone's brigade inexplicably never moved at all. Gen. Anderson sent a messenger with orders to Mahone to advance, but Mahone refused. Part of the blame for the failure of Wright's assault must lie with Anderson, who took little active part in directing his division in battle."
"Lee ordered Lt. Gen. Ewell to launch a demonstration, or minor diversionary attack, on the Union right flank. He started the attack at 4 p.m. with an artillery bombardment from Benner's Hill, which caused little damage to the Union lines, but the counterbattery fire returned upon the lower hill was deadly. Ewell's best artillery officer, 19-year-old Joseph W. Latimer, the ""Boy Major"", was mortally wounded, eventually dying a month later. Ewell did not launch a conventional infantry attack until after 7 p.m., after Anderson's assault on Cemetery Ridge had crested. At around 8 p.m., two brigades of Jubal Early's division reached the Union artillery of East Cemetery Hill near the Baltimore Pike, but Union reinforcements drove them from the hill."
"Maj. Gen. Edward ""Allegheny"" Johnson's Confederate division attacked Brig. Gen. George S. Greene's XII Corps brigade behind strong breastworks on Culp's Hill. The Confederates suffered severe casualties and gained only the portions of the Union line that had been vacated under orders that afternoon by General Meade to reinforce the left flank of his line against Longstreet."
