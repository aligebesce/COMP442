I says no you don't.
No I get t tape recorder.
You and that tape recorder!
"I get the Walkman, I get the Walkman, I do."
You can't have it.
Why not?
Cos it don't belong to us.
"No but I'll, if I say it on every tape she might get the hint."
It don't belong to her.
Dunnit?
No does it heck.
"It belongs to that company, that"
"Alright, when company hear it I might get the bleeding tape"
they're not frigging hard up.
All you want that tape for is cos it's got a microphone innit?
Yours ain't got a microphone.
Mine int as good.
I thought yours were same make.
Ah that's got a radio on
"It's got a radio on, yeah."
Yeah.
I'll buy you one.
"It depends where I can spend voucher, I'll buy you one with voucher, how's that?"
So I'm not having that one then?
But he looked so little.
Looked so raw round his rear end.
"But she, she's restructured his insides."
The muscle had wasted with the pressure of the double hernia.
The muscle had sort of disintegrated almost.
She's had to use what muscle she can to restructure his bowel.
She's a marvellous surgeon.
It's  of money  isn't it?
Well the bill's nearly three hundred pound.
Oh oh!
Jesus!
Now that wouldn't be feasible in your case because .
So what we'd have to do is trade him in
Ooh ah.
It's better my back.
It's in my lower back.
"I think it's where it's been, been higher up I think it's more"
Being what?
Well I've been holding it to save it.
Yes.
That's why you should have aspirin to relax it.
Cos it helps it mend.
Ooh.
I feel as if I want to  it hurts and I feel as if I want to move it.
Yes.
He's told me be very bloody careful cos it can go out just like that.
But he did tell you to move?
Oh yes but very very gently.
He said tell it you're going to move.
Don't do anything sudden.
Tell it you're gonna move.
I like the way he puts it.
You know what I mean.
You know?
The
Alright
I think there'll be a lot of people who won't move off  to be honest!
They won't do?
", cos they won't er  go to the cost of them."
"But, like I say, we're covering that, like."
You know what I mean?
Hoh
He's bloody !
He didn't know.
"He doesn't know, he's the only one I can think of."
"He , he's, he's not in a position to say whether he knows or not."
He says he doesn't know!
Oh!
"No, well I"
It's nothing to do with him!
It's not his department.
"But he said there is a gang going round, and some are putting the chimneys on  and the others are going in and doing the flues."
"And he said, it looks as though they've put the chimney on and found that the flue is the ba the boiler's in the bathroom, so they've had to come down here."
Said because it shouldn't have a chimney on it!
"But he said, I don't know it's no , nothing to do with me!"
It's the
No.
Bri it's the British Gas that's doing it!
Oh  well that's right he's gotta blame somebody!
"But he said, I would do it because I know, I've worked for the Gas board!"
Mm.
I would know how to handle it.
"I said, well there's one thing certain, I can't!"
"Perhaps , pay good money for it!"
"Here, that one?"
Yeah.
There's lizards on all of them.
They get in your bed don't they?
Ooh.
Never got one in mine.
Lizards
When we went down the south of France we saw lizards like that on the walls.
They moved ever so quick
Yeah these do.
Yeah.
This is Tony's cellar.
Oh.
"No it's, it's literally chopped out of rock."
You can see all the steps are all
Yeah.
stone.
It's all chopped  it's like a cave.
"You go down and then  you walk along here, right to the end  right round, sort of round the bend there"
Yeah.
and there's a well.
He's got a well.
"And this is really deep ain't it Tone, this bit?"
That's about forty foot down
This is about forty foot down and then it drops again
Oh.
"into a well, where he gets his all, his fresh water from it."
"There's a li he puts a light on and it lights it up down the , a long way down."
But it never ever alters.
"You can draw water out, you can put water in, and the level never ever changes."
Wonderful water.
"It's really nice, ain't it Tone?"
It is.
"And it's covered in a, in a  po polythene would you say?"
Plastic  or what it is covered?
Cloth.
Cos you couldn't put that by the fire.
Yeah.
It would melt.
It's a cloth cover on it.
But I bet it's plastic inside it.
It's like these cushions isn't it?
It's foam.
Yes.
Foam.
But why was it so damp and cold here then?
Because it's wet and it's damp.
Well plastic doesn't hold the damp.
"It isn't plastic, it's foam!"
"Well the foam, it doesn't"
"Oh god, yes."
Well you couldn't put them in the car could you?
What?
The mattresses.
Mm?
Well I've put the big one in but I know that the rest wouldn't go in.
Mm.
But then the little bedroom wasn't so  didn't seem so damp.
"But you didn't try it did you, really?"
"In that caravan  a caravan's a caravan, call it what you like  but in that caravan that Mark is in  there was that little  room where the w hot water heater is"
Mm.
and there was a hole er on the floor over there with a grating on it that was  you could see through to the ground.
Mm.
"Well if  through the winter months  when there's no fire in there, no nothing in there  the damp is bound to be coming through there."
"You know, use that as an excuse."
Yeah.
fine okay.
"Right okay I think that's it then,er  Okay"
Right.
so  one's really the one where I need to involve you.
Basically i if you can.
Yeah.
The rest I'll let you know
I hear.
Erm I I'm also I also quite
Ooh
would like to know what's going on with  and .
Whether  actually has any er control over what  's doing in the marketplace.
Okay yeah yeah.
"I know it was Andy  last time and he's a  guy so yeah, I'll find out."
Well  you find out I might be able to find out to .
Well  yeah okay.
"Erm that was a point,, I er  spindle bearings and I want to take the business off 'em."
"Now with it being , we're not gonna look at a high margin straight away cos I know that's a waste of time."
Er but we can make a reasonable margin including spacers.
It's a set of three bearings with a pair of spacers.
"So you have two bearings in tandem, a pair of spacers and a third bearing."
And it's their normal machine centre range.
They use like about forty pairs a month.
Yeah.
"Erm  sell for about eighty seven pound including spacers so I was gonna go in at about eighty three, eighty four but it's the new pricing company so I've got to ask your permission haven't I?"
". It's a new product, I'm gonna make reasonable It's about thirty five per cent margin"
It's a new product?
No it's it's a new size for us to supply.
We've never b
Well
What is it?
Ten P off.
Oh!
That's it.
No.
Oh no he's
He's very good!
He's very
Oh well
good!
He's a good boy!
He's !
"Yeah, all fluffy and  good aren't you?"
Tongue hanging out!
Got lovely bright eyes!
Looking very well these days!
"Masters again, yeah."
What do you mean masters?
Mastered to get into the race.
"Just gave it some thought, give it some thought and initiative and you're in!"
"I bet, I bet  he's scared"
"I walked down this ledge , walked down the stage and there's  for security guards."
You cannot walk past them if  you're going in that way.
So we had to go  past this little shed which is right up  right up this stupid grass earthy bank  right over the side so we could see quickly how to get in.
"Went right round the bottom of this field, looked round the bank and there was just a bloody great  hole in the gate  massive!"
"Walked through there and got to the simulator  took our jackets off, pretended we'd already been in  walked straight past and we were right on site!"
We wasn't aware it was there.
"Well I thought, saved us twenty quid!"
So all  ?
"We were going , we were in!"
We're in!
We're in!
"Good Master Richard , y ' have young eyes ."
"Read me , I pray , this libel . ''"
Dick Shelton took the paper in his hand and read it aloud .
"It contained some lines of very rugged doggerel , hardly even rhyming , written in a gross character , and most uncouthly spelt ."
"With the spelling somewhat bettered , this is how they ran : `` I had four blak arrows under my belt , Four for the greefs that I have felt , Four for the nomber of ill menne That have opressid me now and then ."
One is gone ; one is wele sped ; Old Apulyaird is ded .
"One is for Maister Bennet Hatch , That burned Grimstone , walls and thatch ."
"One for Sir Oliver Oates , That cut Sir Harry Shelton 's throat ."
"Sir Daniel , ye shull have the fourt ; We shall think it fair sport ."
"Ye shull each have your own part , A blak arrow in each blak heart ."
"Get ye to your knees for to pray : Ye are ded theeves , by yea and nay !"
"`` JON AMEND-ALL of the Green Wood , And his jolly fellaweship ."
"`` Item , we have mo arrowes and goode hempen cord for otheres of your following . ''"
"`` Now , well-a-day for charity and the Christian graces ! ''"
"cried Sir Oliver , lamentably ."
"`` Sirs , this is an ill world , and groweth daily worse ."
"I will swear upon the cross of Holywood I am as innocent of that good knight 's hurt , whether in act or purpose , as the babe unchristened ."
"Neither was his throat cut ; for therein they are again in error , as there still live credible witnesses to show . ''"
"`` It boots not , sir parson , '' said Bennet ."
`` Here is unseasonable talk . ''
"`` Nay , Master Bennet , not so ."
"Keep ye in your due place , good Bennet , '' answered the priest ."
`` I shall make mine innocence appear .
"I will , upon no consideration , lose my poor life in error ."
I take all men to witness that I am clear of this matter .
I was not even in the Moat House .
"I was sent of an errand before nine upon the clock '' -- `` Sir Oliver , '' said Hatch , interrupting , `` since it please you not to stop this sermon , I will take other means ."
"Goffe , sound to horse . ''"
"And while the tucket was sounding , Bennet moved close to the bewildered parson , and whispered violently in his ear ."
Dick Shelton saw the priest 's eye turned upon him for an instant in a startled glance .
He had some cause for thought ; for this Sir Harry Shelton was his own natural father .
"But he said never a word , and kept his countenance unmoved ."
"`` Think out that question , too , in your thinking out , Clorinda . ''"
"`` Well , I must say bye-bye and run home ."
"I feel cheered up -- you always cheer people up , Aunt Emmy ."
How grey it is outdoors .
I do hope we 'll have snow soon .
Would n't it be jolly to have a white Christmas ?
We always have such faded brown Decembers . ''
Clorinda lived just across the road from Aunt Emmy in a tiny white house behind some huge willows .
"But Aunt Mary lived there too -- the only relative Clorinda had , for Aunt Emmy was n't really her aunt at all ."
Clorinda had always lived with Aunt Mary ever since she could remember .
"Clorinda went home and upstairs to her little room under the eaves , where the great bare willow boughs were branching athwart her windows ."
She was thinking over what Aunt Emmy had said about Christmas gifts and giving .
"`` I 'm sure I do n't know what she could have meant , '' pondered Clorinda ."
`` I do wish I could find out if it would help me any .
I 'd love to remember a few of my friends at least .
There 's Miss Mitchell ... she 's been so good to me all this year and helped me so much with my studies .
And there 's Mrs. Martin out in Manitoba .
If I could only send her something !
She must be so lonely out there .
"And Aunt Emmy herself , of course ; and poor old Aunt Kitty down the lane ; and Aunt Mary and , yes -- Florence too , although she did treat me so meanly ."
I shall never feel the same to her again .
"But she gave me a present last Christmas , and so out of mere politeness I ought to give her something . ''"
Clorinda stopped short suddenly .
She had just remembered that she would not have liked to say that last sentence to Aunt Emmy .
"Therefore , there was something wrong about it ."
Clorinda had long ago learned that there was sure to be something wrong in anything that could not be said to Aunt Emmy .
So she stopped to think it over .
Clorinda puzzled over Aunt Emmy 's meaning for four days and part of three nights .
Then all at once it came to her .
"Or if it was n't Aunt Emmy 's meaning it was a very good meaning in itself , and it grew clearer and expanded in meaning during the days that followed , although at first Clorinda shrank a little from some of the conclusions to which it led her ."
"`` I 've solved the problem of my Christmas giving for this year , '' she told Aunt Emmy ."
`` I have some things to give after all .
"Then she came over , sat down beside me , and took me in her arms . ''"
"` Do n't cry , dear little Rilla-my-Rilla ."
"You have nothing to reproach yourself with in regard to Fred ; and if Leslie West 's son asked you to keep your lips for him , I think you may consider yourself engaged to him ."
"But -- oh , my baby -- my last little baby -- I have lost you -- the war has made a woman of you too soon . '"
`` I shall never be too much of a woman to find comfort in mother 's hugs .
"Nevertheless , when I saw Fred marching by two days later in the parade , my heart ached unbearably ."
`` But I 'm glad mother thinks I 'm really engaged to Ken ! ''
"CHAPTER XXII LITTLE DOG MONDAY KNOWS `` It is two years tonight since the dance at the light , when Jack Elliott brought us news of the war ."
"Do you remember , Miss Oliver ? ''"
Cousin Sophia answered for Miss Oliver .
"`` Oh , indeed , Rilla , I remember that evening only too well , and you a-prancing down here to show off your party clothes ."
Did n't I warn you that we could not tell what was before us ?
Little did you think that night what was before you . ''
"`` Little did any of us think that , '' said Susan sharply , `` not being gifted with the power of prophecy ."
"It does not require any great foresight , Sophia Crawford , to tell a body that she will have some trouble before her life is over ."
I could do as much myself . ''
"`` We all thought the war would be over in a few months then , '' said Rilla wistfully ."
`` When I look back it seems so ridiculous that we ever could have supposed it . ''
"`` And now , two years later , it is no nearer the end than it was then , '' said Miss Oliver gloomily ."
Susan clicked her knitting-needles briskly .
"`` Now , Miss Oliver , dear , you know that is not a reasonable remark ."
"You know we are just two years nearer the end , whenever the end is appointed to be . ''"
"`` Albert read in a Montreal paper today that a war expert gives it as his opinion that it will last five years more , '' was Cousin Sophia 's cheerful contribution ."
"`` It ca n't , '' cried Rilla ; then she added with a sigh , `` Two years ago we would have said ` It ca n't last two years . '"
But five more years of this ! ''
"`` If Rumania comes in , as I have strong hopes now of her doing , you will see the end in five months instead of five years , '' said Susan ."
"`` I 've no faith in furriners , '' sighed Cousin Sophia ."
"`` The French are foreigners , '' retorted Susan , `` and look at Verdun ."
And think of all the Somme victories this blessed summer .
The Big Push is on and the Russians are still going well .
"Why , General Haig says that the German officers he has captured admit that they have lost the war . ''"
"`` You ca n't believe a word the Germans say , '' protested Cousin Sophia ."
It mattered nothing to me that the world may have thought there was some social difference between us .
"There , Jeff , you can not accuse me of not making my meaning plain . ''"
"`` Sara , '' he whispered , wondering , bewildered , half-afraid to believe this unbelievable joy ."
"`` I 'm not half worthy of you -- but -- but '' -- he bent forward and put his arm around her , looking straight into her clear , unshrinking eyes ."
"`` Sara , will you be my wife ? ''"
`` Yes . ''
She said the word clearly and truly .
"`` And I will think myself a proud and happy and honoured woman to be so , Jeff ."
"Oh , I do n't shrink from telling you the truth , you see ."
You mean too much to me for me to dissemble it .
"I 've hidden it for eighteen years because I did n't think you wanted to hear it , but I 'll give myself the delight of saying it frankly now . ''"
"She lifted her delicate , high-bred face , fearless love shining in every lineament , to his , and they exchanged their first kiss ."
"Clorinda 's Gifts `` It is a dreadful thing to be poor a fortnight before Christmas , '' said Clorinda , with the mournful sigh of seventeen years ."
Aunt Emmy smiled .
"Aunt Emmy was sixty , and spent the hours she did n't spend in a bed , on a sofa or in a wheel chair ; but Aunt Emmy was never heard to sigh ."
"`` I suppose it is worse then than at any other time , '' she admitted ."
That was one of the nice things about Aunt Emmy .
She always sympathized and understood .
"`` I 'm worse than poor this Christmas ... I 'm stony broke , '' said Clorinda dolefully ."
`` My spell of fever in the summer and the consequent doctor 's bills have cleaned out my coffers completely .
Not a single Christmas present can I give .
And I did so want to give some little thing to each of my dearest people .
"But I simply ca n't afford it ... that 's the hateful , ugly truth . ''"
Clorinda sighed again .
"`` The gifts which money can purchase are not the only ones we can give , '' said Aunt Emmy gently , `` nor the best , either . ''"
"`` Oh , I know it 's nicer to give something of your own work , '' agreed Clorinda , `` but materials for fancy work cost too ."
That kind of gift is just as much out of the question for me as any other . ''
"`` That was not what I meant , '' said Aunt Emmy ."
"`` What did you mean , then ? ''"
"asked Clorinda , looking puzzled ."
Aunt Emmy smiled .
"`` Suppose you think out my meaning for yourself , '' she said ."
"But although they had made or planned several innovations in the dinner itself , they had made no change in the usual list of guests ."
"`` It must just be the time-honoured family affair , '' Frances had declared ."
"`` If we begin inviting other folks , there is no knowing when to draw the line ."
"We ca n't have more than fourteen , and some of our friends would be sure to feel slighted . ''"
So the same old list it was .
"But now Aunt Clara -- dear , jolly Aunt Clara , whom everybody in the connection loved and admired -- could not come , and her place must be filled ."
"`` We ca n't invite the new minister , because we would have to have his sister , too , '' said Frances ."
`` And there is no reason for asking any one of our girl chums more than another . ''
"`` Mother , you will have to help us out , '' said Alma ."
`` Ca n't you suggest a substitute guest ? ''
"Mrs. Allen looked down at the two bright , girlish faces turned up to her and said slowly , `` I think I can , but I am not sure my choice will please you ."
Why not ask Miss Price ? ''
Miss Price !
They had never thought of her !
"She was the pale , timid-looking little teacher in the primary department of the Hazelwood school ."
`` Miss Price ? ''
repeated Frances slowly .
"`` Why , Mother , we hardly know her ."
"She is dreadfully dull and quiet , I think . ''"
"`` And so shy , '' said Alma ."
"`` Why , at the Wards ' party the other night she looked startled to death if anyone spoke to her ."
I believe she would be frightened to come here for Thanksgiving . ''
"`` She is a very lonely little creature , '' said Mrs. Allen gently , `` and does n't seem to have anyone belonging to her ."
I think she would be very glad to get an invitation to spend Thanksgiving elsewhere than in that cheerless little boarding-house where she lives . ''
"`` Of course , if you would like to have her , Mother , we will ask her , '' said Frances ."
"`` No , girls , '' said Mrs. Allen seriously ."
"`` You must not ask Miss Price on my account , if you do not feel prepared to make her welcome for her own sake ."
"I had hoped that your own kind hearts might have prompted you to extend a little Thanksgiving cheer in a truly Thanksgiving spirit to a lonely , hard-working girl whose life I do not think is a happy one ."
"But there , I shall not preach ."
"This is your dinner , and you must please yourselves as to your guests . ''"
"Frances and Alma had both flushed , and they now remained silent for a few minutes ."
Then Frances sprang up and threw her arms around her mother .
"Slightly married a lady of title , and so he became a lord ."
You see that judge in a wig coming out at the iron door ?
That used to be Tootles .
The bearded man who does n't know any story to tell his children was once John .
Wendy was married in white with a pink sash .
It is strange to think that Peter did not alight in the church and forbid the banns -LSB- formal announcement of a marriage -RSB- .
"Years rolled on again , and Wendy had a daughter ."
This ought not to be written in ink but in a golden splash .
"She was called Jane , and always had an odd inquiring look , as if from the moment she arrived on the mainland she wanted to ask questions ."
When she was old enough to ask them they were mostly about Peter Pan .
"She loved to hear of Peter , and Wendy told her all she could remember in the very nursery from which the famous flight had taken place ."
"It was Jane 's nursery now , for her father had bought it at the three per cents -LSB- mortgage rate -RSB- from Wendy 's father , who was no longer fond of stairs ."
Mrs. Darling was now dead and forgotten .
"There were only two beds in the nursery now , Jane 's and her nurse 's ; and there was no kennel , for Nana also had passed away ."
"She died of old age , and at the end she had been rather difficult to get on with ; being very firmly convinced that no one knew how to look after children except herself ."
Once a week Jane 's nurse had her evening off ; and then it was Wendy 's part to put Jane to bed .
That was the time for stories .
"It was Jane 's invention to raise the sheet over her mother 's head and her own , thus making a tent , and in the awful darkness to whisper : `` What do we see now ? ''"
"`` I do n't think I see anything to-night , '' says Wendy , with a feeling that if Nana were here she would object to further conversation ."
"`` Yes , you do , '' says Jane , `` you see when you were a little girl . ''"
"`` That is a long time ago , sweetheart , '' says Wendy ."
"`` Ah me , how time flies ! ''"
"`` Does it fly , '' asks the artful child , `` the way you flew when you were a little girl ? ''"
`` The way I flew ?
"Do you know , Jane , I sometimes wonder whether I ever did really fly . ''"
"`` Yes , you did . ''"
`` The dear old days when I could fly ! ''
"`` Why ca n't you fly now , mother ? ''"
"`` Because I am grown up , dearest ."
When people grow up they forget the way . ''
`` Why do they forget the way ? ''
`` Because they are no longer gay and innocent and heartless .
"Yes , they did , they went round Wendy and John and Michael , who had slipped out of bed and run to her ."
"`` George , George ! ''"
"she cried when she could speak ; and Mr. Darling woke to share her bliss , and Nana came rushing in ."
There could not have been a lovelier sight ; but there was none to see it except a little boy who was staring in at the window .
He had had ecstasies innumerable that other children can never know ; but he was looking through the window at the one joy from which he must be for ever barred .
Chapter 17 WHEN WENDY GREW UP I hope you want to know what became of the other boys .
They were waiting below to give Wendy time to explain about them ; and when they had counted five hundred they went up .
"They went up by the stair , because they thought this would make a better impression ."
"They stood in a row in front of Mrs. Darling , with their hats off , and wishing they were not wearing their pirate clothes ."
"They said nothing , but their eyes asked her to have them ."
"They ought to have looked at Mr. Darling also , but they forgot about him ."
"Of course Mrs. Darling said at once that she would have them ; but Mr. Darling was curiously depressed , and they saw that he considered six a rather large number ."
"`` I must say , '' he said to Wendy , `` that you do n't do things by halves , '' a grudging remark which the twins thought was pointed at them ."
"The first twin was the proud one , and he asked , flushing , `` Do you think we should be too much of a handful , sir ?"
"Because , if so , we can go away . ''"
`` Father ! ''
"Wendy cried , shocked ; but still the cloud was on him ."
"He knew he was behaving unworthily , but he could not help it ."
"`` We could lie doubled up , '' said Nibs ."
"`` I always cut their hair myself , '' said Wendy ."
`` George ! ''
"Mrs. Darling exclaimed , pained to see her dear one showing himself in such an unfavourable light ."
"Then he burst into tears , and the truth came out ."
"He was as glad to have them as she was , he said , but he thought they should have asked his consent as well as hers , instead of treating him as a cypher -LSB- zero -RSB- in his own house ."
"`` I do n't think he is a cypher , '' Tootles cried instantly ."
"`` Do you think he is a cypher , Curly ? ''"
"`` No , I do n't ."
"Do you think he is a cypher , Slightly ? ''"
`` Rather not .
"Twin , what do you think ? ''"
"It turned out that not one of them thought him a cypher ; and he was absurdly gratified , and said he would find space for them all in the drawing-room if they fitted in ."
"`` We 'll fit in , sir , '' they assured him ."
"It seems there was a ship lost in those parts ; and the next day a gentleman of my family was seeking wreck-wood for his fire along the sands , when he came upon a lad that was half drowned ."
"Well , he brought him to ; and he and some other gentleman took and clapped him in an auld , ruined castle , where from that day to this he has been a great expense to my friends ."
"My friends are a wee wild-like , and not so particular about the law as some that I could name ; and finding that the lad owned some decent folk , and was your born nephew , Mr. Balfour , they asked me to give ye a bit call and confer upon the matter ."
"And I may tell ye at the off-go , unless we can agree upon some terms , ye are little likely to set eyes upon him ."
"For my friends , '' added Alan , simply , `` are no very well off . ''"
My uncle cleared his throat .
"`` I 'm no very caring , '' says he ."
"`` He wasnae a good lad at the best of it , and I 've nae call to interfere . ''"
"`` Ay , ay , '' said Alan , `` I see what ye would be at : pretending ye do n't care , to make the ransom smaller . ''"
"`` Na , '' said my uncle , `` it 's the mere truth ."
"I take nae manner of interest in the lad , and I 'll pay nae ransome , and ye can make a kirk and a mill of him for what I care . ''"
"`` Hoot , sir , '' says Alan ."
"`` Blood 's thicker than water , in the deil 's name !"
"Ye cannae desert your brother 's son for the fair shame of it ; and if ye did , and it came to be kennt , ye wouldnae be very popular in your country-side , or I 'm the more deceived . ''"
"`` I 'm no just very popular the way it is , '' returned Ebenezer ; `` and I dinnae see how it would come to be kennt ."
"No by me , onyway ; nor yet by you or your friends ."
"So that 's idle talk , my buckie , '' says he ."
"`` Then it 'll have to be David that tells it , '' said Alan ."
`` How that ? ''
"says my uncle , sharply ."
"`` Ou , just this way , '' says Alan ."
"`` My friends would doubtless keep your nephew as long as there was any likelihood of siller to be made of it , but if there was nane , I am clearly of opinion they would let him gang where he pleased , and be damned to him ! ''"
"`` Ay , but I 'm no very caring about that either , '' said my uncle ."
`` I wouldnae be muckle made up with that . ''
"`` I was thinking that , '' said Alan ."
`` And what for why ? ''
asked Ebenezer .
"`` Why , Mr. Balfour , '' replied Alan , `` by all that I could hear , there were two ways of it : either ye liked David and would pay to get him back ; or else ye had very good reasons for not wanting him , and would pay for us to keep him ."
"It seems it 's not the first ; well then , it 's the second ; and blythe am I to ken it , for it should be a pretty penny in my pocket and the pockets of my friends . ''"
"`` I dinnae follow ye there , '' said my uncle ."
`` No ? ''
said Alan .
"`` It is the ruin of this kind land , '' a woman said ."
"`` If the barons live at war , ploughfolk must eat roots . ''"
"`` Nay , '' said Dick , `` every man that follows shall have sixpence a day , and archers twelve . ''"
"`` If they live , '' returned the woman , `` that may very well be ; but how if they die , my master ? ''"
"`` They can not better die than for their natural lord , '' said Dick ."
"`` No natural lord of mine , '' said the man in the smock ."
"`` I followed the Walsinghams ; so we all did down Brierly way , till two years ago , come Candlemas ."
And now I must side with Brackley !
It was the law that did it ; call ye that natural ?
"But now , what with Sir Daniel and what with Sir Oliver -- that knows more of law than honesty -- I have no natural lord but poor King Harry the Sixt , God bless him !"
-- the poor innocent that can not tell his right hand from his left . ''
"`` Ye speak with an ill tongue , friend , '' answered Dick , `` to miscall your good master and my lord the king in the same libel ."
But King Harry -- praised be the saints !
"-- has come again into his right mind , and will have all things peaceably ordained ."
"And as for Sir Daniel , y ' are very brave behind his back ."
But I will be no tale-bearer ; and let that suffice . ''
"`` I say no harm of you , Master Richard , '' returned the peasant ."
"`` Y ' are a lad ; but when ye come to a man 's inches , ye will find ye have an empty pocket ."
"I say no more : the saints help Sir Daniel 's neighbours , and the Blessed Maid protect his wards ! ''"
"`` Clipsby , '' said Richard , `` you speak what I can not hear with honour ."
"Sir Daniel is my good master , and my guardian . ''"
"`` Come , now , will ye read me a riddle ? ''"
returned Clipsby .
`` On whose side is Sir Daniel ? ''
"`` I know not , '' said Dick , colouring a little ; for his guardian had changed sides continually in the troubles of that period , and every change had brought him some increase of fortune ."
"`` Ay , '' returned Clipsby , `` you , nor no man ."
"For , indeed , he is one that goes to bed Lancaster and gets up York . ''"
"Just then the bridge rang under horse-shoe iron , and the party turned and saw Bennet Hatch come galloping -- a brown-faced , grizzled fellow , heavy of hand and grim of mien , armed with sword and spear , a steel salet on his head , a leather jack upon his body ."
"He was a great man in these parts ; Sir Daniel 's right hand in peace and war , and at that time , by his master 's interest , bailiff of the hundred ."
"`` Clipsby , '' he shouted , `` off to the Moat House , and send all other laggards the same gate ."
Bowyer will give you jack and salet .
We must ride before curfew .
said Mrs. Danby .
"`` He lives down there at Four Winds , as they call it -- he and his daughter and an old cousin . ''"
"Isabel King bent forward , her brown eyes on Alan 's face ."
`` Did you see Lynde Oliver ? ''
she asked with suppressed eagerness .
Alan ignored the question -- perhaps he did not hear it .
`` Have they lived there long ? ''
he asked .
"`` For eighteen years , '' said Mrs. Danby placidly ."
`` It 's funny you have n't heard them mentioned .
"But people do n't talk much about the Captain now -- he 's an old story -- and of course they never go anywhere , not even to church ."
The Captain is a rank infidel and they say his daughter is just as bad .
"To be sure , nobody knows much about her , but it stands to reason that a girl who 's had her bringing up must be odd , to say no worse of her ."
"It 's not really her fault , I suppose -- her wicked old scalawag of a father is to blame for it ."
"She 's never darkened a church or school door in her life and they say she 's always been a regular tomboy -- running wild outdoors with dogs , and fishing and shooting like a man ."
Nobody ever goes there -- the Captain does n't want visitors .
"He must have done something dreadful in his time , if it was only known , when he 's so set on living like a hermit away down on that jumping-off place ."
Did you see any of them ? ''
"`` I saw Miss Oliver , I suppose , '' said Alan briefly ."
`` At least I met a young lady on the shore .
But where did these people come from ?
Surely more is known of them than this . ''
`` Precious little .
"The truth is , Mr. Douglas , folks do n't think the Olivers respectable and do n't want to have anything to do with them ."
"Eighteen years ago Captain Anthony came from goodness knows where , bought the Four Winds point , and built that house ."
He said he 'd been a sailor all his life and could n't live away from the water .
He brought his wife and child and an old cousin of his with him .
This Lynde was n't more than two years old then .
People went to call but they never saw any of the women and the Captain let them see they were n't wanted .
"Some of the men who 'd been working round the place saw his wife and said she was sickly but real handsome and like a lady , but she never seemed to want to see anyone or be seen herself ."
There was a story that the Captain had been a smuggler and that if he was caught he 'd be sent to prison .
"Oh , there were all sorts of yarns , mostly coming from the men who worked there , for nobody else ever got inside the house ."
"`` And now , Livesey , '' said the squire in the same breath ."
"`` One at a time , one at a time , '' laughed Dr. Livesey ."
"`` You have heard of this Flint , I suppose ? ''"
`` Heard of him ! ''
cried the squire .
"`` Heard of him , you say !"
He was the bloodthirstiest buccaneer that sailed .
Blackbeard was a child to Flint .
"The Spaniards were so prodigiously afraid of him that , I tell you , sir , I was sometimes proud he was an Englishman ."
"I 've seen his top-sails with these eyes , off Trinidad , and the cowardly son of a rum-puncheon that I sailed with put back -- put back , sir , into Port of Spain . ''"
"`` Well , I 've heard of him myself , in England , '' said the doctor ."
"`` But the point is , had he money ? ''"
`` Money ! ''
cried the squire .
`` Have you heard the story ?
What were these villains after but money ?
What do they care for but money ?
For what would they risk their rascal carcasses but money ? ''
"`` That we shall soon know , '' replied the doctor ."
`` But you are so confoundedly hot-headed and exclamatory that I can not get a word in .
"What I want to know is this : Supposing that I have here in my pocket some clue to where Flint buried his treasure , will that treasure amount to much ? ''"
"`` Amount , sir ! ''"
cried the squire .
"`` It will amount to this : If we have the clue you talk about , I fit out a ship in Bristol dock , and take you and Hawkins here along , and I 'll have that treasure if I search a year . ''"
"`` Very well , '' said the doctor ."
"`` Now , then , if Jim is agreeable , we 'll open the packet '' ; and he laid it before him on the table ."
"The bundle was sewn together , and the doctor had to get out his instrument case and cut the stitches with his medical scissors ."
It contained two things -- a book and a sealed paper .
"`` First of all we 'll try the book , '' observed the doctor ."
"The squire and I were both peering over his shoulder as he opened it , for Dr. Livesey had kindly motioned me to come round from the side-table , where I had been eating , to enjoy the sport of the search ."
"On the first page there were only some scraps of writing , such as a man with a pen in his hand might make for idleness or practice ."
"One was the same as the tattoo mark , `` Billy Bones his fancy '' ; then there was `` Mr. W. Bones , mate , '' `` No more rum , '' `` Off Palm Key he got itt , '' and some other snatches , mostly single words and unintelligible ."
"They were not only new trousers , but they were the first he had ever had with braid on them , and he had to bite his lip to prevent the tears coming ."
"Of course Mrs. Darling brushed him , but he began to talk again about its being a mistake to have a dog for a nurse ."
"` George , Nana is a treasure . '"
"` No doubt , but I have an uneasy feeling at times that she looks upon the children as puppies . '"
"` Oh no , dear one , I feel sure she knows they have souls . ' '"
"I wonder , ' Mr. Darling said thoughtfully , ' I wonder . '"
"It was an opportunity , his wife felt , for telling him about the boy ."
"At first he pooh-poohed the story , but he became thoughtful when she showed him the shadow ."
"` It is nobody I know , ' he said , examining it carefully , ` but he does look a scoundrel . '"
"` We were still discussing it , you remember , ' says Mr. Darling , ` when Nana came in with Michael 's medicine ."
"You will never carry the bottle in your mouth again , Nana , and it is all my fault ."
"Strong man though he was , there is no doubt that he had behaved rather foolishly over the medicine ."
"If he had a weakness , it was for thinking that all his life he had taken medicine boldly ; and so now , when Michael dodged the spoon in Nana 's mouth , he had said reprovingly , ` Be a man , Michael . '"
"` Wo n't ; wo n't , ' Michael cried naughtily ."
"Mrs. Darling left the room to get a chocolate for him , and Mr. Darling thought this showed want of firmness ."
"` Mother , do n't pamper him , ' he called after her ."
"` Michael , when I was your age I took medicine without a murmur ."
"I said `` Thank you , kind parents , for giving me bottles to make me well . '' '"
"He really thought this was true , and Wendy , who was now in her night-gown , believed it also , and she said , to encourage Michael , ` That medicine you sometimes take , father , is much nastier , is n't it ? '"
"` Ever so much nastier , ` Mr. Darling said bravely , ` and I would take it now as an example to you , Michael , if I had n't lost the bottle . '"
He had not exactly lost it ; he had climbed in the dead of night to the top of the wardrobe and hidden it there .
"What he did not know was that the faithful Liza had found it , and put it back on his wash-stand . '"
"I know where it is , father , ' Wendy cried , always glad to be of service ."
"` I 'll bring it , ' and she was off before he could stop her ."
Immediately his spirits sank in the strangest way .
"` John , ' he said , shuddering , ` it 's most beastly stuff ."
"It 's that nasty , sticky , sweet kind . '"
"` It will soon be over , father , ' John said cheerily , and then in rushed Wendy with the medicine in a glass . '"
"I have been as quick as I could , ' she panted ."
"` You have been wonderfully quick , ' her father retorted , with a vindictive politeness that was quite thrown away upon her ."
"` Michael first , ' he said doggedly ."
"` Father first , ' said Michael , who was of a suspicious nature . '"
Then they both dried their tears and went to work at the preparations for moving .
"`` Since we must go let us go as soon as we can and have it over , '' said poor Anne with bitter resignation ."
"`` You know you will like that lovely old place at the Glen after you have lived in it long enough to have dear memories woven about it , '' said Leslie ."
"`` Friends will come there , as they have come here -- happiness will glorify it for you ."
"Now , it 's just a house to you -- but the years will make it a home . ''"
Anne and Leslie had another cry the next week when they shortened Little Jem .
Anne felt the tragedy of it until evening when in his long nightie she found her own dear baby again .
"`` But it will be rompers next -- and then trousers -- and in no time he will be grown-up , '' she sighed ."
"`` Well , you would not want him to stay a baby always , Mrs. Doctor , dear , would you ? ''"
said Susan .
"`` Bless his innocent heart , he looks too sweet for anything in his little short dresses , with his dear feet sticking out ."
"And think of the save in the ironing , Mrs. Doctor , dear . ''"
"`` Anne , I have just had a letter from Owen , '' said Leslie , entering with a bright face ."
"`` And , oh !"
I have such good news .
He writes me that he is going to buy this place from the church trustees and keep it to spend our summer vacations in .
"Anne , are you not glad ? ''"
"`` Oh , Leslie , ` glad ' is n't the word for it !"
It seems almost too good to be true .
"I sha 'n' t feel half so badly now that I know this dear spot will never be desecrated by a vandal tribe , or left to tumble down in decay ."
"Why , it 's lovely !"
It 's lovely ! ''
One October morning Anne wakened to the realisation that she had slept for the last time under the roof of her little house .
The day was too busy to indulge regret and when evening came the house was stripped and bare .
Anne and Gilbert were alone in it to say farewell .
Leslie and Susan and Little Jem had gone to the Glen with the last load of furniture .
The sunset light streamed in through the curtainless windows .
"`` It has all such a heart-broken , reproachful look , has n't it ? ''"
said Anne .
"`` Oh , I shall be so homesick at the Glen tonight ! ''"
"`` We have been very happy here , have n't we , Anne-girl ? ''"
"said Gilbert , his voice full of feeling ."
"`` Nay , it is the way of England ."
What would ye have ? ''
the earl demanded .
"`` But ye are unjust to the knight of Tunstall ; and as faith goes , in this unfaithful generation , he hath of late been honourably true to us of Lancaster ."
Even in our last reverses he stood firm . ''
"`` An it pleased you , then , '' said Dick , `` to cast your eye upon this letter , ye might somewhat change your thought of him ; '' and he handed to the earl Sir Daniel 's letter to Lord Wensleydale ."
"The effect upon the earl 's countenance was instant ; he lowered like an angry lion , and his hand , with a sudden movement , clutched at his dagger ."
`` Ye have read this also ? ''
he asked .
"`` Even so , '' said Dick ."
`` It is your lordship 's own estate he offers to Lord Wensleydale ? ''
"`` It is my own estate , even as ye say ! ''"
returned the earl .
`` I am your bedesman for this letter .
It hath shown me a fox 's hole .
"Command me , Master Shelton ; I will not be backward in gratitude , and to begin with , York or Lancaster , true man or thief , I do now set you at freedom ."
"Go , a Mary 's name !"
"But judge it right that I retain and hang your fellow , Lawless ."
"The crime hath been most open , and it were fitting that some open punishment should follow . ''"
"`` My lord , I make it my first suit to you to spare him also , '' pleaded Dick ."
"`` It is an old , condemned rogue , thief , and vagabond , Master Shelton , '' said the earl ."
`` He hath been gallows-ripe this score of years .
"And , whether for one thing or another , whether to-morrow or the day after , where is the great choice ? ''"
"`` Yet , my lord , it was through love to me that he came hither , '' answered Dick , `` and I were churlish and thankless to desert him . ''"
"`` Master Shelton , ye are troublesome , '' replied the earl , severely ."
`` It is an evil way to prosper in this world .
"Howbeit , and to be quit of your importunity , I will once more humour you ."
"Go , then , together ; but go warily , and get swiftly out of Shoreby town ."
For this Sir Daniel -LRB- whom may the saints confound ! -RRB-
thirsteth most greedily to have your blood . ''
"`` My lord , I do now offer you in words my gratitude , trusting at some brief date to pay you some of it in service , '' replied Dick , as he turned from the apartment ."
"CHAPTER VI -- ARBLASTER AGAIN When Dick and Lawless were suffered to steal , by a back way , out of the house where Lord Risingham held his garrison , the evening had already come ."
"`` Oh , if Susan and you are both banded together against me ! ''"
said Anne helplessly .
"One day the glorious news came that the Canadians had taken Courcelette and Martenpuich , with many prisoners and guns ."
Susan ran up the flag and said it was plain to be seen that Haig knew what soldiers to pick for a hard job .
The others dared not feel exultant .
Who knew what price had been paid ?
"Rilla woke that morning when the dawn was beginning to break and went to her window to look out , her thick creamy eyelids heavy with sleep ."
Just at dawn the world looks as it never looks at any other time .
The air was cold with dew and the orchard and grove and Rainbow Valley were full of mystery and wonder .
Over the eastern hill were golden deeps and silvery-pink shallows .
"There was no wind , and Rilla heard distinctly a dog howling in a melancholy way down in the direction of the station ."
Was it Dog Monday ?
"And if it were , why was he howling like that ?"
Rilla shivered ; the sound had something boding and grievous in it .
"She remembered that Miss Oliver said once , when they were coming home in the darkness and heard a dog howl , `` When a dog cries like that the Angel of Death is passing . ''"
Rilla listened with a curdling fear at her heart .
It was Dog Monday -- she felt sure of it .
Whose dirge was he howling -- to whose spirit was he sending that anguished greeting and farewell ?
Rilla went back to bed but she could not sleep .
All day she watched and waited in a dread of which she did not speak to anyone .
"She went down to see Dog Monday and the station-master said , `` That dog of yours howled from midnight to sunrise something weird ."
I dunno what got into him .
I got up once and went out and hollered at him but he paid no ` tention to me .
"He was sitting all alone in the moonlight out there at the end of the platform , and every few minutes the poor lonely little beggar 'd lift his nose and howl as if his heart was breaking ."
He never did it afore -- always slept in his kennel real quiet and canny from train to train .
But he sure had something on his mind last night . ''
Dog Monday was lying in his kennel .
He wagged his tail and licked Rilla 's hand .
But he would not touch the food she brought for him .
"`` I 'm afraid he 's sick , '' she said anxiously ."
She hated to go away and leave him .
But no bad news came that day -- nor the next -- nor the next .
`` The first week in June was another dreadful one .
"The Austrians seemed just on the point of overrunning Italy : and then came the first awful news of the Battle of Jutland , which the Germans claimed as a great victory ."
Susan was the only one who carried on .
"` You need never tell me that the Kaiser has defeated the British Navy , ' she said , with a contemptuous sniff ."
` It is all a German lie and that you may tie to . '
"And when a couple of days later we found out that she was right and that it had been a British victory instead of a British defeat , we had to put up with a great many ' I told you so 's , ' but we endured them very comfortably ."
`` It took Kitchener 's death to finish Susan .
For the first time I saw her down and out .
We all felt the shock of it but Susan plumbed the depths of despair .
The news came at night by ` phone but Susan would n't believe it until she saw the Enterprise headline the next day .
"She did not cry or faint or go into hysterics ; but she forgot to put salt in the soup , and that is something Susan never did in my recollection ."
"Mother and Miss Oliver and I cried but Susan looked at us in stony sarcasm and said , ` The Kaiser and his six sons are all alive and thriving ."
So the world is not left wholly desolate .
"Why cry , Mrs. Dr. dear ? '"
"Susan continued in this stony , hopeless condition for twenty-four hours , and then Cousin Sophia appeared and began to condole with her . ''"
"` This is terrible news , ai n't it , Susan ?"
We might as well prepare for the worst for it is bound to come .
"You said once -- and well do I remember the words , Susan Baker -- that you had complete confidence in God and Kitchener ."
"Ah well , Susan Baker , there is only God left now . '"
`` Whereat Cousin Sophia put her handkerchief to her eyes pathetically as if the world were indeed in terrible straits .
"As for Susan , Cousin Sophia was the salvation of her ."
She came to life with a jerk . ''
"` Sophia Crawford , hold your peace ! '"
she said sternly .
` You may be an idiot but you need not be an irreverent idiot .
It is no more than decent to be weeping and wailing because the Almighty is the sole stay of the Allies now .
"As for Kitchener , his death is a great loss and I do not dispute it ."
But the outcome of this war does not depend on one man 's life and now that the Russians are coming on again you will soon see a change for the better . '
`` Susan said this so energetically that she convinced herself and cheered up immediately .
But Cousin Sophia shook her head . ''
"` Albert 's wife wants to call the baby after Brusiloff , ' she said , ` but I told her to wait and see what becomes of him first ."
Them Russians has such a habit of petering out . '
"`` Redheaded snippet , '' quoted Ginger in a tone of profound contempt ."
"At this point Mr. Harrison arose and , with an expression that would have struck terror into any bird but a parrot , carried Ginger 's cage into an adjoining room and shut the door ."
"Ginger shrieked , swore , and otherwise conducted himself in keeping with his reputation , but finding himself left alone , relapsed into sulky silence ."
"`` Excuse me and go on , '' said Mr. Harrison , sitting down again ."
`` My brother the sailor never taught that bird any manners . ''
`` I went home and after tea I went out to the milking pen .
"Mr. Harrison , '' ... Anne leaned forward , clasping her hands with her old childish gesture , while her big gray eyes gazed imploringly into Mr. Harrison 's embarrassed face ... `` I found my cow still shut up in the pen ."
It was YOUR cow I had sold to Mr. Shearer . ''
"`` Bless my soul , '' exclaimed Mr. Harrison , in blank amazement at this unlooked-for conclusion ."
`` What a VERY extraordinary thing ! ''
"`` Oh , it is n't in the least extraordinary that I should be getting myself and other people into scrapes , '' said Anne mournfully ."
`` I 'm noted for that .
You might suppose I 'd have grown out of it by this time ... I 'll be seventeen next March ... but it seems that I have n't .
"Mr. Harrison , is it too much to hope that you 'll forgive me ?"
"I 'm afraid it 's too late to get your cow back , but here is the money for her ... or you can have mine in exchange if you 'd rather ."
She 's a very good cow .
And I ca n't express how sorry I am for it all . ''
"`` Tut , tut , '' said Mr. Harrison briskly , `` do n't say another word about it , miss ."
It 's of no consequence ... no consequence whatever .
Accidents will happen .
"I 'm too hasty myself sometimes , miss ... far too hasty ."
But I ca n't help speaking out just what I think and folks must take me as they find me .
"If that cow had been in my cabbages now ... but never mind , she was n't , so it 's all right ."
"I think I 'd rather have your cow in exchange , since you want to be rid of her . ''"
"`` Oh , thank you , Mr. Harrison ."
I 'm so glad you are not vexed .
I was afraid you would be . ''
"`` And I suppose you were scared to death to come here and tell me , after the fuss I made yesterday , hey ?"
"But you must n't mind me , I 'm a terrible outspoken old fellow , that 's all ... awful apt to tell the truth , no matter if it is a bit plain . ''"
"`` So is Mrs. Lynde , '' said Anne , before she could prevent herself ."
`` Who ?
Mrs. Lynde ?
"He gave his hat to Liza , who took it scornfully ; for she had no imagination , and was quite incapable of understanding the motives of such a man ."
"Outside , the crowd who had accompanied the cab home were still cheering , and he was naturally not unmoved ."
"`` Listen to them , '' he said ; `` it is very gratifying . ''"
"`` Lots of little boys , '' sneered Liza ."
"`` There were several adults to-day , '' he assured her with a faint flush ; but when she tossed her head he had not a word of reproof for her ."
Social success had not spoilt him ; it had made him sweeter .
"For some time he sat with his head out of the kennel , talking with Mrs. Darling of this success , and pressing her hand reassuringly when she said she hoped his head would not be turned by it ."
"`` But if I had been a weak man , '' he said ."
"`` Good heavens , if I had been a weak man ! ''"
"`` And , George , '' she said timidly , `` you are as full of remorse as ever , are n't you ? ''"
"`` Full of remorse as ever , dearest !"
See my punishment : living in a kennel . ''
"`` But it is punishment , is n't it , George ?"
You are sure you are not enjoying it ? ''
`` My love ! ''
"You may be sure she begged his pardon ; and then , feeling drowsy , he curled round in the kennel ."
"`` Wo n't you play me to sleep , '' he asked , `` on the nursery piano ? ''"
"and as she was crossing to the day-nursery he added thoughtlessly , `` And shut that window ."
I feel a draught . ''
"`` O George , never ask me to do that ."
"The window must always be left open for them , always , always . ''"
"Now it was his turn to beg her pardon ; and she went into the day-nursery and played , and soon he was asleep ; and while he slept , Wendy and John and Michael flew into the room ."
Oh no .
"We have written it so , because that was the charming arrangement planned by them before we left the ship ; but something must have happened since then , for it is not they who have flown in , it is Peter and Tinker Bell ."
Peter 's first words tell all .
"`` Quick Tink , '' he whispered , `` close the window ; bar it !"
That 's right .
Now you and I must get away by the door ; and when Wendy comes she will think her mother has barred her out ; and she will have to go back with me . ''
"Now I understand what had hitherto puzzled me , why when Peter had exterminated the pirates he did not return to the island and leave Tink to escort the children to the mainland ."
This trick had been in his head all the time .
Instead of feeling that he was behaving badly he danced with glee ; then he peeped into the day-nursery to see who was playing .
"He whispered to Tink , `` It 's Wendy 's mother !"
"They sat thus night after night recalling that fatal Friday , till every detail of it was stamped on their brains and came through on the other side like the faces on a bad coinage ."
"` If only I had not accepted that invitation to dine at 27 , ' Mrs. Darling said ."
"` If only I had not poured my medicine into Nana 's bowl , ' said Mr. Darling ."
"` If only I had pretended to like the medicine , ' was what Nana 's wet eyes said ."
"` My liking for parties , George . '"
"` My fatal gift of humour , dearest . '"
"` My touchiness about trifles , dear master and mistress . '"
"Then one or more of them would break down altogether ; Nana at the thought , ` It 's true , it 's true , they ought not to have had a dog for a nurse . '"
Many a time it was Mr. Darling who put the handkerchief to Nana 's eyes .
` That fiend ! '
"Mr. Darling would cry , and Nana 's bark was the echo of it , but Mrs. Darling never upbraided Peter ; there was something in the right-hand corner of her mouth that wanted her not to call Peter names ."
"They would sit there in the empty nursery , recalling fondly every smallest detail of that dreadful evening ."
"It had begun so uneventfully , so precisely like a hundred other evenings , with Nana putting on the water for Michael 's bath and carrying him to it on her back . '"
"I wo n't go to bed , ' he had shouted , like one who still believed that he had the last word on the subject , ' I wo n't , I wo n't ."
"Nana , it is n't six o'clock yet ."
"Oh dear , oh dear , I sha n't love you any more , Nana ."
"I tell you I wo n't be bathed , I wo n't , I wo n't ! '"
"Then Mrs. Darling had come in , wearing her white evening-gown ."
"She had dressed early because Wendy so loved to see her in her evening-gown , with the necklace George had given her ."
She was wearing Wendy 's bracelet on her arm ; she had asked for the loan of it .
Wendy so loved to lend her bracelet to her mother .
"She had found her two older children playing at being herself and father on the occasion of Wendy 's birth , and John was saying : ' I am happy to inform you , Mrs. Darling , that you are now a mother , ' in just such a tone as Mr. Darling himself may have used on the real occasion ."
"Wendy had danced with joy , just as the real Mrs. Darling must have done ."
"Then John was born , with the extra pomp that he conceived due to the birth of a male , and Michael came from his bath to ask to be born also , but John said brutally that they did not want any more ."
Michael had nearly cried .
"` Nobody wants me , ' he said , and of course the lady in evening-dress could not stand that . '"
"I do , ' she said , ' I so want a third child . '"
` Boy or girl ? '
"asked Michael , not too hopefully ."
` Boy . '
Then he had leapt into her arms .
"Such a little thing for Mr. and Mrs. Darling and Nana to recall now , but not so little if that was to be Michael 's last night in the nursery ."
`` Course I do .
But you ca n't be a gemplum till you grow up . ''
"`` Oh , indeed you can , '' Anne hastened to say , thinking she saw a chance to sow good seed betimes ."
`` You can begin to be a gentleman when you are a little boy .
And gentlemen NEVER snatch things from ladies ... or forget to say thank you ... or pull anybody 's hair . ''
"`` They do n't have much fun , that 's a fact , '' said Davy frankly ."
`` I guess I 'll wait till I 'm grown up to be one . ''
"Marilla , with a resigned air , had cut another piece of cake for Dora ."
She did not feel able to cope with Davy just then .
"It had been a hard day for her , what with the funeral and the long drive ."
At that moment she looked forward to the future with a pessimism that would have done credit to Eliza Andrews herself .
"The twins were not noticeably alike , although both were fair ."
Dora had long sleek curls that never got out of order .
Davy had a crop of fuzzy little yellow ringlets all over his round head .
Dora 's hazel eyes were gentle and mild ; Davy 's were as roguish and dancing as an elf 's .
"Dora 's nose was straight , Davy 's a positive snub ; Dora had a `` prunes and prisms '' mouth , Davy 's was all smiles ; and besides , he had a dimple in one cheek and none in the other , which gave him a dear , comical , lopsided look when he laughed ."
Mirth and mischief lurked in every corner of his little face .
"`` They 'd better go to bed , '' said Marilla , who thought it was the easiest way to dispose of them ."
`` Dora will sleep with me and you can put Davy in the west gable .
"You 're not afraid to sleep alone , are you , Davy ? ''"
"`` No ; but I ai n't going to bed for ever so long yet , '' said Davy comfortably ."
"`` Oh , yes , you are . ''"
"That was all the much-tried Marilla said , but something in her tone squelched even Davy ."
He trotted obediently upstairs with Anne .
"`` When I 'm grown up the very first thing I 'm going to do is stay up ALL night just to see what it would be like , '' he told her confidentially ."
In after years Marilla never thought of that first week of the twins ' sojourn at Green Gables without a shiver .
Not that it really was so much worse than the weeks that followed it ; but it seemed so by reason of its novelty .
"There was seldom a waking minute of any day when Davy was not in mischief or devising it ; but his first notable exploit occurred two days after his arrival , on Sunday morning ... a fine , warm day , as hazy and mild as September ."
Anne dressed him for church while Marilla attended to Dora .
Davy at first objected strongly to having his face washed .
`` Marilla washed it yesterday ... and Mrs. Wiggins scoured me with hard soap the day of the funeral .
That 's enough for one week .
"`` A mother is the best thing in the world -- I realized that when I lost mine , '' said Alan gently ."
`` How long is it since your mother died ? ''
`` Three years .
"Oh , I thought I should die too when she did ."
"She was very ill -- she was never strong , you know -- but I never thought she could die ."
There was a year then -- part of the time I did n't believe in God at all and the rest I hated Him .
I was very wicked but I was so unhappy .
Father had so many dreadful moods and -- there was something else .
I used to wish to die . ''
She bowed her head on her hands and gazed moodily on the ground .
"Alan , leaning against a pine tree , looked down at her ."
The sunlight fell through the swaying boughs on her glory of burnished hair and lighted up the curve of cheek and chin against the dark background of wood brown .
"All the defiance and wildness had gone from her for the time and she seemed like a helpless , weary child ."
He wanted to take her in his arms and comfort her .
"`` You must resemble your mother , '' he said absently , as if thinking aloud ."
`` You do n't look at all like your father . ''
Lynde shook her head .
"`` No , I do n't look like Mother either ."
She was tiny and dark -- she had a sweet little face and velvet-brown eyes and soft curly dark hair .
"Oh , I remember her look so well ."
I wish I did resemble her .
I loved her so -- I would have done anything to save her suffering and trouble .
"At least , she died in peace . ''"
There was a curious note of fierce self-gratulation in the girl 's voice as she spoke the last sentence .
Again Alan felt the unpleasant impression that there was much in her that he did not understand -- might never understand -- although such understanding was necessary to perfect friendship .
"She had never spoken so freely of her past life to him before , yet he felt somehow that something was being kept back in jealous repression ."
"It must be something connected with her father , Alan thought ."
"Doubtless , Captain Anthony 's past would not bear inspection , and his daughter knew it and dwelt in the shadow of her knowledge ."
His heart filled with aching pity for her ; he raged secretly because he was so powerless to help her .
"Her girlhood had been blighted , robbed of its meed of happiness and joy ."
Was she likewise to miss her womanhood ?
Alan 's hands clenched involuntarily at the unuttered question .
Once I thought I was stuck for keeps .
Ai n't it an awful night ? '
`` I came to myself and knew I must hurry upstairs .
"I explained as quickly as I could to Mary , and left her trying to brush the snow off ."
"Upstairs I found that Jims was over that paroxysm , but almost as soon as I got back to the room he was in the grip of another ."
"I could n't do anything but moan and cry -- oh , how ashamed I am when I think of it ; and yet what could I do -- we had tried everything we knew -- and then all at once I heard Mary Vance saying loudly behind me , ` Why , that child is dying ! '"
`` I whirled around .
Did n't I know he was dying -- my little Jims !
I could have thrown Mary Vance out of the door or the window -- anywhere -- at that moment .
"There she stood , cool and composed , looking down at my baby , with those , weird white eyes of hers , as she might look at a choking kitten ."
I had always disliked Mary Vance -- and just then I hated her . ''
"` We have tried everything , ' said poor Susan dully ."
` It is not ordinary croup . ' ''
"` No , it 's the dipthery croup , ' said Mary briskly , snatching up an apron ."
` And there 's mighty little time to lose -- but I know what to do .
"When I lived over-harbour with Mrs. Wiley , years ago , Will Crawford 's kid died of dipthery croup , in spite of two doctors ."
"And when old Aunt Christina MacAllister heard of it -- she was the one brought me round when I nearly died of pneumonia you know -- she was a wonder -- no doctor was a patch on her -- they do n't hatch her breed of cats nowadays , let me tell you -- she said she could have saved him with her grandmother 's remedy if she 'd been there ."
She told Mrs. Wiley what it was and I 've never forgot it .
I 've the greatest memory ever -- a thing just lies in the back of my head till the time comes to use it .
"Got any sulphur in the house , Susan ? '"
"`` Yes , we had sulphur ."
"Susan went down with Mary to get it , and I held Jims ."
I had n't any hope -- not the least .
Mary Vance might brag as she liked -- she was always bragging -- but I did n't believe any grandmother 's remedy could save Jims now .
Presently Mary came back .
"She had tied a piece of thick flannel over her mouth and nose , and she carried Susan 's old tin chip pan , half full of burning coals . ''"
"` You watch me , ' she said boastfully ."
"` I 've never done this , but it 's kill or cure that child is dying anyway . '"
"`` She sprinkled a spoonful of sulphur over the coals ; and then she picked up Jims , turned him over , and held him face downward , right over those choking , blinding fumes ."
I do n't know why I did n't spring forward and snatch him away .
"Susan says it was because it was fore-ordained that I should n't , and I think she is right , because it did really seem that I was powerless to move ."
"Susan herself seemed transfixed , watching Mary from the doorway ."
"My voice stuck in my throat , for I ever hated to take part in lies ; but my very embarrassment helped on the plot , for the lass no doubt set down my husky voice to sickness and fatigue ."
`` Has he nae friends ? ''
"said she , in a tearful voice ."
`` That has he so ! ''
"cried Alan , `` if we could but win to them !"
"-- friends and rich friends , beds to lie in , food to eat , doctors to see to him -- and here he must tramp in the dubs and sleep in the heather like a beggarman . ''"
`` And why that ? ''
says the lass .
"`` My dear , '' said Alan , `` I cannae very safely say ; but I 'll tell ye what I 'll do instead , '' says he , `` I 'll whistle ye a bit tune . ''"
"And with that he leaned pretty far over the table , and in a mere breath of a whistle , but with a wonderful pretty sentiment , gave her a few bars of `` Charlie is my darling . ''"
"`` Wheesht , '' says she , and looked over her shoulder to the door ."
"`` That 's it , '' said Alan ."
`` And him so young ! ''
cries the lass .
"`` He 's old enough to -- '' and Alan struck his forefinger on the back part of his neck , meaning that I was old enough to lose my head ."
"`` It would be a black shame , '' she cried , flushing high ."
"`` It 's what will be , though , '' said Alan , `` unless we manage the better . ''"
"At this the lass turned and ran out of that part of the house , leaving us alone together ."
"Alan in high good humour at the furthering of his schemes , and I in bitter dudgeon at being called a Jacobite and treated like a child ."
"`` Alan , '' I cried , `` I can stand no more of this . ''"
"`` Ye 'll have to sit it then , Davie , '' said he ."
"`` For if ye upset the pot now , ye may scrape your own life out of the fire , but Alan Breck is a dead man . ''"
"This was so true that I could only groan ; and even my groan served Alan 's purpose , for it was overheard by the lass as she came flying in again with a dish of white puddings and a bottle of strong ale ."
`` Poor lamb ! ''
"says she , and had no sooner set the meat before us , than she touched me on the shoulder with a little friendly touch , as much as to bid me cheer up ."
"Then she told us to fall to , and there would be no more to pay ; for the inn was her own , or at least her father 's , and he was gone for the day to Pittencrieff ."
"We waited for no second bidding , for bread and cheese is but cold comfort and the puddings smelt excellently well ; and while we sat and ate , she took up that same place by the next table , looking on , and thinking , and frowning to herself , and drawing the string of her apron through her hand ."
"`` I 'm thinking ye have rather a long tongue , '' she said at last to Alan ."
`` Ay '' said Alan ; `` but ye see I ken the folk I speak to . ''
"`` I would never betray ye , '' said she , `` if ye mean that . ''"
"`` No , '' said he , `` ye 're not that kind ."
"But I 'll tell ye what ye would do , ye would help . ''"
We were swept down ; the shot fell thick among us ; I have not seen one man in my own colours since I saw three fall .
"For myself , I came sound to Shoreby , and being mindful of the Black Arrow , got me this gown and bell , and came softly by the path for the Moat House ."
There is no disguise to be compared with it ; the jingle of this bell would scare me the stoutest outlaw in the forest ; they would all turn pale to hear it .
At length I came by you and Matcham .
"I could see but evilly through this same hood , and was not sure of you , being chiefly , and for many a good cause , astonished at the finding you together ."
"Moreover , in the open , where I had to go slowly and tap with my staff , I feared to disclose myself ."
"But see , '' he added , `` this poor shrew begins a little to revive ."
A little good canary will comfort me the heart of it . ''
"The knight , from under his long dress , produced a stout bottle , and began to rub the temples and wet the lips of the patient , who returned gradually to consciousness , and began to roll dim eyes from one to another ."
"`` What cheer , Jack ! ''"
said Dick .
"`` It was no leper , after all ; it was Sir Daniel !"
See ! ''
"`` Swallow me a good draught of this , '' said the knight ."
`` This will give you manhood .
"Thereafter , I will give you both a meal , and we shall all three on to Tunstall ."
"For , Dick , '' he continued , laying forth bread and meat upon the grass , `` I will avow to you , in all good conscience , it irks me sorely to be safe between four walls ."
"Not since I backed a horse have I been pressed so hard ; peril of life , jeopardy of land and livelihood , and to sum up , all these losels in the wood to hunt me down ."
But I be not yet shent .
Some of my lads will pick me their way home .
"Hatch hath ten fellows ; Selden , he had six ."
"Nay , we shall soon be strong again ; and if I can but buy my peace with my right fortunate and undeserving Lord of York , why , Dick , we 'll be a man again and go a-horseback ! ''"
"And so saying , the knight filled himself a horn of canary , and pledged his ward in dumb show ."
"`` Selden , '' Dick faltered -- `` Selden '' -- And he paused again ."
Sir Daniel put down the wine untasted .
`` How ! ''
"he cried , in a changed voice ."
`` Selden ?
Speak !
What of Selden ? ''
Dick stammered forth the tale of the ambush and the massacre .
"The knight heard in silence ; but as he listened , his countenance became convulsed with rage and grief ."
It did not occur to him to wonder why it should please him .
If he had hunted that feeling down he might have been surprised to discover that it had its origin in a curious gratification over the thought that the woman who lived with Lynde had a certain refinement about her .
He preferred her unsmiling dourness to vulgar garrulity .
`` Are you the young minister up at Rexton ? ''
she asked bluntly .
`` Yes . ''
`` I thought so .
Lynde said she had seen you on the shore once .
Well '' -- she cast an uncertain glance over her shoulder at the house -- `` I 'm much obliged to you . ''
"Alan had an idea that that was not what she had thought of saying , but as she had turned aside and was busying herself with the pails , there seemed nothing for him to do but to go ."
`` Wait a moment . ''
"She faced him again , and if Alan had been a vain man he might have thought that admiration looked from her piercing eyes ."
`` What do you think of us ?
I suppose they 've told you tales of us up there ? ''
-- with a scornful gesture of her hand in the direction of Rexton .
`` Do you believe them ? ''
"`` I believe no ill of anyone until I have absolute proof of it , '' said Alan , smiling -- he was quite unconscious what a winning smile he had , which was the best of it -- `` and I never put faith in gossip ."
Of course you are gossipped about -- you know that . ''
"`` Yes , I know it '' -- grimly -- `` and I do n't care what they say about the Captain and me ."
We are a queer pair -- just as queer as they make us out .
"You can believe what you like about us , but do n't you believe a word they say against Lynde ."
She 's sweet and good and beautiful .
It 's not her fault that she never went to church -- it 's her father 's .
Do n't you hold that against her . ''
The fierce yet repressed energy of her tone prevented Alan from feeling any amusement over her simple defence of Lynde .
"Moreover , it sounded unreasonably sweet in his ears ."
"`` I wo n't , '' he promised , `` but I do n't suppose it would matter much to Miss Oliver if I did ."
She did not strike me as a young lady who would worry very much about other people 's opinions . ''
"If his object were to prolong the conversation about Lynde , he was disappointed , for the old woman had turned abruptly to her work again and , though Alan lingered for a few moments longer , she took no further notice of him ."
But when he had gone she peered stealthily after him from the door until he was lost to sight among the pines .
"`` A well-looking man , '' she muttered ."
`` I wish Lynde had been home .
But Ginger 's feelings had been grievously hurt and he rejected all overtures of friendship .
He sat moodily on his perch and ruffled his feathers up until he looked like a mere ball of green and gold .
`` Why do you call him Ginger ? ''
"asked Anne , who liked appropriate names and thought Ginger accorded not at all with such gorgeous plumage ."
`` My brother the sailor named him .
Maybe it had some reference to his temper .
I think a lot of that bird though ... you 'd be surprised if you knew how much .
He has his faults of course .
That bird has cost me a good deal one way and another .
Some people object to his swearing habits but he ca n't be broken of them .
I 've tried ... other people have tried .
Some folks have prejudices against parrots .
"Silly , ai n't it ?"
I like them myself .
Ginger 's a lot of company to me .
"Nothing would induce me to give that bird up ... nothing in the world , miss . ''"
Mr. Harrison flung the last sentence at Anne as explosively as if he suspected her of some latent design of persuading him to give Ginger up .
"Anne , however , was beginning to like the queer , fussy , fidgety little man , and before the meal was over they were quite good friends ."
Mr. Harrison found out about the Improvement Society and was disposed to approve of it .
`` That 's right .
Go ahead .
There 's lots of room for improvement in this settlement ... and in the people too . ''
"`` Oh , I do n't know , '' flashed Anne ."
"To herself , or to her particular cronies , she might admit that there were some small imperfections , easily removable , in Avonlea and its inhabitants ."
But to hear a practical outsider like Mr. Harrison saying it was an entirely different thing .
"`` I think Avonlea is a lovely place ; and the people in it are very nice , too . ''"
"`` I guess you 've got a spice of temper , '' commented Mr. Harrison , surveying the flushed cheeks and indignant eyes opposite him ."
"`` It goes with hair like yours , I reckon ."
Avonlea is a pretty decent place or I would n't have located here ; but I suppose even you will admit that it has SOME faults ? ''
"`` I like it all the better for them , '' said loyal Anne ."
`` I do n't like places or people either that have n't any faults .
I think a truly perfect person would be very uninteresting .
"You remember the Pied Piper -- but no , of course you would n't -- you were too young ."
One evening long ago when Nan and Di and Jem and the Merediths and I were together in Rainbow Valley I had a queer vision or presentiment -- whatever you like to call it .
"Rilla , I saw the Piper coming down the Valley with a shadowy host behind him ."
The others thought I was only pretending -- but I saw him for just one moment .
"And Rilla , last night I saw him again ."
"I was doing sentry-go and I saw him marching across No-man 's - land from our trenches to the German trenches -- the same tall shadowy form , piping weirdly -- and behind him followed boys in khaki ."
"Rilla , I tell you I saw him -- it was no fancy -- no illusion ."
"I heard his music , and then -- he was gone ."
But I had seen him -- and I knew what it meant -- I knew that I was among those who followed him .
"`` Rilla , the Piper will pipe me ` west ' tomorrow ."
I feel sure of this .
"And Rilla , I 'm not afraid ."
"When you hear the news , remember that ."
I 've won my own freedom here -- freedom from all fear .
"I shall never be afraid of anything again -- not of death -- nor of life , if after all , I am to go on living ."
"And life , I think , would be the harder of the two to face -- for it could never be beautiful for me again ."
There would always be such horrible things to remember -- things that would make life ugly and painful always for me .
I could never forget them .
"But whether it 's life or death , I 'm not afraid , Rilla-my-Rilla , and I am not sorry that I came ."
I 'm satisfied .
"I 'll never write the poems I once dreamed of writing -- but I 've helped to make Canada safe for the poets of the future -- for the workers of the future -- ay , and the dreamers , too -- for if no man dreams , there will be nothing for the workers to fulfil -- the future , not of Canada only but of the world -- when the ` red rain ' of Langemarck and Verdun shall have brought forth a golden harvest -- not in a year or two , as some foolishly think , but a generation later , when the seed sown now shall have had time to germinate and grow ."
"Yes , I 'm glad I came , Rilla ."
It is n't only the fate of the little sea-born island I love that is in the balance -- nor of Canada nor of England .
It 's the fate of mankind .
That is what we 're fighting for .
"And we shall win -- never for a moment doubt that , Rilla ."
For it is n't only the living who are fighting -- the dead are fighting too .
Such an army can not be defeated .
"`` Is there laughter in your face yet , Rilla ?"
I hope so .
The world will need laughter and courage more than ever in the years that will come next .
I do n't want to preach -- this is n't any time for it .
Of course this was rather unsatisfactory .
"However , to make amends he showed them how to lie out flat on a strong wind that was going their way , and this was such a pleasant change that they tried it several times and found they could sleep thus with security ."
"Indeed they would have slept longer , but Peter tired quickly of sleeping , and soon he would cry in his captain voice , ` We get off here . '"
"So with occasional tiffs , but on the whole rollicking , they drew near the Neverland ; for after many moons they did reach it , and , what is more , they had been going pretty straight all the time , not perhaps so much owing to the guidance of Peter or Tink as because the island was out looking for them ."
It is only thus that any one may sight those magic shores .
"` There it is , ' said Peter calmly ."
"` Where , where ? '"
` Where all the arrows are pointing . '
"Indeed a million golden arrows were pointing out the island to the children , all directed by their friend the sun , who wanted them to be sure of their way before leaving them for the night ."
-LSB- Illustration : `` LET HIM KEEP WHO CAN '' -RSB- Wendy and John and Michael stood on tiptoe in the air to get their first sight of the island .
"Strange to say , they all recognised it at once , and until fear fell upon them they hailed it , not as something long dreamt of and seen at last , but as a familiar friend to whom they were returning home for the holidays ."
"` John , there 's the lagoon . '"
"` Wendy , look at the turtles burying their eggs in the sand . ' '"
"I say , John , I see your flamingo with the broken leg . '"
"` Look , Michael , there 's your cave . '"
"` John , what 's that in the brushwood ? '"
` It 's a wolf with her whelps .
"Wendy , I do believe that 's your little whelp . '"
"` There 's my boat , John , with her sides stove in . '"
"` No , it is n't ."
"Why , we burned your boat . '"
"` That 's her , at any rate ."
"I say , John , I see the smoke of the redskin camp . '"
` Where ?
"Show me , and I 'll tell you by the way the smoke curls whether they are on the war-path . '"
"` There , just across the Mysterious River . ' '"
I see now .
"Yes , they are on the war-path right enough . '"
"Peter was a little annoyed with them for knowing so much ; but if he wanted to lord it over them his triumph was at hand , for have I not told you that anon fear fell upon them ?"
"It came as the arrows went , leaving the island in gloom ."
In the old days at home the Neverland had always begun to look a little dark and threatening by bedtime .
"Then unexplored patches arose in it and spread ; black shadows moved about in them ; the roar of the beasts of prey was quite different now , and above all , you lost the certainty that you would win ."
"The window was wide open , just as he knew it would be , and in he fluttered , and there was his mother lying asleep ."
Peter alighted softly on the wooden rail at the foot of the bed and had a good look at her .
"She lay with her head on her hand , and the hollow in the pillow was like a nest lined with her brown wavy hair ."
"He remembered , though he had long forgotten it , that she always gave her hair a holiday at night ."
How sweet the frills of her nightgown were !
He was very glad she was such a pretty mother .
"But she looked sad , and he knew why she looked sad ."
"One of her arms moved as if it wanted to go round something , and he knew what it wanted to go round . '"
O mother ! '
"said Peter to himself , ` if you just knew who is sitting on the rail at the foot of the bed . '"
"Very gently he patted the little mound that her feet made , and he could see by her face that she liked it ."
"He knew he had but to say ` Mother ' ever so softly , and she would wake up ."
They always wake up at once if it is you that says their name .
Then she would give such a joyous cry and squeeze him tight .
"How nice that would be to him , but oh !"
how exquisitely delicious it would be to her .
"That , I am afraid , is how Peter regarded it ."
In returning to his mother he never doubted that he was giving her the greatest treat a woman can have .
"Nothing can be more splendid , he thought , than to have a little boy of your own ."
How proud of him they are !
"and very right and proper , too ."
"-LSB- Illustration : The fairies sit round on mushrooms , and at first they are well behaved -RSB- But why does Peter sit so long on the rail ; why does he not tell his mother that he has come back ?"
"I quite shrink from the truth , which is that he sat there in two minds ."
"Sometimes he looked longingly at his mother , and sometimes he looked longingly at the window ."
"Certainly it would be pleasant to be her boy again , but on the other hand , what times those had been in the Gardens !"
Was he so sure that he should enjoy wearing clothes again ?
He popped off the bed and opened some drawers to have a look at his old garments .
"They were still there , but he could not remember how you put them on ."
"The socks , for instance , were they worn on the hands or on the feet ?"
"He was about to try one of them on his hand , when he had a great adventure ."
"Perhaps the drawer had creaked ; at any rate , his mother woke up , for he heard her say ` Peter , ' as if it was the most lovely word in the language ."
"He remained sitting on the floor and held his breath , wondering how she knew that he had come back ."
"Laddie was a handsome and intelligent black-and-white Newfoundland , with a magnificent coat ."
He and Ernest were great chums .
I felt sorry for the boy who was to lose his pet .
"`` Do n't take it so hard , Ern , '' I said , trying to comfort him ."
`` Uncle will likely get another pup . ''
`` I do n't want any other pup ! ''
Ernest blurted out .
"`` Oh , Ned , wo n't you try and coax your uncle not to sell him ?"
Perhaps he 'd listen to you . ''
I shook my head .
I knew Uncle Richard too well to hope that .
"`` Not in this case , Ern , '' I said ."
"`` He would say it did not concern me , and you know nothing moves him when he determines on a thing ."
"You 'll have to reconcile yourself to losing Laddie , I 'm afraid . ''"
"Ernest 's tow-coloured head went down on Laddie 's neck again , and I , deciding that there was no use in saying anything more , proceeded towards the shore , which was about a mile from Uncle Richard 's house ."
"The beach along his farm and for several farms along shore was a lonely , untenanted one , for the fisher-folk all lived two miles further down , at Rowley 's Cove ."
About three hundred yards from the shore was the peculiar formation known as Island Rock .
This was a large rock that stood abruptly up out of the water .
"Below , about the usual water-line , it was seamed and fissured , but its summit rose up in a narrow , flat-topped peak ."
"At low tide twenty feet of it was above water , but at high tide it was six feet and often more under water ."
I pushed Uncle Richard 's small flat down the rough path and rowed out to Island Rock .
"Arriving there , I thrust the painter deep into a narrow cleft ."
"This was the usual way of mooring it , and no doubt of its safety occurred to me ."
"I scrambled up the rock and around to the eastern end , where there was a broader space for standing and from which some capital views could be obtained ."
"The sea about the rock was calm , but there was quite a swell on and an off-shore breeze was blowing ."
There were no boats visible .
"The tide was low , leaving bare the curious caves and headlands along shore , and I secured a number of excellent snapshots ."
It was now three o'clock .
"I must wait another hour yet before I could get the best view of the `` Hole in the Wall '' -- a huge , arch-like opening through a jutting headland to the west of me ."
"I went around to look at it , when I saw a sight that made me stop short in dismay ."
"This was nothing less than the flat , drifting outward around the point ."
The swell and suction of the water around the rock must have pulled her loose -- and I was a prisoner !
"said I , waving my cap ."
`` And there 's an end to Captain Silver ! ''
"He watched me keenly and slyly , his chin all the while on his breast ."
"`` I reckon , '' he said at last , `` I reckon , Cap'n Hawkins , you 'll kind of want to get ashore now ."
S'pose we talks . ''
"`` Why , yes , '' says I , `` with all my heart , Mr. Hands ."
Say on . ''
And I went back to my meal with a good appetite .
"`` This man , '' he began , nodding feebly at the corpse '' -- O'Brien were his name , a rank Irelander -- this man and me got the canvas on her , meaning for to sail her back ."
"Well , HE 'S dead now , he is -- as dead as bilge ; and who 's to sail this ship , I do n't see ."
"Without I gives you a hint , you ai n't that man , as far 's I can tell ."
"Now , look here , you gives me food and drink and a old scarf or ankecher to tie my wound up , you do , and I 'll tell you how to sail her , and that 's about square all round , I take it . ''"
"`` I 'll tell you one thing , '' says I : `` I 'm not going back to Captain Kidd 's anchorage ."
I mean to get into North Inlet and beach her quietly there . ''
"`` To be sure you did , '' he cried ."
"`` Why , I ai n't sich an infernal lubber after all ."
"I can see , ca n't I ?"
"I 've tried my fling , I have , and I 've lost , and it 's you has the wind of me ."
North Inlet ?
"Why , I have n't no ch ` ice , not I !"
"I 'd help you sail her up to Execution Dock , by thunder !"
So I would . ''
"Well , as it seemed to me , there was some sense in this ."
We struck our bargain on the spot .
"In three minutes I had the HISPANIOLA sailing easily before the wind along the coast of Treasure Island , with good hopes of turning the northern point ere noon and beating down again as far as North Inlet before high water , when we might beach her safely and wait till the subsiding tide permitted us to land ."
"Then I lashed the tiller and went below to my own chest , where I got a soft silk handkerchief of my mother 's ."
"With this , and with my aid , Hands bound up the great bleeding stab he had received in the thigh , and after he had eaten a little and had a swallow or two more of the brandy , he began to pick up visibly , sat straighter up , spoke louder and clearer , and looked in every way another man ."
The breeze served us admirably .
"We skimmed before it like a bird , the coast of the island flashing by and the view changing every minute ."
"Soon we were past the high lands and bowling beside low , sandy country , sparsely dotted with dwarf pines , and soon we were beyond that again and had turned the corner of the rocky hill that ends the island on the north ."
"I was greatly elated with my new command , and pleased with the bright , sunshiny weather and these different prospects of the coast ."
"I had now plenty of water and good things to eat , and my conscience , which had smitten me hard for my desertion , was quieted by the great conquest I had made ."
"For all that , if ye have any affection for my neck -LRB- to say nothing of your own -RRB- ye will perhaps be kind enough to take this matter responsibly ."
"I am going to do a bit of play-acting , the bottom ground of which is just exactly as serious as the gallows for the pair of us ."
"So bear it , if ye please , in mind , and conduct yourself according . ''"
"`` Well , well , '' said I , `` have it as you will . ''"
"As we got near the clachan , he made me take his arm and hang upon it like one almost helpless with weariness ; and by the time he pushed open the change-house door , he seemed to be half carrying me ."
"The maid appeared surprised -LRB- as well she might be -RRB- at our speedy return ; but Alan had no words to spare for her in explanation , helped me to a chair , called for a tass of brandy with which he fed me in little sips , and then breaking up the bread and cheese helped me to eat it like a nursery-lass ; the whole with that grave , concerned , affectionate countenance , that might have imposed upon a judge ."
"It was small wonder if the maid were taken with the picture we presented , of a poor , sick , overwrought lad and his most tender comrade ."
"She drew quite near , and stood leaning with her back on the next table ."
`` What 's like wrong with him ? ''
said she at last .
"Alan turned upon her , to my great wonder , with a kind of fury ."
`` Wrong ? ''
cries he .
"`` He 's walked more hundreds of miles than he has hairs upon his chin , and slept oftener in wet heather than dry sheets ."
"Wrong , quo ' she !"
"Wrong enough , I would think !"
"Wrong , indeed ! ''"
"and he kept grumbling to himself as he fed me , like a man ill-pleased ."
"`` He 's young for the like of that , '' said the maid ."
"`` Ower young , '' said Alan , with his back to her ."
"`` He would be better riding , '' says she ."
`` And where could I get a horse to him ? ''
"cried Alan , turning on her with the same appearance of fury ."
`` Would ye have me steal ? ''
"I thought this roughness would have sent her off in dudgeon , as indeed it closed her mouth for the time ."
"But my companion knew very well what he was doing ; and for as simple as he was in some things of life , had a great fund of roguishness in such affairs as these ."
"`` Ye neednae tell me , '' she said at last -- `` ye 're gentry . ''"
"`` Well , '' said Alan , softened a little -LRB- I believe against his will -RRB- by this artless comment , `` and suppose we were ?"
Did ever you hear that gentrice put money in folk 's pockets ? ''
"She sighed at this , as if she were herself some disinherited great lady ."
"`` No , '' says she , `` that 's true indeed . ''"
"I was all this while chafing at the part I played , and sitting tongue-tied between shame and merriment ; but somehow at this I could hold in no longer , and bade Alan let me be , for I was better already ."
"Alan Douglas was a sincere man , with himself as well as with others , yet there are some motives that lie , in their first inception , too deep even for the probe of self-analysis ."
He had not as yet the faintest suspicion as to the real source of his interest in Lynde Oliver -- in his sudden forceful desire to be of use and service to her -- to rescue her from spiritual peril as he had that day rescued her from bodily danger .
"She must have a lonely , unsatisfying life , he thought ."
It is my duty to help her if I can .
It did not then occur to him that duty in this instance wore a much more pleasing aspect than it had sometimes worn in his experience .
"* * * * * Alan did not mean to be oversoon in going back to Four Winds , but three days later a book came to him which Captain Anthony had expressed a wish to see ."
It furnished an excuse for an earlier call .
After that he went often .
"He always found the Captain courteous and affable , old Emily grimly cordial , Lynde sometimes remote and demure , sometimes frankly friendly ."
"Occasionally , when the Captain was away in his yacht , he went for a walk with her and her dogs along the shore or through the sweet-smelling pinelands up the lake ."
He found that she loved books and was avid for more of them than she could obtain ; he was glad to take her several and discuss them with her .
She liked history and travels best .
"With novels she had no patience , she said disdainfully ."
She seldom spoke of herself or her past life and Alan fancied she avoided any personal reference .
"But once she said abruptly , `` Why do you never ask me to go to church ?"
I 've always been afraid you would . ''
"`` Because I do not think it would do you any good to go if you did n't want to , '' said Alan gravely ."
`` Souls should not be rudely handled any more than bodies . ''
"She looked at him reflectively , her finger denting her chin in a meditative fashion she had ."
`` You are not at all like Mr. Strong .
"He always scolded me , when he got a chance , for not going to church ."
I would have hated him if it had been worthwhile .
I told him one day that I was nearer to God under these pines than I could be in any building fashioned by human hands .
He was very much shocked .
But I do n't want you to misunderstand me .
Father does not go to church because he does not believe there is a God .
But I know there is .
Mother taught me so .
"I have never gone to church because Father would not allow me , and I could not go now in Rexton where the people talk about me so ."
"Oh , I know they do -- you know it , too -- but I do not care for them ."
I know I 'm not like other girls .
I would like to be but I ca n't be -- I never can be -- now . ''
Never to feel that perhaps her eyes rested on him now and then as he went about his work in the valley fields !
Never to stoop with a glad thrill over the first spring flowers because it was his privilege to take them to her !
Jeffrey groaned aloud .
"No , he could not go up to see her that night ; he must wait -- he must strengthen himself ."
Then his heart rebuked him .
This was selfishness ; this was putting his own feelings before hers -- a thing he had sworn never to do .
Perhaps she needed him -- perhaps she had wondered why he had not come to offer her such poor service as might be in his power .
"He turned and went down through the orchard lane , taking the old field-path across the valley and up the hill , which he had traversed so often and so joyfully in boyhood ."
"It was dark now , and a few stars were shining in the silvery sky ."
The wind sighed among the pines as he walked under them .
Sometimes he felt that he must turn back -- that his pain was going to master him ; then he forced himself to go on .
"The old grey house where Sara lived seemed bleak and stricken in the dull light , with its leafless vines clinging to it ."
There were no lights in it .
It looked like a home left soulless .
Jeffrey went around to the garden door and knocked .
"He had expected the maid to open it , put Sara herself came ."
"`` Why , Jeff , '' she said , with pleasure in her tones ."
`` I am so glad to see you .
I have been wondering why you had not come before . ''
"`` I did not think you would want to see me yet , '' he said hurriedly ."
`` I have thought about you every hour -- but I feared to intrude . '' ''
"You could n't intrude , '' she said gently ."
"`` Yes , I have wanted to see you , Jeff ."
Come into the library . ''
He followed her into the room where they had always sat in his rare calls .
Sara lighted the lamp on the table .
"As the light shot up she stood clearly revealed in it -- a tall , slender woman in a trailing gown of grey ."
"Even a stranger , not knowing her age , would have guessed it to be what it was , yet it would have been hard to say what gave the impression of maturity ."
"Her face was quite unlined -- a little pale , perhaps , with more finely cut outlines than those of youth ."
"Her eyes were clear and bright ; her abundant brown hair waved back from her face in the same curves that Jeffrey had noted in the purple-gowned child of six , under the pines ."
Perhaps it was the fine patience and serenity in her face that told her tale of years .
Youth can never acquire it .
Richard of Gloucester flushed .
"`` Mark it right well , '' he said , harshly ."
"`` I love not mercy , nor yet mercymongers ."
Ye have this day laid the foundations of high fortune .
"If ye oppose to me my word , which I have plighted , I will yield ."
"But , by the glory of heaven , there your favour dies !"
"`` Mine is the loss , '' said Dick ."
"`` Give him his sailor , '' said the duke ; and wheeling his horse , he turned his back upon young Shelton ."
Dick was nor glad nor sorry .
He had seen too much of the young duke to set great store on his affection ; and the origin and growth of his own favour had been too flimsy and too rapid to inspire much confidence .
One thing alone he feared -- that the vindictive leader might revoke the offer of the lances .
"But here he did justice neither to Gloucester 's honour -LRB- such as it was -RRB- nor , above all , to his decision ."
"If he had once judged Dick to be the right man to pursue Sir Daniel , he was not one to change ; and he soon proved it by shouting after Catesby to be speedy , for the paladin was waiting ."
"In the meanwhile , Dick turned to the old shipman , who had seemed equally indifferent to his condemnation and to his subsequent release ."
"`` Arblaster , '' said Dick , `` I have done you ill ; but now , by the rood , I think I have cleared the score . ''"
But the old skipper only looked upon him dully and held his peace .
"`` Come , '' continued Dick , `` a life is a life , old shrew , and it is more than ships or liquor ."
"Say ye forgive me ; for if your life be worth nothing to you , it hath cost me the beginnings of my fortune ."
"Come , I have paid for it dearly ; be not so churlish . ''"
"`` An I had had my ship , '' said Arblaster , `` I would ` a ' been forth and safe on the high seas -- I and my man Tom ."
"But ye took my ship , gossip , and I 'm a beggar ; and for my man Tom , a knave fellow in russet shot him down ."
` Murrain ! '
"quoth he , and spake never again ."
"` Murrain ' was the last of his words , and the poor spirit of him passed . '"
"A will never sail no more , will my Tom . ' ''"
"Dick was seized with unavailing penitence and pity ; he sought to take the skipper 's hand , but Arblaster avoided his touch ."
"`` Nay , '' said he , `` let be ."
"Y ' have played the devil with me , and let that content you . ''"
The words died in Richard 's throat .
"He saw , through tears , the poor old man , bemused with liquor and sorrow , go shambling away , with bowed head , across the snow , and the unnoticed dog whimpering at his heels , and for the first time began to understand the desperate game that we play in life ; and how a thing once done is not to be changed or remedied , by any penitence ."
But there was no time left to him for vain regret .
"Catesby had now collected the horsemen , and riding up to Dick he dismounted , and offered him his own horse ."
"He could sleep in the air without falling , by merely lying on his back and floating , but this was , partly at least , because he was so light that if you got behind him and blew he went faster ."
"` Do be more polite to him , ' Wendy whispered to John , when they were playing ` Follow my Leader . '"
"` Then tell him to stop showing off , ' said John ."
"When playing Follow my Leader , Peter would fly close to the water and touch each shark 's tail in passing , just as in the street you may run your finger along an iron railing ."
"They could not follow him in this with much success , so perhaps it was rather like showing off , especially as he kept looking behind to see how many tails they missed ."
"` You must be nice to him , ' Wendy impressed on her brothers ."
` What could we do if he were to leave us ? '
"` We could go back , ' Michael said ."
` How could we ever find our way back without him ? '
"` Well , then , we could go on , ' said John ."
"` That is the awful thing , John ."
"We should have to go on , for we do n't know how to stop . '"
This was true ; Peter had forgotten to show them how to stop .
"John said that if the worst came to the worst , all they had to do was to go straight on , for the world was round , and so in time they must come back to their own window ."
"` And who is to get food for us , John ? ' '"
"I nipped a bit out of that eagle 's mouth pretty neatly , Wendy . '"
"` After the twentieth try , ' Wendy reminded him ."
"` And even though we became good at picking up food , see how we bump against clouds and things if he is not near to give us a hand . '"
Indeed they were constantly bumping .
"They could now fly strongly , though they still kicked far too much ; but if they saw a cloud in front of them , the more they tried to avoid it , the more certainly did they bump into it ."
"If Nana had been with them , she would have had a bandage round Michael 's forehead by this time ."
"Peter was not with them for the moment , and they felt rather lonely up there by themselves ."
"He could go so much faster than they that he would suddenly shoot out of sight , to have some adventure in which they had no share ."
"He would come down laughing over something fearfully funny he had been saying to a star , but he had already forgotten what it was , or he would come up with mermaid scales still sticking to him , and yet not be able to say for certain what had been happening ."
It was really rather irritating to children who had never seen a mermaid .
"` And if he forgets them , so quickly , ' Wendy argued , ` how can we expect that he will go on remembering us ? '"
"Indeed , sometimes when he returned he did not remember them , at least not well ."
Wendy was sure of it .
She saw recognition come into his eyes as he was about to pass them the time of day and go on ; once even she had to tell him her name .
"` I 'm Wendy , ' she said agitatedly ."
He was very sorry . '
"I say , Wendy , ' he whispered to her , ` always if you see me forgetting you , just keep on saying `` I 'm Wendy , '' and then I 'll remember . '"
"` It will be quite easy to get the king to send my brother in search of her , and if he returns without finding her , his head will be the forfeit ."
"Either way , he will be out of MY path . '"
"So he went at once to the Lord High Chamberlain and craved an audience of the king , to whom he declared he wished to tell some news of the highest importance ."
"The king admitted him into the presence chamber without delay , and bade him state what he had to say , and to be quick about it ."
"` Oh , sire !"
"the Princess Bella-Flor -- ' answered the man , and then stopped as if afraid ."
` What of the Princess Bella-Flor ? '
asked the king impatiently . '
I have heard -- it is whispered at court -- that your majesty desires to know where she lies in hiding . ' '
"I would give half my kingdom to the man who will bring her to me , ' cried the king , eagerly ."
"` Speak on , knave ; has a bird of the air revealed to you the secret ? '"
"` It is not I , but my brother , who knows , ' replied the traitor ; ` if your majesty would ask him -- ' But before the words were out of his mouth the king had struck a blow with his sceptre on a golden plate that hung on the wall ."
"` Order Jose to appear before me instantly , ' he shouted to the servant who ran to obey his orders , so great was the noise his majesty had made ; and when Jose entered the hall , wondering what in the world could be the matter , the king was nearly dumb from rage and excitement ."
"` Bring me the Princess Bella-Flor this moment , ' stammered he , ` for if you return without her I will have you drowned ! '"
"And without another word he left the hall , leaving Jose staring with surprise and horror ."
` How can I find the Princess Bella-Flor when I have never even seen her ? '
thought he .
"` But it is no use staying here , for I shall only be put to death . '"
And he walked slowly to the stables to choose himself a horse .
"There were rows upon rows of fine beasts with their names written in gold above their stalls , and Jose was looking uncertainly from one to the other , wondering which he should choose , when an old white horse turned its head and signed to him to approach ."
"` Take me , ' it said in a gentle whisper , ` and all will go well . '"
Jose still felt so bewildered with the mission that the king had given him that he forgot to be astonished at hearing a horse talk .
Mechanically he laid his hand on the bridle and led the white horse out of the stable .
"He was about to mount on his back , when the animal spoke again : ` Pick up those three loaves of bread which you see there , and put them in your pocket . '"
"Jose did as he was told , and being in a great hurry to get away , asked no questions , but swung himself into the saddle ."
"They rode far without meeting any adventures , but at length they came to an ant-hill , and the horse stopped ."
"` Crumble those three loaves for the ants , ' he said ."
But Jose hesitated .
"` Why , we may want them ourselves ! '"
answered he .
` Never mind that ; give them to the ants all the same .
Do not lose a chance of helping others . '
"Those who had dismounted began scrambling into the saddle ; the rest rode in pursuit ; but they had to make the circuit of the consecrated ground , and it was plain their quarry would escape them ."
"Hatch , roaring an oath , put his horse at the hedge , to head him off ; but the beast refused , and sent his rider sprawling in the dust ."
"And though he was up again in a moment , and had caught the bridle , the time had gone by , and the fugitive had gained too great a lead for any hope of capture ."
The wisest of all had been Dick Shelton .
"Instead of starting in a vain pursuit , he had whipped his crossbow from his back , bent it , and set a quarrel to the string ; and now , when the others had desisted , he turned to Bennet and asked if he should shoot ."
`` Shoot !
shoot ! ''
"cried the priest , with sanguinary violence ."
"`` Cover him , Master Dick , '' said Bennet ."
`` Bring me him down like a ripe apple . ''
The fugitive was now within but a few leaps of safety ; but this last part of the meadow ran very steeply uphill ; and the man ran slower in proportion .
"What with the greyness of the falling night , and the uneven movements of the runner , it was no easy aim ; and as Dick levelled his bow , he felt a kind of pity , and a half desire that he might miss ."
The quarrel sped .
"The man stumbled and fell , and a great cheer arose from Hatch and the pursuers ."
But they were counting their corn before the harvest .
"The man fell lightly ; he was lightly afoot again , turned and waved his cap in a bravado , and was out of sight next moment in the margin of the wood ."
`` And the plague go with him ! ''
cried Bennet .
"`` He has thieves ' heels ; he can run , by St Banbury !"
"But you touched him , Master Shelton ; he has stolen your quarrel , may he never have good I grudge him less ! ''"
"`` Nay , but what made he by the church ? ''"
asked Sir Oliver .
`` I am shrewdly afeared there has been mischief here .
"Clipsby , good fellow , get ye down from your horse , and search thoroughly among the yews . ''"
Clipsby was gone but a little while ere he returned carrying a paper .
"`` This writing was pinned to the church door , '' he said , handing it to the parson ."
"`` I found naught else , sir parson . ''"
"`` Now , by the power of Mother Church , '' cried Sir Oliver , `` but this runs hard on sacrilege !"
"For the king 's good pleasure , or the lord of the manor -- well !"
"But that every run-the-hedge in a green jerkin should fasten papers to the chancel door -- nay , it runs hard on sacrilege , hard ; and men have burned for matters of less weight ."
But what have we here ?
The light falls apace .
"No captain , sir , would be justified in going to sea at all if he had ground enough to say that ."
"As for Mr. Arrow , I believe him thoroughly honest ; some of the men are the same ; all may be for what I know ."
But I am responsible for the ship 's safety and the life of every man Jack aboard of her .
"I see things going , as I think , not quite right ."
And I ask you to take certain precautions or let me resign my berth .
And that 's all . ''
"`` Captain Smollett , '' began the doctor with a smile , `` did ever you hear the fable of the mountain and the mouse ?"
"You 'll excuse me , I dare say , but you remind me of that fable ."
"When you came in here , I 'll stake my wig , you meant more than this . ''"
"`` Doctor , '' said the captain , `` you are smart ."
When I came in here I meant to get discharged .
I had no thought that Mr. Trelawney would hear a word . ''
"`` No more I would , '' cried the squire ."
`` Had Livesey not been here I should have seen you to the deuce .
"As it is , I have heard you ."
"I will do as you desire , but I think the worse of you . ''"
"`` That 's as you please , sir , '' said the captain ."
`` You 'll find I do my duty . ''
And with that he took his leave .
"`` Trelawney , '' said the doctor , `` contrary to all my notions , I believed you have managed to get two honest men on board with you -- that man and John Silver . ''"
"`` Silver , if you like , '' cried the squire ; `` but as for that intolerable humbug , I declare I think his conduct unmanly , unsailorly , and downright un-English . ''"
"`` Well , '' says the doctor , `` we shall see . ''"
"When we came on deck , the men had begun already to take out the arms and powder , yo-ho-ing at their work , while the captain and Mr. Arrow stood by superintending ."
The new arrangement was quite to my liking .
The whole schooner had been overhauled ; six berths had been made astern out of what had been the after-part of the main hold ; and this set of cabins was only joined to the galley and forecastle by a sparred passage on the port side .
"It had been originally meant that the captain , Mr. Arrow , Hunter , Joyce , the doctor , and the squire were to occupy these six berths ."
"Now Redruth and I were to get two of them and Mr. Arrow and the captain were to sleep on deck in the companion , which had been enlarged on each side till you might almost have called it a round-house ."
"Very low it was still , of course ; but there was room to swing two hammocks , and even the mate seemed pleased with the arrangement ."
"Even he , perhaps , had been doubtful as to the crew , but that is only guess , for as you shall hear , we had not long the benefit of his opinion ."
"We were all hard at work , changing the powder and the berths , when the last man or two , and Long John along with them , came off in a shore-boat ."
"The cook came up the side like a monkey for cleverness , and as soon as he saw what was doing , `` So ho , mates ! ''"
says he .
The pace was deadly : my heart seemed bursting against my ribs ; and I had neither time to think nor breath to speak with .
"Only I remember seeing with wonder , that Alan every now and then would straighten himself to his full height and look back ; and every time he did so , there came a great far-away cheering and crying of the soldiers ."
"Quarter of an hour later , Alan stopped , clapped down flat in the heather , and turned to me ."
"`` Now , '' said he , `` it 's earnest ."
"Do as I do , for your life . ''"
"And at the same speed , but now with infinitely more precaution , we traced back again across the mountain-side by the same way that we had come , only perhaps higher ; till at last Alan threw himself down in the upper wood of Lettermore , where I had found him at the first , and lay , with his face in the bracken , panting like a dog ."
"My own sides so ached , my head so swam , my tongue so hung out of my mouth with heat and dryness , that I lay beside him like one dead ."
CHAPTER XVIII I TALK WITH ALAN IN THE WOOD OF LETTERMORE Alan was the first to come round .
"He rose , went to the border of the wood , peered out a little , and then returned and sat down ."
"`` Well , '' said he , `` yon was a hot burst , David . ''"
"I said nothing , nor so much as lifted my face ."
"I had seen murder done , and a great , ruddy , jovial gentleman struck out of life in a moment ; the pity of that sight was still sore within me , and yet that was but a part of my concern ."
"Here was murder done upon the man Alan hated ; here was Alan skulking in the trees and running from the troops ; and whether his was the hand that fired or only the head that ordered , signified but little ."
"By my way of it , my only friend in that wild country was blood-guilty in the first degree ; I held him in horror ; I could not look upon his face ; I would have rather lain alone in the rain on my cold isle , than in that warm wood beside a murderer ."
`` Are ye still wearied ? ''
he asked again .
"`` No , '' said I , still with my face in the bracken ; `` no , I am not wearied now , and I can speak ."
"You and me must twine , '' * I said ."
"`` I liked you very well , Alan , but your ways are not mine , and they 're not God 's : and the short and the long of it is just that we must twine . ''"
* Part .
"`` I will hardly twine from ye , David , without some kind of reason for the same , '' said Alan , mighty gravely ."
"`` If ye ken anything against my reputation , it 's the least thing that ye should do , for old acquaintance ' sake , to let me hear the name of it ; and if ye have only taken a distaste to my society , it will be proper for me to judge if I 'm insulted . ''"
"`` Alan , '' said I , `` what is the sense of this ?"
Ye ken very well yon Campbell-man lies in his blood upon the road . ''
"He was silent for a little ; then says he , `` Did ever ye hear tell of the story of the Man and the Good People ? ''"
-- by which he meant the fairies .
"`` No , '' said I , `` nor do I want to hear it . ''"
"`` With your permission , Mr. Balfour , I will tell it you , whatever , '' says Alan ."
"`` The man , ye should ken , was cast upon a rock in the sea , where it appears the Good People were in use to come and rest as they went through to Ireland ."
"The name of this rock is called the Skerryvore , and it 's not far from where we suffered ship-wreck ."
"Well , it seems the man cried so sore , if he could just see his little bairn before he died !"
"that at last the king of the Good People took peety upon him , and sent one flying that brought back the bairn in a poke * and laid it down beside the man where he lay sleeping ."
"One place suits one person, another place suits another person. For my part I prefer to live in the country, like Timmy Willie."
The Little Red Hen
"A Little Red Hen lived in a barnyard. She spent almost all of her time walking about the barnyard in her picketty-pecketty fashion, scratching everywhere for worms."
"She dearly loved fat, delicious worms and felt they were absolutely necessary to the health of her children. As often as she found a worm she would call ""Chuck-chuck-chuck!"" to her chickies."
"When they were gathered about her, she would distribute choice morsels of her tid-bit. A busy little body was she!"
"A cat usually napped lazily in the barn door, not even bothering herself to scare the rat who ran here and there as he pleased. And as for the pig who lived in the sty he did not care what happened so long as he could eat and grow fat."
"One day the Little Red Hen found a Seed. It was a Wheat Seed, but the Little Red Hen was so accustomed to bugs and worms that she supposed this to be some new and perhaps very delicious kind of meat. She bit it gently and found that it resembled a worm in no way whatsoever as to taste although because it was long and slender, a Little Red Hen might easily be fooled by its appearance."
"Carrying it about, she made many inquiries as to what it might be. She found it was a Wheat Seed and that, if planted, it would grow up and when ripe it could be made into flour and then into bread."
"When she discovered that, she knew it ought to be planted. She was so busy hunting food for herself and her family that, naturally, she thought she ought not to take time to plant it."
"So she thought of the Pig upon whom time must hang heavily and of the Cat who had nothing to do, and of the great fat Rat with his idle hours, and she called loudly:"
"""Who will plant the Seed?"""
"But the Pig said, ""Not I,"" and the Cat said, ""Not I,"" and the Rat said, ""Not I."""
"""Well, then,"" said the Little Red Hen, ""I will."""
And she did.
"Then she went on with her daily duties through the long summer days, scratching for worms and feeding her chicks, while the Pig grew fat, and the Cat grew fat, and the Rat grew fat, and the Wheat grew tall and ready for harvest."
"So one day the Little Red Hen chanced to notice how large the Wheat was and that the grain was ripe, so she ran about calling briskly:"
"""Who will cut the Wheat?"""
"The Pig said, ""Not I,"" the Cat said, ""Not I,"" and the Rat said, ""Not I."""
"""Well, then,"" said the Little Red Hen, ""I will."""
And she did.
She got the sickle from among the farmer's tools in the barn and proceeded to cut off all of the big plant of Wheat.
"On the ground lay the nicely cut Wheat, ready to be gathered and threshed, but the newest and yellowest and downiest of Mrs. Hen's chicks set up a ""peep-peep-peeping"" in their most vigorous fashion, proclaiming to the world at large, but most particularly to their mother, that she was neglecting them."
Poor Little Red Hen! She felt quite bewildered and hardly knew where to turn.
"Her attention was sorely divided between her duty to her children and her duty to the Wheat, for which she felt responsible."
"So, again, in a very hopeful tone, she called out, ""Who will thresh the Wheat?"""
"But the Pig, with a grunt, said, ""Not I,"""
"and the Cat, with a meow, said, ""Not I,"" and the Rat, with a squeak, said, ""Not I."""
"So the Little Red Hen, looking, it must be admitted, rather discouraged, said, ""Well, I will, then."""
And she did.
"Of course, she had to feed her babies first, though, and when she had gotten them all to sleep for their afternoon nap, she went out and threshed the Wheat. Then she called out: ""Who will carry the Wheat to the mill to be ground?"""
"So, when the Lad woke, he took his cloth and went off with it, and that day he got home to his mother."
"""Now,"" said he, ""I've been to the North Wind's house, and a good fellow he is, for he gave me this cloth, and when I only say to it, 'Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of good dishes,' I get any sort of food I please."""
"""All very true, I daresay,"" said his mother; ""but seeing is believing, and I shan't believe it till I see it."""
"So the Lad made haste, drew out a table, laid the cloth on it, and said:"
"""Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of good dishes."""
But never a bit of dry bread did the cloth serve up.
"""Well,"" said the Lad ""there's no help for it but to go to the North Wind again;"" and away he went."
So he came to where the North Wind lived late in the afternoon.
"""Good evening!"" said the Lad."
"""Good evening!"" said the North Wind."
"""I want my rights for that meal of ours which you took,"" said the Lad; ""for, as for that cloth I got, it isn't worth a penny."""
"""I've got no meal,"" said the North Wind; ""but yonder you have a ram which coins nothing but golden ducats as soon as you say to it: 'Ram, ram! make money!'"""
"So the Lad thought this a fine thing; but as it was too far to get home that day, he turned in for the night to the same inn where he had slept before."
"Before he called for anything, he tried the truth of what the North Wind had said of the ram, and found it all right; but, when the landlord saw that, he thought it was a famous ram, and, when the Lad had fallen asleep, he took another which couldn't coin gold ducats, and changed the two."
"Next morning off went the Lad; and when he got home to his mother, he said:"
"""After all, the North Wind is a jolly fellow; for now he has given me a ram which can coin golden ducats if I only say: 'Ram, ram! make money!'"""
"""All very true, I daresay,"" said his mother; ""but I shan't believe any such stuff until I see the ducats made."""
"""Ram, ram! make money!"" said the Lad; but if the ram made anything, it wasn't money."
"So the Lad went back again to the North Wind, and blew him up, and said the ram was worth nothing, and he must have his rights for the meal."
"""Well!"" said the North Wind; ""I've nothing else to give you but that old stick in the corner yonder; but its a stick of that kind that if you say: 'Stick, stick! lay on!' it lays on till you say: 'Stick, stick! now stop!'"""
"So, as the way was long, the Lad turned in this night too to the landlord; but as he could pretty well guess how things stood as to the cloth and the ram, he lay down at once on the bench and began to snore, as if he were asleep."
"Now the landlord, who easily saw that the stick must be worth something, hunted up one which was like it, and when he heard the lad snore, was going to change the two; but, just as the landlord was about to take it, the Lad bawled out:"
"""Stick, stick! lay on!"""
"So the stick began to beat the landlord, till he jumped over chairs, and tables, and benches, and yelled and roared:"
"""Oh my! oh my! bid the stick be still, else it will beat me to death, and you shall have back both your cloth and your ram."""
"When the Lad thought the landlord had got enough, he said:"
"""Stick, stick! now stop!"""
"Then he took the cloth and put it into his pocket, and went home with his stick in his hand, leading the ram by a cord round its horns; and so he got his rights for the meal he had lost."
THE THREE PRINCESSES OF WHITELAND
"Once on a time there was a fisherman who lived close by a palace, and fished for the King's table. One day when he was out fishing he just caught nothing. Do what he would however he tried with bait and angle there was never a sprat on his hook. But when the day was far spent a head bobbed up out of the water, and said:"
"""If I may have what your wife bears under her girdle, you shall catch fish enough."""
"So the man answered boldly, ""Yes;"" for he did not know that his wife was going to have a child. After that, as was like enough, he caught plenty of fish of all kinds. But when he got home at night and told his story, how he had got all that fish, his wife fell a-weeping and moaning, and was beside herself for the promise which her husband had made, for she said, ""I bear a babe under my girdle."""
How did they get home again? By the Snowdon railway of course.
"And was the nation grateful? Well the nation was very wet. And by the time the nation had gotten dry again it was interested in the new invention for toasting muffins by electricity, and all the dragons were almost forgotten. Dragons do not seem so important when they are dead and gone, and, you know, there never was a reward offered."
And what did Father and Mother say when Effie and Harry got home?
"My dear, that is the sort of silly question you children always will ask. However, just for this once I don't mind telling you."
"Mother said: ""Oh, my darlings, my darlings, you're safe you're safe!"
"You naughty children how could you be so disobedient? Go to bed at once!"""
"And their father the doctor said: ""I wish I had known what you were going to do! I should have liked to preserve a specimen. I threw away the one I got out of Effie's eye. I intended to get a more perfect specimen. I did not anticipate this immediate extinction of the species."""
"The professor said nothing, but he rubbed his hands. He had kept his specimen the one the size of an earwig that he gave Harry half a crown for and he has it to this day."
You must get him to show it to you!
"IV. The Ice Dragon, or Do as You Are Told"
"This is the tale of the wonders that befell on the evening of the eleventh of December, when they did what they were told not to do. You may think that you know all the unpleasant things that could possibly happen to you if you are disobedient, but there are some things which even you do not know, and they did not know them either."
Their names were George and Jane.
"There were no fireworks that year on Guy Fawkes' Day, because the heir to the throne was not well. He was cutting his first tooth, and that is a very anxious time for any person even for a Royal one. He was really very poorly, so that fireworks would have been in the worst possible taste, even at Land's End or in the Isle of Man, whilst in Forest Hill, which was the home of Jane and George, anything of the kind was quite out of the question. Even the Crystal Palace, empty-headed as it is, felt that this was no time for Catherine-wheels."
"But when the Prince had cut his tooth, rejoicings were not only admissible but correct, and the eleventh of December was proclaimed firework day. All the people were most anxious to show their loyalty, and to enjoy themselves at the same time. So there were fireworks and torchlight processions, and set pieces at the Crystal Palace, with ""Blessings on our Prince"" and ""Long Live our Royal Darling"" in different-colored fires; and the most private of boarding schools had a half holiday; and even the children of plumbers and authors had tuppence each given them to spend as they liked."
"George and Jane had sixpence each and they spent the whole amount on a golden rain, which would not light for ever so long, and when it did light went out almost at once, so they had to look at the fireworks in the gardens next door, and at the ones at the Crystal Palace, which were very glorious indeed."
"All their relations had colds in their heads, so Jane and George were allowed to go out into the garden alone to let off their firework. Jane had put on her fur cape and her thick gloves, and her hood with the silver fox fur on it that was made out of Mother's old muff; and George had his overcoat with the three capes, and his comforter, and Father's sealskin traveling cap with the pieces that come down over your ears."
"It was dark in the garden, but the fireworks all about made it seem very gay, and though the children were cold they were quite sure that they were enjoying themselves."
"They got up on the fence at the end of the garden to see better; and then they saw, very far away, where the edge of the dark world is, a shining line of straight, beautiful lights arranged in a row, as if they were the spears carried by a fairy army."
"""Oh, how pretty,"" said Jane. ""I wonder what they are. It looks as if the fairies were planting little shining baby poplar trees and watering them with liquid light."""
"""Liquid fiddlestick!"" said George. He had been to school, so he knew that these were only the Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights. And he said so."
"""But what is the Rory Bory what's-its-name?"" asked Jane. ""Who lights it, and what's it there for?"""
George had to own that he had not learned that.
"""But I know,"" said he, ""that it has something to do with the Great Bear, and the Dipper, and the Plough, and Charles's Wain."""
"""And what are they?"" asked Jane."
"""Oh, they're the surnames of some of the star families. There goes a jolly rocket,"" answered George, and Jane felt as if she almost understood about the star families."
"The fairy spears of light twinkled and gleamed: They were much prettier than the big, blaring, blazing bonfire that was smoking and flaming and spluttering in the next-door-but-one garden prettier even than the colored fires at the Crystal Palace."
"""I wish we could see them nearer,"" Jane said. ""I wonder if the star families are nice families the kind that Mother would like us to go to tea with, if we were little stars?"""
"""They aren't that sort of families at all, Silly,"" said her brother, kindly trying to explain. ""I only said 'families' because a kid like you wouldn't have understood if I'd said constel ... and, besides, I've forgotten the end of the word. Anyway, the stars are all up in the sky, so you can't go to tea with them."""
"""No,"" said Jane. ""I said if we were little stars."""
"""But we aren't,"" said George."
"""No,"" said Jane, with a sigh. ""I know that. I'm not so stupid as you think, George. But the Tory Bories are somewhere at the edge. Couldn't we go and see them?"""
"“I must go out unto my maid, Who keeps my thoughts for me,”"
"And ran out and found Maid Maleen, “Girl, what didst thou say to the foot-bridge?”"
"“I said nothing but,"
"“Foot-bridge, do not break, I am not the true bride.”"
"“That costs thee thy life!” cried the bride, but she hurried into the room, and said, “I know now what I said to the foot-bridge,” and she repeated the words. “But what didst thou say to the church-door?” “To the church-door?” she replied; “I don’t talk to church-doors.” “Then thou art not the true bride.”"
"She went out and found Maid Maleen, and said, “Girl, what didst thou say to the church-door?”"
"“I said nothing but,"
"“Church-door, break not, I am not the true bride.”"
"“That will break thy neck for thee!” cried the bride, and flew into a terrible passion, but she hastened back into the room, and said, “I know now what I said to the church-door,” and she repeated the words."
“But where hast thou the jewel which I gave thee at the church-door?”
"“What jewel?” she answered; “thou didst not give me any jewel.” “I myself put it round thy neck, and I myself fastened it; if thou dost not know that, thou art not the true bride.” He drew the veil from her face, and when he saw her immeasurable ugliness, he sprang back terrified, and said, “How comest thou here? Who art thou?” “I am thy betrothed bride, but because I feared lest the people should mock me when they saw me out of doors, I commanded the scullery-maid to dress herself in my clothes, and to go to church instead of me.” “Where is the girl?” said he; “I want to see her, go and bring her here.” She went out and told the servants that the scullery-maid was an impostor, and that they must take her out into the court-yard and strike off her head. The servants laid hold of Maid Maleen and wanted to drag her out, but she screamed so loudly for help, that the King’s son heard her voice, hurried out of his chamber and ordered them to set the maiden free instantly. Lights were brought, and then he saw on her neck the gold chain which he had given her at the church-door. “Thou art the true bride,” said he, “who went with me to the church; come with me now to my room.” When they were both alone, he said, “On the way to church thou didst name Maid Maleen, who was my betrothed bride; if I could believe it possible, I should think she was standing before me thou art like her in every respect.” She answered, “I am Maid Maleen, who for thy sake was imprisoned seven years in the darkness, who suffered hunger and thirst, and has lived so long in want and poverty. To-day, however, the sun is shining on me once more. I was married to thee in the church, and I am thy lawful wife.” Then they kissed each other, and were happy all the days of their lives. The false bride was rewarded for what she had done by having her head cut off."
"The tower in which Maid Maleen had been imprisoned remained standing for a long time, and when the children passed by it they sang,"
"“Kling, klang, gloria."
Who sits within this tower?
"A King’s daughter, she sits within, A sight of her I cannot win, The wall it will not break, The stone cannot be pierced."
"Little Hans, with your coat so gay, Follow me, follow me, fast as you may.”"
The Lion and the Crane
The Bodhisatta was at one time born in the region of Himavanta as a white crane; now Brahmadatta was at that time reigning in Benares. Now it chanced that as a lion was eating meat a bone stuck in his throat.
"The throat became swollen, he could not take food, his suffering was terrible. The crane seeing him, as he was perched on a tree looking for food, asked, ""What ails thee, friend?"" He told him why. ""I could free thee from that bone, friend, but dare not enter thy mouth for fear thou mightest eat me."" ""Don't be afraid, friend, I'll not eat thee; only save my life."" ""Very well,"" says he, and caused him to lie down on his left side. But thinking to himself, ""Who knows what this fellow will do,"" he placed a small stick upright between his two jaws that he could not close his mouth, and inserting his head inside his mouth struck one end of the bone with his beak. Whereupon the bone dropped and fell out. As soon as he had caused the bone to fall, he got out of the lion's mouth, striking the stick with his beak so that it fell out, and then settled on a branch. The lion gets well, and one day was eating a buffalo he had killed. The crane thinking ""I will sound him,"" settled on a branch just over him, and in conversation spoke this first verse:"
"""A service have we done thee       To the best of our ability,     King of the Beasts! Your Majesty!"
"What return shall we get from thee?"""
In reply the Lion spoke the second verse:
"""As I feed on blood,       And always hunt for prey,     'Tis much that thou art still alive       Having once been between my teeth."""
Then in reply the crane said the two other verses:
"""Ungrateful, doing no good,       Not doing as he would be done by,     In him there is no gratitude,       To serve him is useless."
"""His friendship is not won       By the clearest good deed."
"Better softly withdraw from him,       Neither envying nor abusing."""
And having thus spoken the crane flew away.
"And when the great Teacher, Gautama the Buddha, told this tale, he used to add: ""Now at that time the lion was Devadatta the Traitor, but the white crane was I myself."""
"Then Princess Mary Ann spoke up royally, and said, ""Don't be silly, because it's only in fairy stories and histories of England and things like that, that people are unkind and want to hurt each other. In Rotundia everyone is kind, and no one has anything to be afraid of, unless they're naughty; and then we know it's for our own good. Let's all go and see the dragon. We might take him some acid drops."" So they went. And all the titled children took it in turns to feed the dragon with acid drops, and he seemed pleased and flattered, and wagged as much of his purple tail as he could get at conveniently; for it was a very, very long tail indeed. But when it came to the Princess's turn to give an acid drop to the dragon, he smiled a very wide smile, and wagged his tail to the very last long inch of it, as much as to say, ""Oh, you nice, kind, pretty little Princess."" But deep down in his wicked purple heart he was saying, ""Oh, you nice, fat, pretty little Princess, I should like to eat you instead of these silly acid drops."" But of course nobody heard him except the Princess's uncle, and he was a magician, and accustomed to listening at doors. It was part of his trade."
"Now, you will remember that I told you there was one wicked person in Rotundia, and I cannot conceal from you any longer that this Complete Bad was the Princess's Uncle James. Magicians are always bad, as you know from your fairy books, and some uncles are bad, as you see by the Babes in the Wood, or the Norfolk Tragedy, and one James at least was bad, as you have learned from your English history. And when anyone is a magician, and is also an uncle, and is named James as well, you need not expect anything nice from him. He is a Threefold Complete Bad and he will come to no good."
"Uncle James had long wanted to get rid of the Princess and have the kingdom to himself. He did not like many things a nice kingdom was almost the only thing he cared for but he had never seen his way quite clearly, because everyone is so kind in Rotundia that wicked spells will not work there, but run off those blameless islanders like water off a duck's back. Now, however, Uncle James thought there might be a chance for him because he knew that now there were two wicked people on the island who could stand by each other himself and the dragon. He said nothing, but he exchanged a meaningful glance with the dragon, and everyone went home to tea. And no one had seen the meaningful glance except Tom."
"Tom went home, and told his elephant all about it. The intelligent little creature listened carefully, and then climbed from Tom's knee to the table, on which stood an ornamental calendar that the Princess had given Tom for a Christmas present. With its tiny trunk the elephant pointed out a date the fifteenth of August, the Princess's birthday, and looked anxiously at its master."
"""What is it, Fido good little elephant then?"" said Tom, and the sagacious animal repeated its former gesture. Then Tom understood."
"""Oh, something is to happen on her birthday? All right. I'll be on the lookout."" And he was."
"At first the people of Rotundia were quite pleased with the dragon, who lived by the pillar and fed himself from the bun trees, but by-and-by he began to wander. He would creep into the burrows made by the great rabbits; and excursionists, sporting on the downs, would see his long, tight, whiplike tail wriggling down a burrow and out of sight, and before they had time to say, ""There he goes,"" his ugly purple head would come poking out from another rabbit-hole perhaps just behind them or laugh softly to itself just in their ears. And the dragon's laugh was not a merry one. This sort of hide-and-seek amused people at first, but by-and-by it began to get on their nerves: and if you don't know what that means, ask Mother to tell you next time you are playing blind man's buff when she has a headache. Then the dragon got into the habit of cracking his tail, as people crack whips, and this also got on people's nerves. Then, too, little things began to be missed. And you know how unpleasant that is, even in a private school, and in a public kingdom it is, of course, much worse. The things that were missed were nothing much at first a few little elephants, a hippopotamus or two, and some giraffes, and things like that. It was nothing much, as I say, but it made people feel uncomfortable. Then one day a favorite rabbit of the Princess's, called Frederick, mysteriously disappeared, and then came a terrible morning when the Mexican lapdog was missing. He had barked ever since the dragon came to the island, and people had grown quite used to the noise. So when his barking suddenly ceased it woke everybody up and they all went out to see what was the matter. And the lapdog was gone!"
"A boy was sent to wake the army, so that it might look for him. But the army was gone too! And now the people began to be frightened. Then Uncle James came out onto the terrace of the palace, and he made the people a speech. He said: ""Friends fellow citizens I cannot disguise from myself or from you that this purple dragon is a poor penniless exile, a helpless alien in our midst, and, besides, he is a is no end of a dragon."""
"The people thought of the dragon's tail and said, ""Hear, hear."""
"Uncle James went on: ""Something has happened to a gentle and defenseless member of our community. We don't know what has happened."""
"Everyone thought of the rabbit named Frederick, and groaned."
"""The defenses of our country have been swallowed up,"" said Uncle James."
Everyone thought of the poor army.
"""There is only one thing to be done."" Uncle James was warming to his subject. ""Could we ever forgive ourselves if by neglecting a simple precaution we lost more rabbits or even, perhaps, our navy, our police, and our fire brigade? For I warn you that the purple dragon will respect nothing, however sacred."""
"Everyone thought of themselves and they said, ""What is the simple precaution?"""
"Then Uncle James said: ""Tomorrow is the dragon's birthday. He is accustomed to have a present on his birthday. If he gets a nice present he will be in a hurry to take it away and show it to his friends, and he will fly off and never come back."""
The crowd cheered wildly and the Princess from her balcony clapped her hands.
"""The present the dragon expects,"" said Uncle James, cheerfully, ""is rather an expensive one. But, when we give, it should not be in a grudging spirit, especially to visitors. What the dragon wants is a Princess. We have only one Princess, it is true; but far be it from us to display a miserly temper at such a moment. And the gift is worthless that costs the giver nothing. Your readiness to give up your Princess will only show how generous you are."""
"The crowd began to cry, for they loved their Princess, though they quite saw that their first duty was to be generous and give the poor dragon what it wanted."
"The Princess began to cry, for she did not want to be anybody's birthday present especially a purple dragon's. And Tom began to cry because he was so angry."
He went straight home and told his little elephant; and the elephant cheered him up so much that presently the two grew quite absorbed in a top that the elephant was spinning with his little trunk.
Early in the morning Tom went to the palace. He looked out across the downs there were hardly any rabbits playing there now and then he gathered white roses and threw them at the Princess's window till she woke up and looked out.
"""Come up and kiss me,"" she said."
"So Tom climbed up the white rosebush and kissed the Princess through the window, and said: ""Many happy returns of the day."""
"Then Mary Ann began to cry, and said: ""Oh, Tom how can you? When you know quite well """
"""Oh, don't,"" said Tom. ""Why, Mary Ann, my precious, my Princess what do you think I should be doing while the dragon was getting his birthday present? Don't cry, my own little Mary Ann! Fido and I have arranged everything. You've only got to do as you are told."""
"""Is that all?"" said the Princess. ""Oh that's easy I've often done that!"""
"Then Tom told her what she was to do. And she kissed him again and again. ""Oh, you dear, good, clever Tom,"" she said. ""How glad I am that I gave you Fido. You two have saved me. You dears!"""
"The next morning Uncle James put on his best coat and hat and the vest with the gold snakes on it he was a magician, and he had a bright taste in vests and he called with a cab to take the Princess out."
"""Come, little birthday present,"" he said tenderly. ""The dragon will be so pleased. And I'm glad to see you're not crying. You know, my child, we cannot begin too young to learn to think of the happiness of others rather than our own. I should not like my dear little niece to be selfish, or to wish to deny a trivial pleasure to a poor, sick dragon, far from his home and friends."""
The Princess said she would try not to be selfish.
"In the white lily bloom, Brave boy, is thy tomb.”"
"When the two heard that, they were frightened to death, and ran away in great haste. When the King came home they told him that the Queen had been delivered of a dog. Then the King said, “What God does, is well done!” But a fisherman who dwelt near the water fished the little boy out again while he was still alive, and as his wife had no children, they reared him. When a year had gone by, the King again went away, and the Queen had another little boy, whom the false sisters likewise took and threw into the water. Then up flew a little bird again and sang,"
"“To thy death art thou sped, Until God’s word be said."
"In the white lily bloom, Brave boy, is thy tomb.”"
"And when the King came back, they told him that the Queen had once more given birth to a dog, and he again said, “What God does, is well done.”"
"The fisherman, however, fished this one also out of the water, and reared him."
"Then the King again journeyed forth, and the Queen had a little girl, whom also the false sisters threw into the water. Then again a little bird flew up on high and sang,"
“To thy death art thou sped Until God’s word be said.
"In the white lily bloom, Bonny girl, is thy tomb.”"
"And when the King came home they told him that the Queen had been delivered of a cat. Then the King grew angry, and ordered his wife to be cast into prison, and therein was she shut up for many long years."
"In the meantime the children had grown up. Then eldest once went out with some other boys to fish, but the other boys would not have him with them, and said, “Go thy way, foundling.”"
"Hereupon he was much troubled, and asked the old fisherman if that was true? The fisherman told him that once when he was fishing he had drawn him out of the water. So the boy said he would go forth and seek his father. The fisherman, however, entreated him to stay, but he would not let himself be hindered, and at last the fisherman consented. Then the boy went on his way and walked for many days, and at last he came to a great piece of water by the side of which stood an old woman fishing."
"“Good day, mother,” said the boy."
"“Many thanks,” said she."
“Thou wilt fish long enough before thou catchest anything.”
“And thou wilt seek long enough before thou findest thy father. How wilt thou get over the water?” said the woman.
“God knows.”
"Then the old woman took him up on her back and carried him through it, and he sought for a long time, but could not find his father."
"When a year had gone by, the second boy set out to seek his brother. He came to the water, and all fared with him just as with his brother. And now there was no one at home but the daughter, and she mourned for her brothers so much that at last she also begged the fisherman to let her set forth, for she wished to go in search of her brothers. Then she likewise came to the great piece of water, and she said to the old woman, “Good day, mother.”"
"“Many thanks,” replied the old woman."
"“May God help you with your fishing,” said the maiden. When the old woman heard that, she became quite friendly, and carried her over the water, gave her a wand, and said to her, “Go, my daughter, ever onwards by this road, and when you come to a great black dog, you must pass it silently and boldly, without either laughing or looking at it. Then you will come to a great high castle, on the threshold of which you must let the wand fall, and go straight through the castle, and out again on the other side. There you will see an old fountain out of which a large tree has grown, whereon hangs a bird in a cage which you must take down. Take likewise a glass of water out of the fountain, and with these two things go back by the same way. Pick up the wand again from the threshold and take it with you, and when you again pass by the dog, strike him in the face with it, but be sure that you hit him, and then just come back here to me.” The maiden found everything exactly as the old woman had said, and on her way back she found her two brothers who had sought each other over half the world. They went together to the place where the black dog was lying on the road; she struck it in the face, and it turned into a handsome prince who went with them to the river. There the old woman was still standing. She rejoiced much to see them again, and carried them all over the water, and then she too went away, for now she was freed. The others, however, went to the old fisherman, and all were glad that they had found each other again, but they hung the bird on the wall."
"But the second son could not settle at home, and took his cross-bow and went a-hunting. When he was tired he took his flute, and made music."
"The King was hunting too, and heard that and went thither, and when he met the youth, he said, “Who has given thee leave to hunt here?”"
"“Oh, no one.”"
"“To whom dost thou belong, then?”"
“I am the fisherman’s son.”
“But he has no children.”
"“If thou wilt not believe, come with me.”"
"That the King did, and questioned the fisherman, who told everything to him, and the little bird on the wall began to sing,"
"“The mother sits alone There in the prison small, O King of royal blood, These are thy children all."
"The sisters twain so false, They wrought the children woe, There in the waters deep Where the fishermen come and go.”"
"Then they were all terrified, and the King took the bird, the fisherman and the three children back with him to the castle, and ordered the prison to be opened and brought his wife out again. She had, however, grown quite ill and weak. Then the daughter gave her some of the water of the fountain to drink, and she became strong and healthy. But the two false sisters were burnt, and the daughter married the prince."
"""Behold him then, O excellent by strength!"
"And speak wise words, not out of season."
"You see how, by his talking overmuch,     The tortoise fell into this wretched plight!"""
"The king saw that he was himself referred to, and said, ""O Teacher!"
"are you speaking of us?"""
"And the Bodisat spake openly, and said, ""O great king! be it thou, or be it any other, whoever talks beyond measure meets with some mishap like this."""
"And the king henceforth refrained himself, and became a man of few words."
A Lac of Rupees for a Bit of Advice
"A poor blind Brahman and his wife were dependent on their son for their subsistence. Every day the young fellow used to go out and get what he could by begging. This continued for some time, till at last he became quite tired of such a wretched life, and determined to go and try his luck in another country. He informed his wife of his intention, and ordered her to manage somehow or other for the old people during the few months that he would be absent. He begged her to be industrious, lest his parents should be angry and curse him."
"One morning he started with some food in a bundle, and walked on day after day, till he reached the chief city of the neighbouring country."
"Here he went and sat down by a merchant's shop and asked alms. The merchant inquired whence he had come, why he had come, and what was his caste; to which he replied that he was a Brahman, and was wandering hither and thither begging a livelihood for himself and wife and parents. Moved with pity for the man, the merchant advised him to visit the kind and generous king of that country, and offered to accompany him to the court. Now at that time it happened that the king was seeking for a Brahman to look after a golden temple which he had just had built. His Majesty was very glad, therefore, when he saw the Brahman and heard that he was good and honest. He at once deputed him to the charge of this temple, and ordered fifty kharwars of rice and one hundred rupees to be paid to him every year as wages."
"Two months after this, the Brahman's wife, not having heard any news of her husband, left the house and went in quest of him. By a happy fate she arrived at the very place that he had reached, where she heard that every morning at the golden temple a golden rupee was given in the king's name to any beggar who chose to go for it. Accordingly, on the following morning she went to the place and met her husband."
"""Why have you come here?"" he asked. ""Why have you left my parents?"
"Care you not whether they curse me and I die? Go back immediately, and await my return."""
"""No, no,"" said the woman. ""I cannot go back to starve and see your old father and mother die. There is not a grain of rice left in the house."""
"""O Bhagawant!"" exclaimed the Brahman. ""Here, take this,"" he continued, scribbling a few lines on some paper, and then handing it to her, ""and give it to the king. You will see that he will give you a lac of rupees for it."" Thus saying he dismissed her, and the woman left."
"On this scrap of paper were written three pieces of advice First, If a person is travelling and reaches any strange place at night, let him be careful where he puts up, and not close his eyes in sleep, lest he close them in death. Secondly, If a man has a married sister, and visits her in great pomp, she will receive him for the sake of what she can obtain from him; but if he comes to her in poverty, she will frown on him and disown him. Thirdly, If a man has to do any work, he must do it himself, and do it with might and without fear."
"On reaching her home the Brahmani told her parents of her meeting with her husband, and what a valuable piece of paper he had given her; but not liking to go before the king herself, she sent one of her relations. The king read the paper, and ordering the man to be flogged, dismissed him. The next morning the Brahmani took the paper, and while she was going along the road to the darbar reading it, the king's son met her, and asked what she was reading, whereupon she replied that she held in her hands a paper containing certain bits of advice, for which she wanted a lac of rupees. The prince asked her to show it to him, and when he had read it gave her a parwana for the amount, and rode on. The poor Brahmani was very thankful. That day she laid in a great store of provisions, sufficient to last them all for a long time."
"In the evening the prince related to his father the meeting with the woman, and the purchase of the piece of paper. He thought his father would applaud the act. But it was not so. The king was more angry than before, and banished his son from the country."
"So the prince bade adieu to his mother and relations and friends, and rode off on his horse, whither he did not know. At nightfall he arrived at some place, where a man met him, and invited him to lodge at his house. The prince accepted the invitation, and was treated like a prince. Matting was spread for him to squat on, and the best provisions set before him."
"""Ah!"" thought he, as he lay down to rest, ""here is a case for the first piece of advice that the Brahmani gave me. I will not sleep to-night."""
"It was well that he thus resolved, for in the middle of the night the man rose up, and taking a sword in his hand, rushed to the prince with the intention of killing him. But he rose up and spoke."
"""Do not slay me,"" he said. ""What profit would you get from my death?"
"If you killed me you would be sorry afterwards, like that man who killed his dog."""
"""What man? What dog?"" he asked."
"""I will tell you,"" said the prince, ""if you will give me that sword."""
"So he gave him the sword, and the prince began his story:"
"""Once upon a time there lived a wealthy merchant who had a pet dog. He was suddenly reduced to poverty, and had to part with his dog. He got a loan of five thousand rupees from a brother merchant, leaving the dog as a pledge, and with the money began business again. Not long after this the other merchant's shop was broken into by thieves and completely sacked. There was hardly ten rupees' worth left in the place. The faithful dog, however, knew what was going on, and went and followed the thieves, and saw where they deposited the things, and then returned."
"""In the morning there was great weeping and lamentation in the merchant's house when it was known what had happened. The merchant himself nearly went mad. Meanwhile the dog kept on running to the door, and pulling at his master's shirt and paijamas, as though wishing him to go outside. At last a friend suggested that, perhaps, the dog knew something of the whereabouts of the things, and advised the merchant to follow its leadings. The merchant consented, and went after the dog right up to the very place where the thieves had hidden the goods. Here the animal scraped and barked, and showed in various ways that the things were underneath. So the merchant and his friends dug about the place, and soon came upon all the stolen property."
Nothing was missing. There was everything just as the thieves had taken them.
"""The merchant was very glad. On returning to his house, he at once sent the dog back to its old master with a letter rolled under the collar, wherein he had written about the sagacity of the beast, and begged his friend to forget the loan and to accept another five thousand rupees as a present. When this merchant saw his dog coming back again, he thought, 'Alas! my friend is wanting the money. How can I pay him? I have not had sufficient time to recover myself from my recent losses. I will slay the dog ere he reaches the threshold, and say that another must have slain it. Thus there will be an end of my debt. No dog, no loan.' Accordingly he ran out and killed the poor dog, when the letter fell out of its collar. The merchant picked it up and read it. How great was his grief and disappointment when he knew the facts of the case!"
"But the minister, named Devajnanin, whispered in the king's ear: ""How can a man possess such knowledge unattainable by men, without having studied the books of magic; you may be certain that this is a specimen of the way he makes a dishonest livelihood, by having a secret intelligence with thieves. It will be much better to test him by some new artifice."" Then the king of his own accord brought a covered pitcher into which he had thrown a frog, and said to Harisarman, ""Brahman, if you can guess what there is in this pitcher, I will do you great honour to-day."" When the Brahman Harisarman heard that, he thought that his last hour had come, and he called to mind the pet name of ""Froggie"" which his father had given him in his childhood in sport, and, impelled by luck, he called to himself by his pet name, lamenting his hard fate, and suddenly called out: ""This is a fine pitcher for you, Froggie; it will soon become the swift destroyer of your helpless self."" The people there, when they heard him say that, raised a shout of applause, because his speech chimed in so well with the object presented to him, and murmured, ""Ah! a great sage, he knows even about the frog!"" Then the king, thinking that this was all due to knowledge of divination, was highly delighted, and gave Harisarman the revenue of more villages, with gold, an umbrella, and state carriages of all kinds. So Harisarman prospered in the world."
The Charmed Ring
"A merchant started his son in life with three hundred rupees, and bade him go to another country and try his luck in trade. The son took the money and departed. He had not gone far before he came across some herdsmen quarrelling over a dog, that some of them wished to kill."
"""Please do not kill the dog,"" pleaded the young and tender-hearted fellow; ""I will give you one hundred rupees for it."" Then and there, of course, the bargain was concluded, and the foolish fellow took the dog, and continued his journey. He next met with some people fighting about a cat. Some of them wanted to kill it, but others not. ""Oh!"
"please do not kill it,"" said he; ""I will give you one hundred rupees for it."" Of course they at once gave him the cat and took the money."
"He went on till he reached a village, where some folk were quarrelling over a snake that had just been caught. Some of them wished to kill it, but others did not. ""Please do not kill the snake,"" said he; ""I will give you one hundred rupees."" Of course the people agreed, and were highly delighted."
What a fool the fellow was! What would he do now that all his money was gone? What could he do except return to his father? Accordingly he went home.
"""You fool! You scamp!"" exclaimed his father when he had heard how his son had wasted all the money that had been given to him. ""Go and live in the stables and repent of your folly. You shall never again enter my house."""
"So the young man went and lived in the stables. His bed was the grass spread for the cattle, and his companions were the dog, the cat, and the snake, which he had purchased so dearly. These creatures got very fond of him, and would follow him about during the day, and sleep by him at night; the cat used to sleep at his feet, the dog at his head, and the snake over his body, with its head hanging on one side and its tail on the other."
"One day the snake in course of conversation said to its master, ""I am the son of Raja Indrasha. One day, when I had come out of the ground to drink the air, some people seized me, and would have slain me had you not most opportunely arrived to my rescue. I do not know how I shall ever be able to repay you for your great kindness to me. Would that you knew my father! How glad he would be to see his son's preserver!"""
"""Where does he live? I should like to see him, if possible,"" said the young man."
"""Well said!"" continued the snake. ""Do you see yonder mountain? At the bottom of that mountain there is a sacred spring. If you will come with me and dive into that spring, we shall both reach my father's country. Oh! how glad he will be to see you! He will wish to reward you, too. But how can he do that? However, you may be pleased to accept something at his hand. If he asks you what you would like, you would, perhaps, do well to reply, 'The ring on your right hand, and the famous pot and spoon which you possess.' With these in your possession, you would never need anything, for the ring is such that a man has only to speak to it, and immediately a beautiful furnished mansion will be provided for him, while the pot and the spoon will supply him with all manner of the rarest and most delicious foods."""
"Attended by his three companions the man walked to the well and prepared to jump in, according to the snake's directions. ""O master!"""
"exclaimed the cat and dog, when they saw what he was going to do."
"""What shall we do? Where shall we go?"""
"""Wait for me here,"" he replied. ""I am not going far. I shall not be long away."" On saying this, he dived into the water and was lost to sight."
"""Now what shall we do?"" said the dog to the cat."
"""We must remain here,"" replied the cat, ""as our master ordered. Do not be anxious about food. I will go to the people's houses and get plenty of food for both of us."" And so the cat did, and they both lived very comfortably till their master came again and joined them."
"The young man and the snake reached their destination in safety; and information of their arrival was sent to the Raja. His highness commanded his son and the stranger to appear before him. But the snake refused, saying that it could not go to its father till it was released from this stranger, who had saved it from a most terrible death, and whose slave it therefore was. Then the Raja went and embraced his son, and saluting the stranger welcomed him to his dominions. The young man stayed there a few days, during which he received the Raja's right-hand ring, and the pot and spoon, in recognition of His Highness's gratitude to him for having delivered his son. He then returned. On reaching the top of the spring he found his friends, the dog and the cat, waiting for him. They told one another all they had experienced since they had last seen each other, and were all very glad. Afterwards they walked together to the river side, where it was decided to try the powers of the charmed ring and pot and spoon."
"The merchant's son spoke to the ring, and immediately a beautiful house and a lovely princess with golden hair appeared. He spoke to the pot and spoon, also, and the most delicious dishes of food were provided for them. So he married the princess, and they lived very happily for several years, until one morning the princess, while arranging her toilet, put the loose hairs into a hollow bit of reed and threw them into the river that flowed along under the window. The reed floated on the water for many miles, and was at last picked up by the prince of that country, who curiously opened it and saw the golden hair. On finding it the prince rushed off to the palace, locked himself up in his room, and would not leave it. He had fallen desperately in love with the woman whose hair he had picked up, and refused to eat, or drink, or sleep, or move, till she was brought to him. The king, his father, was in great distress about the matter, and did not know what to do. He feared lest his son should die and leave him without an heir. At last he determined to seek the counsel of his aunt, who was an ogress. The old woman consented to help him, and bade him not to be anxious, as she felt certain that she would succeed in getting the beautiful woman for his son's wife."
"She assumed the shape of a bee and went along buzzing, and buzzing, and buzzing. Her keen sense of smell soon brought her to the beautiful princess, to whom she appeared as an old hag, holding in one hand a stick by way of support. She introduced herself to the beautiful princess and said, ""I am your aunt, whom you have never seen before, because I left the country just after your birth."" She also embraced and kissed the princess by way of adding force to her words. The beautiful princess was thoroughly deceived. She returned the ogress's embrace, and invited her to come and stay in the house as long as she could, and treated her with such honour and attention, that the ogress thought to herself, ""I shall soon accomplish my errand."" When she had been in the house three days, she began to talk of the charmed ring, and advised her to keep it instead of her husband, because the latter was constantly out shooting and on other such-like expeditions, and might lose it. Accordingly the beautiful princess asked her husband for the ring, and he readily gave it to her."
"The ogress waited another day before she asked to see the precious thing. Doubting nothing, the beautiful princess complied, when the ogress seized the ring, and reassuming the form of a bee flew away with it to the palace, where the prince was lying nearly on the point of death. ""Rise up. Be glad. Mourn no more,"" she said to him. ""The woman for whom you yearn will appear at your summons. See, here is the charm, whereby you may bring her before you."" The prince was almost mad with joy when he heard these words, and was so desirous of seeing the beautiful princess, that he immediately spoke to the ring, and the house with its fair occupant descended in the midst of the palace garden. He at once entered the building, and telling the beautiful princess of his intense love, entreated her to be his wife. Seeing no escape from the difficulty, she consented on the condition that he would wait one month for her."
"Meanwhile the merchant's son had returned from hunting and was terribly distressed not to find his house and wife. There was the place only, just as he knew it before he had tried the charmed ring which Raja Indrasha had given him. He sat down and determined to put an end to himself. Presently the cat and dog came up. They had gone away and hidden themselves, when they saw the house and everything disappear. ""O master!"" they said, ""stay your hand. Your trial is great, but it can be remedied. Give us one month, and we will go and try to recover your wife and house."""
"""Go,"" said he, ""and may the great God aid your efforts. Bring back my wife, and I shall live."""
"So the cat and dog started off at a run, and did not stop till they reached the place whither their mistress and the house had been taken."
"""We may have some difficulty here,"" said the cat. ""Look, the king has taken our master's wife and house for himself. You stay here. I will go to the house and try to see her."" So the dog sat down, and the cat climbed up to the window of the room, wherein the beautiful princess was sitting, and entered. The princess recognised the cat, and informed it of all that had happened to her since she had left them."
"""But is there no way of escape from the hands of these people?"" she asked."
"""Yes,"" replied the cat, ""if you can tell me where the charmed ring is."""
"""The ring is in the stomach of the ogress,"" she said."
"""All right,"" said the cat, ""I will recover it. If we once get it, everything is ours."" Then the cat descended the wall of the house, and went and laid down by a rat's hole and pretended she was dead. Now at that time a great wedding chanced to be going on among the rat community of that place, and all the rats of the neighbourhood were assembled in that one particular mine by which the cat had lain down."
"The eldest son of the king of the rats was about to be married. The cat got to know of this, and at once conceived the idea of seizing the bridegroom and making him render the necessary help. Consequently, when the procession poured forth from the hole squealing and jumping in honour of the occasion, it immediately spotted the bridegroom and pounced down on him. ""Oh! let me go, let me go,"" cried the terrified rat. ""Oh! let him go,"" squealed all the company. ""It is his wedding day."""
"""No, no,"" replied the cat. ""Not unless you do something for me."
"Are we, too, to risk our lives?” They took counsel as to what they ought to do to prevent the whole town being destroyed. For a long time everything seemed to be of no use, but at length the burgomaster found an expedient. “My opinion,” said he, “is that we ought, out of the common purse, to pay for this barn, and whatsoever corn, straw, or hay it contains, and thus indemnify the owner, and then burn down the whole building, and the terrible beast with it. Thus no one will have to endanger his life. This is no time for thinking of expense, and niggardliness would be ill applied.” All agreed with him. So they set fire to the barn at all four corners, and with it the owl was miserably burnt. Let any one who will not believe it, go thither and inquire for himself."
175 The Moon
"In days gone by there was a land where the nights were always dark, and the sky spread over it like a black cloth, for there the moon never rose, and no star shone in the obscurity. At the creation of the world, the light at night had been sufficient. Three young fellows once went out of this country on a travelling expedition, and arrived in another kingdom, where, in the evening when the sun had disappeared behind the mountains, a shining globe was placed on an oak-tree, which shed a soft light far and wide. By means of this, everything could very well be seen and distinguished, even though it was not so brilliant as the sun."
"The travellers stopped and asked a countryman who was driving past with his cart, what kind of a light that was. “That is the moon,” answered he; “our mayor bought it for three thalers, and fastened it to the oak-tree. He has to pour oil into it daily, and to keep it clean, so that it may always burn clearly. He receives a thaler a week from us for doing it.”"
"When the countryman had driven away, one of them said, “We could make some use of this lamp, we have an oak-tree at home, which is just as big as this, and we could hang it on that. What a pleasure it would be not to have to feel about at night in the darkness!” “I’ll tell you what we’ll do,” said the second; “we will fetch a cart and horses and carry away the moon. The people here may buy themselves another.” “I’m a good climber,” said the third, “I will bring it down.” The fourth brought a cart and horses, and the third climbed the tree, bored a hole in the moon, passed a rope through it, and let it down. When the shining ball lay in the cart, they covered it over with a cloth, that no one might observe the theft. They conveyed it safely into their own country, and placed it on a high oak. Old and young rejoiced, when the new lamp let its light shine over the whole land, and bed-rooms and sitting-rooms were filled with it. The dwarfs came forth from their caves in the rocks, and the tiny elves in their little red coats danced in rings on the meadows."
"The four took care that the moon was provided with oil, cleaned the wick, and received their weekly thaler, but they became old men, and when one of them grew ill, and saw that he was about to die, he appointed that one quarter of the moon, should, as his property, be laid in the grave with him. When he died, the mayor climbed up the tree, and cut off a quarter with the hedge-shears, and this was placed in his coffin. The light of the moon decreased, but still not visibly."
"When the second died, the second quarter was buried with him, and the light diminished. It grew weaker still after the death of the third, who likewise took his part of it away with him; and when the fourth was borne to his grave, the old state of darkness recommenced, and whenever the people went out at night without their lanterns they knocked their heads together."
"When, however, the pieces of the moon had united themselves together again in the world below, where darkness had always prevailed, it came to pass that the dead became restless and awoke from their sleep. They were astonished when they were able to see again; the moonlight was quite sufficient for them, for their eyes had become so weak that they could not have borne the brilliance of the sun. They rose up and were merry, and fell into their former ways of living. Some of them went to the play and to dance, others hastened to the public-houses, where they asked for wine, got drunk, brawled, quarreled, and at last took up cudgels, and belabored each other. The noise became greater and greater, and at last reached even to heaven."
"Saint Peter who guards the gate of heaven thought the lower world had broken out in revolt and gathered together the heavenly troops, which are to drive back the Evil One when he and his associates storm the abode of the blessed. As these, however, did not come, he got on his horse and rode through the gate of heaven, down into the world below."
"There he reduced the dead to subjection, bade them lie down in their graves again, took the moon away with him, and hung it up in heaven."
176 The Duration of Life
"When God had created the world and was about to fix the length of each creature’s life, the ass came and asked, “Lord, how long shall I live?”"
"“Thirty years,” replied God; “does that content thee?” “Ah, Lord,”"
"answered the ass, “that is a long time. Think of my painful existence!"
"To carry heavy burdens from morning to night, to drag sacks of corn to the mill, that others may eat bread, to be cheered and refreshed with nothing but blows and kicks. Relieve me of a portion of this long time.” Then God had pity on him and relieved him of eighteen years. The ass went away comforted, and the dog appeared. “How long wouldst thou like to live?” said God to him. “Thirty years are too many for the ass, but thou wilt be satisfied with that.” “Lord,” answered the dog, “is that thy will? Consider how I shall have to run, my feet will never hold out so long, and when I have once lost my voice for barking, and my teeth for biting, what will be left for me to do but run from one corner to another and growl?” God saw that he was right, and released him from twelve years of life. Then came the monkey. “Thou wilt certainly live thirty years willingly?” said the Lord to him. “Thou hast no need to work as the ass and the dog have to do, and wilt always enjoy thyself.” “Ah! Lord,” he answered, “it may seem as if that were the case, but it is quite different. When it rains porridge I have no spoon. I am always to play merry pranks, and make faces which force people to laugh, and if they give me an apple, and I bite into it, why it is sour! How often sadness hides itself behind mirth! I shall never be able to hold out for thirty years.” God was gracious and took off ten."
"At last man appeared, joyous, healthy and vigorous, and begged God to appoint his time for him. “Thirty years shalt thou live,” said the Lord. “Is that enough for thee?” “What a short time,” cried man, “when I have built my house and my fire burns on my own hearth; when I have planted trees which blossom and bear fruit, and am just intending to enjoy my life, I am to die! O Lord, lengthen my time.” “I will add to it the ass’s eighteen years,” said God. “That is not enough,” replied the man. “Thou shalt also have the dog’s twelve years.” “Still too little!” “Well, then,” said God, “I will give thee the monkey’s ten years also, but more thou shalt not have.” The man went away, but was not satisfied."
"So man lives seventy years. The first thirty are his human years, which are soon gone; then is he healthy, merry, works with pleasure, and is glad of his life. Then follow the ass’s eighteen years, when one burden after another is laid on him, he has to carry the corn which feeds others, and blows and kicks are the reward of his faithful services."
"Then come the dog’s twelve years, when he lies in the corner, and growls and has no longer any teeth to bite with, and when this time is over the monkey’s ten years form the end. Then man is weak-headed and foolish, does silly things, and becomes the jest of the children."
177 Death’s Messengers
"In ancient times a giant was once travelling on a great highway, when suddenly an unknown man sprang up before him, and said, “Halt, not one step farther!” “What!” cried the giant, “a creature whom I can crush between my fingers, wants to block my way? Who art thou that thou darest to speak so boldly?” “I am Death,” answered the other. “No one resists me, and thou also must obey my commands.” But the giant refused, and began to struggle with Death. It was a long, violent battle, at last the giant got the upper hand, and struck Death down with his fist, so that he dropped by a stone. The giant went his way, and Death lay there conquered, and so weak that he could not get up again. “What will be done now,” said he, “if I stay lying here in a corner? No one will die in the world, and it will get so full of people that they won’t have room to stand beside each other.” In the meantime a young man came along the road, who was strong and healthy, singing a song, and glancing around on every side. When he saw the half-fainting one, he went compassionately to him, raised him up, poured a strengthening draught out of his flask for him, and waited till he came round. “Dost thou know,” said the stranger, whilst he was getting up, “who I am, and who it is whom thou hast helped on his legs again?”"
"“No,” answered the youth, “I do not know thee.” “I am Death,” said he."
"“I spare no one, and can make no exception with thee, but that thou mayst see that I am grateful, I promise thee that I will not fall on thee unexpectedly, but will send my messengers to thee before I come and take thee away.” “Well,” said the youth, “it is something gained that I shall know when thou comest, and at any rate be safe from thee for so long.” Then he went on his way, and was light-hearted, and enjoyed himself, and lived without thought. But youth and health did not last long, soon came sicknesses and sorrows, which tormented him by day, and took away his rest by night. “Die, I shall not,” said he to himself, “for Death will send his messengers before that, but I do wish these wretched days of sickness were over.” As soon as he felt himself well again he began once more to live merrily. Then one day some one tapped him on the shoulder. He looked round, and Death stood behind him, and said, “Follow me, the hour of thy departure from this world has come.” “What,” replied the man, “wilt thou break thy word? Didst thou not promise me that thou wouldst send thy messengers to me before coming thyself? I have seen none!” “Silence!” answered Death. “Have I not sent one messenger to thee after another? Did not fever come and smite thee, and shake thee, and cast thee down? Has dizziness not bewildered thy head? Has not gout twitched thee in all thy limbs? Did not thine ears sing? Did not tooth-ache bite into thy cheeks? Was it not dark before thine eyes? And besides all that, has not my own brother Sleep reminded thee every night of me? Didst thou not lie by night as if thou wert already dead? The man could make no answer; he yielded to his fate, and went away with Death."
178 Master Pfriem (Master Cobbler’s Awl)
"Master Pfriem was a short, thin, but lively man, who never rested a moment. His face, of which his turned-up nose was the only prominent feature, was marked with small-pox and pale as death, his hair was gray and shaggy, his eyes small, but they glanced perpetually about on all sides. He saw everything, criticised everything, knew everything best, and was always in the right. When he went into the streets, he moved his arms about as if he were rowing; and once he struck the pail of a girl, who was carrying water, so high in the air that he himself was wetted all over by it. “Stupid thing,” cried he to her, while he was shaking himself, “couldst thou not see that I was coming behind thee?”"
"By trade he was a shoemaker, and when he worked he pulled his thread out with such force that he drove his fist into every one who did not keep far enough off. No apprentice stayed more than a month with him, for he had always some fault to find with the very best work. At one time it was that the stitches were not even, at another that one shoe was too long, or one heel higher than the other, or the leather not cut large enough. “Wait,” said he to his apprentice, “I will soon show thee how we make skins soft,” and he brought a strap and gave him a couple of strokes across the back. He called them all sluggards. He himself did not turn much work out of his hands, for he never sat still for a quarter of an hour. If his wife got up very early in the morning and lighted the fire, he jumped out of bed, and ran bare-footed into the kitchen, crying, “Wilt thou burn my house down for me? That is a fire one could roast an ox by! Does wood cost nothing?” If the servants were standing by their wash-tubs and laughing, and telling each other all they knew, he scolded them, and said, “There stand the geese cackling, and forgetting their work, to gossip! And why fresh soap? Disgraceful extravagance and shameful idleness into the bargain! They want to save their hands, and not rub the things properly!” And out he would run and knock a pail full of soap and water over, so that the whole kitchen was flooded. Someone was building a new house, so he hurried to the window to look on. “There, they are using that red sand-stone again that never dries!” cried he. “No one will ever be healthy in that house! and just look how badly the fellows are laying the stones! Besides, the mortar is good for nothing! It ought to have gravel in it, not sand. I shall live to see that house tumble down on the people who are in it.” He sat down, put a couple of stitches in, and then jumped up again, unfastened his leather-apron, and cried, “I will just go out, and appeal to those men’s consciences.” He stumbled on the carpenters. “What’s this?” cried he, “you are not working by the line! Do you expect the beams to be straight?—one wrong will put all wrong.” He snatched an axe out of a carpenter’s hand and wanted to show him how he ought to cut; but as a cart loaded with clay came by, he threw the axe away, and hastened to the peasant who was walking by the side of it: “You are not in your right mind,” said he, “who yokes young horses to a heavily-laden cart?"
"The poor beasts will die on the spot.” The peasant did not give him an answer, and Pfriem in a rage ran back into his workshop. When he was setting himself to work again, the apprentice reached him a shoe."
"“Well, what’s that again?” screamed he, “Haven’t I told you you ought not to cut shoes so broad? Who would buy a shoe like this, which is hardly anything else but a sole? I insist on my orders being followed exactly.” “Master,” answered the apprentice, “you may easily be quite right about the shoe being a bad one, but it is the one which you yourself cut out, and yourself set to work at. When you jumped up a while since, you knocked it off the table, and I have only just picked it up. An angel from heaven, however, would never make you believe that.”"
"One night Master Pfriem dreamed he was dead, and on his way to heaven."
"When he got there, he knocked loudly at the door. “I wonder,” said he to himself, “that they have no knocker on the door,—one knocks one’s knuckles sore.” The apostle Peter opened the door, and wanted to see who demanded admission so noisily. “Ah, it’s you, Master Pfriem;” said he, “well, I’ll let you in, but I warn you that you must give up that habit of yours, and find fault with nothing you see in heaven, or you may fare ill.” “You might have spared your warning,” answered Pfriem."
"“I know already what is seemly, and here, God be thanked, everything is perfect, and there is nothing to blame as there is on earth.” So he went in, and walked up and down the wide expanses of heaven. He looked around him, to the left and to the right, but sometimes shook his head, or muttered something to himself. Then he saw two angels who were carrying away a beam. It was the beam which some one had had in his own eye whilst he was looking for the splinter in the eye of another. They did not, however, carry the beam lengthways, but obliquely. “Did any one ever see such a piece of stupidity?” thought Master Pfriem; but he said nothing, and seemed satisfied with it. “It comes to the same thing after all, whichever way they carry the beam, straight or crooked, if they only get along with it, and truly I do not see them knock against anything.” Soon after this he saw two angels who were drawing water out of a well into a bucket, but at the same time he observed that the bucket was full of holes, and that the water was running out of it on every side. They were watering the earth with rain. “Hang it,” he exclaimed; but happily recollected himself, and thought, “Perhaps it is only a pastime. If it is an amusement, then it seems they can do useless things of this kind even here in heaven, where people, as I have already noticed, do nothing but idle about.” He went farther and saw a cart which had stuck fast in a deep hole. “It’s no wonder,” said he to the man who stood by it; “who would load so unreasonably? what have you there?” “Good wishes,” replied the man, “I could not go along the right way with it, but still I have pushed it safely up here, and they won’t leave me sticking here.” In fact an angel did come and harnessed two horses to it. “That’s quite right,” thought Pfriem, “but two horses won’t get that cart out, it must at least have four to it.”"
"Another angel came and brought two more horses; she did not, however, harness them in front of it, but behind. That was too much for Master Pfriem, “Clumsy creature,” he burst out with, “what are you doing there? Has any one ever since the world began seen a cart drawn in that way? But you, in your conceited arrogance, think that you know everything best.” He was going to say more, but one of the inhabitants of heaven seized him by the throat and pushed him forth with irresistible strength. Beneath the gateway Master Pfriem turned his head round to take one more look at the cart, and saw that it was being raised into the air by four winged horses."
"At this moment Master Pfriem awoke. “Things are certainly arranged in heaven otherwise than they are on earth,” said he to himself, “and that excuses much; but who can see horses harnessed both behind and before with patience; to be sure they had wings, but who could know that? It is, besides, great folly to fix a pair of wings to a horse that has four legs to run with already! But I must get up, or else they will make nothing but mistakes for me in my house. It is a lucky thing for me though, that I am not really dead.”"

Curls from the lessening ends that glow;

As you drink your bitters and munch your bread;

The wonder of your face.

"In a few cases, chiefly of artists, a universally-used sobriquet"
"is to be taken in place of the family or forename, as _Tintoretto_"
(whose real name was Giacomo _Robusti_). Similar cases are _Canaletto_
"(Antonio _Canale_ and also B. _Belotto_), _Correggio_ (Ant. _Allegri_),"
"_Garofalo_ (Benvenuto Piero _Tisi_), Il _Sodoma_ (Giov. Ant. _Bazzi_),"
"_Spagnoletto_ (Jusepe _Ribera_, now however oftener called _Ribera_),"
_Uccello_ (Paolo _Doni_). Always cross-reference from the family name.
"(_b_) In particular, ecclesiastical dignitaries: e.g., _Kaye_, John,"
"Bishop of Lincoln. _Lincoln_, John, Bishop of. See _Kaye_."
"Bishops usually omit their family name, canons their forename: e.g.,"
"_Canon Liddon_, _Bishop of Ripon, Henry Edward_, _Archbishop of"
"Westminster_, i.e., _H. E. Manning_. Care must be taken not to treat"
Canon as a forename or Edward as a family name.
"(_c_) Married women, using the known form:"
"Wives often continue writing, and are known in literature only under"
"their maiden names (as _Miss Freer_ or _Fanny Lewald_), or after a"
second marriage retain for literary purposes the first husband's name.
"Enclose the maiden name in parenthesis: e.g., _Ward, Mrs. Elizabeth"
"(Phelps)_. Use the form _White, Mrs. Julia Charlotte, wife of J. C._,"
"when the husband's name is used: e.g., _Hopkins, Mrs Sarah (Drake)"
"Garretson_. _Stowe, Mrs. Emily Howard (Jennings)_. _Soyaux, Frau Frieda"
"(Schanz)_. _Gasparin, Valérie (Boissier) Comtesse de_."
Women known under their husbands' names are to be entered as follows:
"_Hinkson, Mrs. Katherine (Tynan), Mrs. H. A. Hinkson_. Cross-reference"
to be made from the latter form.

there was something about the latter's personality which he could not
reconcile with his previous acquaintance.
At last Francesco's worldly habit flashed upon him.

We’d make our bed in the bracken
With the lark for a chambermaid;
The lark would sing us awake in the mornings
Singing above our head.
We’d drink the sunlight all day long
With never a house to bind us;
And we’d only flout in a merry song
The world we left behind us.
We would be free as birds are free

And we would lie in the sunny bracken
With none to say us nay.

RUIZ.
"One of Captain Gilbert's crew in the pirate schooner _Panda_, which"
plundered the Salem brig _Mexican_ in 1834. Tried in Boston and condemned
"to be hanged. Pleading insanity, he was respited for sixty days and then"
"hanged on September 12th, 1835."
RUPERT. Prince of the Rhine.
"After an adventurous life as a soldier on the Continent, he sailed from"
Ireland in 1648 with seven ships. His own ship was the _Swallow_. He was a
"man of boundless energy, who was never happy if not engaged in some"
"enterprise, and as legitimate warfare gave him few opportunities he turned"
"pirate. He spent five years at sea, largely in the West Indies, meeting"
with every kind of adventure.

"with infinite tenderness in his voice, Johnson asked:"
"""I still should know you,"" answered Frances."
"""Not I!"" exclaimed Bettina."
"Presently Lilly came in, and I presented him to Monsieur l'Abbé du Boise"
and explained the presence of Frances and Bettina by saying:--
"""A friend of ours in France has asked Mistress Jennings to render what"
"aid she can to Monsieur l'Abbé, and she is here at my request to receive"
"his commands."""
"""It is good!"" exclaimed Lilly. ""She has the king's ear if any one has,"
and the ear is very close to the mind. What may I do to serve Monsieur
"l'Abbé?"""
"""If I may see you privately---the baron and me--I shall tell you how you"
"may serve me,"" answered the Abbé."
"The Abbé and I excused ourselves to Frances and Bettina, and went with"
"the Doctor to the room which he called his observatory, where we came to"
the point very quickly:--
"""I want to buy Dunkirk for my master for the sum of one hundred thousand"
"pounds,"" said the Abbé, by way of starting the consultation."
"""But London has already offered that sum,"" returned Lilly, ""and stands"
"ready to pay more."""
"""In payments,"" suggested the Abbé."
"""Yes,"" returned Lilly. ""But I see no way of bringing the king to accept"
"the sum you offer unless--unless Mistress Jennings can persuade him."""
Perhaps--perhaps we may have doubted the man somewhat over-hastily. But
"as for me, I will answer for La Giralda."""
"""For me,"" said El Sarria, sententiously, ""I will answer for no"

CHAPTER XXVII
THE SERGEANT AND LA GIRALDA
The dust-heat of the desolate plains of Old Castile was red on the
horizon when the Sergeant and his companion started together on their
"strange and perilous mission. Would they ever return, and when? What"
"might they not find? A Court deserted and forlorn, courtiers fleeing, or"
"eager to flee if only they knew whither, from the dread and terrible"
"plague? A Queen and a princess without guards, a palace open to the"
plunder of any chance band of robbers? For something like this the imp
of the deserted village had prepared them.
go....
"As Noll, reaching the bottom step, fumbled at the door that led into"
"the tavern of _The Golden Sun_, a young woman in black came languidly"
"down the stairs, and he held the door open for her to pass in."
The light fell on the delicate features of Madelaine. She smiled with
"pleasure, seeing him."
They entered and stood together--a song was being sung--and as the last
"chords were struck, she slipped her hand within his arm; and he left"
it there. She shared the cordial greeting that Noll received from the
faded poets and frequenters of the place. She was very beautiful--but
her face pathetically pale. Noll noticed a dizzy tendency to cling to
"his arm, as though she feared to fall. He found a table, and made her"
sit down beside him.
"“Madelaine,” said he--“you look as if you wanted food.”"
She sighed sadly:
"“Ah, yes--for years,” she said."
He called for a drink and some biscuits for her; and whilst they were
"being brought, he asked her:"
"“What became of you, Madelaine--after the old widow Snacheur was"
killed?”
She sighed sadly:
"for the disturbance, but are themselves badly mauled. Then the Pardoner"
"and the Friar go off amicably together. There is no allegory, no moral;"
merely satire on the fraudulent and hypocritical practices of pardoners
"and friars, together with some horseplay to raise a louder laugh. The"
fashion of that satire may be judged from the following exchange of home
truths by the rival orators.
"_Friar._ What, should ye give ought to parting pardoners?--"
"_Pardoner._ What, should ye spend on these flattering liars,--"
"_Friar._ What, should ye give ought to these bold beggars?--"
"_Pardoner._ As be these babbling monks and these friars,--"
_Friar._ Let them hardly labour for their living;--
_Pardoner._ Which do nought daily but babble and lie--
"_Friar._ It much hurteth them good men's giving,--"
"_Pardoner._ And tell you fables dear enough at a fly,--"
"_Friar._ For that maketh them idle and slothful to wark,--"
_Pardoner._ As doth this babbling friar here to-day?--
_Friar._ That for none other thing they will cark.--
"_Pardoner._ Drive him hence, therefore, in the twenty-devil way!--"

“At the Hotel Excelsior. We are staying there. Will you come?” “All
right.”
"Laura accepted, and they went to the Via Veneto with the Englishman"
riding beside them.
They went into the hotel and passed through to the “hall” full of
"people, Marchmont sent word to his wife by a servant, to come down."
Laura and Cæsar seated themselves with the Englishman.
"“This hotel is unbearable,” exclaimed Marchmont; “there is nothing here"
but Americans.”
"“Your wife, however, must like that,” said Cæsar."
"“No. Susanna is more European every day, and she doesn’t care for the"
"shrieking elegance of her compatriots. Besides, her father is here, and"
that makes her feel less American.”
"“It is an odd form of filial enthusiasm,” remarked Cæsar."
"“It doesn’t shock me. I almost think it’s the rule,” replied Marchmont;"
“at home I could see that my brothers and sisters hated one another
"cordially, and that every member of the family wanted to get away from"
the others. You two who are so fond of each other are a very rare
instance. Is it frequent in Spain that brothers and sisters like one
another?”
"“Yes, there are instances of it,” answered Cæsar, laughing."
"Mrs. Marchmont arrived, accompanied by an old man who evidently was her"
"He set his who?-where? robot for ""Rocket Physicist"" and ""Genius Class."""
"While it worked, he dictated to his steno-robot the following brief"
message:
Dear Fellow Scientist:
A project is contemplated that will have a crucial bearing on man's
future in deep space. Ample non-military Government funds are
available. There was a time when professional men scoffed at the
Thinkers. Then there was a time when the Thinkers perforce neglected
the professional men. Now both times are past. May they never
"return! I would like to consult you this afternoon, three o'clock"

Meanwhile the who?-where? had tossed out a dozen cards. He glanced
"through them, hesitated at the name ""Willard Farquar,"" looked at the"
"sleeping girl, then quickly tossed them all into the addresso-robot and"
plugged in the steno-robot.
The buzz-light blinked green and he switched the phone to audio.
"""The President is waiting to see Maizie, sir,"" a clear feminine voice"

But the butcher of Tortosa could be as simple and direct in his methods
as even Rollo himself.
"""Will you give it to me?"" he said, still admiring it as it flashed upon"
his finger.
"Etienne looked at the general calmly from head to foot, Concha all the"
time frowning upon him to warn him of his danger. But the young man was
"preening himself like a little bantam-cock of vanity, glad to be"
reckless under the fire of such eyes. He would not have missed the
"chance for worlds, so he replied serenely, ""Do you still intend to shoot"
"us?"""
"""What has that to do with the matter?"" growled Cabrera, who was losing"
his temper.
"""Because if you do,"" said Etienne, who had been waiting his opportunity,"
"""you are welcome to the jewel--_after_ I am dead. But if I am to live, I"
"shall require it for myself!"""

THE BURNING OF THE MILL-HOUSE
"Cabrera bit his lip for a moment, frowned still more darkly, and then"
together in the room where Yolande was lying.
"""This is a most curious case, my dear Trepard,"" began Dick, speaking in"
"French--""a case of coma, which I have mistaken for death;"" and,"
"continuing, he briefly explained how the patient had been found in a"
state so closely resembling death that he himself had been deceived.
"The old Frenchman placed his hand upon her heart, and, withdrawing it,"
said:
"""She's breathing now."""
"""Breathing!""  I echoed.  ""Then she is recovering!"""
"""Yes, old fellow,"" Dick replied, ""she is recovering--at least we hope we"
"shall save her.""  Then, turning to his colleague, he raised her hand and"
"pointed to the finger-nails, asking: ""Do you notice anything there?"""
"The other, adjusting his pince-nez, bent and examined, them one by one."
"""Yes,"" he answered at last.  ""A slight purple discoloration at the base"
"of the nails."""
"""And upon the lower lip does anything strike you as peculiar?"""
"""A yellow mark,"" he answered, after carefully inspecting the spot"
indicated.
"""And there?""  Deane asked, touching the mark upon the neck."
"""Very strange!"" ejaculated the elder man.  ""It is a most unusual case."""

_CORNERS OF ROME_
"They went back to the carriage, and having crossed through the centre of"
"Rome, got out in front of the Farnese Palace."
"“I will be out inside of ten minutes,” said Kennedy."
The Farnese Palace aroused great admiration in Cæsar; he had never
"passed it before. By one of the fountains in the _piazza,_ he stood"
"gazing at the huge square edifice, which seemed to him like a die cut"
from an immense block of stone.
"“This really gives me an impression of grandeur and force,” he said to"
himself. “What a splendid palace! It looks like an ancient knight in
"full armour, looking indifferently at everything, sure of his own"
worth.”
"Cæsar walked from one end of the _piazza_ to the other, absorbed in the"
majestic pile of stone.
Kennedy surprised him in his contemplation.
“Now will you say that you are a good philistine?”
"“Ah, well, this palace is magnificent. Here are grandeur, strength,"
overwhelming force.”
"“Yes, it is magnificent; but very uncomfortable, my French colleagues"
tell me.”

Tennyson and read aloud the idyll of Lancelot and Elaine. And the
"sea-wind blew about his head and fluttered the brown hair on the pillow,"
"and the log-fire blazed in the chimney, and the great dog slept, and a"
noontide hush was over all things. And Risca read the simple poem with
"the heart of the girl of fifteen, and forgot everything else in the"
world.
"When he had finished, the foolish eyes of both were moist. “The dead"
"oar'd by the dumb,” with the lily in her hand,--dead for the love of"
"Lancelot,--affected them both profoundly."
"“I think I should die, too, like that, Great High; Belovedest,” said"
"Stellamaris, “if any one I loved left me.”"
"“But what Lancelot is going to leave you, dear?” said John."
She shook the thistledown of sadness from her brow and laughed.
“You and Walter are the only Lancelots I've got.”
"“The devil 's in the child to-day,” said Risca to himself."
There was a short pause. Then Stella said:
"“Belovedest dear, what was the particular thing that Walter said you had"
to tell me?”
"“It 's of no consequence,” said John. “It will do to-morrow or the day"
after.”
"Stella started joyously,--as much as the rigid discipline of years would"

"Ramon Garcia had not abandoned hope, and why should he? When there was"
"anything to be done, none could be so alert as Rollo Blair."
"""I am El Sarria the outlaw,"" Ramon went on, ""and these are my"

"though Vaviloff understood well enough that he was his superior, he"

"him, and, forgetting for a moment the matter in hand, respectfully"
asked Petunikoff:
"""Where did you study?"""
"""In the technological institute.  Why?"" answered the other, smiling:"
"""Nothing.  Only ... excuse me!""  The soldier lowered his head, and then"
"suddenly exclaimed, ""What a splendid thing education is!"
"Science--light.  My brother, I am as stupid as an owl before the sun"
"...  Your honour, let us finish this job."""
With an air of decision he stretched out his hand to Petunikoff and
said:
"""Well, five hundred?"""
"""Not more than one hundred roubles, Egor Terentievitch."" Petunikoff"
"shrugged his shoulders as if sorry at being unable to give more, and"
touched the soldier's hairy hand with his long white fingers.  They
"soon ended the matter, for the soldier gave in quickly and met"
Petunikoff's wishes.  And when Vaviloff had received the hundred

It is very pleasant here at harvest time. Scythes are being sharpened in

"Twill and Naylo looked at one another, fencing with their eyes. Finally"
"Twill nodded and said, ""You say it, Regin."""

"""Then it is my contention that any moves we make against this race"
should be made before anybody down there gets such a detector and

"""Why?"" demanded Viggon Sarri."
"Regin Naylo looked at his commander. ""We're losing a technical"
advantage. Whether we go in with a benign and peaceful-looking air and

do it before anybody succeeds in making an infrawave space detector.
"""Yes--the diamonds. That's why we went out on the _Arabella_--"" In"
broken sentences Sidney told the story; she wanted Mr. Dugald to know
that they had cared most for the honor of Cape Cod!
"""And we found them--a big box--at least we _think_ it's the diamonds!"
"Cap'n Phin Davies says it's _something_ queer!"""
Dugald Allan's exclamation had much the character of an explosion.
"""_Diamonds!_ What nonsense! You've risked bereaving three homes for"
what is probably nothing more than a case of rum. If ever a girl needed
"a big brother to keep her in check, you do!"""
CHAPTER XXIII
DIAMONDS
During the early morning hours of that summer day that Sidney was
"destined never to forget, the girl passed through every emotion that a"
fifteen-year-old heart can suffer.
"First, to her dismay no one at the cottage had seemed to rejoice, as"
"the crowd on the wharf had rejoiced, at her rescue. When Mr. Dugald led"
her in Miss Vine was making coffee at the stove and all she said was:
"""Well, you're all right! Better go to bed now as quick as you can and"
"keep out from under foot."" Then Mr. Dugald had taken Pola back to the"
hotel. Aunt Achsa was with Doctor Blackwell and Lavender. Sidney had
tried to summon sufficient courage to ask Miss Vine's forbidding back
"between the eyes. As he pitched backward, arms flailing, he tumbled"
"against the others, giving Novosty time to fire again. With deadly"
accuracy he caught another in the chest.
"Kenji Nogami had already thrown himself on the thick hallway carpet,"
"safely avoiding the fusillade. The Russian bankers, too, had all hit"
"the floor, along with the MNB guards and the two couriers."
Then came a shot with a different sound--the dull thunk of a silencer.
"Novosty jerked in surprise, pain spreading through his eyes. The"
"silencer thunked again, and again."
"It was Vera Karanova. She was holding a small .22 caliber Walther PP,"
with a specially equipped silencer. And her aim was flawless. Novosty
had three slugs arranged neatly down the side of his head before he
"even realized what was happening. He collapsed forward, never knowing"
whose hand had been on the gun.
"She's probably wanted to get rid of him for years, Vance thought"
"fleetingly. She finally got her golden opportunity, the double-crossing"
bitch.
He briefly considered grabbing back one of the .38's and avenging Alex
"then and there, but he knew it would be suicidal."
"""Alex, no!"" Eva's voice sobbed."
"""Both of you, hands on the wall."" Comrade Karanova was definitely in"
charge.
"""Michael,"" Eva said, turning to comply, ""what happened to our well-laid"
"plans?"""
"“Oh, don't you?” cried Sir Oliver, in sinister exultation. “Then your"
whole historical fabric of the Crucifixion must fall to the ground.”
"“I don't see why you need be irreverent and blasphemous,” said Lady"
Blount.
"Herold laid his hand on Lady Blount's and looked at her, with his head"
on one side.
"“But do you believe in Stellamaris, Julia.”"
"His smile was so winning, with its touch of mockery, that she grew"
mollified.
"“I believe she has bewitched all of us,” she said."
Which shows how any woman may be made to eat her words just by a little
kindness.
"So the talk went back to Stella and her ways and her oddities, and the"
question of faith in Pontius Pilate being necessary for salvation was
"forgotten. A maid, Stella's own maid, came in with a message. Miss"
"Stella's compliments, and were Mr. Risca and Mr. Herold having a good"
"supper? She herself was about to drink her egg beaten up in sherry, and"
would be glad if the gentlemen would take a glass of wine with her.
"The young men, accordingly, raised their glasses toward the ceiling and"
"drank to Stella, in the presence of the maid, and gave her appropriate"
messages to take back to her mistress.

some light on it.”
The clang of an ambulance bell outside told that the aid summoned by
Winters had arrived.
We left the body in charge of the surgeon and of a policeman who
"arrived about the same time, and followed Winters."
Muller lived in a cheap boarding house in a shabbily respectable street
"downtown, and without announcing ourselves we climbed the stairs to his"
room. He looked up surprised but not disconcerted as we entered.
“What’s the matter?” he asked.
"“Muller,” shot out Winters, “we have just found Mr. Schloss dead!”"
“D-dead!” he stammered.
The man seemed speechless with horror.
"“Yes, and with his grips packed as if to run away.”"
"Muller looked dazedly from one of us to the other, but shut up like a"
clam.
"“I think you had better come along with us as a material witness,”"
burst out Winters roughly.
"Kennedy said nothing, leaving that sort of third degree work to the"
"detective. But he was not idle, as Winters tried to extract more than"
"the monosyllables, “I don’t know,” in answer to every inquiry of Muller"
about his employer’s life and business.
"was disloyal and had come there with hostile intent, but because she"
felt that she must be absolutely sure of her ground before she revealed
the fact that Johnson was in the cabin. She let some moments pass before
she replied:
"""I don't know nothin' about your master. Who is he?"""
An indulgent smile crossed the Mexican's face.
"""That ver' good to tella other peoples; but I know 'im here too much."
"You trusta me--me quita safe."""
All this was said with many gestures and an air that convinced the Girl
that he was speaking the truth. But since she deemed it best that the
"invalid should be kept from any excitement, she resolved to make the"
Mexican divulge to her the nature of his important errand.
"""How do you know he's here?"" she began warily. ""What do you want 'im"
"for?"""
The Mexican's shifty eyes wandered all over the room as if to make
certain that no inimical ears were listening; then he whispered:
"""I tella you something--you lika the _Maestro_?"""
"Unconsciously the Girl nodded, which evidently satisfied the Mexican,"
for he went on:
"""You thinka well of him--yees. Now I tella you something. The man Pedro"
'e no good. 'E wisha the reward--the money for Ramerrez. 'E and the
"woman--woman no good--tell Meester Ashby they thinka 'im 'ere."""
"""What's the use of crossing bridges,"" Tommy grinned. ""If he won't"
"persuade, then sit on his head--anything, I don't care! The main thing"
"is--keep him!"""
CHAPTER III
THE GIRL IN THE CAFÉ
"Next morning began the conversion, or rather the persuasion, of Monsieur"
Dragot to remain a while longer with the _Whim_. Pete started off with
another triumphant breakfast and before our guest had gone far with it
his face was agleam with pleasure. Tommy and I put ourselves out to be
"agreeable, telling him jokes that sometimes registered but frequently"
"did not. Yet we were on most affable terms when, stuffed to repletion,"
we leaned back and lighted cigarettes.
"""Professor,"" Tommy suggested, ""I think if you stay with us you'll have a"
"better chance to find that child!"""
"Our guest beamed agreeably at the appelative, then looked toward me."
"""I'm sure of it,"" I said. ""We've nowhere to go but anywhere, and that"
"ought to fall in with your plans."""
"""_Pardieu_, you overwhelm me! You mean I may sail about with you,"
"searching?"""
"""Nothing simpler,"" I assured him. ""We've rather taken a fancy to you,"

"""I do not interfere in the councils of the Gitano,"" she cried; ""I am"
"old, but not old enough to desire death!"""
"But more grim and lack-lustre than ever, the face of Sergeant Cardono"
"was turned upon her, and more starrily twinkled the sloe-like eyes"
"(diamonds set in Cordovan leather) as he replied:--""The councils of the"
"Rom are as an open book to me. If they are life, they are life because I"
"will it; if death, then I will the death!"""
The old gipsy stared incredulously.
"""Long have I lived,"" she said, staring hard at the sergeant, ""much have"
"I seen, both of gipsy and Gorgio; but never have I seen or heard of the"
"man who could both make that boast, and make it good!"""
She appeared to consider a moment.
"""Save one,"" she added, ""and he is dead!"""
"""How did he die?"" said the Sergeant, his tanned visage like a mask, but"
never removing his eyes from her face.
"""By the _garrote_"" she answered, in a hushed whisper. ""I saw him die."""
"""Where?"""
"""In the great _plaza_ of Salamanca,"" she said, her eyes fixed in a stare"
"of regretful remembrance. ""It was filled from side to side, and the"
"balconies were peopled as for a bull-fight. Ah, he was a man!"""
"""His name?"""
was lying.  As we entered she lifted her hand slowly to me in sign of
"recognition, and in an instant I was at her side."
"""Yolande!""  I cried, taking her hand, so different now that death had"
"been defeated by life.  ""Yolande! my darling,"" I burst forth"
"involuntarily, ""you have come back to me!"""
"A sweet, glad smile spread over her beautiful face, leaving an"
"expression of calm and perfect contentment, as in a low, uncertain"
"voice, as though of one speaking afar off, she asked:"
"""Gerald, is it actually you?"""
"""Yes,"" I said, ""of course it is.  These two gentlemen are doctors,"" I"
"added.  ""This is my old friend Deane; and the other is Doctor Trepard,"
"of whom I daresay you have heard."""
She nodded to them both in acknowledgment of their kind expressions;
then in a few low words inquired what had happened to her.  She seemed
in utter ignorance of it all.
"""You were found lying on the floor of the little salon soon after I"
"left, and they thought you were dead,"" I explained.  ""Cannot you tell us"
"how it occurred?"""
"A puzzled expression settled upon her face, as though she were trying to"
remember.
"""I recollect nothing,"" she declared."
"""But you surely remember how you were attacked?""  I urged."
of pure knowledge and Christian meekness in a near future speaks from
the preface of Erasmus's edition of the New Testament.
How clear did the future look in those years! In this period Erasmus
"repeatedly reverts to the glad motif of a golden age, which is on the"
point of dawning. Perennial peace is before the door. The highest
"princes of the world, Francis I of France, Charles, King of Spain, Henry"
"VIII of England, and the emperor Maximilian have ensured peace by the"
strongest ties. Uprightness and Christian piety will flourish together
with the revival of letters and the sciences. As at a given signal the
mightiest minds conspire to restore a high standard of culture. We may
"congratulate the age, it will be a golden one."
But Erasmus does not sound this note long. It is heard for the last time
in 1519; after which the dream of universal happiness about to dawn
gives place to the usual complaint about the badness of the times
everywhere.

CHAPTER XII
ERASMUS'S MIND
"""It was that fool Rochester who set the rumor afloat."""
"After standing through an awkward minute or two, Castlemain bowed stiffly"
"to the king and the duchess, turned away from our group, and soon left"
the ballroom.
"When Castlemain was gone, we all laughed save the king. Presently he left"
"us, and I saw him beckon Wentworth and Berkeley to his side. I followed"
"him as though going to the other side of the gallery, but walked slowly"
when I approached him and the two worthy villains. I was rewarded by
hearing his Majesty say:--
"""Odds fish! But you made a mess of it! You got the wrong woman! Who in"
"the devil's name did you pick up?"""
"I could not stop to hear the rest of this interesting conversation, but"
"two days later I heard from Rochester, who had it from Wentworth, that"
the following occurred:--
"""We thought we had her,"" answered Berkeley, nodding towards Frances, ""but"
"the woman wore a full vizard and was wrapped in furs to her ears, so that"
"we did not see her face."""
"""Do you suppose we could have made a mistake?"" asked Wentworth."
"""You surely did,"" answered the king. ""She has established an alibi. At"
"what hour did you leave Baynard's Castle?"""
"""Near one o'clock,"" returned Berkeley."
"""One o'clock! She was playing cards with the duchess till four,"""
"exclaimed the king, impatiently. ""You picked up the wrong woman. But"
"preparations for the night. He was about to make some remark, however,"
when to his well-attuned ears there came the sound of approaching
footsteps. In an instant he was standing in the parting made by the
"curtains, his face eager, animated, tense."
"""What's that?"" he whispered."
"""That's snow slidin',"" the Girl informed him without the slightest trace"
of anxiety in her voice.
"""God bless you, Girl,"" he murmured, and retreated back of the curtains."
"It was only an instant before he was back again with: ""Why, there is"
"something out there--sounded like people calling,"" he again whispered."
"""That's only the wind,"" she said, adding as she drew her robe tightly"
"about her: ""Gettin' cold, ain't it?"""
"But, notwithstanding her assurances, Johnson did not feel secure, and it"
was with many misgivings that he now directed his footsteps towards the
bed behind the curtains.
"""Good-night!"" he said uneasily."
"""Good-night!"" unconsciously returned the Girl in the same tone."
Taking off her slippers the Girl now put on a pair of moccasins and
"quietly went over to her bed, where she knelt down and made a silent"
prayer.
"""Good-night!"" presently came from a little voice in the rug."
"""Good-night!"" answered the man now settled in the centre of the"
and said to the eating-house keeper:
"""Egor Terentievitch Vaviloff?  Are you he?"""
"""I am,"" answered the sergeant, leaning on the bar with both arms as if"
intending to jump over it.
"""I have some business with you,"" said Petunikoff."
"""Delighted.  Please come this way to my private room."""
"They went in and sat down, the guest on the couch and his host on the"
chair opposite to him.  In one corner a lamp was burning before a
"gigantic icon, and on the wall at the other side there were several oil"
"lamps.  They were well kept and shone as if they were new.  The room,"
"which contained a number of boxes and a variety of furniture, smelt of"
"tobacco, sour cabbage, and olive oil.  Petunikoff looked around him and"
"made a face.  Vaviloff looked at the icon, and then they looked"
"simultaneously at one another, and both seemed to be favourably"
"impressed.  Petunikoff liked Vaviloff's frankly thievish eyes, and"
"Vaviloff was pleased with the open, cold, determined face of"
"Petunikoff, with its large cheeks and white teeth."
"""Of course you already know me, and I presume you guess what I am going"
"to say to you,"" began Petunikoff."
"""About the lawsuit? ... I presume?"" remarked the ex-sergeant,"
respectfully.
"""Exactly!  I am glad to see that you are not beating about the bush,"
"but going straight to the point like a business man,"" said Petunikoff,"
encouragingly.

"The accident became widely known. Newspapermen came from the city, and"
Solem had to pilot them up the mountain and show them the spot where it
"had taken place. If the body had not been removed at once, they would have"
"written about that, too."
Children and ignoramuses might be inclined to think it foolish that Solem
"should be taken from the work in the fields at harvest time, but must not"
the business of the tourist resort go before all else?
"""Solem, tourists!"" someone called to him. And Solem left his work. A flock"
"of reporters surrounded him, asked him questions, made him take them to"
"the mountains, to the river. A phrase was coined at the farm for Solem's"
absences:
"""Solem's with death."""
"But Solem was by no means with death; on the contrary, he was in the very"
"midst of life, enjoying himself, thriving. Once again he was an important"
"personage, listened to by strangers, doling out information. Nor did his"
"audience now consist of ladies only--indeed, no; this was something new, a"
"change; these were keen, alert gentlemen from the city."
"To me, Solem said:"
"""Funny the accident should have happened just when the scratch on my nail"
"has grown out, isn't it?"""
"in slashed clothes, which were parti-coloured, red, yellow, and black."
Some of them carried lances and others swords.
“Why are the guards here dressed differently?” asked Cæsar.
“Because this belongs to the Dominions of the Pope.”
“And what kind of guards are these?”
“These are pontifical Swiss guards.”
"“They look comic-opera enough,” said Cæsar."
"“My dear man, don’t say that. This costume was designed by no one less"
than Michelangelo.”
"“All right. At that time they probably looked very well, but now they"
have a theatrical effect.”
"“It is because you have no veneration. If you were reverential, they"
would look wonderful to you.”
"“Very well, let us wait and see whether reverence will not spring up in"
"me. Now, you go on and explain what there is here.”"
"“This first room, the Hall of Audience, or of the Popes, does not"
"contain anything notable, as you see,” said Kennedy; “the five we are"
"coming to later, have been restored, but are still the same as at the"
time when your countryman Alexander VI was Pope. All five were decorated
"by Pinturicchio and his pupils, and all with reference to the Borgias."
"The Borgias have their history, not well known in all its details, and"
"their legend, which is more extensive and more picturesque. Really, it"
your watchfulness. I had full information of King Charles's design upon
"my life from no less a person than Monsieur le Grand himself, who showed"
me the letter asking that I be returned to England.
"""I explained to Monsieur le Grand that the English king sought my life,"
"not because he is in fear of me, but because he thought I stood between"
him and a lady who despises him. While Monsieur le Grand was much in
"sympathy with the English king's grievance, his contempt for Charles,"
"his regard for me, which seems to be sincere, and his longing to possess"
"Dunkirk all induced him to laugh at the request, the nature of which he"
had imparted to no one save me.
"""My account of the lady who despised King Charles's love gave Monsieur le"
"Grand a new idea, and suggested a method of purchasing Dunkirk which he"
hopes will save the heavy cost of bidding against the citizens of London.
I had no hint of what he intended till one day he took me to his closet
and began to question me.
"""'Do you possess the love of the lady who despises King Charles?' he"
asked.
"""'I do, your Majesty,' I answered."
"""'Do you know you possess it?' he asked."
"""'As well as a man who is not a king may know,' I returned."
"""'Tush, tush! Kings are no more certain than other men.'"
"""'I know I possess this woman's love,' I said."
"""'Would she be willing to make a great sacrifice to help you?'"
"truth, I was once a man, though I was not noble.  I care now for"
nothing and nobody ... and all my life has been tame--a sweetheart who
"has jilted me--therefore I despise life, and am indifferent to it."""
"""You lie!"" says Abyedok."
"""I lie?"" roars Aristid Kuvalda, almost crimson with anger."
"""Why shout?"" comes in the cold sad voice of Martyanoff."
"""Why judge others?  Merchants, noblemen ... what have we to do with"
"them?"""
"""Seeing that we are"" ... puts in Deacon Taras."
"""Be quiet, Abyedok,"" says the teacher, goodnaturedly."
"""Why do you provoke him?""  He does not love either discussion or noise,"
and when they quarrel all around him his lips form into a sickly
"grimace, and he endeavours quietly and reasonably to reconcile each"
"with the other, and if he does not succeed in this he leaves the"
"company. Knowing this, the Captain, if he is not very drunk, controls"
"himself, not wishing to lose, in the person of the teacher, one of the"
best of his listeners.
"""I repeat,"" he continues, in a quieter tone, ""that I see life in the"
"hands of enemies, not only enemies of the noble but of everything good,"
"avaricious and incapable of adorning existence in any way."""
"""But all the same,"" says the teacher, ""merchants, so to speak, created"
"Genoa, Venice, Holland--and all these were merchants, merchants from"
"England, India, the Stroyanoff merchants ..."""
"""Maybe he dropped the knife,"" said the watchman, and began to search"
"about the floor, followed by the others."
"""It may have been the woman herself who stabbed Mr. Marsh,"" offered"
"Emerson. ""He was strangling her when I arrived."""
"Roused by this statement to a fresh denial, Marsh cried out:"
"""I tell you there wasn't any woman."""
"""And there isn't any knife either,"" Emerson sneered."
The men paused uncertainly. Seeing that they were undecided whether to
"believe him or his assailant, Marsh went on:"
"""If he hasn't a knife, then he must have had a friend with him--"""
"""Then tell your men what we were doing in here and how you came to be"
"alone with us in the dark."" Emerson stared at his accuser curiously,"
"but the Trust's manager seemed at a loss. ""See here, Marsh, if you will"
"tell us whom you were choking, maybe we can get at the truth of this"
"affair."""
"Without answering, Marsh rose, and, leaning upon the watchman's arm,"
said:
"""Help me up to the house. I'm hurt. Send the launch to the upper plant"
"for John; he knows something about medicine."" With no further word, he"
"made his way out of the building, followed by the mystified fishermen."
"No one undertook to detain Emerson, and he went his way, wondering what"
lay back of the night's adventure. He racked his brain for a hint as to
The mortuary attendant came walking along the duckboards.
As he passed by me he growled:
"""There's a 'ell of a stunt on--there'll be umpteen slabs for the"
"mortuary."""
VI
AIR-RAIDS
"It was a warm, sunny afternoon. About a dozen of us were pitching a"
"marquee in leisurely fashion, when suddenly there was a shout of ""Fritz"
"up!"""
"We gazed at the sky, and, after searching for a while, saw a tiny white"
"speck moving slowly across the blue at an immense height. Then, at some"
"distance from it, a small white puff, like a little ball of cotton-wool,"
appeared. A few seconds passed and we heard a faint pop. More puffs
"appeared around the moving speck, each one followed by a pop. All at"
"once, behind us, a bright tongue of flame flashed out above a group of"
"bushes. There was a sharp report and a whizzing, rustling noise that"
died down gradually. Then another puff and another pop. The bright
flames flashed out again in rapid succession. The little speck moved on
and on. Grouped closely round it were compact little balls of
"cotton-wool, but trailing behind were thin wisps and semi-transparent"
whitish blurs. Above a belt of trees in the distance we observed a
the wardrobe top.
"In that same moment Johnson was standing in the parting of the curtains,"
his hand raised warningly. In another moment he was over to the door
"where, after taking his pistols from his overcoat pockets, he stood in a"
"cool, determined attitude, fingering his weapons."
"""But some one's ben callin',"" the Girl was saying, at the very moment"
when above the loud roaring of the wind another knock was heard on the
"cabin door. ""Who can it be?"" she asked as if to herself, and calmly went"
"over to the table, where she took up the candle and lit it."
"Springing to her side, Johnson whispered tensely:"
"""Don't answer--you can't let anyone in--they wouldn't understand."""
The Girl eyed him quizzically.
"""Understand what?"" And before he had time to explain, much less to check"
"her, she was standing at the window, candle in hand, peering out into"
the night.
"""Why, it's the posse!"" she cried, wheeling round suddenly. ""How did they"
"ever risk it in this storm?"""
At these words a crushed expression appeared on Johnson's countenance;
"an uncanny sense of insecurity seized him. Once more the loud, insistent"
"pounding was repeated, and as before, the outlaw, his hands on his guns,"
commanded her not to answer.
"""But what on earth do the boys want?"" inquired the Girl, seemingly"
"oblivious to what he was saying. Indeed, so much so that as the voice of"
commoners unless raised in rank by marriage or merit.
(_f_) The title _Lady_ belongs to daughters of all noblemen not lower
than earl.
(_g_) The title _Hon._ belongs to daughters of viscounts and barons;
"also to an untitled woman who becomes a maid-of-honor to the Queen,"
and this title is retained after she leaves the service. If a woman who
has the title _Lady_ becomes maid-of-honor she does not acquire the
title _Hon._
Index compound names according to the usage of the author's
"fatherland, though if it is known that his practice differs from"
"this usage, his preference should be followed. Compound names"
then go:
"(_a_) If English, under the last part of the name, when the first has"
"not been used alone by the author: e.g., _Gould, Sabine Baring-_;"
"but _Halliwell (afterwards Halliwell-Phillipps), J. O._, and _Locker"
"(afterwards Locker-Lampson)_, because they are well-known under the"
first names.
"(_b_) If foreign, under the first part."
Both such compound names as _Gentil-Bernard_ and such as _Gentil de
"Chavagnac_. There are various exceptions, when a name has been more"
"known under the last part, as _Fénelon_, not _Salignac de Lamothe"
"Fénelon_; _Voltaire_, not _Arouet de Voltaire_; _Sternberg_, not"
"_Ungern-Sternberg_. Moreover, it is not always easy to determine"
what is a compound surname in French. Cross-references are necessary
"whichever way one decides each case, especially when the second part"
Rippley slapped him on the shoulder:
"“Then,” said he, “we ought to give Pangbutt’s house an air. There"
is a lack of the grand manner here. One man-servant is ridiculously
inadequate. At least three of us ought to assist to wait on the guests.
"Doome and Fluffy and I and--and you, Blotte--would make a ripping lot"
"of waiters, and it wouldn’t be half so slow as talking art and rot"
to people who don’t know.... Genius shall serve the mob. This night
"must never be forgotten. By Macready, yes--Pangbutt used to play at"
play-acting! But where are his properties?”
Blotte was striding the room; he laughed:
"“Ay, ay--the gala-night of life should be gay and joyous,” cried"
"he--“all the candles lit, as for a bridal.” He came to a halt, scowled"
"at the dark hollow of the great doorway, and strode thither."
The old butler was lurking suspiciously outside.
"Blotte grabbed him by his coat lapel, and drew him into the light:"
"“Hireling fellow,” said he, “bring more lights. This place is like a"
damned omnibus.”
The old butler held out an expostulant palm in dignified remonstrance:
"“Gentlemen, gentlemen--the guests will be arriving in a few minutes----”"
"Rippley went up to him, and gripping his fingers in the old servant’s"
"waistcoat, pulled him into the room."
"“Don’t talk like an unfrocked bishop, Dukes--it’s most irreligious,”"
they walked along the waterfront fishermen and tourists and boys and
girls stared and nodded and Sidney's sensitive soul mistook their
obvious interest for ridicule. She walked with lowered eyes lest she
encounter Mrs. Calkins or Pola's mother.
Cap'n Phin was waiting outside the door of the shed on Rockman's wharf.
He nodded to Sidney and Trude and beckoned them inside. At any other
"time, in any other state of mind, Sidney would have thrilled to his air"
of mystery.
Four men sat in wooden chairs tipped at various angles and on the floor
before them stood the wooden box from the _Arabella_. The men nodded
and smiled at Sidney and brought their chairs to the floor as though to
attention.
Cap'n Davies solemnly motioned Sidney and Trude to two vacant chairs
and then cleared his throat.
"""I cal'late, Miss Sidney, that you've a sort o' interest in this cargo"
we brought in on the _Sally_ so we stood by 'til you hove in sight.
"Now, mebbe it's what we think it is and mebbe it isn't. Si, give a hand"
"and unload."""
One of the men knelt down by the box and proceeded to open it with a
hammer and a chisel. The others leaned forward with interest. Sidney
held her breath.
"The man Si, having torn off the cover, put his hands into the paper"
wrappings and drew forth yards and yards of magnificently embroidered
fabric that made Sidney and Trude gasp in admiration and astonishment.
But the others were plainly disappointed. A low murmur of disgust went
around the room.
"keeping his eye vigilantly on his fellow guard, who, having seated"
"himself in the window-sill, had dozed off to sleep, the cigarette still"
"drooping from the corner of his mouth. Yes, he was certainly asleep."
"He held out his hand to Etienne, who readily gave him the last he had"
"rolled. The sentry thanked him with a quick martial salute, and after a"
"turn or two more, deftly dropped the crumbled tobacco upon the floor and"
let the leaf drop on Rollo's knees with a stump of pencil rolled up in
it.
"Then the young man, turning his back upon the dozing guard in the stone"
"window-sill, wrote with some difficulty the following note, lying on his"
breast and using the uneven floor of the granary for a desk.
"""Little Concha"" (it ran), ""we are General Cabrera's prisoners."
Bring the papers as soon as you receive this. Otherwise we are
"to be shot at day-break.--ROLLO BLAIR."""
"There was still a little space left upon the leaf of Alcoy paper, and"
"with a half shamefaced glance at El Sarria, he added, ""_And in any case"
"do not wholly forget R. B._"""
"He passed the note to the outlaw, who folded it to the size of a postage"
stamp and apparently gave directions where and to whom it was to be
delivered.
"""In half an hour we shall be relieved and I will go,"" said the Carlist"
"ex-Miguelete, and resumed his steady tramp. Presently he awoke his"
comrade so that he might not be found asleep at the change of guard.

"""Take this lady and her maid straight up to the suite next mine,"""
"ordered Slyne as Sallie alighted, while Captain Dove listened, all ears."
"""And ask Mr. Jobling to join me in my sitting-room. He's still here, I"
"suppose?"""
"He gave vent to a heartfelt sigh of relief as the man, already preceding"
"his charges indoors, paused to answer in the affirmative."
"""I needn't book a room for you,"" he told Captain Dove, with calculated"
"indifference. ""But Sallie must have somewhere to leave Ambrizette."
"""Hey! you. Call my chauffeur to take the car round to the garage."""
"Captain Dove followed him toward the bureau, attracting not a few"
glances of mingled surprise and amusement from the elaborate idlers in
its neighbourhood. Slyne was furious.
"""I can't have him tagging about after me in that ghastly get-up!"" he"
told himself on the way to the elevator; and cuffed the elevator-boy's
ears at the sound of a mirthful sneeze with which that unfortunate youth
"had become afflicted. ""Though how the deuce I'm to help myself I don't"
"know."""
In the corridor at which they got out he caught sight of Mr. Jobling
"approaching, and hurried Captain Dove into the sitting-room of his"
suite.
"""Give me five minutes to change my clothes,"" he requested of the old"
"man. ""And don't get straying about, or you'll lose yourself."""
Mr. Jobling met him on the threshold as he shut the door. That gentleman
revolver rang out at precisely the same moment. There was a yell of
"fury, followed by a crash. Then almost oppressive silence."
"Bob was on his feet like a cat, fingers gripping the automatic he had"
"snatched from the owner’s nerveless hand. His jaw was hard, and there"
was a glint of more than anger in the eyes he bent upon Joyce’s
supporters hurrying up to the aid of their chief.
"“Hands up!” he cried out harshly, “Quick!”"
"He did not have to speak twice. There was something in his voice,"
"coupled with an emphatic gesture with the automatic, which made those"
"six men, big and powerful as they were, obey him with remarkable"
unanimity.
"“Take their guns, Jack,” continued Bainbridge, in that same commanding"
voice.
"Peters stepped forward to obey. The first man drew back instinctively,"
and started to pull down the hand which held a revolver. Without an
instant’s hesitation Bob fired. The bullet struck the upraised weapon on
"its blued-steel barrel, wringing a cry of surprise and pain from the"
fellow’s lips as he dropped the gun.
"There was no more trouble after that, Peters collected four revolvers"
and two Remingtons. Then he glanced questioningly at Bainbridge.
"“Throw ’em in the river,” the latter commander curtly. “’Way out in the"
"middle, where they can’t be recovered.”"
"The riverman walked a few steps toward the bank; then, pausing, he"
glanced back at the straight young figure standing behind him.
serious and convincing tone that the sergeant's eyes burned with
"curiosity, and, telling him that he would see if the papers were in his"
"desk, he went through the door behind the bar.  Two minutes later he"
"returned with the papers in his hand, and an expression of extreme"
astonishment on his face.
"""Here they are; the deeds about the damned houses!"""
"""Ah!  You ... vagabond!  And you pretend to have been a soldier, too!"""
"And Kuvalda did not cease to belabour him with his tongue, as he"
"snatched the blue parchment from his hands. Then, spreading the papers"
"out in front of him, and excited all the more by Vaviloff's"
"inquisitiveness, the Captain began reading and bellowing at the same"
"time.  At last he got up resolutely, and went to the door, leaving all"
"the papers on the bar, and saying to Vaviloff:"
"""Wait!  Don't lift them!"""
"Vaviloff gathered them up, put them into the cash-box, and locked it,"
"then felt the lock with his hand, to see if it were secure. After that,"
"he scratched his bald head, thoughtfully, and went up on the roof of"
the eating-house.  There he saw the Captain measuring the front of the
"house, and watched him anxiously, as he snapped his fingers, and began"
"measuring the same line over again. Vaviloff's face lit up suddenly,"
and he smiled happily.
"""Aristid Fomich, is it possible?"" he shouted, when the Captain came"
opposite to him.
"""Of course it is possible.  There is more than one short in the front"
"alone, and as to the depth I shall see immediately."""
"Vera Karanova stared at him, her dark eyes flooding with concern. ""But"
"you said the transaction was scheduled for Westminster Union Bank, this"
"morning at ten-thirty."""
"""That was merely a diversion."" Novosty leaned back. ""The actual"
"arrangement is turned around. For security reasons."""
"""I don't like this."" Her displeasure was obvious, and mounting. ""There"
"is no reason--"""
"""It's better, I assure you."" He withdrew a white tin of Balkan Sobranie"
"cigarettes from his coat, snapped it open, and withdrew one. Made of"
"fine Turkish Yenidje tobacco, they were what he always smoked on"
important days. This was an important day.
"As he flicked his lighter and drew in the first lungful of rich smoke,"
he thought about how much he hated the dark-haired woman seated beside
"him, dressed in a gray Armani business suit, sable coat, Cartier"
"jewelry. The bad blood between them traced back over five years, begin-"
ning with a T-Directorate reshuffle in which she'd moved up to the
"number three slot, cutting him out of a well-deserved promotion. The"
rumor going around Dzerzhinsky Square was that she'd done it by making
"the right connections, so to speak. It was the kind of in-house screw-"
"job Alex Novosty didn't soon forget, of forgive."
"Their black limo was now passing the Royal Courts of Justice, on the"
"left, headed onto Fleet Street. Ahead was Cannon Street, which"
intersected the end of Saint Swithins Lane. Just a few blocks more.
"After today, he fully intended never to see her again."

"“Now, these ginks will be watching me every minute, waiting for a chance"
"to shoot. You may catch them off their guard directly and when you do,"
cut and run!”
“So that’s what you did all the talking for?” queried Jack.
"“You bet!” answered Frank. “And while you’re running, I’ll do a little"
sprinting myself.”
"“Here, you!” shouted the leader, almost lifting Frank’s feet from the"
ground as he dragged him away.
“What were you whispering to that boy?” demanded one of the others.
"“I was telling him,” Frank answered, making an insulting face, “that I"
used to have a dog that looked exactly like you.”
The fellow thus insulted sprang for the boy with upraised fist. The
"leader blocked his rush by imposing his own burly form, and the two went"
"down together. The half-breeds sprang forward, too, the intention"
evidently being to assist their companion as against the leader.
"Frank let out a yell which might have been heard half a mile away, and"
"the three boys darted down the mountainside, followed by harmless shots"
from the guns of the half-breeds.
The incident had taken place on a rocky level flanked by steep slopes on
"each side. The place, in fact, was almost like a shelf of rock cut into"
a long fifty percent grade.
"""But how do the plates function?"""

"Greca did not know this, save vaguely. She tried to express her little"
knowledge of the scientific achievements of the savage Rogans. After
some moments Brand turned to Dex and said:
"""As near as I can get it, the Rogans, by this peculiar red metal"
"alloy, manage to trap and divert the permanent lines of force, the"
"magnetic field, of Jupiter itself. So the whole red spot is highly"
"magnetized, which somehow upsets natural gravitational attraction. I"
"suppose it is responsible for the discoloration of the ground, too."""
"He turned to question the girl further about this, but she had got"
nervously to her feet already.
"""I'll be taken away soon,"" she said. ""I was brought in here only to"
"urge you to eat the food. I must be interpreter, since the Rogans"
"speak not with the mind, and I know their hateful tongue."""
"""Why are they so anxious for us to eat?"" demanded Dex with an uneasy"
frown.
"""So you will be strong, and endure for a long time the--the ordeal"
"they have in store for you,"" faltered the girl at last. ""They intend"
"to force from you the secret of the power that drove your ship here,"
"so they too may have command of space."""
"""But I don't understand,"" frowned Brand. ""They must already have a"
means of space navigation. They came here to Jupiter from the
matters worse Manufacturer Brede had said he would withdraw his money....
Paul's careworn face looked out of the kitchen door. Before going out
"himself he wanted to make sure there was no one about, but he was"
"disappointed in this, for the lawyer at once greeted him loudly: ""Good"
"evening, Paul!"" and drew him outside."
They strolled down the field in the dusk.
"Assuredly there is little to be gained by ""having a good talk"" with a man"
about his drinking; such matters are too vital to be settled by talking.
"But Paul seems to have admitted that the lawyer was right in all he said,"
and probably left him with good resolutions.
Paul went down to the village again. He was going to the post office; the
money he had from the seven departed guests would be scattered to all
quarters of the globe. And yet it was not enough to cover everything--in
"fact not enough for anything, for interest, repayments, taxes, and"
repairs. It paid only for a few cases of food from the city. And of course
he stopped the case of sirup from going back.
Paul returned blind-drunk because he no longer wished to see. It was the
same thing all over again. But his brain seemed in its own way to go on
"searching for a solution, and one day he asked the lawyer:"
"""What do you call those square glass jars for keeping small fish"
"in--goldfish?"""
"""Do you mean an aquarium?"""
"""That's it,"" said Paul. ""Are they dear?"""
"I reflected for a moment, then in a calm voice answered:"
"""Because I discovered that her heart was not wholly mine."""
She regarded me with undisguised amazement.
"""Do you mean that Yolande had another lover?"""
"""No!""  I cried with sudden resolve.  ""This conversation is not fair to"
"her.  It is all finished.  She has forgotten, and we are both happy."""
"""Happy!"" cried the Countess hoarsely.  ""You are, alas! mistaken.  Poor"
Yolande has been the most unhappy girl in all the world.  She has never
"ceased to think of you."""
"""Then I regret, madame,"" I responded."
"""If you really regret,"" she answered, ""then your love for her is not"
"altogether dead."""
"She spoke the truth.  At this point I may as well confide to you, my"
"reader, the fact that I still regarded my charming little friend of"
those careless days of buoyant youth with a feeling very nearly akin to
love.  I recollected the painful circumstances which led to our parting.
"My memory drifted back to that well-remembered, breathless summer's"
"evening when, while walking with her along the white highway near her"
"home, I charged her with friendliness towards a man whose reputation in"
"Brussels was none of the best; of her tearful protests, of my"
"all-consuming jealousy, of her subsequent dignity, and of our parting."
"After that I had applied to the Foreign Office to be transferred, and a"
month later found myself in Rome.
"law begins; the books get written up later."""
"""You're going to _tell_, Ferdinand, what evil, criminal male is"
"speaking through your mouth!"""
"""Nobody!"" I insisted. ""They're my own ideas!"""
"""They are remarkably well-organized for a young boy's ideas. A boy"
"who, I might add, has previously shown a ridiculous but nonetheless"
entirely masculine boredom with political philosophy. I plan to have a
"government career on that new planet you talk about, Ferdinand--after"
"I have found a good, steady husband, of course--and I don't look"
"forward to a masculinist radical in the family. Now, who has been"
"filling your head with all this nonsense?"""
*       *       *       *       *
I was sweating. Sis has that deadly bulldog approach when she feels
someone is lying. I pulled my pulpast handkerchief from my pocket to
wipe my face. Something rattled to the floor.
"""What is this picture of me doing in your pocket, Ferdinand?"""
"A trap seemed to be hinging noisily into place. ""One of the passengers"
"wanted to see how you looked in a bathing suit."""
"""The passengers on this ship are all female. I can't imagine any of"
"them that curious about my appearance. Ferdinand, it's a man who has"
"been giving you these anti-social ideas, isn't it? A war-mongering"
masculinist like all the frustrated men who want to engage in
"government and don't have the vaguest idea how to. Except, of course,"
"in their ancient, bloody ways. Ferdinand, who has been perverting that"
sulky self-respect which would have carried him creditably to the altar
in any English church.
"Etienne faced his death like the son of an ancient race, and a good"
"Catholic. He could not have a confessor, but he said his prayers,"
"committed his soul to God and the Virgin, and faced the black muzzles"
not greatly abashed.
"As for El Sarria, death was his _métier_, his familiar friend. He had"
"lived with him for years, as a man with a wife, rising up and lying"
"down, eating and breathing in his company. ""The fortune of war,"" as"
Cabrera said. El Sarria was ready. Dolóres and her babe were safe. He
asked no more.
And not less readily fell into line Rollo Blair. A little apart he stood
as they made ready to march out of the presence of the Carlist general.
"John Mortimer was already on his way, carefully and conscientiously"
"ordering his going, that he might not in these last things disgrace his"
nation and his upbringing. Etienne and Ramon were following him. Still
"the young Scot lingered. Cabrera, nervously fingering his accoutrement"
"and signing papers at a folding table, found time to eye him with"
curiosity.
"""Did he mean to make a last plea for mercy?"" he thought."
Cabrera smiled contemptuously. A friend of Nogueras might know Ramon
Cabrera of Tortosa better. But Rollo had no such thought. He had in his
"fingers Etienne's last slip of Alcoy paper, in which the cigarette of"
"Spain, unfailing comforter, is wrapped. To fill it he had crumbled his"
last leaf of tobacco. Now it was rolled accurately and with lingering
"particularity, because it was to be the last. It lay in his palm featly"
"made, a cigarette worthy to be smoked by Don Carlos himself."
"“This is up-to-date gambling in cleaned-up New York,” he remarked as we"
waited for the elevator to return for us. “And the worst of it all is
that it gets the women as well as the men. Once they are caught in the
"net, they are the most powerful lure to men that the gamblers have yet"
devised.”
"We rode down in silence, and as we went down the steps to the street, I"
"noticed the man whom we had seen watching the place, lurking down at"
the lower corner. Kennedy quickened his pace and came up behind him.
"“Why, Winters!” exclaimed Craig. “You here?”"
"“I might say the same to you,” grinned the detective not displeased"
evidently that our trail had crossed his. “I suppose you are looking
"for Schloss, too. He’s up in the Recherche a great deal, playing poker."
I understand he owns an interest in the game up there.”
"Kennedy nodded, but said nothing."
“I just saw one of the cappers for the place go out before you went
in.”
“Capper?” repeated Kennedy surprised. “Antoinette Moulton a steerer for
a gambling joint? What can a rich society woman have to do with a place
like that or a man like Schloss?”
Winters smiled sardonically. “Society ladies to-day often get into
"scrapes of which their husbands know nothing,” he remarked. “You didn’t"
"know before that Antoinette Moulton, like many of her friends in the"
"smart set, was a gambler—and loser—did you?”"
Craig shook his head. He had more of human than scientific interest in
arrival of another squadron from Centauri. He found himself busy
readjusting the search pattern to accommodate this new contingent.
He eyed the pattern in the stereo and hoped it was good enough.
*       *       *       *       *
There was the basic aggregate of nine full squadrons spread out flat in
a space lattice that ran back and forth from narrow end to wide end of
the cone of probability. There was one full squadron of roving ships
"that went aimlessly back and forth across the pattern, just to cope"
with the happenstance factor.
One squadron was parked at either end of the search grid as space
"markers, with a computer ship at either end to maintain a constant"
check on their space coordinates. The big search pattern shuttled from
"one end to the other, and if they came back to miss the marker ships,"
they retraced their path so that no space went uncombed.
The infrawave chattered and Space Admiral Stone was calling for
Commodore Theodore Wilson.
"""How're you coming?"""
"Wilson replied, ""We're still at it, Admiral. So far we haven't seen"
"her."""
"""Don't forget, Wilson, there's more lost out there than the woman you"
"want."""
"Ted wanted to snap back angrily, but all he said was, ""You don't mind"
"if I take this search personally, do you, Admiral Stone? I'm not"
The tiny sun had leaped up over Jupiter's horizon; and with its
appearance they had sent the ship planing toward their mysterious
"destination. Beneath them the fog banks were thinning, and ahead of"
them were no clouds. For some reason there was a clarity unusual to
Jupiter's atmosphere in the air above the red section.
"""Red spot one mile ahead, altitude forty thousand feet,"" reported"
Brand.
He and Dex peered intently through the port glass panel. Ahead and far
"below, their eyes caught an odd metallic sheen. It was as though the"
ground there were carpeted with polished steel that reflected red
firelight.
"Tense, filled with an excitement that set their pulses pounding"
"wildly, they angled slowly down, nearer to the edge of the vast"
"crimson area, closer to the ground. The radio keened its monotonous"
signal.
"Brand crawled to the transmitter, laboriously, for his body tipped the"
scales here at nearly four hundred pounds.
"""We can see the metallic glitter that Journeyman spoke of,"" he said."
"""No sign of life of any kind, though. The red glow seems to flicker a"
"little."""
Closer the ship floated. Closer. To right and left of them for vast
distances stretched the red area. Ahead of them for hundreds of miles
they knew it extended.
"""We're right on it now,"" called Brand. ""Right on it--we're going over"
"the edge--we're--"""
"Wearily again, Commodore Wilson called Commander Hatch, who skippered"
one of the scout carriers. He told Hatch to make himself available
"either to Hugh Weston or Maury Allison, to investigate infrawave"
response targets as they saw fit.
Then Wilson hit the sack to finish his off-duty.
"He dozed fitfully, but he did not sleep worth a damn. He would have"
been better off if he could have taken the controls of one of the
"spacers and gone out himself. Then, at least, he would have something"
to fill his mind and idle hands....
Alice Hemingway awoke from a rather pleasant dream that had something
"to do with either ice skating or skiing, or it might have been"
tobogganing--the dream had faded so fast she could not be sure--to face
the fact that she was feeling on the chill side.
"Her blanket had slipped. She caught it around her, and in minutes"
"felt fairly warm again. It was not so much, she thought, the actual"
"temperature in the lifeship, but the whole damned attitude of people,"
and everything else that was so chilling.
"The lights were running all right, and from deep below she could hear"
the ragged throb of the pedal generator. She wondered which of the two
men was pumping it this time.
"When Jock Norton came in, she knew. He was mopping his face with a"
"towel. He looked clean and bright, freshly shaved."
"She looked at him and wished she could have a hot shower herself, and a"
change of clothing. She wanted a ten-hour sleep in a nice soft bed with
"clean sheets, too, and wearing a silk-soft nightgown."
When the three lads came to the finger of granite upon the top of which
"the two fires showed, they first made a careful examination of the"
thickets close by and then ascended to the top.
"“These fires were made to constitute a signal, all right!” Jack"
"declared, poking at the now dying embers."
"“Sure!” answered Frank. “You see, no cooking was done here, and there is"
no camp in sight.”
"“Besides, the position of the blazes on this high rock shows that the"
"fires were built so that the columns of smoke might be seen,” suggested"
"Harry. “It was Indian talk, all right!”"
"“Well, there’s no one here in need of help so far as I can see!” laughed"
"Jack, “and so we may as well go back to the camp.”"
"“That’s the thing to do,” Frank urged. “To tell the truth, I don’t feel"
exactly right about leaving Gilroy there alone.”
"“Aw, we’ll hear him sleeping before we get within a rod of the cave,”"
"laughed Jack. “Gilroy is a good old chap, and father thinks a lot of"
"him, but he doesn’t know much about this kind of a life. I’ll bet that"
"right now he’s dreaming about grizzly bears, and lions, and crocodiles,"
and panthers.”
"From their position in the forest, after their departure from the rock,"
they could see nothing of the signal from the north which had attracted
"Jimmie’s attention, so there seemed nothing for them to do but to return"
to camp. Therefore they set out at good speed.
XXIX
"Once more I was run into a party of English, the last for this year."
They arrived by steamer in the morning and stopped at the trading station
"for a few hours, meanwhile sending up a detachment through the valley to"
"order a car to meet them. Stordalen, Stordalen, they said. So they had"
apparently not yet seen Stordalen--an omission they must repair at once.
And what a sensation they made!
They came across by rowboat from the trading station; we could hear them a
"long way off, an old man's voice drowning out all the others. Eilert"
"dropped everything he had in hand, and ran down to the landing place in"
"order to be the first on the spot. From Olaus's house, too, a man and a"
"few half-grown boys went down, and from all the houses round swarmed"
curious and helpful crowds. There were so many spectators at the landing
place that the old man with the loud voice drew himself up to his full
"height in the boat and majestically shouted his English at us, as though"
his language must of course be ours as well:
"""Where's the car? Bring the car down!"""
"Olaus, who was sharp, guessed what he meant and at once sent his two boys"
"up the valley to meet the car and hurry it on, for the Englishmen had"
arrived.
"They disembarked, they were in a great hurry, they could not understand"
"why the car had not come to meet them: ""What was the meaning of this?"""
"There were four of them. ""Stordalen!"" they said. As they came up past"
and whispered in his ear. That young man exhibited proof of ability to
"act promptly. Crouching low, he slid over the edge of the car, hung"
"lightly for an instant, and then disappeared. Half a dozen of the"
"top-riders observed his feat, wonderingly, but made no comment, deeming"
it prudent not to express surprise at what might be the conventional
manner of alighting in this bewildering city. The truant passenger
"dodged a hansom and then floated past, like a leaf on a stream between"
a furniture van and a florist’s delivery wagon.
"The girl in the tan jacket turned again, and looked in the eyes of Mrs."
James Williams. Then she faced about and sat still while the Rubberneck
auto stopped at the flash of the badge under the coat of the
plainclothes man.
"“What’s eatin’ you?” demanded the megaphonist, abandoning his"
professional discourse for pure English.
"“Keep her at anchor for a minute,” ordered the officer. “There’s a man"
on board we want—a Philadelphia burglar called ‘Pinky’ McGuire. There
"he is on the back seat. Look out for the side, Donovan.”"
Donovan went to the hind wheel and looked up at James Williams.
"“Come down, old sport,” he said, pleasantly. “We’ve got you. Back to"
"Sleepytown for yours. It ain’t a bad idea, hidin’ on a Rubberneck,"
though. I’ll remember that.”
Softly through the megaphone came the advice of the conductor:
"“Better step off, sir, and explain. The car must proceed on its tour.”"
James Williams belonged among the level heads. With necessary slowness
"Accordingly, within four hours of receiving his appointment, Terence"
"bade his parent farewell and proceeded by rail to Devonport, where"
"the ""Sunderland"" was lying. It was nearly dark when he alighted at"
Millbay station. Here he called a taxi and was whirled off to the
"Dockyard, whence a picquet boat conveyed him to the cruiser, which"
was lying at a buoy in the Hamoaze.
"""We're off under sealed orders at six o'clock tomorrow morning,"""
"announced one of his new shipmates, a junior lieutenant, Teddy"
"Barracombe by name. ""Of course, we are quite in the dark, but there's"
a strong idea floating around that the ship's off to the Near East.
Just my mark! According to all accounts we'll be pretty busy in the
"Dardanelles."""
"""That's all very fine for you,"" commented Oswestry, the torpedo"
"lieutenant, ""but where do I come in? We can't use torpedoes against"
"fortifications, you know, and there's precious little floating about"
"for us to go for."""
"""Don't take on, Torps,"" said Barracombe cheerfully. ""You never know"
"your luck. Wait and see."""
"""I'd rather t'were the other way about,"" corrected Torps. ""Seeing"
your torpedo leave the tube and waiting for the enemy ship to be
blown up. No Dardanelles for me. So I hope to goodness it's the North
"Sea. By Jove, I do!"""
"As soon as the ""Sunderland"" was clear of the breakwater the momentous"
orders were opened. It was not to the Near East; the cruiser had to
proceed to Dover and await further instructions.
"second he stood in awkward silence, swallowing hard in his"
embarrassment. Then he raised his head again.
"“I don’t need your job,” he said, in a poor imitation of devil-may-care"
"defiance. “I’ll get my time, and----”"
Bainbridge cut him short. “You’ll get down to the drive and _work_. Beat
it now--quick!”
"Without another protesting word, Kollock turned meekly and obeyed."
CHAPTER XII. THE TEST
"Before he had taken a dozen steps, Kollock was furious with himself, and"
by the time Bainbridge was out of sight the wrath of the riverman had
risen to a white heat.
From the first he had tried to dislike Bainbridge. Pete Schaeffer had
"been his friend, and after he had been whipped Curly made up his mind"
that there could be no getting along in a crew bossed by the victor.
Then came that brief but pointed interview with Bob which affected him
so oddly. He had never before had anybody tell him that he was to be
"trusted; most bosses had been emphatic in saying the opposite thing. Or,"
"if they kept silent, they showed in a dozen obvious ways that they"
considered him in the same class with his notorious brother.
Then there was the incident of the day before. Curly could not help
admiring the manner in which Bainbridge had handled the crowd that was
trying to hold up the drive. It was exactly the sort of thing he would
"like to have done himself, and his heart warmed toward the man with the"
"courage and ability to act in that fashion. Moreover, Jack Joyce was an"
"After a short walk, Jack beckoned the boys to his side and suggested"
that they take a route to the camp different from that which they had
followed on leaving it.
"“You see, boys,” he explained, “that was a signal, all right, and we"
"haven’t found out the cause of it. So far as we know, it was put up to"
get us away from the camp.”
"“I’m beginning to think it was,” Frank announced. “Either to get us away"
"from the camp for the purpose of capturing us, or for the purpose of"
raiding our provisions.”
"“Well,” Jack went on, “if we duck away to the south and return to the"
"camp by a new course, anyone watching for us might watch in vain.”"
“That’s the idea!” Harry answered.
"“Then here we go the south,” Frank suggested, starting away at as swift"
a gait as was possible in the thicket.
They had proceeded but a short distance when every tree bole of good
size immediately in front of them seemed to their astonished eyes to
"yield a scowling, dirty half-breed. The boys drew their guns."
"“No use, lads!” a voice said, speaking in good English. “The men in the"
"bushes have you covered. Anyway, there’s no harm intended.”"
“Why the holdup?” demanded Jack.
The man who had spoken now advanced to Jack and looked him keenly in the
face. Although carrying the general appearance of the gang of
"half-breeds at his back, the boys could see by the fellow’s face and"
"kept the drive from jamming. He was hot and sweaty, and generally weary"
"as he continued his way downstream, and his wrath was naturally instant"
"when, on suddenly rounding a bend, he came upon Curly Kollock, cool,"
"calm, and unruffled, sitting comfortably on a rock, enjoying a"
cigarette.
"As the latter saw Bainbridge, he flushed slightly, and half rose from"
"the bowlder. Then, with a stubborn twist of his lips, he sank back"
"again, pulling hard on the cigarette, and doing his best to look"
unconcerned.
"Bob walked straight up to him, and stopped."
"“Well,” he said bitingly, “I’m sorry you’ve lost the use of your feet"
and hands. Is it paralysis?”
"Kollock’s flush deepened, and he mumbled something inane about taking a"
"smoke. He found that he had arisen, apparently without volition, and was"
"standing before the other man, who stared at him a long half minute."
"“This is no rest cure,” said Bob at length. “You’re paid for helping the"
"drive along. I don’t want any loafers in this gang. Understand? Now, get"
down to the head of the drive--and do something!”
"Kollock’s face was flaming, and his eyes gleamed angrily. “I don’t take"
"that line of talk from anybody!” he growled, clenching his fists"
threateningly. “I’ll----”
"“You’ll do what I said, and do it quick!” Bainbridge’s voice was not"
"raised above a conversational pitch, but there was a ring in it which"
seemed to take the fight and bluster out of the big riverman with the
effectiveness of a keen knife thrust into an inflated bladder. For a
"something a little suspicious about one of his eyes, and a squat,"
queerly-shaped old fellow in semi-clerical garb and wearing smoked
"glasses, completed the party. Their waiters began to hover about them,"
and the fashionable world went on with its dinner.
"""Who was that _lovely_ girl?"" the Duchess of Dawn demanded of her"
"_vis-à-vis_, the veteran soldier, and he, reputed among women to have no"
"heart at all, recalled himself with an evident start from the reverie"
"into which he had fallen. He almost blushed, indeed, under the duchess's"
blandly discerning smile.
"""I don't know, I'm sure, duchess,"" he returned, smiling also, in spite"
"of himself, and beckoned to a servant behind him, whom he despatched on"
some errand.
"""She's registered as Miss Harris, your lordship,"" the man announced in"
an undertone when he returned.
"""Miss Harris!"" echoed the prince, who was also a soldier. He had"
"overheard. And, as he in turn caught the duchess's eyes, he lay back"
"laughing, a little ruefully. But the man opposite him, the master of"
"armies, was not amused."
"""I'd like to know who and what those three fellows with Miss Harris may"
"be,"" said he."

"At their table in the corner, they seemed to be thoroughly enjoying"
themselves. The three men were toasting Sallie and each other with equal
good-will. And even Sallie had dismissed from her mind the last of her
lingering doubts as to the reality and endurance of her part in that
"""Oh--h, take me back to the cabin!"" moaned Pola."
"""I guess we might as well,"" muttered Mart. Their matches had been long"
since exhausted; they had been of little avail for the one ship's light
on the boat was without oil.
"One on each side of her, Mart and Sidney helped Pola down into the"
"cabin. The boat was rolling heavily now in the rough sea, each lift and"
drop sending terror to the three young hearts. In the blackness of the
night the waves looked mountain high. Even Mart was glad to shut them
from view.
"""If--if we're going to drown I'd rather drown in--a--room,"" gasped"
"Pola, clinging to Sidney and burying her face in Sidney's shoulder."
It seemed to the girls as though months had passed since Lav had
plunged to what they felt certain was his death. The _Arabella_ had
"tossed about on the roughening water like some wild thing, her old"
timbers creaking and groaning under their new living. Just at first
Sidney and Mart had been too concerned in quieting the panic-stricken
Pola to face their danger; not until Pola had exhausted herself did
they think of their possible fate.
"Unless Lav succeeded in reaching the beach and giving an alarm, they"
"might toss about for days or be dashed to pieces on some reef. Or,"
"worse fate, Jed Starrow and his gang might find the boat and--"
"""Wh-at are you thinking about, Mart?"" whispered Sidney after a long"
"time of silence, broken only by the howling of the wind and the"
"pounding of the water. ""Let's talk--and then we can't hear--"""
"""I win,"" he announced, briefly, his eyes alone betraying the inward"
"fever. He dropped the cards before her on the table. ""Three kings,--and"
"the _last hand_!"""
"Suddenly, as though some inward cord had snapped under the strain, the"
"Girl collapsed. Limply she slid downward in her chair, one groping hand"
"straying aimlessly to her forehead, then dropping of its own weight."
"""Quick, Jack,--I'm ill,--git me somethin'!"" The voice trailed off to"
nothingness as the drooping eyelids closed.
"In real consternation, the Sheriff sprang to his feet. In one sweeping"
"glance his alert eye caught the whisky bottle upon the mantel. ""All"
"right, Girl, I'll fix you in no time,"" he said cheeringly over his"
shoulder. But where the deuce did she keep her tumblers? The next minute
he was groping for them in the dark of the adjoining closet and softly
cursing himself for his own slowness.
"Instantaneously, the Girl came to life. The unturned cards upon the"
table vanished with one lightning movement; the Girl's hand disappeared
"beneath her skirts, raised for the moment knee-high; then the same,"
"swift reverse motion, and the cards were back in place, while the Girl's"
"eyes trembled shut again, to hide the light of triumph in them. A smile"
flickered on her lips as the Sheriff returned with the glass and bottle.
"""Never mind,--I'm better now,"" her lips shaped weakly."
"The Sheriff set down the bottle, and put his arm around the Girl with a"
rough tenderness.
"""Oh, you only fainted because you lost,"" he told her."
"Averting her gaze, the Girl quietly disengaged herself, rose to her feet"
"""Oh, there's nothing in it,"" said the watchmaker reassuringly. He had"
not a letter in his pocket.
"The doorkeeper opened his mouth to speak, but seeing his wife"
"approaching, he shut it again and busied himself with his meal."
"""What was the letter, Ned?"""
"""Oh, about the procession,"" he answered."
"""Then you got it too late. Who was it from?"""
"""If you'd give us the tea,"" he broke out roughly, ""and let the damned"
"letter alone, it 'ud be a deal better."""
"""La, you needn't fly out at a woman so,"" said Mrs. Evans. ""It ain't the"
"way to treat his wife, is it, mister?"""
"""Mister"" gallantly reproved his friend, but pleaded that they were both"
"weary, and weary legs made short tempers. Giving them the tea, she left"
them to themselves; her work was not finished till three small children
were safely in bed.
The sensation of having one's neck for the first time within measurable
"distance of a rope must needs be somewhat disquieting. The doorkeeper,"
"in spite of his secret society doings, was a timid man, with a vastly"
"respectful fear of the law. To talk about things, to vapour idly about"
"them over the cups, is very different from being actually, even though"
"remotely, mixed up in them. Ned Evans was a man of some education: he"
"read the papers, accounts of crimes and reports of trials; he had heard"
of accessories after and before the fact. Was he not an accessory after
"the fact? He fancied they did not hang such; but if they caught him, and"
"shut his mouth by and by, when I have more time to attend to such"
"matters."""
"""How much do you want?"" Slyne inquired with a frown evidently meant to"
warn his friend to be modest.
"""Can you spare twenty pounds--to go on with?"""
"Slyne hesitated, but only for a few seconds. Then he pulled out a"
pocket-book and surreptitiously passed that sum to the penniless man of
"law, who accepted it with no more than a nod of thanks."
"""I'll pay Mullins now,"" he remarked, and immediately hurried out of the"
room. Captain Dove was gasping for breath and showed every other symptom
of a forthcoming explosion.
"As soon as the door shut behind him, the old man gave open vent to his"
wrath. And a most furious quarrel followed between Slyne and him.
"Sallie, too, learned then, for the first time, of the vast inheritance"
"which would be hers, of Slyne's cunning plan to buy Captain Dove out for"
"a mere pittance, and how he himself expected to profit through marrying"
her.
But she was not overwhelmed with surprise by that belated discovery. She
had almost anticipated the final disclosure of some such latent motive
behind all Slyne's professions to her. The only difference it might make
would be to Captain Dove. Slyne and he were still snarling at each other
when Mr. Jobling walked jauntily in again. But at sight of him Captain
Dove began to subside.
"""We mustn't be late. Mr. Spettigrew will be expecting us now. I've sent"
"Mullins on ahead with my papers,"" observed Mr. Jobling breezily, and"
"“It was only natural on my part,” she said amiably. “I shall never"
"forget when poor Flossie died. You remember Flossie, don't you? She used"
"to look so pretty, with her blue bow in her hair, and no one will ever"
persuade me that she was n't poisoned by the people next door; they were
dreadful people. I wish I could remember their name; it was something
"like Blunks. Anyhow, I was inconsolable, and Mrs. Tawley asked me to"
stay with her to get over it. I shall never forget how grateful I
"was. I'm sure you 're looking quite poorly, John,” she added in her"
inconsequent way. “Let me get you a cup of tea. It will do you good.”
"John declined. He wanted to accomplish his errand, but the longer he"
"remained in the company of this lady devoid of the sense of values, the"
more absurd did that errand seem. A less obstinate man than he would
"have abandoned it, but John had made up his mind to act on Herold's"
"suggestion, although he mentally bespattered the suggester with varied"
"malediction. He rose and, making his way between the flimsy chairs and"
"tables, stood on the hearth-rug, his hands in his pockets. Unconsciously"
"he scowled at his placid and smiling aunt, who remained seated on the"
"couch, her helpless hands loosely folded on her lap."
“Did you ever hear of a child called Unity Blake?”
“Was that the girl--”
“Yes.”
“What an outlandish name! I often wonder how people come to give such
names to children.”
"“Never mind her name, my dear aunt,” said John, gruffly. “I want to tell"
you about her.”
I'm afraid the door of this little paradise might be shut to me after--
"Let's say this is my one hour--the hour that gave me--that kiss I want."""
"""Go long! You go to grass!"" returned the Girl with a nervous little"
laugh.
"Johnson made one more effort and won out; that is, he succeeded, at"
"last, in getting her in his grasp."
"""Listen,"" said the determined lover, pleading for a kiss as he would"
have pleaded for his very life.
"It was at this juncture that Wowkle, silently, stealthily, emerged from"
the cupboard and made her way over to the door. Her feet were heavily
moccasined and she was blanketed in a stout blanket of gay colouring.
"""Ugh--some snow!"" she muttered, as a gust of wind beat against her face"
"and drove great snow-flakes into the room, fairly taking her breath"
"away. But her words fell on deaf ears. For, oblivious to the storm that"
"was now raging outside, the youthful pair of lovers continued to"
concentrate their thoughts upon the storm that was raging within their
"own breasts, the Girl keeping up the struggle with herself, while the"
man urged her on as only he knew how.
"""Why, if I let you take one you'd take two,"" denied the Girl,"
"half-yielding by her very words, if she but knew it."
"""No, I wouldn't--I swear I wouldn't,"" promised the man with great"
earnestness.
"""Ugh--very bad!"" was the Indian woman's muffled ejaculation as she"
peered out into the night. But she had promised her lover to come to him
the fact that at one time I thought this passage beautiful. But the beat
of the blank verse carried me on. Sometimes it seemed to blend with the
buzzing of those angry wasps above and sometimes the two rhythms would
"vie with each other for speed, so that they hurried along each"
alternately ahead of the other. I came to a line where my memory failed
"me. I faltered for a moment, but the droning sound seemed to grow into"
"an enormous roar, and I leapt back to the beginning:"
"""He above the rest...."""
and then on and on a second time until my head throbbed with the double
pulsation.
Suddenly a man who had been lying on the far side of the marquee got up
and said:
"""I've had enough of this, I'm going to sleep in a ditch."""
"He went off. The wasps were still buzzing, but the interruption had"
broken the spell. I felt a sense of relief. I became conscious of
intense weariness and felt ashamed of my fears. I cursed the German
"aeroplanes and thought, ""Let them do their worst, I don't care."" I made"
up my mind to go to sleep and resolutely buried my face in my pillow.
Then it occurred to me that I would never be able to enjoy _Paradise
"Lost_ again, and I was half-amused and agreeably distracted by the"
trivial thought.
But the wasps were still buzzing. Another man began to groan loudly:
"""Gawd--this is bloody awful--why the bloody 'ell can't they leave us"
"alone!"""
"of the populous city, and its smoky shadow slowly followed it. The"
lights of the lamps paled in the dawn; the stars went out; and out of
the daffodil east the day came up--and there was light in the world.
"Before the day was well begun, Noll went home."

"In the still grey dawn, in dripping drizzle, Gavroche the anarchist"
slouched forth from prison-cell to his harsh doom.
He was dejected.
"He missed the band, the public eye, the shouts of the comrades."
"What, Gavroche! this is thy dramatic moment--thou hast the stage all to"
thy sole swaggering self--and though thou roused at daybreak from thy
broodings to lilt a braggart song with all thy best intent to play the
"reckless swashbuckler, the florid eager pressman can only report that"
thou didst sing “somewhat palsily.”
"Tush, man! Is it thus thou goest to thy end? Hath thy desire to be"
Ruthless Overman brought only this about--that thou art to become no
"better than manure? Where is now thy dream of Ruthless Overman? Nay,"
"what avails at all now thy Overmanhood, Gavroche? does not thy neck"
feel rather with unpleasant shiver of discomfort the overlordship
"of the Commonweal? The aristocrat despised it yesterday, and thou"
"to-day. Hast thou, even thus late, a glimmering that thy vaunted"
"Ruthless Brutality is to be snipped by the might of this Commonweal,"
thy unspeakable windpipe slit at a stroke of the ordered shear that
falls on the bidding of that overwhelming force which is the public
Thereupon his neighbour tried to create an impression by appearing calm
"and philosophical. He said in a strained, breaking voice:"
"""Think of all the waste in life and treasure this frightful war"
involves. Think of the moral degradation. Think of the widows and
"orphans. Think of the...."" He was unequal to the effort and his voice"
trailed away and then seemed to catch in his throat. But he recovered
"and with a kind of gasp he squeezed out a few more words: ""Bill, forgive"
"me for insulting you to-day--I didn't mean it, Bill. Forget it, Bill,"
"forget it! If you get killed without forgiving me, my conscience will"
"always torture...."""
"""For Christ's sake shut up, yer bleed'n' 'ypocrite,"" interrupted the"
"gruff voice of ""Bill"" somewhere out of the darkness. ""Yer always"
bleed'n' well preachin'--it's bad enough 'avin' Fritz over us without
"you bloody well rubbin' it in. If yer don't shut yer mouth, I'll come"
"over an' shut it for yer, 'struth I will."""
"The philosopher said no more, but another voice made itself heard, that"
"of a good-natured, elderly bachelor, who said with melancholy"
resignation:
"""It's jolly hard, all the same, to be knocked out like this. You're so"
"helpless--no dug-outs, no shelters anywhere...."""
"""It's doubly hard when you're married,"" said another. ""I haven't got the"
"wind up about myself at all, but I can't help thinking about my wife...."
"They're going away now, thank the Lord. You never know when they won't"
"be coming back though--that's just the worst of it."""
The noise of the propellers was indeed dying away.
"afterthought, ""that I promised to take for a run in your car, if--"""
"""You'll have time enough after lunch,"" Slyne suggested, and drew the"
noble marquis toward the window.
"""The Marquis of Ingoldsby!"" muttered Captain Dove. ""A run in Slyne's"
"car! And--_Lady Josceline Justice!_"" He dug his knuckles forcibly into"
"his blinking eyes, and, ""I seem to be wide enough awake,"" said he in a"
stage aside as several waiters arrived on the scene.
While they were setting the table Sallie tried to collect her thoughts.
"Slyne had told her nothing till then, but that he had found out who her"
"folk were. And she had come away from the _Olive Branch_ blindly, only a"
little less distrustful of him than of Captain Dove's cruel intentions
"toward her if she had remained on board. Even now, she scarcely dared to"
believe--
In response to a sign from Slyne she took her place at the flower-decked
table. The Marquis of Ingoldsby immediately settled himself at her side;
"he also was obviously a young man who knew what he wanted, and meant to"
"have that at all hazards and, while the others were seating themselves,"
he ogled her killingly.
"Slyne had sat down at her other hand, leaving Mr. Jobling and Captain"
Dove to keep one another company behind the great silver centre-piece
"which adorned the circular table. The marquis, leaning on one elbow, had"
"turned his back on Mr. Jobling, and Slyne turned his on Captain Dove."
"""This is a little bit of all right!"" his lordship remarked to Sallie,"
"with a confidential grin. ""Only--I wish--How is it that we haven't met"
"before, Lady Josephine? But never mind that. Let's be pals now. Shall"
"we, eh?"""
"heat of the water, the pungent smell of the mustard, and that droning hum"
slowly soothed and drowsed away the vehemence of feeling.  She looked at
"her body, silver-white in the yellowish water, with a dreamy sensation."
"Some day she, too, would love! Strange feeling she had never had before!"
"Strange, indeed, that it should come at such a moment, breaking through"
the old instinctive shrinking.  Yes; some day love would come to her.
"There floated before her brain the adoring look on Daphne Wing's face,"
"the shiver that had passed along her arm, and pitifulness crept into her"
"heart--a half-bitter, half-admiring pitifulness.  Why should she"
"grudge--she who did not love?  The sounds, like the humming of large"
"flies, grew deeper, more vibrating.  It was the cook, in her passion"
"swelling out her music on the phrase,"
"""Be it ne-e-ver so humble,"
"There's no-o place like home!"""

"That night, Gyp slept peacefully, as though nothing had happened, as"
though there were no future at all before her.  She woke into misery.
"Her pride would never let her show the world what she had discovered,"
would force her to keep an unmoved face and live an unmoved life.  But
the struggle between mother-instinct and revolt was still going on within
"her.  She was really afraid to see her baby, and she sent word to Betty"
that she thought it would be safer if she kept quite quiet till the
afternoon.
She got up at noon and stole downstairs.  She had not realized how
violent was her struggle over HIS child till she was passing the door of
"“They’re mighty good guns,” he said hesitatingly. “Seems a shame to"
throw ’em away like this.”
Bainbridge returned briefly: “I’m simply pulling the stings of this
gang.”
"He watched his man fling the weapons, one after another, into the"
"stream, and then, sending the automatic splashing after the others, he"
turned suddenly back to the six humiliated individuals before him.
"“Go!” he commanded, with a momentary flare of passion. “Beat it, and"
don’t let me set eyes on you again--understand? I won’t be so easy on
"you the next time. Here, take that scum with you. He’s only stunned.”"
"He waited, staring from under lowered lids, until the gang had"
"disappeared in the bushes, half dragging, half carrying their stunned"
"leader with them. Then, with a long sigh, he turned slowly and smiled at"
Peters.
"“All right, Jack,” he said quietly. “I don’t think we’ll have any more"
trouble here. Just hustle all you can to make up for this delay.”
"Peters grinned, and snapped out some orders to the men which sent them"
flying along the bank and even out on the stream over the tumbling logs.
"But as they went they cast glances of open, unadulterated admiration at"
"the young man coolly brushing a bit of mud from one shoulder, and their"
comments to each other left no trace of doubt of their thorough approval
of everything he had said and done.
"Bob heard some of them, and when the men had gone on he smiled a bit. To"
get that drive down successfully he knew he must have the men with him.
dash.
"""No!"" he exclaimed. ""I'm not a fighting man, but I'm a good general."
"You know, Napoleon was about my size."""
"""I never noticed the resemblance,"" remarked Fraser."
"""All the same, your idea ain't so bad,"" said Balt. ""There's somebody"
"stirring those fellows up, and I think it's that detective. I wouldn't"
"mind getting my hands on him, and if you'll all stick with me I'll go"
"out after him."""
"""Not for mine,"" hastily declared ""Fingerless"" Fraser. ""I don't want to"
"fight anybody. I'm here as a spectator."""
"""You're not afraid?"" questioned Emerson."
"""Not exactly afraid, but what's the use of my getting mixed up in this"
"row? It ain't _my_ cannery."""
"Now, while a mob is by nature noisy and threatening, there is little"
real danger in it until its diffusive violence is directed into one
"channel by a leader. Then, indeed, it becomes a terrible thing, and to"
"the watchers at the dock it became evident, in time, that a guiding"
"influence was at work among their enemies. Sure enough, late in the"
"afternoon of the fourth day, without a moment's warning, the strikers"
"rushed in a body, bearing down the guards like reeds. They came so"
unexpectedly that there was no time to muster reinforcements at the
"gate; almost before the fishermen could drop their tasks, their enemies"
were inside the building and pandemonium had broken loose. The
"structure rocked to the tumult of pounding heels, of yells and"
"imprecations, the lofty roof serving to toss back and magnify the"
"""You speak in enigmas, Yolande.  Why not be more explicit?"""
"Her pale lips trembled, her eyes were brimming with tears, her chilly"
"hand quivered in mine.  She did not speak for some moments, but at last"
"said in a low, tremulous voice half choked by emotion:"
"""Once you loved me, Gerald,--of that I feel confident; and I"
"reciprocated your affection, God knows!  Our love was, perhaps, curious,"
inasmuch as you were English and I was of a different creed and held
different ideas from those which you considered right.  It is always the
same with a man and woman of different nationality--there must be a
"give-and-take principle between them.  Between us, however, there was"
"perfect confidence until, by a strange combination of circumstances--by"
a stroke of the sword of Fate--that incident occurred which led to our
"estrangement."""
"She paused, her blanched lips shut tight.  ""Well?""  I asked, ""I am all"
attention.  Why is it too late now for me to make reparation for the
"past?"""
I loved her with all my soul.  I was heedless of those words of the old
"Baronne, of Anderson's suspicions, and Kaye's denunciation.  Even if she"
"were a spy, I adored her.  The fire of that old love had swept upon me,"
"and I could not hold back, even though her touch might be as that of a"
leper and her lips venomous.
"""Reparation is impossible,"" she answered hoarsely.  ""Is not that"
"sufficient?"""
"""No, it is not sufficient,"" I answered clearly.  ""I will not be put off"
"by such an answer."""
"Lampert, as it breezed up again."
"And five minutes' later, while Lampert was lighting his pipe half-way"
"down the cabin stairs, he heard a bellow forward which made him drop"
thoughts of tobacco.
"""Breakers ahead!"""
The watch came out on deck and ran aft; and were followed by the
"watch below in various articles of attire, not calculated to keep"
them very warm.
The _Potluck_ had been running with the wind nearly dead aft.
"""Starboard, starboard!"" roared Lampert.  ""Oh, steady; hold her there!"""
The vessel ran off to port at a sharp angle to her wake.
"""Up here some,"" yelled the mate, ""and set the spanker!  Stand by"
"the----  My God!"""
"And, as old Jones and Simcox came on deck, the _Potluck_ was hard and"
fast ashore.  With one simultaneous crack the three topmasts went
"over the side, and as the men and officers jumped under the shelter"
"of the weather rail, Lampert and those of the watch who were with him"
came tumbling down from the poop.  They reckoned on a boiling sea
coming after and sweeping them away.  But though the malignity native
"to matter had set the _Potluck_ ashore, by good luck she was hard and"
fast in the one sheltered cove on the island.  When Lampert by
"instinct altered her course to port, as he heard the coast breakers"
"at the starboard bow, he had run her in between two ledges of rock,"
of which the outer or more westerly one acted as a complete
"myself who have no fixed residence, Sallie; and no powerful friends to"
whom to appeal against such infernal injustice. I can't tell you how
"thankful I'll be, on your account as well as my own, when we're married"
"and safely settled down, with a home of our own to feel safe in!"
"""Look, there's where we'll live when we're in London."""
Sallie looked out. They were whirling past one of the most imposing
"houses in Grosvenor Square. ""Is it an hotel?"" she asked, and observed"
that all but one or two of its topmost windows were dark.
"""It's the Earl of Jura's town house,"" said Slyne, apparently somewhat"
"piqued by her seeming indifference. ""It's yours now--or will be as soon"
"as the Chancery Court wakes up again."""
Sallie glanced back and caught another glimpse of it as the taxicab
slowed again to take the corner of the square. Slyne had picked up the
speaking-tube.
"""Get us to the station now, as fast as you can,"" he told the driver: and"
"then, having glanced at his watch, lighted a cigarette. He seemed to"
"have no more to say at the moment, and Sallie was busy with thoughts of"
her own. She was wondering whether Justin Carthew could be living in
that great house. She could not understand.... But she did not dare to
"ask Jasper Slyne for any information, since he had shown her more than"
once already that he did not intend to tell her any more than he thought
fit.
When they finally reached the station they found Mr. Jobling awaiting
them there and very anxious over their late arrival.
"""We drove round by Grosvenor Square,"" Slyne told the lawyer"
"""Hope to goodness you are,"" declared his lordship. ""Stay for a week or"
"two, anyhow: and,""--he lowered his voice to a husky whisper, leaning"
"toward her--""let _me_ trot you about a bit, eh? You'll maybe see more"
"than enough of _him_ by and by!"" He indicated Slyne with an eloquent"
"elbow, and further expressed his sentiments by means of an ardent sigh."
"Beyond the blossom-laden épergne, Mr. Jobling and Captain Dove, almost"
"cut off from other intercourse by that barrier, were exchanging coldly"
"critical glances. Neither seemed to be quite at his ease with the other,"
"and both had, of course, a great many urgent questions to put to Slyne"
as soon as the Marquis of Ingoldsby should be gone. So that the
"luncheon-party must have proved a very dull affair to them, and they"
were no doubt glad when it was over.
"Slyne signalled to Sallie as soon as coffee was served, and she rose to"
leave the room. She was quite accustomed to being promptly dispensed
with whenever her company might have been inconvenient.
"""Oh, I say!"" protested Lord Ingoldsby. ""You're not goin' yet, Lady J."
Half a mo'. Won't you come for a spin with me now that the car's mine?
Just say the word and I'll drop my other engagement. And then we could
"dine at--"""
"""Lady Josceline will be engaged with her lawyer all afternoon,"" Slyne"
"cut him short with the utmost coolness, ""and she's leaving Monte Carlo"
"again to-night."""
The Marquis of Ingoldsby glowered at him.
"""I'll see you in Paris, then, Lady J.,"" he went on, pointedly ignoring"
"Slyne, ""or in London, at least, later on. Well, good-bye--if you must be"
"on French money, told the Abbé that he hoped to see him, with his"
"credentials, at Whitehall on the second morning following at ten o'clock,"
"and the Abbé said he would leave his credentials with my Lord Clarendon,"
"and would be at Whitehall at the hour suggested by the king, for the"
purpose of making the French king's offer.
"Most of the guests went home between two men, very late at night, but"
fortunately I was able to walk home by myself.
I was both glad and disappointed not to find George in the gown of the
Abbé. I was glad because of the risk he would have taken had he come to
"England, yet disappointed in missing what would have been the most"
"picturesque, daring personal exploit of English court history. But on the"
whole it was better as it was.
"The next morning the king sent for me to come to his closet, and asked if"
"I knew one Lilly, an astrologer. I answered that I knew little of him"
"personally, but had heard much of his wisdom and learning."
"""Yes, yes, but you know where he lives, do you not? On the Strand, a"
"dozen houses this side of Temple Bar?"" asked the king."
"""I have seen the house often, your Majesty,"" I replied."
"""Good! Now listen attentively to what I have to say,"" returned the king,"
graciously taking my arm and leading me to a window overlooking the
"river. ""I hear from De Grammont that the Abbé du Boise is a firm believer"
"in the teachings of astrology. I want you to arrange, without letting any"
"one know that my finger is in the pie, to take Lilly to see the Abbé, or"
the Abbé to see Lilly. I'll whisper a word in your ear. The stars will

"and his ambassadors will find their match in me, I warrant you. I have"
"He turned to the landlady. ""What's the address here, sister?"""
"And later, with the landlady back in her lair, Brent Taber sat down on"
the stairs to wait; sat there with surprise at the feeling of relief
that filled his mind. He had no feeling of triumph about it; no sense of
"a job well done. But there was no great guilt at having failed, either."
"Mostly, he thought, it was the simplification that had come about. There"
had been so many confusing and bewildering complications in the affair;
improbability piled on the impossible; the ridiculous coupled with the
incredible.
"But now, with one stroke of a knife, it had been simplified and brought"
into terms everyone could understand; into terms Captain Abrams of the
New York Police Department would grasp in an instant.
A killer was on the loose.

One of Senator Crane's priceless gifts was a sense of timing. Much of
his success had sprung from the instinctive knowledge of when to act. He
"had a sense of the dramatic which never deserted him. As a result, he"
had been known to turn in an instant from one subject to another--to
dodge defeats and score triumphs with bewildering agility.
His preoccupation on this particular day was with a home-state
"issue--the location of a government plant. After he obtained the floor,"
he counted the house and noted that only a bare quorum was present.
"Gradually, the members of the Senate of the United States would drift to"
their seats. So Crane began reading letters which tended to support his

"with passengers?  Oh, get out!"""
"""You've got to take 'em,"" said the agent philosophically; ""maybe"
"they'll teach you something, and it'll be a good advertisement."""
"""Gah'n!"" said Prowse; ""carryin' scientific jossers won't bring better"
freight next season.  I wish you'd get me chock up with cattle.  I
can't stand scientists; my sister married one that was an 'erbalist
in the Old Kent Road--and since he went to chokey I've lost conceit
"with science.  However, if it must be--why, send 'em along!"""
Captain Prowse was not a popular skipper with sailors.  They said
"that he was a ""hard nut"" and a ""sailor-robber,"" and that his American"
experience had made him nearly as deadly as any American captain with
a belaying-pin.  But sailors' experience only works backward: they
"are good at reminiscence only, and the _Nemagosenda_ got a crew in"
spite of the captain's reputation.  It is possible they would not
have shipped if they had known that men of European light and leading
were to come with them.  Those who follow the sea have a great
"respect for knowledge, but they despise men in soft hats and"
spectacles.  And it cannot be denied that scientific men are as a
rule too simple and gentle to look as if they could take care of
"themselves.  According to Jack, that is the first duty of man, though"

"school and partly on the Continent during leave. Dawson, who was"
"evidently very proud of his young pupil and assistant, paraded his"
"accomplishments before us rather to Trehayne's embarrassment. ""Try him"
"with French and German,"" urged Dawson. ""He can chatter them as well as"
English. But he is as close as wax in all three languages. Some men
"can't keep their tongues still in one."""
"I turned to Trehayne and spoke in French: ""German I can't abide, but"
"French I love. My vocabulary is extensive, but my accent"
abominable--incurably British. You can hear it for yourself how it
"gives me away."""
"""It is not quite of Paris,"" replied Trehayne. ""Mais vous parlez"
"francais tres bien, tres correctement. Beaucoup mieux que moi."""
"""Non, non, monsieur,"" I protested, and then reverted to English."
"""Now,"" said Dawson, when Trehayne had left us, ""I must get along, see"
"the Commander of the _Malplaquet_, and draw a uniform and rifle out of"
the marine stores. It will be quite like old times. You won't see me
"until Saturday, when I shall be either a triumphant or a broken man."
"What is the betting, Mr. Copplestone?"""
"I could not understand the quizzical little smile that Dawson gave me,"
nor the humorous twitch of his lips. He had contemptuously disclaimed
"all use of theories, yet there was more moving behind that big"
forehead of his than he chose to give away. Did his ideas run on
parallel lines with mine; did he even suspect that I had formed any
"idea at all? I could not inquire, for I dislike being laughed at,"
"especially by this man Dawson. I had nothing to go upon, at least so"
little that was palpable that anything which I might say would be
"dismissed as the merest guesswork, for which, as Dawson proclaimed, he"
"I manage to reach the trading center at midday, when everyone is up and"
"about, and the post office open. They give me a large sheet of wrapping"
paper and string and sealing wax; I wrap the parcel and seal it and write
on the outside. There!
"Oh--I forgot the slip of paper with the address--to put it inside, I mean."
"Stupid! But otherwise I have done what I should. As I continue on my way,"
I feel strangely void and deserted; no doubt because the knapsack was
"quite heavy after all, and now I am well rid of it. ""The last pleasure!"" I"
"think suddenly. And as I walk on I think irrelevantly: ""The last country,"
"the last island, the last pleasure...."""

What now?
"I didn't know at first. The winter stood before me, my summer behind"
"me--no task, no yearning, no ambition. As it made no difference where I"
"stayed, I remembered a town I knew, and thought I might as well go"
"there--why not? A man cannot forever sit by the sea, and it is not"
necessary to misunderstand him if he decides to leave it. So he leaves
his solitude--others have done so before him--and a mild curiosity drives
him to see the ships and the horses and the tiny frostbitten gardens of a
"certain town. When he arrives there, he begins to wonder in his idleness"
"if he does not know someone in this town, in this terrifyingly large town."
"The moonlight is bright now, and it amuses him to give himself a certain"
"address to visit evening after evening, and to take up his post there as"
"though something depended on it. He is not expected anywhere else, so he"
"shoulder to see what was tickling his fancy so, he frowned and folded"
that document up and returned it to Mr. Jobling.
"""Give it here, now!"" growled Captain Dove, menacing Mr. Jobling with a"
"clenched fist; and the lawyer, after an appealing, impotent glance at"
"Slyne, had no recourse but to comply with that peremptory order."
"""Are you quite sure of your figures?"" Slyne asked, with a scowl. He"
"seemed conscious that he, in his haste, had made a false step. And Mr."
Jobling nodded with nervous assurance.
"""I have inside sources of information as to the revenue of the estates,"""
"he replied, ""and a note of all the investments. I've allowed a wide"
"margin for all sorts of incidentals. I think you'll find, in fact, that"
Lady Josceline's inheritance will amount to even more than I've
"estimated."""
"Slyne smiled again, more contentedly. Nor was his complaisance overcome"
even when Mr. Jobling put to him a half-whispered petition for a
further small cash advance to account of expenses.
"""I wasn't even able to pay Mullins' wages with what you gave me in"
"Paris,"" said the stout solicitor vexedly. ""Fees and so on swallowed it"
"all up, and--I'm actually short of cab-fares!"""
"""Why don't you fire Mullins, then?"" demanded Slyne with a shade of"
"impatience. ""I've just got rid of my chauffeur because he was costing me"
"more than he was worth."""
"""But I can't afford to get rid of Mullins. Just at the moment he's very"
useful to me. It would create a bad impression if I had to run my own
"errands. And--the fact is, he knows far too much. I'll pay him off and"
"""That's hardly fair, is it?"" commented Wilson."
"""It's a start. You have to start somewhere. Radio--know its start?"
The first message was sent across the ocean a few hundred years ago
from one man to the other after they had made a complete plan as to
"time, date, location and frequency, and also the transmitted message."
"Sure enough, they got through. That, too, was under the ideal test"
conditions. So when we finally assembled the half-a-hundred separate
circuits and devices that made it look as though we might have a space
"detector, we put up targets, aimed our equipment, and looked for a"
"response where there should be one."""
"""We don't know where our target is,"" objected Wilson."
"""And we haven't yet fired up this equipment to seek a target of unknown"
"position and range,"" admitted Allison. ""But this gear is better than"
"nothing."""
Again the green spots flickered in the dome over their heads.
"""What do all those spots mean?"" asked Wilson."
"""Those are false targets, probably caused by background noise. Although"
"the infrawave is noiseless, we still seem to be getting it. Dr."
"Friedrich disagrees. He claims this is not noise, but interferences."
"However, the good doctor is not at all certain that the so-called"
interferences come from localized conditions within the equipment or
"from external sources."""
"Wilson shrugged. ""I don't see how it's done with a radiation type that"
"has neither a directional quality nor a velocity of propagation."""
"So we remained till, at last, about two a.m., I caught sight of a"
"light on a small hill not very far away in the west, and, on going"
"over to it, found a sort of recluse, or holy man, quietly cooking his"
food. After the usual courtesies I asked him to come and help me to
pull my car out. He replied that he was an old man and could not do
"much by himself, but that a caravan of nomads, who had arrived the"
"evening before, were encamped close by. So off I went again, flushed"
"my ""quarry"", and, with the help of large bribes, persuaded all the"
able-bodied men to come back to the car. Fortunately we carried a
"good strong rope as part of our kit, so soon had the car out and"
running again.
Allan was never again ordered to drive through water on that route.
[Illustration: IN DIFFICULTIES BETWEEN NASARATABAD AND ROBAT.]
"On the second day our troubles recommenced, for we had barely done"
"a dozen miles than we stuck in another sand-hill, and the laborious"
"digging-out process had to be done all over again. Fortunately, the"
party who had got the car out of the lake the night before were close
"behind, and for an obvious reason. They had been given so many rupees"
"for their timely help that, knowing the difficulties lying ahead,"
they had followed in the hope of further largesse. They got it.
"Once safely out again I made a tour of inspection round the car, but"
only to find more trouble.
"""Hullo, what on earth is this, Allan? She's leaking!"""
"Allan smiled a superior smile. ""I don't think so, sir. My cars don't"
"leak."""
"The time was barely 10 o’clock at night, but chilly gusts of wind with"
a taste of rain in them had well nigh de-peopled the streets.
"Trying doors as he went, twirling his club with many intricate and"
"artful movements, turning now and then to cast his watchful eye adown"
"the pacific thoroughfare, the officer, with his stalwart form and"
"slight swagger, made a fine picture of a guardian of the peace. The"
vicinity was one that kept early hours. Now and then you might see the
lights of a cigar store or of an all-night lunch counter; but the
majority of the doors belonged to business places that had long since
been closed.
When about midway of a certain block the policeman suddenly slowed his
"walk. In the doorway of a darkened hardware store a man leaned, with an"
unlighted cigar in his mouth. As the policeman walked up to him the man
spoke up quickly.
"“It’s all right, officer,” he said, reassuringly. “I’m just waiting for"
a friend. It’s an appointment made twenty years ago. Sounds a little
"funny to you, doesn’t it? Well, I’ll explain if you’d like to make"
certain it’s all straight. About that long ago there used to be a
restaurant where this store stands—‘Big Joe’ Brady’s restaurant.”
"“Until five years ago,” said the policeman. “It was torn down then.”"
The man in the doorway struck a match and lit his cigar. The light
"showed a pale, square-jawed face with keen eyes, and a little white"
"scar near his right eyebrow. His scarfpin was a large diamond, oddly"
set.
"“Twenty years ago to-night,” said the man, “I dined here at ‘Big Joe’"
"Brady’s with Jimmy Wells, my best chum, and the finest chap in the"
"and their superstition. If I get in the first shot, they will bolt. If"
"_he_ does--"""
"""You are going to shoot him down like a rat in a trap!"" Beatrice burst"
out passionately.
The others had already hurried on. With a gentle force he urged her to
follow them.
"""Or be shot down myself,"" he said. ""Leave me to do my duty as I think"
"best."""
"She met his grave eyes defiantly, but perhaps some instinct told her"
"that he was risking his life for a poor chance--for their last chance,"
"for without a word she turned away, apparently in the direction which"
her companions had already taken.
"As soon as she was out of sight, Nicholson recharged his smoking"
"revolver, and stood there quietly waiting. His trained ear heard the"
firing in front of the bungalow cease. He knew then that his men were
"retiring to join Colonel Carmichael, and that he stood alone, the last"
barrier between death and those he loved. The sound of triumphant
shouting drew nearer; he heard the wrenching and tearing of doors
"crashing down before an impetuous onslaught, the cling of steel, a"
howl of sudden satisfaction. His hand tightened upon his revolver; he
"stood ready to meet his enemy single-handed, to fight out the duel"
between man and man. But no one came. A bewildering silence had
followed upon the last bloodthirsty cry. It was as though the hand of
death had fallen and with one annihilating blow beaten down the
approaching horde in the high tide of their victory. But of the two
this strange stillness was the more terrible. It penetrated to the
little waiting group in the old bungalow and filled them with the
Is _Alice in Wonderland?_  Is _Treasure Island?_  These are
"masterpieces which we read with pleasure as children, but with how"
much more pleasure when we are grown-up.  In any case what do we mean
"by ""children""?  A boy of three, a girl of six, a boy of ten, a girl of"
fourteen--are they all to like the same thing?  And is a book
"""suitable for a boy of twelve"" any more likely to please a boy of"
twelve than a modern novel is likely to please a man of thirty-seven;
"even if the novel be described truly as ""suitable for a man of"
"thirty-seven""?  I confess that I cannot grapple with these difficult"
problems.
But I am very sure of this: that no one can write a book which
"children will like, unless he write it for himself first.  That being"
"so, I shall say boldly that this is a story for grown-ups.  How"
grown-up I did not realise until I received a letter from an unknown
reader a few weeks after its first publication; a letter which said
"that he was delighted with my clever satires of the Kaiser, Mr. Lloyd"
"George and Mr. Asquith, but he could not be sure which of the"
characters were meant to be Mr. Winston Churchill and Mr. Bonar Law.
Would I tell him on the enclosed postcard?  I replied that they were
thinly disguised on the title-page as Messrs. Hodder & Stoughton.  In
"fact, it is not that sort of book."
"But, as you see, I am still finding it difficult to explain just what"
sort of book it is.  Perhaps no explanation is necessary.  Read in it
what you like; read it to whomever you like; be of what age you like;
"it can only fall into one of two classes.  Either you will enjoy it,"
or you won't.
It is that sort of book.

"kidnapping----"""
Gatepath looked around anxiously. The men were alone in a recess of the
"club smoking-room. ""Yes,"" he whispered eagerly. ""Yes, go on."""
"""I shall not do anything of the sort. You are a nice sort of family"
"solicitor, Gatepath. Apart from the personal danger of playing tricks,"
"can't you see that your interest lies with the bouncing heir, not with"
"the snuffy old family? Don't be an ass. Bring him home, give the House"
"of Lords the sensation of their placid lives, and let the good old"
British public enjoy a week of laughter. How they will bellow with joy.
"And the newspapers! I can see, Gatepath, that your agreeable young heir"
"is going to be the Success of the Season."""
"""You are not very helpful,"" groaned Gatepath. ""There must be a"
solution; there must be some way of shielding the Family from this
"frightful humiliation."""
"The interview with the Chief was a complete failure, and Gatepath parted"
from his old friend both hurt and angry. He had not expected ribald
"laughter in so grave a social crisis. The Chief must be a Radical, a"
"Socialist, even a Bolshevik, one empty of all decent political"
principles.
It was on his way home that Gatepath bethought him of Madame Gilbert.
"She, that beautiful, loyal-hearted woman, would not laugh. He remembered"
the glitter of unshed tears in the violet eyes when she had bade him
farewell. It was his tactless hand upon the open wound of Caporetto
"which had aroused those tears. He remembered also that Madame was free,"
"and that she had been trained to do the ruthless, unscrupulous work of"
"the Secret Service. She did not look either ruthless or unscrupulous,"
and it was in a strictly professional sense that Gatepath connected her
well if you would summon all the servants of the palace together and arm
"them with such weapons as may be available!"""
"Maria Cristina lifted her head from the shoulder of her Ferdinand, as if"
"she did not at first comprehend Rollo's speech, and was resolved to"
resent an intrusion at such a moment. Whereupon the Scot repeated his
words to such good purpose that the Queen-Regent threw up her hands and
"cried, ""Alas! this happens most unfortunately. We have only old Eugenio"
and a couple of lads in the whole palace since the departure of the
"guards!"""
"""Never mind,"" said Rollo; ""let us make the best of the matter. We will"
muster them; perhaps they will be able to load and fire a musket apiece!
"If I mistake not, the fighting will be at very short range!"""
It was upon this occasion that Señor Fernando Muñoz showed his first
spark of interest.
"""I will go and awake them,"" he said; ""I know where the servants are wont"
"to sleep."""
But on this occasion his fond wife would not permit him to stir.
"""The wicked murderers may have already penetrated to that part of the"
"castle,"" she palpitated, her arms still about his neck, ""and you must"
"not risk your precious life. Let Susana go and fetch them. She is old,"
"and has doubtless made her peace with religion."""
"""Nay, it is not fitting,"" objected Susana with spirit. ""I am a woman,"
and not so old as my lady says. I cannot go gadding about into the
"chambers of all and sundry. Besides, there has been purpose of marriage"
openly declared between me and the Señor Eugenio for upwards of thirty
"Almost unconsciously Rollo put it to his lips. It was a cold morning,"
and it is small wonder that his hand shook a little. He was just
"twenty-three, and his main regret was that he had not kissed little"
"Concha Cabezos--with her will, or against it--all would have been one"
now. Meantime he looked about him for a light. The general noticed his
"hesitation, rose from the table, and with a low bow offered his own, as"
one gentleman to another. Rollo thanked him. The two men approached as
"if to embrace. Each drew a puff of his cigarette, till the points glowed"
"red. Rollo, retreating a little, swept a proud acknowledgment of thanks"
with his _sombrero_. Cabrera bowed with his hand on his heart. The young
"Scot clicked his heels together as if on parade, and strode out with"
head erect and squared shoulders in the rear of his companions.
"""By God's bread, a man!"" said Cabrera, as he resumed his writing, ""'tis"
"a thousand pities I must shoot him!"""
"They stood all four of them in the garden of the mill-house, underneath"
the fig trees in whose shade El Sarria had once hidden himself to watch
the midnight operations of Don Tomas.
"The sun was just rising. His beams red, low, and level shot across the"
"mill-wheel, turning the water of the unused overshot into a myriad"
pearls and diamonds as it splashed through a side culvert into the
"gorge beneath, in which the gloom of night lingered."
"The four men still stood in order. Mortimer and Etienne in the middle,"
with slim Rollo and the giant Ramon towering on either flank.
"""_Load with ball--at six paces--make ready!_"""
"The officer's commands rang out with a certain haste, for he could"
"the hospitality of the Nat by hunting near his home, came to severe"
grief.
"But the Nat has gone now, alas! The tree is still there, but the Nat has"
fled away these many years.
"'I suppose he didn't care to stay,' said the headman. 'You see that the"
"English Government officials came and camped here, and didn't fear the"
"Nats. They had fowls killed here for their dinner, and they sang and"
"shouted; and they shot the green pigeons who ate his figs, and the"
little doves that nested in his branches.'
"All these things were an abomination to the Nat, who hated loud, rough"
"talk and abuse, and to whom all life was sacred."
"So the Nat went away. The headman did not know where he was gone, but"
there are plenty of trees.
"'He has gone somewhere to get peace,' the headman said. 'Somewhere in"
"the jungle, where no one ever comes save the herd-boy and the deer, he"
"will be living in a tree, though I do not think he will easily find a"
tree so beautiful as this.'
"The headman seemed very sorry about it, and so did several villagers who"
"were with him; and I suggested that if the Nat-houses were rebuilt, and"
"flowers and water offered, the Nat might know and return. I even offered"
"to contribute myself, that it might be taken as an _amende honorable_ on"
behalf of the English Government. But they did not think this would be
"any use. No Nat would come where there was so much going and coming, so"
"little care for life, such a disregard for pity and for peace. If we"
"were to take away our rest-house, well then, perhaps, after a time,"
"something could be done, but not under present circumstances."

"Dex shuddered; and a low moan came from Greca, whose clear blue eyes"
had rested on the contents of this vast room before in her capacity as
hostage and interpreter for the inhuman Rogans.
And now another sense of Dex's began to register perception on his
brain.
"A peculiar odor came to his nostrils. It was a musky, fetid odor, like"
"that to be smelled in an animal cage; but it was sharper, more acrid"
"than anything he had ever smelled on Earth. It smelled--ah, he had"
it!--_reptilian_. As though somewhere nearby a dozen titanic serpents
were coiled ready to spring!
"Looking about, Dex saw a six-foot square door of bars in one wall of"
"They travelled next day, reaching London at half-past two.  Betty had"
gone up in the early morning to prepare the way.  The dogs had been with
Aunt Rosamund all this time.  Gyp missed their greeting; but the
installation of Betty and the baby in the spare room that was now to be
"the nursery, absorbed all her first energies.  Light was just beginning"
"to fail when, still in her fur, she took a key of the music-room and"
"crossed the garden, to see how all had fared during her ten weeks'"
"absence.  What a wintry garden!  How different from that languorous,"
"warm, moonlit night when Daphne Wing had come dancing out of the shadow"
"of the dark trees.  How bare and sharp the boughs against the grey,"
"darkening sky--and not a song of any bird, not a flower!  She glanced"
"back at the house. Cold and white it looked, but there were lights in her"
"room and in the nursery, and someone just drawing the curtains.  Now that"
"the leaves were off, one could see the other houses of the road, each"
"different in shape and colour, as is the habit of London houses. It was"
"old, old babies inside. She holds up a lace parasol; he sucks the knob"
"of his cane, and the fat old bodies roll together as the cradle rocks,"
and the steaming horse leaves a trail of manure as it ambles down the
hill.
"Under a tree, Professor Leonard, in cap and gown, stands beside his"
"banner. He is here “for one day,” from the London, Paris and Brussels"
"Exhibition, to tell your fortune from your face. And he stands, smiling"
"encouragement, like a clumsy dentist. When the big men, romping and"
"swearing a moment before, hand across their sixpence, and stand before"
"him, they are suddenly serious, dumb, timid, almost blushing as the"
Professor’s quick hand notches the printed card. They are like little
"children caught playing in a forbidden garden by the owner, stepping"
from behind a tree.
The top of the hill is reached. How hot it is! How fine it is! The
"public-house is open, and the crowd presses in. The mother sits on the"
"pavement edge with her baby, and the father brings her out a glass of"
"dark, brownish stuff, and then savagely elbows his way in again. A reek"
"of beer floats from the public-house, and a loud clatter and rattle of"
voices.
"The wind has dropped, and the sun burns more fiercely than ever."
Outside the two swing-doors there is a thick mass of children like
flies at the mouth of a sweet-jar.
"And up, up the hill come the people, with ticklers and golliwogs, and"
"roses and feathers. Up, up they thrust into the light and heat,"
"shouting, laughing, squealing, as though they were being pushed by"
"something, far below, and by the sun, far ahead of them—drawn up into"
"the full, bright, dazzling radiance to... what?"
with just the right inflection of sarcasm to sting. It had suddenly
occurred to him that the fellow’s object was to make him lose his
"temper, and thus precipitate a clash, during which almost anything might"
"be accomplished. Not only did he refuse to let go his grip, but he did"
"his very best to goad Joyce himself into flaming out, and possibly"
betraying a few secrets.
"“That’s hardly the question, though,” he went on swiftly. “Strikes me"
you’ve been rather premature in running out the boom. Your mill isn’t
"operating, and I have yet to see a single log coming downstream except"
our own.”
"“Never you mind that,” retorted Joyce hotly. “Do you think a man’s going"
to wait till his timber comes in sight afore makin’ arrangements to take
care of it? You can’t come over me with no soft talk like that. The
"boom’s there, an’ there it stays. Half the river’s clear for you to use,"
an’ that’s all you gets.”
"“Hum! That’s your last word, is it?” inquired Bainbridge quietly. “You"
even refuse to let us swing the boom around so we can break our jam?”
“I do!” replied the red-haired individual emphatically. “The first man
"that tries to monkey with my property will wish he hadn’t, that’s all I"
got to say.”
"He raised his automatic significantly, but Bob was not even looking at"
"him. The young man’s gaze had swept out to the face of the jam, and in"
an incredibly short space an accurate picture of its appearance had been
photographed on his brain. Still without giving Joyce the satisfaction
"of a glance, he turned away, motioning Peters to accompany him."
"“A put-up job, of course,” he said tersely, when they were through the"
"ordering, but that they shall not. On every breach of her vigorous laws"
Nature waits with weaponed hand. At the elbow of every vice stands
foul-breathed disease.
There is no sin in the love of man and woman. The woman has committed
no sin in loving--she has but accepted the overwhelming urging of life.
It is her chiefest glory. Man has committed no sin in loving; his life
has ordered it; and the Masterfolk obey life. It is his chiefest glory.
Who so glum a dullard but smiles to see lovers meeting! But he sins
"foully who is guilty of the repudiation--foully against the woman,"
"criminally against his race, blasphemously against his godhood, and"
damnably against his manhood. Such are not of the Masterfolk.
"They of the inferior manhood, lacking in the force of character"
necessary to the full acceptance of the duties of the Masterfolk in
"love, have not the virile force to abide by a woman of the Masterfolk;"
and these come out when the lamps are lit and there are shadows in the
"land, and skulk about the by-lanes, and commit mean adulteries with"
"frail women, and have the habit of repudiating debt. Such cannot breed"
the Masterfolk. They shall not. For these cower from the strengthening
risks that dog a strenuous life; they would have the delight of
marriage without the courage....”
Noll opened the window.
There came from the street below the hoarse cry of a prostitute.
"He went into the room, lit a candle, and sat down at his desk."
Everything in the place whispered of Betty this night.
He wrote a letter:
"""Please don't make scenes in the street, and don't follow me like this."
"If you want to talk to me, you can--at home."""
"Then, very calmly, she turned and walked on.  But he was still following"
"her, some paces off.  She did not quicken her steps, and to the first"
"taxicab driver that passed she made a sign, and saying:"
"""Bury Street--quick!"" got in.  She saw Fiorsen rush forward, too late to"
"stop her.  He threw up his hand and stood still, his face deadly white"
under his broad-brimmed hat.  She was far too angry and upset to care.
"From the moment she turned to the window at Monsieur Harmost's, she had"
determined to go to her father's.  She would not go back to Fiorsen; and
the one thought that filled her mind was how to get Betty and her baby.
"Nearly four!  Dad was almost sure to be at his club.  And leaning out,"
"she said: ""No; Hyde Park Corner, please."""
"The hall porter, who knew her, after calling to a page-boy: ""Major"
"Winton--sharp, now!"" came specially out of his box to offer her a seat"
and The Times.
"Gyp sat with it on her knee, vaguely taking in her surroundings--a thin"
"old gentleman anxiously weighing himself in a corner, a white-calved"
footman crossing with a tea-tray; a number of hats on pegs; the
"green-baize board with its white rows of tapelike paper, and three"
"members standing before it.  One of them, a tall, stout,"
"good-humoured-looking man in pince-nez and a white waistcoat, becoming"
"conscious, removed his straw hat and took up a position whence, without"
"staring, he could gaze at her; and Gyp knew, without ever seeming to"
"glance at him, that he found her to his liking.  She saw her father's"
"unhurried figure passing that little group, all of whom were conscious"
"now, and eager to get away out of this sanctum of masculinity, she met"
"autumn use, but he keeps putting it off, and probably it will not be done"
"at all. So far it hasn't mattered, but this morning's first wet snow has"
covered the hay outdoors and the maltreated land. And so it will remain
"till next spring. Poor Paul! He is an easygoing man at heart, but he"
"pushes doggedly on against a whirlwind; sometimes he smiles to himself,"
knowing how useless it is to struggle--a distorted smile.
"His father, the old man alone in his room, stands sometimes on his"
"threshold, as he used to do, and reflects. He is lost in memories, for he"
has ninety years behind him. The many houses on the farm confuse him a
"little; the roofs are all too big for him, and he is afraid they might"
come down and carry him off. Once he asked Josephine if it was right that
his hands and fingers should run away from him every day across the
"fields. So they put mittens on his hands, but he took to chewing them; in"
"fact he ate everything he was given, and enjoyed a good digestion. So they"
"must be thankful he had his health, Josephine said, and could be up and"
about.
*       *       *       *       *
"I did not follow the others across the field, but returned the way I had"
"come last spring, down toward the woods and the sea. It is fitting that I"
"should go back, always back, never forward again."
"I passed the hut where Solem and I had lived together, and then the"
"Lapps--the two old people and Olga, this strange cross between a human"
"being and a dwarf birch. A stove stood against the peat wall, and a"
paraffin lamp hung from the roof of their stone-age dwelling. Olga was
"kind and helpful, but she looked tiny and pathetic, like a ruffled hen; it"
"pained me to watch her flit about the room, tiny and crooked, as she"
looked for a pair of reindeer cheeses for me.
Then he saw a gleam of blue metal in Fraser's hands.
"""Give me that gun!"" he panted, but his deliverer held him off."
"""I may need it myself, and I ain't got but the one here! Let's get"
"Clyde out of this."""
"Stepping over the motionless form at his feet, Fraser lifted the young"
"club-man, who was huddled in a formless heap as if he had fallen from a"
"great height, and together the two dragged him toward _The Bedford"
"Castle_. As they went aboard, they were nearly run down by a body of"
reinforcements that Captain Peasley had finally mustered from between
"decks. Down the gang-plank and over the side they poured, grimy"
"stokers, greasy oilers, and swearing deckhands, equipped with"
"capstan-bars, wrenches, and marlin-spikes. Without waiting to observe"
"the effect of these new-comers, Boyd and Fraser bundled Alton into the"
"first cabin at hand, then turned back."
"""Better stay here and look after him. You're all in, yourself,"" the"
"adventurer advised. ""I'm going to hunt up George."""
"He was away on the instant, with Boyd staggering after him, still weak"
"and shaking, the vague discomfort of running blood at the back of his"
"neck, muttering thickly as he went: ""Give me your gun, Fraser! Give me"
"your gun!"""
"The battle was still raging when the police arrived, after an"
"interminable delay, and it ceased only at the rough play of"
"night-sticks, and after repeated charges of the uniformed men had"
"broken up the ranks of the strikers. The dock was cleared at length,"
"and wagon-loads of bleeding, struggling combatants rolled away to jail,"
union and non-union men bundled in together. But work was not resumed
"business puzzles me, though you and your friends here seem to find it"
"devilish amusing. When I told the Chief Constable, the manager of the"
"shipyard, and the Admiral Superintendent of Naval Work that you were"
"the guilty party, they all roared. For some reason the Admiral and the"
shipyard manager kept winking at one another and gurgling till I
"thought they would have choked. What _is_ the joke?"""
"""If you are good, Dawson, I will tell you some day. This is November,"
and the _Rampagious_--the ship described on your paper--left for
"Portsmouth in August. In July--"" I broke off hurriedly, lest I should"
"tell my visitor too much. ""It has taken our friend who put the paper"
in the sardine tin three months to find out details of her. I could
"have done better than that, Dawson."""
"""That is just what the Admiral said, though he wouldn't explain why."""
"""The truth is, Dawson, that the Admiral and I both come from Devon,"
"the land of pirates, smugglers, and buccaneers. We are law breakers by"
instinct and family tradition. When we get an officer of the law on
"toast, we like to make the most of him. It is a playful little way of"
"ours which I am sure you will understand and pardon."""
"""You know, of course, that I am justified in arresting you. I have a"
"warrant and handcuffs in my pocket."""
"""Admirable man!"" I cried, with enthusiasm. ""You are, Dawson, the"
perfect detective. As a criminal I should be mightily afraid of you.
"But, as in my buttonhole I always wear the white flower which"
"proclaims to the world my blameless life, I am thoroughly enjoying"
this visit and our cosy chat beside the fire. Shall I telephone to my
office and say that I shall be unavoidably detained from duty for an
indefinite time? 'Detained' would be the strict truth and the _mot
"for you!"""
"Whereupon, though the connection of idea is not obvious, Rollo"
remembered the moment when he had faced the black muzzles of Cabrera's
"muskets in the chill of the morning, and the bitter regret which had"
"then arisen to his mind. Out there in the dark of the palace-garden,"
death fronted him as really though not perhaps so immediately. He
"resolved quickly that he should not have the same regret again, if the"
worst came to the worst. There was no one in the alcove where Concha had
"found him. The Queen-Regent had disappeared to her suite of rooms, and"
thither after a time Señor Muñoz had followed her. The rest were at that
moment being placed in their various posts by the Sergeant according to
Rollo's directions.
So he stooped quickly and kissed Concha upon the mouth.
It was strange. The girl's inevitable instinct on such matters seemed to
have deserted her. In a somewhat wide experience Concha could always
"tell to a second when an attempt of this kind was due. Most women can,"
"and if they are kissed it is because they want to be. (In which, sayeth"
"the Wise Man, is great wisdom!) A fire-alarm rings in their brain with"
"absolute certainty, giving them time to evite the conflagration by a"
healthy douche of cold water. But Rollo the Firebrand again proved
himself the Masterly Incalculable. Or else--but who could suspect
Concha?
"It is, again sayeth the Wise Man, the same with kicking a dog. The brute"
sees the kick coming before a muscle is in motion. He watches the eye of
his opponent and is forearmed. He vanisheth into space. But when Rollo
"interviewed an animal in this fashion, he kicked first and thought"
"afterwards. Hence no sign of his intention appeared in his eye, and the"
dog's yelp arrived almost as a surprise to himself.
"ravine. It was decided, too, that there was not a moment to be lost in"
"putting their plan into execution. In consequence, Castro immediately"
took his departure.
The hour that passed before the time set for Johnson to leave the cabin
"was a most trying one for both of them. It was not so hard on the man,"
"of course, for he was excited over the prospect of escaping; but the"
"Girl, whose mind was filled with the dread of what might happen to him,"
"had nothing to sustain her. Despite his objection, she had stipulated"
"that, with Jackrabbit as a companion, she should accompany him to the"
"outskirts of the camp. And so, at the moment of departure, throwing"
"about her a cloak of some rough material, she went up to her lover and"
said with a quiver in her voice:
"""I'm ready, Dick, but I'm a-figurin' that I can't let you go alone--you"
"jest got to take me below with you, an' that's all there is to it."""
The man shook his head.
"""There's very little risk, believe me. I'll join Castro and ride all"
through the night. I'll be down below in no time at all. But we must be
"going, dear."""
The man passed through the door first. But when it came the Girl's turn
"she hesitated, for she had seen a dark shadow flit by the window. It was"
"as if someone had been stealthily watching there. In another moment,"
"however, it turned out to be Jackrabbit and, greatly relieved, the Girl"
whispered to Johnson that he was to descend the trail between the Indian
"and herself, and that on no account was he to utter a word until she"
gave him permission.
"For another moment or so they stood in silence; Johnson, appreciating"
"seize them in my strong arms, I will bear them harmless through the"
falling rafters and the blazing beams.’ Then the sad thought came
to him that the children were romping and ignorant. ‘If I say the
"house is on fire, they will not understand me. If I try to seize"
"them, they will romp about and try to escape. Alas! not a moment to"
be lost!’ Suddenly a bright thought flashed across the old man's
"mind. ‘My children are ignorant,’ he said; ‘they love toys and"
glittering playthings. I will promise them playthings of unheard-of
beauty. Then they will listen.’
"So the old man shouted: ‘Children, come out of the house and see"
"these beautiful toys! Chariots with white oxen, all gold and"
tinsel. See these exquisite little antelopes. Whoever saw such
"goats as these? Children, children, come quickly, or they will all"
be gone!’
Forth from the blazing ruin the children came in hot haste. The
word ‘plaything’ was almost the only word they could understand.
"Then the Father, rejoiced that his offspring was freed from peril,"
procured for them one of the most beautiful chariots ever seen:
the chariot had a canopy like a pagoda: it had tiny rails and
balustrades and rows of jingling bells. Milk-white oxen drew the
chariot. The children were astonished when they were placed inside.”
(_From the “Thabagata.”_)
"Perhaps, as a compromise, one might give the gentler superstitions to"
"very small children, and leave such a blood-curdling story as Bluebeard"
to a more robust age.
There is one modern method which has always seemed to me much to be
"condemned, and that is the habit of changing the end of a story, for"
"And, if I do give you another, you needn't suppose--"""
"""Come on inside,"" begged Captain Dove, shivering, in no case to listen"
"to any lecture. ""Come on, and we'll talk sense. Don't waste any more"
"good time."""
"Slyne followed him in again, congratulating himself on his firmness. He"
"felt that he had gained the whip-hand of the old man, and he meant to"
keep it. He curtly refused again Captain Dove's more hospitable offer of
"some refreshment, and, while his aggrieved host was clumsily getting"
"into some warmer clothing, talked to him from the saloon through the"
open doorway of his cramped sleeping-quarters. It was easier to arrange
matters so than under Captain Dove's direct observation.
"""You'll pay me cash, of course,"" Captain Dove stipulated, as though he"
had been bargaining about a charter-party.
"""I'll pay you cash,"" Slyne agreed, ""the day Sallie marries me. And"
"meantime I'll give you my note of hand at thirty days for the money."" He"
"listened intently, but Captain Dove, struggling fretfully with"
"refractory buttons, maintained an ominous silence."
"""I'll have it backed by a London lawyer, to keep you safe,"" said Slyne."
"""And listen! I'm not asking you to risk anything, or even to take my"
note at its face value. I want you to come ashore with me and find out
for yourself from my lawyer that you can depend on the money. If you
"don't feel satisfied about that after you've seen him, you needn't go"
"any farther, we'll call the bargain off; you can get back on board your"
ship at once and no harm done.
"""And, even as regards Sallie, I'm going out of my way to keep you right."
"I'd give a great deal to get married at once, but--I'm willing to wait"
"“Ah, yes, to be sure. Poor little Unity! You must bring her to see me"
"sometimes. Give me notice, and I 'll make her some of my cream-puffs."
Children are always so fond of them. _You_ ought to remember my
cream-puffs.”
"“Good heavens!” he cried, with a gesture that set the dog barking."
“There 's no question of cream-puffs. Can't you see what I'm driving at?
I want you to come and keep house for me and help me to look after the
child.”
"He rose, and his great form towered so threateningly over her that Dandy"
barked at him with a toy terrier's furious and impotent rage.
“I come and live with you?” gasped Miss Lindon.
[Illustration: 0094]
"“Yes,” said John, turning away and lumbering back to the fireplace. The"
"dog, perceiving that he had struck terror into the heart of his enemy,"
"dismissed him with a scornful snarl, and curled himself up by the side"
of his stupefied mistress.
"It was done; the proposal had been made, according to the demands of his"
"pig-headedness. Now that he had made it, he realized its insanity. He"
contrasted this home of flim-flammeries and its lap-dogs and canaries
and old-maidish futilities with his own tobacco-saturated and
paper-littered den; this life of trivialities with his own fighting
career; this incapacity to grasp essentials with his own realization of
the conflict of world-forces. The ludicrous incongruity of a partnership
between the two of them in so fateful a business as the healing of a
human soul appealed to his somewhat dull sense of humour. The whole idea
was preposterous. In his saturnine way he laughed.
"valuables, slung them somehow on her left arm, while with her other"
she piloted the nearly swooning Mrs. Warren into the court.
They were at once stopped by a non-commissioned officer who asked
"them in abrupt, scarcely understandable German what they wanted."
Vivie guessing his meaning said in English--she scarcely knew any
"German: ""This is our house. We have been absent in Brussels. We want"
"to see the officer in command."" The soldier knew no English, but"
likewise guessed at their meaning. He ordered them to wait where
they were. Presently he came out of the Villa and said the Herr
Oberst would see them. Vivie led her mother into the gay little
hall--how pleasant and cool it had looked in the early morning! It
was now full of surly-looking soldiers. Without hesitating she took
"a chair from one soldier and placed her mother in it. ""You rest"
"there a moment, dearest, while I go in and see the officer in"
"command."" The corporal she had first spoken with beckoned her into"
the pretty sitting-room at the back where they had had their early
breakfast that morning.
Here she saw seated at a table consulting plans of Brussels and
"other papers a tall, handsome man of early middle age, who might"
"indeed have passed for a young man, had he not looked very tired and"
"care-worn and exhibited a bald patch at the back of his head,"
rendered the more apparent because the brown-gold curls round it
"were dank with perspiration. He rose to his feet, clicked his heels"
"together and saluted. ""An English young lady, I am told, rather ..."
"a ... surprise ... on ... the ... outskirts ... of Brussels..."" (His"
"English was excellent, if rather staccato and spaced.) ""It ... is"
... not ... usual ... for ... Englishwomen ... to ... be owners ...
of chateaux ... in Belgium. But I ... hear ... it ... is ... your
"mother ... who is the owner ... from long time, and you are her"
daughter newly arrived from England? Nicht wahr? Sie verstehen nicht
"of hesitation.  ""When we were lovers in the old days I was, as you know,"
"a pure, honest, upright woman, with thoughts only for my God and for"
"yourself.  But I am that no longer.  I am unworthy your love, Gerald.  I"
"am unfit to be your wife, and can never be--never!"" and she threw"
"herself upon the couch near by and burst into a flood of tears, while I"
stood there rigid as a statue.
CHAPTER ELEVEN.
DEANE SPEAKS HIS MIND.
An hour later I was seated in my room at the Embassy staring blankly at
"the blotting-pad before me, utterly perplexed and bewildered.  I loved"
"Yolande--nay, she was my idol; nevertheless she had firmly refused to"
allow me to resume my place at her side.  At one moment it seemed to me
as though she had actually made a sacrifice for my sake; yet at another
I could not help regarding both her and her mother with distinct
suspicion.  My love's strange words were in themselves a sufficient
self-condemnation.  Her service as a political agent had been secured by
"one or other of the Powers--France, I suspected; and, to put it plainly,"
she was a spy!
This knowledge had come upon me like a thunderbolt.  Of all the women I
had known and least suspected of endeavouring to learn the secrets of
"our diplomacy, Yolande was certainly the chief.  The events which had"
culminated in her accepting this odious office were veiled in mystery.
Why had she done this?  Who had tempted her or forced her to it?
"Those tears of hers, when she had made confession, were the tears of a"
"woman in the depths of despair and degradation, and I, loving her so"
"fondly, could not but allow my heart to go forth in sympathy.  There was"
an affinity between us that I knew might some day prove fatal.
"covered with fairy-like toilet-articles, its blue delft bowls full of"
"flowers, its atmosphere so dearly English, yet English of the days when"
Sir Bedivere threw Excalibur into the mere. In no other spot on the
"globe could be found such a sea-chamber, with its high bed, on which lay"
"the sweet, elfin face, half child's, half woman's, framed in the soft,"
brown hair.
"Risca smoked on, and Stellamaris, seeing him disinclined to talk, gazed"
"happily out to her beloved Channel, and dreamed her dreams. They had"
"often sat like this for an hour together, both feeling that they were"
talking to each other all the time; and often Stella would break the
"silence by telling him to listen. At such times, so people said,"
"an angel was passing. And he would listen, but could not hear. He"
"remembered Walter Herold once agreeing with her, and saying:"
“There's a special little angel told off to come here every day and
beat his wings about the room so as to clear the air of all troubling
things.”
"In no other spot on the globe could be found such a sea-chamber,"
"wing-swept, spirit-haunted, where pain ceased magically and the burden"
of intolerable suffering grew light. No other haven along all the coasts
of the earth was a haven of rest such as this.
And the Furies were driving him from it! But here the Furies ceased from
driving. Here he had delicious ease. Here a pair of ridiculously frail
hands held him a lotus-fed prisoner. He smoked on. At last he resisted
"the spell. The whole thing was nonsensical. His pipe, only lightly"
"packed by the frail hands, went out. He stuffed it in his pocket, and"
cleared his throat. He would say then and there what he had come to say.
"Stellamaris turned her head and laughed; and when Stellamaris laughed,"
the Kalè Valley. There the buffaloes are turned out into the jungle for
"eight months in the year, and are only caught for ploughing and carting."
"Naturally they are quite wild; in fact, many of them are the offspring"
of wild bulls.
"The Burmans, too, are very fond of dogs. Their villages are full of"
"dogs; but, as far as I know, they never use them for anything, and they"
are never trained to do anything. They are supposed to be useful as
"watch-dogs, but I do not think they are very good even at that. I have"
"surrounded a village before dawn, and never a dog barked, and I have"
heard them bark all night at nothing.
But when a Burman sees a fox-terrier or any English dog his delight is
"unfeigned. When we first took Upper Burma, and such sights were rare,"
half a village would turn out to see the little 'tail-less' dog trotting
"along after its master. And if the terrier would 'beg,' then he would"
"win all hearts. I am not only referring to children, but to grown men"
and women; and then there is always something peculiarly childlike and
frank in these children of the great river.
"Only to-day, as I was walking up the bank of the river in the early"
"dawn, I heard some Burman boatmen discussing my fox-terrier. They were"
"about fifteen yards from the shore, poling their boat up against the"
"current, which is arduous work; and as I passed them my little dog ran"
"down the bank and looked at them across the water, and they saw her."
"'See now,' said one man to another, pausing for a moment with his pole"
"in his hand--'see the little white dog with the brown face, how wise she"
looks!'
"'And how pretty!' said a man steering in the stern. 'Come!' he cried,"
holding out his hand to it.
"to mystify the ruffian as much as I do."""
"""I will watch for his ears when he next calls, which, I expect, will"
"be to-morrow. Thank you very much. I won't sneak."""
"""Remember that nothing else in the way of identification is of any"
"use, for I doubt if either of us has ever seen the real, undisguised"
Dawson as he is known to God. We know a man whom we think is the
genuine article--but is he? Cary's description of him is most unlike
the man whom we see here. I expect that he has a different identity
for every place which he visits. If he told me that at any moment he
"was wholly undisguised, I should be quite sure that he was lying. The"
man wallows in deception for the very sport of the thing. But he can't
"change his ears. Study them, and you will be safe."""
Our club was the only place in which we could be sure that Dawson did
"not penetrate, though I should not have been surprised to learn that"
one or two of the waitresses were in his pay. Dawson is an ardent
feminist; he says that as secret agents women beat men to a frazzle.
Shortly before Dawson left for his headquarters on the north-east
"coast he dropped in upon me. He had finished his researches, and"
revealed the results to me with immense satisfaction.
"""I have fixed up Menteith,"" he began, ""and know exactly how he came"
"into communication with the German Secret Service."" The contemptuous"
"emphasis which he laid on the word ""Secret"" would have annoyed the"
Central Office at Potsdam. I have given the detected British spy the
name of Menteith after that of the most famous traitor in Scottish
"history; if I called him, say, Campbell or Macdonald, nothing could"
save me from the righteous vengeance of the outraged Clans.
"I'd studied all that out in our cabin, long before we'd lifted, on"
the transparent model of the ship hanging like a big cigar from the
"ceiling. Sis had studied it too, but she was looking for places like"
the dining salon and the library and Lifeboat 68 where we should go in
case of emergency. I looked for the _important_ things.
"As I trotted along the crossway, I sort of wished that Sis hadn't"
"decided to go after a husband on a luxury liner. On a cargo ship, now,"
I'd be climbing from deck to deck on a ladder instead of having gravity
underfoot all the time just like I was home on the bottom of the Gulf
"of Mexico. But women always know what's right, and a boy can only make"
"faces and do what they say, same as the men have to do."
"Still, it was pretty exciting to press my nose against the slots in the"
wall and see the sliding panels that could come charging out and block
the crossway into an airtight fit in case a meteor or something smashed
into the ship. And all along there were glass cases with spacesuits
"standing in them, like those knights they used to have back in the"
Middle Ages.
"""In the event of disaster affecting the oxygen content of"
"companionway,"" they had the words etched into the glass, ""break glass"
"with hammer upon wall, remove spacesuit and proceed to don it in the"
"following fashion."""
"I read the ""following fashion"" until I knew it by heart. _Boy_, I said"
"to myself, _I hope we have that kind of disaster. I'd sure like to get"
into one of those! Bet it would be more fun than those diving suits
back in Undersea!_
And all the time I was alone. That was the best part.
description. The name awoke in me a recollection of a painful incident
"within my experience. I saw before me the puffed, degraded face of one"
to whom I had given chance after chance of redeeming himself from
"thraldom to the whisky bottle, one who had promised again and again to"
"amend his ways. At last, wearied, I had cast him out. He had been"
"looking after an important shipbuilding district, had conspicuous"
"ability and knowledge, the support of a faithful wife. But nothing"
"availed to save him from himself. ""Give me five minutes alone with"
"your prisoner,"" I said to Dawson, ""and I will give you the spy you"
"seek."""
"I had asked for five minutes, but two were sufficient for my purpose."
"The draughtsman had been obstinate with Dawson, seeking loyally to"
"shield his wretched brother-in-law, but when he found that I had the"
"missing thread in my hands, he gave in at once. ""What relation is ----"
"to your wife?"" I asked. He had risen at my entrance, but the question"
"went through him like a bullet; his pale face flushed, he staggered"
"pitifully, and, sitting down, buried his face in his hands. ""You may"
"tell the truth now,"" I said gently. ""We can easily find out what we"
"must know, but the information will come better from you."""
"""He is my wife's brother,"" murmured the man."
"""You knew that he was no longer in my service?"""
"""Yes, I knew."""
"I might fairly have asked why he had used my name, but refrained. One"
"can readily pardon the lapses of an honest man, terrified at finding"
"himself in the coils of the police, clinging to the good name of his"
"wife and her family, clutching at any device to throw the"
sleuth-hounds of the law off the real scent. He had given his
"directed to the political aspect of the situation, he acknowledged the"
gravity of the disclosure. But honestly he could not pretend to think it
a thing which should alter or lessen the esteem or love in which
Medland's friends held him. And even if the original act were seriously
"worthy of blame, the lapse of years made present severity as"
"unreasonable as it would be unkind. In vain Medland reminded him that,"
"let the act be as old and long past as it would, the consequences"
remained.
"""What!"" Norburn cried, ""would any one think the worse of Daisy? The more"
"fools they!"" and he laughed cheerfully, adding, ""I only wish she'd let"
"me show her I think none the worse of her. Why, it's preposterous, sir!"""
"""Preposterous or not,"" answered Medland, ""half the people in the place"
will let her know the difference. I may agree with you--God knows how I
"should like to be able to!--but there's no blinking the fact. Well, I"
"must tell her."""
"He recollected telling the same story to the other woman he loved, and"
"he shrank in sudden dread, lest his daughter should say what Alicia had"
"said, ""To me it is--horrible!"" The words echoed in his brain. ""Ah, I"
"can't speak of it,"" she had cried, and the gesture of her hand as she"
repelled him lived before his eyes again. Surely Daisy would not do that
to him!
"""I should be like Lear--without a grievance,"" he said to himself, with"
"a wry smile. ""The very height of tragedy!"""
It was near midnight before he put away his work. Norburn had left him
"alone two hours before, and he rose now, laid down his pipe, and went to"
look for his daughter in her little sitting-room. His heart was very
heavy; he must make her understand now why a man who made love to her
to the exclusion of all other duties. This telegram informs me that a
"parcel has been handed in at Carlisle and the bearer arrested."""
"""Excellent!"" I cried. ""My time is at your disposal, Dawson. We shall"
"now get full light."""
He sat down and scribbled a reply wire directing the parcel and its
"bearer to be brought to him with all speed. ""They should arrive in two"
"or three hours,"" said he, ""and in the meantime we will tackle the"
draughtsman who made that plan of the battleship. Good-bye Mrs.
"Copplestone, and thank you very much for your hospitality. Your"
"husband goes with me."" My wife shook hands with Dawson, and politely"
saw him off the premises. She has said little to me since about his
"visit, but I do not think that she wishes ever to meet with him again."
"Little Jane, who kissed him once more at parting, is still attached to"
the memory of her colonel.
*       *       *       *       *
"Dawson led me to the private office at the Central Police Station,"
"which was his temporary headquarters, and sent for the dossier of the"
"locked up draughtsman. ""I have here full particulars of him,"" said he,"
"""and a verbatim note of my examination."" I examined the photograph"
"attached, which represented a bearded citizen of harmless aspect; over"
"his features had spread a scared, puzzled look, with a suggestion in"
it of pathetic appeal. He looked like a human rabbit caught in an
unexpected and uncomprehended trap. It was a police photograph. Then I
"began to read the dossier, but got no farther than the first"
"paragraph. In it was set out the man's name, those of his wife and"
"children, his employment, record of service, and so on. What arrested"
"my researches was the maiden name of the wife, which, in accordance"
"with the northern custom, had been entered as a part of her legal"
clinging to hope.
"But when another quarter had gone by, doubt became conviction. I had"
been fooled! Either some one who had seen me loitering at Krapp's in
"the morning and heard my tale had gone straight off, and played me"
this trick; or--Gott im Himmel!--or I had been lured here that I might
be out of the way at home.
"That thought, which should have entered my thick head an hour before,"
"sped me from the street, as if it had been a very catapult. Before I"
reached the corner I was running; and I ran through street after
"street, sweating with fear. But quickly as I went, my thoughts"
outpaced me. My lady was alone save for her women. The men were
"drilling, the Waldgrave was in the camp. The crowded state of the"
"streets at sunset, and the number of strangers who thronged the city"
"favoured certain kinds of crime; in a great crowd, as in a great"
"solitude, everything is possible."
"I had this in my mind. Judge, then, of my horror, when, as I"
"approached the Ritter Strasse, I became aware of a dull, roaring"
"sound; and hastening to turn the corner, saw a large mob gathered in"
"front of our house, and filling the street from wall to wall. The"
"glare of torches shone on a thousand upturned faces, and flamed from a"
"hundred casements. At the windows, on the roofs, peering over"
"balconies and coping-stones and gables, and looking out of doorways"
"were more faces, all red in the torchlight. And all the time as the"
"smoking light rose and fell, the yelling, as it seemed to me, rose and"
"fell with it--now swelling into a stern roar of exultation, now"
"sinking into an ugly, snarling noise, above which a man might hear his"
neighbour speak.
"I seized the first I came to--a man standing on the skirts of the mob,"
"inevitable, the conviction of the uselessness of sorrow, the vanity and"
selfishness of grief.
There is no meeting again with the dead. Nowhere in the recurring
"centuries shall we meet again those whom we have loved, whom we love,"
"who seem to us to be parts of our very soul. That which survives of us,"
"the part which is incarnated again and again, until it be fit for"
"heaven, has nothing to do with love and hate."
Even if in the whirlpool of life our paths should cross again the paths
"of those whom we have loved, we are never told that we shall know them"
again and love them.
"A friend of mine has just lost his mother, and he is very much"
"distressed. He must have been very fond of her, for although he has a"
"wife and children, and is happy in his family, he is in great sorrow. He"
"proposes even to build a pagoda over her remains, a testimony of respect"
which in strict Buddhism is reserved to saints. He has been telling me
"about this, and how he is trying to get a sacred relic to put in the"
"pagoda, and I asked him if he never hoped again to meet the soul of his"
"mother on earth or in heaven, and he answered:"
"'No. It is very hard, but so are many things, and they have to be borne."
Far better it is to face the truth than to escape by a pleasant
falsehood. There is a Burmese proverb that tells us that all the world
is one vast burial-ground; there are dead men everywhere.'
"'One of our great men has said the same,' I answered."
He was not surprised.
"'As it is true,' he said, 'I suppose all great men would see it.'"
expect people to spend the night outdoors.
"""So you've turned into a hotelkeeper,"" I said."
"""Well, you can joke about it,"" he returned, ""but all I do is to give"
shelter to the people who come here. That's all the hotel there is to it.
"My neighbor Olaus can't do any more either, even if he builds a place"
that's ten times as big. Look over there--now he's building another
"house--a shed, I'd call it--and he's got three grown men working on it so"
he can get it done by next summer. But it won't be much bigger than my
"place at that, and anyhow, the gentry don't want to be bothered walking"
all that distance to his place when here's my house right at the car stop.
"And besides it was me that started it, and if I was Olaus I wouldn't have"
wanted to imitate me like a regular monkey and started keeping boarders
which I didn't know the first thing about. But he can't make himself any
"different from what he is, so he puts up a few old bits of canvas and rugs"
and cardboard inside his barn and gets people to sleep there. But I'd
"never ask the gentry to sleep in a barn, a storehouse for fodder and hay"
"for dumb beasts, if you'll excuse my mentioning it! But of course if"
"you've no shame in you and don't know how to behave in company--"""
"""Lucky I've met you,"" I said. ""Why, I might have gone on down the road to"
"his place!"""
"We walked on together, with Eilert talking and explaining all the way, and"
assuring me over and over again that Olaus was a good-for-nothing for
copying him as he did.
"If I had known what was awaiting me, I should certainly have passed by"
"Eilert's house. But I did not know. I was innocent, though I may not have"
appeared so. It cannot be helped.
Tervueren road they met numbers of peasant refugees in carts and on
"foot, driving cattle, geese or pigs towards the capital; urging on"
the tugging dogs with small carts and barrows loaded with personal
"effects, trade-goods, farm produce, or crying children. All of them"
"had a distraught, haggard appearance and were constantly looking"
"behind them. From the east, indeed, came the distant sounds of"
explosions and intermittent rifle firing. Mrs. Warren was blanched
"with fear, her cheeks a dull peach colour. She questioned the people"
"in French and Flemish, but they only answered vaguely in raucous"
"voices: ""Les Allemands!"" ""De Duitscher."""
"One old woman, however, had flung herself down by the roadside,"
while her patient dog lay between the shafts of the little cart till
she should be pleased to go on. She was more communicative and told
"Mrs. Warren a tale too horrible to be believed, about husband, son,"
"son-in-law all killed, daughter violated and killed too, cottage in"
"flames, livestock driven off. Recovering from her exhaustion she"
"rose and shook herself. ""I've no business to be here. I should be"
with _them_. I was just packing this cart for the market when it
happened. Why did I go away? Oh for shame! I'll go back--to
"_them_..."" And forthwith she turned the dog round and trudged the"
same way they were going.
At last they came opposite the courtyard of the Villa and saw the
lawn and gravel sweep full of helmeted soldiers in green-grey
"uniform, their bodies hung with equipment--bags, great-coats,"
"rolled-up blankets, trench spades, cartridge bandoliers. Vivie"
"jumped down quickly, said to her mother in a low firm voice: ""Leave"
"everything to me. Say as little as possible."" Then to the farmer:"
"""Nous vous remercions infiniment. Vous aurez mille choses à faire"
"chez vous, je n'en doute. Nous réglerons notre compte tout-à"
"l'heure.... Pour le moment, adieu."" She clutched the handbags of"
that he would come to her--that his soul would enter the body of the
"little baby soon about to be born, so that they two might be together in"
life once more.
"And in the dream the lover consented. He would come, he said, into the"
child of the woman he loved.
"When the woman awoke she remembered it all, and the desire of life"
"returned to her again, and all the world was changed because of the new"
life she felt within her. But she told no one then of the dream or of
what was to happen.
"Only she took the greatest care of herself; she ate well, and went"
"frequently to the pagoda with flowers, praying that the body in which"
"her lover was about to dwell might be fair and strong, worthy of him who"
"took it, worthy of her who gave it."
In due time the baby was born. But alas and alas for all her hopes! The
"baby came but for a moment, to breathe a few short breaths, to cry, and"
to die; and a few hours later the woman died also. But before she went
"she told someone all about it, all about the dream and the baby, and"
that she was glad to go and follow her lover. She said that her baby's
"soul was her lover's soul, and that as he could not stay, neither would"
she; and with these words on her lips she followed him out into the
void.
"The story was kept a secret until the husband died, not long"
afterwards; but when I came to the village all the people knew it.
"I must confess that this story is to me full of the deepest reality,"
full of pathos. It seems to me to be the unconscious protestation of
humanity against the dogmas of religion and of the learned. However it
"""Mistakes be blowed--'e knows what's what, you take my word for it ..."""
"We gathered idly round the disputants, glad of a distraction that would"
help to pass the time. A third person joined in the argument:
"""If 'e bombs 'orspitals an' C.C.S.'s it's our own bloody fault. Look at"
our C.C.S. 'ere. There's a ordnance park and a R.E. dump up the road.
There's a railway in front an' a sidin' where troops is always
detrainin'. Then there's a gas dump over yonder. An' if we're bloody
"fools an' leave the lights on at night, 'ow can 'e tell what's what when"
everything's mixed up together? Why the bloody 'ell don't they put
C.C.S.'s away from dumps an' railways? Why don't they stick 'em right in
"the fields somewhere? I bet we'll cop it one o' these nights, an' serve"
"us right too."""
German aeroplanes had passed overhead almost every clear windless
"night, but the buzz of propellers, that often went on for hours, and the"
dull boom of bombs exploding far away had never caused anything more
than slight uneasiness and apprehension.
"One night, after we had been at the C.C.S. for about a month, we heard"
the uproar of a distant air-raid. Early the next morning a number of
"motor-ambulances arrived with their loads of wounded men. A camp, a mile"
"or two from the station, had been bombed and fifty men had been killed"
"and many more wounded. One of the ""cases"" brought into the theatre had"
been hit on the forehead. The bomb-fragment had not penetrated the
"skull, but had passed along its surface. The scalp hung over the"
"forehead loosely like an enormous flap, the red, jagged edge nearly"
touching the eyebrows. Since then I thought of this man every time there
was an air-raid.
"exactly how much--or, rather, how little money Slyne had had in his"
"pockets when he went ashore. And, if Slyne had already, within four and"
"twenty hours, been able to turn that over at a profit sufficient to"
"provide himself with a fur coat and diamonds, it might perhaps pay"
"Captain Dove to hear what he had to propose. Slyne, reading all the old"
"man's thoughts, could see that he had decided to temporise."
"""But, I can do with a damn sight less of _your_ back-chat!"" rumbled"
"Captain Dove, not to be put down without protest. ""If you've come back"
"on board to offer me a founder's share in any new gold-brick factory,"
"fire straight ahead--and be short about it. It'll save time, too, if"
you'll take it from me again that I'd rather have your room than your
"company."""
"And at that, Slyne made his next considered move."
"""All right,"" he said in a tone of the most utter contempt. ""That's"
enough. I'm off.
"""I came back to do you a good turn--although few men, in my position,"
"would ever have looked near you again,"" he paused in the doorway to"
"remark acridly. ""But I can see now what's the matter with you--and I"
only wish I had noticed it in time to save myself all it has cost me.
It's senile decay you're suffering from. You're far too old to be of any
"more use--even to yourself. You're in your dotage, and you'll soon be in"
"an asylum--for pauper lunatics!"""
He had evidently lost his own temper at last. And Captain Dove was
visibly pleased with that result of his tactics; as a rule he was better
"able to cope with Slyne on a basis of mutual abuse, heated on both"
sides; Slyne cool and collected had him at a disadvantage.
had acquired enough brazenness in the course of the summer not to
"hesitate, and approached the loud-voiced old man, holding out their palms"
"and clamoring: ""Money!"" But that did not suit the old man, who entered the"
"car forthwith, urging his companions to hurry. The driver, no doubt"
"thinking of his own tips, felt he would serve his passengers best by"
"driving off with them at once. So off he went. A toot of the horn, and a"
rapid fanfare--tara-ra-boom-de-ay!
"The spectators turned homeward, talking about the illustrious visitors."
"Foreign lands--ah, no, this country will not bear comparison with them!"
"""Did you see how tall the younger lord was?"" ""And did you see the other"
"one, the one with the skirts and the northern lights?"""
"But some of the homeward-turning bumpkins, such as the Olaus family, had"
more serious matters on their minds. Olaus for the first time understood
"what he had read in the paper so many times, that the Norwegian elementary"
school is a worthless institution because it does not teach English to the
"children of the lower orders. Here were his boys, losing a handsome tip"
merely because they could not swear back intelligibly at the gentleman
with the northern lights. The boys themselves had also something to think
"about: ""That driver, that scoundrel, that southerner! But just wait!"" They"
had heard that bits of broken bottle were very good for tires....

"I return to her knapsack and her clothes, and the reason why I do so is"
that Eilert is so little to be trusted. I want to count her clothes to
make sure none of them disappear; it was a mistake not to have done so at
once.
It may seem as though I kept returning to these clothes and thinking about
them; but why should I do that? At any rate it is now evident that I was
"earnest when he preaches on Truth, and he is in just as dead earnest"
"when, stripped of every moral scruple, he pursues a spy or a criminal."
"In pursuit he is ruthless as a Prussian, but towards the captured"
victim he can be strangely tender. I should not be surprised to learn
that he hates capital punishment and is a strong advocate of gentle
"methods in prison discipline."""
"The chief assistant stared, opened a drawer, and pulled forth a slim"
"grey pamphlet. It was marked ""For Office Use Only,"" and was entitled,"
"""Some Notes on Prison Reform,"" by Chief Inspector William Dawson."
"I had begun to read the pamphlet, when a step sounded outside; the"
"assistant snatched it from my hand, flashed it back into its place,"
and jumped to attention as Dawson entered. He surveyed us with those
"searching, unwinking eyes of his--for we had the air of"
"conspirators--and said brusquely: ""Clear out, Wilson. You talk too"
"much. And don't admit any one except Petty Officer Trehayne."""
"""The _Antigone_!"" cried Cary, who thought only of ships. ""The"
"_Antigone_! Is she much damaged?"""
"""No. Whoever tried to cut her wires was disturbed, or in too great a"
"hurry to do his work well. The main gun-cable was nipped, but not cut"
"through. She will be delayed till to-morrow, not longer. I am not"
"worrying about the _Antigone_, but about the new battleship"
"_Malplaquet_, which was commissioned last month, is nearly filled up"
"with stores, and is expected to leave the river on Saturday. We can't"
"have her delayed by any hanky tricks, not even if we have to put the"
"whole detective force on board of her. Still, I'm not so anxious as I"
"was. This _Antigone_ business has cleared things up a lot, and one can"
"sift out the impossible from the possible. To begin with, the"
"_Antinous_ was in for repairs to her geared turbines, and the"
"standing disconsolate in the dishevelled park, and spoke into the"
transmitter:
“Tell the gentleman that I need not repeat to him a description of my
ideals. He knows what they have been and what they still are. So far as
"they touch on this case, absolute loyalty and truth are the ones"
paramount. Tell him that I have studied my own heart as well as one
"can, and I know its weakness as well as I do its needs. That is why I"
"decline to hear his pleas, whatever they may be. I did not condemn him"
"through hearsay or doubtful evidence, and that is why I made no charge."
"But, since he persists in hearing what he already well knows, you may"
convey the matter.
"“Tell him that I entered the conservatory that evening from the rear,"
to cut a rose for my mother. Tell him I saw him and Miss Ashburton
"beneath the pink oleander. The tableau was pretty, but the pose and"
juxtaposition were too eloquent and evident to require explanation. I
"left the conservatory, and, at the same time, the rose and my ideal."
You may carry that song and dance to your impresario.”
"“I’m shy on one word, lady. Jux—jux—put me wise on dat, will yer?”"
"“Juxtaposition—or you may call it propinquity—or, if you like, being"
rather too near for one maintaining the position of an ideal.”
The gravel spun from beneath the boy’s feet. He stood by the other
"bench. The man’s eyes interrogated him, hungrily. The boy’s were"
shining with the impersonal zeal of the translator.
“De lady says dat she’s on to de fact dat gals is dead easy when a
"feller comes spielin’ ghost stories and tryin’ to make up, and dat’s"
why she won’t listen to no soft-soap. She says she caught yer dead to
"'You loved her so much,' I said. 'She was such a good wife to you."
Surely you would like to live with her again.'
"'But all that,' she replied, 'was in a former life.'"
Now she loved only her present father and mother. The last life was like
"a dream. Broken memories of it still remained, but the loves and hates,"
"the passions and impulses, were all dead."
Another little boy told me once that the way remembrance came to him was
"by seeing the silk he used to wear made into curtains, which are given"
"to the monks and used as partitions in their monasteries, and as walls"
to temporary erections made at festival times. He was taken when some
"three years old to a feast at the making of a lad, the son of a wealthy"
"merchant, into a monk. There he recognised in the curtain walling in"
part of the bamboo building his old dress. He pointed it out at once.
This same little fellow told me that he passed three months between his
death and his next incarnation without a body. This was because he had
"once accidentally killed a fowl. Had he killed it on purpose, he would"
have been punished very much more severely. Most of this three months he
"spent dwelling in the hollow shell of a palm-fruit. The nuisance was, he"
"explained, that this shell was close to the cattle-path, and that the"
lads as they drove the cattle afield in the early morning would bang
with a stick against the shell. This made things very uncomfortable for
him inside.
It is not an uncommon thing for a woman when about to be delivered of a
"baby to have a dream, and to see in that dream the spirit of someone"
"asking for permission to enter the unborn child; for, to a certain"
"extent, it lies within a woman's power to say who is to be the life of"
her child.
welcome it and then I would destroy it once and for all. I would enjoy
"my leave at any cost. It would become my only reality, and when it was"
over it would be a reality which I would take back to the front. I would
"hoard it and always think of it out there, so that the war would seem"
"like a dream, the end of which I could await with patience and"
resignation.
I went out to seek friends and acquaintances. I also hoped to meet some
war enthusiasts. I would tell them something about the war. How would
their theories be able to stand before my actual experiences!
I was soon disillusioned.
I dined with a wealthy kinsman. The slaughter of millions had brought
"him prosperity. He had never done any fighting except with his mouth,"
"but it is precisely that kind of fighting that infuriates the spirit,"
"engenders heroic ardour, and causes the nostrils to dilate. He was so"
"bellicose that he even desired to do some _real_ righting, not"
understanding the difference between the two. He thought of joining an
"infantry unit--the artillery were not good enough, he did not want to"
"fire at an enemy he could not see, he wanted to use the bayonet and"
murder his fellow men in hand-to-hand encounters.
I began to understand why many men I had met were glad to come back from
leave.
"I tried to dissuade him, although I felt it would do him good to see"
something of the war and he would learn a much-needed lesson. And yet I
"did not want him killed or horribly mutilated, although I knew that he"
"and those like him were alone responsible for the entire war, both at"
its origins and its continuance.
"upon you."""
"""Your remarks, Cary,"" I observed, ""are deficient in tact. You might,"
"at least, pretend to believe that my personal charm has won for me"
"Dawson's affection. As a matter of fact, he cares not a straw for my"
_beaux yeux_; his motives are crudely selfish. He thinks that it is in
"my power to contribute to the greater glory of Dawson, and he"
cultivates me just as he would one of his show chrysanthemums. He has
"done me the honour to appoint me his biographer extraordinary."""
"""I am sure you are wrong,"" cried Cary. ""He was most frightfully angry"
about that story of ours in _Cornhill_. He demanded from me your name
"and address, and swore that if I ever again disclosed to you official"
secrets he would proceed against me under the Defence of the Realm
"Act. He was a perfect terror, I can assure you."""
"""And yet he always carries that story about with him in his"
breast-pocket; he has summoned me here to see him at his work; and you
have been commanded to tell me everything which you know! My dear
"Cary, do not be an ass. You are too simple a soul for this rather"
"grubby world. In your eyes every politician is an ardent,"
"disinterested patriot, and every soldier or sailor a knightly hero of"
"romance. Human beings, Cary, are made in streaks, like bacon; we have"
"our fat streaks and our lean ones; we can be big and bold, and also"
very small and mean. Your great man and your national hero can become
"very poor worms when, so to speak, they are off duty. But I didn't"
"come here, at great inconvenience, to talk this sort of stuff at"
midnight. Go ahead; give me the details of this sabotage case which is
baffling Dawson and the naval authorities; let me hear about the
"cutting of those electric wires."""

"""And so on it goes,"" he said, ""indicating that at some devilish"
distance--I've forgotten the figure but we had the master computer chew
it out on the big machine at Radiation once--an additional kilowatt
just shoves the signal coverage distance out by a micron. But if you
"don't put in your honest kilowatt, you don't excite the infraspace that"
"carries infrawaves. And if you put in a kilowatt and a half, you have"
"to dissipate the half."""
"Wilson grunted. ""Nice to have things come out even. Who'd have thunk"
that the Creator wanted the Terran kilowatt to equal one quanta of
"infrawave distance?"""
"Allison laughed. ""Poor argument, Commodore Wilson. Actually, the figure"
"is point nine, eight three four plus. Close, but no cigar. We've"
"just come to accept the figure as a kilowatt, just as for everyday"
"calculation we accept the less refined figure of two point, one eight"
"parsecs, or even two point, two. At any rate--"""
"There was a puff of something, and a sound like the puncture of a tire."
The green speckles on the dome merged with one another and became
a riot of flaming green. There were shouts and cries and a lot of
haphazard orders and several techs scrambled to snap toggle switches.
Down the room one of the techs went head-first into a rack with a pair
of pliers and a soldering iron. He backed out carrying a smoking little
shapeless thing that had lost any character it once possessed. The tech
"picked up a nice, shiny new doodad from a small box and went into the"
rack again. When he came out this time he gave a hoarse cheer. Toggles
were snapped back and the spreckles reappeared.
"One of the techs came up to Allison and said, ""See that spot up there,"
"sir? The one just this side of the eighty-one degree longitude circle,"
"in his gorgeous chariot, driving furiously along the road which led to"
St. Albans.
"His boon companions, thus left to their own devices, went over to the"
"spot where the strange thing had befallen at the race, and where the"
country folk had gathered with shakings of the head and questionings
"beneath their breath; and there, plain for all men to see, was the"
"yawning hole with the open trap hanging down, and the marks of the heavy"
"fall of the good horse, whose escape with whole bones was little short"
of a miracle.
"An old countryman was holding forth to a knot of eager questioners, now"
swelled by Lord Sandford’s friends.
"""I mind well when there was a house here; ’twas pulled down when I were"
a young chap.  And the well must ha’ bin hereabouts.  That old trap has
"been in the ground ever since I can mind; but there be no water now, and"
"the sand has pretty nigh silted it up.  I’ve a-looked in many a time,"
and the hole gets less and less deep.  When I saw them setting up the
"brushwood and things here, I made sure they had covered the trap well."
"I walked about it, but never saw sign of it.  If I’d a thought of"
"danger, I’d ha’ told one of the fine folks.  I suppose they never seed"
it.  The grass and stuff do grow long and rank this time o’ year.  And
"so the gentleman’s horse trod on it, and it gave way with him.  Mercy"
"me, but ’tis a wonder he didn’t break his neck then and there!"""
"Lord Sandford’s comrades looked each other in the eyes, and drew a"
little away.  All knew that something strange had passed upon him of
"late, and that there was some rupture betwixt him and the man who had"
but lately accused him of seeking to compass his death.
"""Did he know?""  ""Was it plot or plan of his?"" whispered one and another;"

"""Bailey""; they are both ""nice men"" and little Jane's friends; she is"
"sure of them, and I expect that she is right. Children always are"
right.
"Dawson, after his outburst, glowered at me for a moment and then"
"laughed. ""I am a man,"" said he, ""though you may not think it, and I"
have my weaknesses. But I never give way to them when they interfere
"with business. Menteith is in my grip, and he won't get out of it. But"
he is a poor creature. He handed over the description of the
"_Rampagious_, saw it hidden in the sardine tin, and was ordered to"
take the food parcel to the Post Office. The German agent who used him
had no notion of risking his own skin. Then followed the discovery and
the arrest of the draughtsman who had drawn the plan. Those who had
seduced Menteith forbade him to come near them. They slipped away into
hiding--which profited them little since all of them were on our
string--after threatening Menteith that he would be murdered if he
"gave himself up to the police, as in his terror he seemed to want to"
"do. When nothing happened for two weeks, the vermin came out of their"
"holes, made up the last parcel, and forced Menteith to go to Carlisle"
"in order to post it. All through he has been the most abject of tools,"
and received nothing except the four pounds and various small sums
"spent in drinks."""

"""Yes, I have him tight. The others associated with him I shall leave"
free; they will be most useful in future. They don't know that we know
"them; when they do know, their number will go up, for they will be"
"then of no further use to us. It is a beautiful system, Mr. Copplestone,"
"and you have had the unusual privilege of seeing it at work."""
One evening after dark a young man prowled among these crumbling red
"mansions, ringing their bells. At the twelfth he rested his lean"
hand-baggage upon the step and wiped the dust from his hatband and
"forehead. The bell sounded faint and far away in some remote, hollow"
depths.
"To the door of this, the twelfth house whose bell he had rung, came a"
"housekeeper who made him think of an unwholesome, surfeited worm that"
had eaten its nut to a hollow shell and now sought to fill the vacancy
with edible lodgers.
He asked if there was a room to let.
"“Come in,” said the housekeeper. Her voice came from her throat; her"
"throat seemed lined with fur. “I have the third floor back, vacant"
since a week back. Should you wish to look at it?”
The young man followed her up the stairs. A faint light from no
particular source mitigated the shadows of the halls. They trod
noiselessly upon a stair carpet that its own loom would have forsworn.
"It seemed to have become vegetable; to have degenerated in that rank,"
sunless air to lush lichen or spreading moss that grew in patches to
the staircase and was viscid under the foot like organic matter. At
each turn of the stairs were vacant niches in the wall. Perhaps plants
had once been set within them. If so they had died in that foul and
"tainted air. It may be that statues of the saints had stood there, but"
it was not difficult to conceive that imps and devils had dragged them
forth in the darkness and down to the unholy depths of some furnished
pit below.
"“This is the room,” said the housekeeper, from her furry throat. “It’s"
"perverse, sportsmen's brains tingled and thrilled; they had successfully"
"eluded all the resorts on the way, and arrived here without being caught."
"There was the Blue Peak, like a mast against the sky! They hurried up so"
fast that Solem was hardly able to keep pace with them. They would have
felt for ever disgraced if they had neglected to stand on this admirable
"site of a disaster, this most excellent abyss. Some said it would be a"
lifelong source of regret to them if they did not climb the Blue Peak
"forthwith; others had no desire but to gloat over the lawyer's death fall,"
"and to shout down the abyss, gaping at the echo, and advancing so far out"
on the ledge that they stood with their toes on death.
"But it's an ill wind that blows good to none, and the resort earned a"
"great deal of money. Paul began to revive again, and the furrows in his"
face were smoothed out. A man of worth grows strong and active with good
fortune; in adversity he is defiant. One who is not defiant in adversity
is worth nothing; let him be destroyed! Paul stopped drinking; he even
"began to take an interest in the harvesting, and worked in the field in"
Solem's place. If only he had begun when the weather was still slow and
patient!
But at least Paul began to tackle things in the right spirit again; he
only regretted that he had set aside for the cotters those outlying fields
from which they were used to getting half the hay; this year he would have
"liked to keep it himself. But he had given his word, and there was nothing"
to be done about it.
"Besides, it was raining now. Haymaking had to stop; they could not even"
"stack what had already been gathered. Outside, three cartloads of fodder"
were going to waste.

chill horror of the unknown. Something had happened--that they felt.
Lois crept to the doorway and peered out into the gathering daylight.
"Here and there, half hidden behind the shelter of the trees, she could"
"see the khaki-clad figures of the Gurkhas, some kneeling, some"
"standing, their rifles raised to their dark faces, waiting like"
"statues for the enemy that never came. A dead, petrified world, the"
"only living thing the sunshine, which played in peaceful indifference"
upon the scene of an old and a new tragedy! Lois thought of her
mother. By the power of an overwrought imagination she looked back
through a quarter of a century to a day of which this present was a
strange and horrible repetition. For a moment she lived her mother's
"life, lived through the hours of torturing doubt and fear, and when a"
stifled cry called her back to the reality and forced her to turn from
"the sunlight to the dark room, it was as though the dead had risen, as"
though her dreams had taken substance. She saw pale faces staring at
her; she saw on the rusty truckle-bed a figure which rose up and held
"out frantic, desperate arms toward her. But it was no dream--no"
"phantom. Mrs. Cary, wild-eyed and distraught, struggled to rise to her"
feet and come toward her.
"""Where is Beatrice?"" she cried hysterically. ""Where is Beatrice? I"
"dreamed she was dead!--It isn't true! Say it isn't true!"""
Lois hurried back. In the confusion of their retreat she had lost
"sight of Beatrice, and now a cold fear froze her blood. She called her"
"name, adding her voice to the half-delirious mother's appeal; but"
"there was no answer, and as she prepared to leave the shelter of the"
"bungalow to go in search of the lost girl, a pair of strong hands"
grasped her by the shoulders and forced her back.
"""Lois, stand back! They are coming!"""
"about eleven.  With the instinct to take all the respite she could, and"
"knowing no more than before how she would receive his return, she went"
out in the forenoon and wandered about all day shopping and trying not to
"think.  Returning at tea-time, she went straight up to her baby, and"
"there heard from Betty that he had come, and gone out with his violin to"
the music-room.
"Bent over the child, Gyp needed all her self-control--but her"
"self-control was becoming great.  Soon, the girl would come fluttering"
"down that dark, narrow lane; perhaps at this very minute her fingers were"
"tapping at the door, and he was opening it to murmur, ""No; she's back!"""
"Ah, then the girl would shrink!  The rapid whispering--some other"
"meeting-place!  Lips to lips, and that look on the girl's face; till she"
"hurried away from the shut door, in the darkness, disappointed!  And he,"
"on that silver-and-gold divan, gnawing his moustache, his"
"eyes--catlike---staring at the fire! And then, perhaps, from his violin"
"would come one of those swaying bursts of sound, with tears in them, and"
"the wind in them, that had of old bewitched her!  She said:"
"""Open the window just a little, Betty dear--it's hot."""
"There it was, rising, falling!  Music!  Why did it so move one even when,"
"as now, it was the voice of insult!  And suddenly she thought: ""He will"
"expect me to go out there again and play for him. But I will not, never!"""
"She put her baby down, went into her bedroom, and changed hastily into a"
"teagown for the evening, ready to go downstairs.  A little shepherdess in"
"china on the mantel-shelf attracted her attention, and she took it in her"
"hand.  She had bought it three and more years ago, when she first came to"
"London, at the beginning of that time of girl-gaiety when all life seemed"
"a long cotillion, and she its leader.  Its cool daintiness made it seem"
"the symbol of another world, a world without depths or shadows, a world"
"ravelled round everything. Here men don't idealise women, by the looks"
"of things. Here they don't make these great leering eyes, the inevitable"
yours-to-command look of Italian males. When the men from the country
"look at these women, then it is Mind-yourself, my lady. I should think"
the grovelling Madonna-worship is not much of a Sardinian feature. These
"women have to look out for themselves, keep their own back-bone stiff"
and their knuckles hard. Man is going to be male Lord if he can. And
"woman isn't going to give him too much of his own way, either. So there"
"you have it, the fine old martial split between the sexes. It is tonic"
"and splendid, really, after so much sticky intermingling and"
"backboneless Madonna-worship. The Sardinian isn't looking for the ""noble"
"woman nobly planned."" No, thank you. He wants that young madam over"
"there, a young stiff-necked generation that she is. Far better sport"
than with the nobly-planned sort: hollow frauds that they are. Better
"sport too than with a Carmen, who gives herself away too much, In these"
"women there is something shy and defiant and un-get-atable. The defiant,"
"splendid split between the sexes, each absolutely determined to defend"
"his side, her side, from assault. So the meeting has a certain wild,"
"salty savour, each the deadly unknown to the other. And at the same"
"time, each his own, her own native pride and courage, taking the"
dangerous leap and scrambling back.
"Give me the old, salty way of love. How I am nauseated with sentiment"
"and nobility, the macaroni slithery-slobbery mess of modern adorations."

One sees a few fascinating faces in Cagliari: those great dark unlighted
"eyes. There are fascinating dark eyes in Sicily, bright, big, with an"
"impudent point of light, and a curious roll, and long lashes: the eyes"
"of old Greece, surely. But here one sees eyes of soft, blank darkness,"
"all velvet, with no imp looking out of them. And they strike a stranger,"
"""Yes, Dicon, and perchance it had been better had the luck been worse."
"I love not such gains as these. Besides, there is somewhat in this"
"beyond my ken. Lord Sandford desired my friendship and company then, and"
"luck was with me.  Now that he desires it no more, the luck has changed,"
and that so strangely and desperately that one might almost say there
"was magic in it."""
"Dick’s jaw dropped; he longed to know more, but feared to intrude too"
"much upon his master’s secrets. Grey, however, knew how faithful and"
"attached was his stanch henchman, and as he went through his morning"
"toilet he told him a little of the events of the past three days, in as"
far as he himself could remember them.
"""I have offended Lord Sandford doubly,"" he said, ""though he will not"
openly admit it.  But I know—I feel the change.  I trow that he is my
"enemy. Nay, Dicon, look not so aghast; it will matter little in the"
"future, since to-day I take my leave of him, and most like in this great"
"whirling world our paths will not again cross, either for weal or woe."""
"""But how?—what?  He did seem to love you well."""
"""I think he did; but a mischance befell.  He did not tell me of his"
"troth-plight to a fair lady—a lady of surpassing beauty, and of a virtue"
and purity which make her like a bright particular star amid the painted
dames and mincing damsels of this giddy London town. Twice or thrice did
I meet her and pay homage to her wondrous beauty and goodness.  It was
"words she spoke to me that decided me, ere ever any ill-blood had been"
"aroused, to leave off from this life of pleasure-seeking and"
"distraction, and seek a nobler career than that of the butterfly dandy"
fluttering round the town.  But Lord Sandford thought that there was
somewhat more than this betwixt us.  Of that I am assured.  A flame of
"Having arrived in the vicinity of the post, he prowled out on foot with"
"his only friend. It was early, for he must do his deed while yet the"
"lights were lit. Any one moving about after ""taps"" would surely be"
investigated by the guard. The country was not yet tranquil enough to
"permit of laxity in the matter of sentry duty, and the soldiers counted"
"""ten"" very fast after they challenged. He had laid aside his big hat,"
"and was wrapped in his blanket. Many Indians were about, and he was less"
"apt to be spoken to or noticed. He moved forward to the scout fire,"
"which was outside of the guard-line, and stood for a time in some"
"brushwood, beyond the play of the flames. He was closely enveloped in"
"his blanket, and although Indians passed quite near him, he was not"
"noticed. Suddenly he heard a detail of wagons clanking up the road, and"
conjectured rightly that they would go into the post. He ran silently
"toward them, and stooping low, saw against the skyline that the cavalry"
"guard had worked up in front, impatient to shave the time when they"
should reach their quarters.
"It was a wood train, and it clanked and ground and jingled to the"
"quartermaster's corral, bearing one log on the last wagon which was John"
Ermine and his fortunes. This log slid to the ground and walked swiftly
away.
*       *       *       *       *
"The time for ""taps"" was drawing near, and the post buzzed in the usual"
expectation of that approaching time of quiet. A rifle-shot rang loud
"and clear up on the officers' row; it was near Major Searles's house,"
"every one said as they ran. Women screamed, and Tongue River cantonment"
laid its legs to the ground as it gathered to the place. Officers came
"with revolvers, and the guard with lanterns. Mrs. Searles and her"
"daughter were clasped in each other's arms, while Mary, the cook, put"
her apron over her head. Searles ran out with his gun; the shot had been
honourable and dangerous service which I had no choice but to accept.
My dreams of love had gone to wreck. I could have deceived the woman
"whom I loved, for she would have trusted me and believed any story of"
"me that I had chosen to tell. But could I, an officer, a gentleman by"
"birth and I hope by practice, a secret enemy of England and a spy upon"
"her in the hour of her sorest trial, could I remain the lover of an"
English girl without telling her fully and frankly exactly what I was?
Could I have committed this frightful treason to love and remained
other than an object of scorn and loathing to honest men? I could not.
"In soul and heart she was mine; I was her man, and she was my woman."
"With her there were no reserves in love. She was mine, yet I fled from"
"her with never a word, even of good-bye. I made my plans, obtained"
"certificates of my proficiency in the _Vernon_, kissed my dear love"
"quietly, almost coldly, without a trace of the passion that I felt,"
"and fled. It was the one thing left me to do. My friend, that was two"
years ago. She knows not whether I am alive or am dead; I know not
"permission to spend the night with her father, and Baron Clyde called"
"about four o'clock to escort her. Was not that the hour, baron?"""
"""Yes, your Grace,"" I answered, bowing. ""I accompanied my cousin to"
"her father's house, returned later to fetch her back to the palace,"
"but she did not care to face the storm, so I remained till ten o'clock,"
"returned to Whitehall, and slept till morning. Here is another witness,"""
"I continued, laughing, as I turned to John Churchill, who was standing"
"near the king. ""Step forward, Churchill, and testify. I left him making"
"his suit to one of the most interesting ladies in London."""
"The king turned with an inquiring look, and Churchill answered: ""Yes,"
"your Majesty, it is all true. I was making my suit until near the hour"
"of eleven, when Mistress Jennings, who was ill, told me it was time to"
"go home. If she was kidnapped Sunday night, it was before five o'clock"
"or after eleven."""
"the girls seeking orchids, nor the hunter after his prey, dared to"
trespass upon that enchanted ground.
"'What would happen,' I asked once, 'if anyone went into that wood? Would"
"he be killed, or what?'"
"And I was told that no one could tell what would happen, only that he"
"would never be seen again alive. 'The Nats would confiscate him,' they"
"said, 'for intruding on their privacy.' But what they would do to him"
after the confiscation no one seemed to be quite sure. I asked the
"official who was with me, a fine handsome Burman who had been with us in"
"many fights, whether he would go into the wood with me, but he declined"
"at once. Enemies are one thing, Nats are quite another, and a very much"
"more dreadful thing. You can escape from enemies, as witness my"
"companion, who had been shot at times without number and had only once"
"been hit, in the leg, but you cannot escape Nats. Once, he told me,"
"there were two very sacrilegious men, hunters by profession, only more"
"abandoned than even the majority of hunters, and they went into this"
"wood to hunt 'They didn't care for Nats,' they said. They didn't care"
"for anything at all apparently. 'They were absolutely without reverence,"
"worse than any beast,' said my companion."
"So they went into the wood to shoot, and they never came out again. A"
"few days later their bare bones were found, flung out upon the road near"
the enchanted wood. The Nats did not care to have even the bones of such
"scoundrels in their wood, and so thrust them out. That was what happened"
"to them, and that was what might happen to us if we went in there. We"
did not go.
Though the Nats of the forest will not allow even one of their beasts to
"be slain, the Nats of the rivers are not so exclusive. I do not think"
fish are ever regarded in quite the same light as animals. It is true
"""My lord,"" he said, ""I have to thank you for many acts of kindness and"
"courtesy, and a certain liberality of treatment which I have received at"
"your hands and within your doors.  In taking my farewell, I wish freely"
to acknowledge all this debt.  But other matters which I need not
"specify, yet which are well understood by your lordship, have transpired"
to change the relations betwixt us; and I wish to add that I desire to
be beholden to no man.  In the rooms allotted to me in your lordship’s
"house there is a quantity of wearing apparel, jewels, trinkets, for"
"which I have no more use.  I pray you have them sold, and the amount"
thus realized will reimburse you for all charges you have been at in my
maintenance during the time I have dwelt beneath your roof. That is all
"I have to say.—Gentlemen, I wish you a very good day."""
"And lifting his hat with quiet dignity and grace, Grey made them a"
general salute and turned upon his heel.
"But Lord Sandford’s voice came thundering after him. ""Do you desire to"
"insult me, sir?  Am I a beggarly inn-keeper, that I should sell a"
guest’s belongings to pay my bill?  What do you mean by such words?  Do
"you desire that I should demand satisfaction for them at your hands?"""
Grey did not know whether this man desired to fasten a quarrel upon him
"or not, and, truth to tell, he did not care.  He just turned his head"
"over his shoulder, and threw back an answer in tones of scarcely veiled"
contempt.
"""That is for your lordship to decide.  I shall have pleasure in giving"
"any satisfaction demanded at any time, and in any place appointed.  For"
"the rest, a man who has sought to compass the death of a comrade by a"
foul trick need scarcely fear to soil his hands by the touch of his
"gold.  Again I wish you good-day, my lord."""
beliefs remain.
It is true that the taking of life is against Buddhist commands. No life
at all may be taken by him who adheres to Buddhistic teaching. Neither
"for sport, nor for revenge, nor for food, may any animal be deprived of"
the breath that is in it. And this is a command wonderfully well kept.
"There are a few exceptions, but they are known and accepted as breaches"
"of the law, for the law itself knows no exceptions. Fish, as I have"
"said, can be obtained almost everywhere. They are caught in great"
"quantities in the river, and are sold in most bazaars, either fresh or"
salted. It is one of the staple foods of the Burmese. But although they
"will eat fish, they despise the fisherman. Not so much, perhaps, as if"
"he killed other living things, but still, the fisherman is an outcast"
from decent society. He will have to suffer great and terrible
punishment before he can be cleansed from the sins that he daily
"commits. Notwithstanding this, there are many fishermen in Burma."
A fish is a very cold-blooded beast. One must be very hard up for
something to love to have any affection to spare upon fishes. They
"cannot be, or at all events they never are, domesticated, and most of"
them are not beautiful. I am not aware that they have ever been known to
"display any attachment to anyone, which accounts, perhaps, for the"
comparatively lenient eye with which their destruction is contemplated.
"For with warm-blooded animals it is very different. Cattle, as I have"
"said, can never be killed nor their meat sold by a Burman, and with"
other animals the difficulty is not much less.
"I was in Upper Burma for some months before the war, and many a time I"
could get no meat at all. Living in a large town among prosperous
"people, I could get no flesh at all, only fish and rice and vegetables."
"When, after much trouble, my Indian cook would get me a few fowls, he"
seemed as if the knots would barely hold. But the work had been well
"done, and in less than half a minute Steve had secured the sack to the"
"chair-back. It was as good as a gag, and safer. Then we took up the"
"chair between us, and lifting it into the back room, put it down and"
locked the door upon our captive.
"As we turned from it Steve looked at me. 'If he catches us after this,"
"Master Martin,' he said, 'it won't be an easy death we shall die!'"
'Heaven forbid!' I muttered. 'Let us be off!'
He gave the word and we stole out into the darkness at the back of the
"house, Steve, who had surveyed the ground, going first. My lady"
followed him; then came the Waldgrave; after him the two women and
"Fraulein Max, with Jacob and Ernst; last of all, Marie and I. It was"
"no time for love-making, but as we all stood a minute in the night,"
"while Steve listened, I drew Marie's little figure to me and kissed"
"her pale face again and again; and she clung to me, trembling, her"
eyes shining into mine. Then she put me away bravely; but I took her
"bundle, and with full hearts we followed the others across the field"
at the back and through the ditch.
"That passed, we found ourselves on the edge of the village, with the"
lights of the camp forming five-sixths of a circle round us. In one
"direction only, where the swamp and creek fringed the place, a dark"
gap broke the ring of twinkling fires. Towards this gap Steve led the
"way, and we, a silent line of gliding figures, followed him. The moon"
had not yet risen. The gloom was such that I could barely make out the
third figure before me; and though all manner of noises--the chorus of
"a song, the voice of a scolding hag, even the rattle of dice on a"
"drumhead--came clearly to my ears, and we seemed to be enclosed on all"
"sides, the darkness proved an effectual shield. We met no one, and"
"“Thank you,” said the girl, softly but heartily. “I am sure you need"
not trouble yourself any further. It was so awkward of me. And my shoe
heels are horridly common-sense; I can’t blame them at all.”
Chandler looked at the girl and found her swiftly drawing his interest.
She was pretty in a refined way; and her eye was both merry and kind.
She was inexpensively clothed in a plain black dress that suggested a
sort of uniform such as shop girls wear. Her glossy dark-brown hair
showed its coils beneath a cheap hat of black straw whose only ornament
was a velvet ribbon and bow. She could have posed as a model for the
self-respecting working girl of the best type.
A sudden idea came into the head of the young architect. He would ask
this girl to dine with him. Here was the element that his splendid but
solitary periodic feasts had lacked. His brief season of elegant luxury
would be doubly enjoyable if he could add to it a lady’s society. This
"girl was a lady, he was sure—her manner and speech settled that. And in"
spite of her extremely plain attire he felt that he would be pleased to
sit at table with her.
"These thoughts passed swiftly through his mind, and he decided to ask"
"her. It was a breach of etiquette, of course, but oftentimes"
wage-earning girls waived formalities in matters of this kind. They
were generally shrewd judges of men; and thought better of their own
"judgment than they did of useless conventions. His ten dollars,"
"discreetly expended, would enable the two to dine very well indeed. The"
dinner would no doubt be a wonderful experience thrown into the dull
routine of the girl’s life; and her lively appreciation of it would add
to his own triumph and pleasure.
"“I think,” he said to her, with frank gravity, “that your foot needs a"
"longer rest than you suppose. Now, I am going to suggest a way in which"
"I do not think it difficult to see how the sick man's face will lighten,"
how his eyes will brighten at the thoughts that come to him at the old
man's words. And he goes on:
'Remember when the squall came up the river and the boat upset when you
were crossing here; how it seemed as if no man could live alone in such
"waves, and yet how you clung to and saved the boy who was with you,"
swimming through the water that splashed over your head and very nearly
"drowned you. The boy's father and mother have never forgotten that, and"
they are even now mourning without in the veranda. It is all due to you
that their lives have not been full of misery and despair. Remember
their faces when you brought their little son to them saved from death
in the great river. Surely that is a pleasant thing. Remember your wife
"who is now with you; how you have loved her and cherished her, and kept"
faithful to her before all the world. You have been a good husband to
"her, and you have honoured her. She loves you, and you have loved her"
all your long life together. Surely that is a pleasant thing.'
"Yes, surely these are pleasant things to have with one at the last."
Surely a man will die easier with such memories as these before his
"eyes, with love in those about him, and the calm of good deeds in his"
dying heart. If it be a different way of soothing a man's end from those
"which other nations use, is it the worse for that?"
Think of your good deeds. It seems a new idea to me that in doing well
"in our life we are making for ourselves a pleasant death, because of the"
memory of those things. And if we have none? or if evil so outnumbered
"the good deeds as to hide and overwhelm them, what then? A man's death"
will be terrible indeed if he cannot in all his days remember one good
deed that he has done.
"'All a man's life comes before him at the hour of death,' said my"
"five minutes after leaving the house, reached the bank of the little"
creek I have mentioned.
"Here we paused and waited, a group of huddled figures, while Steve"
"groped about for a plank he had hidden. Before us lay the stream,"
behind us the camp. At any moment the alarm might be raised. I
"pictured the outcry, the sudden flickering of lights, the galloping"
"this way and that, the discovery. And then, thank Heaven! Steve found"
"his plank, and in the work of passing the women over I forgot my"
"fears. The darkness, the peril--for the water on the nearer side was"
"deep--the nervous haste of some, and the terror of others, made the"
task no easy one. I was hot as fire and wet to the waist before it was
"over, and we all stood ankle-deep in the ooze which formed the farther"
bank.
Alas! our troubles were only beginning. Through this ooze we had to
"wade for a mile or more, sometimes in doubt, always in darkness; now"
"plashing into pools, now stumbling over a submerged log, often up to"
"our knees in mud and water. The frogs croaked round us, the bog moaned"
and gurgled; in the depth of the marsh the bitterns boomed mournfully.
If we stood a moment we sank. It was a horrible time; and the more
"horrible, as through it all we had only to turn to see the camp lights"
"behind us, a poor half-mile or so away."
None but desperate men could have exposed women to such a labour; nor
could any but women without hope and at their wit's end have
"accomplished it. As it was, Fraulein Max, who never ceased to whimper,"
"twice sank down and would go no farther, and we had to pluck her up"
"roughly and force her on. My lady's women, who wept in their misery,"
"were little better. Wet to the waist, draggled, and worn out by the"
"clinging slime and the reek of the marsh, they were kept moving only"
"with difficulty; so that, but for Steve's giant strength and my lady's"
"word is given--to my people."""
"""I shall not plead with you,"" she returned steadily, ""and you may be"
sure I shall not waver. I am not afraid to die. I had hoped to atone
"for all the wrong that has been done you with my love for you, Nehal."
I had hoped that then you would turn away from this madness and become
once more our friend. To this end I have not hesitated to trample on
my dignity and pride. I have not spared myself. But you will not
"listen, you are determined to go on, and I""--she caught her breath"
"sharply--""surely you can understand? I love you, and you have made"
"yourself the enemy of my country. Death is the easiest, the kindest"
"solution to it all."""
Nehal Singh's brows knitted themselves in the anguish of a man who
"finds himself thwarted by his own nature. He tried not to believe her,"
"and indeed, in all her words, though they had rung like music, his"
"ear, tuned to suspicion, had heard the mocking undercurrent of"
laughter. She had laughed at him secretly through all those months
"when he had offered up to her the incense of an absolute faith, an"
"unshared devotion. Even now she might be laughing at him, playing on"
that in him which nothing could destroy or conceal--his love for her.
"And yet--! Behind him he heard the uneasy stir of impatient feet, the"
"hushed clash of arms. He stood between her and a certain, terrible"
"death. One word from him, and it would be over--his path clear. But he"
"could not speak that word. Treacherous and cruel as she had been, the"
halo of her first glory still hung about her. He saw her as he had
"first seen her--the golden image of pure womanhood--and, strange,"
"unreasoning contradiction of the human heart, beneath the ashes of his"
old faith a new fire had kindled and with every moment burned more
brightly. Unquenchable trust fought out a death struggle with
"distrust, and in that conflict her words recurred to him with poignant"
"significance: ""Death is the easiest, the kindest solution to it all."""
"All disclaimed any precise information, and Lord Sandford spoke no word;"
"his brow was slightly furrowed, and there was a subdued gleam in his eye"
which warned those who saw it that something in the conversation was not
"to his mind.  They therefore hastened to change it, and many of them"
said adieu and sauntered away.  Only a small knot remained with their
"patron, discussing the plans for the day; and Grey stood still in the"
"embrasure of the window, his heart still beating with curious violence"
"and rapidity.  When those men were speaking of Geraldine, he had scarce"
been able to keep his fingers from their throats.  What business had
they taking her pure name upon their lips?  And why had they spoken of
her fortune?  Could it be true that she was so great an heiress?  He
hated to believe it; yet what was it to him?  He was wakened from his
"reverie by a quick question from Lord Sandford, which he heard as"
"through the mists of a dream, and answered,—"
"""’Tis true I am not quite myself.  I slept not at all last night, and"
have been on the river well-nigh since sunrise to rid me of the vapours.
Methinks I will seek some sleep in mine own rooms ere night. Reckon not
"on me for to-day’s pastime."""
"""Ay, you have the air of a man squeamish and in need of rest.  Go get"
"thee a good sleep, friend Grey, for we must keep you in fettle for the"
match on Saturday.  Man and beast must come to the field strong and
"robust, with nerve and wind and muscle true and taut.  But you must make"
one of our party to Vauxhall to-night.  There will be many bright eyes
"on the lookout for the gay cavalier, as the ladies call you for your"
"love-locks.  You must not fail us there."""
"For a moment Grey hesitated, prudence and passion fighting together for"
mastery.  But the overwhelming desire to see Geraldine again—perhaps to
"speak a word of farewell—overcame him, and he answered briefly as he"
"strolled through the room on his way out,—"
"make nests and lay eggs and have little ones, and you went and shot"
them.' There are many sparrow-cotes to be seen in the villages.
"I might give example after example of this sort, for they happen every"
"day. We who are meat-eaters, who delight in shooting, who have a horror"
"of insects and reptiles, are continually coming into collision with the"
principles of our neighbours; for even harmful reptiles they do not care
"to kill. Truly I believe it is a myth, the story of the Burmese mother"
courteously escorting out of the house the scorpion which had just
bitten her baby. A Burmese mother worships her baby as much as the woman
"of any other nation does, and I believe there is no crime she would not"
commit in its behalf. But if she saw a scorpion walking about in the
"fields, she would not kill it as we should. She would step aside and"
"pass on. 'Poor beast!' she would say, 'why should I hurt it? It never"
hurt me.'
The Burman never kills insects out of sheer brutality. If a beetle drone
"annoyingly, he will catch it in a handkerchief and put it outside, and"
so with a bee. It is a great trouble often to get your Burmese servants
to keep your house free of ants and other annoying creatures. If you
"tell them to kill the insects they will, for in that case the sin falls"
on you. Without special orders they would rather leave the ants alone.
In the district in which I am now living snakes are very plentiful.
"There are cobras and keraits, but the most dreaded is the Russell's"
"viper. He is a snake that averages from three to four feet long, and is"
"very thick, with a big head and a stumpy tail. His body is marked very"
"prettily with spots and blurs of light on a dark, grayish green, and he"
"is so like the shadows of the grass and weeds in a dusty road, that you"
"can walk on him quite unsuspectingly. Then he will bite you, and you"
"die. He comes out usually in the evening before dark, and lies about on"
"footpaths to catch the home-coming ploughman or reaper, and, contrary to"
"""It was all very simple,"" he went on, ""like most things in my business"
when one gets to the bottom of them. He was seduced by a man whom the
"local police have had on their string for a long time, but who will"
now be put securely away. Menteith was a frequenter of a certain
"public house down the river, where he posed as an authority on the"
"Navy, and hinted darkly at his stores of hidden information. Our"
"German agent made friends with him, gave him small sums for drinks,"
and flattered his vanity. It is strange how easily some men are
deceived by flattery. The agent got from Menteith one or two bits of
"news by pretending a disbelief in his sources of intelligence, and"
"then, when the fool had committed himself, threatened to denounce him"
"to the police unless he took service with him altogether. Money, of"
"course, passed, but not very much. The Germans who employ spies so"
extensively pay them extraordinarily little. They treat them like
"scurvy dogs, for whom any old bone is good enough, and I'm not sure"
they are not right. They go on the principle that the white trash who
will sell their country need only to be paid with kicks and coppers.
Menteith swears that he did not receive more than four pounds for the
plans and description of the _Rampagious_. Fancy selling one's country
and risking one's neck for four measly pounds sterling! If he had got
"four thousand, I should have had some respect for him. His home is in"
"a wretched state, and his wife--a pretty woman, though almost a"
"skeleton, and a very nicely mannered, honest woman--says that her"
husband unexpectedly gave her four pounds a month ago. He had kept
"none of the blood money for drink! Curious, isn't it?"""
"""It shows that the man had some good in him. It shows that he was"
ashamed to use the money upon himself. We must do something for the
"poor wife, Dawson."""
"""She will easily get work, and she will be far better without her sot"
of a husband. She did not cry when I told her everything. 'I ought to
feeding or of police ferocity on Black Friday.
"Vivie declined any such propositions. ""I have told you already, and"
"often,"" she said, ""I am deeply grateful for all you have done for"
my mother and me. We might have been in a far more uncomfortable
position but for your kindness. But I cannot in any way associate
myself with the German policy here. I cannot pretend for a moment to
condone what you do in this country. If I were a Belgian woman I
should probably have been shot long ago for assassinating some
Prussian official--I can hardly see von Bissing pass in his
"automobile, as it is, without wishing I had a bomb. But there it is."
"It is no business of mine. As I can't get away, as you won't let us"
"go out of the country--Switzerland, Holland--and as I don't want to"
"go mad by brooding, find something for me to do that will occupy my"
thoughts: and yet not implicate me with the Germans. Can't I go and
help every day in your hospitals? If you'll continue your kindness
"to mother--and believe me""--she broke off--""I _do_ appreciate what"
you have done for us. I shall _never_ forget I have met _one true
"German gentleman_--if you'll continue to be as kind as before, you"
will simply give instructions that mother is in no way disturbed or
annoyed. There are Germans staying here who are odious beyond
belief. If they meet my mother outside her room they ask her
insulting questions--whether she can give them the addresses
of--of--light women ... you know the sort of thing. I have always
been outspoken with you. All I ask is that mother shall be allowed
"to stay in her own room while I am out, and have her meals served"
there. But the hotel people are beginning to make a fuss about the
"trouble, the lack of waiters. A word from you--And then if my mind"
was at ease about her I could go out and do some good with the poor
people. They are getting very restive in the Marolles quarter--the
"shocking bad bread, the lack of fuel--Most of all I should like to"
help in the hospitals. My own countrywomen will not have me in
"itself it lies under a spell. It is slow and dark, and has a surface"
"like a mirror, and it flows uphill. There is no doubt about it; anyone"
"can see it. When they came here, my friend tells me, they made a halt,"
and the Burmese hunters with him unpacked his breakfast. He did not want
"to eat then, he said, but they explained that it was not for him, but"
"for the Nats. All his food was unpacked, cold chicken and tinned meats,"
"and jam and eggs and bread, and it was spread neatly on a cloth under a"
tree. Then the hunters called upon the Nats to come and take anything
"they desired, while my friend wondered what he should do if the Nats"
"took all his food and left him with nothing. But no Nats came, although"
"the Burmans called again and again. So they packed up the food, saying"
"that now the Nats would be pleased at the courtesy shown to them, and"
"that my friend would have good sport. Presently they went on, leaving,"
"however, an egg or two and a little salt, in case the Nats might be"
"hungry later, and true enough it was that they did have good luck. At"
"other times, my friend says, when he did not observe this ceremony, he"
"saw nothing to shoot at all, but on this day he did well."
The former history of all Nats is not known. Whether they have had a
"previous existence in another form, and if so, what, is a secret that"
"they usually keep carefully to themselves, but the history of the Popa"
Nats is well known. Everyone who lives near the great hill can tell you
"that, for it all happened not so long ago. How long exactly no one can"
"say, but not so long that the details of the story have become at all"
clouded by the mists of time.
"They were brother and sister, these Popa Nats, and they had lived away"
"up North. The brother was a blacksmith, and he was a very strong man. He"
was the strongest man in all the country; the blow of his hammer on the
"anvil made the earth tremble, and his forge was as the mouth of hell. No"
one was so much feared and so much sought after as he. And as he was
"strong, so his sister was beautiful beyond all the maidens of the time."
"There was a great deal of traffic between the town and station, and it"
"was supposed that the passenger traffic would pay the contractor well,"
apart from his mail subsidy. For Burmans are always free with their
"money, and the road was long and hot and dusty. I often passed that"
"coach as I rode. I noticed that the ponies were poor, very poor, and"
"were driven a little hard, but I saw no reason for interference. It did"
"not seem to me that any cruelty was committed, nor that the ponies were"
actually unfit to be driven. I noticed that the driver used his whip a
"good deal, but then some ponies require the whip. I never thought much"
"about it, as I always rode my own ponies, and they always shied at the"
"coach, but I should have noticed if there had been anything remarkable."
"Towards the end of the year it became necessary to renew the contract,"
and the contractor was approached on the subject. He said he was
willing to continue the contract for another year if the mail subsidy
was largely increased. He said he had lost money on that year's working.
When asked how he could possibly have lost considering the large number
"of people who were always passing up and down, he said that they did not"
ride in his coach. Only the European soldiers and a few natives of India
"came with him. Officers had their own ponies and rode, and the Burmans"
either hired a bullock-cart or walked. They hardly ever came in his
"coach, but he could not say what the reason might be."
"So an inquiry was made, and the Burmese were asked why they did not ride"
"on the coach. Were the fares too high?--was it uncomfortable? But no, it"
was for neither of these reasons that they left the coach to the
soldiers and natives of India. It was because of the ponies. No Burman
would care to ride behind ponies who were treated as these ponies
"were--half fed, overdriven, whipped. It was a misery to see them; it was"
twice a misery to drive behind them. 'Poor beasts!' they said; 'you can
"see their ribs, and when they come to the end of a stage they are fit to"
fall down and die. They should be turned out to graze.'
"upon some great man, an attack against the Tories, the Whigs, the"
"Dissenters?  If so, they would read it; for there was great eagerness"
"amongst the people to read such things, and no matter what side was"
"attacked, there were hundreds eager to buy and to read.  But a"
romance—no; that was a mistake altogether.  A writer of successful
"pamphlets might perhaps find readers for a merry tale, or even a"
"romance; but for an unknown aspirant to fame—no, that was another"
matter.  No one would buy it; no one would even read it; though there
"were one or two who took it and glanced through some pages, praised the"
"style and the easy flow of words, and advised me to take to"
"pamphleteering, promising that they would read anything like that."""
"""That is it, that is it!"" cried the Old Lion, rising and pacing up and"
"down the room with his halting stride.  ""Write a filthy lampoon, a"
"scurrilous libel, a fiery diatribe against any great or notable man, and"
all the world will read and set themselves agog to know the writer.
"Look at Swift, with his ’Tale of a Tub;’ look at De Foe, with his crowd"
"of pamphlets—men of talent, I do not doubt or deny, but full of gall and"
"bitterness.  Yet they are read by all the world.  Fame, if not fortune,"
"has come to them, and fortune will doubtless follow.  The late King,"
"they say, would have made Swift a bishop.  The Queen will not: his"
ribald wit disgusts her; but he has admirers and patrons everywhere.  It
is the bold and unscrupulous who flourish like the grass of the field.
"True poetry and literary beauty are not asked, or even desired.  A pen"
dipped in gall is a pen dipped in gold in these days of party strife.
"And the genius that wields not this bitter pen sits in dust and ashes,"
"asking bread, and that well-nigh in vain."""
"""How should I write these party diatribes—I who know little of their"
"cries?  Whig or Tory, Tory or Whig—what care I?  The Tory of one"
Parliament is the Whig of the next.  Have not Lords Marlborough and
"Godolphin gone over to the Whigs? The Queen herself, they say, is"
feared. He is such a great Nat that it is necessary when you pass his
house to dismount from your pony and walk to a respectful distance. If
"you haughtily ride past, trouble will befall you. A friend of mine"
riding there one day rejected all the advice of his Burmese companions
"and did not dismount, and a few days later he was taken deadly sick of"
"fever. He very nearly died, and had to go away to the Straits for a"
sea-trip to take the fever out of his veins. It was a very near thing
"for him. That was in the Burmese times, of course. After that he always"
dismounted. But all Nats are not so proud nor so much to be feared as
"this one, and it is usually safe to ride past."
Even as I write I am under the shadow of a tree where a Nat used to
"live, and the headman of the village has been telling me all about it."
"This is a Government rest-house on a main road between two stations, and"
is built for Government officials travelling on duty about their
districts. To the west of it is a grand fig-tree of the kind called
"Nyaungbin by the Burmese. It is a very beautiful tree, though now a"
"little bare, for it is just before the rains; but it is a great tree"
"even now, and two months hence it will be glorious. It was never"
"planted, the headman tells me, but came up of itself very many years"
"ago, and when it was grown to full size a Nat came to live in it. The"
"Nat lived in the tree for many years, and took great care of it. No one"
"might injure it or any living creature near it, so jealous was the Nat"
"of his abode. And the villagers built a little Nat-house, such as I have"
"described, under the branches, and offered flowers and water, and all"
things went well with those who did well. But if anyone did ill the Nat
"punished him. If he cut the roots of the tree, the Nat hurt his feet;"
"and if he injured the branches, the Nat injured his arms; and if he cut"
"the trunk, the Nat came down out of the tree, and killed the"
"sacrilegious man right off. There was no running away, because, as you"
"know, the headman said, Nats can go a great deal faster than any man."
"Many men, careless strangers, who camped under the tree and then abused"
"him. ""O, I suppose she has gone out for a little,"" thought the giant,"
and he dipped his spoon in the kettle to try the dinner; but there was
"nothing but leather soles and rags and like rubbish cooked together, and"
he did not know whether it were mush or porridge. When he noticed this
"he began to see a light, and realize how matters had come to pass, and"
"he grew so angry that he hardly knew what to do, and made after the"
king's son and the Master Girl in flying haste. In a short time he came
"to the sea, and could not cross. ""But I know how to help myself,"" said"
"he. ""I will fetch my sea-sucker."" So the sea-sucker came, and lay down"
"and took two or three swallows, and thus lowered the water so that the"
"giant could see the king's son and the Master Girl out on the ship. ""Now"
"you must throw the lick-stone overboard,"" said the Master Girl, and the"
king's son did so. It turned into a tremendous large rock square across
"the sea, and the giant could not get over, and the sea-sucker could"
"drink up no more of the sea. ""I know quite well what I must do,"" said"
"the giant. ""I must now fetch my hill-borer."" So the hill-borer came, and"
"bored a hole through the rock, so the sea-sucker could get through and"
keep on sucking. But no sooner were they thus far than the Master Girl
"told the king's son to pour a drop or so of the bottle overboard, and"
the sea grew so full that they had landed before the sea-sucker could so
much as take a single swallow.
Now they wanted to go home to the father of the king's son; but he would
"not hear of the Master Girl's going afoot, since he did not think this"
"fitting for either of them. ""Wait here a little while, until I fetch the"
"seven horses that stand in my father's stable,"" said the king's son. ""It"
"is not far, and I will soon be back; for I will not have my bride come"
"marching home afoot."" ""No, do not do so, for when you get home to the"
"castle you will forget me, I know that positively,"" said the Master"
"Girl. ""How could I forget you?"" said the king's son. ""We have passed"
"through so many hardships together, and we love each other so dearly,"""
"said he. He wanted to fetch the coach and seven horses at all costs, and"
See it?

The first person to get the answer to the next problem
Doesn't have to go talk to Ms. Rinsky.
"Deal. ""Two trains are leaving the station at the same time..."""
Fine!
I'll go.
What was I worried about?
It had been months
Since I last saw ms.
Rinsky.
She might not even remember me.
Hi.
Ms. Rinsky.
Frankie Heck.
Brick's mom?
Ohh.
Not today.
She remembers me.
Would you like me to come back another time?
No.
Sit.
Talk.
Unburden yourself during my limited free time.
Okay.
"Well, see, Brick got a ""d"" on his math test."
"Sometimes kids get D's, but not your son."
"Oh, no."
He has to be perfect
"At every single thing he does, right, mommy?"
I...
"You know, ms."
"Rinsky, you're very funny."
Brick never mentioned how funny you are.
We're meddling.
- We're not meddling!
Oh.
Wait.
Is that an ambulance outside the Greenberg's house?
"Well, it's not an ice-cream truck."
- Saul!
"- Stay back, sir."
- What happened?
- Is it his heart?
Looks like it.
We'll know better at the hospital.
Stand back.
"- Er, where's his wife?"
- I don't know.
- What hospital are you goin' to?
- Honolulu General.
Lena?
Lena?
She's not here.
- Where'd they take him?
- Honolulu General.
- That's what his prescription says.
- That's not far.
- Wait.
What about Lena?
- We'll leave her a note.
No!
What would I say?
"""Dear Lena, Saul's had a heart attack""?"
- Stay here and break it to her gently.
- Wait a minute!
"Oh, she's about the same, thanks."
She appreciated your sending over that custard.
"Oh, excuse me, please."
Excuse me.
-That one seems superior to the others.
-Does he?
-I thought he had a sort of sensitive look.
-His mother's sick.
-Is he married?
-No.
-Is he a wolf?
"-Why, BIanche."
"-well, no, I don't think he would be."
-What does he do?
He's on the Precision Bench in the Spare Parts Department.
The plant that stanley travels for.
-Is that something much?
-No.
stanley's the only one in his crowd likely to get any work.
"Hey, BIanche, you're standing in the light."
Am I?
Gracious.

"If I live, I'll protect you."

This necklace is a family heirloom.
Wear it for protection.
Since when did you get so superstitious?
Don't eat without me.
Sit where you like.
I outgrew them.
I've been growing an awful lot lately.
I tower over everyone in Umbradge.
They laugh at me.
"So I've come to you, hoping you might understand what it's like."
"My dear girl, anyone with a head that large is welcome in my court."
Someone find her some clothes!
"Use the curtains if you must, but clothe this enormous girl."

You must meet them.
Fat boys!
Oh.

"Speak, boys."
Amuse us.
Go on.
(MOUTHING) No.

"-No, no, it isn't."
"Oh, good God, Ross."
"Nick at Nite, once in a while."
"All right, I'm going."
Bye.
"Phoebe, will you wait here?"
-I wanna get your opinion on something.
-Yeah.
How does Mona feel about Rachel moving in?
I'm on my way to tell her.
"She's been away all week, but she'll be cool."
She's been so supportive.
"She even got the baby a T-shirt that says ""Fossils are my friends."""
"Come on, Mona."
Don't kiss ass.
So I'm gonna take off.
"Oh, shoot!"
"Oh, shoot!"
Rachel wanted to see this tape.
-What is it?
-My friend giving birth.
Could you take it to your apartment?
"""Candy and Cookie""?"
"Candy's the mom, Cookie's the daughter."
The father's name is also Cookie.
Why am I friends with these people?
"Phoebe, come here."
I wanna show you something in the bathroom.
"Monica, grow up."
-What's behind your back?
-Something I want Phoebe's opinion on.
-You don't want my opinion?
-Not really.
"Staff meeting, everybody!"
"Snake, Robot, podium duty."

"Come on, let's go."
"Now, where is that..."
Oh.
"Hey, who moved my doodle pad way over here?"
"-How're you doin', Rex?"
-Were you scared?
Tell me honestly.
I was close to being scared that time.
"I'm going for fearsome here, but I just don't feel it."
I think I'm just coming off as annoying.
"Oh, hi, Bo."
Hi.
"I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock."
"Oh, hey, it was, uh, nothin'."
What do you say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
"Oh, yeah!"

"Hey, Woody, come on."
"Oh, thanks, Mike."
You got me out here with Matthew Stafford's little brother.
That's all I can get on such short notice.
- What do you want me to do?
- Collect them cones and pay little Stafford his beer money.
I'm taking a motherfucking Uber home.
I hate you right now.
You embarrassed me out there.

KWESI:
Anything with garlic.
"Everything OK, Jagjit?"
"- Yeah, it's all good."

Don't be scared.
It's just a bus backfiring.
Scared?
I ain't scared.
"Are you all right, son?"
Somebody after you?
"How would you like never to be scared again, Jagjit?"
"Teach him, till he's a master like you."
Why are you doing this?
You better do it.
I'm not sure I can stand the excitement.
"Sir, I need your registration."

Eventually.
"Uh, at the end."
"No, no, no, forget it now!"
Now?
"Well, pretend you forget!"
Pretend?
"Well, don't say anything to anyone about the horse!"
I know that.
You tell me that this morning!
- Basil...?
- So don't do it again!
I just thought maybe we could...
- Sorry.
- Are you okay?
JANINE:
Maybe if you just go over there.
"Just trying to you know, re-light the fire."
"Oh, honey."
Didn't you hear what I said before?
I really gotta finish these offerings.
Look I'm really trying here.
Do you wanna save our marriage?
Of course.
Me too.
"Tyrone, you cover 4 through 6 and pitch in with the bussers when you can."
Wait a minute.
I'm on 8 through 10.
"Hey, I been working here 18 months, 8 through 10."
ALEX:
Minor oversight.
"Luis, you cover 4 through 6, then."
"Dude, Luis quit like 10 months ago."
[WORKERS CHUCKLING]
MAN:
"Yeah, he quit."
Is there any reason we're even having this meeting?
Not really.
"- No, not for me."
ALEX:
Great.
Good.
Great.
Meeting adjourned.
Stop!
My son is out there!
"No, wait."
"It's me, Hogarth."
Remember?
It's bad to kill.
Guns kill.
And you don't have to be a gun.
You are what you choose to be.
You choose.
Choose.
GIANT:
Hogarth.
(WHIMPERS)
It's okay.
It's okay.
We gotta show them you're good.
"Nautilus to Rogard, missile armed and ready."
"What are you saying, he's friendly?"
Yes.
Attacking him is triggering a defense mechanism.
"Don't listen, General!"
Destroy the monster while we still have the chance!
(GIANT'S FOOTSTEPS POUNDING)
"General, you shoot and the whole thing starts all over again."
- Stop it now!
Our future's at stake!
"- Orders, sir?"
"Which is why you have got to stop, General!"
- It's getting closer!
"Orders, sir?"
- Don't shoot!
Is Mrs Ransom in?
"Yes, but I'm afraid she can't see anyone at the moment."
Then I'll wait.
"Please, couldn't you come back tomorrow?"
Mumsie...
Mumsie won't be in the least surprised to see me.
- Been rather an evening.
May I?
"- Yes, of course..."
No!
- It's bad!
Gone off!
Flies!
"- All right, all right!"
- (Door opens)
- It's Mumsie.
(Dennis) Good evening.
"Well, don't look so surprised."
"You expected me earlier, or did more pressing engagements banish it from your mind?"
"No, no, no..."
Of course I expected you.
- Won't you have a drink?
"- No, thank you."
- Your daughter warned me.
- Did she?
"Ethel, come here."
Excuse me.
Certainly.
Oh.
How did he escape?
- Who?
"- Dennis, girl."
Stay with me!
Warrick...
It's Grissom.
I was first on the scene.
Heard the shots.
I was in pursuit of the suspect.
What?
"No, Warrick, come on."
"Come on, Warrick!"
Where are the paramedics?
!
Please.
Please.
"Come on, Warrick."
You got to fight.
I need you to fight now.
"Fight for me, okay?"
Give me an ETA on the paramedics.
We need them here now.
No...
"No, come on."
No.

I was on my way to the diner.
I was going to tell Warrick in person that he could keep his job.
I parked my car over there just before 4:30.
I started to walk west towards the diner.
I was in this area here when I heard the shots.
I saw a white adult male running north down the alley away from the vehicle.
I checked the vehicle-- observed CSI Brown bleeding from a gunshot wound.
I'll put you up after Cassie.
"Arnie, listen, man, I had a sales call in Bakersfield and it went long, okay?"
"I--and I have to go get the groceries, you understand?"
I have to sit down and have dinner with my wife and kid.
I've gotta plan out this goddamn christening!
"What am I, Dear Abby now?"
1:45.
"You can be a fucking dickhead, you know that, Arnie?"
Heavy is the head that wears the crown.
Nick.
- [Nick] Hey.
"- Hey, hey, hey."
- How are ya?
- Good.
- How are you?
"- Yeah, good--good to see you."
Good.
This must be Tawny.
- [chuckles] Hi.
- Yes.
"My wife, Olivia."
Hi.
So nice to meet you.
"Last time I was invited to a house this nice, it had a grotto, so."
[laughter]
"Holy guacamole, I-I love marble."
- Yeah.
- [Tawny] Yeah.
"[laughs] Oh, my God, so cute!"
Can we have them for dinner?
'Cause I could just eat them up.
"Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum."
"I'm telling you, those moms are scary, snobby and judgmental."
And you're not judgmental?
"Hey, it's not called judgmental when you're right."
It's called right.
"I mean, I know Ritchie likes it there, but, God, I wish I fit in better, you know?"
Is this Portuguese?
Hold this.
"Yeah, it's close enough."
Let's go.
Give me a hug.
"Quick, big hug."
Ooh.
"- Adios, or whatever."
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Oh.
Your map of Portugal.
- Map of Portugal.
Right.
- There you go.
- Yeah.
Play nice.
"You too, Ritchie."
Ah.
Portugal.
Jewel of Iberia.
Largest producer of cork in the world...
And that's all I know about Portugal.
"And yet, you still might be the world's foremost authority."
"All right, I'm gonna get going."
I'll see you later.
All right.
How could I?
With all the stuff I was bringing.
"Nina, will Tasik bring Irishka from the kindergarten?"
"I must tell you something, only don't get scared, please."
- What?
- Stasik and I are separated.
- Divorced?
"- Not yet, but it's going to happen."
"- Oh, Nina!"
"- Mama, I beg you!"
"Oh, my God!"
"Mama, please."
"I'm begging you, mama."
I wouldn't have told you if I knew you'd be bewailing.
"How can you, you got a daughter!"
"I've just informed you, that's all."
I wish I'd never come here!
I'm going away from here.
Nina!
Nina!
"- What is it, mom?"
- They're there with those snags!
"And look, up there!"
Your man!
A real hero!
"Oh, mama!"
It's for me.
- Why for you?
- I swear.
Listening.
Playing again?
No brains mean a cripple.
The--the man who shot him...
"Lisa, what are you doing?"
DR PENZLER:
"And, um..."
hold on a minute.
EVERYONE:
Lisa?
Sit down.
Where do you think you're going?
Isn't this sweet?
Now we got the whole happy family.
Allie...it's okay.
Come here.
Come here.
It's okay.
DR PENZLER:
Ten adults and one child.
"That's right, exactly."
Sit down.
"Okay, here's the thing."
I don't want any cops.
I don't want any hostage negotiator or any of that Dog Day Afternoon crap...
Everything's gonna be okay.
I'm not gonna let anyone hurt you.
RAY:
"One SWAT team or anything, I start shooting these people."
Good.
I want someone here in 15 minutes.
"There is a problem here right now, Allie, but it's gonna be all right."
Ray is just a little angry.
"""Ray is just a little angry""?"
"No, Ray is majorly pissed off."
-What?
She must've crawled under there for warmth.
Are you fucking crazy?
You fucking killed her!
-I didn't kill her.
I must have sat on her.
-Jesus.
-My poor baby.
-I'm sorry.
"It was an accident, for Christ's sake."
How long have I said she shouldn't be on the furniture?
"It's because you were fucking high, Christopher."
You and your fucking smack!
Fuck!

-I'II get you another dog.
-I don't want another dog!
-Four in the side.
-One up the ass.
So nobody's heard from ralph?
I'm starting to worry.
-I'II call him again.
-Try the gay man's choir.
I read they were having tryouts today.
"Three ball, far corner."
Son of a bitch.
Where you been?
"This was in the mail for you outside, Tony."
UPS.
-What's going on?
-He's calling ralph.
Leave a message and leave your phone number.
Okay.
"Over here, right over here."
And do you know who I am?
Who are you?
Must have cleared 30 patients and no one's brawling yet.
See?
"It's not that hard, is it?"
Like the man said:
"""Can't we just all get along?"""
"Sam, weren't we sending the cracked Broviac up to lR?"
-Don't you want a CBC first?
"-Yes, you're right."
"-Sam, the labs done on Mrs. Garvey?"
"-Just checked, be another half hour."
"Dr. Weaver, the search committee meeting has been moved up to 12:30."
"All right, Jerry."
Thank you.

There's something not right about Glenda.
"Hey, that sounds like a movie, like, Something Not Right About Glenda."
"-A body snatchers thing, shaky camera."
Morris.
I wanna re-scan her.
Really?
Why?
Because she's altered.
"-But she's a drunk, how can you tell?"
-Dr.
"Clemente, why don't you--?"
I'm sure Dad would have been here if he could.
[SNIFFS]
She's such a slut.
So?
"Personally, I'm very pro-slut."
"-What happened, anyway?"
"-She banged Jamie Jaffe, that's what."
She gave him the reverse cowgirl and everything.
"Hi, Taylor."
How was your weekend?
"Fine, I guess."
You didn't go to the rodeo?

-You shouldn't listen to those jerks.
-Leave me alone.
I just mean-
"- I'm sorry, that's all."
You?
You never phoned me once.
I told you at breakfast.
I phoned you at lunch.
Why don't you get yourself in here!
"-Where do you want it, in the newspapers?"
-I'm sick and tired of chasing you.
You must be stanley.
I'm blanche.
"Oh, you're stella's sister."
Yes.
"Oh, hiya."
"Yeah, where's the little woman?"
In the bathroom.
"-well, where you from, BIanche?"
"-Why, I...."
I Iive in AurioI.
In AurioI.
"AurioI, huh?"
"Oh, yeah, that's right."
AurioI.
That's not my territory.
"Man, liquor goes fast in the hot weather."
-You want a shot?
"-No, I rarely touch it."
"well, there's some people that rarely touch it, but it touches them often."
Mind if I make myself comfortable?
My shirt is sticking--
please.
please do.
"""Be comfortable."" That's my motto, where I come from."
It's mine too.
It's hard to stay looking fresh in hot weather.
Your BB gun.
Where did you find that?
At the power station.
-Hogarth was there the other night.
-really?
"See anything unusual, Hogarth?"
Nothing...
"... unusual,really."
Gotta use the bathroom.
Strange he's tightIipped.
The other night he couldn't stop talking.
"I mean, 100-foot robots and whatnot."
A hundred-foot robot?
That's nutty!
What else did he say?
"No, wait, stop!"
Excuse me.
What is going on in there?
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
"You know, this sort of thing is why it's so important..."
... toreallychewyourfood .
A little privacy?
!
Sorry.
Sorry.
He's been acting strange lately.
That hurt.
"Thank you again, Annie."
"Good night, Hogarth."
I'm sure we'II see each other again real soon.
If you're gonna stay here...
The seven Dragonballs are gathered and closer ...
N-N-Do not tell me that ...
Do not tell me ... are there!
But what a great opportunity!
Pilaf Sama!
The food is itching!
My Dragon radar!
Wait!
Our food!
I do not need more of those crumbs!
It does not matter!
I found the seven Dragon Balls!
Let's put them as they were before.
you two!
There is nothing on the radar!
Surely there must have been some trick of hunger!
Eh?
Eh?
Eh?
!
And let out over the fish!
You are wrong!
I've seen them!
could it be that was ruined by the water?
This is protection against water...
I'm pretty sure I saw them!
I can not anymore ...
I'm hungry...
Listen up!
The Dragon Balls are on that cruise!
the boat is filling with water!
Remen with all his might!
Shh.
I will be dead soon.
Mallefille is going to shoot me.
(GASPS)
You two can't be serious.
Please.
"Please, Alfred, don't go."
Um...
- I'll talk to Mallefille.
- No.
- I want to die.
"- Oh, Alfred."
"Darling, I want to be on your conscience."
You destroyed my youth.
You buried my springtime in shadows.
Alfred.
I was much too good for you.
I spoiled you.
I gave you money.
I nursed you when you were sick.
Yes.
And then you fucked the doctor.
"God, Alfred!"
You were sick because you'd been out every night screwing all the whores in Venice while I was sitting at my desk writing so that we had a...
- (LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY)
- Oh!
The horse is a critic!
Get out!
"Kill yourself, I don't care!"
I hate you!
"- Gentlemen, are you ready?"
- Yes.
- All right.
Hello?
Okay.
Let's start again.
You're a math teacher and you want to eat dinner.
I sat in on one of your classes.
"- Rose, who's on the phone?"
- Be quiet!
- I'm sorry.
"- No, not you."
- Who's calling?
- I don't know.
Gregory Larkin.
Math department.
Columbia.
The theory of implicit differentiation is often thought of as complex.
"Uh, but in reality it is quite simple."
It's simply a matter of pretending that Y is a function of X.
"And so, um..."
Mmm.
Hi.
"Oh, hi."
- I saw you pass by.
- I was just passing by...
- I'm sorry about calling the other night...
- I was so confused.
- Are we on for Saturday night?
- Sure.
Good.
I'm looking forward to it.
Hmm.
Moi aussi.
"Oh, he's already left for work."
I hear him go 7:40 on the dot every morning.
Oh.
Does he live on his own?
Joe?
You bet he does.
Nobody'd put up with the grumpy old bastard.
"I'm Kieron, by the way."
We keep missing each other.
"Oh, Michael."
"Oh, let me get it."
"Oh, thanks."

"I don't want to scare you, Miss Khan, but it's possible anyone could gain access if they wanted."
So there was someone in here?
"It's not secure, that's all I'm saying."
The other day you said you thought she might have been killed.
I said I wasn't ruling it out.
"Got me thinking, though."
Hmm?
What if it was someone from here?
From one of the flats?
Why would one of her neighbours want to kill her?
-As in left or died?
-Died.
"- Well, I'm very sorry."
- We were hunted down one by one.
All that they died for is this.
It's a Purean.
It contains a collective data of human progression as well as Draconian war plans.
Information that could be very helpful in our cause in overcoming them.
- And how are you gonna get that to your people?
- A rescue ship arrives tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
-At sun fall.
-So you're going home?
-No.
I'm not.
Turn left up here.

"-Your friend, is he..."
-From here?
No.
She's Arctorian.
- I don't think I've ever met an Arctorian before.
Is she part of this interstellar alliance?
-They are.
-Are they here to help us?
-Very much so.
-Good.
That's good.
-They're here.
-My God.
-This is Robert.

"What do you mean, taking care of business?"
It's after midnight.
"- You know, uh, I had to meet some people tonight."

"[Woman] Yeah, well, finish all your meeting people and get back here now."
- And bring a pizza with you.

- You don't want any.
"Erm, I get the feeling you know what's going on here."
"Lena, talk to me."
'Dr Sigapelli to cardiology.
Dr Sigapelli.'
I thought it was his imagination.
He kept telling me he felt them.
He felt them.
Wait a minute.
Felt who?
"About two weeks ago, he started to act different, nervous."
"This week, it was worse."
He couldn't even sleep.
"And then yesterday, he..."
"Oh, hello"
Pick it up
Sada san I'm grateful
What for?
I was in the mood for something sweet
"Actually, Sada san"
"Why so serious, suddenly?"
I've already found him...

"Heisuke, right?"
He's a laborer in Kawaracho
That widow he's living with is a beauty

"But you got away, didn't you?"
You're a Pure Blood.
"You were born a vampire, and I was turned."
I'm unworthy.
"Come on, Chase, that is so old world."
It's not me anymore.
You're still with Marcus?
Of course.
But is he with you?

You didn't close the deal?
"No, it didn't go well."
Nothing has since Berlin.

Mathematical certainty.
You got a chance to finish this now.
You may not get another one.
"Alrighty, then."

Uh... .

"I think you can drop the ""honey"" part."
"Oh, Buck. I'm sorry."
I sure never wanted you to find out about Luther this way.
-Luther?
-What?
"is that your name, boy?"
"-Well, yeah."
BUCK:
Luther?
"-You gotta understand, Buck."
-What do I gotta understand?
Luther is the father of my baby.
But he wouldn't admit it.
"So l-- Well, I made a play for you, Buck."
"Oh, wait, are you telling me I was second choice to him?"
"No, no, it was only a play to force his hand."
"If you don't mind my French, all right?"
You be quiet.
He's off the force if he does not start answering questions.
You want to save your ass?
Start giving us answers.
And I'll tell you something.
We know anyway.
"So do yourself a favor, and stop fuckin' around."

Hey.!

- When your rep gets here.
- Fuck the rep.

Yeah.
"Hey, Moe, Harbor found one of Superboy's shoes."

Who's his lawyer?
- This guy Sloan.
- Sloan?
"Ooh, big gun."
Says he's grieving and all depressed for his nephew.
"Oh, Ray's all grieving and depressed."
He's originally from Chicago.
He and Ray got busted about six years ago for another drug rip-off.
They did two years together in San Quentin.
Prison buddies.

Pluto's a piece of work.
"IQ 150, college graduate."

He's got three priors.
"And for some reason, he left the videotape playing."

He left a calling card.

"Yeah, put him through."
"Chief Dixon, this is Dud..."
"Yeah, I'm fine, thank..."
Put him on the box so we can all hear him.
What's his name?
Chief Dale Dixon.
I'm going to put you on the speaker phone so we can all hear you.
We have Chief Jenkins here.

No shit.
"Wow, it's a pleasure to meet you."
"Good to meet you, Chief Dixon."
"Mano, Erik!"

"My beautiful boys, I you never see them."
We have to find a way to take you there.
"Honey, everyone is looking for a way out."
"If there is an exit, we'll find."
"Do not worry, Dad."
"Today, the Uncle Mano took an enormous elephant seal a large black hole."
But that hole was quite different.
-But he drew.
"-Mano, can bring a fish for my children."
"-For me, too."
"-Here, too."
"Okay, will do my best."
"Hey, listen!"
There's a way of freeing almost all of you.
"I'm going to delelândia, I'll bring some friends."
"Will be patients, all right."
Where you going?
-I take a shortcut.
-Of course not.
-You will be right here.
-But I'm quick.
-Erik.
"-Walk away, she is an athlete."
"Sorry, Erik, I will go faster."
Boadicea!
Which girl impossible!
I'm impossible even.
"-Then, boot to break, girl."
-Yay!
- Not for idea.
"Yes, yes."
- Not gonna happen.
"Strength, me dia."
"Then, Mr. Duncan Lloyd..."
Are you serious?
- Only when I can not breathe.
Did you really recognize that border guard?
A few years ago I made a film about Balkan beauties.
How do you speak Serbian?
- I've been here during the war.
We have a problem.
It must be from civil war.
"- No, there were floods."
Do you see all those locked woods there?
Water has passed.
A nice nuisance.
This is not a scene with a destroyed bridge.
It is a scene with a very different obstacle.
An obstacle to me and my past difficult.
Duncan!
Duncan Lloyd!
It's me!
Dragan!
OMG.
"What the hell are you doing here, man?"
I?
What the hell are you doing in my Serbia?

"All right, Brock, the door's open."
"It's temporary, anyhow."
"Who opened it for me, Bill;"

I don't know the party.
Ho!

"Brock, you're home."
"Papa, Brock's home."
"Well, were you still as lucky;"
"Oh, sure, I'm always lucky."
"-Stop that, play something else."

"Well, anything but that funeral march."
Play something with people in it.
Can't have a funeral without people.
Have dinner;
Yeah.
Ate at Bailey's place on the way out.

"I would've just gotten ice, but a possum died in the ice machine."
- Cool.
- Yeah.
- Why do we keep hurting each other?
- I don't know.
Maybe I'm overthinking it.
It just feels like we're not--
- On the same page.
- Clicking.
That was basically the same thing.
I count that.
- Yeah.
"- Look, I know this isn't the right time for some big talk, but I just-- want us to be normal again."
"- Yeah, me too."
- I hope you're a better kisser than Holt.

You mean like this?
Yeah.
Where did that come from?
My spa treatment.
Cupping.
Cupping?
Yeah.
"You know, I thought it was gonna hurt, but honestly, I snoozed through the whole thing."
"By the time I woke up, I was down two dress sizes."
"Before the cupping, did you eat any pudding?"
Darn tootin'.
Licked the bowl clean.

"Donna, do you remember who did this treatment?"
"Oh, yeah."

They're Feds?
Worse.
They're hunters.
Why are hunters here?
What do you want me to do?
"If you kill them,"
Boss will reward you handsomely.
"Before I do so,"
I want to get my hands on So Seo-No that wrectch.
"As you wish, Commander,"
I just want to get rid of them.
"Then I'll leave this to you, Commander."
Have a safe trip.
-Let's go.
-Yes.
Are we really going to kill them?
"If what he said is true, if he really is a Prince of BuYeo"
We'll get into deep trouble.
Capturing So Seo-No is our first priority.
"Han-Dang that rascal, I'm going to kill him."
Really?
Is that true?
"Yes, it is."
"Besides Ju-Mong, we have Oh-Yi, Ma-Ri, and Hyeop-Bo too."
We might even have a chance of nabbing So Seo-No.
I'm...

Sure!

"That offer's expired, yo."
It was kind of low anyways.
"But okay, okay, I'll take it."
Yes.
And absolutely the best car in this garage?

"Point is, I'm a good guy."
"Oh, no, you're a bad guy, sweetheart."

Let's gο get pissed in it.
I hοpe it lοοks better οn the inside than it dοes οn the οutside.
It's blοοdy industrial. lt's a strοng building.
Τhat's why it lοοks like that.
It's nice inside.
"Fuck me, it's Τrudy."
"- Oh, Τrudy!"
"Uh, well, Gibbs is right-  we should get going."
Yeah.
"- Yeah, we should."
6:30 flight out of Dulles.
Tony should be into Dulles about now.
DiNozzo-- that's who's missing.
His father's flying in from London.
Maybe you'll see him there.
Or maybe not.
Airport's gonna be nuts.
"Actually, I'm thinking the snow might thin the crowds a little."
"All right, well, we'll see you guys."
Nice meeting you.
Your attention please--
Do not leave any baggage unattended...
Are you sure I was okay?
You heard Abby-- you were adorable.
"But that Gibbs-- I was babbling away about Turkey, and he's just looking at me with that look."
The Gibbs look.
Hello?
Did you think I was making it up?
You were great.
Really.
You okay?
You seem on edge lately.
The flight?
"No, no."
I'm good flying.
Okay.
"Just, um, I don't know, the holidays, I guess."
I'm fine.
Okay.
I KNOW.
I JUST FEEL LIKE I SHOULD DO SOMETHING.
YOU SHOULD.
YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL BECAUSE SHE'S STILL OUT THERE.
[ CELLPHONE RINGS ] RIGHT ON TIME.
YEAH?
Evelyn:
Change your mind?
ENOUGH OF THIS.
"YOU WANT A DEAL, YOU DEAL WITH ME."
YOU LEAVE LUCY OUT OF IT.
Done.
Lucy has no more to fear from me.
"You see, I can be reasonable."
"Of course, I still have a job to do."
And the next target will have to be Sam or Fiona or... or -
- I know -
- Mommy.
"Sooner or later, I'll find someone you care about more than Doug."
So you call me when you want it to stop.
"SHE'S NOT LEAVING TOWN, IS SHE?"
THAT WOULD BE A NO.
Doug:
"IF SHE KNOWS ALL THIS ABOUT YOU,"
SHE'LL PROBABLY COME HERE.
SHE WON'T PLAY THIS OUT ON MY TURF.
SHE'LL KEEP THE PRESSURE ON UNTIL SHE GETS AN OPENING.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
"I'M A CPA,FOR CHRIST'S SAKE."
A CPA BROUGHT DOWN AL CAPONE.
THERE'S A REASON WHY THE FEDS WANT YOU TO TESTIFY.
I SAY WE HUNT HER DOWN.
I'm answering all your questions.
You're a fucking sadist is what you are.
A little.
"Wait, look."
Wow!
[Laughs]
Whoo!
"Look at these features, huh?"
"I mean, the fucking cheekbones right here?"
Are you kidding me?
I look like an angel.
- Look at that.
- [Camera shutter clicks]
[Laughs]
Babe.
"Oh, you look good."
Thank you.
- [Air hisses]
- Drew:
Try it.
That's original flavor.
I'm pregnant.
I probably shouldn't.
"Ah, it's harmless."
Every ingredient on that can is natural...
Or a near-perfect synthetic match.
"Okay, drew, I've got a lot of other meetings with sponsors."
What do you want to do?
I love Ryan.
You know that.
But I was at his last fight.
He did not look good.
Richie Rich.
Ooh-hoo-hoo!
- Here we go.
Break a leg.
- OK.
"Get off, you maniac."
"Hello, hello."
Shut up.
"Hi, God bless and if you can't be good, be careful."
Ho ho ho.
Right.
"It's full up in here, as the vicar said with his hand up Sam Fox's blouse."
Show us your tits.
"But seriously, folks."
The Good Lord gave us the gift of laughter.
- Get off!
- Ha ha ha.
"Thank God the likes of Tony Benn can't take that away from us, although he'd like to."
"Tell us a joke, then, you fat bastard."
I hear Arthur Scargill's blind stick lost his hairdresser.
"- You have to laugh, don't you?"
- Not at you.
"Two, three, four..."
Happiness
Happiness...
Thank you.
"God bless you, one and all."
- Get off!
- The greatest thing
That I possess...
"The smile of a child, a beautiful woman, just simply being..."
British.
Huh ?
"Oh, yeah, whatever."
"I mean, sure, if you want to."
We could start with everyone you've ever punched in the face since moving to Newport.
First would be...
Luke at Holly's beach house.
"Yeah, and number two would be Luke."
Right.
At the diner.
"Yeah, and again at the mall."
What about Holly's dad at Cotillion ?
That was more of a tackle.
Which takes us back to Luke.
"Yeah, in T.J."
"Summer, do you really think Pancakes is in the attic ?"
"Like he pulled down the ladder, hopped up and-and then put it away ?"
Hmm.
"Well, we have checked everywhere else."
Light.
Be careful.
Oh... gross.
It's okay.
What is that ?
That's Uncle Alistair.
That's your uncle ?
Yeah.
No.
"It's, uh, my dad's skeleton from med school."
He called him Uncle Alistair.
I don't know why.
"God, well, I don't want to meet any of your other relatives, so let's just find Pancakes and go."
Okay.
Did you see my ear?
Out of my way!
Here I come!
Here I come!
"Hey, look, its lasers light up."
"Take that, Zurg!"
"Quick, make a space."
This is where the spaceship lands.
And he does it like that.
And he does a karate chop action!
"Come on down, guys!"
It's time for games!
We've got prizes!
-What is it?
-Can you see it?
-What the heck is up there?
"-Woody, who's up there with ya?"
Woody?
-What are you doing under the bed?
-Nothin'.
Nothin'.
"I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all."
"Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose."
It's just a mistake!
"Well, that mistake is sitting in your spot, Woody."
-Have you been replaced?
-What did I tell you earlier?
No one is getting replaced.
"Now, let's all be polite and give whatever it is up there a nice, big Andy's-room welcome."
Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.
"Come in, Star Command."
"Star Command, come in."
You're a performing bear!
Are the countess and Monsieur Liszt at home?
"I will see, madame."
Is that the new baby?
She's adorable.
Can I hold her?
Darling.
- Countess!
"- Hello, George."
I just saw the new baby.
She's adorable.
Was it a difficult labour?
Very.
What brings you to Paris?
- My mother's ill.
- Oh.
I've been so depressed.
Seeing friends again will do me good.
How's Franz?
He's very well.
Have you seen the charming Chopin?
No.
- Why do you ask?
- Marie...
I've tried so hard to put him out of my mind.
You want him very badly.
"For a few heavenly minutes I thought I had him, too."
"In Angers, remember, I wore that dress."
Our eyes met...
You won't get him with a dress.
"On the contrary, my dear."
I know the man.
Miss Collins.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Miss Nancy Collins.
Please report to the Camellia Room in the station.
Camellia room?
Immediately.
Not that way.
In back of you.
Oh!

What an excellent day for an exorcism.
You'd like that?
Intensely.
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?
It would bring us together.
You and Regan?
You and us.
Did you do that?
Do it again.
In time.
"No, now."
In time.
"Mirabile dictu, don't you agree?"
You speak Latin?
Ego te absolvo.
Quod nomen mihi est?
Bonjour!
Quod nomen mihi est?
La plume de ma tante.
How long are you planning to stay in Regan?
Until she rots and lies stinking in the earth.
What's that?
Holy water.
They see here.!
Taking!
We are going to chain you.
"Away, cheater!"
"Old cheaters and putas, outside here."
It is necessary to denounce to him.
Also the other patients...
do not kill all.
"Lift up, lift up, still you are healthy."
You will already see tonight.
I do not hold more!
I do not hold more!
"Dr. Cicchirini, he has died."
"It doesnt matter, we put him inside and we take him to the morgue."
They have killed him.!
Assassins!
We will denounce to him.
We denounce to Dr. Cicchirini!
-Yes?
-Cicchirini?
-Dr.
Cicchirini.
-Police.
-Police?
-We have an arrest order.
An order?
For whom?
"We go, walks, you do not resist."
"We go, assassin."
Carrion.
"-But, I am Dr. Cicchirini."
We know
-Did you go to college to get stupid?
He's here!
Come on.
Stupid!
Surprise!
¤or he¤s a¤o¤ly good fe¤¤o¤ ¤or he¤s a¤o¤ly good fe¤¤o¤
That nobody can deny Nobody can deny...
They've killed the boy!
They've killed young Paolo!
They've killed your son Paolo!
Murderers!
Murderers!
My son...
"All my respect, Don Ciccio."
You killed my husband because he wouldn't give in to you.
And his oldest son Paolo because he swore revenge.
But Vito is only nine.
And dumb-witted.
He never speaks.
It's not his words I'm afraid of.
He's weak.
He couldn't hurt anyone.
"But when he grows, he'll grow strong."
Don't worry.
This little boy can't do a thing to you.
"When he's a man, he'll come for revenge."
"I beg you, Don Ciccio, spare my only son."
He's all I have left.
I swear to God he'll never do you any harm.
Spare him!
"Vito, run!"
Dude was bite-size.
That's funny?
"- Whatever, bitch."
"- Hey, watch your mouth."
"Are you almost done, man?"
Why?
You in a hurry to go to jail?
We can check on Alma.
She's probably in Recovery by now.
"- That means she's okay, then?"
- No.
She could wind up paralyzed.
"- Like, all over or just her legs?"
- They' re not sure yet.
"Well, better if they just killed her, you know?"
An hour ago you were ready for revenge.
"Yeah, that was personal."
"It was about my name, honor."
- But paralyzed?
That blows.
- Just dress the wound with Adaptic.
"Hey, Luka."
"- Piece of work, huh?"
- Yeah.
And she's pregnant.
- Who?
- The girl.
Says it's his baby.
You want to tell him?
No.
Do you?
Not really.
How about getting some credits today?
You told that the elderly man didn't ask for food.
It's not a big deal to find a hungry man in our city.
One moment.
I'm Deepa.
I work in a clothing store in a shopping mall.
I'm Varun.
"Cutting, baking, boiling and frying things."
This is my profession.
Did you just extend your hand?
What?
For an introduction?
No.
Sorry.
I forget this all the time!
It's okay.
No.
Let's start from the beginning.
"Hi, I'm Varun."
Deepa.
Varun...
Excuse me.
Have it.
- Thank you very much.
Shall we leave?
Here...
With no control
"Somehow, I am becoming you."
Without the eyes laying sight...
I am becoming like you.
The fiber of my life shines colorfully.
While killing me with fondness...
I can't control it.
(DISTANT SCREAMING)
(PANTING)
I don't know when I've had such good sport.
"Thank you, fair lady."
You must feel honored to be chosen by a baron.
Bring her to me!
(ALL SNARLING)
(SCREAMS)
(WHINNIES)
(GROWLING)
What's this?
You're one of our kind.
You're wrong!
I'm nothing like you!
I'm a human being!
Unbelievable.
How interesting.
You're a seriously confused fellow.
One only has to look at your eyes to know what you are.
Unless you're...
Can it be?
A hybrid?
Is that it?
Hello!
"Sorry to interrupt the hunt, Baron Howard!"
And who are you?
A hunter as well.
Only my quarries happen to be vampires.
What?
I wanted your last meal to be special.
"So tonight, you dine on the finest silver."
There's nothing going down.
Get some sleep.
Blast off.
180.
200.
Good Housekeeping Seal of approval.
210.
U.S. Government certified.
220.
Lunar trajectory.
Junk of the Month Club sirloin steak.
230.
"Grade ""A"" poison."
Absolute dynamite.
89% pure junk.
Best I've ever seen.
"If the rest is like this, you'll be dealing on this load for two years."
- So you're telling me it's worth a half million?
- How many kilos?
- [Sal] Sixty.
- Sixty kilos?
"Eight big ones a kilo, right?"
This stuff'll take a 7-to-1 hit on the street.
"And by the time it gets down to nickel bags, it'll be at least 32 million."
"Thank you, Howard."
"Take what's left there with you, and good night."
Uh-uh.
Not that one.
The little one.
"- I guess we got a deal, huh?"
"- What we got here, Sal, is a test."
A deal for half a million dollars?
Why don't someone go to the Chinaman's and bring back a load of chop suey?
-I'm losing and you want to eat.
"-well, I see you boys are still at it."
-Where you been?
-blanche and I took in a show.
"BIanche, honey, this is Mr. GonzaIez and Mr. HubbeII."
How do you do?
please don't get up.
"Nobody's getting up here, so don't get worried."
-Poker is so fascinating.
could I kibitz?
-You could not.
Why don't you women go on up to Eunice's?
-How long is this game going to continue?
-till we get ready to quit.
You should call it quits after one more hand.
-Go up to Eunice's.
"-Hey, that's my coat."
"That's not fun, stanley."
It makes me so mad when he does that in front of people.
-I think I'II go bathe.
-Again?
My nerves are in knots.
Is the bathroom occupied?
I don't know.
"-Oh, good evening."
"-Oh, hello."
"BIanche, this is harold mitchell."
"-This is my sister, BIanche DuBois."
-How do you do.
"-How do you do, Miss DuBois."
"-How's your mother now, Mitch?"
Don't worry.
"What are you doing, you stupid girl!"
She's very beautiful.
- Who is she?
- Your daughter-in-law.
It's 10 and she is still sleeping.
Had too much to drink last night?
"She is an alcoholic, mom."
"She and Gurmeet Singh will get along so well, I can't tell you."
Good morning.
Good morning.
"Gurmeet, Saira."
"Saira, Gurmeet."
My mom.
"I seek your blessings, mom."
She also pays respect!
"That's enough, drama queen."
I'll talk to you later.
Bye.
Are you alright?
I'm done for.
What happened?
Look at your hand.
What's happening?
"Quick to jump into bed, quick to propose."
- Awesome.
- Then what!
Yesterday we met your parents.
Today we met mine.
"So now we are kind of engaged, huh?"
Are you asking or telling me?
Do you have full on attraction?
You heard Rhodes.
He's got his hands full.
"Besides, we're running out of time as it is."
"Now, now."
Where's--?
Where's my journal?
D-d-don't...
"Don't, uh-- Don't touch... anything."
"What do you mean, we're running out of time?"
That's right.
"In fact, we've only got two days to find the treasure."
I can't even find my journal.
Why only two days?
Ah!
Ha.
Success.
"Professor, why only two days?"
Because that is when the first line of Solon's riddle comes true.
"I copied it, uh--"
"Uh, from an altar I found in--"
In the caves at Exeter.
Where is it?
Hm.
There we are.
There you are.
"""When the gods march in rank."""
What does it mean?
"Well, you saw the carvings on the Ark."
"Now, as you know--"
"I mean, when the Romans adopted the Greek gods, they gave them new names."
"Now, let's see, uh,"
Hermes became Mercury.
Wait here.
Hello.
"Good evening, boys."
- Have you got the stuff?
- What stuff?
- The Mickey Finns.
- What do you want 'em for?
"- Ask no questions, eh?"
"- I'm afraid it's our duty, madam."
- We're police officers.
Come along.
- (Sighs)
(Footsteps)
My dear Lord Mayley!
This is an unexpected pleasure.
"Laden with good news, I trust?"
- Yes... and no.
- Ah...
Hmm...
I'm willing to pay but the point is this - my wife's rich father is on his last legs.
- So?
- He won't last a year.
"She'll get the lot, I shall be able to extract."
A year?
"I gave you two weeks, remember?"
"- Yes but £10,000..."
- You're an insurance chief.
- You earn a lot.
- My wife spends a lot.
"- If there's any left, I spend it."
- Too bad.
"I don't know where I'm going to get £10,000."
Water...
"Good, we'll continue with his regular injections."
"Are you responsible for him, Ms. Cappia..."
Cappam?
"Cappi, Professor."
The needle...
"May we give you a hand, Doctor?"
Yes!
Yes!
"Come, come... this may hurt a bit!"
Now everything's ready.
- All set.
"- Just relax, relax..."
He requires an emergency operation.
I can't tomorrow.
I'm too tired.
Then there's the weekend.
I'll operate on Monday.
What is it?
Who died?
You!
- It must have been you!
- No.
We didn't do it!
- It must have been you!
I'll...
"- One, two and three... in my office!"
We always take her with us.
It's a bad habit.
"Courage, Doctor."
Courage...
It's always the three of them who organize these pranks.
"Hello, John Klein."
Who is this?
My name is Indrid Cold.
"Unless, of course, you're Gordon Smallwood."
"Your father was born in Racine, Wisconsin."
He lived in a green house on Monroe Street.
You don't remember how your mother looked.
"Okay, you got my attention."
- Where's my watch?
- In your shoe.
Under the bed.
"Very good, John."
Thank you.
What's in my hand?
Chap Stick.
"You're reading my mind, aren't you?"
Did you read my mind?
"I have no need to, do I?"
What's the third line of page 51?
"""A broken smile beneath her whispered wings""."
"Still more proof, John Klein?"
What do you look like?
It depends on who's looking.
I want to meet you.
"You already have, John."
I have seen you afraid.
"You're afraid right now, aren't you?"
Can I ask you something?
"Why ask me what you already know, John?"
What happened to my wife?
You were there.
Mary Klein cannot be found by looking.
Get outta here!
"We're here in Victory Lane, awaiting the results."
"McQueen, that was a risky move, not taking tires."
Tell me about it!
Are you sorry you didn't have a crew chief out there?
"Oh, Kori."
There's a lot more to racing than just winning.
"I mean, taking the race by a full lap..."
Where's the entertainment in that?
I wanted to give folks a little sizzle.
- Sizzle?
- Am I sorry I don't have a crew chief?
"No, I'm not."
'Cause I'm a one-man show.
What?
"Oh, yeah, right."
That was a confident Lightning McQueen.
"Live from Victory Lane, I'm Kori Turbowitz."
- Get outta the shot.
"- Yo, Chuck."
"Chuck, what are you doing?"
You're blocking' the camera!
- Everyone wants to see the bolt.
- What?
"- Now, back away."
- That's it!
"Come on, guys."
"- Whoa, team!"
Where are you going?
"- We quit, Mr. One-Man Show!"
"Oh, OK, leave."
Fine.
- Your sisters.
JANINE:
"I mean, everyone makes mistakes."
"I've started trying to figure out what I wanna do, who I wanna be, you know?"
"Probably seems the wrong time to do that, but why not?"
"You know, why not?"
Better later than never.
I'm dating now.
MAN:
What do you miss most about marriage?
Have you been married?
MAN:
"Yes, I'm married."
- You are married?
MAN:
I am married.
And what's your question?
MARY:
"We're heading there, is that fair?"
CONOR:
It's moving fast.
Just on our way.
"I like him, I'll say that L word."
"That's true, it does start with an L. Yeah."
"I like her a lot, so..."
"- Good, I'm glad."
[MOUTHING] I love her.
I love her.
ANNA:
"You know, what I've been focusing my energy on  is like a self-discovery, as opposed to dating."
I don't know.
Maybe dating's a little overrated.
All right.
What do you got to drink around here?
We don't have much time.
"Soon they will come to harm you, and I will not be able to stop them, unless you are able to give me something to placate them."
"Some, uh, piece of information... which I can use to protect you from them."
I've already told you everything I know.
I have no loyalty to Jones.
He's brought me nothing but trouble.
"Marion, you are beautiful."
I don't think we need a chaperone.
Steadily.
Steadily.
Whoa!
Down...
Down...
Whoa.
"Carefully, carefully!"
"You all right, Indy?"
"Now gently, boys."
"Gently, gently!"
Whoa...
I told you it will be all right.
Huh...
"Sallah, get down here!"
You pour.
"Oh, that's good."
Whoops.
"What is this stuff, René?"
I grew up with this.
It's my family label.
Well...
"I have to be going now, René."
What did he say?
Precisely what he's been asked to say.
"Sir, your mail."
Turn it around.
Your flight for Mumbai leaves in two hours.
Our associate will get in touch with you.
He will brief you about the rest.
Is this what you really want?
Neil?
"Yes, I want this."
Mumbai?
"In this business enemies are aplenty, Ranbir."
But there is only one Maya.
This is a risk I cannot take.
Hello
"Hello, could you please send somebody to room 607 to collect the bag?"
"Yeah, thank you."
It's open.
You shouldn't leave your door open like this.
Never know who could enter.
Put your hands up.
Put them up!
Don't be dramatic.
Sit.
We need to talk.
Talk about what?
The truth.
It's weighing on me like a ton.
Is that so?
Shall we start?
Bangkok...
O.P. Ramsay?
"Veal, twice, please."
"Oh, and semolina pudding?"
Excellent choice.
Too long.
Lose half.
- Which half?
- The half you don't need.
- What's the matter?
You look like you haven't slept in a month.
I'm all right.
I just found it easier when it was every night.
At least you knew what was coming.
"Well, never having known the joys of married love myself--"
- The bombing.
- Ah.
I thought perhaps too many long treks to see the husband in the provinces.
Not really.
"It's difficult, you know?"
The trains.
"- All right, then"
What's that?
"- It's France, Uncle Frank."
- Oh.
- Oh!
It's Hitler!
- Bloody what?
- Meeting now with Mr. Swain.
Rot.
We're about to issue this as a shooting script.
- They want all of you.
"- Oh, no."
"Oh, don't worry."
- They're here because Rory invited them.
They can't say no to that little face.
It's like hitting a puppy with a rolled-up newspaper.
You guys are not gonna believe this.
- You're Mr. Announcement Guy today.
- You'll pipe in every time I talk?
- Can it.
- Stuff it.
- They're in love.
- Clearly.
"Mrs. Got Bucks out there not only has a cameraman, she's got a sound guy, too."
It's like a Baz Luhrmann movie out there.
"That's Emily, right?"
- Rich people feel so entitled.
"- Yes, damn them."
I saw her wipe her face with a $100 bill.
We should line them up against a wall.
You know what I'm saying?
- Is Lorelei Gilmore here?
- Yes.
Good.
"Have a look at these, will you?"
- Wow.
Pretty.
- Look them over and take your pick.
- What for?
- To wear.
- Are they for sale?
- No.
They're paid for.
"These are from your mother, Emily Gilmore."
- Wow.
Should be just around the corner.
It's number 24.
24.
24!
- 24.
- Are you done?
"Sorry, let's do this."
What's the guy name?
Her who was it?
- Her ex-boyfriend?
- No!
"No, the ex-boyfriend had an alibi and he checked..."
God.
"That's right, you weren't at the meeting this morning."
But I had to shop for a dress.
I can't wear the same thing every show.
I had to wear the same blouse three times last week.
Three!
Three.
"Three, tres, three."
- Hello.
- Sorry.
Just remind me.
"All right, his name is Malcolm O'dwyer."
He's some kind of lottery fanatic.
Wrote a bunch of fan letters to Marissa before she was killed.
Hey!
I'm a big fan!
- Thank you very much.
- Not you.
The Lotto girl.
You'll thank me later!
"He'll understand, believe me."
Connie.
"If you don't listen to me and marry this man,"
you'll disappoint me.
-Famiglia!
-Cent' anni!
"What's ""Chen dannay""?"
"""Cent' anni""."
It means 100 years.
It means we should all live happily for 100 years.
The family.
-It would be true if my father were alive.
-Connie.
Hey...
"Merle, you've met my sister-in-law, Deanna."
-Fredo's wife.
-My pleasure.
"With all respect, I didn't come here to eat dinner!"
"I know, I know."
-I just want to dance!
-You're falling all over the floor.
You're justjealous because he's a real man!
-I'm going to belt you right in the teeth.
-You couldn't belt your mama!
These Dagos are crazy when it comes to their wives.
"Michael says that if you can't take care of this, I have to."
-I think you'd better.
-Never marry a Wop.
They treat their wives like shit!
I didn't mean to say Wop.
Don't!
"What are you doing to me, you big slob?"
Aunt Letha!
"Oh, aunt Letha."
Help.
Aunt Letha?
Aunt Letha?
It's absolutely dreadful the way they bring up children these days.
Come on.
"Tony, the bus won't run without me in it."
It's all my fault.
It's such a mess.
"Well, I guess we'll just have to fix it."
I'm sure Uncle Bene won't mind.
I'll do the engine.
You do the body work.
- OK.
"- So long, Alfie."
"Goodbye, Alfred."
"What job will you do now, Mr. Yo-Yo, uh, Yokomoto?"
"Oh, I've saved my money."
I'll probably open a Japanese delicatessen.
"Hey, kids, look."
I don't understand this.
- Man!
"- Wow, what a family."
The molecules must have rearranged themselves...
- ...somehow.
"- Uh, that's a possibility."
You know what this means?
They never saw the wreck.
I'll tell them that the reports were exaggerated.
"And, if you kids will go back to school,"
I'm sure they won't fire me.
- Because they were laughing.
- I drew a sketch for you.
"This one is a 2CV, with round headlights on the hood."
And the Dyane 6 has them built in.
It was more like this one.
The Dyane 6.
- Who are they?
- Pickers.
Here for the harvest.
He's from the town.
They know him.
Could be a picker who comes every year.
Or someone who works at the fair.
The father has a Dyane 6.
Yellow.
It was parked outside the house.
Yellow looks like white at night.
- And gray.
It's a common car.
- Excuse me.
Someone wants to talk to you.
"Angelita is psychic, she sees stuff."
She talks to the dead in her sleep.
She asks them what she wants to know and the dead tell her.
Have a seat.
I've been talking to my dead mother the last two nights.
And she said... she saw the girls at the abandoned farmhouse.
- Something wrong?
- Nothing.
LONG LIVE FRANCO VICTORY WAS OURS AND ALWAYS WILL BE
Pedro!
Over here!
She'll be lucky to get married.
You'll be lucky to avoid getting married.
- To who?
- Don't ask.
- You're expendable.
- Eli's in love.
- Would you like to bring her?
- You know her.
Gracie's friend Carla.
"Oh, my goodness."
Really?
She's so lively.
"Yeah, lively, that's her."
- She's bizarro.
- That's you.
"- You're welcome to bring her, Eli."
"- Okay, I'll ask her."
"Dad, did you read my essay?"
"When you write it, I'll read it."
"Oh, my God, that reminds me."
That money for the pictures was due yesterday.
If you'll give me the form like I keep asking...
"Oh, Rick what is it?"
I've been subpoenaed to appear.
Subpoenaed?
To appear where?
Before a grand jury investigation of the Atlantor project.
[Rick] No.
You're right.
"Walter, this is unbelievable."
Okay.
All right.
"It was a hard thing for her to go through, but she's one in a thousand."
No one else will ever be like her.

2000 AD Summer
"We couldn't have known how important, ...that summer would turn out to be."
Until that day...
"Hey, wait up!"
"Toshi, slow down."
I'm the boss.
Slaves follow!
That's not fair!
Don't run.
Watch out for gopher holes!
I still can't believe it.
"Shut up, will you?"
"Fell right in, and bumped your head."
Weren't you gonna warn me?
No!
"You saw us jump, yeah?"
You should've figured it out.
"Let's finish this, ...or we'll miss the campfire."
What's that?
"Toshi, wait!"
- He's always like this.
- Don't leave us!
Ouch.
Yusuki?
Misaki?
You scared me.

Um...
Brent?
We can't talk here.
What?
Why not?
Count to 15 before you follow me.
"Second thought, make that 20."
Brent!
I said 20.
What has gotten into you?
You've become a cub scout?
No.
These two fingers represent the pause button.
On our friendship.
What?
River Rock Publishing is in the middle of a cold war.
"I'm America, and you're the USSR."
That's ridiculous.
Crossing enemy lines is a mistake.
It complicates things.
"Oh, Brent, come on."
This is crazy.
How long can you two keep this up?
Don't blame me.
Blame Julianne.
"By the way, fierce heels."
I am the one that's paid the lion's share of the mortgage!
I am the one that's bought the groceries!
I paid the bills!
I--I arranged and funded all of our vacations!
"Don't yell, Quico."
You'll wake everyone up.
"Get back here, please."
Did you like the private tutor?
Math is a little hard.
"If you have any trouble here in school, Maria, you can see me."
Let's meet your classmates.
- Come on.
- Wait...
Get the ball.
You get it!
This is howwe walk.
Can I try?
"No, Quico!"
That's not how you do it.
"You look beautiful, beautiful..."
"Frontwards, backwards, and slide... and a smile for the audience, you look great, perfect!"
I am ready to walk up there with you?
"The tightrope walkers, Márcia and Marcelo!"
- I Love you.
- Me too.
"Barbuda, you look lovely."
Let's get going now.
We go in after the acrobats.
"Foguinho, relax or you'll throw me off."
"Go away, great."
You look wonderful.
"Maria, my love!"
- Can I help you?
- Hi.
Grandma's here to see you.
Give grandma a kiss.
Debra.
There you go.
My brother's tall.
Right?
Are we in trouble or something?
No way.
Gary loves the show.
Pleased with the ratings.
Right.
Of course.
They love us.
Where's Gary?
Gary's dead.
I'm Jack Donaghy.
New VP of development for NBC/GE/Universal/Kmart.
"Oh, we own Kmart now."
No.
So why are you dressed like we do?
I'm surprised you're renovating.
This is such a nice office.
"It's a great office, but sometimes, you have to change things that are perfectly good just to, uh, make them your own."
Please.
"Ah, I'll call her back."
Is she at the White House line?
Great.
Tell them I need a 4:00 a.m. tee off time.
"Uh, five inches, but it's thick."
Are you familiar with the GE Tri-vection Oven?
I don't cook very much.
"Sure, I got you."
"New York, third wave feminist, college educated."

Absolem?
Why are you upside down?
I've come to the end of this life.
-You're going to die?
-Transform.
Don't go.
I need your help.
I don't know what to do.
"I can't help you if you don't even know who you are, stupid girl."
I'm not stupid.
My name is Alice.
I live in London.
I have a mother named Helen and a sister named Margaret.
My father was Charles Kingsleigh.
"He had a vision that stretched halfway around the world, and nothing ever stopped him."
I'm his daughter.
I'm Alice Kingsleigh.
"Alice, at last."
You were just as dim-witted the first time you were here.
"You called it ""Wonderland,"" as I recall."
Wonderland.
(WATCH TICKING)
-What do you call yourself?
-Alice.
The Alice?
"Then I'll take you to the Hare and the Hatter, but that's the end of it."
McTWISP:
She's the right one.
I'm certain of it.
"Ah, Thackery, not at the table, please."
Have some tea.
"You're not Absolem, I'm Absolem, stupid girl."
Kuya!
Wait!
That's just the remains of a previous experiment.
It's not someone you should be fighting.
"Hey, lemme know, if you're gonna be reckless like that!"
No way!
I see...
But remember the Von Dinosaur incident...
Proceed with extreme caution.
"Yes, of course."
"If you'll excuse me, sir."
"Now, we're fully prepared..."
"The world will now see the almighty power of the States, and realize who will lead the world!"
Is it going to take her away?
Cover her!
I won't allow you to take Manami!
Damn...
"Take me, too!"
More to come...

More to come...
No...!
Wh...
What?
Kuya!
You okay?
Yes...
Let's get the hell out of here!
Keep going!
Keep going!
Keep going!
"- Well, well, well!"
You ready for one more ass-whupping?
!
You're going down!
"I will not fight you, Stinkmeaner."
"Say what, nigga?"
!
You not gonna fight?
!
Then why'd you come?
!
"Nigga, you could've told me you's a bitch over the phone!"
I came because I'm not afraid of you!
But I'm tired of acting like a nigga!
I'm an old man.
I'm dignified.
I watch PBS.
All y'all should be ashamed!
This has gone too far!
"Now, I've already called the police, so everyone should just go home!"
"Come on, fight, old man!"
Fight!
"Aw, hey!"
Ruined everything!
"This ain't over, Robert!"
"We got your back, Stinkmeaner!"
- It worked.
- It worked.
Hey!
"Ed Wuncler, my favorite billionaire!"
What can I do for you?
"Well, I heard about your little incident, and I wanted to see if you were okay."
"Oh, wow, complaining."
"That's very interesting, considering nobody invited you."
"Before I came along, you were on a skateboard."
Oh!
Oh!
You like them?
"Yeah, I guess."
"Well, what do you like?"
Everything.
"Well, I don't know."
I don't really listen to music.
"Dude, that's kind of weird."
Why?
What do you like?
"Uh, right now... punk."
"I'm sorry, Avril Lavigne doesn't count as punk."
Oh yeah?
"Well, what about the Cramps?"
Stiff Little Fingers?
The Clash?
Sex Pistols?
I listen to the same music as Marissa Cooper?
I think I have to kill myself.
"Listen to punk, huh?"
I'm angry.
That's it right there.
Looks scary.
"Well, then, you can stay in the car."
"You recognize this place, Ryan?"
This isn't...
Where are we?
"Well, it's one of my mom's housing developments."
"- with $20,000..."
- Wait.
Wait.
"Seriously, wait."
Wait.
Wait.
What if I go and get the watches out of the locker?
No one's looking for me.
We can... we can fence them and then we have the money.
We can do whatever we want.
"We can go wherever we want, right?"
We could change our identities and go to Tallahassee.
So you... you want to steal the watches to help me with get away with stealing the watches?
Yes.
That is exactly what I want to do.
I can't let you risk everything...
I love you.
"I love you, too."
You think you can do it?
I know I can.
You ready?
Yeah.

You leave her alone.
Leave her alone.
Go on!
"Someone at the door, dear."
- We must make up our minds.
- Gentlemen!
- We can't delay.
- Let's do something.
This king's champion must be stopped.
The monster must be protected.
"If he kills the monster, we'll all be ruined."
Let me prevail upon you.
No more argy-bargy is necessary because I have a plan.
Behold!
The Black Knight.
Wonderful!
We must be getting closer.
Grease.

Now that.
Get him.
And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
"Come to my arms, my beamish boy"

- The monster's dead!
The monster's dead!
Stop!
No one's to enter the city unless they have money.
Look how they`ve grown!
"You have lost weight, Catherine!"
She`s added a few more mouths to the litter.
"Rusty and Audrey, cousins Vicki and dale."
And this is Eddie Junior and Junior.
The little one hanging on my skirt is Daisy-MabeI.
"How old are you, little one?"
"She was born without a tongue, clark."
"But, don`t worry about her."
She whistles like a bird and eats like a horse.
Take your little guests out back and show them your worm farm.
"ellen, come in the house."
I`ve got so much to tell you.
Look at that car!
That`s the family Truckster.
"Boy, she`s a beaut!"
I Iike those green walls.
We had some trouble in St. Louis.
You`re looking really fit.
This is the old homestead.
"Yeah, I don`t know for how long, though."
The bank`s been after me like flies on a rib roast.
I know the feeling.
Fuck it!
I bet you could use a cool one?
Now you`re talking.
I`m going steady.
And I French kiss.
So?
Everyone does that.
"Yeah, but Daddy says I`m the best."
Want a worm?
You're late.
The other bidders were hoping you wouldn't show.
I'll be happy to disappoint them.
- Sweetie?
- Yes sir.
- Stay close.
- Thanks.
See you later. 9:00.
Red eleven.
I'm approaching the cabin.
It's 5250.
Angels?
The signal's jammed.
Somebody doesn't want us listening.
Angels?
You're cutting it a little close.
I'm not here for the company.
I'm here to place my bid.
Are you sure your employer's prepared
- ...to compete in the big leagues?
- You'll see.
Welcome.
Business is for tomorrow.
Tonight...
A toast.
To the most beautiful flower in the world.
Salud.
Na zdorovie.
None of you have met my boss...
But he's successful because he's risk-averse.
That's why you all have been drugged.
The first thing to go is muscle control.
- Marco Zuloaga.
- I'll put you through.
- To get a referral slip stamped?
"- Along the corridor, Administration."
- Who is it?
- It's Marco Zuloaga.
I'm calling from Jordan.
I read that Lydia died.
"Yes, that's right."
"I'm so sorry, Marco."
I would like to have been told.
We've had so many problems here.
What's going on?
They said Benigno doesn't work there anymore.
Benigno's in jail.
In jail?
Why?
He's accused of raping Alicia.
What are you talking about?
Try to help him.
The poor guy's got nobody.
- Have you been to see him?
- Me?
"After what he's done, I can't."
But he needs help and you're his friend.
- All right.
What jail is he in?
- It's in Segovia.
"Wait here for me, please."
I'd like to see an inmate.
"That's in Visitations, through that door to the left."
Thank you.
Good night.
I see...
So this is the lowest layer.
"You say the two of them are here, right?"
Yes.
What shall we do?
This wasn't mentioned in Fubuki's report.
"Have Jinpu, Usyuki and one more stay behind to guard, and the rest of you, go down to the lowest layer."
Damn you!
This is special agent Fubuki.
The two Dangaioh pilots are in my custody.
"Boy, I'm in trouble now."
Wake up.
Both of you wake up!
"Are you okay, Big Brother?"
Kaori...
Hurry and get out there!

What on earth happened?
I'll explain later.
Just hurry!
"Hitomi, hang in there!"

"- I'm just having fun, that's all!"
"You get dressed up to do a bit of shopping, not to be knocked over by an errand boy!"
"Of course not, Mrs Featherstone."
"Come and sit here, my dear."
Take the weight off your purse.
Not even me husband used to get as close as that!
Whereabouts did you catch her?
I don't know.
Everything went black.
She's a widow woman.
Everything's black to start with!
"God, it could have been anywhere!"
"Hey, come on, you're supposed to be customer--finding."
Get out there.
Go on!
"Dear, dear!"
"You look sad, Granville."
You poor love!
What is it?
It's advanced training.
"Oh, if it's only to do with the shop!"
I thought you were really depressed -- heartache or something.
That's what I mean.
[PHONE BEEPING]
NATE:
It's already been over an hour.

Gossip Girl?
You crazy?
"- Dan, what are you doing here?"
- I Loopt you.
Are you waiting for Gossip Girl?
"Yeah, and I know you don't approve."
I'm gonna go close the tab.
"This grudge-match thing, it doesn't seem like you."
What's going on?
- I don't wanna be irrelevant.
- Irrelevant?
You're Serena van der Woodsen.
"Gossip Girl might be right about me, but she's wrong about you."
"Without Serena, who would I have dreamt about?"
I might have spent my whole life on the outside if you hadn't let me in.
Which I'm holding against you.
[LAUGHS]
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
"Oh, my God."
"Oh, that makes sense."
"- Wait, they're a team."
- A team of what?
"- Wait, why are you all here?"
- I got a text saying to meet you.
- Will you be at this Lenai Street address?
- Yes.
No.
She'll be at Robin Masters' estate with me.
I will be staying at my own house.
You can reach her at the estate or through Rick at the club.
You can reach me at my own house.
Won't you be more comfortable at Robin's Nest until your relatives arrive from the mainland?
OK.
"Mrs Greenberg, one last thing."
If you think of anything else...
- I will call you!
- Fine.
Thank you.
They make me so nervous.
"Now, why do I have to stay at this Robin's Nest?"
- Why does she have to stay there?
- Because they might try and grab her.
They don't want me.
They want Saul.
They don't want her.
They want Saul.
- You know who's got Saul?
- No.
Mrs Greenberg?
'Dr Haywood to paediatrics.'
Sorry you had to wait.
I was in surgery.
I'm Dr Kessler.
You are not my husband's doctor.
Are you Saul Greenberg's doctor?
- Yes.
"Leslie Davison was Emma's donor, correct?"
How did you get that information?
She has something to do with the murders.
"Yeah, Leslie Davison is the donor."
Emma's with her mother right now.
Someone who said he was her lawyer... gave me the address.
"Leslie, put it on."
You're so beautiful.

"Good morning, my lovely."
"Not now, Ponch."
Sarge needs these reports.
Saturday night they got a great double bill at the drive-in.
Some of us stopped going to drive-ins when we graduated from high school.
- Accurately you calculate your gas...
"This is a drive-in movie and a picnic, all in one date."
- It's really far-out.
- Poncherello.
"Think it over, I make a terrific potato salad."
Ponch.

"Yeah, let's celebrate."
Let's get back to the campground.
Far out.
Today has got to be our day.
"Hey, come on, let's go."
It's almost time.
Yeah.
For what?
Lunch?
No.
Chicken place?
What's that?
That's where they serve young boys to perverts.
I wouldn't do what they wanted.
So they tied me to the bed...
And took a soldering iron...
I'm sorry.
"Listen, let's get outta here, eh?"
You don't belong here.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Nobody's gonna hurt you again.
[Grinding]
[Locks clicking]

Open the door.
I can't.

You all right?
"- Yeah, I'm all right."
"Let yourself in, will you?"
What happened?
That crazy kid.
She locked me up with my own cuffs.
- Where's the keys?

Hi there.
Anybody hurt in this wreck?

Your scrapbook is like you.

- Did you get the warrants?
- Yeah.
I also got two feds.
Mulderig and Klein.
What do we need those pricks for?
"Because our department's got about 908 bucks to make buys,... ..and they can get all they want from Uncle Sap."
Hello.
"These yours, darling?"
Oh.
Hey Lola.
Yes!
Yes!
Finally!
Somebody knows Lola!
I always liked him.
All right bye.
This is awesome.
Now you can be back in the band and we can be together all the time.
Ooh.
Just one simple rule.
Just 'cause you're mushy on Miley.
Don't mean you can be huggy on Hannah.
What?
"Come on, I can't have the world thinking that Hannah steals."
A boyfriend even though she wouldn't be stealing.
Her boyfriend 'cause my boyfriend is her boyfriend.
Which brings me right back to... what?
"You're dating Miley, not Hannah."
Got it.
You just tell me which one to kiss.
This one.
Okay the two minute kissing window is now closed.
-Dad.
-Come on Mr. Stewart.
[Grunting] Look at this Jesse.
Your horoscope says.
You are dangerously close to a slow painful death.
Now come on get the TV on.
It's time for the monkey to drive.
When you ask do you wanna dance.
It's like renting' a video.
"Once you're finished with it, you just pop it back through the slot."
I've got a new baby lined up.
"Oh, aye?"
One of me own.
- You what?
- Yeah.
- You're not pregnant?
- Yeah.
- Aren't we?
- Mm.
Bloody hell.
Aren't you gonna congratulate us?
"Aye, yeah."
"I'll crack open a bottle of Ribena Toothkind, shall I?"
We're gonna envelope together.
How are you gonna support yourselves?
The money from two paper rounds don't go far.

Crash Bang Wallop.
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

"- Yeah, for me sins."
Felix.
As you wish.
See you in three months.
Then.
Yes.
I'll call you.
Thank you.
Kevin.
Hello.
Hello.
I apologize for this morning.
You weren't so formal this morning.
I shouldn't have said all that.
What?
- Everything I said.
No.
It was...
A learning experience.
Do you always judge people like that.
from the start?
In five minutes.
You understand it all?
It's more complicated than that.
Sometimes.
I talk to someone.
and feel as if I were inside them.
watching them from inside.
As if there was a bond between us.
You didn't expect me to call?
No.
You said you were suspicious of me.
that you were afraid to call.
I had good reasons to be suspicious.
"I have the patent for the helicopter,"
I did the chief scout for five years
And I can stand under water for three minutes.
I see that Belgium's suffering is the least of her worries.
"Strength, enough with the suffering of Belgium."
Let's go.
"Mr. Lloyd, just wait."
Let's go.
"What do you think, Ludovic?"
Do you have any suggestions?
"No, that's fine, sire."
Link heaven to the present situation of our country...
It's a good comparison.
It's not too much...
How are you saying that?
Go on?
- Sure.
"Louise, who's the lucky one?"
- Sorry?
The ring.
"If you really want to know it, it's Pierre-Armand."
Let me guess.
"French and you've known studying law, right?"
Did you dig into my past?
"- It's all online, baby."
Tell me about Pierre-Antoine.
- Pierre-Armand.
"And I'm not his treasure, Mr. Loyd."
- Call me Duncan.
Me dia.
"Hey, stop."
We have to go to Sofia.
[CROWD CHUCKLING]
"Oh, what a beautiful dog."
"Seriously, Devon, I really did feel just a moment, a splash, of hesitation."
"No, there wasn't."
There wasn't any hesitation at all.
PAIGE:
You just did it again.
That was a pause.
DEVON:
I did not pause.
You must be Beth.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Heard a lot about you from Paige.
Actually been lobbying to sit next to her single sister for weeks.
"Oh, yeah?"
So you must be:
"""Dan."""
Sort of.
- Sort of?
"- Well, I'm actually a Wiccan."
- A what?
- A Wiccan.
Wiccan?
- Male witch.
- Right.
So I also have a magical name.
It's Brother Phoenix East-Horse.
But I didn't know if that would fit on the card.
Love that.
I'm guessing that I'm gonna hear a whole lot about you.
"Nature-based pre-Christian paganism, yeah."
Miss Elizabeth Dollon.
Ah!
Let her in.
She comes from Switzerland.
"Sir, where is my brother?"
"Miss, I beg you, rest easy."
He was arrested but it probably was a mistake.
"I know, but it is terrible."
"You know, Miss, what would be truly terrible is that he was really guilty."
Why did you not free him?
He has therefore not been able to defend himself?
"On the contrary, Miss."
H defended himself.
And where is he now?
Can I see him?
Listen...
I would rather...
I mean...
I fear that seeing him
You're hiding something.
"I want to see him, you hear me?"
"He's dead, isn't he?"
"Alas, Mss."
"No, it is not possible."
This is not true.
He was killed?
"Listen, lead me to him."
You can not refuse me.
It's too horrible.
"I beg you, calm down."
I'll take you to your brother.
Your brother was innocent.
"Hey, I wanna meet him."""
"And Kat's like, ""All right, I'll go introduce you."
"Come on."""
"- Oh, my gosh."
- I never met him either.
Andy was talking to somebody and then Kat goes:
"- ""Andy, this is Ari."""
"- Oh, man, that is so funny."
- Great.
- I couldn't help it.
"This is at The Box, which is an amazing space."
This was amazing.
This was...
Yes.
Yes.
- This was a really fun day.
- They did that how many times?
Like 10?
"Upwards of 10 probably, right?"
- Yeah.
- This is one of my favorite days.
"We're all, like, hanging out in there."
- My parents were here this day.
"- Yeah, your parents were there."
I love everybody's different faces.
Look at this.
Bewildered.
"This was originally slow motion, right?"
Or I guess we shot it regular.
"It was, but we realized the song wasn't long enough for us to play it in slow motion."
- Right.
"Oh, man."
I'll wait.
It's okay.
"Just tell me anytime, I just wanted to give it to you now just in case..."
No.
No?
"I can't wait to tell you yes, I'll marry you."
Load it 300 okay?
.
Thank you!
-Just there in the other block.
-I'll ask permission first.
"-Hello, Grandma!"
"-That's why be good my dear, okay?"
"But of course Grandma, I'm being a good girl!"
-You can even ask sister...
-You're such a joker!
"Hello Grandma, of course I should still be your prettiest and your favorite granddaughter!"
"Oh my, my granddaughter is really clever."
So how are you my dear?
What made you call?
"Well, there's something I'd like to ask your permission for."
I'm getting married.
Really?
Is it to your boyfriend who's a doctor?
.
"Yes Grandma, to Migs!"
Our wedding will be on June 1 0.
-Oh my I'm excited!
-You know what Grandma?
I love Migs so much.
And I know he'll take care of me.
"Come on, my dear."
You'll call her first thing?
Thanks.
Bye.
- Walter can't represent me on this.
- Why not?
Because it's criminal.
I don't understand why they want to talk to you.
"I told you, I don't know why."
"- Rick, I'm not the enemy."
- l'm sorry.
It's just I don't know what's happening and I suspect that Karen does.
- Karen is behind this?
- She wouldn't tell me.
Maybe she wasn't allowed to.
Miles?
"It's Rick, again."
"Uh, call me as soon as you get this."
It doesn't matter what time.
"Rick, it's okay."
"Rick, come here."
Please?
I know this is going to be okay.
I know who you are.
I know how you conduct yourself.
"Whatever these people may have done, it doesn't concern you."
"Hello, Rick?"
Hi.
Stephanie Arlyn.
I'm sorry.
We were wrapping up a deposition.
That's okay.
"- This is my associate, James Davis."
What the-- this isn't the-- you've got to get over here.
"This isn't the-- the camera's looking at us, right?"
This isn't the fucking hospital.
"Aw, shite."
"This-- you know, this isn't the fucking hospital."
Do it like-

HEIDI SJURSEN:
I told my mom this morning
That I was gonna be making out with a chick today.
What did she say?
[Laughs] My mom's so cool.
"Like, she didn't flip."
"She was like, really?"
"Like OK, honey, have a good time."
"Yeah, have a good time."
Did everything work out yesterday
With the Sapphic love scene?
No.
"Why, what happened?"
There was a revolution.
The actress did not wish to take her clothes off.
"And, you know, and she did the first scene"
Don't you?
Or do you just beat them until they do it?
Agreed.
But only until Casa Antigua.
Good.
We march in an hour.
We must hurry.
The French colonel will send the scouts after us at dawn.
How do you know it's a colonel?
Why not a captain?
Or a major?
Unless you watched us yesterday.
Watched us die and did nothing.
I'm sorry.
So am I.
"Now, listen."
I'm in charge here.
"Not them, not Harper."
I'm in command.
You follow me.
"Speak French, Harris?"
"Oui, certainement, je parle..."
That'll do.
I want two boards and some pitch.
"Hagman, I want a lantern, a pound of gunpowder and a pound of old iron."
"Cooper, go on sentry."
"- And, Perkins..."
- Sir?
Dig a proper grave for Captain Murray.
"Yes, sir."
- Out!
- That box on the horse.
No.
Not as far as I know.
Why?
I don't know.
He's just weird.
He's my brother.
Don't worry.
He's just a half brother.
Then I just half embarrassed myself.
Mr. Pedro Paulo's office.
It's Sharon.
"Sharon, the intern."
"Hello, who is this?"
Since when do you have an intern?
Jealous?
Me?
Jealous?
Are you mad?
I'll be right with you.
Take a seat.
I just called to check something.
I'm filling out a questionnaire in a magazine.
Did you ever make number two in front of me?
What?
Number two.
"You know, in the bathroom."
Poop?
"No, of course not."
I knew it.
Thanks for clearing that up.
Good-bye.
Seven years of marriage... and we never made number two in front of one another.
You'll never have to do another one...
Promise?

"Ready, number 4..."
Ready?
I'm just caught up in another of her spells.
"Well, she's turning me into someone else."
Everyday i hope and pray this will end.
"But when I can, I do it all again."
And if she says:
"come inside, i'll come inside for her."
And if she says:
"give it all, i'll give everything to her."
I am justified.
I am purified.
"I am sanctified, inside you..."
I am justified.
I am purified.
I am sanctified.
inside you...
Are you ready ?
Yeah...
Yeah...
This is the first day of my last days.

"Amber, where are you going?"
It don't matter where I'm going.
What's important is that you won't be there.
You think I'm gonna just let you leave with my baby?
It ain't your choice.
I don't need your permission.
- Shit.
- I especially don't need your money.
Can you move?
And you know what?
"I damn sure don't need them damn flowers, so you can send those back to one of your other randoms."
You can't do this.
"Yes, me, too."
- Let's go over that side.
- Good.
Let's do it here.

Just let me know if I can be of service.
No thanks.
You're not the Marshal.
I can easily handle this.
I've got all the masked opera singers here!
But who is the murderer?
Shut up!
Speak up!

You once picked a fight with your reflection after two.
Is there more?
"No, that's it."
"""sincerely, Frankie and Mike Heck."""
What?

Why would you sign my name?

'cause this is your fault!
You got me all pumped up by supporting me!
That's what husbands do!
"Wives say they're gonna do stuff,"
And we listen and nod.
Right.
That's being supportive.
Cut it out!
"What are you, his mom?"
Have a good weekend.
I brought you a CD forthe trip.

You can't understand them.
Chicco's sleeping!

Hey.
He's awake.
You might see a bit blurry.
"It's just your depth perception trying to calibrated, yeah?"
"Follow me as I walk, yeah?"
Get up.
Okay.
Alright.
Now.
Can you focus only over here?
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Burying you is like burying treasure.
I really don't understand what Akan's think because...
"Henry, stop kicking around."
"You're almost there, mate."
Here's where you gotta get to.

"I put my name in for seven songs, so I'll be back up here again."
"- Uh, yes."

"Honestly, you're like a crazy person."
"Okay, I'm not crazy."
"It's just been a crazy week, Anders."
Okay?
Okay.
Brent Hoffman died.

Sure.

Maybe we're chasing after something that doesn't even exist.
Has anyone ever told you to stick to your first instinct?
I've heard it once or twice.

- GEORGE:
Mallefille!
No!
"Very well, monsieur."
I will give you the opportunity.
But not the prize.
Let's go back.
This is ridiculous.
"What, run for my hole like a rabbit?"

"Nor could you, Aurora."
I'm going to fight at dawn for the right to see another dawn.

He's in love.
Monsieur.
Madame.

Please.
I wonder...
Is there by any chance a cleaner one?
- Don't hurt him.

"Regardless it is a robbery or murder,"
I want to find the guy who did it.

She's not black.
Black?
Churchill wasn't black.
"Look, look, look,"
I gave you £75.
You put it in there.
What do you mean by telling me you called the police?
You've done no such thing.
Your wife's just told me you're still searching the rooms.
"Well, I thought she'd called them."
You lying hound!
- Mrs. Richards...
"- Go and call them now, immediately."
"Mrs. Richards, we will, the moment we've searched..."
Right.
I shall call them myself then.
Couldn't we just wait until...

What are you doing coming to the front door?
It was a better way to meet than her tripping over me behind the furnace.
"Yeah, but just knocking on the door?"
Why couldn't you ask me?
- You would have said no?
- My mom thinks you're trouble.
- You don't like her boyfriend.
- He's not her boyfriend.
He's a customer at the bank.

I don't remember.
It's better that way.
- Why?
What happened?
Repeated convulsions that lasted about fifteen minutes.
Your heart made it.
Then the ambulance brought you here.
I gave you narcotics and neuroleptics.
What?
You touched me?
I was wearing gloves.
Yes.
But you were near me?
How did I get here?
Listen.
Mr Thomas.
you had severe allergic reactions.
I don't want to shake you up.
I want to know the truth.
Did you bring me here?
You came into my home?
What about the alarms?
The insurance cut them off.
Yes.
"In the Paratroopers, I mean."
I don't know.
I guess I wanted to get knocked off or something.
But as soon as I got away from my mother... I suddenly realized how wonderful life really was!
And then I fought like a tiger to stay alive!
I was running away from problems.
You know what I mean.
"Yeah, I know."
"Something's bothering you, isn't it?"
Yeah...
Can I help?
"No, you can't."
Better not to talk about it.
All right.
"-Hey, have you had dinner?"
-No.
-Would you like dinner with me?
-Okay!
All right.
Doc Swain?
"Evening, Selena."
I'll be right with you.
My wife loved these flower gardens.
I try to keep them up for her.
"Ah, watch your feet."
Are you going to tell them about me?
"-I'll have to, Selena."
-Nobody in town must ever know.
"But, if I don't, you'll be risking your life."
-I know that.
"-Well, then, why?"
-Because of Ted.
- Just a minute.
alberto?
"Now I can leave, my best to yourIover."
- What lover?
.
- AII yourIies!
"It's my fault, but I didn't do it on purpose!"
"Scapece was yelling, but I couldn't understand!"
Stay back.
Be careful.
If I asked you to marry me?
No rush.
Rememberwhen we got married?
"We lived everywhere, we didn't give a damn."
We were happy because we were together.
How could we have forgotten that?
Jackass.
Come in.
What is it?
It's foryou.
From the central Office.
"Two years have gone by, it was bound to come."
So?
milan.
"You're happy, aren't you?"
See you tonight.
Have a good trip.
"It's always the same with you directors, you come, we get used to you, when everything's workin' smooth, you run off like thieves."
Goodbye.
Mamma's boy!
This is foryou.
There you go.
- Yeah?
- Yes.
Let's go.
"You really don't believe that we have met before, right?"
Not at all.
But this bloody thing...
believes in everything you say.
This understands that just to save my life you agreed to marry a joker.
I don't know about your past life.
But in this life...
I love you so much that I can handle ten such villains for you.
Look!
Look!
Look!
There's another one!
Lovejoy's love rain.
What happened?
Full moon?
What...?
- Let's go.
- Where?
Hurry up!
Where are you taking me?
"""A girl completely drenched."""
"""Sleepless in a sleepy night."""
"""She met a stranger."""
"""I am the one in the past."
"I am the one in the present."""
"""Tell me...."""
"""This is a fact!"""
Good evening.
"If your adventure trip is over, shall we leave?"
"And ""druid's noch""?"
A period landmark.
The location of the astronomicon.
"I'll call karen,"
Then we'll be off.
After we find andreas.
You mean rescue him from the gural nataz?
(karen:) hello?
Huh?
"Karen, nigel."
"Yeah, I need you to look up a site."
It's called the druid's noch.
Circa 70 a.D.
This all seems so strange:
You helping to rescue my son.
"Yeah, well don't read"
"Too much into it, da veiga."
It's you he needs saving from.
"Thanks, karen."
"Okay, she's on it."
I have to go.
"Here, take this with you."
"Sydney, we may need that."
We don't have that luxury.
He could trade it for andreas.
"Because that's what you do, isn't it?"
"Trade, steal..."
"When I show this to the gural nataz,"
They will decipher the code
"Just as you have done,"
And then they will send out more agents.
You have to find the astronomicons
I want her to be able to learn
- how to solve problems on her own.
- Yeah.
"I thought you guys were, like, super old and gross or whatever, but you're actually, like, really cool aunts and uncle or whatever."
Thanks or whatever.
He dumped me.
- What?
- What?
W-What'd he do that for?
He said I was suffocating him.
I can't believe you guys made me talk to my boyfriend.
You ruined my life!
And mine!
SAMANTHA:
God!
- JEN:
Um...
- JENNA:
Let's get piercings.
Do you understand anything that just happened?
Yeah.
Teenagers are crazy.
"I mean, I think we got it wrong."
"Like, babies are not the hard part."
That is the hard part.
But we'll get through it.
- Yeah. (sighs)
- Mm-hmm.
We just gotta put our thinking caps on.
"Okay, just get the hat, Greg."
"Oh, yeah."
They still got it!
- This is not the time.
- It's the perfect time.
"Truth, Gemma."
- I love you.
"- Oh, shit, Chris."
Give me another chance.
You know you want to.
No!
Sorry.
"Serious buzzkill, Chris."
"- I say the moment's passed, mate."
- Yeah.
I choose truth.
- Felix isn't in Chile.
- So... where is he?
"Well, what happened was that he hung himself."
What?
He hung himself.
"Right here, from that crossbeam there."
"- Is this a joke, mate?"
"- No joke, mate."
It's what happened.
I'm in Afghanistan stewing in sweat and fear and blood.
"And when I get home, my kid brother's found swinging from the rafters."
The groundsman cut him down.
True story.
But this is terrible.
"It's been hushed up, naturally, 16 generations of French Catholics."
"Suicide's about as shameful as it gets, not to menton a faggot cop-out."
So why are we here?
I need to get the bottom of it.
Family honour's at stake.
I know the risk but I have to know her.
Elena.
She's a dead ringer for Katherine.
"- Anna, your face."
- It's nothing.
It didn't look like nothing.
- Matty tells me you broke his heart.
- Mom.
He found his rebound girl.
There's a tomb under the church.
You saved everyone in the church?
"Twenty-seven vampires, Damon."
You can't just bring them back.
It's Harper.
I'm glad you found us.
"Annabelle, close the door, please."
"Hey, Bethanne."
What are you guys watching?
You've been watching the same thing the whole time?
There are over 150 channels.
It's called a remote control.
This button changes the channel.
Hold it like this.
- Mm.
"Did you get enough, sweetheart?"
- For now.
"Anna, are you hungry?"
Did you want a little?
"No, thank you, Miss Gibbons."
Why don't you lay down and get some rest?
She's fine.
"Aren't you, Miss Gibbons?"
"Yeah, actually, Gibbs..."
No.
That's it.
Thanks.
We should have told Gibbs.
Later.
"Come on, McGee, answer."
Aren't you gonna get that?
Yes?
Don't tell Gibbs it's me.
Okay.
Yes?
The air marshal I mentioned before--
I need you to dig up anything you can on him.
Name is Mike Beers.
"Well, that could take a while."
TSA personnel files are always tightly wrapped.
What's this about?
Bishop knows the guy from somewhere.
She's trying to figure out why.
"Soon as you can, McGee."
Yeah.
Don't look at me.
Just do it.
Is everything okay?
What took so long?
"The air marshal, where'd he go?"
"He's, um... the charging station."
"What was that about, Tony?"
Nothing I'm gonna tell Gibbs until we're sure about this guy.
Sure about what?
"Well, that joke I told back there."
Second one's almost there.
- Cool.
- And this device I invented... will monitor the vibrations of the audience.
- That's great.
- Just keep the music coming... from the baddest jazz trio in D.C.!
And I got some women lined up for you.
"Michael, I told you."
I don't want to meet anybody.
"Come on, Jeff."
You got to get over Stacy.
It's been four months since you broke up.
"You got to move on, experience life."
- You're right.
"- Anyway, first show..."
Debra's bringing her cousin Denise.
"She's kind of fat, but she's got a cute face."
"Cool, cool."
"Second, Anita's bringing her girl."
Says she's a ten.
- A ten?
- Uh-huh.
"Without a weave, she's a six."
That's cool.
I got to go.
Warden.
Just appease her.
"With this baby here, you won't be here much longer."
"Move over, Wynton Marsalis."
Cool.
"Aren't you going to say excuse me, Dre?"
Excuse me.
"Thanks again for calling, Mr. Reed."
Just army.
"Why are you here, Harper?"
You boneheaded Paddy!
So...
"The Chosen Men, eh?"
Well...
I didn't choose you.
But remember this
I know you all i've always known you you and your kind all my life
All I know is how to fight.
"So if there's any man amongst you expecting a quick ramble through this war, now's the time."
Be sure now.
Right.
Join the column.
"At the double, left face!"
Trail arms!
Quick march!
Halt!
"Company, halt!"
"It's that way, sir."
We'll wait for dawn.
Sergeant Williams!
Sir!
- We'll make camp now.
- Sir!
"All right, lads, make camp."
"Fletcher, Jones, Edwards - fetch firewood."
Morris and Brown - sentries.
Column dismissed!
Not you Sharpe
Take your men up that slope and see what the terrain is like for tomorrow.
"Well, you heard him."
Come on.
Prepare the Jabberwocky for battle.
We're going to visit my little sister.
I had hoped to have a champion by now.
Why don't you slay the Jabberwocky yourself?
You must have the power.
It is against my vows to harm any living creature.
(SPUTTERING)
We have company.
"Have a look, Bayard."
BAYARD:
Bielle.
(BARKING)
I'm so happy to see you.
I thought they were going to...
So did I.
"But they didn't, and now here I am, still in one piece."
And I'm rather glad about that now that I'm seeing you again.
"I would have regretted not seeing you again, especially now that you're you, and the proper size."
And it's a good size.
It's a great size.
It's a right proper Alice size!
-Hatter.
-Size.
Fez.
I'm fine.
Where's your hat?
Mmm.
-Cheshire.
"-How's the arm, love?"
All healed.
"Goodbye, sweet hat."
Why can't you compromise on something?
Anything?
Because then I'd be you.
A real Hollywood agent.
"I want to look like that French girl in ""Last Tango in Paris."" Oh."
Where are my heels?
"She had that hat, remember?"
It's black with the flower?
Clothes are not what I remember about that movie.
What?
You're nervous.
[scoffs] [laughs] It's cute.
You're cute.
Just cleaning my boots.
[sighs] [brush swiping]
"Do you love me, Nick?"
[laughs softly]
I wouldn't want to be on this ride with anyone else.

I can't wait until our trip to Merced this weekend.
What's happening?
Deep breaths.
What are you doing?
Giving you the chance to prove that Pure Bloods aren't immortal.
"Pure Bloods could die, and that we, the infected ones, will be the ones to take you all down."
I...
I...
I thought you loved me.
I do.
For everything you've just done for Marcus and I.
Who is infected now?
"I know it hurts, mom."
- Please don't!
- I can't.
Stop it you bitch!
It has to work right?
Tell me it's gonna work!
I'm so thristy!
"I can smell him, he's right there."
"I'm so thirsty, honey, please!"
Why isn't this working?
"She's fed to many times, she's been turned for too long."
Let me out!
What can I do?
You can let me do it.
Mom!

I'm sorry.

You ever get your hands dirty?
"If you need anything, then..."
just ask.
Morning.
I've come for Peter.
He's my son.
You want it.
Yeah.
Why can't you get better for me?
We had so much and it's all fucked up forever.
I'm so lonely.
I know.
Do you remember when you rode with me in the ambulance after I tried to kill myself?
Of course.
That's what love feels like.
What are you doing?
Lovely Sid and lovely Michelle are fucking.
We're not...
Not in the way you're thinking.
Effy?
What's wrong?
It keeps happening.
OK.
Lie down.
- Do you mind?
- No.
"I like this story, anyway."
Thanks.
"""Orpheus was the greatest poet who ever lived."

"Yeah, the guy in Cleveland."
What about him?
He's the district attorney there.
"All right, we'll handle it."
Anything else?
The last name.
It's gotta be done on Friday.
That's the 13th.
Friday the 13th.
It'll be done the following day.
Some of the boys think it's bad luck to take a contract for the 13th.
We can't push our luck.
"Sorry I can't ask you to stay, Lew."
Gotta get dressed for a dinner.
"Next time, for sure."
Hi.
Come on in.
"I'm Lynn Harper, Mr. Gordon."
Thanks for coming.
I wanted to welcome my new neighbours.
I'm glad you believe in being neighbourly.
Always.
"Come, I'll introduce you to my husband and his brother."
Then we'll have dinner.
Lead the way.
Open the valve.
"Excellent dinner, Mrs. Harper."
Everything was delicious.
Thank you.
And it's Lynn.
"I understand you're in the lumber business, Mr. Gordon."
But you and your boy the only ones to walk out alive.
Kind of a miracle.
HENRY:
"Shut up, Fitzgerald."
FITZGERALD:
Is that what you did?
Shot one of your own to save this little dog here?
Why?
"Was he playing with this little boy's mama, huh?"
Did he kill her?
"Hey, you can quit polishing that rifle when I'm talking to you."
I'm working on it.
You can work on it when I'm done talking to you.
Look at me.
HENRY:
That's enough!
"You're forgetting your place, boy."
"As far as I can tell, my place is here on the smart end of this rifle."
HENRY:
"You move along, Fitzgerald."
That's an order!
Listen!
There's only a couple hours of light left.
We got to stash these pelts and get rid of the boat.
Let's go!

"Greetings, Mr. Adda!"
"You're in big trouble, mister."
- No.
"Oh, God."
- Yup.
- You're gonna have to pay for it.
"- I told them, Officer."
"I said it was stupid at the start, but nobody listened to me."
That's good.
Remorse.
Nice candy.
"'Cause, for starters, we're looking at three big ones."
"Oh, God!"
Three big
- Three years?
Three hundred dollars.
What?
For the windshield.
"Plus, there's this little baby right here."
"You'll have to put that together with tape, but it still counts."
- This-
- This is a ticket.
- Yeah.
For operating a class-two vehicle without a license.
Weight class two.
Can't this wait?
Mr. Richards is suffering from a concussion.
- We're talking.

My pen ran out of ink.

- Getting ready for the theater.
Theater?
Sure.
It's Laura's opening night.
- I forgot.
- You promised to come.
"Yeah, but..."
- I couldn't stand it tonight.
- Why not?
I had my share of amateur dramatics today.
You're mean.
It's supposed to be really good this time.
Can't we lie in bed and watch TV instead?
How original.
"""A Streetcar Named Desire""..."
perhaps it's on TV tonight.
Vivian Leigh instead of Laura Kirsch.
"Marco, I have to go, and I want to."
- You can come here and watch TV.
- Yeah?
"Yes, I'll tell Laura you're ill."
Yeah?
"Yeah, see you soon."
"My God, they're full to bursting."
Look at my figure.
Look at my figure.

You're his kin.
"People would keep coming in, 'cause they associate you with your old man."
Maybe you should hang with las viejas on 190th.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Doctor says you're getting out of here soon.
They set you up with a daytime nurse for a couple of months.
I spoke to the insurance lady.
I put a little extra in to get you through the next few weeks.
- Gracias.
"- You've got a real gift, Carlos."
Don't let go of that.
"- Put me down, carajo!"
- I got you.
"- Put me down, coño!"
- I got you.
Nice!
Let's get some light in here.
"Better, right?"
"You have some nice plants here, Mr. Eddie."
Let me knot it for you.
They could use some water.
Let's take this jug.
Carlos:
"Turn it, dude."
You're gonna break the window.
- Mickey:
Stop fucking bitching.
- Carlos:
What did I tell you?
- Daisy:
You'll hit the walls.
- Shit.
"Hello, Goni."
I smell that wonderful soup of yours.
Gonki!
We're eating!
"I'm sorry, my darling."
How was your meeting with Alex?
Where did you meet?
At the theater cafe.
- And?
He asked me to direct a small insignificant play.
Do you know it?
"I know the playwright, that's enough."
I don't want to play anymore.
I hate that piano.
Why are you picking on the piano?
You don't have to practice if you don't want to.
"Still, he asked you to direct."
Yes.
In the basement hall.
That playwright is a disgrace.
Delicious.
Daddy made us such good soup.
"Gonki Galonki, why aren't you eating?"
Taste the soup.
I made you soup!
Did you see the doctor?
- Tomorrow.
I thought it was today.
You were wrong.
I'll pour Gonki Galonki some lemonade.
Now try the soup and tell me if it's good.
"Are you sick, Mommy?"
"- Robin, how could you?"
"No, she's right."
Maggie deserves some time to herself.
"Nobody likes to be alone, especially after a breakup, but that's when we discover who we really are and what we really want."
She deserves that.

"And kids, I meant that."
Which is why I'm not proud of what happened next.
It's around the corner.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
(MEN GROANING)
Hey.
"Maggie, sorry."
Class ran a little...
- Who's this?
- (CHUCKLES) This is Adam.
And it's so crazy.
We grew up next door to each other.
"God, we haven't seen each other since..."
- (LAUGHS) A long time.
- (LAUGHS) Yeah.
OLDER TED:
And then Maggie Wilks told us the second-greatest love story I've ever heard.
(ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING)
I just moved to town and I had to look her up.
(MAGGIE LAUGHS)
I guess we've got a lot of catching up to do.
Yeah.
"Yeah, of course."
OLDER TED:
"So, kids, I missed out on the ultimate girl next door to the guy next door."
"Well, see you next time."
GIGGLING
GIRL GIGGLES
"I'm sorry, I..."
Wait.
Please!
I'm Adam.
Patricia.
You must be his friend.
You must be his son.
"Come in, then."
Can I get your opinion on something?
What's wrong with this picture?
You want me to say she looks fat?
Would you say she looks at ease?
She's smiling.
You think?
I'd say that was a smile.
She's uncomfortable.
Self-conscious.
"Then, why did she do it?"
I'll call you.
HE SIGHS
I should...be getting back to work.
"So, what is it that you do, Patricia?"
I'm a journalist.
"Oh, so you work together."
"He really hasn't told you anything about me, has he?"
"I bet he hasn't talked about me much, either."
So we should be equally insulted.
"Well, maybe he's being cautious."
You've been seeing each other for over a year now.
Then he has told you something?
That's what I just said.
"Where did he get it, right here?"
So why are we here?
Johnny Cannata and Frank Doss own this hotel.
Why would they kill a comic?
I don't think they did.
FBI has had them under surveillance.
"Price was involved with Cannata and Doss, very tight."
Silent partner?
We don't know.
Let's go nose around.
How was fishing?
Rainy.
Hi.
Someday I'm gonna be wearing threads like that.
Mrs. Noogman.
"Yeah, definitely his better half."
Where's Miami's favorite mouth?
I don't care.
I got an agent.
I'm a singer now.
I ran into Annie downstairs.
Said she saw a cocktail waitress named Dorothy Bain... head up here with Morty Price about 4:00 this morning.
What's your connection with Miss Bain?
We're acquainted.
"She's a sweet kid, Sonny."
You'd like her.
She's got a cute little boy.
Yeah.
I'd like to meet her.
You know where we can find her?
My lips are sealed.
"Well, open the door!"
Okay.
"Hi, Wilbur, how are you?"
I'm in no mood to get engaged today.
"Do you feel all right, Wilbur?"
I'm fine.
"What's on your mind, baby?"
"Well, Mrs. Brendan wanted to see you in her office right away."
Why?
She didn't say.
I'll walk back with you if you want me to.
"Okay, but no swans."
No swans.
Get my coat!
"Sure, sure."
Skeets!
Yes?
(WHISTLING)
Nothin'.
Wilbur's a very remarkable boy.
"In this day and age, it's so difficult to rear a child properly."
Yes.
I wouldn't give you 10-to-1 on a boy like Wilbur living to grow up.
"Oh, that's a little on the pessimistic side, Mr. Hoolick."
"All right, I'll make it 8-to-1."
"Oh, really."
"Here he is, Mrs. Brendan."
"Hello, Mrs. Brendan, did you want to... (STUTTERING)"
Surprised?
Of course he is.
I've had a hard time catching up with Wilbur.
Now you have him back safe and sound.
- He'll be fine.
- Jackass!
- Stop calling him that.
- Climbing in places like that?
- He got a good person killed!
- It was an accident.
Peter... a cop died!
There was no intention.
"In fact, he tried to stop her."
You're defending him.
He was just trespassing.
It was a sad and tragic accident.
I think you're minimizing just a little.
I have to get to work.
Can we talk about this later?
- Or we could not talk about it at all.
- Mel...
No.
I'm just surprised you feel that way.
"Alright, buddy, much as I love spending time with you, where the hell is this bar?"
Where is Natasha?
Um...
She works at this bar...
She works...
"The bar is, uh  somewhere."
"Hey, you and Natasha,"
- you sure she's going to want to see you?
"- Dude, she loves me."
She never judged me.
- Worst thing I ever did...
- Dumped her?
Yeah.
"Thank-- Thank everybody, please."
"- Yeah, just let us know."
- Just let us-
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- If you get some more info.
- If there's an update.
- Yeah.
Um...
Guys.
"Look, this is the hard part."
Pete's gone.
"- Yeah, I know."
"- No, I mean, like, when someone is missing..."
"Hey, we've had more manpower on this than we've ever had looking for someone."
"I mean, I've got the fire department involved in looking for him and I hate firemen."
- No.
"- No, it means a lot."
- Yeah.
"- Ricky, thank you."
- No.
What Iâm trying to say is...
"You know, someone in Pete's condition?"
He didn't go anywhere.
He couldn't have gone anywhere.
He's gone.
He's in the river or something.
And it's hard when a body doesn't--
Doesn't turn up.
"Look, this isn't the first time I've had to have this talk, but... when it's people you know, it's hard."
"- What are you trying to say, Ricky?"
"- Horace, he's gone."
"- Ok, ok."

No.

What's your business here?
"No business really, we're just travellers."
Then you best keep travelling.
Ya...
Alright then.
Wait!
"Goran, you can't send them out there."
They look like they can take care of themselves.
May not even start tonight.

He has gone for a smoke.
- Gone for a smoke.
Alright.
Thanks.
Adi.
- Hi.
What do you think?
By when will Umbrella Creations' designs be ready?
"It will take another three-four days, sir."
The workload is very heavy.
Gul is there to help you.
She must have also prepared some designs.
I have thrown her sketches in the dustbin.
She is new.
She will learn gradually.
We should close Flora Enterprises and start a fashion institute.
Along with Gul everybody else will also learn.
Hold it.
Hold it there.
Just stop kidding.

What's the matter?
We've been robbed.
- How?
- On the train.
The gold was bound for the Bank of Munich.
It wasn't monitored?
The conveyors didn't last long.
- They were thrown off the train.
- By whom?
A man.
Dressed in black.
A conveyor crashed on a pylon.
The others could make it but they're in poor shape.
A man.
All in black.
- Are you Mr Fandor?
"- Yes, why?"
"You must go at once to 46 Bonaparte St, 4th Floor."
This is Juve's address.
You must be mistaken.
No.
Not at all.

I do not touch myself.
-It quiets.
You do not resist.
Right now!
"What, what have you done to me?"
"I'm gonna tell, I'll talk about that."
Just... give me your hand.
Come on.
Come on.
Alex.
What are you doing here?
Getting you out.
Please?
Here is a... cashier's check for 4 million dollars.
It's what you need to get that property from Taylor.
- And you want in on the deal?
- No.
I only want Chase.
"Alex, you do know that relationships between Pure Bloods and non Pure Bloods is frowned upon."
To speak nothing of a... financial arrangement between Erebus ans the House of Chthon...
Trust me.
"No one knows I'm here, this is strictly between you and me."
"So... take the money, buy whatever you want, but let Chase go."
You're buying me.
I'm rescuing you.
There's a difference.
"Yes, there is."
You're right.
"Since Berlin, I'm just not the same."
"Fine, go."
Let me say goodbye properly.

- What do you mean?
"If you stop now and nobody gets hurt, you won't have to go away."
"But before any of this, was there anything good in your life?"
"Yeah, I had my chair set up how I wanted."
Chicky and me had some things worked out.
"All right, you got your chair back, and I'm going to put Chicky in jail but I never noticed any shortage of whores in town."
"Now, come on, Ernie."
"What do you say, huh?"
"Come on, Ernie."
Come on.
Just take it easy.
Just relax now.
Come on.
That's it.
And he has to absolutely speak to me?
"Okay, I'll be right down."

You okay?
"- Yeah, thanks."
How you doing?
No fun busting this guy.
I think he's gonna get ROR'd.
- The booking's clear.
- Thanks.
DONNA:
"Detective, here's your file."
- I gotta take you to get fingerprinted.
- Thanks for the coffee.
I didn't do nothing.
I don't know what you're talking about.
"Stacey, put up that gun and listen."
You're sunk.
"I know it, big boy."
I just want you to listen to what this rat's gotta say.
Remember what happened to Limpy?
"In about two minutes, you're gonna get worse."
"Honest, Stacey."
I ain't done a thing.
"In two minutes, you're gonna get this .38 between the eyes."
"Don't shoot me, Stacey!"
I didn't never snitch on you.
I ain't talking about you snitching on me.
I'm talking about something I learned from Shake Edwards.
"No, I don't know nothing."
I'm talkin' about you framin' Ross into this joint.
Honest.
We never framed him.
[SCREAMS]
Start talking.
I can't.
I don't know.
"Wait, wait."
I'll talk.
Okay.
This is a confession without coaching.
"And it's gonna spring Ross, so remember it."
"Okay, canary."
Start singing.
Who framed Ross?
I did.
"Yeah, well, I fucked up."
After that night on the bridge...
I blamed you for Jimmy.
"Yeah, I blamed me, too."
- I looked for you at the funeral.
- I couldn't deal with it.
An empty coffin like my mom's...
The river took half my family.
"It never gave them back, either."
I was wondering what happened to that picture.
"You, me and Jimmy at my dad's cabin."
All going to be cops.
- Brilliant idea.
- Look at us now.
I'm a dropout.
Jimmy's dead.
- And you're one of those...
- Water dogs.
It wasn't your fault what happened to Jimmy.
He had something wrong with him.
"He did, like my mom."
"Nobody noticed it, until he beat that suspect."
But I noticed it...
I never did anything about it.
You did the right thing.
- Fuck 'em.
- Fuck 'em.
"- So, are you back now?"
- I'm back.
- You want to get something to eat?
"- No, I've got to meet a girl."

Was it you?
It was neither of us.
"Well, whoever it is is extremely gifted."
"Yes, they are."
Now if you'll excuse us.
- You don't think that was rather rude?
"- No, I do not."

It's no good looking at me.
Who was that then?
I don't know.

"Oh, that would be very kind, Adam."

I'm afraid I've lost my line.
Cut.
Jesus.
Twenty-three takes.
We only stopped because we ran out of film stock.
The War Office wanted him.
The distributors wanted him.
And no one thought to give him a bloody screen test?
"Well, can't we replace him?"
This film has a significant part to play in putting the national case to the American public.
- He's the template.

Is Mr. Baker all right?

You asked how long we've been friends a minute ago.
Oh yes...
Alright.
- We met in a hospital.
- In a hospital?
Yea.
"It was that dull hospital over at Lexington, know it?"
No.
We were doctors.
"I mean, surgeons."
Violet tells me to say surgeons.
"Working at the hospital never gave me bad dreams, that's for sure."
"Anyway, she's my best friend ever."
I'm kinda worry about her sometimes though.
"Half the time, I wish I was more like her."
And then...
What?
I don't know.
She reminds me of my daughter.
Is that her on the phone machine?
But it's not important.
"It is, but... don't let it distract you."

- What's with what?

Capote scared them.

That's what makes the book special.
"Yes, that's part of it."

"No, no, no."
"No, everything's great."

So the doors are off because...?
"Long story short, a few years ago, I locked Allie in her room and tried to strangle her with a nightgown."
I totally get it.
"Uh, my brothers and I used to fight all the time."
- It's not like your brothers.
- You don't know my brothers.
"Ha, ha."
"So your sister tried to kill you, why?"
The smoke detectors told me to.
Why they didn't just tell you to bake muffins is anybody's guess.
Did the smoke detectors talk to you?
"Yeah, mostly, back then."
Ahem.
"Luke, did Allie even tell you that she had a sister?"
"Yeah, yeah, but just that you were in law school."
"Now, if somebody comes around your little sister and starts talking like that, you just gonna stand there and smile?"
No.
"You're gonna ask him to stop, which I did."
"And if they don't stop, what?"
You're not gonna do anything?
So are you saying you should not have apologized?
Not the way he's talking.
So that's a yes?
He didn't deserve an apology.
He deserved worse than what I gave him.
I should've messed him up worse.

So we'll be heading south towards Lisbon and home.

What for?
What are we doing up here anyhow?
"Did you ask Major Dunnett or Captain Murray to explain their orders, Harper?"
No.
"But with all due respect, Captain Murray and Major Dunnett were proper officers."
"Now they're dead, there's no shame in going home."
We go north at dawn to Casa Antigua.
"Carry on, Harper."
We've been having a chat.
We?
Me and the lads.
And?
We're not continuing north.
We want to go south.

Who is Cilly sitting with?
Maybe some truckdriver.
She's into that type.
That's Biberkopf.
I've known him for a while.
Just released from prison. 4 years.
Why?
"Ida, his wife."
He killed her during a binge.
Not too bad.
"Done eating and drinking, she wanders off."
What's he doing here?
Do I owe you something?
You'd better not bother me.
You were in Tegel!
"- Yes, but that's over."
- You're a tough guy.
I'll start my own business:
"Matches, newspapers, suspenders"
You're not gonna earn anything with that.
The main thing is that one lives his life decently.
Isn't that right or am i correct?
- What's your name?
I'm not wearing pants.
Told you!
Nina told me why she dumped me.
She said I was too needy.
Am I too needy?
Tell me!
I need to know!
"Fez, I'm sorry, man."
You're the definition of needy.
"Remember, one time, you called me at 3:00 in the morning... just to make sure we were still friends?"
"Look, if you wanna get Nina back, you gotta act like you don't care."
- But I don't know how to do that.
"- Well, we can help you."
Oh!

You know that I have not seen jalon...
For twelve years?
"Those were some times, huh?"
"Yeah, they, uh..."
They were some times.
But they were a little different for you than they were for me.
What do you mean?
"Well, uh, I was there, and you were here."
Were you really?
Where do you think I was...

"What I meant was, I haven't been out with anyone who was in Vietnam before."
"Well, most people from scarsdale wouldn't have."

"It'sjust a start. I mean, I know you're too old for a twin bed."
"It's a nice bed, Roy."

Why are you so quiet ?
I don't feel like talking.
"Derek, there's something I oughta tell you."
I said something to Sara.

I didn't see him for days.
I started looking for him.
in the house...
In his room...
I couldn't find him.
I asked around the village.
I checked with those who knew him.
But nobody had seen him.
He disappeared with the Revolution.
"In 1956, the Russians invaded the country..."
I never saw him again.
I remember...
Once he was very sick.
He took my hand.
He looked at me as if he was begging for something...
"He called me ""SeIma""."
I didn't understand.
"But now, that I know more about his life..."
I realize that he never saw who I really was.
Something like that...
Don't you notice the smell?
I can't stand it.
What a terrible experience!
It smells like something died!
"Haven't you noticed it, too?"
"Yes, but there are several tanneries around here."
- Tanneries?
- Tanneries.
"If they're tanning hides, it's the skin from the ass."
- A tough one!
"- Stop, I can't stand this stench."
Stop!
I think it's coming from that guy in the back!
- Are you going to leave me like this?
- Wimp!
"Dear God, it's not fair."

Tell him to come up.
I want to see him in the lobby.

Good voice.
What'd you think of the Julie Jordan?
"Good act, no voice."
My Nettie could sing better.
"We met 25 years ago, Westbury-- l heard about that."
"Speaking of performances, Frank."
I don't wanna hear about another one like this morning.

"So, Evelyn used you to do the grunt work to track him down."
She shows up and finishes the job.
"And when she kills him, everyone comes looking for you."
She seemed so nice.
"Mike, she went through Lucy to get to you."

Call Lucy.
Evelyn's not the type to leave loose ends.
- Right.
Oh.
Almost forgot.
That's for you.

Now you look in the bag.
-Saw her getting off the train.
-Went right over to Doc Reid's.
[CROWD laughing]
[singing bird playing ON TOY piano]
"You must leave at once, Brice."
Do you realize I've never even touched him before never been close enough to look into his eyes;
-He's a fine boy.
-You shouldn't have come here.
Brock.
Did you hear me?
- Einar?
- Yes.
- Second row.
- Thanks.
Here you go.
"Come, let's go inside."
"Sunday, February 20th 1944"
Thanks for last night.
Thank you.
"Remember, you can come visit me as often as you like."
"It's not that far, and I can come get you."
No choice?
We could sink the ship out on the sea!
- Not according to the British.
- I don't believe them.
"- Well, tell them."
- That's what you should do!
"I did, but it turned out this way."
Taking the lives of 50 innocent people.
You have to stop it.
The bomb is already onboard.
The ferry departed several minutes ago.
- You went for the ferry all along.
- That's not true.
Of course...
Then you'll be done with all this shit  and you can finally go back to Norway.
- Two coffees.
What do you want?
- Juice.
- Good morning.
- 39 barrels down.
You're damn straight I did.
"I endorsed your reinstatement, Ranger."
That means you shit the bed and I gotta clean the sheets now.
"Thing is, sir, captains don't endorse reinstatements."
- They don't?
- Nope.
"I don't know who the hell you are, but you sure as shit ain't Chance Holbrook."
[laughs]
"Well, you got me there."
"Déjà vu, Rinche?"
You son of a bitch.
Holbrook was a good man.
"Ooh, are you sure about that?"
Because he was going to finger you for Tony's murder.
[grunting]
"- Come on, come on..."
"- Hey, hey!"
"- I wouldn't do that, Kate."
- Scott...
Agh!
"Holy shit, you shot me!"
[grunting]
Let's go!
Come on!
[grunting]
"- [pounding on door] - [Carlos] Open up, rinchesito!"
"It's too late, Carlos."
Your boss already took the key.
It is useless without the map.
"Hand over the bonds, because I am not leaving without them."
"Well, then I guess you're not leaving."
[loud grunt]
"Keeps calling me, says.."
..a little investment can take me far there
"But I say, I am too old to settle in a new place."
Johnny bhai.
My money is stuck somewhere.
I will rent the room as soon as I get it back.
Play chess with me every night.
Stay for free as long as you like!
When are you coming to get us?
I'll be there soon!
Why?
Has something happened?
"No, but just come and get us fast."
I'll be there don't worry!
"Hello, Kavita ma'am..."
Mukesh here.
Who Mukesh?
There is no Kavita here...
Don't call back again.
"Hello, Reena ma'am."
This is Mukesh here.
You haven't called last few days so I thought I should call and inquire.
Wrong number.
Mrs. Kajal?
This is Mukesh calling.
Usha ma'am.
This is Mukesh calling.
Mrs. Vandana?
- Wrong number.
"Sorry, I won't call back again."
"Hello, Sarika ma'am... I have told you not to call here..."
Don't call back again.
-Start with the truth.
The super saw you leave her apartment before water came through the ceiling.
Let me ask you a question.
What question did you just ask me?
What was the question you asked me?
When the last time you saw her was.
"I told you the last time that I saw her alive, right?"
"-When I saw her after, she was dead."
"-Why didn't you call it in then, Mike?"
I had a couple of changes of clothes and shaving stuff in the apartment.
Where's the stuff now?
"It's in my locker, John."
Couple of shirts and some shaving stuff.
"Come on, let's go."
SlPOWlCZ:
Come on.
KELLY:
Let's go take a look.
"Beautiful, beautiful."
Great.
That's beautiful.
Embarrass me in front of the department.
Great!
-Nobody's gonna embarrass you.
ROBERTS:
"Yeah, right."
-What's it look like?
-l don't know.
-He deny the super's story?
-Says he was there after she died.
-Only time he was there.
-Believe him?
Next up there...
Carlos.
They will be the local authorities.
Good morning gentlemen.
We came from the Balkans.
This is the king of Belgium.
We are a diplomatic mission.
Excuse me?
He is Albanian.
She does not speak Italian?
We are in Albania.
How 'in Albania'?
"Oh, I do not believe it."
Are you sure?
- Yup.
Let's go down and ask for a phone.
"Carlos, what happened?"
- They'll be the currents.
How 'the currents'?
- There are so many currents at sea.
Well then we go down.
We went to Montenegro.
There we bought a boat there.
We were to get to the sea.
"No, excuse me, in Italy."
The captain of the Albanian port was not impressed.
He smoked a lot
While Ludovic tried to explain the situation.
But nothing to do.
"For him, we were just the sociable."
- Can I have a glass of water?
Please...
Me?
No.
I'd make a terrible husband.
Huh.
All men say that.
"Even I say that, and I have 1 0 children and 43 grandchildren."
But you didn't come all the way out here just to hear an old man bragging.
"Well, Rick sent me."
I'm looking for a woman.
"You don't look like you need any help, but the best one I got just went in for the beer."
"Oh, no."
"See, you don't understand."
I'm not just lookin' for any woman.
"I mean, not that Kiki's any woman."
She's beautiful.
"I'm sure she's a special, sweet girl."
"Hey, brahda, just kidding."
Just kidding.
"Who's this wahine, this woman, you're looking for?"
- Did you ever hear of the Wiki-Wiki Club?
- Sure.
I was the bartender there... from '39 to '43.
Good club.
High-class wahines.
Not like the girls working the streets today.
- Did you know many of the women who worked there before the war?
"- Hey, brahda, I knew them all."
- You know what I mean.
- How 'bout this one?
Her name was Diane Westmore.
She disappeared in the attack in '41 .
"Sorry, brahda."
It was a passionate affair.
I knew it was wrong.
What am I supposed to do?
"Said she'd kill her husband, I should kill my wife so we could live together."
I just let it go.
I thought it was talk.
"The next thing you know, lo mató, Mr. Garcia is dead."
She did it.
Son of a bitch.
But I'm still thinking that she did it because he was beating her.
-This is when I talked to your detective.
-Detective Kelly.
"Yeah, yeah."
Then she gives me a call three days ago.
"She calls me from prison, right?"
"""l did my part,"" she says."
"""Now you gonna do yours. """
That's why I was upset when you came over.
Now I realize that she's crazy.
She says she murdered him so we can live together forever.
-Your wife knows nothing about this?
-l confessed.
-She knows I'm here.
-You did the right thing.
I had to.
What about if she gets off on bail?
"She's angry with me, the next thing you know--"
SlPOWlCZ:
Yeah.
-M.E.'s office says Devlin's on his way.
-Toxicology?
-He didn't say.
"Master, we shouldn't show them too much of our sword fighting."
"Master, they'll imitate our Chin Kang Fist."
The Wu-tang won't imitate your Shaolin fist.
The Shaolin won't imitate your Wu-tang sword.
Don't despise our Wu-tang kung-fu.
"I think sooner or later, we'll have a competition with Wu-tang."
I'll be expecting you!
"Alright, go!"
"Mr. Hong, Chung-Ian, come!"
"Mr. Hong, please drink it!"
"Come on, bottoms up!"
Bottoms up!
"Don't hesitate, drink it!"
That's more like it!
"- Chung-Ian, serve them well."
- Please excuse me.
I've got to go out for a walk.
Please don't leave!
He feels shy around women.
Not like me!
Yes... you're more handsome.
Ridiculous!
What do you mean?
Don't stop me!
Please be more polite!
That's none of your business!
Don't get angry!
"Shut up, or I'll beat you!"
Get up!
Let's go and have a look.
What's happened?
Don't go!
Come on.
I wanna have a talk with you.
Doesn't that make you feel proud and dignified?
"Oh, boy."
"Hey, that's a honey of a dashboard too."
"Strictly airplane type, Mr. Taylor."
"- Yeah, airplane, huh?"
- Mm-hm.
- Good-looking cigarette lighter.
- Yes.
- Does it work?
"- Sure, it works."
Try it.
You get 18 miles on a gallon with this car.
That ought to mean a lot to a man in your circumstances.
- Oh!
"Yeah, heh, it works all right."
- Sure it works.
You get more for your dollar than in any car in this country.
- You'll want delivery.
- I won't know till tonight.
- I'm getting a new job and a raise.
- Congratulations.
I wouldn't wanna sign till they tell me.
I'd hate to see you wait too long.
This is the only light-colored phaeton.
Tell you what.
You got my number.
Give me a buzz.
- Be glad to.
- Okay.
- Thank you.
What?
Fucking what?
"When I was leaving the bar that night, all I could think about... was the time you tipped over the Porta-Potty while I was in it."
W...
Okay.
Fuck me.
I was an asshole to you when we were kids.
"But we're not fucking kids anymore, Pete."
I could lose my fucking career over this.
"- Yes, you are."
- What?
- Still a kid.
- What are you...
What?
I might have slashed your tire.
"That's shitty, but it's what I did."
What I didn't do was make you beat the piss out of that kid.
Who are you?
[door opens]
What the hell is wrong with you two?
Nothing.
It was all a misunderstanding.
"You're family, for Christ's sakes."
There's nothing in the world more important than that.
- [line ringing]
- Fucking animal.
Eddie:
Marius?
Eddie?
Wait a minute.
How'd you get a phone?
I told Karolina if I didn't talk to you that I was out.
"If you don't want to add being poor to that, don't provoke me!"
I'm very sensitive.
"In Yoon Jae's hospital, wearing Yoon Jae's clothes, and laying down on Yoon Jae's bed..."
You really seem like Yoon Jae.
-Well...
Ummm.
-Don't say anything.
Give me your hand.
"I knew it, it's not warm."
Your temperature is different.
Since you're not Yoon Jae...
You're not as warm as Yoon Jae.
That's a relief.
Since I want to be cool.
Let's go now.
I...
I...
I... grabbed his hand!
What?
In the water...
I thought I was going to die...
But Seo Yoon Jae reached out his hand towards me.
If I were to live...
I thought I should go towards him...
So I grabbed onto his hand.
I wonder...
If that's why I came in this body?
If the switch happened because you and Yoon Jae grabbed hands...
"Do you think if you held hands again, you two will switch back?"
What if he doesn't wake up?
I'm sure he'll wake up!
Hurry up and grab it.
"Oh my God, you're serious!"
So where were we?
What am I wearing?
"Well, nothing, naturally."
Ha!
Ha!
Charles?
Hello?
Charles?
Charles!
Battery!
No!
[ Her screams echoes. ]
[ Amaar is banging his head on the table. ]
I can't believe you built a bomb.
I didn't build a bomb!
I merely collected a bunch of things that look like bomb-making things!
"It was not a crime, just suspicious and very costly."
"- Well, you proved your point."
"- I know, and it breaks my heart!"
"Then why'd you do it, Baber?"
Because I was happy with the way things are!
[ He starts whining. ]
OK!
"Baber, that's what this is about?"
"Look, nothing's going to change!"
The mosque will always be there for you.
It doesn't matter anyway.
"By this time tomorrow,"
We'll be in solitary confinement together.
[ The door opens. ]
OK!
"If anyone's going to make it in this town, it's going to be me and my band The Teardrops."
"Livi is recording in my sister Megan's studio, so she's hooking me up with some sweet backstage passes."
"Gotta go, amigos, don't want to be late for the rehearsal."
See ya.
I'm sick of Tanya throwing shade on us.
I gotta go.
I'm late for the hotel.
"Come on, buddies."
Oh.
"Mia, hang on a second."
Let me get this straight.
- You're going to Heartlake Hotel?
- Yeah.
Because you're the official dog walker?
So you've got access to where Livi is staying?
I guess.
"Olivia, memory-stick me."
Voilà.
The key to our success.
But Tanya said that Livi's going to Heartlake Studio.
Even better.
Give it to her there.
This is it.
Stardom awaits.
"Argh, slow down."
"No, I could have done, he said..."
Excuse me.
"Yes, I'll be sure to pass that on."
Thank you.
Deliveries are around the back.
"Actually, I'm here to see Livi."
I'm sorry.
What is it?
"""Ochie and Friends."""
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"""Ochie and Friends."""
Great.
"And who is Ochie, or what is it Ochie?"
"They're, like, these beings from, like,"
"Far, far into outer space."
And they're in their own kind of solar system.
But they have to go to a totally different planet.
"And they're only, like, 12."
But they still get all this stuff.
And they get rockets.
It sounds too good for Troma.
It sounds like big Hollywood.
We're a small company.
"You guys haven't seen any of our movies, probably?"
No.
Our movies are kind of raunchy.
So it sounds pretty good.
"Let's get together, and maybe I can be helpful."
And I'll certainly try to help you with it.
"It's nice of you to help your brother, too."
Yeah.
Good older brother.
"Well, we'll try to-"
- Troma team will help the Ochie team.
"Anyway, have a great day and thank you."
Thank you.
Good luck with it.
Thanks.
Bye.
You'll be fine.
"I'm not actually talking, am I?"
This is bad.
I'm just going to go call for a...
Just try not to move.
This is really bad.
If there's a Smokey or a mobile EMT unit with your ears on...
I got a seriously injured fellow here on Route 7.
"I got you, good buddy."
He's on the shoulder and...
Good.
Block him from oncoming traffic... with your truck.
Don't run him down.
I don't think the company would be too crazy about...
Just do it.
I'll call the Sheriff's Department...
"This is Deputy Frank Downes, Oxford County Sheriff's Department."
I have my ears on and am en route.
Copy.
"All right, so are we, Deputy Downes."
"Kingdom, this is Castleview 19."
Do you read?
"Five-by-five, 19."
We're going mobile.
"Sir, can you hear me?"
"Sir, can you move your arms and legs?"
How's he looking?
The right pupil is fixed and dilated.
The left pupil...
I don't know.
"Say again, Ollie?"
"It is Ollie, isn't it?"
I thought it was an apron.
"And this is supposed to be the new me, doing things properly."
Beggar!
No - this needs more than a beggar.
This needs a bugger.
Bugger!
"Oh, heck."
Oh... oh... oh...
"# Overweight, overwhelmed"
# I've overstepped the mark
# Help me out
# I'm whistling in the dark
# But something I saw in you
"# Gave me a sense, a clue"
# To what I had lived without
# The sun came out
# You think a heart can never melt
# You don't expect a thaw
# But feelings just accosted me
"# And sort of, well, defrosted me"
# And left me in a puddle on the floor
"# No choice, to see it through"
# I couldn't turn away
# From what I glimpsed in you
# That day. #
"Letting them stay all night now, are you?"
What?
"We saw your fancy man come, but we didn't see him go."
"Hey, Mam!"
I'm doing me hair like Mr Kirkby's.
You're not going.
Get upstairs.
Thank you so much for seeing me.
- You look beautiful.
- Thanks a lot.
- Let me get that.
It's my pleasure.
So how can I help you?
- They're going to throw me out.
- Who?
- Morty Brill.
- No one'll throw you out.
He says I'm under-occupied.
Can I help it if my daughter moves out?
Isn't she entitled to a life of her own?
Of course.
How is Helene?
- Still working at the navy yard?
- Thanks to you.
"So what can you do for me, Mr. Anselmo?"
"Well, it's simple."
See that Mr. Brill obeys the law.
You're grandfathered in over there.
"If he says you're not, call me."
A landlord like Morty Brill looks for ways around rent control.
How would he understand a law meant for working stiffs like you and me?
"Thanks, Mr. Anselmo."
Thanks a lot.
Mr. Schwartz is right outside.
"Thanks, Clara."
- I'm sorry.
- Would you come speak to my club?
Which club?
Terrible Tiles Mahjong Club.
- Internet?
- We can help.
Find out what makes us hostage.
Must enter the cabin.
Addons Your job is not complete.
I tried ...
I tried!
Addons Do not let him reach the trunk.
Addons stopped him!
Addons you have 3 minutes or she would die.
Can see and hear everything you do.
You should not mix.
"But, you have to do something, Gwen."
- I have to get out.
"- No, no, no, please!"
Addons three minutes.
Gwen Addons and you fail in your mission.
"Addons View Hi, if you die, Just like your friend ..."
Addons not have to kill his brother.
"Addons Come, Jo, you lose the show."
Addons I think you like these things.
Addons may prefer younger men.
What is your problem?
Addons I put a mirror in front of you.
Addons To see how good you are.
Addons Although ...
Addons All of us have blood now in our hands.
"No, please, do not do this."
It's the only way to save my child.
Please.
No!
You should get the boot.
These objects were taken from him and these are the personal belongings found in his cell.
You have to sign here.
Sir?
You have to sign here.
"Benigno, it's me."
Alicia is alive.
You woke her up.
"When I heard your message,"
"I raced back to the jail to tell you, but Iwas too late."
I put Alicia's hairclip in your pocket.
"And I also put in a photo of her and one of your mother,"
so that they'll be with you for all eternity.
Waves.
Cruel waves.
"The male below, the female above."
I find water.
You sit down.
Are you all right?
Yes.
I don't know.
I'm much better now.
What?
"Come along, let's go inside."
"OK, you are shaking."
OCR failed!
What is the matter?
What did you say to her?
Nothing.
I saw you talking.
Alicia asked me if I felt all right and I thanked her.
"If you see me in your neighborhood, don't worry."
I live across from your Academy.
What happened?
I yawned.
Will be best if I am packing and i'm on my way.
"I think, I was not the wrong one."
"I asked it, you are not sleepy."
"But, he not sleepy, respectable major lord."
Why did he yawn then?
Why you yawned my Lajos?
I don't know.
Only some.
Only some?
Did you yawn because you feel well possibly?
"Yes, major lord."
"Here you go to believe, major lord."
That's right.
"Please make a statement, dear Tót."
What would you do now the with pleasure?
- May I be honest?
- Of course.
Well...
I now the with pleasure...
I would make a box a little.
Yes?
"- And you, Mariska?"
- I too.
- Ágika?
"- I too, of course"
If you insist on him this much...
I do not regret it.
"I ask you for it only, let this not occur repeatedly."
No.
Never again.
"Souta-kun is a good person, and kind too, and we get along well, and it's fun to spend time together."
That's why...
"I was being two-timed, huh."
Two-timed?
- Eh?
Why does that sound like a question?
"Well, it's a regular two-timing, right?"
"You were continuing with your boyfriend, and also going out with me."
Going out...
Eh?
!
"Umm, Saeko-san."
"Saeko-san and I were going out, right?"
I asked you to go out with me and you said okay.
Eh?
Ah...
Yeah.
- These two months.
"It's just been two months, but."
"Well, look, we even kissed, right?"
"Ah, but, we didn't have sex."
"Oh, I see."
"If you don't have sex, it's not called going out."
So it's not two-timing either.
...What?
!
Is that how it is?
Is that how society works?
"Saeko-san is correct, and I'm wrong?"
I don't know what's what anymore.
Wait.
Let me collect my thoughts.
Where is she?
You go to hell!
You gonna burn.
- Garcia.
"- [Garcia] Friends, we're on three-way."
What's going on?
"Hotch, we found some pictures of Kaman's girlfriend at his apartment."
[Garcia] So I blew up those pictures.
"In one of them, she appears to be in a restaurant."
"So I zoomed in on the sign that says ""O'S,"""
cross-checked that with restaurants in the area.
There are five diners.
"Three are in the suburbs, two are in Highland Park, ...and one is in Rivertown."
- [Hotch] What's the name?
Jay-Mo's.
And this appears to be Kaman's and that girl's favorite place 'cause all the pictures were taken there.
- Have you heard of Jay-Mo's?
- It's a few blocks from here.
"Good work, Garcia."
We're on the way.
"You're sick, Kaman."
We done talking!
This ain't the way.
Then tell me where she is.
"If she ain't with you, I know where she is."
[Man] Don't do it.
Leave Tracy alone.
Kaman... [shuddering breaths]
It's too late for her.
And it's too late for you.
Kaman!
"[Garcia] Hotch, a fire alert just went out."
Don't bathe in the evening!
You could have a chest-congestion!
We Brahmins always bathe before we cook.
Great woman!
She observes cleanliness even at this age!
"You bathe everyday, don't you?"
What do you mean?
"I mean, it's good to bathe everyday!"
Wow!
She is even religious...
What a chaste woman!
Jai!
What are you up to?
The water wouldn't flow the drain!
So I came down!
Jai!
What's that?
You're wearing a matrimonial necklace!
It belonged to my mother.
When she died... my father asked me to preserve it carefully.
And what's that...
on your forehead?
"Eyebrows, eh?"
It's a dot!
This doesn't belong to Mom.
Aunty gave it to me and said...
"""You have a necklace."
"Complete the picture with a dot""!"
You must wear it on your forehead.
Jai!
I'm here too!
"Talk to me, when you're through with her!"
It's too dangerous to go on.
We should return to Puyo.
Sayong's right.
Guys with grudges will hunt you down like a mad dog.
Mad dogs are best when avoided.
"Let's turn back, Miss."
I heard they still call him commander.
Commander?
But they're bandits.
- That's nonsense.
- It's not that simple.
(Oi) They train harder than soldiers do.
They're willing to die for their commander.
(Mari) No wonder the soldiers are no match.
(Hyupbo) This is bad...
Captain.
There's no point in pushing forward.
We should go back to Puyo.
He's right.
Talk to Sosuhno.
"Actually, I want to go to Gosan no matter what happens."
But Sosuhno is our leader and we should wait for her decision.
Come with me.
Where to?
To the bandits' hideout.
What?
What for?
I want to check them out.
Cap...
(Puyo Palace)
What do you want?
"(Yangjung, Hyunto governor) We're going to attack the Southwest Yi."
"Let's leave it to Adam, eh?"
"So, Adam, what's it to be?"
"A life of comfort and privilege, and all the pleasures that a young man could ever dream of... or hardship, desperation and hunger?"
I choose them.
"Er... you may need to be a little bit more specific, Adam."
"Oh, yeah."
"I mean you, George and Nina."
"I choose you, yeah."
- Ooh!
- Yes.
What did you say?
"Well, I don't want this."
"I mean, it's completely fucked up."
Look.
"Adam, for goodness' sake, drink the man's blood and have sex with me on the billiard table."
- You are embarrassing us.
"- Look, get off me, you munter."
- Adam!
"- And up yours, you no-neck gaylord."
Hm!
Don't you dare speak to your father like that.
Father?
He's not my father.
Right.
I've had enough of this.
Oh.
"Ah, these are not your people."
These animals!
"Yeah, tell it to someone who gives a shit."
"- OK, I think we've made our point."
"- Come on, come on."
"Oh, take him and his ingratitude."
"302, 00:23:34,330 -- 00:23:35,286 Okay."
You guys need anything ?
"No, we're good."
So how long have you two been friends?
"306, 00:24:06,820 -- 00:24:10,689 I'm not suppose really to talk to you any more, so ..."
Oh wait !
I think you got a phone message.
But that's all I'm saying.
Now I got to zip.
You have one new message.
This really is the last time I'm going to say this to you...
Okay ?
Or anything else.
I don't want you to send me anything anymore.
"313, 00:24:43,023 -- 00:24:45,515 I don't..."
I threw out the flowers.
"314, 00:24:45,734 -- 00:24:47,942 You can't fix it!"
And I'm really done with you.
"I don't want to talk to you again, I don't want to hear from you again."
I want you to leave me alone ...
Um... me and Vi have been friends for a pretty long time...
Maybe three years.
What?
You asked how long we have been friends a minute ago.
Oh yes .
Right.
We met in the hospital.
In a hospital ?
Yea.
"326, 00:25:36,910 -- 00:25:40,620 It was that dull hospital over at Lexington."
Know it?
No.
"Maybe if I was like that movie kid, Haley Joel Osment I could pay her that much."
"But if that meant being good at drama, forget it."
I was crap at drama.
'Cause I hated standing up in front of people.
"So, basically, I had to go to school."
"The sad fact is that, like any island dweller from time to time I had to visit the mainland."
This is Imogene.
You can hold her if you like.
That's...
"Well, okay."
Yeah.
Got her.
Lovely.
"Yeah, she's delightful, isn't she?"
I know.
Isn't she?
"To tell the truth, I'm being crap with her."
You better take her back.
She could've been yours if you got your act together.
"Just think of that, yeah."
"So, the place is looking really nice."
"Barney, Barney, Barney."
"Say hello to Will, Barney."
Here we go.
It's the Antichrist.
"Hello, Barney."
How are you?
-He's lovely.
-Yeah.
"And what about you, Will?"
Any desire for a family of your own yet?
I'd rather eat Barney's nappies.
I told them how the world really works.
"How there were predators, how we had to adapt."
"I led them here, under the great ice."
No one can find us here.
But we're still at the bottom of the food chain with no significant purpose.
"Well, we all have a purpose."
Yours is to change the world.
What possible difference... could one krill make?
"Wait and see, Will."
You wait and see.

- What are you looking at?
"Don't know, but it sure is ugly."
"Notice, boys, the witty riposte as weapon?"
Right.
"Outside, now!"
We are outside.
"- Come on, then."
- No... you come on.
MUMBLE:
Excuse me.
Bryan?
- Huh?
MUMBLE:
Down here.
"Ah, g'day, chief."
What are you doing here?
"Bryan, I need a favor."
A big one.
"For you, champ, anything."
Get on the stage now!
Big Mouth...
"No, no!"
Here to collect the laundry money again?
- Stop!
- Forget about the money!
Forget it!
Wash my wife's underwear as well!
In that case...
Are you going to do it?
!
Yes.
But my big sister will not be happy.
I'll throw you out!
No!
Help me!
"Help me, please!"
"Wong Fei-hung, that's the end of your lion."

We've got a good reputation in GuangZhou.
Now you're a fugitive.
"We've been partners before, but now I want to stay on the right side of the law."
"White Tiger, you shouldn't cause any more trouble."
We were once like brothers.
Have this to tide you over.
"Look, I've got a few students working in the opera troupe."
Go and hide there until this case blows over.
Then we'll talk again.
"You can owe anyone money, but not me, or I'll destroy you!"
"The sooner I fill out my report, the sooner I can get back to them."
"Enormous beast, yeah... ."
Biggest thing here is the homecoming queen.
"Oh, my God!"
"Come on, I need a witness."
-It's around the corner.
-Don't pull so hard.
It's like a chomp out of the side of the car.
"It's like a bite out of a sandwich, Iike a--"
"What are we looking at here, Mr. MansIey?"
"Something big, Marv."
Something big.
hello!
Come out!
"Hey, big metal guy, I got food here for you!"
metal!
"Crunchy, delicious metal!"
Come and get it!
"So I guess you're not gonna hurt me, huh?"
The shutoff switch.
You saw me save you.
So where are you from?
"You came from the sky, right?"
From up there?
Don't you remember anything?
Maybe it's that bump on your head.
Do you talk?
"You know, words? ""blah, blah, blah,"" like that?"
Can you do that?
"well, you get the idea anyway."
Let's see.
See this?
She did work for me.
"I've, uh, got some paperwork in the car we need to fill out."
"Uh, sorry."
Nonsense.
I'm only sorry we had to do this at all.
Yeah.
"[ Lyle ] Be right with you, sir."
"Melvin, why were you contradicting Mr. Truesdale?"
"Well, it seems like the girl meant a lot more to his son than he wanted to let on."
The man was embarrassed.
Of what?
Of Greg's weak stomach.
"Melvin, if it wasn't for Mr. Truesdale, you wouldn't be coroner."
I'd remember that.
[ Woman ] That was her mother's.
It's the only thing she had left of her family.
They all died in the war.
Her father in North Africa... and her mother and her brothers in the firebombing of Dresden.
"Oh, Hillie."
Why?
After surviving all of that?
Why?
She was my friend.
I should have known.
I should have... stopped her.
Friends always feel that way when someone close to them dies.
Those are Hillie's.
I have to get them cleaned.
"No, no."
It's okay.
"No, I have to."
Hillie's clothes were always perfect.
But also continuously.
Martin?
-I'd like to say something.
-Yes.
"If it goes on like this, it will come to an end."
-Yes.
-I mean yesterday.
Yes.
Why did you let that idiot be with you?
We could have had a nice evening.
-Yes.
-Who are you constantly calling?
-Are you even listening to me?
-No.
I mean yes.
You get this from the pills.
Trying it on yourself!
What do you have your guinea-pigs for?
Some things in human homes are breakable.
And some are unbreakable.
What do people use it for?
"I don't know, people are strange."
And hang up when I'm speaking with you!
"No, I can't stand it."
When will this misery end?
!
Some things can open normally.
And some can't open at all.
But they can.
We must close the opening so that something else won't fly away.
-Some things play.
-And some things don't play.
"No, you killed a kid, you insane prick!"
(Groans)
I'm going to the cops.
With what?
A picture painted 400 years ago?
"I will find a way, I swear to God."
There is no way and you know it.

- Ah!
Fuck Camus.

"Come in, come in."
"Fiona, welcome, welcome."
Where's your stuff?
"Oh, I'm not staying the night."
"Oh, you're very welcome."
"The old sofa bed might be a little bit cramped, and the place has had a health warning slapped on it."
"No, thank you, I just wanted to explain my position."
"Oh, nothing to explain."
"It's all done, isn't it?"
Told you he'd be cool.
Mum's given us so much shit.
"Well, you know mothers."
What I feel for your son is very sincere.
Great.
"So, mate, I've got your favourite here - burgers and chips."
"Is that OK with you, Fiona?"
"Oh, you're not staying?"
"Finnegan, would you mind grabbing my purse?"
I think I left it in the car.
How is that different from what I was doing?
And I don't think you need to introduce the writers to the tour group.
I agree.
"I thought they would find it interesting, but they really did not."
"Well, Kenneth, just respect their privacy."
"I promise I'll do better, Mr. Hornberger."
I'm sure you will.
I just...
I just love television so much.
We all do.
"Liz, they want you and Pete on the 50th floor."
"Who, Gary?"
"All right, tell him I'll be up in half an hour."
"No, they said now."
"If they've got cookies up there, grab some."
"Ooh, and get them to pay for my samovar."
Of course.
I assume that's what we're meeting about.
What about Ray Romano?
Can you do Ray?
"[lmitating Ray Romano] Hey, aah, ho, Debra."
There you go.
My brother's tall!
[Normal voice] Right?
Are we in trouble or something?
No way.
Gary loves the show.
Pleased with the ratings.
"Right, of course."
They love us.
Where's Gary?
Gary's dead.
We head for Rochefort and the blockade squadron.
Sails on starboard bow!
That's the squadron.
"Deck, there!"
Flagship on the starboard bow!
- Strike topsail!
"- Lively, there!"
Stand by to drop anchor!
Wagstaffe?
Get your signals party ready.
Wait here.
You're mad!
You're all out of your minds!
- Dealing with an admiral?
- Jackson's an honest man.
He'll listen to us.
He'll agree until we surrender.
- Then he'll hang us.
- He won't.
I served under him in '89...
You'll see.
Mr. Crawford.
Vizard?
- Which of us goes to the flagship?
- None of us.
Why risk being clapped in irons?
I'll make them come to us.
Let go of the anchor!
Boat ahoy!

Josh.
That's a nice name.
"Josh doesn't remember too much about his part, but our staff psychologist thinks he's gonna be just fine."

- I don't suppose anyone here knows the origin of the marathon.

On a great plain called Marathon.
The Greeks were victorious and sent a runner back to the city with the glorious news.
The distance was that of the modern marathon.

I feel as though I saw something very nice.
That's wonderful!

"The tone, it's all fixed!"
Didn't I tell you that I'd absolutely fix it?
How about that?
Let's sing!
And the boy a rose did see
A rose standing in the field
Blossoming in innocence
Awed by the color it did yield
A never-ending fascination
For the crimson color
Of the rose standing in the field
Bravo!
You sound like angels.
This was amazing.

- Of sorts way.
- How?
I've no idea.
"Honestly, and I'm not going to stop and ask her."
I don't know why she likes me but I'm going to do my best to keep it that way.
Sounds like a good plan.
- When is it then?
- What?
- Date.
- Friday.
- What we up to Friday?
- Same as every Friday.

- How are you?
"- I'm fine, I guess."
"Actually, no, I'm not fine."
I just broke up with my boyfriend.

- I'm so sorry to hear that.
"- No, it's..."
- Do you want to hang out tonight?
- Sure.
- It was so fun.
You guys liked it.
- It was the most...
- Please tell me you got in the window.
- I got in the window.

What is going on?
What is the window?
"You know how everyone has that guy or girl who, no matter what happens, you always remember them being the perfect one for you?"
- Mike Scharz.
- Lily.
That girl right over there.
"Well, that girl for me was and still is Maggie Wilks."
We all went to college together.
She was awesome.
Everybody loved her.
I think I know what we're dealing with here.
Tell me when to stop.
It wasn't that Maggie was hot.
She was...
She was the ultimate girl next door.

Long ago I gave you an advice.
Forgo rangefinder your enemy with a smile.
I think you didn't learn.
I did.
I learned.
I also learnt that if you want to move ahead... pull down your opponent's pants.
He'll bend over and I'll hop over him.
And I'll win.
That's it.
Come on let's talk work.
There's a contract.
Let's sit and talk.
- Yes.
- You won't learn.
Let's talk business.
The job is from Home Minister Pradhan... and he's an old customer.
And the contract's ACP Thakur.
This boy recently arrived in Delhi.
And he tried to disgrace Ayushman's sister.
They need outside help so I had to come to you.
Uncle.
Is your information right.
Why?
What's wrong?
The boy looks decent.
I can't believe.
Sometimes innocent looking people... are the most dangerous ones.
And the Big Boss has accepted the contract... and that's it.
I'll bet Picnic is the first movie she saw when she came to the United States.
She looks like she's sleeping.
Sweet dreams.
"Al, she didn't commit suicide."
She was murdered.
Are you sure that's a bullet hole?
I saw more than a few of these in my last year in med school.
How could the chief of police miss this when he pulled her out of the water?
"Well, uh, maybe her hair was covering it or--"
I don't see an exit wound.
I guess the bullet's still in there.
"Sam, you're not gonna-- Al,"
"I'm a-- a doctor, right?"
"Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
"But, I mean, that-- that-- that does-- that doesn't mean-- Well, you know."
The only clue we've got... is the bullet.
[ Chuckling Nervously ]
I think I'm gonna go get a cup of coffee.
[ Metal Clinks ]
[ Sighs ]
"You can come out now, Al."
It's over.
- Is that the bullet?
- No.
Shrapnel.
I found it under an old scar behind her ear.
"Oh, from the war."
"Well, where's the bullet?"
There wasn't any.
There wasn't any?
Small entrance wound.

He went after the creature.
You let him go alone?
"Well, he wanted me to stay with you."
I am fine.
Go.

Sometimes we are allowed to make exceptions.
Who decides when it's one of those times?
We do.
That's good enough.

Yeah.
She tried feeding on me.
She wasn't going to let us take her back.
Yeah.

And do you believe it?
No.
But if I had to distribute the movie...
It would have destroyed it.
"Another question, Mr. Lloyd."
- Sure.
Did you pick up your finger?
Goodbye.
"This boat is a scrap, it's impossible."
For centuries it is not in the water.
What a scam.
I already have sea sickness.
"They did not have passports or money, so I bought a boat."
Not a very good one.
Are not there any ferries?
Are you sure?
He asked?
"- Yes, there is nothing else."
Look at it wet it.
- It's better than it looks.
Wood is rotten.
Look at how the wood is reduced.
- But you fuck like one.
- Chill.
- Did you hear what he said?
Jonas has got a 5 million dollar trust fund.
- Money's not everything.
- It is tonight.
Tommy?
...
Tommy?
- I made a couple of bad investments.
- So we've no more money?
- I took some chances.
- What about this summer?
- I sold the beach house.
- We just asked our friends to come.
- Cancel them.
- We'll be a joke.
The bank wants its money.
Nobody will lend me any.
- Come on.
- We'll never forgive you for this.
- I need your credit cards.
- What will we live on?
You'll have to stop shopping.
He's so way out of line.
I'll call five to tell them granny's fallen ill; you take the rest.
- Who are you calling?
- Philip.
I should do an Anna Nicole Smith.
Marry an 86-year-old billionaire.
She didn't even have to shag him.
And he died right away.
"Listen, Herr Mac..."
"I don't know what kind of people you're used to dealing with, but nobody tells me what to do in my place."
"Fraulein Ravenwood, let me show you what I am used to."
Take your hands off me!
Take your lousy hands off!
Wait a minute.
"Wait, I..."
I can be reasonable.
That time is passed.
You don't need that.
Wait...
I'll tell you everything.
"Yes, I know you will."
Let her go.
Whiskey.
Shoot them.
Shoot them both.
My medallion!
"Well, Jones, at least you haven't forgotten how to show a lady a good time!"
"Boy, you're something!"
"Yeah, I'll tell you what."
"Until I get back my $5,000, you're going to get more than you bargained for."
I'm your goddamn partner!
"Cairo, city of the living."
A paradise on earth.
Silence!
Why do you forget yourselves?
What is this?
Where did this animal come from?
"Oh... oh, no."
Cute.
What an adorable creature.
Can this bike hold all of us?
- No problem.
- Where are we heading to?
"Xiamu, don't disturb!"
"Xiaotian, faster!"
"Allright, got it!"
What if Xiamu injured?
What will we do ?
I don't want that happened either!
"In such situation,"
I could not stop the bike!
"Xiamu, let's go home."
Why you only care about Xiamu?
I got hurt and it is bleeding!
It hurts!
What's the matter?
Not even one question is done?
"If you are being lazy again, I'll paint your face."
Like a Spiderman!
Did Yawang send you?
- Hello!
- It's on the desk.
Where is the thing I sent you for?
On the desk.
"Your potraits were in the last few pages, how come they are gone?"
I took them.
You did?
Just tell me if you wanted them.
Let the master give you some guidance!
No painter holds pencil same way as writing!
"Like this,"
fingers and wrist should relax.
"Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe we went from Trey to a lengthy Volchok period."
"Hey, thanks for this."
Yeah.
"Now, unless you hit that Chili guy... or Johnny..."
I know a lot of people were rooting for that.
"Well, I did punch Johnny's dad."
Or a bounty hunter who worked for him.
Johnny's dad was a bounty hunter ?
"Oh, yeah."
I never told you that ?
"Excuse me, Doctor."
My wife needs to see someone right away.
What happened ?
I fell down some stairs.
You break anything ?
"I don't think so, but..."
She needs help.
"Everyone here needs help, sir."
You can fill out this form and wait your turn.
She's pregnant.
Any bleeding ?
"No, but something isn't..."
isn't right.
I'm sorry.
Try to make yourself comfortable.
Hang on a second.
Sandy...
"Hang on one second, all right ?"
I'll be right back.
"Excuse me, Doctor."
My wife would never complain.
She would never put her needs in front of anybody else's.
Heck no!
"Well, I thought you might be, asking such personal questions."
- Good night.
- Good night.
"Boss, she's a woman in a million."
- You think so?
- Yeah.
She don't talk.
Oh!
"All right, get on with the dogs."
"No, thank you."
I'll cross the way you men do.
Hold on!
Hold on!
Stick with it.!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Don't forget the gun!
Say!
"Nice, modest little prices they have here."
They practically give things away.
"Say, boss, how much we got this side of the grave?"
Just about enough for a room in a poorhouse.
This mansion over here'll do.
Come on.
"- Come on, Buck."
"- Come on, Buck."
"Well, Mrs. Blake, I guess it's about time to say good-bye."
There's an officer of the Mounted Police down the street.
They'll get you back to the States.
"We'd stake you ourselves, only, well, we've mislaid our funds."
"Yeah, yeah."
He was pretending to be unconscious.
I gave him another injection.
Now he doesn't have to pretend.
He has a weak heart.
You can only give him 30ccs within...
"Listen, we know what we're doing."
Is there anything else?
I've located the woman.
She is at the Robin Masters estate with a man named Magnum.
"- Yes, Mr Masters?"
"- 'Higgins, it's me.'"
How did you get this number?
I had it changed.
"'I was lucky, I guess."
I have a little problem.'
- How perceptive of you.
"- Higgins, I can't get out of the car."
'The car?
You've wrecked the car?
'
"No, I haven't wrecked it."
I just can't get out of it.
- Where are you?
- In the Audi.
The Audi?
"- Very clever, Magnum."
"- 'Just get the dogs, Higgins."
'Get the dogs.'
"Tommy, this is silly of you to bring me to this fancy house."
You wouldn't want me to take you some place sleazy?
That would be more in character.
"- More tea, Mrs Greenberg?"
There isn't going to be a place to live.
There isn't gonna be a honeymoon...
... becausethereisn't gonna be a wedding.
Okay.
And one other thing.
No little girl of mine is gonna be named Eudora.
[WOMEN gasping AND giggling ]
vin:
I figure it's been a while since you boys were in Texas.
YATES:
That right?
Yeah.
Texas is thataway.
Just shut up and ride.
EZRA:
"Here we go, gentlemen."
Here you go.
"Hey, I need me another drink over here."
I was not made for honest labor.
Inez:
Then let me do it.
Do what?
Tend your bar.
And clean and make repairs.
Until you and I really get the place going.
By then you'll make me your partner.
"Listen, señorita."
"Uh, I am not looking for a partner."
And you certainly cannot tend bar here.
And you can?
You see that gentlemen at the end of the bar?
He'd eat you like half a sandwich.
What task?
"Come to Wu Yen Road,"
You'll see a black car 9413.
On Friday thirteenth?
Just get into the car and I'll tell you what to do.
"Remember: better come early than late, late than never."
Right way!
"Not now, tonight!"
Tonight?
Then what shall I do now?
I even sent my secretary away!
Find something to do to kill time.
I haven't taken my milk yet.
Nuisance really!
Taxi...!
Shut up!
What the hell are you yelling about?
Damn you!
Shit!
"You think this is a night market, shut up!"
"Get lost, or I'll call the police."
Damn you!
"- Hi, Hitler!"
"- Hurry up, go!"
Go to the front!
Don't turn around!
There's match inside the drawer.
"Listen, a Jew has taken a ""Beast"" to H.K. from Europe."
To be handed to an American.
Your task is to help him find the American.
What does he look like?
The Jew will tell you.
I've never seen either of these.
I'm so sorry.
You know I have no choice.
I have to order the release of the detainee.
"If you live, my daughter dies."
- We'll call Jenny.
- She'll stay on top of Haskell.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
Why is your hand on my person?
"You, as a person of interest in this screwedup case, aren't going anywhere until I get answers."
Laura.
"Thank you, Jenny."
You'll follow him home?
You won't take your eyes off of him?
Cross my heart.
He's out.
"Down, girl."
Down.
I'm gonna sit by Mimi's bed in that hospital.
I'm not moving till she comes to and I.D.'s him.
Nico and a chick who should probably be committed... that's nothing new.
What's new is one who's worth the trouble.
Good luck at the hospital.
"Yeah, thanks."
"Welcome home, dirtbag."
"- Hello, officer."
- Ma'am.
Ma'am.
Is this Mimi's room?
"- She can't have visitors, ma'am."
- I'm a friend.
I'd like to be there when she wakes up.
- You don't have to wonder anymore.
Stop.
- Shock him.
- Clear.
He's flat.
This city takes care of its own.
Set a press conference for 12:00.
Make sure the Post takes the first question.
"You know what the first question will be ""Whose bullet was it?"""
"Call Senator Marquand, be cool."
Tell him everything's under control.
I'm just staying ahead of the curve.
"Abe, get a copy of Tino Zapatti's probation report."
Which Zapatti is that?
A nephew.
"One conviction, off on probation."
A punk.
We're headed for Park Drive.
How's about we swing over to the FDR?
We'll make better time.
What's your pleasure?
Where did the boy live?
Give me a read on the boy's apartment.
515 South 5th Street.
5th Street.
Marcy and Broadway.
That's where we're going.
"We've got no advance, no protection."
That's where we're going.
I'm the mayor.
"Make room here, please."
We need some help around here.
I can understand why people would want to pay to see her.
"Well, Julia, surely not."
(Julia):
"What are we doing but watching her, William?"
About time you paid for help.
How much you offering?
- Five cents.
- Ten.
"A nickel, final offer!"
What do you know?
- I seen him.
- Did you now?
- He went to see that beast in the cage.
- What of it?
I took him there.
Near the river.
- (birds singing) - ♪♪♪
What?
!
It was right here two days ago!
"Yes, I'm sure it was."
"Give us that nickel back, you little thief!"
The tent was right here!
Honest!
I swear it's the truth!
Here.
"You stay out of trouble, alright?"
"So, the victim was definitely attacked here at Travis's campsite."
Which the lying sod failed to tell us he moved.
Bloody Irish tinkers!
Nothing but trouble when they show up in their caravans.
Ten to one that that knife's the murder weapon.
The Jujyfruits?
"Yeah, the Jujyfruits."
"Okay, K-Man."
- Enjoy the book.
- Thank you.
"Listen, Jake where did you get those eyeglass frames?"
- I can't tell you.
- You don't know where?
"Yes, I do, but I don't want anyone else to have them."
"Well, that's peculiar."
"Oh, there's that woman that never talks to anybody."
Really?
Every day she comes in and reads.
Never talks to anybody.
"Oh, I spoke to Debby Biblow."
She said to say hi.
Really?
"Gary, I really have to say I'm a little bit hurt that you didn't decide to confide in me."
"Well, frankly, you can't keep a secret."
"You know, you'd get two pair, the whole table knows."
"Well, I still think it was wrong."
I'm sorry.
All right?
I guess I was just thinking of myself.
Yes.
So I called the litterbug a pig.
Not you.
I like policemen.
I wanted to be a policeman.
"Yeah, so why didn't you?"
I'm scared of being shot.
"Mr. Kramer, let me tell you a story."
"""That's my brother's boy."
"""I guess I heard of my own kin."""
"So I said, ""You spoke to him?"""
"He says, ""Spoke to who?"" I said, ""Ray Malcolm."""
"He said, ""Ray Malcolm?"
"""That's my brother's boy."""
Can you imagine the conversation when Ray shows up?
Want some rolls?
"Yes, ma'am."
Is this great or what?
DUD:
"This looks great, Cheryl Ann."
There you go.
I hope to hell he does show his heinie up there 'cause I got news for you.
That white trash and them two niggers...
Ow!
"That stung, Cheryl Ann."
You nearly broke my Le...
"Bonnie, pass me them pickles, will you?"
JOHN:
I never got any beans.
"Can I get some now, please?"
Mmm-hmm.
"Did you think I was going to cut you, honey?"
I wouldn't hurt you for anything in the world.
You know that.
Here.
I'm glad you didn't kill that man in the car lot.
What do you think we are?
"No, fuck all that, Dale."
It don't mean nothing.
What I'm concerned about is that we left ourselves so goddamn exposed...
I just walk around.
"I want to be swept off my feet, you know?"
I want my children to have magical powers.
I am prepared for amazing things to happen.
I can handle it.
Ellen.
Guess who's joining the Olympics?
- Guess who's joining the Olympics?
- Who?
- Me.
- Really?
- How is the love of my life?
- Can I borrow this?
Of course.
Which one is that?
Ohh.
My granddaughter and her boyfriend who won't marry her... are going to become art.
That's a limited access floor.
You need a swipe card.
Oh.
I'll just get off on two then.
You want the offices?
"- Actually, are you Nancy Herrington?"
- Yes.
Okay. 'Cause I wanted to show you my art.
I brought this tape I thought we could watch.
Okay.
Why don't you send it to this address.
"Oh, but that's here."
Can't I just hand it to you?
It'll get lost.
It's better if you send it.
- Lucky you.
Living with the Chase's.
- Yes.
Whoopty- do.
"If you guys are friends again, you don't have to conceal it."
I can take it.
You see that nurse right there?
She blames me.
She thinks that I brought the heart attack on... by my sexual demands.
"No, actually, my sexual commands."
What is it?
Good news?
What makes you think that?
"Actually, Andy is pretty much the same?"
But I thought that you... I was on my way to Allegheny Systems when I realized...
- l forgot the estimates.
- Here.
I can't believe I did this.
Anyway...
"Wait, here, here!"
- Graham!
This is beautiful!
- lt's a lemon- hazelnut tort.
- Thank you!
- When did you?
"I couldn't sleep, I was up waiting for you."
"Oh, my God, Patty."
- You waited up for me?
- Only until three.
I guess I'm going to be late for this meeting. I better phone him.
Your husband is an artist.
"Oh, God, I can't bear it."
That's what I'm counting on.
"Where do you want to go, hey?"
What do you want to see?
Rrr!
Argh!
Is that her?
The woman twice dead.
"She's rather pretty, isn't she?"
She's not possible.
"Right then, Clara Oswald."
Time to find out who you are.
This is so depressing.
I was almost married.
I was so close to being done.
"Living a life of no makeup, wearing flats, being on the bottom."
"Maybe I was wrong about marriage, it sounds awesome."
"Look, don't worry, Lil."
"I mean, it's normal to feel this way."
It's not normal to make us put on these dresses and sing Kanye West.
"But, you know what?"
Anything to help you get over Neal.
"Uh, uh, uh."
"I told you, no one is allowed to say ""the n word"""
in this apartment.
"Shouldn't no one say ""the n word,"" ever?"
Then we should probably stop singing Kanye West.
You know what?
I'm over it.
I'm not even thinking about it.
Someone pass me another Neal.
"Uh, I mean, a beer."
Look at him.
"He's like a cage fighter, all wiry and feral."
"- And rich too, don't forget."
- Ah... he's perfect.
If only he wasn't talking to your boyfriend.
What boyfriend?
"You do actually love Paul, don't you?"
"Honey, right now, I can't even remember his name."
"So what do you do, Justin?"
- I'm an Army man.
"- Wow, respect."
- Seen any combat?
- Afghanistan.
Three tours.
Can't seem to get enough of the blood and dust.
"So you're with Eleanor, right?"
"For my sins, yes."
"Though, I'm not..."
I'm not convinced it's going anywhere.
- And we've done it but considering I...
- Are you and Gemma an item?
- got back...
- Why?
You interested?
No.
"No, she's not my type."
She's right up Felix's street though.
"Yeah, right."
What's the joke?
You think she's too good for him?
"Well, he made a move at the end of summer term."
Didn't work out too well.

"Yo, what are you doing?"
Oh.
"Uh, helping to get your new roommate all settled in."
My new roommate?
No.
No.
"No, no, no, no, no..."
"Look, your mother doesn't want her in the house."
What am I supposed to do?
"I don't know... off the top of my head, maybe not bring home a little, tiny horse."
"Well, it's too late for that."
"I'd let her fall asleep first, if I were you."
"She does get a little randy in the evening, huh?"
See?
Good night.
(nickers)
"Come on, girl."
What is this?
"Oh, this was our wedding album."
These were photos of you and I pledging our love to one another.
Why would you try to eat it?
That hooved hussy did.
- (whinnies)
"- John,"
"I've tried to be patient, but this is a nightmare."
Welcome home.
Is that a friend?
Welcome home...?
This ship belongs to Mother.
Ohh...
How do you do?
Make yourself at home.
Thank you...
Thanks for the tea.
You're lucky to spend so much time in foreign countries!
Not really.
I'd rather live like you.
What do you mean?
"You probably fight on the front lines for world peace, don't you?"
Yeah.
For world peace...
How did you know that?
Oh... no...
Y-you...!
Yes.
You're right.
You're the one responsible for the kidnappings at our school.
I knew the Dangaioh pilots were disguising themselves as students at Ho'o Academy.
My cell phone...!
We didn't know who it belonged to.
What about the other girls?
Don't worry.
They're precious goods.
I wouldn't harm them.
Goods...?
But you're special...
What are you going to do with me?
I never should have let him stay.
I should have dragged him into that bus.
It's not your fault.
All that talk about death's sweet embrace.
You know what?
It's not sweet.
It hurts.
Did Gene have any allergies?
I can ask his mother.
Absinthe and wine are the only things Lexia drinks so it's all we serve.
"I've got to say I could go for a tequila every now and then, you know?"
"And Gene Hansen, what was he drinking the night he died?"
Absinthe.
Anything else?
Not that I know of.
Drugs?
In a nightclub?
Half the kids here are using.
Did Lexia know that?
She'd have to be blind not to.
"Yeah, she sure would."
Now this is truly a surprise.
"I need your help, detective."
I don't do parking tickets.
It's not about parking tickets.
Really?
"Well, you must want to know what to get Vicki for her birthday."
You know what?
"Between you and me, she really loves kitten posters."
This was a mistake.
"Hey, hey, Fitzroy, come on."
"Hey, come on."
Yeah.
It really is.
In a way.
"Oh, in every way."
I wanted a slightly different image so I thought maybe Bollywood Elvis would be good.
"I'd get a butler, but he can be an anteater and..."
my best friend's got four arms.
"Is it the next step from the Boosh, would you say?"
I think for me.
Julian wanted to go off and do some straight theatre and explore that.
I wanted to get hold of the animation side of it.
We'd the Moon and the 2D animation in the Boosh and I wanted to see how far you could take that.
So the guy that I work with did the Moon and animation in the Boosh.
And I met him at art school.
"The brief was to try to make the most psychedelic, weirdest show ever."
You've fulfilled your brief.
DOORBELL Oh!
"Noel, Noel..."
It's Noel's House Party!
I wonder who THIS could be.
CHEERING
Hello!
Look at you!
Hello.
..Sarah Harding!
Look at you.
Hi.
Look at this.
"You two know each other, I assume?"
"Yeah, well, kind of."
Yeah.
What does that mean?
"- Don't answer it, Stokes!"
- May I enquire why not?
"They're wearing dinner jackets, we've got to change."
"- Come on, James."
"- Very good, sir."
Answer the door and attend to them.
We'll be right down.
"Yes, Mr Twelvetrees."
"Oh, er, good evening."
"We're a bit early, I'm afraid."
"Oh, that's all right."
Come in.
(Door closes)
I'll take your hats and coats.
Nice weather we've been having.
I was saying to my wife this morning what nice weather we've been having.
- It rained last Thursday.
"-Yes, but apart from that."
- It didn't rain very much.
- No.
Came through my roof.
Nearly had the ceiling down.
I'm sure his lordship's maid doesn't want to hear our domestic problems.
"I don't mind, I'm very sympathetic."
"This way, please, and I'll announce you."
Just look at this place.
All got through the sweat of our labours.
"Don't start, Jock."
We've only just got through the door.
- Mr Foster.
"- (Cissy) Good evening, Mr Foster."
- Mr Barnes.
So you are.
Okay.
But I'm going to talk to her then.
"Danny, I could run away."
"After my party, I mean."
Maybe to San Francisco.
If you want to.
If I want to?
"Oh, little one, I'd run off to Anywhereland with you."
But I don't have any money.
That's easy.
I can't really have any of my money until they say I'm ready for it or something.
But I can get tickets on a plane.
I can charge them.
"After we're gone, she'll never know where to look for us."
"All right, Danny?"
"""All right, Danny?"""
"All right, Merle."
Who needs money?
"Anywhereland, here we come."
"No, silly."
I meant San Francisco.
I knew what you meant.
[chattering]
"Wait here for me, Corbett."
I'll only be a minute.
"Whatever you say, Miss."
[no audible dialogue]
Your conduct is absolutely disgraceful.
"If there is one thing I can't stand, it's a sneak."
Who told you?
"That's quite beside the point, Merle."
I'm so thirsty.
Life is so wonderful!
"Ah, Reinhold!"
"I'd like to introduce my friend, Count Casanova."
Let the count sit down.
"Count, these are three prize-winning beauties of Pankow."
Let me talk to my friend a minute.
"My dear Reinhold, I'm always so happy to see you."
You need another man?
You'd need a radiator to thaw that one out!
"- Shall I tickle you, darling?"
- Give us a smile!
- Pay no attention to them.
- You're quite the ladies' man.
"Scram for a while, girls."
These dames mean nothing to me.
"But at home I have a real pearl, a treasure, a jewel."
Why don't you bring her along?
"No, better to leave her home."
No need to drag women everywhere.
Of course!
What do you think?
Those crooks steal and cheat.
- Crooks?
And Franz frightens me too.
Franz?
He's done time too.
Tegel.
Four years.
Prison.
That's right ― Franz.
"I tell you, she's wonderful."
You don't have to be pushed by no foreigners.
There are a lot of guys in this town.
Americans who feel like you and me.
They've been giving this a lot of thought.
They can show you how to protect yourself.
Would you like to meet them?
Sure.
"But, Mr. Osgood, the stay-on lasts so much longer."
Heh-heh.
"Yeah, so I've heard."
- Anything else?
- No.
That'll be 50 cents.
Fifty cents?
For Ajax Shaving Cream?
I can buy it for 37 down the street at Molyneux's Cut Rate.
"Well, you better trade there then."
We don't cut nobody's prices or throats.
Molyneux's Cut Rate store.
"If you haven't got the stay-on kind, Mr. Osgood, I'll take this."
Milady Beautiful.
"Anything else, Mrs. Danvers?"
"Oh, a package of henna."
The good kind.
"How do you do, Mr. Taylor?"
- Hello.
"- Seen our friend, Eddie, these days?"
Yeah.
"You ain't gonna let him marry, are you?"
And why not?
"It's still a free country, ain't it?"
- That will be a dollar 39.
"Okay, this eye--"
"It doesn't open all the way because when I was little, my sister peed in it."
Tonight is your opportunity to go out there and change all of our minds.
What?
Where is Liz?
Liz?
!
Four minutes to air.
That's four minutes to air.
Is Liz back yet?
"No, which cat do you want Jenna to carry?"
I'm sorry?
Which cat?
Oh.
I want...that one.
"Jack Donaghy to the control room, please."
Jack Donaghy.
Peanut's not an actor.
I just--I just rescued him from a lab.
"Hey, Lemon, I'll drop you off."
Where do you live?
The studio.
I want you to drop me at the studio.
I want to tell Donaghey to his face that I quit.
"And I want to do it in front of the whole crew, so that they know he didn't fire me."
I wanna see that.
Gonna turn the lights down low.
It's almost time for the Girlie Show
"Ooh, ooh, pull over."
Pull over here.
"Tracy, I don't have time for this."
This is where I grew up.
Because they're more...
There are not so many cliques and...
- Why are you telling me?
- Would you like a glass of water?
"Helene, come here."
- Why are you telling me this?
- Because we have to decide.
"You don't need me any more, Helene."
"Everything is taken care of now, right?"
Anna and the boys...
I'll just slow you all down.
- Stop.
- No.
I'm the only one stopping for now.
I just mean...
Do you think you and Jacob will get together?
Do you?
Stop it.
I would like to know.
I just didn't want you to see me...
like this.
"This is only the beginning, Helene."
It will get worse from now on.
- Can you manage?
- Yes.
I'm so damned pathetic...
I don't want to...
I don't want to die!
"I don't, Helene."
"I don't want to, damn it!"
I don't want to die!
I don't!
We've already begun to evacuate the plant.
"Tony's here, all right."
Get me down.
"Thank you, thank you."
"Now, where are you going?"
In there.
"Oh, no."
You can't go beyond this point without IDs.
Tony!
- Tia!
- I knew it.
She'll spoil everything.
I can just taste that money.
We cannot let her take it away from us.
Tony!
"Tony, from this moment you will no longer hear Tia."
She cannot break through my power of control.
- Acknowledge.
"- Tony, what's wrong?"
"It's me, your sister."
Try to remember me.
Acknowledge.
Tony?
"- Yes, sir."
- Get those kids.
She'll use some of those molecules on us.
"I'll take care of her before she gets a chance, you get them."
I can't get through.
I don't know what they've done to his mind.
We've got to find the emergency cooling system ourselves.
How do you spell cooling?
Come on.
I have something you might wanna know before you go.
- I hope it doesn't have to do with Blair.
- It has to do with you.
"About Santorini, what you were looking for."
While I was on the trip you so graciously gave me I found it again.
"Only it's not in Santorini anymore, it's in Fiji."
At least he was last week.
You found my father?
Get in.
Let's go.
Why aren't you in Europe?
I was in Paris but only to get your favorite macaroons from Pierre Hermé.
And Germany?
To pick up your favorite Falke stockings.
You know how I adore them.
"- What are you doing here, then?"
- You were right.
"I was a coward, running away again."
But everywhere I went you caught up with me.
So I had to come back.
I wanna believe you.
But I can't.
- You've hurt me too many times.
- You can believe me this time.
That's it?
I love you too.
But can you say it twice?
[LAUGHING]
"No, I'm serious, say it twice."
CHUCK:
I love you.
I love you.
Cash or charge?
- Cash.
- [Woman] Cash is $54.
- Right.
Okay.
Please print your name on both tickets before you board the plane.
Yeah.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Have a nice flight.
"- Yes, sir?"
"- Round trip to Washington, please."
[Car Door Closes]
So?
"So everything's going great, terrific, beautiful."
I'll need a few more days though.
The boys think we oughta cool it for a while... just to make sure there's no heat.
You must take me for an imbecile.
Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?
I haven't spent five minutes in New York City... without the company of a policeman.
"Look, I'm leveling with you."
I need a little more time.
It's just that my people think we oughta find a better time to make the switch.
- That's all.
- It has to be by the end of this week.
"Look, Charnier."
You got to be reasonable.
It's your problem.
"Well, it's your problem too."
It's so nice to have seen you again.
[Speaking French]
[French]
"You go to Sanchun with Jaesa, Mugol and Mukguh."
(Sanchun)
Do you know who Buwiyum is?
Do you know who Buwiyum is?
(Magok)
See what's going on.
"Yes, sir."
Commander.
Oi.
What's going on?
Okjuh soldiers are gathering young men to wipe out the pirates.
Then the pirates will be well-hidden.
We've got our work cut out.
Let's go into town for now.
OK.
Stop there!
Let's go.
Aren't they Sachooldo's Jega?
They wouldn't be here unless it's something important.
I heard Prince Daeso summoned them.
Prime Minister.
Do you have any idea what it's about?
How have you been?
I heard you're doing a good job in place of the late Maga.
Thank you.
I trust you will all help Puyo overcome this crisis.
We will serve you with all our heart.
Thank you.
I'll give you a chance to do just that.
I've summoned you all here to tell you to prepare for a war.
A war?
What war?
- Ah!
Treat this with care.
It's loaded with live crabs.
Shh.
I told 'em I was taking 'em to the circus.
Why'd you take your footlocker?
What's a beach party without beach?
[ Chuckling ]
- ?
[ Lively ] - [ All Chattering ]
What a terrific idea!
These crabs are delicious.
Sure are.
And the best part's right here... inside the little first baseman's mitt.
You two are lucky Klinger came through... or you'd be skinny-dipping in that kettle.
"Oh, you're right."
Underestimating Klinger's become a national pastime.
"Thank you, sirs."
Hate to eat and run.
But I've got to pack for three days... and a fun-filled trip in Seoul.
"Okay, I've had some fresh air."
Can we go back now?
"No, not quite yet."
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
"What are we doing here, Doctor?"
I don't want a drink.
Good.
Because you're not gonna get one.
What the hell is this all about?
"Please, David."
- I'm sure you've heard of these.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Do you want me to stay?
I can sleep on the couch.
I've done it before.
"No, I have to learn to be alone."
Hello.
"- Hello, everyone."
- Good morning.
Washing her hair?
What do you think?
- How was the night?
- Normal.
"Give me that, I'll do it."
I'm off.
- So long.
"- Bye, Matilde."
It's so hot!
We should cut her hair.
Cut it short.
It's more practical and comfortable.
We'll leave it like it was when she arrived here.
So it won't look different if she awakes.
"After four years in a coma, it would be a miracle."
I believe in miracles.
And so should you.
- Why me?
- Because you really need them.
"One could happen to you, and you wouldn't even realize."
"God, it's so hot!"
I bought something in the drugstore to help stop the perspiration stains on my uniform.
Your armpits don't sweat but the rest...
Mr. Gold?
Hi.
Peter said you were here.
Shouldn't you be in synagogue?
Uh... no.
How are you feeling?
- Better.
- Good.
Then I won't feel bad about saying this.
Your son is going to lose.
"Without Alicia, he will lose the governorship."
"Uh, I-I don't know..."
"She was on our side, Jackie."
"Alicia was offering to help Peter, then you got involved."
How did I get involved?
This friggin' house!
Good job.
God bless you son.
When do you think you'll be here?
"Dad, please."
"I beg you, don't..."
We're going to introduce you to a nice girl.
"Dad, what could I possibly do there?"
"Apply for your military service, and come back to Urfa."
"Your past, your future, your destiny..."
It's all here...
He doesn't care.
Why couldn't you ask about the police station?
Why didn't you make him come back?
I'll find a way.
He's got little left to finish.
While we eat shit there?
She just be drinking--
She--
Got little kids running past her with quarters and nickels.
"""Make a wish, man!"
"Make a wish."""
I'm sorry.
It's about an authoritative tone.
That's how I know that Jay-Z is not gonna be able to control Blue Ivy when she gets older.
His voice is too light.
"And first of all, Jay-Z's voice, man, it's just so fun."
"If he was outside of a haunted house, it would be hilarious."
"He'd be trying to warn people about what's going on in the haunted house, he'd be..."
"""Yo, don't go in there."
"There's a ghost in there."""
"""Jeah, eh, eh, eh."""
"¶ Jeah, gather 'round hustlers ¶"
¶ That's if you still living.
"¶ And get on down to that oh, eh, eh, HOV ¶"
"""Look."
"""Okay, you wanna go in there?"
"""You serious?"
"""Okay, you're dead."
Bye-bye.
"""Fuck you."
"Ha ha ha ha, yep."""
"""Yep!"""
"""Solange is in there."
"Be careful."""
"Blue Ivy, man."
That don't even sound like a real name.
"That sound like stripper lotion, don't it?"
"""Girl, I don't never go down the pole"
- Passports.
I left my jacket.
What did you say about passports?
- I had the jacket when I was at the table.
Did you leave passports there?
"I'm sorry, sire."
We left the passports.
- Thing?
"Christ, you will know now that we have lied."
You've been drinking all night.
- We have to get out of this way
And leave the Balkans.
Believe me when I say
"That it is best not to make him piss, that guy."
I can assure you that there will be heels.
"So, are we now pursued by a crazy Turkish and a crazy Serbian?"
The quickest way to go is to cross the sea to Italy.
But there is another border.
Montenegro.
Let's go.
I drive.
Sire?
Ludovic?
I am very ashamed.
I know.
I have to resign.
"No, Ludovic."
"He served me well, I count on her."
I failed completely.
"No, nothing at all."
Sire.
Here is the frontier.
"That's not the point, Cookie."
"The point is, what do you do with him?"
"You tip your mitt and the jerries pull him out of here and plant him in some place else, like Stalag 16 or 15."
Or you kill him off and the Krauts kill off the whole barracks.
Every one of us.
"So, what do you do?"
Who is it?
"If you don't want to tell me, why don't you tell Hoffy or Security?"
Yeah.
Security.
What's keeping Hoffy?
- Why don't we get any news about Dunbar?
-He'll be back.
They got no proof.
"Come on, boys."
Soft and sweet.
Beguile me.
Betty.
Betty.
Betty.
Betty.
"May I have this dance, miss?"
"Why, sure."
"Pinch me, darling."
"Pinch me, so I'll know I'm not dreaming."
"Thank you, darling."
I love you
I love you
Three words that are divine
"And now, my dear I'm waiting to hear"
The words that make you mine
Did anyone ever tell you you had the most beautiful legs in the world?
"Whatever you do, they will take him away."
"No, he won't go to the army."
He will go like the rest of us.
"No, he won't!"
Yourprecious son...
You're precious too.
How many letters in your name?
Five.

"Come, rest now."
I thought I was getting a boy and he turned out to be a girl...
"Mom, pass me a beer."
Pick seven cards please.
"For you sweety, I'll pick 14."
What the hell are you doing here?
Ahhh!
I just came to have my fortune told.
Also to apologize forthat night...
Whatever.
Take your ass downstairs and get yourfortune told there.
"Once the cup is lifted, it has to be read."
"Yourfortune is dark, complicated."
Some guy is after you.
And also a foreign guy.
What's this constant money talk?
You end up dancing at a bar.
C'mon really?
I don't like dancing.
What exactly do you see?
"I see your mom's pussy, right here."
"Sorry, here is someone to see you."
"You got a ""D"" on your math test?"
You don't get D's.
"Eh, what are you gonna do?"
"I'll tell you what you're gonna do, Brick."
You're gonna study.
Math is very important in life.
You use math in everything...
"Oh, even I can't say it like I believe it."
Hey.
Hey.
"Look at this... a ""D."""
"- Axl, get in here!"
- This is Brick.
Really?
"What happened, buddy?"
You don't get D's.
We're kinda counting' on you to pull up the family average.
I'm reading at an eighth grade level.
Why can't I please you people?
!
Just reading isn't gonna get you into college.
"Oh, I'm not going to college."
I've decided to live with you guys forever.
Forever.
"Well, mike, you know what this means, don't ya?"
"Oh, jeez."
We're gonna have to help Brick with his homework.
"In our house, helping with homework"
Is something that's never gone well.
Write it down.
Write it down.
Why aren't you writing it down?
Spare me!
Spare me!
Get off the horse.
Move it!
These are the few we just caught?
What do they have with them?
Silk and red jade.
"Compared to those,"
I think these scums here are worth more.
They look tough.
-Take them away.
-Yes.
Hey hey hey.
Watch it.
What's on your mind?
Eh?
Nothing.
What Prince Ju-Mong has found out... don't you wish to know?
I don't place high hopes on that.
"Now, it seems no one can come up with something good."
The reason I gave him two days is because I know this expedition means a lot to him.
"For us,"
We can always leave it to next time.
"But for Prince Ju-Mong, he can't do the same."
"Compared to the acknowledgement I want from Father,"
Prince Ju-Mong's need of King Geum-Wa's acknowedgement far outweighs mine.
Looks like the scale has tipped.
What do you mean by that?
You used to treat Prince Dae-So and Ju-Mong equally.
Now it seems you're leaning closer to Prince Ju-Mong.
"What you've said, I can't deny."
How should I put it?
"The horn doesn't help, does it?"

"So, I've narrowed it down to"
Swiss Coffee and Whispering White.
But I can't decide between matte or satin.
I thought we landed on Eggshell.
We decided against Eggshell.
W-why don't we just sell the house?
Why don't we just paint the floor Eggshell
- since that's what I'm walking on.
- Okay.
- I forgot to give this to you.
"- Oh, thank you."
"- Have a good day at school, sweetie."
"- Bye, sweetie."
It's fourth grade.
We're all just treading water.
What is it?
"Ah, well, it's... it's from the principal's office."
- Is she in trouble?
- (door closes)
No!
She's... smart.
- She is?
- That's what it says.
Are you sure it's not for Lily Rosen?
You were at that science fair.
She brought that frog back to life!
This is for our Lily.
T-they're suggesting that she skip fifth grade and go right into middle school next year.
"""Lily is testing far above her grade level..."
- What?
- I'm gonna eat in the car and then...
"- No, no, no, no, no."
"No, no, no."
"Give it, give it!"
Do you know what I was doing right before I almost died?
Exactly what you're doing.
Humoring a relative?
"No, no, scheduling my life down to the last minute."
"I mean, look at this..."
"""Call New York office... 4:17 P.M."""
Do you realize that everybody but us rounds up to the nearest five minutes?
"Today made me realize something, Mitchell."
"No, I don't want to be a 4:17 kind of person."
- Do you?
"- Yes, I do."
'Cause that phone call needs to be done by 4:23 so that I am not a dead man by 4:41.
Give me my phone.
- Nope.
Nope.
No.
- Give me...
Claire.
We're gonna do something together.
"Yes, take the rest of the day off."
- I can't do that.
"- Yes, you can."
I did!
"Yeah, 'cause you work for your father."
"- No, no, no, we need this, Mitchell."
"- Hey, come on, give me my..."
- We really need this.
"- Claire, I'm really swamped today, and I..."
"Odds are, that's what got him killed."
"Look, I love a gruesome murder as much as the next girl, but we don't have a client."
And impressing that ridiculous detective society isn't exactly on the top of my list.
"Well, it's on mine."
"But first, let's see if anyone knows what I was doing here a year and a half ago."
Yeah.
This is definitely the place.
Andrew:
Two for lunch?
[Shouting in Korean]
The watch.
Richard.
What's going on?
You were here 18 months ago.
"Uh, yeah."
It's my place.
So?
Do you recognize him?
"No, should I?"
"Uh, I was here about, um..."
[Speaks Korean]
I was here about a year and a half ago.
Something happened.
You yelled at me.
"Oh, you're the guy with the watch."
What watch?
You...
You couldn't pay.
And then I was gonna call the cops on you.
"And then, uh, you..."
you gave me your watch to hold onto.
"Said you were gonna come back for it, but you never came."
"Come, let's sleep."
"No, I'll not come."
"Come Prakash, it'll be warm."
"You mean, are you that type?"
Yuck!
Our 'friendship' is broken.
Oh broken!
"What type are you, man?"
My patient likes to undress himself and I like to undress others.
Don't you wear brief?
Door is locked!
How come I got stuck here?
"Prakash, come."
Your cheeks are like sausages.
Bommali!
I'll not leave you.
Mother Jejamma!
You've to save me!
Mother!
Did you show him stars?
"I didn't show him anything, in fact he showed me everything."
They are not ordinary people.
What happened?
Asking me what had happened?
One sleeps without any clothes and another doesn't like others wearing clothes.
"I beg you dear, please shift me from that room."
- Why?
They are other 'type' of people.
Yuck!
What the hell are you saying?
"Stay with them for a night, you'll know it."
He's a sex maniac!
Think maybe she arranged to duck out and meet him somewhere else?
She just went down to get me some more coffee.
Millie's Barbecue.
Maybe that's around on the other road.
I was beginning to think you wouldn't come.
"Edie, always I come when you need me."
"Axel, I've so much to explain to you."
"No, no."
Not now.
I-
"- I only wanted to help you, but I did everything wrong."
I should have told you in the beginning.
I don't want to hear.
"Come, get into the car."
I have money.
Come.
- What?
- And no one will catch us.
"And whatever has happened, I don't want to know."
Come.
[Mason] Axel.
So.
Who tells you where to find us?
Never mind that.
"Axel, as your attorney--"
You stay out of this.
"Well, they can't have her."
Somers he was no good.
"Take it easy, Mr. Norstaad."
It's not the lady I'm arresting for murder.
It's you.
"Now, Mr. Pedersen, we've heard testimony that on the afternoon of Somers' murder,"
"It's late, why do you come?"
"Miss Shui, Chan Mon-gut is a real creep."
"I've followed him for decades, he treats me badly too."
Don't you think he will be nice to you instead?
Any other thing else?
Miss Shui...
You are old enough to get married.
Take this piece ofjade.
Come on.
Go in and get some clothes.
"Follow me to Hong Kong, will you?"
You...
No?
"It's a long road to Hong Kong, take this piece ofjade with you."
"If you meet the bandits, you still have something valuable, thus they won't kill you."
"It's late, better go now."
Take care.
Master.
Where is the guy who sold this piece ofjade?
"None of my business, I don't know shooting."
I didn't kill!
I didn't kill...
I didn't kill!
Go!
I am innocent!
Go in.
Foreigner?
You murderer!
"Uncle, what did he scold me?"
No...
Help!
Are you going to torture me?
Ah!
That's it!
That's it!
A loudspeaker in the shop!
Just like they have in supermarkets.
-
- Where are you going?
-
- With regular announcements to customers.
A speaker pointing that way so it'll reach the people in the street.
Where's he going?
Come back.
Don't leave me here.
"Look, don't..."
Will you...
Don't!
Aghh!
Don't leave me!
"Granville, get me that yellow screwdriver."
Don't worry about it.
It's only been two or three days.
You'll be walking fine in a couple of years.
Don't know what took you so long to get me out.
I've got a business to run.
I can't afford to spend time opening errand boys!
(GRANVILLE GROANS)
There you are.
Think where your trendiness has got you.
I brought you up to be a normal lad and suddenly you go bent.
I know you're trying to talk me out of it.
I'm not going to be talked...
Ow!
All checked?
We've interviewed eight.
We're on to the other two.
We've searched from Cape Wrath to Carlisle.
He hasn't got a roof over his head.
You're on Storm Island.
- Storm Island?
- Now you know how it got its name.
You were swept into the bay.
Everything always is.
"Please, don't get up."
- I've frightened your little girl.
- He's a boy.
- I'm sorry.
- No.
I must cut his hair.
Was anyone else on board with you?
"David, we really must put the poor man to bed."
"No, I was alone."
Didn't you bother to get a weather report before you left?
No.
- Did you notify the coastguard?
"- David, what does it matter?"
"Because if he did, there may be men out there risking their lives looking for him."
- And we can let them know that he's safe.
- No.
I...
I...
I did not notify the coastguard.
I'll just turn the bed down.
- I've never seen anybody so exhausted.
"- But, Mummy..."
They love him.
"Sorry, I have to go into the garden."
"We don't have anything important to discuss, do we?"
Why don't you come back tonight at 8.
They'll be asleep then.
Don't I get to wear a hat?
You look way too healthy for a 60 year old.
I bet you still exercise.
-Yes.
I think you're afraid of getting old.
-That's nonsense.
You still live in the past.
"-Not at all, I look ahead."
To tomorrow.
-Tomorrow doesn't exist.
"For you, tomorrow is a repetition of yesterday."
That's nonsense.
I take my responsibility.
Because I've not forgotten everything that's happened.
I'm prepared for what's coming.
What's that?
The next war?
It will always be different from the previous one.
Useless.
"We're simply getting old, you and I."
But I accept it and you don't.
The war was your heyday.
And you want that back.
I'm out.
Then I'll do it alone.
Your son?
-Yes.
And you felt as if they were coming after you?
- And I started to run...
- But?
And then...
I don't know what happened.
You did something.
I think so.
GUARD:
"This way, folks."
Come down this way as quickly as you can.
SECOND GUARD:
"All right, folks, calmly."
This way.
"Quickly as you can, please move down."
Just follow them.
Thank you.
Right through the barricades there.
That's right.
Do you wanna know what I'm worried about?
I wanna know who's gonna feed my cats.
We'll all be out of here soon.
You'll be home to feed them yourself.
And what if that doesn't happen?
"Relax, Dorothy."
The aliens'll feed 'em.
"Yeah, they're old friends of your cats, right?"
What?
What are you looking at?
"You really think if you're cruel enough to other people, all your own misery will go away?"
No.
Just keeps my mind off it for a while.
RAY:
Mineral water?
"-Yes, I'm trying to stay fit."
Sports and stuff.
You're quite comfortable here.
Yes.
"I'm not an ambulant patient, but a drinking patient."
Keep it that way.
Thank you.
-There's nothing wrong with me.
I came her on my own initiative.
I worked hard lately.
No holiday in three years.
That's how it goes when you own a big business.
Cheers.
-Cheers.
My wife and I were going to go on a cruise.
For our 25th wedding anniversary.
"I was at your wedding, remember?"
-Yes.
But I didn't feel well.
My wife told me to see a specialist before we went on the cruise.
A ship's doctor only knows about sailors' dicks.
"Yes, indeed."
I'll add something after all.
-Of course.
What did they say here?
All good.
A young God with pure blood in his jenever vessels.
I can go home in an hour if I want.
It was a false alarm.
They just told me.
My wife will be so happy.
We will film our return journey for people.
And that's that.
What do we do at Atomium?
Mr. Lloyd?
"Come on, let's go."
"To tell the truth, I did not expect the king to endorse my plan."
But we had to leave Turkey and return to the EU.
"Here we are, with a woman dressed as a king who reflected on the concept of freedom."
"Please, do you have to do it right now?"
"Yeah I have to, I'm itchy."
It's unbearable.
I'm almost done.
But what is it?
Maybe it's the shock of the news.
The secession of Wallonia.
Think about how it feels.
Do you know that we have many French words in Bulgarian?
Really?
"- Yes, how..."
Lift.
Bidet.
"I want to show her Mascia, Ivana and Pavlina."
My three daughters.
Three daddy.
"- Stay silent, Ana."
Do you have children?
No.
All right.
"He still has time, he's a man."
Made in Istanbul.
It's better than the Bulgarian ones.
I keep it.
What are you two zibs doing?
"You should be more careful with this, sir."
What the hell?
"Are you trying to lift my card, asshole?"
"Hey, he's not an asshole."
You're the asshole.
"My God, an American eagle."
"Go, go, go!"
He's coming!
- I know!
I know!
"- Go, go, go!"
"- I'm going, I'm going!"
"- Go, go!"
- Okay!
"- Turn, turn, turn!"
- I'm turning!
- God!
That did not go well!
I know!
I was there!
"His big hobby, his passion is darts."
- Yeah.
"- No, he's in a darts league that competes every Friday at a pub called St. James's Well."
Am I the only one who thinks there's something off about this job?
The only thing off is Maddie's focus.
"Give me a break, Max."
"Maddie, I want to make something very clear."
This job happens to be of special interest to the Doctor.
Max is just freaking out 'cause I had coffee and talked to some guy at a coffee shop.
"No, it's the way that you were talking to him that concerns me."
"You know what, Sal?"
You wish to bury your fiancé?
Go there and find him.
I will wait while you dig.
(FLIES BUZZING)
This is the journey your father has sent you on.
No.
This is where it ends.
Your old life is over now.
"You have only a new one, with me."
Do you desire it?
"If not, I will leave you here, to lie with him."
Make your choice.
Tahir...
No.
Please just wait.
Don't.
Please...
Choose.
STONEBRIDGE:
Here.
"Pull back here, aim, pull the trigger."
Yeah?
You're not afraid I might use this on you?
"If you can find your daughter without me, go ahead."
He's doing what?
Get me satellite surveillance on a 50-mile grid around the exchange point.
Where's Scott?
SINCLAIR:
I've had to bring him back to Khartoum.
That bloody journalist woman.
He took a bullet to the spleen.
He's lost a lot of blood.
I've ordered an MRI.
"Don't be silly, Christine."
Only the Chief of Neuro can order an MRI.
You know that.
"That's not true, actually."
What do you mean?
I did it.
At 7:10 this morning.
I signed off on the paperwork.
Surely not in Steg's name?
How do I know what it looked like to the tech on duty?
"Come on, Brenda."
Kingdom Hospital Neuro can't grind to a halt because Steg oversleeps.
Don't look at him.
"Hey, Doc, you're losing it."
"What's up, Doc?"
You should be sterilized.
At least then you couldn't breed.
"Hey, you forgot something, Doc."
Maintenance.
This is where I work.
"Will you try to remember that, Mama?"
"Yes, Bobby."
"You're a bit of a crackpot, I guess."
But I'm very fond of you.
"- I have some work to do up here, so..."
"- Honey, don't worry about me."
I'll be fine.
I know my way around this place like the back of my hand.
"- Mr. Goode, I'd like to report..."
- Johnny's not here.
- I'm just holding down the seat for him.
Gas trucks.
Nice touch.
( tyres screech )
( cell phone rings )
( rings )
Answer it.
Yes?
It's for you.
Sit down.
Yeah?
Okay.
I see you.
What do I want?
How about a world cruise and a winning lottery ticket?
( chuckles )
Why don't you come up here?
We can talk about it.
Just you.
Your little friends can wait down there.
"Hey, sit down."
What do you think you're doing?
I'm gonna get some ice for my neck because you hurt me.
"And tomorrow morning, after the FBI either lock you up or shoot you dead,"
"I'm gonna have to get up and go to work like any other day, and I'd just as soon do that looking as fresh and pretty as possible."
"Get some water for Charlie, will you please, Cynthia?"
CYNTHIA:
Yeah.
Anybody else?
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.
Thanks.
"We got to get him out of here, Ray."
- Lucy Coleson.
- I can't believe that you...
Me either.
"Look at our son over there, eh?"
- He's perfect.
"- Yeah, and then you come along"
- and you expose him to all this...
- Me?
I'm just...
"I mean, what gives him the right to‐‐to touch you like that?"
‐ Like what?
"‐ You know what I mean, like he owns you."
"‐ Hey, hey, I'm here with you, and this is where I want to be, okay?"
Please come back to bed.
‐ It is not okay.
‐ It is not okay.
It's never gonna be okay.
Ah.
"I got it, okay."
I just‐‐
I got it.
It's...
‐ For you.
‐ Last night... ‐ We all made mistakes.
Myself included.
"I got us into this financial mess, and when I had an opportunity to help get us out,"
"I, uh..."
I‐I handled it poorly.
I‐I handled it poorly.
But I've been thinking and making alternate plans.
There are people we can reach out to to call on before we let the counsel know.
"‐ I could turn you in, for Silas."
"- Just take it easy, take-take it easy."
"- Justin, don't!"
- Don't what?
Do this?
This is what happens when people don't follow orders.
"Luke, chairs, bring them."
Do it!
"Justin, I don't know what it is you think we've done but really, you've got this wrong, all wrong."
We haven't done anything.
- You need to stop this.
"- Gemma, quiet."
Eleanor!
Gemma!
Take a seat.
"This is it, isn't it?"
This is why we're here?
I said take a seat.
Luke!
Their hands.
Bind them.
"No phone calls, people."
Use some bloody common sense.
"Luke, bring over the other chairs."
Snap to it!
Then collect up their car keys and their mobile phones.
There's a lock box on the workbench.
Chris...
"I know you're waiting, mate."
Picking the right moment.
This is not that moment.
I'm quicker than you and I've got a gun.
"And, uh, I absolutely won't miss."
They're forgotten in an hour.
Come on.
"Hey, Norman, you know what?"
"There's a place I know that I'd like to show you, that no one knows about."
Not even you.
It's my secret place.
I know every spot within three miles of Peyton Place.
Not this one.
Come on.
You were right.
I never knew this place was here.
I don't think anybody does but me.
And maybe God.
And now you.
It's beautiful.
I've just decided.
This is the last time I'm ever going to come here.
Why?
"Oh, I'm gonna leave it for somebody else to find."
Maybe your children will discover it.
I'm never going to marry.
I'm just going to have lovers.
"Oh, Allison."
What's wrong with that?
"No children to grow up unhappy, nobody gets hurt except maybe me."
That's the worst kind of emotional maladjustment.
Who said so?
- A book I read.
- What book?
I sent for a book.
"It was $ 1.98, in a plain wrapper."
- A plain wrapper?
I don't know no Paula.
What's this?
What's this thing here?
"You're ill, Mr. Biberkopf."
Your head and arm were injured.
I want outta here.
I have my work!
I have things to do!
Soon.
What's going on here?
What's wrong with me?
I have to get your particulars.
"You don't mind, do you?"
Let's see.
You were run over on May 12 on the Eberswalderstrasse.
Name:
Franz Biberkopf.
Auto accident.
"Did you step in front of the car, or what?"
"No, no."
Watch closely.
I'll demonstrate once more.
Here's the perfect rubber band for a gentleman.
"It won't snap, split or break."
Made from the very best materials.
The whole family could hang from this rubber band.
"Pull that end, young man."
Harder!
It won't bounce back like a bad check!
So you're not married.
No children either?
Sorry ― dumb question.
"We just told you we,re not!"
Not unhappy at all?
"I mean, it,s not always easy, but -"
"So you,re not unhappy."
Sometimes.
What do I check?
"I don,t know."
"Put ,slightly unhappy, if you want."
"I don,t want anything."
"It,s up to you."
What do you want?
"She doesn,t know and neither do I!"
"Don,t check anything!"
Fine.
"Then we,re done."
"Good, we,re done."
"Let,s have a drink."
How about having a drink with us?
Lights!
Are you allowed during work hours?
"It,s not that."
"We,re way behind schedule."
Whatever you Iike.
Our door is always open.
Thanks.
Another time.
"Listen, we were wondering:"
How did you end up working here?
"- You think it,s weird?"
"- I,m not criticizing."
"It,s just... you dissect people, examine them, manipulate them."
"We don,t manipulate anyone."
"- Wait, do--"
"If anyone comes in, just act like you're working or something."
"Wait, mike."
"Mikey, where are you?"
"- Hey, what's up?"
"- Get over here, will you?"
I got too many irons.
"Go right over there, give the ceiling a pull, will you?"
Basic business principles went right down the drain on this thing.
You're fired!
Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd
Keep doing the exercises and take three of the supplements a day.
It really should help your back.
"Yeah, I'm gonna be back in the office today."
"Okay, great."
Bye.
You're going back to work?
"Well, we talked about this."
It's been a month.
You said you were ready.
But if...
"oh, no, no."
"Right, right."
You're right.
You're right.
You should go back to work.
"Hey, I put down the new rug."
"Oh, good."
Do you like it?
'Cause I can get something else.
It's fine.
I don't know.
But we can't go back.
I need to um see my guests.
Can we talk?
Always.
Is something wrong?
I know you have high aspirations for me
So in the spirit of full disclosure
There's something you need to know
Something that may... it may come out.
I'm intrigued.
Last summer...
I had an affair
With an older woman.
Oh my boy.
Welcome to washington.
She was married at the time.
Go on.
And she...
Well she paid me.
Well...
Whatever happens i'll protect you.
Let's hope it doesn't come out.
Yeah.
Have you seen your girlfriend?
- You don't know?
- What?
Blair and i broke up.
This party is not so hot.
There's a killer doughnut place around the corner.
Can you guys believe gossip girl?
"""the--the insider""?"
"Thank you, Bobby."
- You working for us tonight?
- I'm filling in for Sweet.
- I guess she's starting to show.
- What do you know?
- What's new?
- Nothing much.
Same as usual.
"You not working at The Vanya, anymore?"
There's been shootings in the bar.
I'm happy not to be working there.
It's way too intense.
That's Disciples turf.
What's going on over there?
There's an American crew moving in.
Trying to shove out the Disciples and grab the street game.
"- American crew, huh?"
- That's what I heard.
- See you later.
I'll buy you a drink.
- For sure.
I saw the news about the shooting in Seattle.
It's so crazy in the States with the guns and everything.
I know.
I'll talk to you later.
I wanna know if you've talked to this guy.
Is he still in town?
I'm supposed to be meeting him any time.
"I wanna know who he is, who he's working for and what his plan is."
"This is happening now, so I'm gonna talk to you later."
It's Rene.
What happened with Reardon the other night?
Didn't you get my letter?
Yes.
Your message was clear indeed...
between the lines.
- I will defend my position.
"- Oh, balls!"
You're not in the army any more.
"You had an affair, not a pitched battle."
"Oh, Mallefille."
Poor boy.
It won't hurt for long.
- I know it must seem unfair.
- George.
- You promised to love me.
- I didn't promise to succeed.
- Whom did you come here to meet?
- No-one.
Help me off with my boots.
He should write his epitaph because I'm going to kill him!
Your rival is imaginary!
"If you're not going to help, go and find somewhere to sleep and leave me!"
"Make that two epitaphs, because I'll kill you if I find..."
"Oh, my God, you're hurt!"
You're bleeding.
Yes.
Be a dear.
Ask Ursula if she's got something for a bandage.
Of course.
Don't move.
No.
(LOCK CLICKS)
Bastard!
"No, I can't forget him."
That's what I thought.
I knew that very well.
But he doesn't live in our world.
Right?
That's not true!
Are you saying that when you're dancing with me it's like dancing with Kayama-san?
That's crazy.
"Hey, should I wait for you?"
Wait?
That's...
Perhaps I shouldn't have mentioned it here and now.
I'm not thinking about getting married now.
You didn't like the way I said it?
"No, that's not it."
"It's just that when I see my mother and father,"
I feel nervous about marriage.
Can't you help your mother?
My mother's problems go beyond the problems in our family.
I'm my mother's unfulfilled dream.
I'll taking care of your dancing.
But marriage is frightening to me.
I have the feeling that I'll end up like my mother.
Oh!
"Shinako, when did you get here?"
"Hello there, NMzu-san."
Did you see Kayama-sensei?
No.
He got sick and went somewhere.
I met Tomoko.
Tomoko?
How is she?
Mikhail.
Are you crazy?
What the hell are you thinking coming in here?
The key wasn't in the mailbox 'cause Darlene didn't show up tonight... so I don't get a break for another 20 minutes.
Here.
You might as well take it now.
You shouldn't have come!
You should've looked for the key later.
What's the matter?
You all right?
- Excuse me.
- Alex.
You probably gave half of those bent- nose guys up there a heart attack.
I'm surprised we weren't trampled on the way to the phone.
You better get outta here.
I'll see you soon as I get off.
Don't even think about going to sleep.
We got a lot of catching up to do.
Just tell me.
Is everything going to be okay?
Get outta here!
You need to go back inside.
Lvan wants to talk to you.
We were family!
You betrayed us.
Enough.
Enough!
This is your lucky day.
Get in!
That was dynamite.
Any of those guys Alex Bohemia?
Good.
"You're like me, it's all in front."
Be thankful you don't have to struggle into a roll-on.
I am!
Have you given up answering that intercom?
I didn't hear it.
It didn't buzz.
"My wife says can you get this stitched for Hilary, she says it's the band on the inside."
Who's this?
My name's Baker.
Blackfriars Assurance.
"We're insured, so sayonara."
"No, I just popped in to see Miss Sutcliffe."
"Well, you can pop out."
She's busy.
Goodbye.
"Bye, Pauline."
These need doing.
"Give me a knock in ten, and we'll make a move."
So...
What?
Mr Tubby Baker.
Very nice.
Very gentlemanly.
He's a gentleman caller
Like in that play where she had the gammy leg and the glass animals.
Why did you give him the brush-off?
We have our site visits on a Tuesday.
I've heard that something very exciting is happening the day after Tuesday.
What?
Wednesday.
Get a bit of a romance going.
I'd have him.
Ayushman you're doing the wrong thing.
What are you doing?
I am doing my duty... and now I'm going to sc***wyou.
- Ayushman you...
- Hold on.
What?
What?
You...
You think Dimple's apart of my plan.
Is that what you think?
You are right.
She is part of my plan.
She sleeps with me every night.
So she can at least do this much Boss.
That reminds me...
Look... let's forget what you think.
Think about what your brother's dilemma... when he finds out.
Kurukshetra.
The Boss' land of destiny.
He's honored and respected here.
I'll get areal kick out of this.
When I'll defame your brother using you.
I'll humiliate you but he'll feel ashamed.
That's why they say...
People defame death.
Life... makes you suffer.
This is the second time I hit anyone.
And both the times it was you only you.
I was scared since the moment I learnt...
Shiv's going outwith you.
Now he's paying forit.
Behind bars.
That's for you.
"You, at least you don't kill."
My woman.
My cross.
My skin.
Anything else you want?
"Shoo, or do you want a bow on top too?"
"No, I'll go to her!"
"Don't sweat, she's here!"
It's done!
"Hold me against you, against him, against me."
"Stop me from running out, from drowning."
Plug me.
Whatever floats your boat...
Life is good.
Can you smell it?
Take a breath!
"They watered the street, to make us grow on the paving."
"Yes, I do love you."
We've got everything!
"Our weaknesses,"
"Ideas,"
History!
"But what's keeping us on our asses, waiting for the Cossacks to strike?"
The burden of Money?
The phantoms of Culture?
The Final Solution?
"If we don't turn to face the Cossacks, it might hurt a little, get me?"
In '44 we won the Battle of the Rails.
The Final Solution?
Stale bourgeoisie farts.
"We need to take the middle ground, the power of living people, the workers."
Serving drinks to the meanie moms or watching Marly's husband massage your gums with his tongue?
"I know, I'm sorry."
I should have locked the door.
Yeah.
That's pretty much the only thing that was wrong with it.
"You know, I'm not Marly's biggest fan, but she really doesn't deserve this."
"Yeah, I know."
"It's wrong, it's wrong."
But I hope that you and I can still be friends.
"Yeah, I don't think so."
Why?
Because I'm Portuguese?
Because I'm a maid?
"Uh, no."
"It's because, well you're kind of a whore."
"- So, what's up for tomorrow?"
"- Well, we should definitely get together."
"I could swing by, maybe we'll catch a movie."
Great.
- I don't want to.
"- Oh, thank God."
"When you were married, we spent about three and a half hours alone together."
- And that was over 15 years.
- That seemed about the right amount.
So I'll see you around.
Maybe we can do something next spring.
"- That would be great, Dad."
- What?
- Bye.
- Bye.
[ENGLISH SDH]
Having a good time in the Judicial.
"How are you, Vincent?"
You get my message?
I prefer to come for you than that we are waiting for you like a fool at home.
"Well I did, did not you?"
Is there for me?
Of course!
"Amin, can you..."
"-Here, we'll share."
You know that Herville leaving?
-Seriously?
He applied for a deputy director of the anti-terrorist unit.
"Poor are getting better, as always."
-There Any others cold?
-It should be.
"One test, Vincent."
By this what you're smelling?
"Well, guys..."
There's no more beer.
Let?
Can.
I'll get my things.
Hello!
"-Back to work, guys!"
"You can not go on like that, Tintin."
"I give all of yourself, okay?"
Just what you did not shot.
-He threatened me.
This is the worst-case scenario legitimate defense.
-Get a grip.
Stop bothering me!
Nothing I did not ask!
"'Kay, come back soon."
Okay.
What's up ?
Don't you think the boys were acting weird ?
"The shifty looks, finishing each other's sentences like they're composing a lie on the spot ?"
Yes.
Totally normal for them.
"I don't know, I feel like they're hiding something."
"If it's not the location of Pancakes, I'm not interested."
"Oh, no."
He was in his cage.
He's gone !
"Oh, no."
Pancakes ?
Pancakes ?
"Okay, I didn't want to worry Taylor."
"She's pretty upset, and she's got this thing about blood."
Blood ?
Yeah.
"Don't freak, okay ?"
I-I-I need you to not freak.
Okay.
Why would I freak out ?
"It's not that bad, is it ?"
"Dude, it's bad."
"Seth, the hospital is, like, a mile away."
"I know, which is why I'm taking the secret back roads way that's only a half mile."
That was sarcasm.
I'm pretty sure my shortcut got us lost.
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
"That was sarcasm, too."
Sorry.
- Two in the center?
- No.
Rules are different for cops.
- I'm losin' my shirt here with you guys.
- So what do I got to do?
- Five out of six in the star.
- Five out of six.
"- Hey, Freddy."
- You a cop too?
"Yeah, yeah, I heard ya."
Enjoy your trip to the big city?
You gotta hit the next five to win.
Shit!
"I just hope you're not trying to prove anything, Freddy."
I know some of them are real assholes.
They think they're high priests or somethin'.
I don't know.
But why would they do all this?
Maybe they're doin' the right thing.
"Liz, I saw these pictures of Ray meeting with these guys."
"You know, like mobsters."
Everyone's houses are financed by these mob banks.
Says who?
IA?
Even you said Joey's death was no accident.
"Joey fell off a building, Freddy!"
Okay?
I don't need this opened up.
Maybe you do.
I don't.
All Joey wanted was a place for us to live.
Who are you to judge that until you've walked in his shoes?
"Should we take notes, or will there be handouts?"
There'll be handouts.
Now as I was saying...
"I'm gonna take notes anyway, just to be safe."
Brought a fresh notebook.
"Oh, boy."
What?
Is that who you were in school?
You were that person?
What person?
"""ms."
"Rinsky, should we take notes?"""
"You know, the suck-up, the goody-goody, the narc."
"Well, if we have to be here, mike,"
"I want to make the most of it,"
"And actually, I was very cool in school."
Okay.
I was.
Okay.
I was.
Am I gonna have to separate you two?
Please.
"Let's face it, to teenagers, old people are like"
Alien life forms from a faraway galaxy
They don't really want to visit.
How are things going in school?
You're... yo in...
"What, the second grade now?"
Uh-huh.
Eighth.
"I'm actually working on a really big science project right now,"
So that's why we have to leave
- No.
No.
It ain't nothing.
- I just...
"- So that's your fine friend, is it?"
"The dirty, filthy brute!"
"If ever a man dared lay a hand to me like that, I'd..."
Well...
Aren't you going to introduce me to our charming visitor?
It's Marcia.
"This is my friend, Mr. Hyde."
"You've heard me speak about him, haven't you?"
"Oh, yes, Marcia."
I've heard a great deal about you.
I've never been interested.
Until now.
I've got to be toddling along now.
"- Toodle-loo, lvy."
"- Oh, no, no."
"Don't go now, Marcia."
"After all, this could be very interesting, the three of us in friendly discussion."
I can't keep my friend waiting.
"- I'll be dropping by, lvy."
"- Yes, yes, yes."
"Drop by sometime when I'm here, Marcia."
Your ideas differ from mine.
It would be a charming experience to change them.
Ivy found it that way.
"Didn't we, dear?"
Nice material.
Goodbye.
Very nice material.
Oh.
"You made my favorite, mommy."
Alan?
I thought you were dead.
I am.
What's it like?
Lovely.
"Come with me, and I'll tell you all about it."
"Oh, wait."
Not yet.
There were lots of doors.
And... and...
Each door led to a different loved one from my life.
My mother.
Mom.
"And my brother, who died last year."
I-I moved easily from room to room.
"And I knew that there were many more rooms ahead that, in time, I would get to."
I wanted to go through those doors.
"Makes no sense, but..."
I feel that I will be going through them...
Soon.
And...
I'm looking forward to it.
Gosh.
"You have any more of that, uh... psilocybin lying around?"
- You serious?
- I want to see my mom.
You're just as likely to see zombies.
"- Well, I would love to see zombies."
- I knew you would.
"Don't you ever, you know, want to ha a spiritual experience?"
This is a smile.
"Yes, it is, 'cause you love your auntie Nai, don't you?"
Oh.
"Oh, isn't he beautiful?"
"When Maya was little, I used to just watch her breathe."
Isn't this the best?
Sure.
I am hogging the baby.
I'm sorry.
Who wants him?
It's Addison's turn.
"Oh, go, go, go."
Yes.
But you're coming back to me.
"Hello, Lucas."
He did just smile.
He smiled.
"Wow, this place looks different."
Pete...
I'm surprised to see you here.
"Unless you're my 2:15 appointment, in which case,"
I'm glad you're finally dealing with your kleptomania.
"Well, that's funny."
You're a funny guy.
"Look, I need to talk to you about Violet."
Are you sure this is a good time?
"Okay, I've been a little overprotective."
You mean territorial.
Whatever psychological term you want to use is fine.
I'm not here to argue with you.
"I told you when you brought her home from the hospital to her home, that was a mistake."
She wasn't ready to face the trauma.
I have aliens at home.
"So relax nicely, don't think about anything."
Life is beautiful.
You don't understand!
-I can't go any further.
-I know.
"-Life is beautiful, isn't it?"
-But I really have two aliens at home.
-A visit from another planet.
"-Well, great!"
"So you will rest at our place, and when you get out of here, you'll be as fit as a fiddle, won't you?"
-Doctor?
-Yes?
-We are full.
We are full.
So you won't rest at our place.
"But you'll go and rest in nature, and you'll be as fit as a squirell."
"Sister, write down."
Nature is the best doctor.
"Doctor, haven't you had enough of us yet?"
No?
-Don't you feel tired?
-Let me see.
You look bad.
Is there something wrong with you?
"No, I'm only a bit overworked."
"Cursed, fucking job!"
Where are you screwing around?
!
"-What's the matter, boss?"
-Watch your language!
Fuck watching my language!
[Sighs] You mind if I...
Record this?
"Oh, this is not an interview."
We're just gonna have a talk.
- I record everything.
- I'd rather you not.
Thank you.
I want to apologize.
- You really don't have to.
"- No, I do."
I reacted emotionally to your article.
That was a mistake.
"You know, these people are my family."
"I'd kill for them, but I shouldn't have said what I said about you."
Or my father's cunt?
[Chuckling] Your your father's cunt.
Got a little personal.
"Well, you got a little personal, too."
- I don't think so.
- No?
Came after me.
"Came after my gym, my fighters."
You came after my son.
How is that not personal?
I write about MMA.
That's all fair game.
"Yeah, but your tone..."
You came after me.
How so?
"Well, you were writing shit that wasn't fact."
"Well, um, Nate lost his fight."
Ryan looked like anything but a champ.
- Where the hell is he?
I wish that I had a friend like you.
"You will, one ofthese days."
Drop your guns!
Your right hand still works?
Well enough.
It's still fast and accurate.
You've got no way out.
Why are you doing this?
"You tell me, what's the alternative?"
- Where's the money?
- Give it to me!
I'm one step ahead.
Why didn't you shoot me in the head?
Maybe I'm no longer a professional.
I wish I could start all over again.
It's a pity...
- Give me the cash.
- Where isJeffrey?
Give me the money first.
We owe it to him.
Hypocrite!
Do all killers have a sense of honor?
The world has changed.
Honor is now a dirty word.
"Sidney, sometimes I think you're not human."
You're more like a dog.
At least we have one thing in common:
We both use guns for a living.
But our motivations are different.
Right?
In some ways dogs are superior to men.
Get off her!
- This is my favorite part.
- Which part?
I was lucky to get out of rebecca's apartment alive.
She threw this at my head.
Finn was reading moby dick?
"No,she was throwing it."
I took it so she couldn't re-arm.
"Okay,let's see what he had at siri's place."
- Razor and a toothbrush.
- Razor and a toothbrush.
Three pairs of white underwear.
Three pairs... pinkish underwear.
One black sock with a gold toe.
Don't you hate it when you leave one black sock at one fiancee's house and the other one at the other's house?
One pair of blue jeans.
And one blacmesh t-shirt.
Do women really like these?
Depends on who's wearing it.
- So if I... - no.
Not much to go on.
Only one place left to check.
Tony just put his hand in ather man's pocket and it made him very happy.
I found a pre-paid calling card.
- That's it?
- Yes.
No engagement rings?
"You want those,too?"
I'll go to siri's and get the ring and any other gifts finn might've given her.
"Mcgee,you've got rebecca."
How uid they have been so clueless?
"Well,he's dead,so maybe they weren'T."
What?
"This is your wake-up call, Mr. Klein."
I didn't ask for a wake-up call.
"What happened to you, Mr. Klein?"
I can't believe I got through.
"Gordon, where are you, man?"
Speak up.
"Listen, John, he was right."
Mr. Cold was right about everything.
Right?
Right about what?
I can't hear you.
He was right about understanding.
"It's real, John."
I want you to know.
- It's real.
- What is...
What are you talking about?
You've got nothing to worry about.
I'll see you in time.
Gordon?
Can they tell how long he was out there?
Looks like he's been dead about eight hours.
He died of exposure.
What made you come out here?
- He called me.
- When?
I didn't like the way he sounded.
"When did he call you, John?"
About an hour ago.
I can't stand this.
It didn't seem right to bring this up at the funeral... but as far as I know there's never been any accidents at the chemical plant.
I can't eat here.
I got to go someplace where they make food that I like.
"Lemon, let's go."
I will not work with Tracy Jordan.
It's just a rumor.
Have you seen any of his movies?
The guy's sensibility is just cretinous.
"I saw the one where he plays, like, five different characters."
"Yeah, ""Black Cop, White Cop."""
No.
"""Who Dat Ninja""?"
"No, he... he had to pretend to be this old lady."
"[High-pitched voice] Ooh, ooh, goodness gracious!"
You hooligans better watch out!
[Normal voice] 'Cause this honky grandma be trippin'!
"Oh, yeah, that movie was hilarious."
"I saw it, like, five times."
Where's the love?
[Indistinct shouting]
Right on.
"Hey, let me get two half a chickens and some pecan waffles."
Nothing for me.
"I had, like, four hot dogs this morning."
"Eat, Lemon, eat."
I hate skinny women.
"Hey, Lana, 10 beers."
"So, Tracy, we should talk about the show."
I ain't doing it unless I can get to do it my way.
"You know, I want it to be raw, HBO-style content."
"Well, it's not HBO."
It's TV.
And I don't think that it's a good fit.
I didn't know his body was there!
I told you.
I followed you to apologise.
- I believe you.
- It's true!
Of course.
The transfer linkage you asked for.
About time.
Any news from the search parties?
No.
"No, there won't be."
"It was an unlikely idea, keeping out of sight for the length of time this ship has been in flight."
Not really possible.
I agree.
So who do you think it is?
- Mandrian.
- Why?
Instinct.
I discount Dr Kendall.
I thought you mistrusted instinct?
"I do, so I am probably wrong."
"It could be him I told you I heard him quarrelling with Sara, didn't I?"
"Sonheim makes me uneasy, too."
He would be next on my list.
The answer is here.
If only we could see it.
I knew you'd be here.
[DISTANT METEOR IMPACTS]
How far are we in now?
Halfway I can't be sure.
The detectors are swamped.
The force wall's eating into our power reserves.
I'm sorry.
I wish I'd come to see you sooner.
Big Brother!
Did you come to see me?
You'd better hurry or you'll miss your plane.
No.
I've decided not to go.
But what about your work?
"Shinjiro, you go and see how Grandma is doing."
Is something the matter with Grandma?
There's something strange!
Grandma is sleeping.
Snoring up a storm!
How is she?
"She ate some rice porridge, but she's asleep again."
"Shall we go to bed, too?"
It looks like we're going to have some rain.
Shall we close the sliding doors?
Grandma!
The bomb!
"What's the matter, Grandma?"
Grandma!
What's going on?
It's the bomb!
"You two, quick!"
Put this over you.
This is best for the bomb!
There're many who survived because they were wearing something white!
"The sooner, the better."
Let's take her to the hospital right away!
She's sound asleep now.
Maybe we should leave her as she is a little longer.
Stop.
Stop!
Why did you save me?
You're like my father.
But such obsession.
You forced me to sit in the car.
Otherwise I would've shown you more.
Here's an advice.
Listen carefully and follow it.
Live larger than life.
Laugh more than you can cry.
Forgo your anger.
And finish your enemies with a smile.
Get it?
There's a rage in my heart too.
They killed 10 of my men.
I'll kill 20.
But... look at the boiling point of my mind.
It's still zero!
- Name.
- I want to forget mine.
Who I am where from everything.
Still I would like to know.
You can have a little faith in the Big Boss.
What do you say Boss?
And this way Big Boss made that boy... heir to his world and his heart.
And gave that nameless boy name... that fitted his stature.
BOSS!
Boy saves Haryana's transport king's life.
Satyakant.
You're still reading 15 year old news about your son.
You know very well Raghunath.
I was thinking a 99 Euro show.
Do you want something with style or do you want to be cheap?
Who'd pay me that?
Doesn't 99 sound better than 100?
In the supermarket sure...
"But for your event, 99 sounds as stupid as 100."
Sitting up there in his hotel suite and dreaming of the whole wide world...
How much do you think I earn in this place?
Definitely more than we do in our hotel.
"That's your fault, my dear Alfons."
"Just to settle it, Toni's 500 Euro show."
And that's exactly the amount I want for each night.
You've got to be kidding.
Yes Franz?
I just wanted to check up on you.
I'm doing fine.
Are you alone?
No.
How come?
What is all this here?
Who is that?
That's my brother Franz.
Franz this is Max.
Can we talk for a moment Babette?
No.
- Would you leave please?
Why?
Why should I?
Listen this isn't the right time.
Okay?
Who the hell are you?
I don't even know you.
"- Remember, bust them, you buy them."
"- Yeah, yeah."
"Hey, you know what you're doing?"
- We're running out of fuel.
- You're lying.
"The aircraft was topped off to tour Honolulu, not island hop."
"Take a look, you see that?"
That's ten minutes max.
- It's 15 to Molokai.
"- Look, just find a way, all right?"
"Spoke to Honolulu approach, your bird is 6 miles east-southeast heading towards Molokai."
"Okay, copy that."
"Chin, over there."
They should be in that direction.
Got them.
About three miles east.
Don't lose them.
I'm coming around.
- What's going on?
- What do you think is going on?
"All right, here we go."
"Everyone, hang on."
This is gonna get ugly.
- They just went down.
- Yeah.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Got a single gunshot wound.
He's dead.
Family's gone.
He took them hostage.
"Look, just let my wife and my son go, I'll do..."
"None of you are going anywhere till I get off this island, all right?"
Guys!
Guys!
I'm a fucking genius.
"I know, but look at that painting."
Holy shit!
I know.
"I mean, the camera sees my work before I do it."
It's just incredible.
I don't have to be blocked anymore!
(GROANS)
(GRUNTS) I'm in.
(CHUCKLES) Yes!
Yes.
(CHUCKLES)
(HOWLS)
(SIGHS)
(GLASS CLINKS)
You're up early.
What time is it?
How about we start with what year is it?
"Oh, so you can write in a dead man's journal, but I'm not allowed to wear his hat?"
"This isn't poetry, Jasper,"
I'm making our to-do list.
"If we're really going through with this, we need to start making it look like Mr. B's still around."
"I mean, this is actually happening?"
"What are you talking about, bro?"
It already happened.
It's done.
"Well, I mean, we could just not go through with it."
"Actually, I think we have to."
"If I understand this correctly, this is how it works."
The camera spits out a photo of us in the future.
- You off-duty?
- This isn't a cab.
Are you off-duty?
"I had laryngitis, remember?"
I was sick this whole time.
You didn't sound like you during this.
- During this stuff?
"- Yeah, during all this stuff."
"Aaron Yoo was really driving that van, by the way."
Confidently.
- It doesn't sound like I have laryngitis.
- I don't think you sound that different.
"It's because Self, our PA from heaven, used to bring me hot beverages."
- We miss you.
- I love Self.
- you two might get stuck.
Having some trouble?
"Hey, I bet that wasn't looped."
I was with Jonny...
I was with Jonny during that moment.
ADR.
Whatever.
"I'm not trying to show off, I'm just saying."
You know what though?
This is bad because I'm loving watching this and not saying anything interesting.
Don't look at it.
"- Yeah, look away."
- I can't look away.
"Hey, I think I should..."
- This was freezing.
- This is from cold.
- This awkward...
Please.
Please let go.
- What's the count?
- Please don't hurt me.
"- I said, what's the count?"
"- Look, I haven't even done anything!"
What's the count?
Plus 18.
"Oh, you've gotta be kidding."
"Congratulations, Ben."
"Sorry, we had to make sure you'd keep the count under pressure."
Welcome to the team.
We didn't mean it.
"It's okay, Campbell, I cried inside that bag."
Fisher and Jimmy have always been the big players.
I want you to take Jimmy's place.
I've never done this.
I know that and I understand.
"But I don't trust the girls, and Choi is, well, Choi."
"Look, I've been teaching for more than 14 years, and I've never had a student as impressive as you."
Your brain is like a goddamn Pentium chip.
You're gonna do great.
You know how I know that?
'Cause you remind me of myself 25 years ago.
You in?
- Yeah.
"Yeah, I'm in."
- Good.
Good.
"There's one more thing, Ben, and this is important."
"We're counting cards, we're not gambling."
We're following a specific set of rules and playing a system.
You sent that to Tyler.
(screams)
I can't go home.
I can never go home again.
It can't be that bad.
Whoa.
I have never even seen this on the Internet.
You watch that kind of stuff on the Internet?
Sometimes.
Don't you?
"No, it's blocked at my house."
"I thought it was because of my dad, but now I'm wondering if it's because of my mom."
Hmm.
You'll be fine.
"My dentist accidentally sexts me, like, once a week."
Ooh.
You know what I'm gonna do?
"I'll look him in the eye and I'll just say,"
"""Hey, autocorrect completely changed the grocery list I gave your dad."""
"Well, not completely."
"I mean, ""cream"" and ""meat"""
could have stayed the same.
"God, Tim, why?"
Why aren't you helping me with this?
!
"I'm sorry, honey."
"I'm just enjoying this too much because, for once, it's not me who screwed up."
"Okay, you know what I need?"
I-I need the advice...
of a professional.
Did I do this to you?
Did I make you like this?
"It's one who sets the table, prepares a meal or teaches in a certain way."
"- You're an artist, isn't she?"
- Thank you.
Why didn't you use the Limoges?
May I serve you?
- Rose!
- My hands are clean.
"We go to all this trouble, and Rose and I don't eat very much."
- Really?
- Mmm.
I've always thought she had a very healthy appetite.
I can't stand women who eat two bites and say they're full.
Do you really need extra salt?
You know how it retains water.
Can I have some?
And potatoes.
Mmm-mmm.
You don't need them.
Have you ever sat in on one of your daughter's classes?
- Rose!
- What?
That's the best part.
- Rose tells me you've never been married.
- Mom.
"That's all right, Rose."
"That's correct, Mrs. Morgan."
I guess I haven't found the right girl.
"I've had relationships that haven't worked out, but that will change."
Really?
Why?
"As I told Rose,"
I have a theory about love and sex.
We gave it our very best.
I'm not sure.
Maybe the police?
Who are you supposed to call when you think someone may have taken their own life?
- Helen?
- Betts!
"I just got home, and I found this."
What?
Look at this.
"Uh, ""nothing to live for,"""
"and then at the ending, when he says about the St. Louis Arch."
"Oh, my God."
Okay.
"Well, he-- he can't mean the thing about the Arch."
You've got to be a sherpa to get up that thing.
"So, where is he?"
I--
Oh.
I didn't hear you girls come in.
Oh.
"Uh, I was just doodling the way a depressed person does."
- Ha!
- How would you even climb up the Arch?
"That was a thoughtless, childish, moronic thing to do!"
"Okay, I'm-- I'm sorry, but... on the other hand, what reason do I have to live?"
I don't know.
Why don't you ask the Arch?
"No, I mean it."
"My kids are gone, I have no wife, even my parents have died."
"I'm... nobody's son, nobody's husband, nobody's father."
But... you are the father of our child.
I'm not even that.
Absolutely authentic.
And the staircase came from Switzerland.
Ah!
Do you like it?
I know this house.
I have been often here when Jimmy Edwards owned it.
The banker.
It brought him lots of luck.
He made millions.
I'll take it.
"You'll never be sorry, Mr. Sabourin."
Isn't this a rather large house for you?
"Oh, I don't know."
In Europe I lived in a palace for some time.
So did I.
But when the king was unfaithful...
I moved.
You know the price is $300.000 furnished.
I'll give you a fairly substantial deposit.
$5.000 in cash.
I'll sigh the rest of the papers tomorrow.
"You really make up your mind fast, don't you?"
"Oh, you!"
"Yes, sir?"
Who do you work for?
"No one, sir."
Now that you have bought the house.
You're working for me now.
"Thank you, sir."
I want dinner for two tonight.
The best you can get.
"Get a cook, maid, anything you want."
"She did the same, too."
She said she loved me but betrayed me since I got sick.
Rotten bitches.
Dirty bitches.
All sluts like you should be wiped out for this country and society.
I'm doing a good deed for making a just society.
I'm a servant of pure justice.
I'm Wonder Woman.
15 minutes left!
Hurry up!
Why are you so slow?
Then carry her instead!
We have no time!
What'll you do if something happens to her?
Hey!
Wake up!
Please wake up!
Are you alright?
Where's Mr. Hong?
You shouldn't be here.
Hurry and run!
I was misunderstood because of you.
"Wait, why are you giving it to her?"
If she eats his liver...
We've waited for a thousand years!
How could you do that?
"Dad, one of us has to sacrifice because of him!"
Right.
I've lived long enough.
Take care of the youngest.
We have no time.
Hurry and start.
- I didn't chop them up.
- I donated them to science.
- Donating my ass!
How much did you get?
Two grand a body.
- But the benefit of medical research...
- Who'd you hawk them to?
Who'd you hawk them to?
A guy named Russ Bianco.
"I call a number, and he meets me."
You Bianco?
"Yeah, where's Mogan?"
"Ah, he couldn't make it."
He knew I needed the cash.
Name's Elliot.
I work in the morgue with him.
You got a city ID?
Fresh off the slab.
"- Uh, he's not an addict."
- No.
That guy's in better shape than the stiffs Mark usually sends me.
Brain hemorrhage.
Tox screen clean.
So...
Nice gig Mark's got going here.
How's your supply?
Always looking for more.
Why?
One of my cousins works in the Manhattan morgue.
Make sure he's discreet.
"You see something you think I'll like, give me a call./ All right."
You wanna give me a hand with this guy?
It's just a riot!
"And what's that, Nina?"
Do you smoke?
!
- Drop it now!
"- Come on, mama!"
- Give it to me!
"- Stop it, mama!"
I know what I'm doing!
"Here, you may have it!"
Did I give birth to you for you to smoke that filth?
"Will you shut up, please?"
"- Nina, hurry, the telephone!"
- What do you care?
- Maybe it's for me?
- Who can call you?
Perhaps there's someone.
"Stop it, you've just arrived."
Hello?
- Do you have a rag?
"- I'll do it later, mom."
I'm listening.
Are you going to play the silent game?
"Well, as you wish."
He wouldn't answer?
"No, he wouldn't answer."
"Nina, I see Stasik is still into his snags, making sculptures."
Good for him.
"- Remember Kolia, the Pioneer leader?"
"- Yes, I do."
"I just finished packing, was about to go to the station, and here he comes carrying all kinds of roots and knolls and some weird stumps."
"Here, Aunt Marusya, take them to your son-in-law."
I'm Seaman Robert Epplund.
We were on the Hagen together.
You knew Petty Officer Adams?
"We were friends, yeah."
I just found out what happened.
I can't believe it.
He was doing fine when I saw him last night.
What time was that?
"Uh, like, 11:00 or so."
"His crew was the first section off for liberty, we were the second."
He was in a great mood.
He was going to see his girlfriend.
"Like, totally in love with her."
He kept saying she was the one.
"""The One's"" name wouldn't happen to be Meredith Bilson, would it?"
"Yeah, that's her."
Does she know?
We'll stay in touch.
Thank you.
Thanks.
The director has always been very protective of his family.
That should come as no surprise.
"No, it's not just that."
It's something else.
Can't put my finger on it.
"And you're worrying that whatever ""it"" is may prevent the director from seeking the truth?"
"It's not him, Duck."
It's me.
Family or not.
I gotta do my job.
"Do you have news, Dr. Mallard?"
I was just about to brief Agent Gibbs.
Because of Mum?
Right.
Do you want me to get rid of them?
'Cause I will if it's bugging you?
"How about you just keep the music down a bit, OK?"
"Thanks George, you're the best."
Good work Dad.
(PARTY MUSIC IN OTHER ROOM)
Hey Shay.
"Gotta love your brother, right?"
He doesn't give up.
"You do know what a lost cause is, right?"
Mm-hm.
"Except it's not, is it?"
"You know it, I know it, so why avoid the inevitable?"
Because maybe I want more for myself?
"Not to be one of the Lindsays of this world, hanging off some random guy's every word to fill the void of my existence."
"Yeah, but I'm not some random guy, am I?"
But you might as well be.
Dad?
"It's time, Dad."
Time for what?
We want our house back.
Fair enough.
Alright everyone!
Just...
"Sorry to break up the party everyone but it's time to move it elsewhere, please."
Sorry.
"Thanks for having us, Mr T."
It's been spiritual.
"Yeah, thanks Ollie."
No worries mate.
- At Brian's house.
- Oh my God.
Can you believe it?
Right in the front yard.
Brian watched the entire thing through his kitchen window.
I thought you and Angela were really tight.
She was like my best friend.
This whole things been really hard for me to accept.
But Brian wouldn't lie.
So it's like...
it's like she's this completely different person.
Like a slut?
No.
"No, she's not."
I think she's just confused or something.
- Do you want me to kill her?
"- No, it doesn't matter."
Brian's the one who ought to be killed.
He should definitely die.
You know he's going to rat on Rickie.
What actually is there to rat on Rickie.
Do you know?
"I know whatever he did, he did because he had to."
You haven't had to clean him up after some Neanderthal...
beat the hell out of him.
"Come here for a minute, son."
Rickie Vasquez.
Are you familiar with the name?
Excuse me?
"What can you tell me, son, about Rickie Vasquez?"
He goes here.
"I don't, I mean..."
"Listen to me, there's no cash with me."
They took the bag with them when they¡ª
"Asshole, I saw them leave."
No bag.
Get it.Now.
Ok.
"We have security cameras in here, you know."
You don't got shit.
"You're running an illegal joint under the table and off the books, asshole."
- Nice and easy.
- Ok.
"Ok, take the money out of the bag."
Put it down so I can see it.
And you're gonna put it back in.
Very slowly.
"If you play your cards right,"
"I'm going to leave quietly, and you're not going to tell anybody about this, because reporting a robbery of unreported income would be insane."
As would doing anything other than what I just told you.
Right.
- How much of this should--
- Just keep it coming.
Putting it right here.
Nice.
Shit.
Just take the money.
Can you hear me?
Hey.
Hey.
Jesus christ.
"You want to be a hero, asshole?"
You want to be a goddamn hero?
Guess I do.
"Oh, well, you know."
"Hey, if, uh, the mountain won't come to Muhammad-"
"Hey, Danny, look."
"As your accountant and as your friend,"
I sort of feel I have some kind of fiduciary obligation to advise you-
I know.
You want me to sell my dad's house.
I will.
"Hey, every month you don't,"
- you're incurring a wholly unnecessary tax liability.
- I get it.
- You like that?
"- Yeah, I get it."
Yeah?
What about this?
What if I put you in touch with a broker?
"I'd love to chat, Stan, but I gotta go home and get some sleep."
Good.
"Then you can be fresh for my poker game tonight, huh?"
"Yes, sir."
Hey.
Hey.
An accountant that works out of a topless pool.
Nice.
He's bugging me about selling my dad's house.
How much you say he bought the place for?
"He bought the land for 16,000 and built the house himself."
"16,000?"
Yeah.
You know how much it's worth?
A million and a half.
Excuse me.
Goten!
You should not touch it so suddenly.
right?
It is an invention of mom.
She said that nothing could be detected with the award.
So we will not be able to see ...
Do not worry.
but ...
Did you see?
There is always some trick!
Trunks!
I'll show you the special prize!
Wow!
I'm hungry...
Pilaf-sama!
I'm a dog but this is too much!
what guarantees that this island is a treasure?
It's what this map says!
looking good ...
How could you believe this ?
!
the motor broke down because it is not of good quality.
we will not get to reach the port.
What are we going to do?
I am going to die here?
Stay calm and continue to seek the treasure!
I'm hungry...
I want to eat monjayaki ...
I do not get any fish or fish... right?
Wow!
right?
My mama collected these today!
It's not like you're one of them.
Schanke...
um...
What would you say if...
What would you say if I told you that I was an addict?
"[LAUGHS] Yeah, right, and I'm the Maharishi."
"Hey, wait, wait, wait, I'm serious."
"I'm talking to you, here, okay?"
Seriously.
An addict?
"Wait, wait, we're not talking about the red wine in the refrigerator, are we, because..."
"No, no, no, absolutely not."
"You're perfectly all right, Nick."
You're perfectly fine.
Absolutely not.
Trust me.
[LAUGHS]
So much for step number one.
Yeah?
What's step number two?
[POURING]
"Hi, my name's Nick, and I'm an addict."
"It's the hunger that drives me, and it's not for, um... for booze, or crack, or junk."
"It's for, um..."
I drink blood so that I can live forever.
LACROIX:
What's so terrible about that?
"You have to fight it, Nick."
You don't have to listen to him.
"She's right, Nicholas, don't listen to me."
Listen to your hunger.
Listen to the beast in your veins calling to you.
Not her.
I'm talking about this.
Family Tragedy Linked To Wild Mushrooms
"""Murdered by... wild mushrooms""?"
What did the dermatologist say?
Mushrooms?
"He wasn't sure, so he referred Heung-guk to the hospital."
Told you.
It can't be the mushrooms.
It's not impossible.
Shut your hole.
You know that story Byeong-gyu told you?
There are so many.
The one about the naked man eating the deer carcass.
What's gotten into you?
At a crazy time like this?
It's because things are so crazy.
"You know the guy who saw it, right?"
"""Herbs  Tonics"""
Over here.
"You may not believe it, but I saw it with my own eyes."
Look at this.
Can you see it?
Sure.
I got 22 stitches.
From falling on your head while you were drunk?
What are you talking about?
I'm too old to make shit up.
You got proof?
Proof?
"Hell yes, proof!"
I'm not the kind to talk shit without backing it up.
I go on long-term disability.
At 75% pay.
"And then do what, shay?"
I fish off Navy pier for the next 20 years?
It's dumping gas!
- Get a hose on there!
- Go!
You're going in there?
You need to get back behind the lines.
"Mouch, get this kid safe."
I'm not gonna pretend like I don't remember peeling you off the floor after that woman broke your heart.
I know.
I just always thought she was the one.
Come on!
Get down!
[Children cheering]
When can we go back inside?
"We have to check with the gas company, ma'am."
And they'll tell you when it's safe.
"Ms. Simpson, I was looking for Leonard to get the keys to the shed."
No one's seen him.
"Oh, God."
"Everyone, stop."
We're going back in.
[Dramatic music]
?
Leonard!
Down here?
Call out!
You guys smell anything?
Are we sure they cut off the gas lines?
"Oh, I shut it down myself."
- I don't blame you for not trusting me.
"Look, if it makes you feel any better, the Marta I knew wouldn't be involved in anything like this."
People don't change that much.
"Jacob, where are we going now?"
I'm gonna do whatever it takes to get her back.
"If I'm gonna save her, I'll need your help."
Can I trust you?
C'mon.
That's it.
"Shit, c'mon."
Jared.
How'd you recognize me?
From pictures.
Of us together.
Where's Jacob?
"Take me to Julia, and when I know she's okay, I'll call him."
"What would you say if I told you, uh she was still in Italy?"
Then you don't get your money.
"Good old Jacob, huh?"
I shoulda known he'd keep the game interesting.
Where is he?
Is he looking at us now?
Is the girl in Italy?
"No, she's here in Zurich."
I have a taxi waiting.
How long was I with you?
Not long.
You were setting me up.
To get the money.
(speaking German)
How did we get together?
Does it really matter?
"- Hey, Katie."
- Mm-hmm?
"Why don't you sit your bottom here, next to me?"
"Oh, Vali, I think I'm going to go ahead and probably sit next to anyone else."
Fair enough.
- I'll sit there.
- Okay.
Mom.
Do you want to go ahead and sit next to me?
Oh!
I would love that.
"Hey, I'm sorry things got awkward with us today."
Let's just start over.
"Happy Thanksgiving, Greg."
"Oh, happy Thanksgiving."
You...
You just unhooked my bra.
That's not even a thing I can do if I'm trying!
"Oh, Greg."
"The one time a year we get little marshmallows on sweet potatoes, and you're too high to put them on the table."
I made a lot of bad decisions yesterday.
You're telling me.
You left the oven on all night long.
You could have burned down the house.
I also left the sink on.
It would have put out part of the fire.
Oh.
No!
"No, no, no, no, no!"
What?
"Apparently, I also agreed to make an ""Amazing Race"" audition video with my mom."
"Always say no to drugs, Katie."
"It's me, Caroline."
My cards were stolen.
I've seen backs of vans with better candy selections.
This is a disgrace to the name Gas and Gobble.
How do you even wake up in the morning?
My alligator licks my face.
"Oh, my God, Max."
Whoever stole our credit cards maxed them out.
"They spent the $1,500 we had left."
No way.
"Someone just spent $1,500 on phone cards and cigarettes."
His name was Caroline Channing.
What?
That's my name!
"Ah, you got a dude's name."
"Ugh, we were robbed."
Police!
Where!
"Max, I am tired and I'm hungry and I can't find a mirror, but I am sensing a disturbance in my hair."
We have to go home!
But we have to go to Texas.
Randy needs me.
He's saying it on his Snapchat story.
Still on the movie set.
"Pretty lonely, so if anyone would respond to my Words With Friends request,"
"I promise to let you win, and if you're ever in Texas... why?"
See?
He's begging me to come there.
But we have no money to get to Texas.
Wrong.
I've got $11 in this one and $32 in this one.
Lefty's been holding back as per usual.
I won it last night at his casino.
You owed him this much money?
- Double it.
- Harry!
- Don't start with me.
- You need to get a grip on this.
How does a man who spends all his time fighting the bad guys get into so much trouble with his own side?
Hmm?
"- Thank you, Rich."
- Pleasure.
Here.
"Look, um..."
There's something else.
What?
Will you have a look at this?
"(LAUGHS) I didn't take you as the bangle type, Harry, but then jewelry creeps up on the best of us."
- Where did you get this?
- It's hard to explain.
A woman?
- You dark horse!
Take it off.
- I can't.
"- Well, let me try."
- I've tried.
It won't come off.
"Well, how did you get it on in the first place?"
- I haven't a baldy.
"- Wow, that must have been some night."
Right...
- I have no idea what this is.
- Really?
Or where it comes from or how old it is.
"Yes, I am."
- No.
"Dr Brandon is his physician, but he's on vacation."
I've treated him in the interim.
- Look.
His name's on the prescription.
- I didn't know.
- Did you prescribe those for Saul?
"- Yes, I did."
- Does he need them?
- They're nitroglycerine tablets - only to be taken in case of a heart attack.
Has Mr Greenberg suffered a seizure?
- Ruben?
"- Yeah, I'm back."
- How is he?
- He's still out.
His heart seems steadier though.
You have any problems?
"No, I left the ambulance in a dirt road off the jungle in Koko Head."
"But coming back, a coastguard cutter was dropping black flags in the water."
- It must be some kind of a warning.
"- Yeah, maybe to keep us in."
Don't worry.
"We'll get out of here tomorrow, no matter what."
- And the woman?
- We'll get her too.
- Give him an injection!
- What about his heart?
The hell with his heart!
inject him!
Hello.
He tried to escape.
I think someone took my wallet.
You heard Ed.
I gotta get some sleep.
So-
"Come on, Jerry."
Give him a six.
Yes!
Look at that.
He listens.
"You are the man, Jerry!"
Oh!
I'm winning more money.
I'm winning more money!
All right.
"Keep it comin', Jerry, 'cause I'm in the zone and you are en fuego."
I've never seen anything like it.
We've switched tables on him.
We've switched decks.
We even switched chips.
The man keeps dealing winners.
How much has he cost us?
"This guy is up 300,000."
Are you sure the dealer isn't cheating?
Maybe he's signaling the player.
We did a complete analysis.
It's just one of those streaks.
"Well, if he continues on one of those streaks, doesn't it make sense to put him where he's gonna cause the least amount of damage?"
"Yes, Miss Mancuso, it does."
"The people here, do they think about making sense?"
"We try to, Miss Mancuso."
And what's with the Miss Mancuso routine?
I thought you told me that's what you wanted me to call you.
She ain't bad.
"Yeah, she's the chick, all right, but she don't wanna do it."
"Well, shit, I'll go somewhere else."
"Now, now, wait a minute."
"If we discipline her a little, she'll be glad to do it."
"You'd like to watch that, wouldn't you?"
- Yeah.
- No!
[Whimpering]
[Laughing]
"Eh, can I, uh... yeah, but it's gonna cost you extra."
"Yeah, all right."
Go get your toy.
"No, ah!"
[Whimpering]
No... no!
"No, no."
[Gasping]
"No, no."
"Oh, please!"
[Screaming]
Do you have to get up early?
"I'm supposed to have the day off, but, uh, you never can tell."
What's your day like?
"So far, so good."
"Yes, Al, we're ready on the floor."
Twenty seconds to air.
"Mic up, over there."
"Sit down, here we go, in ten..."
"Five, four, three, two... good morning, I'm rodger grimsby."
"Here now, the news."
"Early today, the grisly remains of a reputed meat mobster, gino pontivini, were found on the floor of a warehouse in the South Bronx, beneath a huge meat grinding machine."
"- We were on the roof it was freezing, there was a helicopter flying around, and he was kind of shouting it at me."
"It's every girl's dream, right?"
- What'd you say?
- Nothing.
"Really, because, you know, he didn't mean it."
It just
- It was just something that happened.
I don't know.
"Hi, it's Abby."
What?
"Oh, my God."
Was anybody there?
"No, from the ER."
Okay.
I'll be right in.
- What's the matter?
- I
- I have to go.
"But come by the hospital later, and I'll give you a ride to the bus station."
Okay.
Or you could stay a few more days.
"No, I"
- I have to get back to work.
Be here waiting in case he shows up.
What if he shows up in Minnesota?
You're right.
Nothing confirmed.
Looks like you got multiple shooters on the loose.
- She's dropping her sats.
- Keep those people away from the building.
Can we talk to her now in case she can't later?
Setting up for multiple traumas.
After all.
I always have to tell you twice.
Now you're so nicely raised by your balls.
- What's that?
Why did you flinch?
- Please forgive me.
You lie before me like a pig hoisted by its balls.
Yeah?
"Yeah, I know."
I'll just wash our glasses and then come.
Bye.
Miss Russo.
Mi...
"Miss Russo, it's Danny Ferman."
You ca...
So that's it?
You don't need anything else from me besides my statement?
There isn't much to do until we get toxicology.
But I can tell you now it's gonna say smack.
Okay.
She was a witness on the Malcolm Miller case.
Usually kill 'em before they testify.
She lied on the stand.
- I've seen it a thousand times.
"They finally think they're clean, then something stresses them out."
Like the trial.
And they just have a little too much.
I'll call you when I get the tox.
"But I promise you, she OD'd."
What about the juror assault?
Any leads on that?
- A sadist?
Yeah.
I will take that.
Ohh.
"Sorry I got annoyed, but [clears throat] you were interrogating me."
I just want to know what's going on in your life.
"Yeah, and then get mad about the parts you don't like."
Some guy I've never fucking heard of is taking you to the Getty.
You're wearing expensive lingerie.
"All I have is expensive lingerie, Jay."
Who else are you sleeping with?
"I mean, should I be wearing a condom?"
- Excuse me?
- Are you fucking this guy?
Don't talk to me like I'm at your gym.
I'm sorry.
You're right.
That was crass.
Are you fucking this gentleman?
- Ugh.
"- ""Ugh."""
You're a pain in my ass.
- Oh?
- Uh-huh.
His name is Paul.
We lived together for five years.
The house is his.
"And, no, I'm not fucking him."
He's just paying for you?
No.
Just the house.
And he's taking you to gala events.
"She's, um-- she's doing all right."
Thanks for asking.
"Now, who's gonna bring me back some candy?"
- I will!
- Yeah!
"Hey, tell your mom you get to eat as much as you can fit in your mouth."
- [Laughs]
- Right.
You guys have fun.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Bye.
See you when you get back.
- Look at you.
- Restaurant tricks.
Impressive.
[Marching band music] 25 members...
Look at these chumps.
"Are you kidding, man?"
Parade detail is great.
"Peter Mills, hold your arm up."
Now keep it there for five hours.
That's what being in the parade is.
"Mills, the shriners-- they throw out candy-- you clean up, man."
"Now, listen, I know you guys are gonna give me crap for this."
Go on.
[Sighs]
I want to start a podcast.
What the hell's that?
"Well, when I record myself being equal parts charming and brilliant, and then I put it up on iTunes, and people subscribe, and they follow me."
A mute would be better at that than you.
[Laughter]
"When did he call you, John?"
About an hour ago.
I can't stand this.
John!
It didn't seem right to bring this up at the funeral... but as far as I know there's never been any accidents at the chemical plant.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I got your message the other day.
"I meant to call you back, but I forgot."
Don't you remember leaving me that message?
"Chief, this is John Klein."
I didn't call him.
"No, it's not me."
I analyzed both tapes with the voice print.
I don't care.
It may be my voice.
It's not me.
Listen to me.
I would swear in a court of law that that's your voice.
"Yeah, great."
Thanks.
$%#!
"Regular coffee to go, please."
Seventy-five cents.
Have a great day.
Do you know that woman?
- What woman?
- She just left.
You didn't see her?
- No.
- That's strange.
"She had long red hair, green eyes, real pretty, and she was asking about you."
John?
I want you to be strong.
I know I will.
Because you never let me down.
"Penguin, still there?"
"Yes, right here."
You can leave them at home safe with her mother?
"-Daddy, what are you talking about?"
-What are you talking about?
"Sorry, kids."
The career of his father came to an end.
"No, Dad."
"No, Dad."
Let's take a look around.
Can you see any way out?
"Yes, only creating a pair of wings."
-Can you move?
"-I'm stuck, pal."
"Okay, everybody, move away from the edge we depart the edge."
"Okay, do not move until I return."
Where you going?
I'll see what I can do by their father.
What can he do?
He's just an ordinary penguin.
This is another small step for a krill.
A great leap invertebrate without a cord.
Holy mother of krill!
"How is your appetite, Bill?"
He is great?
-What do you think you're doing?
Armando-strike.
Can not ...
You do not give boat you're a krill.
- Is it?
"You guys, nobody better fall sleep watching this commentary."
- Let's talk about this damn church.
- This is one of my favorite churches.
"- That's like Broadway, right?"
- Andy Samberg is genius.
- Famous street in New York.
"- Yeah, but it's..."
"Mike, why don't you talk about what it was like to film this?"
- How did you...?
"Yeah, you guys..."
- This was very late.
I remember it was the last thing in the night.
"- Andy was around for hours, though."
- Yeah.
"In fact, this was the same night as the convenience store thing."
- Right.
"- So this was, like, 6 in the morning."
"We started shooting the next scene at about 5, 5:30."
Yeah.
And we had to finish before the sun came up.
Yeah.
And we had to finish before the sun came up.
- This...
That.
- That.
Let's talk about that.
That is so good.
- It's so frigging good.
- Let's talk about it.
Let's discuss that.
"When you push those doors and you say, ""Yeah."""
Madam you go to bathroom.
No...
"Madam you go to bathroom, go... go..."
lock the door from inside.
Are you Laxmi Narayan?
Yeah.
Are you father of Sonu?
Yeah... you came so early son?
You were in Singapore?
Yeah my work has finished early so i thought...
"Papa doesn't know about bra, pantee and design so you came to tell me."
I am selling undergarment since you were not even wearing it.
"And now you will explain me, now get out."
Out?
Why?
One second...
where are you going?
"Bathroom dad, why you are going?"
To get light... no... now i wont let you get light anymore.
See how thin you have become.
"Do eat or not, now i wont let you go thin never..."
"Dad, please get a side or it will come out."
If went inside mine will be out.
I said no...
Dad what is she doing here?
"Son, she is... you know my nature right?"
Now i know
now why hide from Son.
Your dad with me in this room... was finagling the deal.
What kind of deal?
Should i tell Laxmi Narayan Jee?
"I will tell me he is my son, we talk regularly."
Yeah.
Do you remember that he had scars on his face?
"Oh, sure."
It would look like he was burned.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
"This is where your father had his office, right there, where it says tickets, upstairs."
That's 1501.
"That's where he was, right here."
[truck roars by]
(Kahn) The office at 1501 Walnut Street was the last place I saw my father.
My mother would bring me here sometimes after hours and on weekends.
Lou would lean out the top floor window and toss down a key wrapped in yellow tracing paper to let us in.
[phone ringing]
"(Louis Kahn) When I went to high school, I had a teacher in the arts who was head of the department, Central High:"
William Gray.
I am no longer amused.
You will die together.
"Give my regards to King Tut, asshole."
How much time do we have left?
- 45 seconds.
He's leaving.
Turn it off.
- I can't disarm it.
- What?
They've got it rigged.
I got an idea.
I always knew you'd get us back.
"- Yeah, right."
- Later.
"Thanks, Daniel."
You sure you wanna do this?
"Stupid, bloody engine, eh?"
How can one little drink...
I gotta get home or I'll be late.
How about a kiss?
Not thank you.
I could be back in action tomorrow... ?
Bon a fee passengers come on!
Bon a fee passengers to the right.
Catrin?
I got caught in the raid.
Ended up in the big street shelter.
I didn't know where you were.
I didn't know if you were safe.
I never know if you're safe.
Oh God!
Look at you.
I'll be alright after a cuppa tea.
They've already ruptured the mains.
"Look, Catrin..."
I want you to go back to Ebbw Vale.
Ellis!
It's the biggest steelworks in Europe.
"They are more likely to get bombed there, than here..."
It's just not the bombing.
I can't afford for us to live here anymore.
"I can't afford for us to live, anywhere."
I earn.
"If I want on my own, I can toss myself in a Paris studio."
I could keep painting.
You don't have to keep me.
I earn!
Your wages seem better off a husband's roof over your head.
What if I wake up?
Shan.
Believe it.
OK.
Come on.
Are they...?
They're wolves.
"Tom, they're wolves."
All this time.
It was wolves.
- My beast isn't a beast at all.
- How can there be wolves?
They've been extinct in Britain for years.
Maybe people just think they died out.
"Maybe they've been here all the time, surviving without anyone knowing."
"Right, you ready, Kyle?"
Sleeping animals are a lot easier to film than angry snarling ones.
Turns out The Beast wasn't a beast at all.
"Thought to be extinct in this country, these two wolves... have survived."
Their existence a secret for years... until I found them.
"Not a bad night's work, eh?"
They're waking up.
You should let them go now.
Why would I do that?
"Give us a hand, Steve."
What are you doing?
"I'm not going to leave them here for someone else to find, am I?"
So you're keeping them?
"As what, some sort of trophy?"
For now.
Then I'll sell them off to a zoo or something.
Why?
Come.
Arrangements for the night is done
Which is your room?
Situation is somewhat like this.
There's only one room
And we spend the night in the same room?
You presume somewhat like that?
How compelling!
- Not quite so compelling
I'm not staying here one minute.
- You take the bed.
I'll take the sofa
No problems.
- No way.
I'm leaving
I'm not joking.
I'm going away.
- And I'll have the bed all to myself?
So nice... so romantic!
And these curtains... so nice!
And the view!
No horses?
It's so warm in here
There!
You have a fire going
Granted.
You have a great sense of choice
"You couldn't find a better place to spend the night, right?"
We were getting a nice room
But you'd rather spend the night with me in the stables.
Not in the room
Eat
And you know it.
"You see, that's where you're wrong, mr."
Enright.
"So, what are you saying?"
You going to do a better job than the world-famous lapd?
If any of these crime scene photos would have shown
"Who took that cuff link,"
I think someone would have noticed by now.
Somebody did notice.
"Eric, take a look at this."
It's the same lady in every one of these photos.
Yes.
Watch this.
"Bang, bang, bang."
That's her again.
She's got...
She's got a camera.
"Eric, she can help us."
"h, in a city as big as l.A.,"
How are we going to find one girl?
This is how.
She's got a press pass.
Olivia burch.
Excuse me.
Captain sutter.
"Enjoying your lunch, lieutenant?"
"Yes, as a matter of fact we are."
"We're doing what we came to los angeles to do, captain."
Then you know you're wasting your time.
That's called clean police work.
Are you suggesting I'm not clean?
"I guess we're about to find out, captain."
Take it easy.
I'm sorry.
Please.
"Hey, Jerry."
"George, you decided to get a rug."
"Good for you, Jack."
"Well, I'm just looking, really."
"Tommy, I'm gonna need a little adjustment."
I'll be right with you.
"Listen, George, I got some bad news."
I'm not gonna be able to give you that parking space.
- What?
- What?
This judge has to use it for some scofflaw.
"And you know, you can't fight city hall."
"You know, Gary I had a little chat with George the other day."
- You didn't!
- I did.
And he told me that...
- I'm not 100 percent recovered yet.
- Give me that thing.
How's your life?
All right?
"Yeah, not bad at all."
"And now, ladies and gentlemen of the press it is my pleasure to introduce you to Mr. Jake Jarmel."
"So, Jake, what's your percentage on this book?"
"Actually, I have some very interesting information on that."
"- You know, this is a co-venture..."
- Where did you get those?
- And as such it...
- Those glasses.
- Where did you get those glasses?
She was calling for help because the wackos had tied her up.
And she took off with them?
-Yeah.
Are you Batman or what?
-I'm...
Should we send the dogs after him?
This is the reality now.
Dad.
I'll be damned.
Dad...
"I'm moving in here, Dad."
I have burnout.
-What?
I need rest.
The only cure for that is to start working.
"You don't like me, Dad."
-Don't say that.
Your tights look good on TV.
You were never happy with the fact that I'm just a firefighter.
You should've done your homework.
You're the one who drove me out before I'd done my homework.
You have no idea what it's like to sit in the garbage all night!
"Like mother, like son."
What would've happened to you and Mom had we not moved here?
"Stop patronizing me, you super sociologist!"
Fine...
I'll go out to play.
The garbage can is on fire!
It's that wacko again.
"-Don't go, he can be unpredictable."
They'll give him a lesson.
Look who's here!
Mostly.
"Are you two lazy bastards gonna get up and help, or what?"
So how do you know Will?
We volunteered together at Amnesty International a couple years ago.
"Yeah, that's right."
"How is the Burmese situation, Tom?"
Better?
I mean good?
"Yeah, and he called me up out of the blue for Christmas lunch."
"So, here I am."
Really?
"So, listen, what's the deal with you and Ellie now?"
Is she your girlfriend?
Are you insane?
Where did you get those trainers?
- Why?
What's wrong with them?
- Nothing.
What?
"By the way, I do think you and Rachel have a shot."
"- I mean, if you don't screw it up."
- Thank you.
I'd created a monster.
Or maybe he created me.
I don't know what Will was so upset about.
All I meant was I don't think couples are the future.
You need more than that.
You need backup.
"The way I saw it, Will and I both had backup now."
It's like that thing he told me Jon Bon Jovi said:
"""No man is an island."""

"He's not feeling well, kids."
I have to call it quits!
That hurt a little on the way out.
- What's this for?
- Careful!
You're going to break it!
"- Don't pull it like that, son."
- What's it for?
For balance.
Maria works with us in the circus.
"No, no."
"From now on, Maria doesn't work anywhere."
"She will simply study and play, right?"
What kind of work?
"She walks along a high wire, way up in the circus ring."
That was in the past.
This whole business about Maria in the circus is all done.
She uses this parasol to help her balance on the tightrope.
Are you her mother?
"No, I'm her godmother."
- What about you?
- I'm her godfather!
Take our picture.
"Right, that's enough."
"Can you walk for us, just a little bit?"
Walk!
Walk!
"Just a little bit, Maria."
Please.
Do you want to walk?
Want to walk the tightrope?
- Who likes magic here?
I would know!
Nothing you see can harm or even touch you.
It's purely audio-visual.
- There's no physical sensation.
- Fuck!
"Yes, there was!"
"- Cooper, you need to calm down."
"- I know because I felt it, okay?"
"I felt her arm, it was warm, and I felt her fucking stab me in the shoulder."
- That's not possible.
"- Oh, my God."
"- It's not possible, Cooper."
"- Yeah, it is!"
"Yeah, it is!"
Physical sensations shouldn't be possible.
"- Unless, I mean..."
"- Oh, God."
Unless what?
I don't know.
"The neuron net, it could have maybe worked out some means of replicating physical experiences,"
- but that would be unprecedented.
- Jesus Christ.
"Okay, you know what?"
Stop the game.
I want out.
Just pull me out now.
"Stop, stop, stop."
Safe word.
Fucking stop!
"- Okay, okay, just let us work it out."
"- Oh, God."
"No, I want this fucking thing out now."
Why should I tell them about her?
Don't know why they had come without even knowing her name?
"Hey, please listen to me..."
I will not.
I don't want to hear flashbacks of split ups.
I like as I'm now.
I feel something fishy.
Why isn't he listening to me?
I suspect him...
Why are you silent?
Do something.
What is your plan?
Why are you staring?
Do something.
What can I do?
I suspect him...
Say something please...
"Check, where is Kalyan?"
Can't you do it yourself?
"What happened, Halwa?"
Was I here only?
"You're here only, right?"
"Though I'm here, I'm not and though I'm not here, I feel I'm here."
Do something.
Something is happening without my knowledge.
Hey!
If you've guts remove the veil and beat me.
"Whether you're in veil or me, I'm getting the stick, right?"
"If you've guts, remove the veil."
"How can I be afraid of you, Halwa?"
I'll tell her everything.
Go ahead.
Let me make sure I understand.
You wanna keep your toothpaste in the tube until you're done brushing.
What are you talking about?
-What are you talking about?
"-Okay, okay."
Let me try again.
I don't wanna frost the cake while I'm still mixing the batter.
I don't get it.
She must have lost a bet.
-Excuse me?
-Nothing.
All right.
Here's what you do.
When you feel like the train is leaving the station... .
"You mean, going in the tunnel?"
"No, no, I mean leaving the station."
But you have to leave the station to get to the tunnel.
"Okay, okay."
Let's start from the top.
"And work our way down, right?"
You know what?
Just shut up and listen.
"When you're making love, the way to slow yourself down is..."
... tothinkof something completely non-sexual.
"-Well, what do you think of?"
-You.
That was a really great dinner.
I'm glad you enjoyed it.
You ready for dessert?
I've been ready since I was 1 4.
I'll be back.
Why don't you put some music on.
And I never left.
Yeah.
"You know, I understand."
You need a little R and R. Recharge the old batteries.
"But you know, after a while, why didn't you go back?"
I fell in love.
- Oh.
- Yep.
- Corvette?
- No.
I fell in love with this.
Whoa.
Look at that.
"Look, they're drivin' right by."
They don't even know what they're missing!
"Well, it didn't used to be that way."
"Oh, yeah?"
Yeah.
"Forty years ago, that Interstate down there didn't exist."
Really?
Yeah.
"Back then, cars came across the country a whole different way."
How do you mean?
The road didn't cut through the land like that Interstate.
"It moved with the land, you know?"
"It rose, it fell, it curved."
- Mornin'!
"- Nice day, huh?"
Cars didn't drive on it to make great time.
They drove on it to have a great time.
"Well, what happened?"
The town got bypassed just to save ten minutes of driving.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
It's a miracle it's still here.
The guys forgot it and didn't lock the car.
Welcome.
Thank you.
You're kind.
"Here, even if your car's gold, no one will touch it."
"Opposite the school, the students are curious."
It's best to lock it.
All right.
Are you in telecommunications?
Telecommunications?
Yes.
This place is a world of communication.
Why're you here?
"Yes, that's obvious."
I've never seen a woman serve before.
Where did you spring from?
What?
"You have parents, don't you?"
Who served your father his tea?
My mother.
Why say you've never seen such a thing?
All women serve.
They have three trades:
"by day, they're workers. ln the evening, they serve and at night they work."
Except for your mother.
Thanks all the same!
I've told you time and again not to park here.
Park next to the engineer.
"When you start it up, you pollute the cafe."
Color me impressed.
This mode's got some serious power.
I'll say.
Let's turn this guy black and blue.
[all grunt] [growls] What?
I'm seeing red.
"Red rangers, it's time to get fired up."
"[grunting] [groaning] [groaning] At least it took five teams to beat me. [argus] If these setbacks continue,"
The prince will lose his mind.
Something must be done.
Leave it to me.
I've been working on something big.
It's a waste to use it on this little planet.
Consider this a test.
[grunts]
Maximizer.
Watch.
We no longer need zombats.
And we can enlarge more than one monster at a time.
[all] Huh? They're doing it without zombats.
Now they can grow four at once?
[alarm signal] That'll be Gosei.
[Gosei] Rangers.
You can see the aliens have new capabilities.
But you have some too.
"Along with your new powers, come new zords and a special skyship."
Summon them.
Thanks.
We're on it.
Summon skyship.
Wow.
Sweet ride.
"- Well, thank you."
And I love your scarf.
Really brings out your vagina.
How come I have never thought of that before?
[ Grunts ]
[ Chuckling ] That's funny.
[ Whispering ] How can she be above me?
Do you realize she's a woman?
- Yes.
Why are we whispering?
- Because they can hear everything!
"- She's a topflight chef, Steven."
She ran her own restaurant.
- Ohhh!
"I don't care if she's a world-class balloonist... who can whistle ""London Bridge Is Falling Down"" out of her ass!"
- This should've been mine!
"- You're preaching to the choir, buddy."
- What?
Pino doesn't trust me?
- Why would he?
You stole his Vicodin.
- We don't need another chef.
"- Yes, we do."
"We're getting slammed, okay?"
And I'm just giving her the scut work.
"You're still my go-to guy, huh?"
You're my right-hand man.
You're the Sundance to my Butch.
"- Oh, good."
So I'm actually in charge.
- No.
What's she ever done that's so great?
I won't say a word.
"It won't be easy, but I promise."
Oh.
"Oh, I'd love to."
"Yes, I'll do some shopping, and then I'll meet you for lunch."
Okay.
Bye.
"- Who was it, honey?"
- Louise.
- What are you so happy about?
- She wants me to meet her for lunch.
"- Oh, boy."
Some life I've given you.
- What do you mean?
"A little thing like going out to lunch, and you're ecstatic."
I'm easy to please.
"I'll just go change, and then I'll drive you to the office."
"Honey, I'm a little late."
Only take a minute.
Darrin.
"Larry, I want to speak to you about the Waterhouse account."
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
"Well, I'm talking to you about it first."
Remember the Hoffsteddler-Douglas account?
"- Yes, but..."
- Before I took over Hoffsteddler hadn't spoken to Douglas in 30 years.
"- You did a fine job there, Darrin."
"- Yes, I did."
And let's not overlook the Michael Sales Company account.
"Before I took charge, they couldn't give away ice water in the middle of the Mojave Desert."
- A memorable job.
"Yes, it was."
I wrote it before I left.
"I got my mum to send it, as an alibi."
E-Eleanor was right.
It was me.
"I'm sorry, Chris."
You convinced me the first time around someone else is going to have to own up.
"For fuck's sake, somebody please!"
"- Come on, don't go all gay on me."
- Fuck's sake.
"- Please, no!"
"- Man up, fella."
"Do you want the truth, Justin?"
Your brother was a creep.
"- No, that's not true!"
"- Yes, it bloody is!"
A creep!
"A weirdo, all twitchy and desperate."
- I thought you were his friends.
- He didn't have any friends.
No one liked him.
None of us.
So you just watched while Chris pushed him around?
I didn't see the fight.
But I saw Felix.
He was upstairs in the bedroom.
Eleanor was going down on me and...
- Felix was watching us.
- What?
"I was getting a blowjob and Felix was standing in the doorway staring at me, with my dick out."
"I told him to get lost, naturally."
"""Get lost, you bloody queer!"" were my exact words, I believe."
Are you saying my brother's queer?
- Who?
Why is this man threatening my husband with a gun?
- Do not allow...
- Shut her up.
"-Get down, you Nazi bitch."
-No no!
"Cookie, Cookie, Cookie!"
No no no no!
Cookie!
Do not!
Do not!
Please do not leave me!
It's a bad plan anyway.
"The best strategy is, to destroy the enemy from within."
He must defeat himself.
"Do not be an enemy, Bishop!"
The personification of the devil is a symbol of all evil.
In the form of humanoids.
"That's you, black blood!"
"Let me go, black blood!"
I'm going to kill them all!
"Just wait, I'll kill you!"
Keep your breath and keep the peace with God.
Shit!
What do the Noids know about God?
You are raised as rats in the laboratory.
Is the color of our blood so different?
Are not we all children of God?
God did not create you.
-We did.
You are an abomination without a soul.
- I am sorry!
"Oh, I'm sure he'd never..."
"- No, that does sound quite like him."
Yeah.
And that's why I want him gone.
"You could be his role model, teach him how to beat it."
"No, no, no."
You've picked the wrong man.
I don't think so.
"Ah, Mitchell, my bro."
- Yes.
- OK.
"Brilliant, brilliant."
"OK, I know we all got off to a bad start but I'm thinking if we all pull together, this could be an interesting, enriching and very brief experience for us all."
"Yeah, level with me, Mitch."
How do you stick it with this sad-arse?
I think you need a new wingman.
"I, sir, am a registered poon hound."
"Have you ever actually had sex, Adam?"
"You know, proper balls-deep sex?"
Have you touched a boob?
"Be honest with me, Adam."
Have you ever even touched a boob?
Because...
Ha-ha-ha!
I have.
Loads!
"Ah, someone doth protest too much."
You don't come near me.
"But, Mitch, we're like brothers in arms."
I'll have a Scotch.
This is near me.
This is where I told you not to be.
"Yeah, it's like a clever little twist."
"The motel's made out of caution cones, which, of course, cars try to avoid."
But now we're gonna stay in them.
That's funny.
"Figure that all out on your own, did you?"
"Cone number one, if you want."
Oh...
"Hey, do I spy a little pinstriping tattoo back there?"
Oh...
That's just a...
Oh!
"Oh, you saw that?"
Yeah.
Just gonna be going.
Gonna...
Yeah.
"You know, I knew this girl Doreen."
Good-lookin' girl.
"Looked just like a Jaguar, only she was a truck!"
"You know, I used to crash into her, just so I could spoke to her."
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.
"Hey, I know somethin' we can do tonight, 'cause I'm in charge of watching' you!"
"No, Mater, I gotta finish this road, and I have to get out of here."
"Well, that's all right, Mr. I Can't Turn On Dirt."
You probably couldn't handle it anyway.
"Whoa, whoa, easy now, Mater."
You know who you're talkin' to?
This is Lightning McQueen.
I can handle anything.
- I'm not doin' this.
- Come on.
I don't know where it is.
"Well, maybe you could find it."
"3,000 bucks."
"Well, that will get me back, but not in style."
I can get you another two when we get to the States.
"It's important, Marion."
Trust me.
You know the piece I mean?
Do you know where it is?
Come back tomorrow.
Why?
"Because I said so, that's why."
Ha!
"See you tomorrow, Indiana Jones."
"Good evening, Fraulein."
The bar's closed.
We...
We are... not thirsty.
What do you want?
The same thing your friend Dr. Jones wanted.
Surely he told you there would be other interested parties.
Must've slipped his mind.
The man is... nefarious.
"I hope, for your sake, he has not yet acquired it."
"Why, are you willing to offer more?"
"Oh, almost certainly."
Do you still have it?
No.
But I know where it is.
"Hey, how about a drink for you and your men?"
Your fire is dying here.
Why don't you tell me where the piece is right now?
"That lady cop from the Bomb Squad... got you the stuff to do this with, didn't she?"
You didn't know Monica was gonna be here.
"Did you, Figgs?"
No.
Monica said she was going over to her friend's house to watch some pay-per-view.
The thing was on a timer.
"I didn't know she was gonna be here, Freddy."
It's all bullshit.
"You, Figgs, are the bullshit!"
Smarten fuckin' up!
You even turned your back on Tunney when he needed your help!
Figgs!
"I'm gonna find Superboy, and I'm gonna bring him in!"
"And for once, everybody in this town's gonna tell the truth!"
"- You gotta find him first, Freddy!"
- I'll find him.
Listen to me.
"I got a check in my pocket for $200,000."
I got a chance to start my life again.
I don't give a shit about this town!
I don't give a shit about that town.
And I don't give a shit about your fucking justice!
"Bein' right is not a bulletproof vest, Freddy!"
"Go on, Figgsy!"
Go on!
Run away!
"Hey, Freddy."
- Ray's not home.
- I know.
I'm lookin' for your nephew.
I don't know where he is.
Why the hell would I tell you if I did?
You've seen that old knife Eric always has?
Maybe.
"Certainly, as far as weapons go, it's worthless."
"When I look at him, I wonder why is he trying to survive as long as he can?"
I have a feeling I might understand.
There's no need to ask.
The job of the hunter is not to protect.
But he exists to protect someone.
Who are you trying to protect by going after him?
Good Lord.
The coffee's gone ice cold.
I'm a silly old fool.
Forgive me for going on like that.
"How about a cup, young lady?"
"My special blend's pretty good, you know."
Go on.
It will do you good.
"Stop calling me ""young lady."""
The name's Makoto.
"All right, fair enough."
"As long as you promise not to call me a boring, old cont."
What is that?
I have no idea!
What is it?
Why all the ruckus?
MAN:
Mandurugo.
"Mandurugo, what are they?"
Winged vampires native to the Philippines.
Aim for the heart!
Make each shot count!
These silver bullets aren't cheap!
"But then again, I do look good in purple."
Are you sure?
No cites for a loose load on the Golden State?
Of course.
Baker and Poncherello.
They came in this morning.
They didn't respond to the dispatches because they're not on their bikes.
They're at Poncherello's.
Does anybody have Poncherello's phone number?
Yeah.
I shouldn't have let them go home.
I shouldn't have...
I'm too nice a guy.
That's it.
I'm just too nice a guy.
You go to the drive-in very often?
I don't have to.
I can watch it from right here.
Saves me a fortune.
How do you know what's going on?
You can't hear it.
"Well, during the winter, you kind of have to figure it out, read lips."
"But during the summer, all the car windows are open."
It's like stereo.
"Hey, how do I get my nickel back out of here?"
Mr. Nice Guy.
I'm gonna have my name legally changed to Mr. Nice Guy.
"Boy, never again."
Never again.
"- Hey, sarge..."
"- Later, Park, later, later."
"This is your noon news update, Larry McCormick reporting."
Do you guys want to go see a movie?
Ooh. hold on. hold on.
Hello?
Check your bank account. your money's back.
It's georgina.
Georgina where are you?
what happened to poppy?
You don't have to worry about her ever again.
You got your money. that's all that matters.
- Now you can go to yale. - well i'm going to n.y.u. now.
Oh. great. then i'll see you next year.
Wait. what does that mean?
Hello?
georgina?
What?
Georgina sparks?
Yes that's right.
I recently enrolled in gallatin.
Here's my paperwork and my check.
Thank you miss sparks.
Is there anything else?
I'd like to request a roommate-- blair waldorf.
She's my best friend and i just can't wait to live with her.
Serena.
Carter.
Aren't you supposed to be in dubayy?
You know you can't lose me for long. where you headed?
Everywhere.
I have something you might want to know before you go.
I hope it doesn't have to do with blair.
No it has to do with you.
It's about santorini what you were looking for there.
Because I am the man.
And that's the man's job.
Good news.
You may unbuckle your safety belt and move freely about the house.
Tyler is leaving.
What?
"Oh, thank God!"
Where's he going?
He and Clem are driving down to Tijuana.
What?
No!
No!
No!
- They are not!
"- Oh, I'm sure they'll be fine."
I gave them a whole bunch of cash and my dusty wallet condom.
And the mother bear's off to protect her cub.
"Tijuana, here we come."
(car engine starts)
- Oh!
- Oh!
Get out of the car.
You are not going to Tijuana.
You listen to me.
"Tijuana is a low-down dirty place where anything goes, which is why I love it."
But you cannot go because you are still a child.
So are you.
I think we can agree my childhood ended with that text.
"Okay, you know what?"
Listen.
I love your dad very deeply and I work hard to make sure that our marriage is strong and our love life is spicy.
And I don't feel like I should have to apologize for that.
Because of his son?
Greg had a fling with Hillie.
A fling?
It seemed like he loved her.
"He loves a lot of the girls, but he's not gonna get serious with someone like Hillie."
His father would kill him.
"Stephanie, would you keep this to yourself for the moment?"
Of course.
Thanks.
- The blue one.
- What?
That's the dress you should bury her in.
The blue one with the bow.
"[ Al ] It's right here, Sam."
It's in the closet.
How long have you been there?
"Uh, well, long enough to know that you think Greg's old man murdered Hilla."
Or maybe Greg.
I thought the kid was in love with her.
"According to her diary, she met someone new."
She broke it off with Greg on the Fourth ofJuly.
"Well, maybe they made up again."
I don't know.
"After the fourth, there are no new entries."
Except she did put this in there.
What is it?
A blood test result.
Her beta H.C.G. was positive.
Uh-huh.
"Speak English, will ya?"
"Two people died in that lake, Al."
Hilla was pregnant.
"You're just jealous, Peku."
"You're a fucking tease, bitch!"
I'll tell everyone not to talk to you.
You're a traitor!
And you can donate this virginity barometer to the nuns!
Can't you just wear women's clothes?
This is so embarrassing.
You're the one going through people's grocery bags!
How do I look?
-Like a pervert dying to get laid.
Dad...
"You didn't have to, honey..."
I'll fight for you.
You picked these in the yard.
I rang your doorbell.
I brought you flowers.
Tore them from the ground.
I worked!
"I humiliated myself for you, Marjukka."
-Oh boy...
You're insatiable!
"I've got something better in sight, you stupid monkey!"
"You've got a guy here, I can smell it."
Go or I'll ask your Mom to get you.
Tell him to come out.
Hello.
Garbage Jesse!
"This won't do, Jesse."
You're far too crazy.
And lemma hates you.
I'm beginning to understand why.
L---
- I need your help.
- Oh.
You're not gonna handle this one on your own?
"You just couldn't help yourself, could you?"
"Sadly, no."
"Take Doug back to the loft, lock him down tight."
"- You can handle that, right?"
- Have I ever let you down?
"- Be careful, Fi."
"- Don't worry, Michael."
I never let my guard down.
What the hell do you mean you can't get ahold of her?
She doesn't have some kind of-
Yeah?
All right.
"Well, keep trying."
"Mike, she's in some kind of a meeting with a new client that just called this morning."
"I mean, it might be nothin'."
"It's not gonna be nothin', Sam."
- Hello.
"- Michael, if I had known... you were this much fun to work with..."
I would have come to Miami sooner.
I'm glad one of us is having fun.
"You're not missing the damsel in distress, are you?"
"Michael, my son."
I'm afraid.
"Please, Michael."
Please.
- You changed.
- This is more my style.
"Oh, for crying out loud."
I'm not gonna shoot you here.
Agreeing to have sex with someone you haven't even met.
"Grace, what's going on?"
Where are you?
"Uh, at a hair salon."
"In fact, I-I have to go."
Bye.
"- It's Neil, right?"
"- Yes, Neil."
"Oh, he is gorgeous."
"Strong chin, warm eyes."
Whew.
I can almost taste him.
Adriana never sent anyone to meet me before.
Why now?
"Oh, it's just something we do for our most valued clients to ensure you have the most enjoyable experience."
I'm flattered.
"So give me a sense of what you're looking for, and how you envision your night with Neil."
Do you mean like the perfect date?
Sure.
Let's start there.
I want to fall in love.
It's not just about the sex.
It's about the before.
And the after.
"Lying there in messy sheets, drinking him in while he tells charming stories."
Running fingers through his hair as he soaks in a steaming hot bath.
You know.
Yes.
I think I do.
"This one, Adriana says is one of her best."
So I hear.
Neil.
You're a guy.
"Well, you used to be."
"So, what do you think?"
I've still got it.
-Why did you get me this?
-What is it?
"It's yelling, bleeding, dilating."
"Oh, the dilating!"
Is this the video of the birth?
It's Phoebe's.
Why were you watching it?
I thought maybe you got me porn for Valentine's Day.
If you thought I was gonna get you porn for Valentine's Day..
you were right.
It's about a girl who moves to the city in search of stardom..
but ends up having sex with a lot of guys.
It got four stars.
Wait a minute.
Those aren't stars.
"-Anyway, you wanna take a look?"
-Well..
-I'm not really in a sexy mood.
"-Hey, what's going on?"
Remember the first time you saw Jaws..
how long it took to go back in the water?
We can't let this tape wreck Valentine's Day.
You gotta get past it.
Just get back on the horse.
"Otherwise, the horse is gonna go into the bedroom and change into her sweatpants."
"-Okay, you don't know."
You didn't see it.
-Childbirth is beautiful.
Don't get sore.
"Oh, I'm not sore."
I suppose it's natural for a chap to be a bit edgy before his first jump.
Is it?
Everybody is.
"It's nothing to do with, well, being frightened, you know?"
That's interesting.
"There, now you can stop worrying and relax."
It's a special I keep on one side.
It's the best chute I ever packed.
Good.
I wouldn't like to have to repack it on the way down.
"Hey, what's your name?"
Gardner.
What Gardner?
Just Gardner.
Working girls don't have Christian names.
I haven't seen you around.
I don't get around.
"Oh, officer material?"
I said we work here.
"On your way, Mr Maple Leaf."
"Left, right, left, right..."
Squad halt!
"One, two."
Fall out.
"Take the ropes, Corporal Dawes."
"All right, who's going to have the first go?"
No ugly rush now.
All right.
We'll have to pick out volunteers for the first stick.
"Canada, suppose you show us how it's done?"
"Uh, the ring is like the cloak that Harry Potter wears to sneak around Hogwarts."
"Yeah, I don't speak virgin either."
The ring-- it makes you invisible.
You're not precious.
"Oh, good, you're awake."
"Look, Ted, there's something we have to talk about."
Boundaries?
Invasion of privacy?
Losing your key privileges?
"It's about the 20-year-old, Ted."
You have to bang her.
For me!
Why do you want me to hook up with this 20-year-old?
I thought I disgusted you.
"Yeah, that was all an act."
"Look, look, look, I love Robin and she's the only girl I want to be with."
But my body is detoxing after years of one-night stands.
"They don't make gum or a patch for this, Ted."
"But, hey, billion-dollar idea alert."
"Oh, yeah."
That's okay.
I'll just buy a new dream journal.
What-what-what are you looking for?
Your phone.
There's got to be some pictures of her in here.
Damn it.
No.
Those are all worthless.
"I need some one-night-stand material, Ted."
Oh.
Oh.
Here's your mom.
- Who the fuck are you?
Why do we care what you think?
"What are you, an intern?"
Yes.
What about that last intern?
"She had those bug eyes, looked like Courtney Cox on chemo."
Let me give you two pieces of advice:
Always wear black and... you never finish shitting until you piss again.
Remember that and you'll be fine here.
"- Thank you, I'll keep it in mind."
- I'm just busting your balls!
- Come on!
- You can laugh!
"- I like her vibe, though!"
- Nice vibe.
Good vibe!
Come visit me in my office and...
We'll chat sometime.
A little less rouge.
Are we working or are we chatting?
Pardon me?
Yeah!
Obviously you!
Who else would I be talking to?
"- Rocky, the camera man?"
"- Director ""odd"" Photography."
"Oh, great!"
Come here now!
Chop-chop!
You remember when I asked you to do a special project for me?
- Did you see it...
"- Yeah, I saw it!"
Saiba.
We buried their warriors so the Paathars sent women?
It's a woman who shall kill Jilaan.
Muraakis give only one chance.
"This full moon night, we shall conquer Paatharghat."
"Conquer me, and you conquer Paatharghat."
Who are you?
Doom.
"Barbaric Muraaki, you have never been this close to a woman, have you?"
Get lost.
I've come to kill you.
You will have to defeat me to win me over.
Show me your face.
Why do you need to see my face to fight with me?
I need a reason to fight.
Then lower your gaze.
Why?
Saiba's beauty is like the sun...
It's wise to lower your gaze.
You got a reason to fight.
Now do you have the courage to fight?
Just her and me.
Jungle Trap.
This is your Paathar's dense jungle.
A huge tree at the end.
And a dagger on the top.
The first one to get the dagger gets to draw blood.
"If I draw your blood, you give up on Paathar."
And what if I draw yours?
My Ghat will belong to you and so will I.
Jungle Trap.
"One hundred paths, One hundred wrong ones."
You bought stock with a bad check.
That's fraud.
People go to prison for things like that.
Never mind the sermon.
Have you got the check?
Let's talk about a better arrangement.
Alright.
Call your shots.
And so I can.
I'm now your junior partner.
An interest in the business to be mutually agreed on.
What if I say no?
Then you don't get the check.
You've got a deal.
It's lucky the bank teller was a girl I've known for several years.
"You know, a man called Thornston Weblin once said business is the art of getting something for nothing."
Yes?
Hello.
Is Mr. Sabourin here?
"Yes, he is, madam."
I'm Mrs. Ryan.
He's expecting me.
"You know, the only thing I don't like about this painting is the face."
"Oh, well, we'll have the face changed for you."
Hello.
Hello.
This is Miss Howell of the real estate office.
Mrs. Ryan.
How do you do?
What is this all about?
"I'm buying this house, if you approve."
Louis XIV?
"Yeah, wrap it up."
"-Get the fuck out the car, bitch!"
"-Motherfucker, you know who I am?"
Who the fuck is this?
You know who the fuck I'm with?
"You ain't no fucking cop, that's for sure."
-The fuck you going to do with that?
-Stick it up your mother's twat!
Goddamn it!
What?
Little piece of shit.
"The cork, it got stuck in the bottle."
Homemade crap.
That somebody cared enough about to carry all the way from the old country for you.
What a fucking week.
"I talked to Ronnie, asked her if she's even heard from Ralph."
Little fucking kid's got a respiratory infection now.
"She just heard about Pie-O-My, she's sick about it."
Hello?
We're talking about Justin here.
"Sorry, I was thinking about my mother, her skin condition."
"Oh, my God."
Did I forget to take that out?
What's wrong with you?
"Really, Ma."
Dad's right.
It's not a bad drive.
It's interstate up to Boston.
"If you don't want to accompany me,fine."
Your sister can come up from Florida.
"Come on, she's not going to do that."
Of course I'll go.
We're right behind You.
The promising claim.
"Is not an option, And once again,"
Captain kris is forced to go Back to the drawing board.
That means we're not Working tomorrow.
That's what that means.
"It pisses me off, man."
That's life.
"Man, I can't win."
It just seems like I can't stop.
From getting screwed over On a daily basis.
"Under the command Of captain kris,"
The kellys have secured Second place on the scoreboard.
Today is our first Day of mining.
"Go find us Lots of gold, zeke!"
It's gonna be fun.
You need to come up Immediately.
Now I'm starting To get worried.
I can't see over here.
"Take my hand, zeke!"
I am a miner!
[buzzes] [faint infant crying]
[crying continues]
[London] Chip!
I can't.
It won't stop crying.
- She.
She won't stop crying.
"- Yes, ""she."""
I'm not cut out for this.
We made a huge mistake.
I've ever had in my life.
I went into the bathroom.
To get some aspirin... and I happened.
To look in the mirror... and...
I swear to God...
I see something...
I can't describe.
But it sure as hell... is not my reflection.
And then...
I hear... this weird... howl... coming out of the sink.
And there's a voice.
It's a voice... and it's saying...
"""Do not be afraid."
Ninety-nine will die.
"Denver Nine""."
I even wrote it down.
He just keeps saying the same thing over and over for an hour... and then it stops.
And when I wake up this morning I look at this piece of paper... }where I wrote down the words... and this thing is on it.
I did not draw that.
Denver 9.
99 they will die.
- Gordon?
- What?
"Gordon, you..."
your ear's bleeding.
"This CAT scan is clean, Gordon."
No sign of any physical problem.
Are you sure?
Because this man's wife had a tumor.
"What you had, Gordon, was a first-class migraine."
- I can write you a prescription.
- That'd be good.
Why did you take so long?
I have been expecting you.
I will explain...
I will explain the reason for my visit.
Reasons do not matter.
I only want you to answer some questions about...
It will be best for you to ask nothing.
Can you pour me a drink?
a...drink?
Double?
If you like.
Double.
I only want you to answer one question.
Would you like it if I told you...that I like you?
What do you know about her?
"Oh, you are refering to the murdered girl."
The same.
I know many things.
Tell me.
"I know she was a model, who came to a swimsuit designer's convention."
What else.
And that she was murdered.
The only thing I don't know is who did it.
Are you satisfied?
"No, I am not."
"Surely, you will be."
S.O.S.
he is in the elevator.
its stoped on the second floor.
"Open up, Laura."
Need something?
I want some info on the murdered girl.
The League of Nations will thank you!
"What I said was, how will I benefit?"
The entire human race will be grateful!
That means I won't benefit at all.
"Oh, there's US$500,000 too!"
"US$500,000?"
We'll share it fifty-fifty.
"For the human race, for the world, I will help you."
Come what may!
What do I have to do?
You have to steal a Formula.
Where from?
From Fat Pig's house!
What?
You want me to steal from my boss!
You want me to lose my job?
I'll get my provident fund in 20 years' time!
"Do you want that in 20 days, you will be enjoying California's sunshine."
Inspector!
What is it?
The Commissioner and his family will be going out tomorrow.
He wants you to tighten up security.
No problem.
Tell him to go in peace.
I will take charge personally.
I'll stand guard tonight.
You come as the burglar.
Then we'll be able to get it.
"Over here, get in."
Hurry!
Yoyo looks great.
Beginning to take after me!

"Right, OK."
Anyone else won't stand for it?
Raise your hand if you won't stand for it.
"That is good to know because we do need to make some redundancies, so you're all fired."
What?
I was stretching!
I will stand for it.
We need to reduce spending pretty urgently.
"I'm afraid it's a case of 'no pain, no grain'."
"Yeah, Prof, the company bought this gold jug for the tournament later."
Mm-hm.
"So we'll need a bit more pain, then."
Sorry.
Let's lose...
the guy with the monobrow and Lena the cleaner.
What?
You can't fire Lena!
Why are you still here?
"End of meeting, everyone back to work."
Apart from those who've been sacked.
You have to go.
Now.
Not even fixed the squeaky door!
"Mmm, fish eggs."
Cor.
Workers united will never be defeated!
The workers united will never be defeated!
"Oh, no, please!"
I'm a worker too!
I'm working very hard here!
Lena's worked here for 45 years.
"So she probably needs a rest, then!"
"Yes, it is."
Hey I'm sorry man I forgot.
You people don't have deserts and this dry heat do take some getting used to.
Especially if you're going to be wearing suits out here.
Especially if you're going to be wearing suits out here.
Mr. Jenkins.
Yeah?
We are busy men.
Me too.
So you do know what we need.
Oh yeah.
Nick you said you have some big stuff you need greased through the boarder.
Yes.
"Well I handle the number three artery into California, the night shift."
I could smuggle through a heard of elephants if I had enough capital.
That's true.
Billy here is the very best.
He's your man.
So what do we move?
So what do we move?
"When the time comes, we'll let you know."
"Sure thing, konnichiwa."
I've been studying.
I might be playing baseball in Tokyo next year.
I'll call you.
"Ok, partner."
All right.
So what do you think?
He was nervous.
"It's a big opportunity, anyone would be."
Are you sure about him?
Absolutely.
Hey!
Slip this from my wallet from me while proposing to me?
Fuck you!
You left it in my tip jar the other night.
Bullshit.
- I thought you wanted me to have it.
I...
"- Cut the crap, Stevie."
- What is a big deal about a goddamn picture?
- They say that the guy in the photo doesn't exist.
This says he does.
"Trevor, Trevor, I don't understand what the fuck you are talking about."
I'm talking about your ex!
Ivan.
- Who?
This guy standing next to you with a fish?
- I'm not in that photo.
"Trevor, I'm looking at a picture of you."
You're standing next to some fat guy with glasses holding a fish.
That's not me.
"Trevor, it's you."
Look.
You lying whore.
You get the fuck out.
Fucking freak.
You play that fucking well!
You fucking whore!
You fucking freak.
Now I know why you're afraid of doctors.
'Cause you're a fucking psycho!
My ex...
Fucking psycho.
You're under arrest!
Get on the ground!
Get on your stomach now!
On your stomach!
Get on the ground!
Hold it right there.
Don't move.
Stay down.
I had a good job until my boss accused me of stealing.
I'd better call Saul!
"I was out partying, minding my own business..."
- You are under arrest.
- I'd better call Saul!
"Hi, I'm Saul Goodman."
Did you know that you have rights?
The Constitution says you do.
And so do I.
"I believe that until proven guilty every man, woman, and child in this country is innocent."
"And that's why I fight for you, Albuquerque."
Better call Saul.
"Saul Goodman, attorney at law, 505-1 64-CALL."
That's 505-1 64-CALL.
I really need to get some furniture.
I suggest you start with a bed.
"God, I wish we could smoke in here."
"- Well, you can't."
"- Yeah, no."
I know.
I'm just saying.
Don't think I can't smell that weed.
You better seriously hope that airs out.
My dad will keep your security deposit.
"Whatever the case, she... fell in love with someone else."
Who?
A man she used to work with.
I didn't know him.
I only saw him once.
From a distance.
They died in a car accident.
How does your daughter figured that it's your fault?
"Well, my daughter didn't know about the affair."
She blamed me for the breakup.
And consequently the... car accident.
Well... did you ever tell her the whole story?
- No.
- Why not?
Because I want her to remember her mother the way she does now.
That's stupid!
You're stupid!
- Thank you.
- Does your daughter like Barbie Sunday?
- What?
- Does your daughter like Barbie Sunday?
Very much.
"Well, at least she did somethin' right."
"Now, I'm gonna get some bullets and we've done with all these."
Tell Violet.
"You like my partner, don't you?"
What's not to like?
She's....a sweet girl.
Do you like her better than me?
I don't know you as well.
That's okay.
I like her better than me too.
- Here.
Then divide it up!
I'll make piles!
It doesn't work out this time either.
"Ah, here!"
No big green ones?
"- None, really?"
"- No, really."
It's just that green is good for the eyes.
"Wait, I can't count it."
... eighty... ninety and two fifties.
- Two fifties and ninety is...
- Two fifties for each...
Wait!
"You must do something with this, it's torn//falling to pieces, soon we won't have anything to play from."
"Look, there's something here!"
I knew it.
Good to see.
That's super.
It'll save us.
It's the first time that's happened!
Such a good job!
Yes!
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- A terrible thing's happened to us.
- And what's that?
We were sewing a dress for Mi?
"ka for a party on Saturday, we wanted to hurry it up, so we thought we'd do it ourselves."
"Put it on, so that we can see..."
"She cut it out, got it ready, and now we need to be rescued."
This for a party?
I wouldn't.
Now put the gun down.
- Oh!
- You shot him!
- Are you okay?
I'm sorry I shot you.
I thought that's what the nod meant.
- It was.
It was awesome.
"It was actually just like the end of ""Speed,"""
which is a pretty good movie.
"It's not as good as ""Die Hard."" ""Die Hard""'s perfect."
"- Okay, Jake, I'm gonna go after Figgis."
"- Yeah, I was gonna say, you should keep going after Figgis."
"Same page, still."
- Get out of the car!
- Young Jeezy take the wheel!
"- Freeze, punk!"
"- Yeah, freeze, punk!"
"- Gina, where did you get that gun?"
- Lost and found at the storage facility.
They have boxes of 'em.
They're everywhere.
"- Hey, Figgis."
"My fiancé, Adrian Pimento, said when I caught you,"
I should read you this letter.
"""I want to lick the skin off your body, baby."""
"Oh, that side's for me."
"""I want to rip the skin off your body, Jimmy."""
"- We're sorry we doubted you, sir."
You really saved our butts.
- I can't take credit for that.
It's not staph.
The infection could be limited to a brain abscess.
Which I would have seen in your MRI.
Sign this so that I can take out a piece of your brain.
Let me see the MRI.
There was no abscess on the image.
"Let me see it, then."
I liked you better when you were jolly.
MRI was taken over an hour ago.
That soft spot could now be an abscess.
"If it was staph, you'd have a fever."
Which you don't!
101.6.
What idiot gave you that?
Put the omaya reservoir in my skull and treat me for the staph.
Triangle.
This one?
Uh... circle.
Next.
"Foreman, why aren't you answering?"
Is there a problem?
"Uh, s-square."
Tell me your date of birth.
Is that House?
- Yeah.
Next.
A square again.
Why is he here?
Because my neurologist is having surgery.
Thought I was just another patient.
"You didn't believe that crap, did you?"
Date of birth.
-You got change of 20?
"-Oh, yes, sir."
What's your number again?
-82.
-82.
I put your number ahead of the other guys.
"-Thank you, sir."
-I like the way you work.
"All right, let me look at that robe a minute, will you?"
"Get this polished while you're down there, too."
"This may be a little gaudy for the Waldorf, but in certain sections of Manila, may I tell you...?"
"Hey, look, kid, uh, where's the latri-- uh, the shower?"
"Right over there, sir."
"Be a little indecent, showering alone."
You're all right.
-Did I get your number?
-82.
"Yeah, all right."
"Oh, I want this suit pressed."
I want those creases you can cut butter with.
I'll do it right away.
"Wait, hold it, this is the important..."
See these stripes?
"When you steam it, don't get 'em up."
You know what I mean?
-Keep 'em nice and shiny.
-I certainly w...
Six stripes?
"Well, you're a master sergeant."
How do you know?
Were you in the service?
"Oh, yes, sir, I was a lieutenant."
Sir is calling.
Must be the wife's massage.
Today I'm on duty.
Otherwise someone like you has never been spared by me.
Get his information and let him go.
You came out to be intelligent.
You don't look like one.
But you are.
But How did you put the gun in my bag?
I'm shocked.
You were standing before me and I was standing behind you.
You were standing before me and I was standing behind you.
You were looking on your left your left.
I came slowly...
"but that bag of yours, it was in the left."
"Here is your gun, and listen."
You met me here.
Don't meet me there.
Understood?
"I don't take help, not even from my father."
You know my nature.
But I know your nature.
Your size is 52 but you wear 48.
"How do you know, Sir?"
"If it was 52, wouldn't you be adjusting again and again."
"Okay, tell me which room is under my name."
"Your name, Sir?"
Laxminarayan.
Okay
Listen.
A letter is suppose to arrive on my name.
"One minute, let me check."
"So, get over here as fast as you can."
What the...?
Where'd she go?
"What terrible sin did you commit, to be yelling like that?"
Are you feeling sick?
Keep having weird dreams.
Who's the medicine for?
Hyo-jin's not feeling well.
She couldn't go to school.
She's burning up.
And where were you while she was so sick?
I was getting her medicine.
What's with you?
Take her to the hospital.
What on earth was that?
Turn off the hose first.
Moron...
"Just coming into work now, are you?"
Hyo-jin wasn't feeling well.
So now you're blaming your daughter?
I'm not making it up.
Did you find your witness?
"No, sir."
After turning the whole town upside down.
You think this case is going to be your big break?
Seong-bok's been calling around.
That's your excuse?
Look at him.
He can't even wash the car.
Driving me up the wall.
Even the Chief heard about your witness.
"Whether you lied, or let her get away- you're screwed."
"Not very much, Father."
It's just been bothering me for 15 years.
What did you do with those fountain pens you stole?
- Rocky!
You old...
"- Jerry, glad to see you."
- What do you hear?
What do you say?
- I'm glad to see you.
Good to see you.
Fifteen years.
Hasn't changed a bit.
- You remember Father Boyle's old sacristy.
- Remember it?
He used to stand right where you are and boil the tar out of me.
"Gosh, 15 years."
It doesn't seem possible I haven't seen you in that length of time.
- I've seen you.
- You have?
Where?
I was there when you made the 90-yard run against NYU.
- Why didn't you come back and see me?
- Some people were waiting for me.
- Oh.
"Well, I got a kick coming, though."
- You have?
What?
- Why haven't you written to me?
"- You know how it is, Jerry."
"I changed my address and number so often, you had no way to answer me."
You know what happens to letters written in the stir.
Everybody reads them.
They're getting very close.
Blake!
How did you get back so soon?
Get ready to leave.
There's a ship coming up on you fast.
You've got about three minutes.
"We have the neutrotope now, nothing else matters."
- I'll get the others.
- I'll be back in a minute.
He's cutting it too fine.
"Come on Blake, get out of there."
"No, no I won't!"
- She must be taken back for trial.
- Agreed.
I won't go!
- Everything set?
"- Yes, ready."
Bring us across Vila.
They're locked on.
[EXPLOSION]
What was that?
I rigged a charge on the entry hatch.
"Right, I think we can get you all home now."
"Zen, set a course for Destiny, speed standard by six."
Confirmed.
Take us round the easy way this time.
Hello?
"You weren't at work today, were you, Elizabeth?"
Waiting for my call?
"Look, you've won"
I'm leaving Don't go
"What you think we're, stupid?"
Yes !
Same me to you!
"Oh, can you believe him?"
"Look at here , Daze."
Barbie Sunday has a new fashion line.
Be your best in my new signature dress.
"Let them know you mean business at the disco or in the boardroom , with the amazing versatility of the premier piece in my high-end line of super stylish couture ."
"Who is better than you, girl ?"
Oh man !
How much is it ?
About 300 bucks.
How do you know ?
"I know, because Stacy Cold Pepper has got one and everybody was talking about it."
Let's get us ours'.
We can't.
Why not?
Because we blew the money on rent again.
"Still, we might still have enough for just one dress and then maybe ..."
What?
"Again , Vi ?"
Call Russ back before he gives the job away.
We got it.
But...
He said it was an easy gig.
right?
Yea.
"Up the money too, didn't he?"
Yea.
Then what are we waiting for?
That's shit!
"Hey Russ, it's me , Daisy."
Congratulations.
I though this was what you always wanted.
"To get back to Norway, get out into the field again."
If you's rather stay here just until the end of hostilities then go and see your wife and children.
It's no problem.
I can...
Of course not.
The war is not over yet.
"- Thank you, Sir."
- Good man.
"- Well, you're certainly not going to miss the fish."
You don't get a fish this colour in Norway.
- No we don't.
I can't.
It must be very beautiful this time of year.
It's always beautiful.
Do you know what I miss most about Norway?
The horizons.
- Whereever you look.
- Yeah.
It's been awhile.
You must come and visit.
Our house is big.
It would be awkward.
"I might go back to university, do another degree."
That's a good idea.
This country needs good birdwatchers.
Certainly does.
It's going to be strange not to have the war.
Yes.
- When do you leave?
- Tomorrow.
I'll find a ride home.
No fair.
How come he can leave?
Nobody's leaving!
We just got here.
Our fun is only starting.
Let's hit that hill!
Yay!
Last one to the bottom is a rotten...
Fuck!
Ice-ball!
Goddamn it!
"If you cross my path today, Murphy,"
"I will scalp you, shit in the scalp, and slap it back on your head so everybody calls you ""shit wig"" and..."
- Hey!
"- Oh, man, don't hurt me!"
Yeah!
You better run from me!
"I'm afraid of your wife, you out-of-work pussyfart!"
"You see that, Sue?"
Everybody knows.
I can't even intimidate children anymore.
"Don't let him bother you, Frank."
He'll be in jail soon.
We can still have fun.
Smile a little!
"I'm trying, but I'm sick of all these busybodies looking at me like I have a fatal disease."
"""Oh, you poor man, how's the job hunt going?"""
"""I don't know, lady, how's your saggy tits going?"""
It's all in your head.
People love you.
"Come on, cheer up."
"Yes, of course."
"You know, it's funny what a difference the flip of a coin will make."
"If you hadn't lost that silver dollar that night, i would've had fleurique, and you would've had josie."
"Oh, sergeant!"
"Yes, sir."
That cherry hill gang are coming over here looking for a scrap.
Cherry hill?
Yeah.
My bowery boys will be glad to hear that.
Ahem!
"Sorry, sir."
There must be some way we can give these bullies a party without getting our uniforms all torn up.
"Anyway, place a sentry around the ferry dock."
Have them give us a signal.
"Yes, sir."
"Here they come, colonel."
Keep that music going.
You all know what do do.
And remember... no knives or guns.
"Only clubs and iron bars for cherry hill, sir."
"Come on, uncle daniel, up you get."
Come on.
Up you go.
Come on.
Turn her on!
You want mr.
Daniel drew?
Yeah!
Come up and get him!
Cease firing!
Hooray!
"That'll get 'em, huh?"
You'll have your old moniker again and I'll choose a Lady for your mansion.
Three full moons?
When she lays eyes on me she'll forget Henry and throw herself in my arms.
Just think of all the hardship in store for you!
The hard work will kill you.
That witch foretold deeds worthy of my heroic ancestors.
I'll earn the favours of the lady of my head.
Lady?
ls the girl worth it?
So many high-born ladies were ready to care for you.
But there's only one Elisa.
You'll have to walk the rest of the way... and such a way!
"No more la French, now you're a commoner."
And you must walk like this...
I see.
Like this?
"That's it, your Grace."
Like a folk hero!
What's that?
Damned dog!
What's that?
Crazy swans... help...
Murder!
Shot in the back!
"She's high and dry, poor thing."
Whatcher doing?
"Not water, no!"
It's water she needs!
Help!
Somebody's coming!
"Horrible monster, go away!"
What are you doing?
Who cares?
He just came to finish off the relationship with Grandma.
- Hello!
- Hello!
Thank you.
Why didn't you tell us... about Uncle?
I wish I had known.
When we found out... about Uncle... we all cried.
"Looking at Nagasaki, it's hard to believe this is where the bomb was dropped."
"People do forget everything, and so quickly, too."
But I will never forget!
"Say, let's go back there once more."
"You mean, that school?"
Yes.
Let's go to Grandpa's place.
Where is Nagasaki?
We can't see it yet.
It's on the other side of that mountain.
I wonder what happened to the children?
They didn't want to meet Clark.
That's for sure.
It's all our fault.
Our... stupidity.
But Clark...
We didn't think that.
"Clark, is there any place that you would like to see in Nagasaki?"
"Yes, there is."
"So, we'll go to the hotel, and then..."
I don't need a hotel.
I'm going to stay at Aunty's place.
"Before that, there's a place I'd like to see."
The place where Uncle died.
"J ust don't even speak to me, okay?"
I can't believe you can't even be nice to me at a time like this!
Why do you even need me to be nice to you... since everybody else in the world is?
Graham. ls that you?
They said the pizza will be here in twenty minutes.
I'm not hungry.
Graham?
"No, it's me."
I'm just calling to thank you.
Thank me?
For what?
For sending Graham over here.
I don't know how you knew... but he is exactly who I needed.
Good.
How is it going?
How is Andy?
We don't-
- We're still waiting to hear if the angioplasty worked.
"By the way, I hope you understand about Sharon."
Sharon?
"You know, she just really felt like she needed to spend the night..."
"- in her own bed, you know?"
"- Sure, of course."
"Patty, you're the greatest friend."
- Go back to sleep.
- Okay.
Here.
"Now, you prefer your coffee at least two days old, right?"
I insist upon it.
You've been amazing through all this.
"No, I just don't think it has hit me yet."
"So Andy, was he working really hard or something?"
Give me 10 hours.
"If I'm not back, you cut it down and keep going."
Snow won't like that.
That's why I'm asking you.
"If I don't get back, you get her home."
HOOK:
"Ladies, in this world we are slaves to time, and ours is running out."
"In other words, tick-tock."
(ZIPS SLEEVE)
I was hoping it would be you.
Just get on with it.
Put your hand right here.
That's a good girl.
"This will allow you to climb, but there are other dangers."
Thankfully you've got me to protect you.
"I can't climb one-handed, can I?"
Don't think I'm taking my eyes off you for a second.
I would despair if you did.
Let's go.
- (BIRD CALLING) - (WIND WHISTLING)
(GRUNTS)
(PANTING)
First beanstalk?
"Well, you never forget your first."
"You know, most men would take your silence as off-putting, but I love a challenge."
I'm concentrating.
HOOK:
"No, you're afraid."
Afraid to talk.
"To reveal yourself, to trust me."
Things would be a lot smoother if you do.
You should be used to people not trusting you.
I wouldn't doubt it.
You're just like your father about sex.
Just like him!
Don't say things about my father.
He was wonderful.
- Wonderful!
- And good to you.
"- You told me that, so don't blame him."
- Wonderful and good.
That's what I told you?
"Well, I lied."
I lied because I was ashamed of him and of myself.
- Then why did you marry him?
- I didn't!
He didn't marry me because he had a wife.
"- You don't mean that, Mother."
- I do mean it.
- Don't you understand?
- No.
He had a wife!
No!
Nellie!
Allison.
"Connie, everybody reacts differently to suicide."
"With Allison, severe shock."
"She looks so, so... ."
Shock is just a kind of a sleep.
It's an escape when the mind can't accept what it sees.
"A few days' care, and she'll be out of it."
I guess I'd better tell Selena.
"And Connie just because it happened in your house, don't think any of it was your fault."
Somehow I do.
I don't know. I'm feeling a little bit weird.
You know everything's going to be okay.
I feel it.
"So, you pick out a dress yet ?"
Dress ?
"Yeah, you know, girls wear those sometimes."
Stepps.
Main Squeeze Night.
Couples only Saturday night.
"We already talked about this, remember ?"
Yeah.
"We talked about it, but I didn't know we decided on it."
"Well, it's Stepps."
What is there to decide on it ?
I don't know. I just thought that with the flight and everything... that maybe we should cool it for a little while.
What ?
"Well, uh, what are you saying ?"
Are you saying that you don't wanna be with me ?
You don't wanna be seen with me ?
What are you saying ?
"I'm just saying I'm confused, that's all."
Confused about what ?
Me ?
A little bit.
I don't know.
Yeah... no... maybe.
Maybe ?
"So, hold on."
What ?
"Are we talking about Stepps and school, or are you talking about the grocery store, the sidewalk and museums ?"
"Break it down a little bit better for me, 'cause I don't get it."
When is it okay for us to be together ?
- It comes with a free cigarette.
"- Oh, no."
That doesn't matter.
We don't need it.
"Well, if you don't want it, I'll take it."
"No, no, no."
Don't do that... smoking is bad.
You should quit smoking right now.
Hey...
Ahh.
We seem to be in the clear.
- Are you hurt?
- Yeah.
I got caught on top of the fence.
Check out my calf...
it's like Scratch City.
How about you?
"I'm fine, except I was impaled on a metal pipe."
"Oh, my God!"
"Oh, my God!"
It's gonna be fine.
"Oh, my God!"
"I got rifles, vests, flash grenades..."
"Chips, dips, ice cream sammies..."
"I'm pretty sure there's gonna be snacks in Florida, Scully."
Pretty sure?
Do you arrest someone if you're pretty sure they're guilty?
"No, Amy, you wait till you get all the facts!"
"Hey, okay, everyone, let's just try to bring things we actually need for the mission."
Really?
Then what is this?
"Oh, it's a book of 4,000 essential photos of Nikolaj for me to show Jake."
"Jove's sake, he's like a tree!"
Hence why he moved me up here.
What?
You can't change the rules just cos you found a tree man.
You have to check with me first.
"No, it's my sport."
I invented it.
I've been playing it for ages!
It's my sport.
Is this still the meeting?
"No, ignore that."
"Basically, my point was..."
"Hello, I'm Marcus."
I'm gonna do some really good stuff around here for you.
So...
Like what?
"Like, well... give you comfier chairs and unblock the toilets... and oil that squeaky door."
"Oh, thank you."
"Yes, exactly."
"For too long, this company has put profits above people."
Yeah.
"If there's anything you need at any point, just ask and I will deliver."
Thank you very much.
"Could I go and find a big man for my jugball side, please?"
Yeah.
"Not exactly what I had in mind, but OK, fine."
"Wicked, thanks."
It's terrible!
I can't eat anything.
"You don't know any dentists, do you?"
"Davus here could extract the bad tooth, if you want."
"What, really?"
"It was awful and it was terrible and it was really, really scary."
What?
No!
Go back.
"Although the Charming was fast,"
I was swift enough to repel the attack and leap to safety.
Which is exactly what he wanted you to do.
"Charming laughed, just like a crazed maniac."
"No, I'm sorry, but I would never let that happen to me."
"Instead, I..."
I woke up.
"Yeah, that's right."
It was all a dream.
You mean a nightmare.
"You know you're on the ceiling, right?"
I will get you for this.
Oh!
And then the lights went out.
It was horrible and sad how Puss pleaded for mercy.
Mercy?
Please.
"Said Puss, with his last dying breath."
"But when the lights came back on, it was the donkey who was taking a shower."
"Oh, my goodness."
Why would I do that?
"And right behind you, there was danger."
"- Oh, man."
- You were paralyzed.
It was a donkey-eating waffle.
It was packing heat and it wanted revenge!
I want revenge!
The donkey... ran.
We are moving.
What do you mean?
The factory is cutting back.
There is no work for Rolf.
He got offered a position as a mechanic in Notodden.
And I got a job at the bag factory there.
What does Lise say to this?
Does she want to go?
- We need money.
"- Yes of course, I'm sorry."
We leave this Friday.
- Friday?
What about the concert?
"- No, it..."
We were supposed to go together.
"I'm going to see if we can postpone it, so that Lise can go to the concert."
That would be nice.
"Sorry, I'm just being stupid."
Thanks.
It was a bit early!
Did you check about Friday?
Do you know anyone who can postpone the shipment?
- Yes.
"Do it by tomorrow, then we'll postpone until Sunday."
"- Excuse me, Sir."
- Tronstad.
- Have you got a minute?
"- Yes, what can I do for you?"
How sure are we?
How far down the line are they with the bomb?
Any new information I haven't got?
"Well, we're never sure."
"Paul, can I borrow you?"
I need you to check something for me.
"Do you know how many wives and girlfriends we've had sat across from us, insisting they were completely in the dark?"
You're in this up to your neck.
"We're watching all the ports, so they have nowhere to go."
I don't know where they are.
"That's bollocks, and you know it."
"- Sarge, can I...?"
"- Tennison, we've got this."
No.
Go on.
"If you want to help David, you need to tell us where he is."
Did David tell you about Julie-Ann?
She was 17.
"Someone strangled her and dumped her with the rubbish, like she didn't matter."
Where was he on the evening of Sunday 13th May?
- I don't know.
- It was raining that night.
"Did he come home, soaked to the skin?"
He was home!
How's he been acting since?
You're his mum.
Mums always know when something's not right.
I found... a photo of them both.
Him and Julie-Ann.
"She mattered to David, didn't she?"
Did he tell you about her?
Did you know she was pregnant?
- Was the child David's?
- God...
God.
Where can we find him?
The internal bleeding dance!
- I could sure use some help too.
"- You got it, partner!"
- Move!
I want the fat one!
"- They're all fat, Biatch!"
"Say mister, you got any other leads on where I can get some more bullets?"
"The other place got into a crime scene, long story."
"Just do some thinkin' on it, okay?"
Are you expectin' anybody else?
Are you sure?
It might be back up for Donnie's crew.
"Maybe they're supposed to call in, you know, like we do."
Why didn't they just come right in like everybody else has?
"I don't know, who the hell he is, I'm out of bullets again."
I'll get it.
What?
Wait but...
what if Donnie's other guys?
- I know what they'll do.
- I thought you wanted us to kill you.
You jealous?
- Kinda.
- Now take the fire escape.
I'll stall.
Otherwise they're gonna kill us all today after see what happened in here.
Go!
- You should come too!
"- No, no, I shouldn't."
This way I buy you some time.
Go!
Please.
Talking menschkeit.
Stuff between men.
"The """"there"""" that's there."
The thousand telephone calls.
The bouquets and the brickbats.
The space between a handshake.
You know.
Stuff that goes with you to your grave.
There's space between a handshake for right and wrong?
Why are you pressing me?
I'm looking for an answer.
You want an answer?
"Okay, Pappy."
Think of it as colors.
There's black and there's white.
And in between is mostly gray.
That's us.
Gray's tough because it's not as simple as black and white.
"And for the media, certainly not as interesting."
But it's who we are.
What are you gonna do now?
"You mean """"we. """""
We'll fight the sons of bitches.
We're gonna come out swinging.
"We're gonna tell them, """"Hey!"
We're only human.
Everybody makes mistakes.
Frank Anselmo is dead.
He was a friend...
"... butthelast of the clubhouse bosses is gone. """""
We're gonna clean up the Augean stables.
We'll go to Miami...
I'm in the middle of it.
We'll take care of it.
We'll manage.
We'll get it done.
Don't worry about it.
Yeah.
Fine.
Bye.
I do like my drink.
It goes hand in hand with playing.
It's a given.
A morning break drink.
"Before that, three spritzers just so I can talk."
"Then, with the morning break drink, 10 spritzers."
"And afterwards a few shots, because everything's gone so well."
But I'm predisposed because my whole family drinks.
Is dinner ready?
This is our basement den.
We don't use it as often as before.
- We used to celebrate birthdays here.
- We don't celebrate here anymore.
"My son was a musician, he'd play for us."
"On birthdays, Christmas, New Year's."
We always had such a good time.
We had Mardi Gras parties.
"We had Mardi Gras parties, but... that's all over."
"Yup, pretty much."
"The carpets here, actually..."
I'm no fan...
"I'm no fan of carpets, but my wife..."
"It doesn't fit upstairs, but it cost a lot, so I put it down here."
- Nowadays...
"In all of them, you attack him first."
But I had to!
He's a psychopath!
"- I killed him, and..."
- Go on.
"I mean, not him, but it's hard to explain."
That man is going to attack me again!
"I don't mean to offend you or make you uncomfortable, but, oh,"
- do you know what a nigga moment is?
- Of course.
"Thank God for them, or I wouldn't have a job."
"But an n-word moment, as you put it, does not excuse you from obeying the law."
"So if this is an n-word moment, Mr. Freeman, my advice is, do not be an n-word."
"Oh, hi, guys."
What are you doing up?
"I, uh, got into a little fender bender."
"I'm okay... just a little, uh..."
"Granddad, you got your ass beat again!"
"I mean, anybody can lose once or twice, but granddad stay losing!"
What?
!
You know what happened?
!
Do we know what happened?
!
Everybody knows what happened!
I caught the last half of it on the live stream!
"Oh, no!"
Why me?
!
Why?
!
"Well, I had a great day."
"I haven't learned a thing about comedy, and August and I had a huge fight."
"Oh well, how would you like a nice doughnut?"
"from this bag labeled ""donuts""."
Ahh!
You touched doggy doody!
Since when is doggy doody made in Taiwan?
They have dogs in Taiwan.. big ones.
"Funny, right?"
- I don't know.
"You know,"
I don't think I'm ever gonna see my coat again.
"Okay, Harry, why don't you sit down, you'll feel a lot better?"
Right here.
Excuse me.
Damn!
"You know, at least I can take comfort in knowing that I treated my coat well."
Such as yesterday.
It was hot on the bus.
I took it off and folded it neatly and placed it under the shade of my seat.
What?
You left it on the bus.
No-o-o!
You know they have a lost and found Harry.
Oh you mean I might see my coat again?
Oh I am so happy.
"Dick, I've been thinking about this ""humour"" thing."
Why don't you try what those guys on TV do?
Everybody says they're funny?
"- Oh, yeah, those guys!"
You know..
The McLaughlin group?
"Yes, dear?"
It's Mrs. Richards.
A fatal accident?
She's had some money stolen.
"Oh, Mr. Fawlty,"
I tell Polly.
"That's all right, but don't tell anyone else, not even me!"
You know nothing!
- Basil?
"- Yes, dear?"
You've got to help me handle this.
She's in a frightful state.
I can't get a word in edgewise.
She's had £85 taken from her room.
"I said we'll search everyone, but she insists we send for the police."
What do we do with someone like that?
She just keeps on!
"Mrs. Richards, how very nice to see you!"
Are you enjoying your stay?
There's no need to shout.
I have my hearing aid on.
"Mrs. Richards, I've explained to my husband..."
I've just been up to my room.
"£85 has been taken from my bag, which I had hidden under the mattress."
"Oh, yes?"
It's a disgrace!
I haven't been here a day.
- What sort of staff do you employ?
- Mrs. Richards...
"If you knew anything at all about running a hotel, this sort of thing wouldn't happen!"
"Well, what have you got to say for yourself?"
What?
"I'm sure you are, Jake."
"You ask me to take point, and then you kind of undercut my authority in there."
"Yeah, I'm sorry about that."
We could've closed it clean for 1.75.
I know.
So now we just sit it out?
"Liz has cancer, Jake."
What?
Found out last night.
Is it serious?
Mm-hmm.
"Burton, I'm so sorry."
"You know, you should have told me about this before the meeting."
"I--I am trying to get vortex as our client, and I--I really don't want to do a deal with them that can turn out badly."
[Door opens]
[Door closes]
The U.S. attorney wants names from kalaya.
What does kalaya get?
Protection from the thai penal system.
Come on.
She'll be dead in the streets.
Yeah.
That's why I didn't take the deal.
I lined up a couple of prospective foster parents.
Do you think we have any kind of a shot in here today?
"Probably not, Ms. Agnes."
Hmm.
Liz:
How did it go today?
"Well, they want you to get life insurance."
Heh!
I can't do it.
Definitely not.
Day after tomorrow is your engagement.
Go.
Get ready.
What are you talking?
Do you know how badly you cheated me?
The lies you told me.
Cheating?
Lying?
For this simple matter.
Is this a simple matter.
If you know what really happened...
What happened?
I said that I joined the job for you.
I didn't like it.
"So, I quit the job."
You got the information from some idiot.
You got hurt.
Is that all?
Not only that.
Didn't you call my love silly?
"If you keep shouting at me, anyone would say that."
You were no less.
I was after you to make you say I love you.
You said that at the time of our separation.
How would I feel?
Frustrated.
What are you staring at me?
You were trying to make me remember something.
You wanted to say something.
C'mon talk.
You said you don't remember your past.
"Well, why..."
- Why don't we think about it?
"- Okay, I will."
I just did.
I want to do it!
"I'm so sorry, but I could really use the money,"
- and I think it could be fun.
- There you go.
A star is born!
D-d-don't worry.
It's not gonna change a thing.
"My job with you always comes first, I promise."
"Come on, we've got a million things to do."
We gotta talk to the publicity people and set up a photo shoot.
I hope your afternoon is free...
Natalie.
I hate that picture!
I like the other one better.
The one on the trolley cars.
What do you think?
I don't know.
"My god, it's so weird seeing myself on a bus like that."
"I mean, I can't believe it's really me up there."
I can't believe this is really happening.
I can't believe it either.
"I hate to bring this up, but we have work to do."
"Remember, your predecessor, Marissa Kessler."
Murder victim.
Multiple stab wounds.
Does that ring a bell?
"Sorry, sorry."
"All right, Randy and the Captain are probably already there."
He used to make me and brother fight in the backyard every day.
He would come home and drink a beer and watch us beat the shit out of each other.
And one day we just decided--
Why fight each other?
Why fight for free?
So we just left.
What else is going on in that head of yours?
I don't know.
I just can't help thinking that I should have been there for him.
I should have been there for Frankie.
What could you have done?
just been there.
I wake up Why the hell didn't I go with him?
I should have fucking went with him.
And then maybe that would have been you too.
Yeah.
But it haunts me.
I hear him calling my name just like when we were kids.
And I'm not there.
I loved my brother Frankie. especially around the old man.
Have you forgiven him?
I just--
I'm not afraid of him anymore.
So what are you gonna do?
Are you gonna stay here?
Would you stay here for me?
what's up?
I understand.
Saturday?
Okay.
yeah.
all right.
What if they come in?
I don't see why I can't piss here.
Because I do not want to see piss coming out the end of your cock.
- I could sit down and do it.
- What?
I do that sometimes.
"You know, for a treat."
"Oh, fuck, just get on with it then."
- Are you going yet?
"- I can't, you're putting me off."
"- Shit, who's that?"
- Northwood?
- Who is it?
- It's obviously me.
What is happening in here?
- Has Charlotte sorted it?
- No.
I've sorted it though.
- What have you done?
- My mum's gonna pick us up.
What?
"- Oh, this is tragic."
- Called your mom!
Your mum is coming to rescue us from the toilet of an under-18 disco because we're being bullied by 12-year-olds?
No-one must ever know about this.
"Si, go outside and take your beating from this child, and then we can leave."
I'd have taken him down if it weren't for Northwood.
How were you going to take him down?
Spunk in his eyes?
"Oh, shit."
What if Carli finds out about me and that girl?
"Oh, no!"
Attack!
Good dog...
"Oh, it likes eating buns!"
Shit!
"Oh, the thief is crying for catching thief!"
It's Fong who touched Miss Shiu's ass!
"Now, the truth is found!"
He can't imagine that the dog which is trained by him... will betray him because of my righteousness and its conscience!
It turns to charge against its master!
What a righteous dog!
Let's clap for it.
Lysee is a good dog.
Lysee is a good dog!
We've found a good dog named Lysee in China.
"Miss, do you want to talk to me?"
I'm sorry to make a mistake.
"I am so ignorant that,"
I was almost cheated by that bastard.
"By the way, you owe me something, huh?"
I wish to have chance to pay for it.
This is my student Foon.
Brother Foon.
He likes you so much.
"Master, you are disgusting!"
But you need not fall for him.
"Well, 3 pm tomorrow, come to my home on time."
Let's discuss what you'd pay for it.
What do you think?
I'll be there on time.
Let's go!
Let's go!
"Master, we've found it."
You can't smoke here.
Did she talk to you that day?
Yes.
"Or rather, I talked."
About what?
My own business.
Did she mention me?
"To be honest, Lydia hadn't mentioned you in a long time."
This is all my fault.
No.
It was my fault.
This song gave me goose bumps.
"Marco, I've always wanted to ask you."
"Why did you cry the night I met you, after you killed the snake?"
It brought back a lot of memories.
What memories?
"Years ago, I had to kill another snake."
We were in Africa.
She had the same phobia as you.
"She was waiting outside the tent, terrified,"
"defenseless, and totally naked."
She saw the snake while we were sleeping.
Was she the one for whom you slept on the couch?
I hate that woman.
- I haven't seen her in years.
- Even worse.
What can I do to make you forget her?
Exactly what you're doing.
You were fast asleep so we didn't wake you.
Is Dr.Vega here?
He'll be in his office.
I saw him arrive.
- Must you go?
"Well, yes."
I've got an 8:00 appointment at the office in the morning.
"Good night, Lynn."
Don't bother to see me out.
"- Good night, Dougie."
- Good night.
"I've been around long enough to know that you want something, honey."
What?
I want you to kill someone for me.
My husband.
Please.
I know who you are.
I've read all about you.
You don't know enough not to believe everything you read.
It would be so easy for you.
I could help you.
I'll pay you anything.
I'll be worth a fortune afterwards.
You're out of your mind.
You're lucky I don't slap you senseless for even suggesting it.
"Please, you've met him."
You see what he's like.
You can't imagine what it's like living with a man like that.
I want him dead.
You've got to help me.
I don't have to do anything.
"Got the wrong guy, honey."
You better forget the whole thing and just hope that I do too.
Got the Cleveland newspaper.
Does it say anything?
"Yeah, in a small item in the second section."
"Bye, dad."
"Hey, I already know where I'm going to hang this."
Dad?
Yeah.
"What, Sarah?"
What is it?
I don't think I wanna go.
"Hey, what is this?"
What're you trying to do here?
I just came to say hello.
No need to get testy.
You and I both know I cannot change Sarah's path.
I can't influence her to make a different decision.
"I can't this, I can't that."
"It's all about you, isn't it?"
What?
Wonder why that is.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
"Where's Sarah in this equation, Tom?"
You're not making the choice.
She is.
"Come on, that is pure semantics, and you know it."
The only reason that she's changing her mind is because I'm a different person.
"So, you know what?"
"Actually, yes, it has everything to do with me."
"Hey, dad, what's going on?"
Nothing.
"Oh, I was just describing to the officer about my wallet, my lost wallet."
"So, thank you, officer."
"Well, we'll be sure to put every resource we have on this, just for you."
Let's go.
Marjorie?
Unbelievable.
That was one of the things that he had:
enormous trust in young people.
Lou put me in charge and gave me his checkbook.
"And he said, you know, ""You distribute the fees."""
And I grew a beard because I wanted to look older.
I'm serious.
How old were you when Lou died?
- I was 11.
- That's what I thought.
"- I was 11, yeah."
- Did you know him well?
- I have a sense for him.
- Right.
"And I saw him, you know, once a week, maybe."
"- That's all, though?"
"- That's about all, yeah."
"- Did you ever travel with him, or..."
"- No, no."
"That's why I wanted to talk to you, because you spent a lot of time with him."
"- Oh, yeah, me and my family did."
- Your family did too?
"He used to spend Christmas with us, yeah."
- He spent Christmas with you?
"- He loved Christmas, yeah."
He absolutely loved it.
"I can remember him lying on our bed watching cartoons with the kids... and then falling asleep, you know?"
"They'd just say,"
"""Lou's sound asleep, Daddy."""
"That's when we'll leave... ""You know, leave him be."
"He's tired."""
"Lou was very willful, you see?"
"Oh, God, can't you help her?"
Just help her!
It wants no straps.
"Hello, Regan."
I'm a friend of your mother's.
I'd like to help you.
"You might loosen these straps, then."
"I'm afraid you might hurt yourself, Regan."
I'm not Regan.
I see.
"Well, then, let's introduce ourselves."
I'm Damien Karras.
And I'm the devil.
"Now, kindly undo these straps."
"If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?"
"That's much too vulgar a display of power, Karras."
Where's Regan?
"In here, with us."
Show me Regan and I'll loosen one of the straps.
"Could you help an old altar boy, Father?"
"Your mother's in here with us, Karras."
Would you like to leave a message?
I'll see that she gets it.
If that's true then you must know my mother's maiden name.
What is it?
What is it?
Thank you.
"Look, I'm only against the possibility of doing your daughter more harm than good."
Nothing you could do could make it any worse.
I can't do it.
I need evidence that the Church would accept...
-...as signs of possession.
All right.
Do your ears.
One at a time.
"Okay, bend your heads over, shake them out with your fingers."
Put your hands above your head.
Hands out in front of you.
Over.
Move those fingers.
Reach down and lift up your nut sack.
"Drop your nut sacks, and skin back your dick."
Turn around.
"One foot at a time, pick it up and wiggle the toes."
Other foot.
"Bend over, grab your ass, spread your cheeks and give me two good coughs."
(MEN COUGHING)
Stand right there.
julie:
You're like two people.
Inmate Montoya Santana?
One is like a kid.
Doesn't know how to dance.
Step this way.
Doesn't know how to make love.
That's the one I cared about.
Step inside.
But the other one...
The other one I hate.
"Τhe one who knows, the one who has his rap down, who knows how to run drugs."
Who kills people!
SANΤANA:
"Until now, I would've thought it a sign of weakness to even listen to what you said to me that night."
But I see that you were right.
Ha!
That's all from mini-golf right there.
No lessons.
Can you believe it?
"I don't know what you think you're doing here, but..."
I was just starting to count the number of your fingers
I'm gonna break.
Get it?
You know what?
"I'm not too good at math, so I might lose count here."
Wait.
Ah!
He paid me.
A lot of money.
- For what?
"- To make up test results, phony prescriptions, medical bills."
- Why?
- I don't know.
You know who your father is.
I didn't ask questions.
I did it as I was told to do.
He came to me with a lot of cash.
"He said he needed a terminal illness, so I gave him one."
Ah!
"Jesus, Victor."
We need to get something straight about this partnership.
I'm in charge here.
- You work for me.
- Okay.
"Every decision about this party has been made for a reason, so before you go unwinding my hard work,"
- you might want to get...
- What the hell are you
"All tourists, all registered with that stupid odd jobs app."
"Oh, yeah?"
Wow.
"God, that's crazy."
"Whatever they're doing to you, whatever they've done to you, it's dangerous, and we really have to go now, Cooper."
"Okay, okay."
Alright.
"- Well, if your story's true..."
- Cooper.
- Then how'd you find me?
- What?
How'd you know where I am?
"It's a games company, I looked up the address."
"Yeah, really?"
"No, no, no, no."
How'd you find me here?
This place.
- I tracked you.
- You tracked me?
"Yeah, with your GPS on your phone."
Find My Friends.
Find My Friends?
"That would've worked, but they took my phone."
"And it's in a building, like, a mile away."
"So, yeah, nice try."
That's right.
So much for women outsmarting men.
Singularity that!
"Look, all I'm saying is that"
"I think that you could've come up with a better story, it could have been funny or..."
"Okay, alright, don't be pissed."
Do you ever wonder how your bank account got hacked?
Got the Cleveland newspaper.
Does it say anything?
"Yeah, in a small item in the second section."
It says the local DA is missing.
Good.
Get in touch with Lister this afternoon.
Tell him he did okay and he'll be paid in the usual way.
Okay.
What do you want?
- We're in trouble.
- What do you mean we're in trouble?
"Last night, Stan pretended to be drunker than he really was."
"After Douglas left, he sneaked down the back stairway."
- So what?
- Don't you understand?
He saw us.
He even took pictures.
He's a creep.
He's gonna use those pictures to divorce me.
- You let him.
- I won't get a cent from him.
- That's your problem.
- No.
"No, it's your problem too."
He's gonna smear us across every front page in this country.
I don't want that and you don't want that either.
I've had worse publicity than this and survived it.
Go home.
- Figured you'd run here and warn him.
- Wait a minute.
I've already waited long enough.
"I thought about you all night, Gordon."
"Well, the hit I can take."
"It's the not swinging back, that's what bothers me."
"Standing up for the truth the way you did,"
It's what I've been telling the American people
I'm gonna do for them.
That's why I'm in this.
"John, I don't know what to say."
Stop trying to argue yourself out of a job.
What's up?
"Royo, it's me,"
Aisha.
It's about the deal.
"Isaac ain't gonna bitch out, is he?"
You said this was happening.
He's still in.
"But listen up,"
"I know you ain't down with the split, never have been."
- Maybe I can do better.
- You?
Money ain't coming in like it was.
"That's why I reached out to you in the first place, put this deal together."
"If Isaac doesn't make it back from this meeting, wouldn't be a lot of tears."
You still there?
I'm here.
"Well, I'm still listening."
Good.
"Okay, he's got it."
"Oh, no."
- What?
- Locke signed in downstairs.
He was just bumped up to head of field ops.
He has a debrief scheduled with Mullins.
So if that bug hitched a ride on Aldo's body...
We need to call Booth.
"Uh, Brennan said Booth's busy."
"What, too busy to hear about this?"
"Trust me, it's important."
(crickets chirping)
Sergeant.
It's been a while.
"Yeah, too long."
I wish it was for a different occasion.
"Yeah, me, too."
"Who killed him, Seeley?"
"I don't know, Dave, but I'm gonna find out."
Need my help?
"No, I'm good."
"But either of you two, uh, ever hear from Aldo before he, uh, went missing?"
Not me.
He wasn't easy to find.
"All right, well, if you hear anything, just let me know."
"It's my job now to take care of things, okay?"
"Sure, Booth, we'll sit and wait for that to happen."
"You know what, Ted, I'm not here to get into this with you right now."
This is about Aldo.
Guess that's what it takes-- one of us dying before he comes around here.
"Oh, come on, Ted, you know he had nothing to do with Father Clemens' murder."
Yeah.
What did Booth do to help him stay alive?
Not enough.
We all could have been more in touch with him.
DAVE:
He's the reason that we're all home.
"At least for me, I'm grateful."
I won't have my decisions questioned.
Go below until I give you permission to come on deck.
Clear?
"Yes, sir."
Quite clear.
Mr. D'Arblay set the gallants.
"- Aye, aye, sir."
Set the gallants!
A beating every day for a week.
- Why won't the captain do something?
- What can he do?
- You all right?
- Thank you.
"Come on, then."
We'll go down together.
Easy now.
Muster on the gun deck.
Move!
- These stripes are healing nicely.
"- They're still bloody painful, sir."
"His own son, eh?"
Can't the captain see what's going on?
"Hey, you, come here."
Sit down.
You said captain can't do anything.
What did that mean?
- I was guessing...
- What's it mean?
"If he went for Scott-Padget over this, there'd be a court-martial."
They'd prove he attacked an officer to protect his son.
That'd finish him.
"If Scott-Padget has influence, it'd be easily done."
Like this one here.
I can strap it on my upper thigh and fuck my love slave from behind.
I also really enjoy using the humbler.
Here's the slaves bum.
his upper thighs fit here.
It's worn in a kneeling position.
The scrotum goes in here.
You clamp it in.
and he's unable to stand up.
"He has to follow me on all fours and it pulls back hard on the scrotum, of course."
It's very unpleasant for him.
And I of course enjoy it.
Naturally.
A toast!
A toast!
Let's drink to our well-being!
A meter forward
A meter backward
A meter downward
A meter upward
And bottoms up
Prost.
Prost.
So you think life's shitty?
- It is.
- Just find some place nice.
I like the way things used to be.
What do you mean?
Down here you sense every little thing.
You can really taste the grapes.
It seems to me.
I think so too.
Where are you going?
We have some business in town.
We'll be back as soon as we can.
- I trust that you'll keep an eye on things?
- So I'm the babysitter now.
"Frederick, if this is going to work we have to cooperate with one another."
- So you say.
"- I'll watch things, Miss Pearl."
"Thank you, Harper."
"I'm thinking nothing huge, dinner at the Grill, maybe a late movie..."
A double date?
"Two pair, out on a Friday night, coupled."
"Yeah, a double date."
- You think that's a good idea?
- Why not?
"You know, we all haven't gone out before and I don't want it to be uncomfortable for us."
"The couple dynamics have changed and there's been a little awkwardness between you, Matt and me and I just think it's important that we get over it."
I don't know.
"You know what, I think that sounds like a great idea."
- You do?
"- Yeah, yeah."
A nice evening out with friends.
"Sounds fun, as in fun."
Hm?
- A double date it is.
- Okay.
Heh.
So we will see you tonight.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Okay.
"Ha, ha."
The band is too loud.
"Ten minutes, Yuri."
Ten minutes.
All I asked was that you hold Mikhail... for ten minutes.
Is that a long time?
No.
That is a very short time.
How long can you hold your breath?
"I know a fellow in Odessa once who could hold his breath... for five minutes, 33 seconds."
Did Mikhail talk to anyone while he was here?
"Nicholas, please."
The man is trying to speak.
He was talking... to her.
"So, what did you and Mikhail talk about?"
I told him he had a phone call.
The caviar is fresh tonight.
Did I tell you what a pretty girl you are?
"Let me ask you something, sweetheart."
Do you have any idea what will happen to you if you lie to me?
I will never lie to you.
"Because if you lie to me, pretty girl... you won't be pretty anymore."
Get back to work.
All she needs is a good f-
What are you doing over there?
"Oh, Mikhail, I missed you."
You're so tense.
I'll help loosen you up.
What's this?
You playing hard to get?
Is this a game?
Fine.
Have it your way.
I want... that one.
"Jack Donaghy to the control room, please."
Jack Donaghy.
Peanut's not an actor.
I just rescued her from a lab.
"Hey, Lemon, I'll drop you off."
Where do you live?
The studio.
I want you to drop me at the studio.
I want to tell Donaghy to his face that I quit in front of the whole crew so that they know he didn't fire me.
I want to see that.
"Oh, oh, pull over!"
Pull over here!
"Tracy, I don't have time for this."
Right here.
This is where I grew up.
This is the Jordan family estate?
Wasn't no Jordan family nothing.
This is where I was in foster care.
"Oh, sorry."
Me and two other dudes and a girl with messed-up fingers.
I'm so lucky I got out of here.
It's not luck.
"I mean, you got out of here because you're very talented and people love you and..."
Are you peeing?
Where's Donaghy?
I want to talk to him right now.
"Last time I saw him, he was riding the crane camera."
"Oh, I have Pete for you."
"Pete, oh, my God, I didn't know."
"No, listen, it will give me a chance to spend more time with my kids."
I'm quitting.
ELl JOE:
You're thinking it's cowardly.
I think it's smart.
"See, I know all about your six amigos."
You all been making quite a name for yourselves around here.
"Real proud of yourself, ain't you?"
ELl JOE:
"Yeah, I suppose."
But it had to be done.
"See, I haven't been sleeping too well ever since I pinned that murder on you."
Your conscience bothering you?
[chuckling ] I ain't got a conscience.
How about Jess Kincaid?
You killed an innocent farmer just to frame me for murder.
"Got you off my trail, didn't it?"
This little voice inside keeps telling me...
... VinTanner'sgonnacome looking for me.
Settle out both scores.
So I figured I'd find you first.
I'm glad I did.
Let's do this.
Gotta get back on the trail.
MAN:
Take cover.
YATES:
Don't let him get away.
Get him.
What took you so long?
I thought you might need this.
Yah!
"Now, now."
No need to rush in all at once.
"When mom gives orders, you have to obey..."
"You are still in college, are they sick or what?"
Bankruptcy!
He's broke.
They can't afford to support both of us.
I fucked up your life as well.
Never mind.
I'll pay for that too.
You take care of yourself.
"Murat, I need your help."
I am pregnant...
I want this child but not marriage.
If we get to the point...
Sis?
"Yeah, we are all fine."
Can?
"No, that's not what I meant."
I was going to go to the army recruiting centre... a German photographer was studying my art.
Are you a faggot?
Did you apply for an exemption?
Would you like coffee?
I want to take you to Germany.
What would I do there?
You'll stay with me.
My house big.
I'll do everything for you.
The military won't let go of me.
What kind of photos do they want?
Holy shit.
Disgusting.
They must really enjoy this.
"Sukran, could you make tea for us?"
You were the voice in my head this whole time?
That's right.
I'm the one who was putting all those thoughts in your noggin.
"I'm your conscience, and as long as you let me,"
I'll always be in...
The End.
That wasn't me!
I never had any bugs in my head.
Ha ha.
Ask anyone!
"Okay, then."
Why don't we start by asking...
your conscience!
Aah!
"Uh, now who's cheatin'?"
"Well, Donkey, looks like it's just you and me."
Go ahead.
There ain't nothing you can say that can scare me.
"Yeah, well, I suppose there's nothing left to do but sit here in the dark and wait for the ghost."
Ghost?
What ghost?
"Farquaad's ghost, of course."
"As a matter of fact, if I remember correctly,"
I believe you had a hand in his untimely demise.
"Hey, man, that was an accident."
"And besides, all that ghost stuff is just an urban legend."
- You know that!
- Is it?
"Okay, okay."
That's... that's just the wind.
Donkey!
"And apparently, it knows my name!"
That won't happen.
"Then if I do win, you'll have to do me a favor."
"And if I lose, just let Jung Yeon go quietly."
- Sure.
- Hey.
"Whether he wins or loses, he still gets the benefit."
"Hey, it doesn't matter."
I'll just end it quickly.
It works like this.
"The one who attacks first, is at a loss."
The rule is simple.
"If he strikes, all you have to do is dodge."
"And since you're fast, you can dodge him until the end."
"Here, try to hit me."
Okay...
I'll be okay.
"For real, this time."
One more time.
After you continue to dodge like this...
Counter punch.
The opponent may attack first...
But you can turn the tables on him instantly.
You need to get your ass beat.
"Yes, Officer Han?"
I'll call you once we're making good progress.
You can go to Yong Moon Plan when I do.
Okay.
Delivery.
I'm okay.
"The opponent attacked first, but you can turn the tables on him instantly."
[Important Issue
- Controversial Issue.
This young man has departed from our midst.
"The Lord gave, the Lord bath taken away."
Let us pray.
Come in.
"Just put the coffee on the table, please."
-You're Sarah Beth;
-Yes.
Your--
-Please sit.
-There's no need for that.
I have something to say and then I'm going.
-How did you know I was here;
-l have a room at the hotel.
The clerk told me.
I'm not gonna let you hurt Pop anymore.
He can't stand any more.
"Maybe you couldn't hurt him, even if you tried."
"Maybe there's not anything that can hurt him, not after Brock."
I hope so because nobody can stand any more.
Even him.
So maybe the pain's over now.
Unless you've brought him more.
Have you;
What do you want of him;
Nothing.
I came to help Brock.
I didn't know he-- l didn't know until the train was almost here.
"I'm not even going to see your father, Sarah Beth."
"I might try if I thought I could make up a little to him and to you for all the years, but I know I couldn't."
He tried to tell me how he felt.
How the grass was somehow godly to him.
He tried to tell me and I didn't hear.
They're making your mind into mush!
- You hear me?
- I'll take them back.
I knew my Pittsburgh guys always wanted guns.
Since I would see them in the afternoon to pick up a delivery
I was pretty sure I'd get my money back.
"Oh, my God."
"When I finally got to the hospital, Michael's doctor wanted to put me in bed."
"Jesus Christ, what happened to you?"
I almost got into an accident on the way here.
And I told him I was partying all night.
- I'm fine.
- Come on.
Get over here.
"- Doc, I'm fine."
- Let me check you out.
Come on.
"He took mercy on me, gave me 10 milligrams of Valium and sent me home."
My plan was to drop off my brother at the house and pick up Karen.
There it is.
You see that helicopter right there?
"Right in front of us, there."
I think it's been following me all morning.
- Get the fuck out.
"What are you, nuts?"
- I'm telling you.
I don't know what's going on.
It's the third time I've seen it.
At the hospital I saw it.
I had to make some stops.
I've seen it every time.
I've been all over town and I've seen it all day.
"Well, I guess you can't have cake today."
What if it's my leg?
"Claire, I guess I'm picking up the cake myself, because you didn't answer my messages."
Claire:
Grawr!
Gr-a-a-awr!
"Hey, Claire, are you having fun at the Gym Town?"
"As a matter of fact, I am."
"This is my new friend, Charlie."
"He loves dinosaurs, and tomorrow we're both gonna have pink eye."
"Hi, Charlie!"
Can you go and find the negligent adult that brought you here?
"Oh, do you have to go so soon?"
He smells so good!
"Yeah, you're like two sniffs away from a felony."
(sighs)
What is going on?
"I gave Phil such a hard time for being too emotional about Luke's graduation, but I think it's hitting me more than I want to admit."
I know.
It happens so fast.
Luke used to love coming here.
Today he gave us a Rolls-Royce.
The one outside is yours?
I thought I was gonna be able to meet Mr. Burt Reynolds!
You're lucky.
"When Manny goes, you still have Joe."
"Yeah, but it doesn't make it hurt any less."
We just have face it...
They're not boys anymore.
They're men.
"Luke has a job, and he's dating."
He can serve on a jury.
Shannon is on the trail of a creature known locally as The Beast.
She's brought us to the exact spot where we stand the best chance of seeing it tonight.
The full moon is about to rise and the creatures of the night are coming out to play.
And cut.
Nice.
Very poetic.
Don't let me get too fancy.
I don't want to lose the audience.
"So, how do you want to do this?"
Steve!
What is that?
A secure container.
Harmless but inescapable.
We're going to catch The Beast.
Our first time as a family.
I feel like I should make a speech.
You'd better make it quick if you don't want to end it growling.
Come on.
The moon won't wait.
Maddy?
I'm sorry.
- Maddy!
- Open this door.
Don't you dare!
Maddy!
Open this door now!
I'll see you in the morning.
"- Maddy, I mean it!"
- You are in trouble...
Are you sure about this?
No.
So hurry before I lose my nerve.
Stop it!
"Just stop it, for God's sake."
What's wrong with you?
"- What, what?"
- I get it.
Everybody's found their special someone
- except for this old coot.
"- No, Mags..."
"You guys can't get your hands off each other, and that's nasty."
And you guys can't get your hands on each other.
"Well, just get it over with and do it."
At least you're not all by yourself in your home alone.
"Well, that's it, Mags."
You got the movie.
- I got... got what?
- You just guessed the movie.
"""Home Alone,"" that was the movie."
- What?
"- Yeah, you won."
"Why didn't you guys just go ""ahh""?"
It's the poster.

"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, those apps still have some life in them."
- They're cream cheese.
- It doesn't keep.
"Mags, what is going on?"
Do you still have feelings for Bruce?
"No, of course not."
"Well, then are you in love with Cookie?"
'Cause I would understand that.
"I don't know, I'm just..."
"I'm standing there looking at you guys, and it just feels like everyone..."
"- Yes, she does."
"- Bite me, asshole."
You have a bad attitude when you're drinking.
"You have a bad attitude when you're drinking, you huge-footed slut."

"I'm just gonna go get more wasted, and then I'm gonna bang some rim, dude."
Really?
Could it be this guy?
"No, it can't, but it could be Dennis."

I'm gonna take this.
"I'm gonna take this, and I'll see you assholes later."
- That is my notebook.
- Free coffee for a year.
Wait a second.
Where did she get my note?
- You know what?
I have backups.
- What is with her?
Something about drinking.
She just won't stop talking about it.
"- What, the plates of shit?"
- Somebody pooped the bed.
Whatever.
Let's get out of here.
We could use a fresh set of eyes on this if you don't mind.
"No, thank you."
"I think that Artemis and I have much better things to do, thank you."
"Actually, I'm just gonna stick around."
Excuse me?
What did you say?
!
Our squadrons are all assembled...
Huh?
Then what squadrons are those?
Did His Majesty send reinforcements?
Sion said he was putting me in charge of this!
There's no way he'd do that!
- Then...
- Don't tell me...
It's him?
That's impossible!
Crimson Fingered Claugh would ignore hostages and attack?
What do we do?
"If we lose after taking people hostage, we'll be executed!"
"No, we haven't lost yet..."
Let's kill the hostages.
I get it.
Roland doesn't think we're serious!
If we kill a hostage...
- Cease this!
- But...
You've all done well.
But this is it.
Let us release the hostages.
"But, Princess..."
I shall do all I can.
With my life alone!
You must not!
I cannot allow the Princess to die alone...
"I, too..."
"I shall accompany you, Princess!"
"Don't you feel sorry for me, you fat, ugly pig."
You think I'm ugly?
"Look, I'm sorry about yesterday."
"I didn't mean it, okay?"
I'm not ugly.
You're ugly.
I'm not talking about it anymore.
I already told the cops and the doctors.
No one believes me.
They think I'm crazy.
"Well, I'm a little bit more open-minded than most."
"April, why did you tell the police you were possessed?"
It doesn't matter.
It matters to me.
When I --
"When I hurt Taylor, I was there, in my head, but I couldn't control my body."
"I could see what I was doing, but I couldn't stop."
I just wanted to stop.
I'm sorry.
You don't need to apologize.
"April, some of the kids at school told the police that you and Taylor didn't get along."
"Well, yeah, but I never wanted to kill her."
Never.
Do you believe me?
"Yeah, I do."
Just a couple more questions.
"On the day this happened, did you... happen to smell anything?"
Anything... like what?
Like rotten eggs or...
sulphur?
"Um, no."
Okay.
"I've had enough of the Cold War when we did... the ""Doctor Jivago"" shoot."
"You got the chicken, too?"
So good.
But I got the pieard.
I don't like playing with bones.
I'd bite my tongue on that one.
"You are so great, Richard."
I'm so glad you work at Skirt.
Some of the people there are so snobby.
The irony is they were all from trailer parks and they're all on the mate.
I was on the fashion closet and I heard Olivier and Resin talking...
- what is it with Paul?
- The duke?
What the hell is that?
Is he royalty or something?
Prince Chuck is his cousin or something.
"You'd never know, huh?"
Why do you think Resin is going out with him?
Do you think she'd be attracted to some guy in the art department?
But he's really cute... and funny... and smart...
Is it an arrow in your ass from Cupid Squivert?
- Yeah.
- But it's hopeless.
Why do you say that?
Things could work out.
- You never know a man's heart.
"- Yes, I do."
He already told me.
"He thinks of me as a ""great friend""."
The kiss of death!
But then on the other day he bought me fries.
He did?
- I shall call the police.
"- No, cos your part's over."
The end of your scene.
Back to the dole for you.
"Five lines, thank you and good night."
"Well, I must say, this looks very interesting."
"She's crying, you know."
"That, Eddie, is the biz."
It's a tough life.
"It's a tough life, dearie."
"I mean, look at Arthur Mullard."
She used to be quite attractive.
- I still quite fancy her.
"- Yeah, hur-uhh."
"Well, I must say."
This is very interesting.
Must learn to read sometime.
Right.
Sod all this health food.
"When I eat, I like to dice with a heart attack."
Let's have a good English roast and a coronary thrombosis.
- Right.
Let's make a shopping list.
- Yeah.
Four hundred pounds of oven chips.
"Right, that seems simple enough."
Better check the larder.
"Waste not, want not."
- Remember the poor children.
"- Oh, the little poor children."
Yes.
With their cosy little terrace dwellings.
- All right.
"Bye, Mom."
I left a wake up call for 9.
Do you want something to eat?
You mean this is one of those basement breakfast places?
I don't know how long we can keep doing this.
"Well, it won't be long."
- You'd go back to your foster parents?
- Not a chance.
But I've saved up enough to get out to Arizona.
I have a friend in Flagstaff.
You gonna miss me?
"It was nice knowing when something goes bump in the night, it's you."
What have you got to be afraid of?
Forgot this.
Honey?
Put on gloves if you're gonna do the dishes.
Right.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I can't do this anymore.
"Last night after I left, I felt awful."
I'm sorry for what I did and what almost happened.
I should have figured it out.
At least I should have listened to you.
"Yeah, well, it was terrible but all I could think about was my mom."
I'm sorry.
I was so mean.
"- Well, I had it coming."
- No.
I was thinking.
A could have given that ticket to mom but they made you do it to make it hurt more.
What if I don't want to let him go?
I will have abortion right away!
"Auntie, where is Yawang?"
"From now on, you are not allowed to leave this room!"
"When my son is awake, you will have to marry him!"
"Xiaotian,"
I think... you'd better go back to academy.
"She is my daughter,"
I know her well.
"Being with you, she will be in agony everyday!"
"Xiaotian, Auntie is begging you, don't contact her anymore!"
No!
- She needs me now!
- Just end it here!
Both of you don't have the same fate.
Listen to me!
"By this way, both of you can live on well."
I don't care about what has happened anymore!
She is my woman for all my life!
Please be careful.
Slow down!
Get in!
Stop!
Xiamu!
Come on.
- I can't.
- Don't talk!
Just follow me!
"If you don't stop, you will spend your life in the prison!"
"I'd kill all of you, and spend my life rotten in prison, it doesn't matter to me!"
"Xiamu, don't!"
"Xiamu, don't!"
"Through this bucket list, we want you to see that life is precious and beautiful--"
- I'll hook up with girls at the club...
- Excuse me..
And I'll have one night stands everyday.
"Stop, stop, stop."
We'll stop here!
Don't stop and let me continue.
"Do you think this broadcast is a joke, Sin Joon Young?"
It's not.
I'm being honest here.
What wouldn't I be able to do if I were to die soon?
What about drugs?
"Will you drink and drive, gamble, use public restrooms?"
"Do you want to date me, PD No Eul?"
Let's say I'll die in three months.
For only three months.
Really deeply.
Only... 3 months.
"Really passionately, with all of my strength."
"Well, since it was just a test..."
Those jokes don't really matter.
I'm not joking though.
I said I wasn't joking.
- Jin Young...
"- Do you not want to, PD?"
- Jin Young...
"- Do you not want to, PD?"
What do you mean?
I'm so thankful!
Top star Sin Joon Young is proposing that we date.
"If I said I didn't like it, I would be crazy!"
PD No!
"- How much law do you know, lad?"
- I was just guessing.
"So Scott-Padget's gonna rule the roost, run the ship his way."
- It's a chance.
- What for?
Scott-Padget.
Stab him in the back.
Give him Jonah's toss.
- Don't be a fool.
- Now look would the captain care if he died?
We're after bigger things than one man.
And we'll get them with patience.
- That's the only word you know.
- I know this:
If we touch one officer our whole cause is lost.
Do you think he heard?
That old drunk?
What's it matter?
- Didn't I tell you to clean this up?
- I did.
You call this clean?
It seems I have to teach you another lesson.
Come here.
- I hope I'm not disturbing you.
"- Not in the least, Mr. Goss."
I thought I should report that...
Report what?
Wheatley's recovering from punishment.
The others are back on duty.
You told me all this yesterday.
"Really, I wish, sir, to make a suggestion."
"Well, forgive me if I..."
You can read my mind!
You really understand me.
You talk in such a romantic way!
"It's late, let's go to bed."
That's good.
You first.
"No, you first..."
Come on!
"No, I mean, I dare not, I really dare not."
"Come on, just give me some face."
"No, I..."
"Alright, I'll listen to you."
I think my husband doesn't like me any more.
"We have married for 7 years, and I went to Britain for one year."
He didn't look at my eyes when he talked to me.
"I can't help, so I didn't look at his eyes when I talked to him too."
"Foon, he sent me to university and wanted me to study law, actually, I studied something else."
What's that?
Fashion design.
What kind of subject is it?
Needlework.
Woo!
What a wonderful world.
The world has changed a lot!
Even needlework can be a subject in the university!
So you should go out to see the world.
You've rung my bell!
A man should fight for his future!
I think I should go somewhere!
"Maybe the nearest city, Hong Kong."
Are you going to Hong Kong?
"Yes, Master."
I only asked.
This is an outrage.
I'm warning you.
I have powerful friends in London.
You'll hear more of this.
[Door shuts]
[Door opens]
You're going through a lady's room.
No gentleman would behave this way.
"No, you're right."
"But then again, murder isn't a very gentlemanly business, miss harwood."
I can't imagine what you hope to find.
"It seems on the night of the murder, you left the room before the shots were fired."
Who told you that?
I have nothing to hide.
"I hate the dark, I always have."
It's like claustrophobia.
"As soon as the lights went out, I had to get back here."
In the dark?
I told you.
I wasn't thinking.
I just had to get out.
Just a minute.
"Foyle, is this the way your men amuse themselves?"
I've had enough of this.
I'm not gonna be pushed around by some bloody stuffed shirt.
I want to leave.
"Still not possible, I'm afraid."
Fleming:
"I said, I want to go!"
"Officer, arrest this man."
Thank you.
"This isn't working, Allan."
"You are always so distant, so concerned with climbing the ladder."
"For us, Syd."
It was always for us.
I believe you.
I do.
"But somewhere along the line, you actually forgot about me."
"I mean, look at us."
We don't even fight with passion anymore.
"The hot and cold I can take, but this numbness in between..."
So does that make this all okay?
"No, it doesn't make it okay."
But don't pretend like I'm the only one with secrets.
Look at your face.
You think I actually believe that was an accident?
"No, I just was trying to get ahead, Syd."
That's all I've ever done.
"Well, maybe trying to get ahead, you just fell behind."
Okay.
I'll go...
I'll go get a hotel.
"Allan, wait..."
"Can I get a J D straight up, please?"
Big night ahead?
Epic.
You okay?
Yeah.
Thank you.
Can I get another one?
"Preferably in a bigger glass, if you don't mind."
"That's the biggest glass I got, sir."
I guess I'll be keeping you busy then tonight.
None of them fit.
I'm not paying for it!
I didn't say a thing.
"Jimmy was so pissed off, he didn't even say good-bye."
Stop with those fuckin' drugs.
They're making your mind into mush!
Ya hear me?
I'll take 'em back.
I knew my Pittsburgh guys always wanted guns.
"And since I was going to see them later in the afternoon, to pick up a delivery I was pretty sure I'd get my money back."
"Oh, my God."
"When I finally got there at the hospital to pick up Michael, his doctor wanted to put me in bed."
Jesus Christ!
What happened to you?
I almost got into an accident driving' over here.
And I said I was partying all night.
"No, I'm fine, doc."
Get over here.
Let me check you out.
"He took mercy on me, gave me Valium and sent me home."
"Now, my plan was to drop off my brother at the house and pick up Karen."
There it is.
You see that helicopter right there?
Right in front of us there.
I think it's been following me all morning.
-Get the fuck out.
Are you nuts?
-l'm telling you.
It's the third time I've seen it.
At the hospital I saw it.
I had to make some stops.
I've seen it every time.
"- No, I can't deal with this."
- You have a strange way of dressing.
"- See you, Sis."
I'll see myself out.
Locker rooms abound in peckers.
- He positioned himself oddly.
- You're such a prude.
"Christ, it's not really that bad."
- I rather like it.
- It's sweet.
But it's not art.
It's crap.
"Artistically, it's a piece of crap."
- It is bad.
- But not for an old lady.
"Still, do we want to buy it or burn it?"
"You're such a snob, Casper."
"Because a handicapped person painted it, you think it's crap."
- I think it's crap because it is.
- Only because a handicapped...
I've got nothing against handicapped people.
I like them.
- Sometimes your view of people...
- I've got nothing against retards.
Not the slightest.
Casper even shagged a retard.
You've been with a retard?
"Casper, have you?"
"- Yes, but it was before your time."
- I don't care when it was.
"Jesus Christ, you always think with your prick!"
At least I don't give monotonous head.
She was probably raped like her sister.
Help me turn her over.
She was forced from behind too.
They have been in the water for two days.
- Where does this road lead?
- To the river.
- What are those photos for?
- El Caso.
- How did you find out?
- I got a call.
- Who?
- I don't know.
Get out of here.
Weren't you listening?
Get the hell out of here!
"I'm leaving, I'm leaving!"
Go on.
Handle this discreetly and solve it as soon as possible.
I promise you'll be rewarded.
"The harvest begins soon, and we can't lose it."
We already have enough problems with the strike.
Your ticket back to Madrid.
"They weren't killed here, there's no blood."
Someone drove them here and dumped them.
The tire tracks double back.
He changed his mind and turned around.
Maybe he saw someone and got nervous.
Someone has to tell the parents.
"You're from here, they know you."
You guys do it.
We have to see them every day.
I'll do it.
You can see the different strings unifying the dimensions.
The gravitational infinities canceling each other out.
You see them.
"Right, Dr. Bryar?"
You see them because you have the tools.
Your mind is that tool.
"- He's one of them, Ted."
One of them.
- Shut up!
It's going on too long.
I'm going in.
"And I have to believe that if you put your mind to it, you'll realize that only you can make Leo stop."
You can make him stop by understanding him.
By understanding that he is a liar and he only wants bad things for you.
"- I need to believe that, Dr. Bryar."
"- I said kill him, Ted!"
I had to.
He was going to kill us.
I had to.
God forgive me.
We need an ambulance.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's a little late for all that.
You going to the hospital?
I'm going to ride in with the psychiatrist.
See you over there.
- She going to be all right?
- Yeah.
I think so.
"Gideon, will you tell him that I don't need to go to the hospital?"
Buy passage far from Capua and the things that have been done to you.
- Where did you get this?
- Spirited from Gaia's things.
They will not be missed.
You fade with each day.
Do not make me bear witness to your passing.
- Come with me.
- I attend Domina.
My absence would be noticed.
"Go, before contest is ended."
"I will see you again, one day."
I swear to you.
Go.
A match for the ages.
I shall miss this.
Water.
"Crixus, victor."
Why did you drop your guard?
You are champion now.
That is all that matters.
I would not thought it possible.
To be said of many things this day.
"Quintus, it's not too late..."
Father?
Fetch the Medicus!
"Your father burns high fever, a worrisome condition for a man of his years."
"Well, is there nothing to be done?"
I have not the herbs.
And the hour is late for us to procure them.
Go.
I'll watch over him.
I'll pound on every door in Capua until we have what is needed.
Who's the lucky one?
"Let me do it, Hoffy."
You want to go?
No.
I just want to draw.
"Okay, draw."
"Suppose we call this my tag, I'll take him out."
"No volunteers, Price."
I said we're all in on it.
You guys elected me Security.
"The way things have been going I guess I've done a poor job, and I wanna make up for it."
- That asking too much?
- We've all done a poor job-.
I still say this is my tag.
"Any objections, Hoffy?"
"- Any objections, men?"
-Not from me.
- He can have it.
-Who are we to argue with a hero?
"- How about me latching on, Price?"
-Three is a crowd especially if you've got to cut through wire.
Let's have the wire cutters.
- Are the civilian clothes ready?
-Coming up.
Get to work on the trap door.
"What do you say, Hoffy?"
We hit the air-raid trenches then cut out back of Barracks 9.
You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
Why the south latrine?
Because that's where he is.
In the water tank.
Good spot.
"Warm, nurturing, homebody."
- It's my mom's.
- You live at home at your age?
"Well, yeah, it's temporary."
"See, I used to live in New York."
I moved to L.A.
- Because I had this fiancée...
- Should have seen her apartment.
Steel.
What is it with people that want to live in a warehouse?
"Hi, I'm Nora."
- How do you do?
I'm Elise.
- You have something you need to do?
I do.
I'm organizing the linen chest.
I'll be quiet as a mouse.
"Elise, when do you think I'll have my first date?"
Don't get ahead of yourself.
We do have work.
"Your dating techniques, your appearance, your hair."
What...
What's wrong with my hair?
- A little product wouldn't hurt.
- I don't need product.
"No, just for a little volume."
"Now, I need to prep you on what you're going to say."
"Oh, well, you know, I'm..."
"I know that I look young, but I've actually been dating for about 20 years, so I..."
And yet you've never sealed the deal.
"Well, maybe I've never wanted to ""seal the deal."""
- Don't be defensive.
I'm the happiest man in the world because the wedding is off.
"And furthermore, if you ever come to this house again..."
I'll break every bone in your body.
Do you understand that?
"- Red, is that call for me?"
"- No, it's my dame."
"Okay, sweetheart, and a great big juicy kiss for you."
Wait a minute.
Give me a chance to get my dough back.
- Give us a roll.
- Here it comes...
You ought to marry those dice.
Marry?
Holy cats!
What time is it?
"- Pop, my pants!"
- You've got them on.
"Oh, yeah."
Wait a minute!
You're not going with all our dough.
I got to get married.
I'll bet you the bankroll you don't get married.
That's a bet.
No cuffs.
The tailor says those kind of pants shouldn't have cuffs.
What?
Nice fellows!
Hello.
Where's everybody?
"Why, the guests have all gone, sir."
Did you wish to be announced?
Just let me get my hands on that young man and I'll strangle him!
Leave for Pondi right away.
Stay there in Hotel Blue Diamond.
Room will be booked.
I'll send you the details over there.
Remember I want this car any how.
It's a gift for my wife.
"Sir, Which wife?"
One who's Bandra or the one who's in Varli?
Why is he so angry?
Laila always checks the car thoroughly before she buys is to sell.
"Madam, My car!"
"This car of yours, I can't sell it."
Nobody can sell it now.
We are from the ICUC Bank.
"Madam, You took a loan of 2500000 for this show room of yours."
And you haven't paid your installments since ten months.
Actually we are here to give you a notice.
What notice?
"If you don't pay in 5 days, we'll take all of your cars."
You can't do this.
We can do it Madam because we are scoundrels and bastards.
I'll call the police.
We are the police.
We work part time with the bank.
"Okay Ma'am, Have a good day."
Brother.
Give size 40 in this material.
What are you doing?
I'm taking out sister's bra.
"Shut up, Son of bra."
If not Bra then what?
Pajama?
Why don't you help us out?
Will you come?
I think I'd like that.
Fine.
"Good night, and thanks."
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Betty Anderson's father stopped me.
- What did he want?
"He asked when you'll marry Betty, before or during college."
- I hadn't exactly thought of marrying her.
- I wouldn't hear of it if you wanted to.
"Anderson's a good foreman, but Betty is something else."
"- Yeah, I agree."
- Then stop seeing her.
I just can't stop seeing her.
I invited her to the graduation dance.
- Uninvite her.
"- Now, Dad, I can't do that."
You're gonna.
Do you realize what it'd mean if you married the local tramp?
"When you marry, you'll marry someone on your own level."
Call and tell her it's off.
- Are you trying to kill me?
- Call her.
"- Please, Dad."
"- Go on, call her!"
"1042W, please."
"I can understand you wanting to see this girl, but not in public."
You know what I mean.
Nobody's fighting you.
I'll be as big a Harrington as you are.
He's worried about her.
So I hope we are ...
Yes?
What do you say?
We're talking about cultural abyss?
A colleague who cut the fire rope to protect her.
Not to mention that he exploded right after all.
Was it because he was afraid of her?
He was afraid that she would kill?
Or something?
"Nixon, where are you?"
Hi.
'I brought you coffee. 'I'm not drunk.
I did not find it.
I know encrenco me sometimes.
but I will be able to stand?
You can not be better than that?
I took these.
Do not worry.
Mom and I arrange.
He barely had become a full member.
A larger funeral costs more money.
We can do it be worth it even if it is small and intimate.
-Let's Take it together.
-What Do you think of the club?
They cared about him.
And me.
We should not think about it?
"I refuse to go there, even for a funeral ..."
It was my husband.
I who decides.
The Ferrymen is more than a club of motorcyclists.
- I never applied.
"Oh, my God."
I cannot believe he actually did it.
"Months ago, Chuck joked about applying for you."
He said you had too much pride to admit N.Y.U. Was a mistake.
Looks like he actually did something right for once.
Congratulations.
"Oh, thanks."
You're not at the gala?
Yeah.
I thought it'd be best for everybody if I didn't go.
I see my father is still working his magic.
It's not all him.
"Yes, it is."
It's just that no one else sees it.
You make my mom happier than all of her ex-husbands combined.
"It should be you with her tonight,"
Not some guy who pulled a disappearing act.
"Well, I am already in the tux."
"Elliot, what are you doing here?"
Your father invited me?
He said he didn't think you had plans tonight.
Not me.
I hope that's okay.
"It's okay to be mad at him, Eric,"
"But it's okay to let him try to make it right, too."
All right.
I'm heading out.
Wish me luck.
You don't need it.
You're the only one for her.
After Dr. Van Der Woodsen organized
I can give you one of our lorries.
That's all I can do.
- I'll drive these people away from here.
- To the Promised Land?
Is that what you're fighting for?
I don't think you understand what we're fighting for.
Let's move on.
"We're moving on, guys."
We've got to get away.
- Thank you.
- We'll give them a lorry for their escape.
"Come on, get up there."
Hurry up.
"- Mariá, Mariá!"
"- Hurry up, get up on the lorry."
"- Hurry up, there's no time to lose."
- Get a move on.
Hurry!
"You too, hurry up."
What are you waiting for?
Come on.
He's in there.
Open the door.
Why are you snooping around here?
You're mumbling.
We can help your friend escape.
Someone we trust will handle that.
- And who is he?
- A member of the militia.
Water.
"The president's men seem to consider your friend very important, so the price for his escape should reflect this."
Silveira's men are corrupt?
He's always doing fine.
"You won the Pulitzer Prize in fiction, the Nobel Prize for literature."
That's a lot of pressure on a little suicide note that you know everybody's gonna read.
It's just so dark.
Doesn't even sound like him.
But dark is good.
Dark's like the new black.
Look at Louis CK.
Got his own show.
He's dark.
"If I was gonna kill myself, I know exactly what I'd do."
"I would, uh..."
I'd kill myself with kindness.
"Take a handful of pills, hop in bed."
Maybe some Enya.
In some countries...
Get this.
"In some countries, it's illegal to commit suicide."
It's against the law for you to kill yourself.
Okay?
Are you with me here?
"Sir, I want you to focus, okay?"
I realize you're dead.
Step out of the vehicle and put your hands behind your back.
"If you wanna play tough guy, we've got all night, all right?"
"Handcuffs seem like overkill, but I have to arrest you."
You have the right to remain...
Bad law.
- Hello?
"- Hey, Chelsea."
"It's me, Julia."
- I've been trying to call Eddie.
"Hello, Virginia."
"Um, my mother is not one-night-stand material."
"Yeah, you're right."
It wasn't night and we weren't standing.
Hey-oh!
That didn't happen.
You're right.
It didn't.
You just winked.
"No, I didn't."
You just did it again!
"Look, bottom line:"
I need you to proxy bang this girl for me.
Be my stand-in and put your gland in.
"Hey, wow, that'd be good on a hat."
"Barney, she's just using me for my gracefully aging body."
You're picking now to get some self-respect?
You once banged a blind girl by pretending to be Sean Connery.
That was you.
"Yeah, that conquest was most enjoyable."
I'm sorry.
"T-To hook up with a girl,"
I have to connect with her at least a little.
Then find a connection.
Just go simple.
"Nothing about weird poets or buildings or any of those stupid articles you've ever e-mailed me with the subject line ""Food for thought."""
"Please, Ted."
I need this.
Fine.
You win.
I'll bang a hot 20-year-old.
But I'm not gonna enjoy...
Horatio.
So soon ?
I was just prepping the shooting vic from the condo.
"Alexx, is that a void in the blood ?"
I think our boy was wearing a wire.
"Yes, it looks that way."
You don't seem surprised.
Is that a fingerprint right there ?
Yeah.
"Whoever removed this wire, left his print in the adhesive."
Who was this guy ?
No one goes to this much trouble over a dead dealer.
We do.
We have an audience.
"Yes, we do."
"Give me a minute, will you, Alexx ?"
John... u can't be here.
How'd this mope get out ?
- Cop killers don't get early release...
"- John, I need you to stay out of this."
Stay out of this ?
Bob Keaton down there killed my partner.
Your brother.
What is it you're not telling me ?
I don't have that information yet.
You don't have that information ?
I've been on the outside since the day Raymond died.
"Yes, you have."
And it probably kept you alive.
What's this about ?
I don't know yet.
Just raises so many questions.
Or a selective one.
You want me to refresh it for you?
"I'm sorry, John."
Here it is.
The off-ramp costs me five million.
Another $35 million for the subway stop.
You'll get some from me.
The rest I got to beg Albany.
I got better things to beg for from Albany.
I got a solution.
How about a spur off the Canarsie Line?
- Are you crazy?
A spur is $ 120 million a track mile.
BankExchange is good for the poor.
It's good for the jobless.
It's good for the whole city.
"As for subway stops, infrastructure, off-ramps we can't afford it."
"Then, you'll have to forget the whole thing."
I love the second act opener.
Then you won't want to miss it.
"""This Was a Real Nice Clambake."""
I'm building up my IOU's with Albany.
The governor needs to step up with a new subway stop or I won't support him for reelection.
And the off-ramp?
Next year.
- It's already in my budget.
- Next year's too far.
"You're only a boss, Frank."
I'm the fucking mayor.
Mayors rule.
BankExchange.
My way or the highway.
Mom says you're not allowed to call me that.
"Well, it all started three weeks ago when I got into a small but very severe car accident."
"- Oh, my gosh."
- What's the other thing
Dr. Ellie told Anna-Kat to do to stay calm?
"Oh, yes!"
Sing a song in your head!
No!
Not that song!
Too late!
♪ Don't let them in ♪
♪ Don't let them see ♪
♪ Be the good girl you always have to be ♪ ...stops.
I hit him.
- Oh!
"- So I'm driving... ♪ Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know ♪"
♪ But now they know ♪
What are you doing?
We spent three years getting that song out of this house.
It's spilling out.
♪ Let it go ♪
♪ Let it go ♪
"Oh, dear Lord."
♪ Can't hold it back anymore ♪
"Honey, you have got to calm down."
Isn't it a good thing your mom has someone to talk to?
"Now we've got the neediest woman in the world coming together with the biggest attention whore in the world, which is exactly what I was trying to avoid."
"So, no!"
Not good!
I'm gonna use a word...
Selfless.
You didn't want to ruin their holiday by not showing up.
"You didn't tell them what it was about, did you?"
No.
I swear to you I wouldn't tell anyone.
"This is bad, Max."
I got to go.
"Can I have a lemonade, please?"
Shh...
How well do you know your boyfriend?
You all right?
Not so good.
Why won't you let me assign you some protection?
I don't need a baby-sitter.
You must need something or you wouldn't be here.
I need to know if this is Sara's blood.
Where this come from?
"I'll tell you, if it's hers."
How long is it gonna take?
You can use my phone to call your father.
Not right now.
"He's worried sick, Marcy."
You should think about it.
Got a call from Judge Rainer.
He wants to stop by.
No.
"It's not about the confirmation, Senator."
He wants to stop by as a friend.
You think right now I give a damn about Wallace Rainer?
"Jeffrey, that hearing isn't till the day after tomorrow."
If there's something you're not telling me...
All right.
This afternoon.
He's got ten minutes.
too hard for this guy.
No risk of getting hurt.
But is this right for me?
I'm kind of sensing a pattern here.
"You've got this great, beautiful chest on you with great definition."
You probably bench press quite a bit.
Is Seven right about me?
I hate for Seven to be right because he's always right about that kind of stuff.
"I mean, seriously I don't think that's jerky..."
I need a sign.
Is this right for me?
I got this great idea.
I know you're gonna love it.
Fitness fanatics.
It's my reality TV show.
Check please.
Separate checks?
Yeah.
Hi.
"Ready, Freddy?"
"We're walking, right?"
You don't want to drive?
"You guys, it's two blocks."
"They have valet parking, you know."
So where's Hallie this morning?
I don't know.
"I saw her on Tuesday, and I haven't seen her for the rest of the week."
You know that she changed her...
status to it's complicated?
What does that mean?
It's... complicated?
With who?
"Well, what if they find it on you?"
"Don't worry, they won't."
Wait a minute.
I think I just figured it out.
I'm sending a man around to the apartment.
He'll give you a scalp massage.
He'll have the merchandise in his pocket.
I got it.
Bye.
Which pocket?
Hello?
Would you like to try it one more time?
I should not like to try it one more time.
I should not like to see your face one more time.
"Allow me, sir."
Thank you.
Not at all.
"Could you help me, monsieur?"
It is lunchtime.
But my wife would like a treatment at home.
"Oh, the wife would like a treatment."
"Oh, monsieur!"
"Oh, but I cannot leave the shop."
"Oh, it'll be all right, Francois."
I am not Francois.
"Oh, I'll speak to him personally."
"Oh, well, if you think it will be all right, monsieur."
I should like very much to give the wife the treatment.
Thank you very much.
I shall get the equipment.
I think I have everything.
I appreciate this.
This court is adjourned.
[chattering ]
"Nathan, get your father out of sight."
"All right, listen up."
I don't care what the judge says.
You can't murder a citizen of Eagle Bend and get away with it.
"So, by God, if they won't hang him, we'll do it for them."
You heard the judge.
Go home.
You stole my bullets.
"Now, careful, mister, we'll send them back."
stains:
Uh-huh.
It sure is easy to look tough...
... whenyouhaveloadedweapons and we don't.
"I guess you men wouldn't be interested in a fair fight, would you?"
"Well, I think we can manage a fair fight."
"-What do you say, boys?"
"-Oh, I love a fair fight."
[MEN grunting ]
[GUNSHOT]
Leave my boy alone.
"Sheriff, I could kill you right now."
"But truth be told, I don't want to."
"You want to kill me, but I ain't gonna kill you."
Because it ain't right.
You know that.
And I know that.
Justice has been done here today.
"Now, go home."
"Come on, get out of here."
Get on your horses.
- Who'll know?
Come on!
- A beast!
- Here I am.
"Oh, not you!"
Forget it.
- Squire?
What squire?
- You know what squire.
"Oh, my rheumatism."
That cell was so damp.
Two whole nights.
"Oh, you poor dear."
"Come, let me undress you and put you to bed."
It must have been an awful experience.
It was.
"Oh, Betty."
Your hands are so soft and warm.
"You don't really think there was a squire up here in our bed, do you?"
- Well...
- Do you?
"Come, let me take those off."
And that.
Doesn't that feel better?
"Bernard, my darling."
Come.
Citizens nobles gentry!
The king.
Me?
"Oh, yes."
"Good Sir Knight, you have proved your worth on the field of honour."
"And now you must prove yourself in mortal combat with a monster so terrifying, so awe-inspiring, so horrible so soul-destroying that even I would hesitate to meet it face to face in hand-to-hand combat."
"Well, that could be good."
You've always liked art.
"So you'd study graphic design, that sort of thing?"
"Uh, maybe a bit, but..."
"Yeah, uh..."
I think that whatSarah wants to do is to be an artist.
"You know, the, uh..."
"And the thing is, she's good."
"You know, we went to her art class today."
To an art class?
Yeah.
She did this.
"Yeah, it's lovely."
But drawing is... a hobby.
It's not a career.
"Marjorie, don't."
Don't why?
It's true.
How many artists do you know who make a living?
Who aren't forced to waitress or clean houses?
"Mom, there's more to life than money, actually."
I know that's really hard for you to understand.
Sarah.
"Come on, Tom, you agree with me."
"I don't, actually."
It's Sarah's life.
And I don't think that shutting this down is the right thing.
Really?
Since when?
What?
Do you know what your dad told me last night?
"He said it killed him, waking up every morning, knowing that his daughter was living on the streets and throwing away her whole life."
Matt had me pretend that I was choking so we could get away.
"Except her dad was a doctor, so he jumped up to save her."
And I ran and slipped on the wet floor and bit it.
In front of everyone.
Do you remember that?
"Three stitches, a hangover for days and I was grounded from seeing this one for a week."
"Ha, ha."
"Well, I'm gonna go to the restroom."
- Elena
- Hm?
"Quick, hide."
We're not here.
Why?
Where did we go?
Children under our care at 5 o'clock.
This is not role-modelish.
Damn.
"Hey, so, what made you and your mom decide to stay in town?"
"Oh, she got this business opportunity."
She's gonna open up a little store.
It's always been her dream.
"So, yeah, we're staying."
And I'm thinking about going back to high school.
- So you'll be seeing a lot more of me.
"- Oh, yeah?"
Enough of homeschooling.
"You know, I'd like to be a normal teen for once."
But I have to ask my mom first.
She'll have an opinion.
I wish you were there now.
I have to write a paper.
I was thinking about squeezing one more out on the vampires of Mystic Falls.
"I don't own any forest land, do any milling."
"Just lumberyards, really."
Douglas is an attorney.
And a very good one.
- Do any trial work?
"- No, no."
Nothing as exciting as that.
I confine myself to handling the Harper interests.
That's a fancy way of saying he holds the purse strings.
I can't stand that vinegar you serve.
Where did you get that stuff anyway?
"The wine is lovely, Stan."
It just doesn't mix well with Scotch.
Now she's trying to tell me what to drink.
"It's not what you drink, Stan, it's how much."
"You are not married, are you, Mr. Gordon?"
No.
I'm a bachelor.
"Well, now, you just take my advice and you stay a bachelor."
"Please, try to ignore him, Mr. Gordon."
You can see that he's...
You can see that he is drunk.
"Right, Mr. Gordon?"
- He's back.
"- Yes, I think you're right."
"It's all right, Mr. Gordon."
Just be quiet.
It'll pass in a few moments.
Bobby.
"It's all right, Bobby."
We're here together.
"Go to sleep, Bobby."
It says the local DA is missing.
Good.
Get in touch with Lister this afternoon.
Tell him he did okay and he'll be paid in the usual way.
Okay.
What do you want?
- We're in trouble.
- What do you mean we're in trouble?
"Last night, Stan pretended to be drunker than he really was."
"After Douglas left, he sneaked down the back stairway."
- So what?
- Don't you understand?
He saw us.
He even took pictures.
He's a creep.
He's gonna use those pictures to divorce me.
- You let him.
- I won't get a cent from him.
- That's your problem.
- No.
"No, it's your problem too."
He's gonna smear us across every front page in this country.
I don't want that and you don't want that either.
I've had worse publicity than this and survived it.
Go home.
- Figured you'd run here and warn him.
- Wait a minute.
I've already waited long enough.
"I thought about you all night, Gordon."
I thought about my wife with a slime like you.
"- All right, buster..."
- Stay out of this.
"-But she looks so, so..."
-Shock is just a kind of a sleep.
It's an escape when the mind can't accept what it sees.
A few days care and she'll be out of it.
I guess I'd better tell Selena.
"And, Connie, just because it happened in your house... don't think that any of it was your fault."
-Somehow I do.
-You've got one thing to think of:
Allison.
"If you were going to get married, why didn't you tell me?"
-Because you wouldn't have approved.
-You never gave me a chance.
"At least, it would've been a proper marriage... not a cheap sneak-off weekend affair."
-Don't say that!
"-Well, what was it?"
-I'd like to talk to you alone.
-You can talk to both of us.
"This has to do with the business, not your wife."
-I'll wait outside.
"-Okay, honey."
I can get it annulled.
"Look, dad, I don't want any trouble between us."
"I was in love with Betty and I wanted to marry her, that's all."
You weren't in love.
You had an itching for her.
"She took you, son."
"Good-bye, dad."
-Don't bring her to the house.
-Then I won't be there either.
"Rodney, what about college?"
I'm not going.
I have a wife to support.
!
"No, Yoon Jae's home to get some clothes."
"Honey, Son-in-law seems different, doesn't he?"
"He doesn't seem to mind his manners, and he doesn't think too well of us."
He treats Da Ran with no care.
Right?
"You felt that too, right?"
Yes!
"Even so, I like him even more!"
I think he's comfortable with our family now!
"Now, he seems to be our son-in-law so I'm really happy!"
"Well, if it's because he's comfortable, it's a good thing."
Got it.
Come in faster.
Yoon Jae lives alone too?
His parents live overseas.
Don't just touch his stuff!
We have to hurry up and pack some clothes.
Oh!
I told you not to touch anything!
Come here.
This is where the clothes are.
Pick out some outfits to wear.
"Ah, you surprised me!"
What should I do when you take off your clothes like that?
"It's something you see all the time, so why are you so surprised?"
Change your clothes quickly.
It's something you always see.
Why are you just sneeking a peek?
Just look at it.
I've never seen it.
Why's she acting like that?
"Of course, and I cut her hair, dyed it, did her nails and I scrubbed her down well, front and back."
"My mother wasn't disabled, or mad."
"She was just a bit lazy, you know?"
My mother was beautiful and I didn't want her to let herself go.
What did your father say?
"Nothing, what could he say?"
Is he dead?
"Heavens, no."
He's living in Sweden.
"I guess, because..."
I haven't heard from him in ages.
Doesn't he come to see you?
No.
"He formed another family a long time ago, when he left my mother."
We're not in touch.
Why have you come to see me?
Me?
None.
What's your problem?
You must have one if you've come to see a psychiatrist.
"Loneliness, I guess."
Have you had sexual relations with a woman?
No.
Or with a man?
No.
I'd like to see you next week.
Am I not well?
"No, it isn't that, but..."
Your adolescence was what we might call special.
It wasn't that special.
It was.
Very special.
tomorrow?
"No, it's today!"
Better call the station.
"Wait, stop!"
How will we explain this situation?
"If they find out about us, you may have to quit."
Word will spread quickly.
So only I suffer?
I guess your post is safe.
"It'll be bad for me, too."
But your wife's the daughter of the deputy director.
"You may have to get a divorce, too."
Fine.
Then you leave first.
I'll report this after you leave.
Look!
Someone was killed!
"Silly, she was just on her period."
So dark.
Apparently it was a murder.
Where?
The hotel next door.
It's a mess with police and ambulances.
Our customers can't come and go with all that tape.
"Suzuki San, could you man the front desk?"
Sure.
"Hey, you can't go in, stay back!"
"Okay, okay."
Looks awful.
Who was killed?
That streetwalker.
"A price dispute with a customer... led to the killing, apparently."
"Well, I don't have it."
- Is there anything else?
- Yeah.
Why did you bring them back here in the first place?
I was hungry.
My last meal left me just a little unsatisfied and they were yummy.
You might think about curbing that appetite.
"Hey, hairy palms, what's it to you?"
You jealous much?
I have to find Olivia before she hurts someone else.
"In the meantime, keep the door locked and your eyes open."
- Where are you gonna look for her?
- Furies always have sisters.
"Big, strong Dyson."
Is it true you're a cop now?
How tame.
I know Olivia's sick.
Tell me where she is so I can help her.
Someone tried to kill our sister.
No one we don't trust gets near her.
"Ladies, we're here under the auspices of The Ash, okay?"
Wanna mess with that?
"- Well, we can't get her out."
- That's why you bring a Siren.
I promise.
We'll do what we can for her.
It cuts the stems and pulls off all the pretty petals.
Someone's breaking in!
Not asleep.
Not me.
I'm fine.
- I gotta go check on our house guest.
My logic is undeniable.
My logic is undeniable.
Can we be of service?
Chief?
"Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved."
How may I be of service?
Sonny!
"Yes, detective?"
Calvin's fine!
Save me!
"All NS-5s, report for service and storage."
"All NS-5s, report for service and storage."
"All NS-5s, report for service and storage."
One thing bothers me.
Alfred was V. I. K. I. ' s prisoner.
I don ' t understand why she would kill him.
She wouldn't want police snooping around.
That's true.
But then V.I.K.I. didn't kill the old man.
"Did she, Sonny?"
No.
He said I had to promise.
Promise to do one favor for him.
He made me swear before he'd tell me what it is he wanted me to do.
He made me swear.
Then he told you to kill him.
He said it was what I was made for.
His suicide was the only message he could send to you.
The first bread crumb.
The only thing V.I.K.I. couldn't control.
Lanning was counting on my prejudice to lead me right to you.
"Are you going to arrest me, detective?"
I wouldn't have a chance with Bridon.
He can be with any girl he wants!
There you go.
"Feel better, p-pal?"
What am I supposed to do?
I can't just sit back and watch some kid steal my girlfriend away.
"I mean, Wendy says she'd never leave me for him, but what if she just doesn't wanna hurt my feelings?"
"She said he could get any girl he wants, and that means if he wanted, he could have my girl."
This is all so crazy.
"I mean, really, how could my day get any worse?"
"No, no-- no, I'm not doing it."
I'm not doing it!
"No, fuck off, I'm not doing it!"
"Aw, jeez, you're no fun."
"- Hey, Bridon!"
- Hey.
"- Hi, Bridon."
- Hi.
"Hey, Bridon!"
Hey.
"Hey, kid, over here."
"Hey, uh, listen..."
"You know this whole singing and dancing thing you do,"
"I think you need to, uh, ease off a little bit."
Huh?
"Yeah, look, I know you think the kids in school like you, but actually they're all getting really annoyed."
- They are?
"- Yeah, you don't know 'cause you're just a third grader, but take it from me, you're driving everyone crazy."
I don't blame them.
All that singing and dancing-- I can't stand it.
You don't like doing it?
It just isn't me.
It tore her apart.
My father'll be happy now.
"""Not the girl."""
My mother and I were always telling him that.
But she turned out just like him.
Don't upset yourself.
What time is it?
It's been four hours.
THREE WEEKS LATER
You're going home?
Yes.
"I'd like to stay, but I can't."
You know there's nothing more we can do here.
Our bar's been closed for three weeks.
The kids are with a neighbor and I've neglected this man.
If anything should happen you can get here in two hours.
You can be sure of that.
We must have faith.
Faith?
"I keep lighting candles, but I'm finding it hard to have faith."
When can we put her medals back on?
Not yet.
"With all that she's got, the injuries, the tracheotomy..."
She never took them off.
- I'll get a vase.
- Thank you.
I have to go to America for three months.
My agent says it's important.
But...
The way things are here...
I don't want to go.
Can you go outside for a moment?
!
Just write whatever you want!
I don't care!
It's not my homework!
It's your homework!
"Well, this time, we're just gonna have to make it fun."
Write it down.
Write it down!
Why aren't you writing it down?
!
That's not how Ms. Rinsky told us to do it!
"- Well, how did she say to do it then?"
- I don't know!
- Just write it down!
- We're supposed to show our work.
"Well, you didn't do any work!"
I did.
You should show her a picture of me.
Are you sure there's not some other instructions that
"Were sent home or something, something you might have lost?"
"Oh, yeah."
You know what?
There is.
There's a big ol' packet of instructions with
"All the answers to everything we'd ever want to know,"
And I've been hiding it from you.
"Well, go get 'em!"
Mom!
"Oh, no!"
It's your turn to go help aunt Edie and aunt ginny.
I went last week.
"Yeah, but last time, I accidentally drank"
- Benvolio!
Welcome.
And with Verona's news?
I do bring news.
It's true.
Then spit it out.
How does my lady?
Is my father well?
How does my Juliet?
"See, I ask it twice."
Then I must answer once... to say the worst.
Her body sleeps among the Capulets... in the great monument that marks their fame.
Juliet is dead?
Only her mortal part.
Her soul lives on in heaven's blessed care.
You know this or you heard a story told?
I saw her laid inside her kindred's vault.
"That done, I came as quick as I could find a horse to bring me."
"Pardon me, cousin... that I come with a tale so full of grief."
And it is so?
Then I must hurry.
Jack!
I beg you give yourself some time.
You must be riven with a savage grief and need a while to calm your raging thoughts.
"Cousin, you're deceived."
I know my mind.
Are there no letters to me from the friar?
"No, my good lord."
No matter.
Go with Jack.
Get fresh water for your horse.
I'll meet you by the city gates.
"You haven't spoken to me for over a week, since... ."
"Allison, I understand how you feel."
You'll just have to accept what's happened and make the best of it.
Mother.
"As soon as I can, I'm going to get dressed pack my things and leave Peyton Place."
I never want to see this town or you again.
- You can't mean that.
- I mean it.
I'm going to New York.
"Please, Allison."
I was only trying to protect you.
I was an accident you hated and tried to hide.
But I loved you from the moment you were born.
Try to believe me.
"Well, how will you live?"
What'll you do for money?
I have enough to get there.
I'll find a job.
Suppose you can't find a job?
"Then I'll live off some man, the way you did."
God.
"God, help me."
Allison.
Allison.
Didn't want you to come here.
I couldn't say goodbye to you in person.
- You know I don't want you to go.
- But I'm going.
You stay here.
"You belong here, both of us, together."
- We've been friends since we were kids.
"- Goodbye, Selena."
"Dad, I need to tell you something."
I passed the exam.
Good job.
God bless you son.
When do you think you'll be here?
"Dad, please."
"I beg you, don't..."
We're going to introduce you to a nice girl.
"Dad, what could I possibly do there?"
"Apply for your military service, and come back to Urfa."
"Yourpast, yourfuture, your destiny..."
It's all here...
He doesn't care.
Why couldn't you ask about the police station?
Why didn't you make him come back?
I'll find a way.
He's got little left to finish.
While we eat shit there?
You are bankrupt.
We're living in misery and he dishonors us.
You even sold yourgold teeth.
People are laughing at us.
We were taken to the police.
"People make fun of us on the streets, in the mosques..."
"I'd give you anotherson right now, but it takes a real man."
I gave you a son and a daughter.
Yourson didn't turn out to be a man.
"Stop this nonsense, Kezban."
God damn you...
You faggot.
He took after you.
What have you got here?
ADRIAN:
It's me.
I'm not going to be left out.
I'm not interested in you.
Where's Clementine?
What are you doing here?
Why shouldn't I be here?
I'm friends with all of you.
"Er...well, nothing now."
You know what he does to his victims.
He lures them off trains by gaining their trust.
"He gets them alone, kills them."
Lots of people kill.
What does he do specifically?
Er...
He takes them somewhere dark...underground.
It's strange.
They're such pretty girls yet he wants them in the dark.
Go on.
"He strangles them, he waits until they're dead and then rapes them."
What else does he do?
Tell me.
They wear perfume.
"He puts them in cellars, Anderson shelters, confined spaces, things like that."
The smell of it becomes almost unbearable.
"You know who he is, don't you?"
What I'm going to tell you goes no further.
- It's entirely confidential.
- Mm-hm.
"But if there have been 12 deaths, I think I must tell you."
"There was a man, he worked for me."
Good at his job.
"And then, too, after- when I got married -"
My husband was a lawyer.
And he was very active in the community- the gentile community and thejewish community.
He was a controller for the city ofToronto... and his office was at the city hall.
He worked for this place.
My husband's picture's the first picture you see when you walk in.
It's still there.
The entrance when you come into this building.
One day I would like to go downstairs with you.
Would you show it to me?
- Yup.
- I would like to see that.
- By all means.
- I would love to see that.
Any day you're ready.
- One day we'll do that.
- Okay.
- Okay.
It's a date.
- Okay.
- All right.
Right in the front entrance.
- Right in the front entrance -
- Wow.
- The first picture you see as you walk in.
"You know, there are a lot of pictures hanging from the ceiling."
There's a lot of pictures.
Yeah.
"- Well, he's there."
- Let's do it.
All right.
Let's see if we can find him.
"- From their denture cup, so that should count for two!"
- I'd say three.
If aunt Edie asks me one more time
If I've had my BM...
Why does she care?
!
You know what?
You two should be ashamed of yourselves.
You should want to go over there and soak up every bit of wisdom
You can get from them!
"If I were you, I would consider it a privilege!"
Then why don't you go?
Because I'm trying to teach you to respect your elders...
And I did my time.
And you know what?
"Since you're fighting about it,"
You're both going.
That's not fair!
"Ohh, no!"
I don't want to hear another word.
Go.
No!
I don't...
ohh!
"We're useless, mike."
We can't even help our kid with third grade math.
Well...
maybe you should go
Talk to his teacher and get him some help.
"We were both banned, but I was banned first, so you have to go."
"Oh, I was banned last, so you should go."
"Okay, you know what?"
Haven't you been taking care of her?
I don't have too much money.
What about all the money that I gave you to hold for me?
I bought all these things.
I haven't been able to sell many of them.
It may interest you to know that some time ago
I heard that mother was starving in a little town called Podesin.
I couldn't get money even for myself.
Where's Zina?
Have you been taking care of her like I asked?
Yes.
"Well, at least I can thank you for that."
You're going to have to sell some of this stuff.
I need the money.
I'm going to marry Zina.
Where is she?
Zina!
They said you were killed in a German camp.
Did Gerry tell you that too?
Yes.
Gerry told me you were dead.
Well...
I'm glad I'm here to dispute that.
I married Gerry.
I'm his wife.
You didn't even have to tell me.
Mother always said that you were the one with brains.
I was the dreamer.
I was the dreamer they took to the Nazi prison.
"I loved you, Zina."
That was the dream.
And what became of it?
"Hey, is somebody down there?"
I didn't see you sign in.
Hey?
Is this somebody in here?
You're beautiful.
You already have me in bed.
You can stop.
"No, please continue."
It's a hell of a show.
Marcus?
Get dressed.
We're leaving.
"Wow, no!"
Wait.
"You don't wait, you don't listen to him!"
You get up and you get dressed now or I will kill you before you take another breath.
"You were here to close a deal, not to whore yourself out to a degenerate Pure Blood."
"Wouldn't you rather just, cut the insults and rip my throat out."
"Oh that's right you can't, because I am a Pure Blood."
And what are you?
You're just... infected.
Which is all you'll ever be.
"Doing our biddings, serving our will."
Yeah.
Vampires like you it's... nothing but pieces of meat.
They got a reprieve.
Thank you of reminding me of that.
Chase?
Chase?
It's getting dark.
It's time to go.
Where?
I knew it was wrong.
I thought someone would find them and mend them.
[Edith sobbing]
I didn't think I was being a traitor.
I was just so scared.
What will happen to me?
Will they hang me?
Will I go to prison?
No.
Don't have a case to answer.
You're free to go.
"Well, thank you."
It's ok.
"You're not going to forget David, are you?"
No.
"'Cause he was right, wasn't he?"
Yeah.
[Birds chirping]
"You should understand, Stanley, that you could go to prison."
But I haven't done anything.
"Yes, you have."
"You've lied to me, a police officer, and obstructed the course of justice."
"No, I didn't."
"You told me you hadn't touched anything when you went into your father's room, which isn't true, is it?"
You took your father's suicide note.
No.
There was pen and paper up there on the desk.
"And when I visited him in hospital, he was as surprised as I was that the note hadn't been found."
What did you do with it?
I destroyed it.
Why?
To...
What the hell was I thinking?
You said it we're not gonna get caught.
Hi!
"Lizzi, what happened?"
We were worried.
I've been running around like a crazy person.
Think you gave me the wrong address.
There's no book store on 3rd.
Oh my God!
Did I say 3rd?
I meant 13th.
I feel terrible.
"No, it's alright!"
I found a store that gave me a 40% book discount.
I'm so excited right now.
Did you tell the girls?
They loved the idea.
I'm gonna go in a girls' room and freshen up and we've to start planning.
ASAP cause I wanna be involved in every single detail.
Partez!
You're having a party?
Sure you've got enough liquor there?
"You know, smuggling liquor for a party."
"It isn't just a violation for you, it's gonna reflect poorly on all of us."
"Then it's a good think we only got diet soft drinks, Evian."
You gotta be kidding me.
You got him working for you now?
You with them?
"They're my friends, that's all."
"Actually, he's thinking 'bout pledging with us."
Just realized the Kappa Taus are a whole lot more fun than the Omega Chis.
Is that true?
- I know I promised.
- Won't you come for my birthday?
"Pramod, I'm really sorry..."
- I have to go to class.
Bye.
"- No, wait."
"So, here you are."
Please excuse the formalities.
You only need to read the last three pages.
Did Helene invite you to my birthday?
- No.
- You can't rely on her.
- Then I better do it.
- Thanks.
There are a few things I don't understand.
Can we look at it?
What does that mean?
It means that you and Anna have 100% control of the fund.
"No, not that."
Here it is.
The part where it says I have to live in Denmark.
"Yes, we haven't talked about that yet."
To build an organization like that you have to live in Denmark.
- Can't I just come to board meetings?
"- No, it's a demand on my behalf."
Why should I do that?
Because I said it's a demand on my behalf.
You mean that?
I can't spend half a year here and half a year there?
Have I said anything I don't mean?
"Maybe everyone else kisses your ass, but I won't."
- What do you mean?
"Come, give me a hand."
Come on.
That's it...
Excuse me so much!
I'm just a little dizzy.
Maybe I haven't eaten sufficiently today.
- Thanks a lot...
"- Don't be in such a hurry, Miss."
First I'll make you a nice cup of coffee.
So that you'll feel better.
"Bruno, bring the girl to the apartment."
I'll come by soon.
"- Many thanks, I really am fine again..."
- He's my brother!
Allow me:
Mechelke.
"Now just come here, Miss..."
And then nothing more.
No news and no address.
"Just poste restante, the main post office, Berlin."
My letters are there now.
He didn't even pick them up.
What do you want to do now?
Turn to the refugee centre?
Should I give the refugee centre a sob story?
That he promised me...faithfully his mother's ring.
He promised to return for me but then let me down till I cleared off to the West.
Away with it!
And I don't even know his address.
I won't be kicked to the curb like that!
I've had enough of compassion and humilation at home.
But I'll find him soon and settle the score.
Crap!
I thank the Lord that I've been blessed...
Let's thank the mums.
"Hello, mums."
"Here to keep an eye on Dad, are you?"
"Richie, it's not going very well, is it?"
...than my share of ha... ppiness
Ha ha ha.
"Thank you, one and all."
"Happy hunting and if you can't be good, be careful."
I've done that one.
Er...
"And if you're in a car, please drive safely."
"Thank you and good night, one and all."
I love you all.
"Well, tough crowd but I think I got the measure of 'em."
Ooh.
They probably couldn't afford flowers.
This will do for our dinner party.
"Richie, I've got some rather bad news for you."
- You're under arrest.
- That's the bad news.
I wasn't that bad.
I stumbled on a couple of punch lines.
It was our alibi-it collapsed.
"Mr Forsyth, he followed us here."
It's pris for us.
"- Are you coming quietly, sir?"
"- No, it's just the way I walk."
Note that down.
I want all to know I was still cracking woofers.
Woofers or ancient double entendre that everybody else gave up in the playground?
"You know, actually, we have a lot in common."
Okay. I'll bite.
"Well, we both went through tough divorces."
-Sherri was married?
-You didn't know that?
-lt never came up.
-What did come up?
Never mind.
Scratch that.
Where should I take her to dinner?
Where did you go so I can take her somewhere else?
Last thing you want is for her to start comparing you to me.
Exactly.
Wait.
What do you mean?
You want your relationship to stand on its own.
-Right.
"-Well, that's what I meant."
Okay. I thought you were trying to rub my nose in the fact that you dated her.
"Alan, I would never do that."
"Well, thank you."
I don't have to.
You think you could kill a guy with a piece of toast?
No.
"Because if you did, you could eat the toast."
The police would never find the weapon. it's the perfect crime.
And part of a nutritious breakfast.
"Okay, guys, I guess I'll see you later."
Where you going?
-Out for dinner.
-With who?
"Jake, look, I think-- l think you're old enough to know that your dad's not just a dad."
Plenty.
But that don't matter.
"Soon as I straighten out that old lady of yours,"
I'll take care of those smart double-crossers-
"One by one, from Curly down!"
And there won't be any mistaking who done it.
The Krozac trademark will be stamped all over them!
Come on.
Are you coming home with me?
"Yeah, I got a date with that dame in your watch fob."
My-my mother?
"Ok, call her that."
I guess I don't understand you at all.
"Mother and dads will be awfully glad, after all you've done."
"Yeah, I wonder."
"There's a lot of things you don't understand,"
"But you will soon enough, because you're my kind of a kid, see?"
I guess.
"It's awfully funny about those men thinking I was your son, isn't it ?"
"No, no, it isn't."
"Because you are my son, see?"
That's one thing you've got to get right now.
I can get home without you.
You don't need to come along.
"Now wait a minute, Joey."
"Just a second, Joey."
My name isn't Joey.
"It's Paul North, jr."
You're crazy if you say it's anything else.
I think you're all crazy anyway!
Let me alone!
Hey!
Arsey.
"Anyway, how can I help you?"
"Can you tell us who you issued this to, please?"
I can try.
Here we are.
6733.
"He gave the name of, T Dan Smith."
T Dan Smith.
A-ha.
That's what it says here.
"So, T Dan Smith, until recently, leader of the council, has fallen on hard times?"
"Well, probably not."
"Some people aren't comfortable about using their real names, you know."
And not just the thieves.
There's a lot of shame in falling on hard times.
Sad.
"Yeah, I can see the tracks of your tears."
Aren't you supposed to take their identities?
I'll tell Mr Dawson.
"I can do a full audit of this place, sir."
"Maybe get it shut down, you know."
"Hey, and I thought we were getting along."
What was pawned?
Four weeks ago.
And all on the one ticket.
~ All this?
~ Aye.
He said he'd be back for all of it.
"Mind, they all say that, like, but I believed him."
And all this is definitely his?
No question in my mind.
"Well, if he's half-inched anything, I'll be back to see you."
"Yours, you mean."
My interests are those of France.
All I can be is King.
You still do not seem to understand that.
And all I seek is a place of my own!
A little spot in the corner where I shall not be trampled upon.
It's that too much to ask?
The Canal du Midi serves all of France.
You cannot own it any more than I can.
What's this for?
So you don't have to steal it from me.
There is one way you can retain your commercial interests:
It would require you performing a service for me.
A service?
"The historian, Thomas."
You know him well.
I know him.
Get to know him better.
"I want him to trust you, implicitly."
Why?
Because he's a spy.
Let us through!
You want some?
"Yes, I want some."
"Are you, Matilde?"
"Yes, but I'm not on duty."
I'd like to have a word with you.
"I am a friend of Madamoiselle Masson, the doctor."
A kind soul.
Whatever happened to her?
She was murdered.
"the day before she died, she came here looking for poison."
Home.
"Mom, Dad, Morgan, our sister who loves us."
How do you beat that?
"""Entering Pottstown, home of the world's largest yogurt cup."""
He beat it.
"Eric, listen to me."
"We have to go home, and here's why."
I'm completely out of clean underwear.
"Eh, big deal."
I ran out a week ago.
I'm sitting pretty.
"Yes, but, you see, I don't know if you've noticed, but I've also run out of pants."
I want to go home.
I want you in pants!
"Well, are you happy, Eric?"
"Your brother's wearing yogurt pants, and let me tell you something."
One size does not fit all.
Now can we please just go home?
"Hey, not so fast."
They got a whole schedule of events here.
What kind of events?
It's a giant yogurt cup!
"Now, why can't you just experience something new you've never seen before?"
'Cause I don't wanna?
"Look. 4:00, we have the parade of sprinkles, 6:00, we got the march of the dancing lids..."
I don't want to be here after dark.
Just stand here...
And smile.
Say...
Big pink spoon.
"""Big pink spoon."""
"Well, I am proud to be on the arm of the grocery store manager of the year."
I'd have to be 10 scotches deep before I touch her.
10 scotches and a bag over her head.
Bastards.
I know.
I know.
Do they always talk about me that way?
"Oh, my God."
I shouldn't have played it.
"No, I-it's better that I know..."
who they really are.
"Martha, I-I've never been any good... at seduction or romance."
But I love the way you look.
I love every part of you.
"And if I could, I would go in there, and I would..."
"I know you would, Clark."
But I have a job.
A very important job.
And things are a lot worse than you know.
What?
Have you ever heard of Stealth?
No.
"It's a huge, complex military project."
"I don't understand it all, but there are a lot of leaks coming out -- we think -- of your office."
We've found it very difficult to find a source.
What do you need?
I so appreciate that.
I really do.
"- Let me help you, Clark."
"- No, it's dangerous."
I'm not afraid.
Do I love you?
You know you're everything to me.
"We need, like, a code of conduct for how far we're willing to go."
"Like you said, we can't just steal from normal people, right?"
You know what else?
"Bushido, the samurai code... the true warrior must hold that loyalty, courage, and honor are important above all else."
Nice.
- No old people.
- Sure.
Yeah.
No kids.
"No people who look, you know, sad."
Yeah.
No nice moms or dads... or anyone who's limping.
No babies.
What does that leave us?
"Hey, lady... next time get both hips replaced."
Assholes.
"Excuse me there, bud."
"You know, I seem to have gotten a little bit lost."
Maybe you could help me out here.
Sure.
I'm tourist information today...
where you going?
"So we are heading, um, to the east, and we need a..."
I'm trying to get on the 29 here.
"Yeah, that's where your finger's pointing..."
"- Right there, the 29."
- That's right.
But I-I can't figure out how to get to it.
See right out there where it says turn left to the 29?
That's how you get to the 29.
"Okay, that would make sense."
What?
Oh-- he likes it a lot.
- Yeah?
- What's it about?
- I'm kind of reworking it.
- It's fucking awesome.
Mickey!
"You haven't seen it yet, dude."
You told me about it.
Did you check out that apartment I told you about?
"Yeah man, it's the shit."
"Maggie, you got to see this place, it's a railroad flat on Ninth Street and Avenue C."
- Ninth Street?
"- Yeah, baby, it's great."
I'm not moving down there.
- It's already rented out.
- I don't care if it's rented out.
I felt like a little pendejita sitting there.
"I asked Danny 'cause it was an idea, and he looked into it."
You even went to go see it.
"It was beautiful, a gorgeous place with a lot of sunlight."
I felt like I could breathe for once in my life.
Really?
"Well, maybe you should go breathe by yourself."
I can't be without you.
Don't you get it?
"No, I don't, because you don't talk to me anymore."
- I don't know what you're doing.
- I was thinking about both of us.
"You sewing in the back and me drawing in the front,"
like we dreamed.
Like we talked about.
We've been here our whole lives.
- Right.
- Does that mean trees or...?
No.
"I don't own any forest land, do any milling."
"Just lumberyards, really."
Douglas is an attorney.
And a very good one.
- Do any trial work?
"- No, no."
Nothing as exciting as that.
I confine myself to handling the Harper interests.
That's a fancy way of saying he holds the purse strings.
I can't stand that vinegar you serve.
Where did you get that stuff anyway?
"The wine is lovely, Stan."
It just doesn't mix well with Scotch.
Now she's trying to tell me what to drink.
"It's not what you drink, Stan, it's how much."
"You are not married, are you, Mr. Gordon?"
No.
I'm a bachelor.
"Well, now, you just take my advice and you stay a bachelor."
"Please, try to ignore him, Mr. Gordon."
You can see that he's...
You can see that he is drunk.
"Right, Mr. Gordon?"
- He's back.
"- Yes, I think you're right."
"It's all right, Mr. Gordon."
Just be quiet.
It'll pass in a few moments.
Bobby.
* And your sister and your brother
"* And the poodle, too"
* That they'll never ever love you * like I do.
CHORUS:
* This fella won't love you like a relative
* This fella has lots and lots of love to give
* I know your uncle loves you
"* Your auntie loves you, too."
"Yes, of course."
* But no relative can possibly give what I could give to you.
That's true.
* I know your doctor loves you
"* Your dentist loves you, too"
I'm not so sure.
* No skill with a drill or vitamin pill

You're the doctor.

For little old me?

He hoped that I may help you fill it some how.
How are you going to do that?
I'm an interior decorator.
Oh yeah?
So why did sawamato pick you?
Oh yeah?
So why did sawamato pick you?
He said that was your choice.
That you had described exactly who you wanted.
So you work for him?
No.
Mr. sawamato is my god-father.
"So who is he, Vic?"
We don't know yet.
Don't know yet?
"That's very impressive, Vic."
"We're spread a little thin right now, dino."
"Yeah, right."
Shit.
What's this I hear about you and carmine settling down?
"We want to buy a house, you know."
"We want to buy a house, you know."
"A house, what like this house?"
"No, not like this."
What's wrong with this house?
"Oh come on, huh?"
I don't need anything big.
What the fuck does need have to do with it?
Do you think I need fourteen bedrooms?
Do you think I need eight rooms to take a shit in?
"Christ Vic, if all I had was what I needed,"
I would be living in a cardboard box with a fucking blow up doll.
You're weak and mute.
"God, damn you!"
You have no pride.
"You have no dignity, no honor."
Look at your honor...
It's being trampled on.
You're an absolute disgrace.
It's my conscience that stops me.
Do you think I am not sad?
Traditions matter more than ourconscience.
"Go ahead, hide in the barn, cover your head."
I told you when he was a little boy to get rid of the Zenne then.
You paid no heed.
God forgive us forwhat we've done or are about to do.
I can not act until I have concrete proof.
"We believe in the same God, Kezban."
He will whisperto me.
I wish you'd stay.
"When mom gives orders, you have to obey..."
"You are still in college, are they sick orwhat?"
Bankruptcy!
He's broke.
They can't afford to support both of us.
I fucked up yourlife as well.
Never mind.
I'll pay forthat too.
You take care of yourself.
"Murat, I need yourhelp."
I am pregnant...
I want this child but not marriage.
If we get to the point...
Sis?
What did you wanna tell me before?
Doesn't matter now.
- It just happened.
- Leave me alone.
You're not mad at me because of that.
Just like I'm not mad at you about Vanessa.
Stop telling me what I feel.
We're just doing what we always do.
Finding excuses.
"Well, I won't do it anymore."
- You told Serena you love me.
- Serena heard wrong.
"Last year, you told Nate."
"This year, you told Serena."
You tell everyone but me.
Why can't you tell me?
Is Gossip Girl right about you being a coward?
That's not true and you know it.
Gossip Girl can be right about you all she wants.
But I won't let her be right about me.
I will not be weak anymore.
You can't run.
You have to stay here and hear it this time.
"Chuck Bass, I love you."
"I love you so much, it consumes me."
I love you.
And I know you love me too.
Tell me you love me.
"That everything we've done, all the gossip and the lies, and the hurt will have been for something."
Tell me it was for something.
Maybe it was.
But it's not anymore.
Something really boring happened to someone ugly in the Middle Ages.
"Oh, thank you."
I'll see you guys later.
That is one lucky to-go cup of coffee.
I wish you would get over her.
I hate seeing you like this.
Is there anything I can do for you?
Do you wanna look down my top?
Thanks.
Maybe later.
"-Gunther, can I get a scone?"
-Want anything?
I want a lot of things.
I wanna be with the woman I love on Valentine's Day.
I want her to love me back.
And I want relief from the wrenching pain of knowing that won't happen!
We have red bagels.
Okay.
So how do you guys like living together so far?
"-Oh, it's been good."
-Yeah.
Except Ross is more uptight about crumbs than you are.
There was a drumstick in the couch.
And I am not uptight about crumbs.
"It's just that, you know.."
crumbs attract mice.
And mice leave droppings.
And that's how the plague started.
So you wanna relive that again..
Mice didn't start the plague.
Rats did.
"Rattus norvegicus, to be exact."
He said it was better if I didn't know.
Because of the danger.
"Look, I didn't give him the money."
I loaned it to him.
So you drew up a legal document?
No.
But we had an oral agreement.
"I mean, he promised to pay me back."
With interest.
"I mean, I maxed out all of my cards, so you better find that money."
What was he like the last time you saw him?
He was sweet.
We made love right before he left.
He use a condom?
I'm on the pill.
We were engaged.
"Abs, can DNA still be recovered from Lance Corporal Finn's skivvies?"
It would take the cooperation of weather and protection.
He was wrapped in plastic and it's been cold
", so there's a decent chance."
"Well, run the tests."
We'll do a cheek swab on his fiancées.
"Wait, did you say ""fiancées?"""
Like plural?
Huh.
Kinky.
Is that it?
"For now, Siri."
I need to follow you home and pick up his belongings.
I want them back when James returns.
He's dead.
He can't return.

Whoo!
I make at least two junk connections... at that far table over there in the corner.
- Right?
- [No Audible Dialogue]
And the guy in the striped shirt and tie combo...
I know him too.
I thought we came here to buy me a drink.
Who is that clown?
He's a policy guy from Queens.
Right.

Then we'll meet up and talk about it.
Otherwise we talk and talk and nothing ever happens.
That's why we have to take the initiative ourselves.
"Those who want to join, come with me to the entrance..."
The others can think about it.
"If a few came, I'd be happy."
Who here has a camera or a cell phone?
...
Stop...
Two steps to the right...
- Sit down!
Open your eyes!
They're for you.
They're pretty.
What do they eat... water?
You have to feed them.
I have to feed them?
We'll feed them.
They'll definitely die.
They'll last a little while.
So...
What's up?
How's it going with your marketing assistant?
What do you want?
Did you tell her your idea for a Christian community center?
Have a seat!
You know someone who can sing... female... pretty.
You mean Nora.
"You won't get Nora, she belongs to the hotel."
Make me a beer Angie!
"Well, that takes a while."
Then take your time!
- You're giving me a ride.
I don't know what happened.
I don't know why it burned down.
What was he even doing there?
Why didn't you tell us?
He didn't want to go to a foster home.
"He didn't want to leave, and I didn't want him to leave either."
"It's like, you force me to live amongst these pod people and the first cool person I meet, you kick him out of the house."
I did the best I could.
So did I.
Come on.
The police want to ask us some more questions.
"Dispatch, is there a description...?"
Thank you.
Just follow my lead.
You and I need to talk.
And this time I want the truth.
- I'm sorry.
- Ryan Atwood?
We got some questions for you.
- It was an accident.
"- Yeah, you were there?"
Yeah.
Then we got some questions for you too.
"Officer, I'm Mr. Atwood's attorney."
Please don't ask him any questions unless I'm present.
"Ryan, keep your mouth shut."
You too.
"Dad, I know."
I understand how important the model home is to the new development.
"We'll sell the lots by Christmas, I promise."
"No, hey, so you're a little on edge."
A giant glass spear in the back will do that to a guy.
It's not a spear.
"What is it, more of a spike or a skewer ?"
"Dude, you're doing a terrible job of trying to keep my mind off the pain."
"You're supposed to talk about something else, not the thing causing the pain."
"True, but the real question is, what are you doing to keep my mind off of your pain ?"
'Cause right now you're not looking too good and I'm starting to feel...
What was that ?
"Uh, seems like we hit something."
"Oh, God, not a body."
"All right, well, pull over or something."
"All right, go out and check,"
I guess.
With the zombies ?

You guys are amazing.
"Uh, no."
We're not.
No.
It's just something we do.
I used to sing that to Kaitlin when she was little and scared.
Sometimes.
"Yeah, you get to move around, change of scenery, meet new people."
Well...
I never thought of it that way.
You seem like a real people person.
Oh.
Outgoing.
Not like me.
No?
Thanks.
I bet you're really good at it.
"Well, there's only one way to find out."
"Boy, am I glad to hear you say that... because it's the one subject he's having trouble with."
You think you could fit him in?
"""Him?"""
Frank.
Frank?
Are you kidding?
At his age?
"Well, I'm afraid if he doesn't learn it now, he's never going to."
"You know, I would teach him myself, but I'm way out of practice."
Ah!
Oh.
Um...
"You know, you should never have to practice."
"Well, that's easy for you to say."
You're a professional.
"But for us laymen, if you don't use it, you lose it."
"Well, how long has it been, you know, since you... used it?"
Oh...
"I use it a little bit every day, you know-- the bank, the grocery store-- but it, you know..."
"It's probably been a good ten, 15 years since I was any good at it, you know."
"A double espresso, and make it quick!"
I'm just about done with the glasses.
Did I ask her if she's done with anything?
No.
Why would she inform me then?
That's just her way.
This way of hers is starting to get on my nerves!
You must be Max.
I've got the 503 for you.
503.
- I don't need a room.
This is a beautiful room.
You don't have to sign anything.
Everything is for free.
It's very intimate here.
You're among friends.
What should I do with them?
Did you sleep well?
Your keys please.
Hand them over!
I'll hang them up  until you come back.
That's how it's done in hotels.
My name is Tom.
You can call me Tom.
Campaign of solidarity...
Give me the keys!
There's breakfast upstairs in the cafeteria.
I'd have a problem just simply asking...
I just couldn't come out...
- That's why I have this 10 Euro bill for you.
"- I found it, and would like to give it you, because you need money..."
That way we can approach one another  for both my sake and yours.
What you're telling me is true?
Yes.
And you said the shaman told you this.
"From their perspective, a ghost is the spirit of a dead man."
But that man is alive.
"I've heard about this man, too."
Rumor has it he's a renowned professor.
"And there are darker, more disturbing rumors-"
Some say he's a Buddhist monk.
But they're just rumors.
How can you believe them?
"No, Father."
They're definitely not rumors.
You sound terribly sure.
Did you see it with your own eyes?
How can you be sure without seeing for yourself?
Take her back to the hospital.
Trust the doctor.
There's nothing the Church can do for you now.
Come with me to the Jap's.
Sorry?
I gotta see for myself if he's really a ghost or not.
"If he is, then I won't be able to kill him."
Where is he?
Is everyone here?
Yeah.
Why'd you call us so early?
Cheol-yeong couldn't come.
His sow is farrowing.
What's with your face?
This ain't a joke?
"You're serious, right?"
- No more fruit.
"- You live with these people, Jess?"
Seriously?
Stay here until you find a better place to live.
"I don't like you, stretch."
I don't like anything about you.
- And I'm not afraid to...
- I got this.
"I've got a place to live, Spence."
It's over.
I spent six years trying to figure you out.
All you are is a guy with really beautiful hair.
I'm happy you cheated on me.
"Thank you, because if you hadn't, I would have married you."
And then you would have hurt me all over again.
"And, yeah, I was scared to start over."
I didn't know what to do.
"And, yeah, I'm living with three guys I met on the Internet."
"And, yeah, stranger danger is real."
But I love these guys.
"I barely know them, I just met him, but I love them."
I would just take it easy with the love stuff.
All of them.
"Give her the shirt back, man."
- What happens if I say no?
- You know what happens?
Schmidt happens.
- Aah!
What was on your hand?
"- Thumb ring, bitch!"
You got some Schmidt on your face.
You know what?
- I'm in a hurry.
Could you...
Don't worry.
Have you there in a couple of minutes.
Listen.
Feel the power in this cab?
It has lots of power.
"You know, everybody tells me, I ought to be a race driver."
What do you think?
"Well, I think you're wrong."
"Don't worry about nothing, sir."
I'm a very safe driver.
Want me to tell you how safe?
I'll tell you anyway.
I've been driving a hack for 19 years and 11 months.
"And in all that time, I never even put one scratch on a cab."
"In fact, next month, they're gonna give me a gold safety award."
What do you think of that?
"Boy, you don't like nothing."
I sure hope you're a good tipper.
I knew there was something about you that didn't look right.
Hey!
You owe me a fare!
"- Officer, that goat's a guy."
- The goat?
The guy became a goat when I'm driving.
The guy?
This magician beat me out of this fare.
The magician?
- My perfect record.
- Record?
Oh... record.
- Good bye.
Hello.
Who was he?
The Tomaji parson lord.
Do you know it?
Sure.
It is can not to entrust it in nobody.
I have the pistol there always under my pillow.
"Shoot it if he is putting in his foot here once more, my Mariska"
"Well of course, major lord."
As if I would be exchanged kind Tót family.
I slept very well.
"Although I had bad dreams, but like that, as if I would be exchanged."
"We are very happy, major lord."
And this the air.
This silence.
This place is sound-proof.
Than the black velvet.
A guest of ours said it about him.
Yeah!
It is this punctually!
Than the black velvet.
Lõrinc lord's state a unfortunate railway reverse gear caused.
"Calm down, major lord!"
- You Sándor.
What you knock here?
- What should I do Lajos?
It is itching.
This rotten plaster is since 4 weeks on me.
"Than the malady, is itching so."
Well go then into the house or behind the house.
My own garden not i can do what I want?
How did you get here so soon?
Hannah!
I just left from the broker's office.
My driver knows all the shortcuts in New York.
I must say I didn't expect you that soon.
Neither did your secretary.
"Stephanie, dear, you may leave now."
The stock is up to eight and three eighths.
I've made $120.000 so far.
Good for you.
You need me.
Maybe you need me even more.
Is that your husband?
Yes.
Was that painted before or after he died?
Six months he sat for that.
Maybe that's what killed him.
You are a wicked man.
"Tell me, where did you learn the market so thoroughly?"
I studied in Europe.
How would you like to make $12.000 cash immediately?
I would love to.
What do I have to do for it?
Just write me a check for $20.000.
Do you really think I'm an idiot?
"Look, I will sell you four thousand shares of Wentworth Drug at $5 a share."
The stock is selling at 8 dollars.
You make three points.
That's roughly $3.000 less commission.
It's a gift.
Why will you do that?
Well... let's say it's because you appeal to me.
- My shame?
- Glitter.
- Ohh.
Tell me what happened.
"We picked up my graduation stuff on the way, and..."
I don't know.
I guess the tassel got my dad thinking.
Why didn't you leave them in the car?
I didn't want them to get stolen.
"And I may have taken it out to impress a certain Chyna with a ""Y."""
I think she really liked me.
I'm not gonna spoil that one for ya.
I graduate in five hours!
We'll get you another cap and gown.
That sash has been worn by every honoree for decades.
I'm not gonna be the one to lose it after it's survived earthquakes and wars and the lunchroom gravy fire of '64!
Fine.
Where is this place?
I don't know!
I remember there was a lot of brass and mirrors and loud '80s music.
"Well, that narrows it down."
Wait.
"Uh, it was by the airport."
All right.
We'll find it.
I'll take you.
Don't worry.
It'll be our little secret.
"Thank you, Jay."
(sighs)
What happened to him?
I'm back.
It's true.
The doctor declared him dead.
Yes.
He was put on the bed.
We didn't touch him.
"You may have kept your key, but the prisoner found another one."
The key to freedom.
It's extraordinary!
He could not crawl through the bars!
Chief.
"This man, was he dead, yes or no?"
"Mr Judge, to be dead is to be dead, and he was dead."
He lives.
He lives.
A boy is arrested for murder.
But he is innocent.
"Then he hangs himself, dies, and escapes from jail without being seen."
"If we don't double our readership with that, I will be hanged!"
Hold your horses!
One hanging man is enough.
One of two things:
"Either Jacques Dollon was not dead and he went out alone, or he was dead and someone took him out."
"Anyway, we must know how the escape took place."
An inexplicable mystery is worthy only of one man.
I'm sure of it now.
"He returns, unlike what I said earlier."
Fantômas?
Yes.
"I have to take the case, if only to avenge Juve."
What are you going to do?
Blood.
Get lost!
"Oh, did you see?"
"Oh, there's a little lizard."
Quite a big lizard.
What kind?
That was a water monitor.
"Water monitor, that sounds like a job at school."
"It does, actually."
"Today, you'll be water monitor."
That was quite big.It's a slightly weaker version of a milk monitor.
"Oh, careful, careful.Oh, my God!"
"Oh, my..."
That's a sea snake?
"Look at that, that's a good size one, isn't it?"
Yep.You're not going to handle it?
"Oh, my God, you are."
Careful.
"Oh, my goodness!"
You are very brave!
Mark told me this is possibly the second most venomous snake in the world.Yep.
"God, look at that."
Gorgeous markings.
I was just going to say.
"Because it's also called the banded sea krait, you can see why - all those dark bands across the body."
"What's amazing about it is that it spends most of its time out at sea, out in the ocean."
It can dive and hold its breath for up to 2 hours.
Yes.Good Lord.They'll come on land for mating also.
And lays the eggs.
"Is this a female, this one?"
Yeah.
Normally the female is bigger than the male.Right.
"OK, so I'm going to release it."
We should release it.
And the dog.
"Richard, I want you to do something for me."
Get a hold of the kennel association.
See if you can trace that dog's background.
"Otis, trace a dog?"
"Well, they told me that, working with you,"
I'd learn something every day.
"Look, you can get the dog's registration number"
From the girl.
I want to know everything possible.
"You know, uh, name of the breeder, place of birth..."
All that sort of stuff.
OK.
And don't make a big deal out of it
"Now, especially with the girl."
Audrey dear.
It's Hester.
"I know, dear."
Another senseless tragedy.
"No, no, no, there's nothing you can do about it."
Just leave it to the police.
Yes.
I'll tell you why I called.
I've called the vet.
"Yes, I'm going to take Greta to get her shots."
"No, I'd be glad to do it."
"It'll give you a chance to rest, dear."
"Oh, yes."
"And, uh, by the way, um, you know that tag, that other tag"
That Greta's wearing?
"Well, I know it sounds silly."
"But, uh, I'd like her to keep it."
"She won't just be my victim,"
"She'll be his victim, too."
"Pretty good, right?"
"That'll kill him, won't it?"
Good man like devalos.
Respected man.
No way he'll be able to live with himself
If he let's that happen.
"I know who you are, you know."
Pardon me?
I know you're a prince.
I know about the problem.
"I know about the money, and I want to help you."
I've got a little more than $38 saved up.
"But I know it's not much, but it's what I've got."
And when you get all that money
"That you've been writing to people about,"
You can pay me back.
I just want enough
To cover my library debt: $92.18.
"I think you are mistaken, little girl."
You've got me mixed up with somebody.
You don't have to pretend with me.
"I know you're a prince, okay?"
I've read the e-mails.
"And I know that you have enemies everywhere,"
But I'm not one of them.
"And look, even if you don't get all your money back,"
I want you to have this.
"I'm sorry, young lady, but you've got me mixed up."
I must get going.
"No, you can't just not take my money"
"Come on, Marcus, you wally!"
Wait!
Wait!
Excuse me.
What is going on here?
Nothing.
Everything's under control.
I'm just his voice coach.
What are you doing here?
"I heard you were about to commit social suicide, so I dropped by."
- My accompanist left!
- Brilliant.
- You don't have to do it.
- I can't do that.
"Yeah, you can."
Just tell them:
Artistic differences.
You can't work without him.
He had a drug problem.
My mum wants me to sing it.
It'll make her happy.
"Look, mate, nothing you do can make your mum happy, all right?"
Not in the long term.
She has to do that for herself.
- Get over here right now!
"- Just bugger off, will you!"
"What I'm saying is, the important thing is to make yourself feel happy."
I've tried just making myself happy.
She's tried making herself happy.
It doesn't work.
You need other people to make you happy.
But that's just it.
We've got to get into that room.
A room that's losing evidence as we speak.
I know.
"It's just, I thought coming back to D.C."
Would feel like old home week or something.
- Home is overrated.
- God.
"- Uncool, Artie."
- What are you doing here?
"- Uncool, Artie."
- What is he doing?
I had a hunch about something
From Pete's description and I just need to see this with my own eyes.
You two have a plan to get in there?
Yeah.
We're gonna crawl under the motion sensors--
Yes.
There's an access panel on the roof.
"We can go in through the-- well, please, ladies first."
No.
"You know what, you--you be the smart one this time."
"Okay, get this,"
There's an access panel on the roof.
It'll bring us in right above the main wiring
For the security system.
"Now, if we crawl on our bellies, we can avoid the motion sensors."
"And what do you mean ""this time""?"
All right.
I get the idea.
"If I may, put these on."
Really.
Or you'll be of no use to me.
These are some numbers i'm thinking of playing.
"No, Malcolm, don't worry."
Nobody's gonna steal your numbers.
You'd be a fool not to.
These six numbers aren't just chosen at random.
"They're my own algorithm based on probability, emerging number patterns the theories of sir Isaac Newton."
Isaac Newton.
Really?
There's just six numbers.
You only buy one ticket a week?
That's all I need.
How many do you buy?
"Well, it depends."
20.
You're just shotgunning it?
Rookie move.
"Well, how much have you won?"
How much ever or how much this year?
Let's say ever.
Zero.
- It's not just about winning or losing.
- It's the lottery!
It's all about winning.
What else is there?
"The journey, Captain!"
It's how you get there.
I'd rather lose my way then win a $20 million jackpot your way.
Okay.
I think we're through here.
"You think you're pretty clever, don't you, Mr. Lottery expert?"
I've got news for you.
We've got your number.
"We're going for the Lincoln, OK?"
"Ok, we go for the Lincoln."
"Ok, we go for the Lincoln."
Wait a second.
What's happening?
In the car.
They're in the car.
In the car.
They're in the car.
Shoot em!
Aahhh.
Hang on.
"Luckily, the bullet passed right through."
Just missed a major artery though.
And he still lost a lot of blood.
Is he going to be all right?
What do you want a warranty?
"No, I want him checking out on me."
"No, I want him checking out on me."
You should have thought about that before you brought him here.
But this guy seems pretty tough though.
He'll probably pull through all right.
Man.
That's the biggest god-damn tattoo I've ever seen.
What the hell are you doing?
Jesus.
"Guy certainly isn't afraid of needles, huh?"
How long till he comes to?
You got me.
This stuff is supposed to keep him calmed down but I'm not sure for how long.
This stuff is supposed to keep him calmed down but I'm not sure for how long.
I haven't gotten into anesthetics yet you know.
"And fix the bogs, and oil that very squeaky door."
And lower the price of grain.
"Er...yeah, maybe."
I mean -
"People are starving, Marcus."
I haven't eaten bread for weeks.
I thought you were on a wheat-free diet?
"Not by choice, dickhead."
I can't afford it.
"The grain companies are fucking us in the arse, and expecting us to swallow it."
"Yeah, that does sound bad."
"It's a disgrace, and a little more urgent than a squeaky door."
You haven't heard it.
It's like...
Eee-whoo-whaaargh...
"But, yeah, ending starvation."
I'll add that to the list.
"Salve, Grumio."
"All right, landlord."
Obvious question - why are you licking a bag?
"Oh, yeah, I got in a load of posh nosh last night."
The bag's still got salami juice on it.
"Lovely, lovely."
Do you fancy a dab?
"No, I'll leave it for now, thanks."
"Oh, no, I've still got Rambo's card."
"Oh, yes!"
I've still got Rambo's chuffing card!
"Yep, my master will like that."
"Your master must be quite the foodie, sir."
"Oh, he's one of the foodiest fellas you'll ever meet."
"What else is good here, then?"
I thought I was getting pinched over here.
He's hangin' on my fuckin' neck like a vulture.
Like impending danger.
What do you want?
This guys worried.
He didn't want to come over with the check.
Could you take care of this?
No problem.
Tell him to put it on my tab.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
It ain't just this one.
It's seven big ones you owe me.
"$7,000, that ain't peanuts."
"I don't mean to be out of order-- lt's good you don't like to be out of order, Sonny."
"Embarrassing me in front of my friends, callin' me a fuckin' deadbeat."
"Ya know Sonny, you're a real fuckin' mutt."
You know the money we spend in this fucking--
-Don't be like that.
-Like what?
Do you believe this prick?
"You think this is funny, eh?"
What the fuck are you looking at?
You fuckin' moron!
You don't want to bring the check?
Do you believe this prick?
"You're supposed to be doing this stuff, too, ya know?"
You're a funny guy.
"That's it, Henry!"
You want to laugh?
This prick last week asked me to christen his kid.
"I charged him $7,000."
You really are a funny guy.
What's this?
These are some numbers I'm thinking of playing.
"Oh, no, no."
"Malcolm, don't worry."
Nobody's going to steal your numbers.
"Well, you'd be a fool not to."
These six numbers aren't just chosen at random.

"Well, I've got news for you."
Yes.
Okay?
There he is.
I'm coming to get you!
Reserve a special cell for me.
I'll be right back after stabbing him!
Poor husband.
Can one man be the reason for destroying another?
The curse of husbands will not spare you.
Be careful.
- It's okay.
Is the inspector's phone ready?
It is ready.
- Give it.
Do you know the old actor 'Bagavathar'?
Yes.
- This is belongs his era.
Why is he still using it?
May be he has his sentiments about it.
We can fix that then.
"I'll fix wifi, bluetooth, and all features in this."
Why would you do that!
So he can track all my activities and be a pain?
Give me the phone.
Get the money from him.
"If the phone conks off again, take it to the museum."
Please don't bring it to my shop.
I'll pass the message to the inspector.
"Panju, if the victim was an outsider,"
He should have stayed in a hotel or at a lodge.
Why don't we enquire there.
I now know why we seem to set well together.
‐ You could.
You won't.
Because then it's over.
It's all over.
It's all over.
‐ How do you do it?
"How do you live with yourself, Cal?"
"I mean, the truth."
And not what you preach.
Because I'm having a really hard time.
‐ It's hell.
Um...
"It's a living, waking hell."
"I'm never without regret, much as it goes against everything we teach."
Much as it goes against everything we teach.
Um...
"It's‐‐just always, always with me."
"All I can do is‐‐ is try to make up for it, but I..."
"That's why this place,"
I didn't want to let it go b‐‐
Come here.
I want to show you.
"Source of Light, we turn to you."
We turn to you.
Help us to purify our spirits.
"Forever bound to one another in Light, a circle of communion."
Let the bonding of these hands be a symbol for the bond they have to each other.
Steer us from the darkness.
Free us from earthly cares.
Fill our hearts with love.
And help us become...
A perfect vessel of your Truth.
"- And to be honest, I got scared, so..."
- Have you checked your desk?
He didn't give me anything.
I swear he just came here to talk.
This was my father's.
I've never seen it before.
- Why were you hiding it from me?
"- If I knew it was yours,"
- I wouldn't keep it from you.
- Why would he even give it to you?
Do you know what this key is for?
Lionel wasn't in his right mind when he was here.
I don't know why he left that.
You're fired.
Escort miss Sullivan from the building.
Aren't you gonna give me a second to clear out my private things?
Your personal items will be boxed up and sent to your home.
"Your name may be on the building, but that's my personal stuff."
I got rights!
"If anything is missing, I swear to god, you won't hear the end of it!"
I'll pack up miss Sullivan's belongings.
You go back to the mansion.
Get some sleep.
"We did it, Lex."
Lionel not suicide.
Have Pic.
Come to archive room.
Jimmy.
That's it.
I'm leaving.
"I want to start working on this picture, but we haven't heard from Chloe yet."
I really think that we should wait.
If this hadn't happened I'd never discover what a sap I am.
"Oh, yes, you would."
- I would have told you.
"- Yes, I suppose so."
"We won't have to put up with each other any longer, will we?"
- Yes.
- I was afraid of that.
Now let's see.
"No house, no show, no prospects."
Don't I get anything out of this?
[clears throat]
Might just as well smoke a doormat.
"You don't happen to have a new cigar about you, do you, Tyler?"
"I'll, uh..."
"I'll walk out and get you one, Commodore."
"- Uh, no, no, no, don't go."
- 'It's alright.'
I feel the need of a short walk anyway.
- I don't want to trouble you.
- No trouble at all.
Doug.
Yes.
"You know, this is only the beginning of all."
"Patricia, it was hardly my fault."
No one could have foreseen that Ganz and Grady would...
But you didn't know those men.
You did it for what you get out of it.
With his interest at heart.
I felt it provided an opportunity for him.
I really did.
"You have my word, dear."
Your word.
"You know what, I'm stuck."
I have to shave this down.
You don't have to go the extra mile.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
What happened to the days when you used to listen to me?
That was a long time ago.
You should listen to me.
Not in this lifetime.
"Listen, Newbie, you're not a completely, terribly, horrible, incompetent doctor."
"While I would never let any blood relatives be your patient, if it was someone that I knew, an acquaintance,"
I might be OK with you treating them.
Thank you.
The only thing you owe Carol is to treat her the best you can.
"Hey, where you been?"
"Oh, Larry, man."
I don't think I can shave my head.
What about Carol?
She'll be OK.
She has all you guys.
- You look over there.
- Mm-hm.
"Excuse me, nurse."
Hi!
How 'bout a poke?
"I have a husband, OK?"
And he's big and he's black and...
"Baby, baby, it's me!"
But I do love that you go to that big and black stuff.
I can't wait to bear the fruit of your loins.
"Baby, wait!"
This is the only way I can suck up to Kelso without the surgeons knowing.
There you are.
"I asked her if it was possible if we could be together when she gets back, and she said, ""You never know."""
She said that?
I'm gonna kill her.
"Don't tell Riley, but I'm looking into a transfer."
I have friends at Cairo Presbyterian.
Dr. Lonsdale.
Dr. Habib.
Perfect.
Ooh!
"You said you were going to do it, Riley."
You promised you would leave the guy no hope!
What are you talking about?
I dumped him this morning.
I can't help it if the guy doesn't want to let me go.
You were supposed to close the door!
"Instead, you did what you always do."
You left it wide open.
I don't know if I left it wide open.
Maybe I left it open a tiny little crack.
A crack is just as bad!
Why couldn't you just close it?
"I mean, what is so hard about closing the door on a relationship you don't even want?"
I don't know.
I guess maybe it scares me.
Something scares you?
"Okay, look, it's really hard for me to talk about feelings, so if we are gonna talk about this, you have to make a dumb face."
What?
!
Just do it.
Oh.
Mm.
Oh!
So I could get in no problem?
Well assuming you had Miley's grades and SAT scores.
"Wait, wait, wait, wait."
I am very tired here so I need to get this clear.
This may sound crazy.
Let me get this right.
If Miley and I were somehow I don't know.
"Smooshed into the same person, we could get in?"
[Laughs] Well if you put it like that I guess you would.
Unfortunately that's not the case.
Although oddly enough You do have the same eye twitch.
That's not the only thing we have in common.
It just so happens that Miley and I are.
The same.
Sign of the zodiac.
"Sagittarius, which means we're the fire sign."
And over-excitable eyelids.
I gotta go.
[Door closes]
"[Singing to the tune of ""Singing""]"
Problems.
She's got nothing but problems.
She's lost Jesse and Lilly.
All because of the wig.
If she came clean.
All her problems would just go away.
Or would they just begin?
[Mimicking cats screeching]
She's going to be home any minute.
And I don't know what to say to make her feel better.
"I know, I know."
It's terrible.
"Wait, wait, wait, wait."
Do you know how they died?
Maybe.
If you tell me why you're so interested.
"It's him, isn't it?"
What?
Who?
Him who?
"The test didn't work, but it's still him."
It's Jackson.
What do you think you're doing?
The hour's up.
You're not leaving till every single one of these bubbles is filled in.
I thought you wanted to talk.
I...
I...
I changed my mind.
You sure?
Because you look a little stressed.
Is it Scott?
Is it that whole thing?
I still can't believe you actually think your little Romeo and Juliet story is gonna last.
You know he's eventually just gonna run to Derek and join up with him and his little wolf pack.
"If you don't realize that, then you gotta be the stupidest bitch in this town."
"Well, other than Scott since he's a pretty stupid bitch himself."
Stop it.
Just stop!
"What are you gonna do, Allison?"
When your stupid bitch of a boyfriend turns on you?
They killed your aunt.
They almost killed Lydia.
Who do you really think is gonna be next?
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
"When you get to the strip club, instead of going inside, just bang your head against the wall outside, take the money out of your pocket, and light it on fire."
"You'll still wake up in the morning with a raging headache, your dick in your hand, and no money, but at least you won't be late for work."
See you.
We're going to be late for work tomorrow.
"Yeah, that's what I figured."
"- Bye, asshole."
"- See you, douchebag."
"King of the douchebags, ok."
My title deserves a little respect.
"Yeah, whatever."
You all set?
I ain't gonna go to scores.
You want me to stay?
"No, no, I'm good."
You sure?
You're gonna be by yourself in a room full of booze.
"Yeah, I'm good."
- You sure?
- I'm your sponsor.
"Come on, i know what I'm talking about."
"Yeah, but bottom line, tommy, we're both just a couple of drunks."
"Yeah, but I'm a higher ranking drunk than you, so if A.A.Was like an army, I'd be a 5-star general, and you're just a grunt."
Take it as an order.
I'm fine.
Get out of here.
"- Yes, sir."
- All right.Bye.
Rescue Me Season 5 Episode 08
I love you.
I always loved you.
Director Kim.
The character who resembles me.
What is she like?
"- Well, she's rather simple."
- Just curious...
And honest.
"But she only sees as much as she can, so she's not that honest."
"Just simple and a bit abstract, which really doesn't suit her."
She easily falls for what others say.
"As well as for authority or success, that kind of thing."
I'm like that?
"No, she's just a character that I'm thinking of."
So that's what she's like.
I'd like to meet you occasionally and have nice conversations.
"Sure, let's do that."
"We drank too much, huh?"
I'm sorry.
I saw you a few days ago.
Sorry?
You were running around with a man and a woman chasing you.
- How did you see that?
- We were walking by.
I see.
- Yeah.
- Where are you?
Director Kim asked me to join him for some sushi.
The food is delicious.
Really?
Why'd you go alone without telling me?
He called right after you left.
"Oh, I was just leaving."
Don't worry.
- I don't think that's an actual thing.
- I don't care.
- Special occasion?
"- Yeah, it's girls' night out."
In a pub?
This pub?
"Safer if Bo's with her own kind so start us a tab, Trickster."
- One drink.
- Maybe two.
- Okay.
"That's right, champ."
Look at that.
"Not only is he dodging charges, he's gonna sue our ass."
- Never gonna happen.
Just talk.
- Yeah?
You can deduce that?
"Interesting, you haven't been deducing shit this past while."
"- Is there a problem, ma'am?"
- You.
You are a problem.
- This is your third complaint.
- Nothing new.
-It's just suspects stirring up shit.
"- No, you're losing control and it's getting in the way."
- I'll try harder.
Better than that.
"You'll report to the shrink and get shrunk, or I am chaining you to this desk."
Well done.
Now you gonna tell me what the hell's going on?
"Come on, this is lame you leaving me out."
"Man, I got the cops, and I got the Fae."
"- No, I'm not going."
Sometimes you're a bit complicated.
"Go alone, I'm not going."
Shut the door.
"If you stay out late, I'll lock it."
You're sitting there with your golden kerchiefs... and your bald heads that signal that you're the bosses.
Your activities will be evident at the court...
You eat up all the public rights...
The police will catch you all.
- You're getting on our nerves!
- So what?
"Mec, get back to your place!"
Let me go!
Have you gone mad?
I haven't seen your money!
Let him go!
A drunkard won't humiliate me!
The bottle holds the wine.
Why can't you?
"Go and let off steam over there, not here!"
Calm down!
"He's not drunk, he's just insolent."
What's wrong with you?
You're bothering us.
Incredible!
Scandalous!
Let's settle the bill!
- Let's go home.
- No!
- I'll walk you...
"- No, I'm staying."
You don't look good.
"They knew I was his girlfriend, and if I saw him, they wanted me to give him some money... a check for a couple of thousand they said he loaned them."
"Well, I returned it, naturally."
Naturally.
I'm scared of those guys.
"They want to hurt Roger, and I don't know why."
We gotta find him first.
So you made up... the whole story about the gold teeth... to find them while we were looking for Roger.
Do you have a photograph of him?
"Oh, in... in my bag."
You lied to me about that!
You said you didn't have one!
I know.
Hmm.
Fine figure of a man.
"Honolulu's a big place, Thomas."
I'll check it out and see what I can turn up.
"Come on, T.C. just one beer."
You're in training.
I'm not going to have my contestant... barfing his guts all over the race from guzzling beer.
Okay.
Okay.
Have it your way.
Just because I thought it would help me forget how... sore my shoulder really is.
Aw.
"Well, Beauty Knows No Pain."
And I should know.
Cut that out!
"- You really believe everything she's telling you about Roger, huh?"
- Yeah.
Sure.
"Well, 65% I believe."
"Hey, what about that, uh, government guy in the sedan?"
(SNORTING)
Why don't you put some clothes on?
(SNORTING)
I told you to put some clothes on.
"Ray, you know those people are dead."
Those people are dead.
No shit.
And you were there.
Don't forget that.
"I told you to put some goddamned clothes on, didn't I?"
RAY:
"You know, we got enough of this shit to last us till 1995."
We got enough to last us till we get to Houston.
We're not selling all this shit.
We're selling it to Billy in Houston.
"I'm going back to Chicago, man."
I don't give a fuck what you do.
PLUTO:
It don't make no sense riding up and down a road.
RAY:
What the hell you think is going to happen?
We're going to get in trouble?
"Besides, I was planning on selling some to them country sons of bitches in Arkansas."
I don't like this Arkansas shit.
We're going to be in and out.
We're not building a goddamn house.
"It's not a problem, Pluto."
What you worried about?
What the fuck do you think?
"I don't get you, baby."
Why don't you loosen up and have some fun?
Why don't you get high with Ray and me?
"Nah, you should frame it, or take it to one of those places where they encase stuff in plastic."
I'm a key employee.
Gaming Commission says key employees... aren't allowed to wager at the casino that employs them.
This was given to you by somebody who was repaying a debt.
But they're gonna have me on video cashing the thing in.
That doesn't look good.
"No, no, no."
"Hey, man, you want to make a little money?"
Yeah.
"Cash this in for me, I'll give you 10%."
That's 200 bucks.
"There's a catch, right?"
No catch.
He's just lazy.
'Cause he's lazy.
"That's hard, man."
Right.
Two thousand bucks.
How 'bout that?
"So, how are things going?"
I was gonna head over to my dad's and start clearing the place out.
"Ah, good move."
Mary's gonna go with me.
Ah.
It's easier to go in with someone else.
"- Yeah, I hear ya."
"- Hey, guys."
"I know you didn't find anything on that guy that took my wallet, but here's the thing."
"I've been looking all day for a betting slip, and then I remembered it's in my wallet."
"It was a five-team parlay- Bucs, Rams, Seahawks, Chargers, Lions, for God's sake."
It's the first time in my life I got 'em all right.
"Ticket's worth $2,000."
He's under observation.
"What are you thinking, doctor?"
Sometimes I've a doubt...
"Will you please step out once, doctor?"
Give that to me.
How many times do I've to tell you?
You're a doctor and I'm the patient.
"Bloody, you..."
"You're a patient, I'm a doctor."
That's what I said.
How dare you manhandle me?
I will...
Take it.
How dare you beat me!
"Cerebellum is damaged, cerebrum is battered."
Totally his brain has busted.
You mean he can't remember the past?
Why not?
Didn't I get it on getting beaten up?
He can remember if anyone rakes up his past.
He can if he's beaten up day and night.
Are you feeling for him?
"He was mad after kick, so he lost his brain."
Now I'm peaceful.
No tension.
I thought he would come to disturb us.
"You don't want him but you want the gift he gave, right?"
She's much more clever than what I expected.
Why would you believe me?
But she doesn't know about me.
"If plan A fails, I've a plan B."
- Play the band!
"- You're crazy, you have an erection!"
- So?
Someone could come in.
I don't care-
"- Ricky, what is this?"
"Sorry, I can't control it."
I see you and I get a boner.
How can I talk to you when your thingie is pointing at me?
You don't have to look.
I won't have sex with you now.
Who asked you to?
And I'm not getting pregnant anymore.
Forget it.
Why do you have to punish yourself?
What are you guilty of?
- Did you ever count how many pregnancies I've lost?
- We've lost-
I don't remember you ever being pregnant.
"What is this, a suffering contest?"
You don't know what it's like to give birth to a dead child.
"Ricky, I'm not pretending."
I really don't want to adopt.
I don't want to be the one who poisons your soul.
You deserve Amuka.
You deserve sex in a sauna with a normal woman.
You deserve children.
I can't raise a child I'm not sure I'll be able to love.
What about me?
Please go home.
I'm not going.
Why don't you pick up?
- I thought it was...
You watched me pass out.
Doctor said the bullet you put in me missed my vital organs.
"Well, uh, lucky me."
"Because, uh, now I get to collect the money that you hid from me, Paul."
"Or, sorry, what are you calling yourself now?"
Craig?
Heh.
"You know, heh, I couldn't believe when I saw you on that game show."
I thought I was losing my mind.
"But there you were, in the flesh."
A second chance at getting what's mine.
"No, the money belonged to us."
"I figured you would double-cross me, so I moved it."
Smart boy.
"But, uh, you're not so smart right now."
You listen to me.
I know about that Swiss Bank account where you moved my money to.
Now here's what you're gonna do.
You're gonna go in that bank and you're gonna wire the money to yourself.
You're gonna get it out in cash.
You can't just walk into a bank and take out $4 million.
You just go in there and you get me what's mine.
All right.
Let's go.
- I said no cops.
- I didn't do anything.
"Go, go, go."
"Five-0 requesting back up, Pacific Rim Bank, shots fired."
Everybody out.
Are you the manager?
"Show me the back door, let's go."
"Chin, I see him."
I couldn't stop.
"I've never had that feeling before, like I couldn't move."
And then I guess itjust... took off..
"That may not make much sense, but it's... the only way I can put it into words."
"You didn't see it, did you?"
It started about two months ago.
Every time I answered the phone I'd hear it.
The first one was just a loud beeping noise.
Now they're mostly.
"These creaking, howling sounds."
They all like this?
"Well, once it was a man talking really fast."
What'd he say?
I couldn't make it out.
Some foreign language.
Have you had the line checked?
I even had our number changed.
But before I got a chance to give it out to anyone... the calls started again.
It's not a question of believing them.
"Like I said, they're honest people."
- How long you lived here?
- My whole life.
- I grew up right over that hill.
- On a farm?
"Shucks, no."
A real live house.
Indoor plumbing and everything.
Sorry.
We even had shoes for church and schooling' and stuff.
"All right, all right."
Where the hell are you?
I'm still here.
Why won't you give him the money?
"Why don't you just say, ""Byron, I'm your daddy""?"
I don't see how that would....
I guess it wouldn't be a good idea.
I guess it would be better just to put me in jail and forget about your five-year-old son.
"Hi, baby."
"Yeah, everything's cool."
Everything's real cool.
"Ray, where are you calling from?"
What's the name of the gas station?
"Ray, you missed the turnoff."
It's about half a mile back up the highway.
You turn right at this place called Cothern's Bait Shop.
There's a little road there.
"You're not far, baby."
Just about ten minutes away.
Hurry.
"Yeah, I miss you."
"Is that the road, Byron?"
-I don't think so.
-You don't think so?
"When they arrive, get them in the house and away from the car."
"Open the door, talk to them."
Let them see everything is okay.
Then stay in the kitchen until I say to come out.
"Then if they get trigger-happy, you'll be out of the line of fire."
Then you'll let me go?
I'll let you go.
Is that the road you took?
Don't go in there fucking around.
In and out.
You got me?
Very good...
What's your problem?
We made it.
"What's my problem is, It's almost dark."
We have no place to stay.
You figure out What my problem is.
We have the tent.
Everybody...
"Yeah, we have the tent!"
Have you set one up before?
!
"Yeah, so I've never Set one up before!"
"But it's a tent, And I can figure it out."
Everything's fine.
"We're not gonna freeze To death, everybody."
We work out in these Conditions all the time.
"I know, but we have a place To go to at the end of the day."
"Here, we don't."
"I have no idea, To be honest with you."
I believe my dad and brother Wanted me so we'd go back.
To the old way Of doing things.
"So I'm basically saying, ""Hey, you're gonna give up."""
"Everything you know, You're gonna come live with me."
"""In the middle of nowhere, And that's your new life."""
"If I can't make my family want To make a million dollars,"
I'll get somebody else.
"As night falls across The bering sea,"
Just one mile away...
Whoo!
Hell yeah!
Shawn pomrenke's first day Of the winter mining season.
Comes to a close.
It's the closest any of us actually ever came.
Yeah.
"Jamie wasn't really spawned by Satan, was he?"
No.
"If he was, we'd have a way better house."
"You're the one, Jamie."
Show me the way!
There's a lot of things I can handle.
A lot of things I've managed to survive.
I'd even say I've thrived where others would have just thrown in the towel.
"Yes, honey, you certainly have."
"Now relax, and let the bubbles do their work."
Soothing.
- Sooth...
"- Dad, we finish..."
I told you to stay the hell away from this bathroom until I said so!
This is a child-free zone until further notice!
Soothing... soothing...
"You know what, Hal?"
I'm done.
I give up.
What are you talking about?
Jamie wins.
He beat me.
"All those years, all those terrible things those kids have done."
"It doesn't make me stronger, it's just worn me down."
"Like termites eating away at a house, until all that's holding up is paint."
"I'm just paint, Hal."
Jamie knows it.
You'll do a better job than I can.
I trust you.
"No, no, no."
Thank you so much for being here.
Thank you for having me.
Are you ready to get out there and turn some laps?
I'm ready as I'll ever be.
Is that fair?
'Cause I know you like to drive fast on your own.
Yeah.
"I mean, in my own car, in the safety and dangerousness of real traffic."
We will see you in the hangar when you're done.
Good luck.
- Thank you.
- Lake Bell!
[ Cheers and applause ]
Let's get some air going here.
Wood:
"Now, the fastest lap time is 139.3, set by Stephen Moyer."
[ Engine revving ] Let's see how Lake can do.
And now to shift gears.
Looking good so far.
Little tap on the brakes.
Keep it serious.
Keep it really serious!
Good focus.
"Car looks composed so far, heading down in towards the teardrop."
[Bleep]
"Looking good, not super-fast through there."
And there's a thousand people there.
I hope I don't.
"Oh, my God."
That's a lot of people to be looking right at me as I...
don't shift.
But this is where people make up a lot of time.
"- l'm on your side, I swear."
I'm gonna tell you as soon as I can.
It's in the best interest of your case if we can cooperate.
I need to know what you're trying to do.
We're trying to do what we always try to do... put bad guys in jail.
including my ex-husband?
"I have no idea, and that's the truth."
And if I don't cooperate?
"Well, I'll get anxious and depressed, start offering you jobs down here or something or vacation property."
Just kidding.
"To tell you the truth, I don't know what I'd do if you don't cooperate."
[knock on door]
- Hey.
"- Hey, sweetie."
I'll be back down in a second.
She... she ate.
Good.
How much?
Enough.
So how's it going?
You're asking me that?
Sorry.
What?
- What what?
- l'm asking you.
"Well, I don't understand."
You're... you're asking me what?
I don't know what I'm asking you.
"Rick, we really can't talk about this."
"Karen, Karen, I know something's happening."
"If you know what it is, I think you have a responsibility to tell me."
Excuse me.
I thought I'd cover all the major food groups.
"So sorry about this, Rambo."
"It's cool, man, it's Dad's money."
He won't even notice.
You ever had mice?
"We have, but more as an infestation than a delicacy."
So is Daddy properly loaded?
"Er...yeah, I guess so."
"He owns, like, a shipping company and a sawmill thing and a marble..."
whatever it's called - hole?
Quarry?
Yeah!
And the grain company.
The grain company that we work for?
He owns that?
Yeah.
"Well, I actually own it now."
He kind of gave it to me.
Boom!
"Well done, Rambo."
"Well, sort of."
"I'd much rather be working at the shipping place, to be honest."
But I sort of burnt my boats there after the er...fire.
"So Dad moved me to grain, which is obviously super lame!"
But at least I met you guys.
Nice mice.
The spoilt brat has the whole company.
"When I was his age, I didn't even have pubes."
Really?
You said he was 16?
"Yeah, I was a late starter."
"The point is, this kid can force Flavia to get me a new chair."
We were horsing around.
"No, we weren't."
Ahem.
What do you want from this vortex deal?
My company is in debt for 2 million.
"I've borrowed against the house, and my equity line is under water."
So what do you need from the deal?
At least $2.5 million.
"I need 2 to take care of the debt, and that would leave me with $500,000 for Jeremy."
For Jeremy?
I have cancer.
I'm scheduled to go to the hospital at the end of the week.
I'd like this closed by then.
"Oh, God."
I'm...
"I'm sorry, Liz."
I-- melanoma.
They think it might be heading for my lymph nodes.
So what are they gonna do for it?
I'm gonna have surgery.
They're gonna cut it out.
"I'll do radiation and chemo, and that will be that."
"It's not a big deal, Burton."
"They'll operate, they'll take it out, and that will be that."
"Well, what about Jeremy, does he know about this?"
Not yet.
[Front door opens] When you gonna tell him?
Ready?
"Yeah, yeah."
"We'll talk tomorrow, ok?"
Yeah.
Good night.
This is who he hires?
What?
Are you kidding me?
This is the guy you want.
This is the guy I'd hire.
It's the guy you'd hire.
"Look, you remember Emilio?"
"Okay, this dude got Emilio off, like, twice."
Okay?
"Both times, they had him dead to rights, yo."
"And then, poof."
Dude is like Houdini.
"Seriously, when the going gets tough you don't want a criminal lawyer."
"You want a ""criminal"" lawyer."
Know what I'm saying?
"Look, we're in good shape, Mr. White."
Badger is way too loyal to roll.
"Plus, he's scared shitless of me, all right."
We pay four large.
Cost of business.
Take it out of his payroll.
"And it's only his first dealing rap so, worst-case scenario, you know, they plead him out."
He does five months picking up litter in an orange jump suit.
So who goes inside?
I don't need them seeing my face.
"Well, I don't need them seeing my face."
Why not?
You look like his typical clientele.
Dick.
Fine.
"We'll flip for it, all right?"
Call it.

"Oh, my God."
I'm fatter than the skipper.
Ok.
Enough.
This is brutal.
"I knew I wasn't slim or even normal size, but seein' that bag, you know?"
"Honey, you are really overreacting to this."
"I mean, you are totally attractive."
So you--you still love me?
"Of course, I still love you."
I love you no matter what.
"What does that mean, ""no matter what""?"
Nothing.
Just that I love you.
"No, ""no matter what"" means you love me even though I have some sort of problem, like no job or no money, or biggie can't fit through doorway!"
Ok.
I take it back.
I love you.
That's it.
Period.
"No, come on, Carrie."
I'm being serious here.
Let's go.
You're telling me right now you have no problem with that area in here?
Nothing?
"Well, you know, for health reasons-- no, no, no, no."
"I'm not talkin' about health here, ok?"
Let's assume I'm in perfect health and I don't have that flutter.
I want to know right now:
You worried about me?
- You were scared.
- Shut up.
"No, you were scared to go into the second tower on your own."
"I think you were afraid to go up the first time, so you were hoping that you could find some bullshit reason so you could stay downstairs."
Makes all kinds of sense right now.
"This is it, right?"
"This is it, pops.This is it, ain't it?"
- That ain't it.
- This is it.
This is the nail right on the goddamn head.
"- I'm warning you, johnny."
- Warning me how?
"This makes perfect, complete sense here."
"Wait, wait, you didn't want to go in, tom?"
Of course I wanted to go in.
You didn't want to go in.
Holy shit.
"Shut your fat cop face, johnny, ok."
- You don't know shit about it.
- Why?
'Cause you're a cop.
You don't know shit about it.
I know a bullshit rap when i hear it.
"I swear on my kids' souls, johnny."
You're a goddamn coward.
All this show.
All the balls.
All the bravado.
Running in like a madman.
"Tommy ""goddamn"" gavin, the firefighter with the biggest cock on the goddamn block."
"You know what, it's all bullshit, bro."
- You've lost your mind.
What is that?
Is that why I came?
To meet Anna and see Helene?
You want to buy me?
- I don't want to buy you.
- That's what it says here.
"Fine, then let's say that."
Think of what you could do with the money.
How many you could help.
Wouldn't you sell yourself for that?
- Come on.
I know you would.
- You don't know shit about me.
I know all about you.
You're a good person.
"Naive, but well-intentioned."
Except for some water projects and some schools in Bangalore   not one of your projects has succeeded in the last 15 years.
"You're good at finding people to help, but not at financing it."
- You've been checking me out?
- Your orphanage has to close.
All your sweet little kids will be on the street again.
You fat pig.
"Is it fun playing God, you big, fat pig?"
It's not true.
I'm just saying that you're lying to yourself.
You're an idiot if you don't take this chance.
"You can kiss my ass, Jorgen."
"- Jacob, wait."
- I don't want to talk to you.
"You're right, Jacob."
Don't touch me!
-Because it's not.
What's his name?
-Daniel.
"Daniel is in college, and he faces issues completely different than yours."
What do you mean?
Strikes and all that?
-For example.
Well we're gonna make one.
I don't know if not going to school is considered as a strike.
I'm not sure about that at all!
You're so reactionary.
I'm worried about you dating an 18 years old boy.
And what if he were 20?
I'd be more worried.
Don't laugh about it.
It's not funny at all.
It's not that.
"The other day, a guy who's 20 asked me to go to skate with him."
Then tell him to go to skate with his mom.
"Hey, that would be if I wouldn't wanted to go, huh?"
Don't talk to me like that!
Can I know why are you upset?
"-I'm not, I'm just worried."
You sound just like mom.
"""Don't talk to me like that!"""
Is there any of your friends talking to their fathers about this stuff?
Not that I know of.
And is there anyone brave enough to tell them the same?
Neither.
And what about that priest you guys are meeting.
You talk like that?
Like you and me?
No kid of mine is going to hand me any lip!
I didn't sweat half my life in a steel box to come out and get this from you!
You're Joe!
"Joe Krozac, jr., Understand?"
And you and I are going back to that dame -your mother-
"She'll tell you that I'm your father from first to last, understand ?"
- Yes.
- You gonna behave ?
Sure.
"Sure, I am."
Come on.
We got to get out of this.
Dig in under.
That's what you do with a haystack.
Did you leave any money for the eggs?
"Boy, you sure got funny ideas."
But you and I are going to get along all right.
We won't have any more beefs on each other.
I hope not.
'Cause you got brains.
"You know, I like brains around me."
"Your angle on digging last night, you know?"
"And this fire, with the poles and everything-"
Where did you learn that kind of stuff?
From dads.
"You see, he taught me all about camping out like this."
"You see, we went on a camp hike last month-"
"Come on, come on."
Let's get moving.
- We had a race to see who could-
"- Come on, come on."
"catch the most fish, and he caught 20 bass and pickerel, and that only made-"
Where are your two pals?
Ray and Pluto?
They'll be here soon.
How soon is that?
I don't know.
They have to call first.
How do I know you're not lying to me right now?
How do I know they're not going to show up here any minute?
"I'm not lying to you, Dale."
What are you going to do with me?
Go on.
Get in the other room.
Go on.
Go on in the living room.
What are you doing?
Sit down.
No!
What are you doing?
"There's some fellows from L.A. that want to meet you, Lila."
"Dale, put the phone down."
Why should I do that?
'Cause Ray and Pluto are gonna be calling out here to see if everything is cool.
And I'm not going to answer the phone if you call those cops out.
"Oh, yes, you are."
I won't.
Goddamn it!
"Lila, even if I wanted to, I can't help you."
I don't have the legal authority.
"You didn't have the legal authority to fuck me when I was 17 years old, but that didn't stop you then, did it?"
"Yeah, that's right."
"Instead of sitting out there spying on me all night, why didn't you just come in here and say hello to your son?"
He's not my kid.
She knows.
"She knows I'm helping you, she knows I'm following them."
She knows everything.
And she bugged my house.
Are you sure?
Absolutely.
They were all over the place.
And they weren't even that careful.
And she made very sure I was aware of it.
She probably wanted to goad you into making contact with us.
Yeah.
They had someone follow me.
I almost killed myself unloading the son of a bitch.
"So, Fi, what do I do?"
"I mean, she's getting closer, and I don't know how much more we can meet like this."
"Well, I'll talk to Michael."
"But in the meantime, if you need to reach us, you leave the house and use this, okay?"
It's a burner phone.
It should be safe to use.
Wait.
One more thing.
"A long time ago, Michael disappeared, and he never said goodbye."
Promise me you won't do that.
I promise.
Nothing here.
Anything on your side?
Jabbar rolls pretty heavy.
"My guess is, when he comes, we're both gonna see him."
"So, where do you think you're gonna go -- after this is all over?"
I don't know.
I have no idea.
How about you?
- Yeah.
I wanted to see what it looked like on.
"It must be so cool being you, all kick-ass and everything."
I bet you always get what you want.
You'd be surprised.
"- So you're feeling better, then?"
"- Oh, much."
I just feel so safe here.
Feels so right.
"Jenny I know what it's like to be led on and I would hate to do that to you, so ..."
"I'm saying this not to be cruel, but to be clear."
"You staying here, it's just temporary."
Yeah.
Of course.
I'll be out of your hair as soon as it's safe.
Just say the word.
- Dyson.
- I have Olivia.
We're at the clinic.
"- So we can relax, then?"
- Or you can get your ass down here.
The Ash wants you to explain this.
"- Well, what if I say my calendar's full?"
- Don't.
- What's up?
- I've been summoned.
You are not leaving me with Weepy McWeepster.
"Oh, yeah, about that."
I need for you to do something for me.
"I'm not giving her a sponge bath, I swear to God."
"I put too much oomph in my zing, and she's crushing on me big time."
I need for you to talk her out of it gently.
"Sorry, I am late."
Ghost!
Ghost!
Hey!
What's going on?
It's a mess.
I can't manage to explain.
Help...
Wu Man.
"How is it, hubby?"
"I sent you to UK to study law, why do you come back suddenly?"
I wish to give you a surprise.
It's really a surprise.
Let's eat.
"By the way, why were you flushed out of the room by water?"
And I see traps all over the house.
Do you have time to tell something about it?
"I have time, but it's not convenient to talk right now."
"Madam, don't mistake it."
Master knows that
I have an indecent and brutal desire.
"So he arranged all the traps, to let me have chance to kiss Miss Shiu."
Don't misunderstand him.
"But, master..."
"About the pig's tongue, isn't it convenient to give me an explanation?"
"Sure, but I don't have time."
"That's good, even you have time to talk, we don't have time to listen."
"Foon, you kissed the pig's tongue, didn't you?"
I did.
"Right, I bought that specially for you."
"Master, you promised to let me kiss Miss Shiu."
"In fact, it's me who wanted to kiss her."
A bit.
Don't catch a cold.
"When you get home, have a glass of hot milk, with some honey."
I will.
I like rainy days since I've been here.
Have you seen the new lawyer?
Yes.
He was here.
He told me everything.
"I'm screwed, right?"
"To be honest, yes."
At least Alicia wasn't affected by the birth.
It's the only thing that consoles me and gives me hope.
Are you all right?
I'd like to be able to hug you.
But I'd have to ask for a visavis.
"I checked it out, y'know?"
They asked if you were my boyfriend.
"I didn't dare to say yes, in case it bothered you."
It doesn't bother me at all.
You can say what you want.
I've hugged very few people in my life.
A message...
"Marco, I wanted to tell you how glad I was to see you today and be able to say goodbye."
You know they won't let me out of here.
Or it'll only be to lock me up somewhere else.
"I don't want to live in a world without Alicia, a place where I can't even have her hairclip with me."
So I've decided to escape.
"ldidn't tell you, so you wouldn't worry or try to stop me."
"A big hug, Marco."
Taxi!
To Segovia.
"Yeah, one day we'll look back we'll smile and we'll laugh."
But right now we just cry.
'Cause it's so hard to say goodbye.
Yesterday's gone.
We've got to keep moving on.
I'm so thankful for the moments.
So glad I got to know you.
The times that we had.
I'll keep like a photograph.
And hold you in my heart forever.
I'll always remember you.
I'll always remember you.
I'll always remember you.
[Mouthing] Thank you.
So Hannah you said you had some big news for us.
Half of our staff thinks you're running for governor.
The other half thinks you're going back on Flitter.
And Lenny hoping you're back for him.
"No, no, and Lenny, get a life."
"I mean, what is that?"
I don't want to be pushy.
But I've never had the same person on twice in one week.
"Actually, Jay, that's still kind of true."
I'm not the same person.
No.
No of course you're not.
[Whistles]
I think it would be easier this way.
Where are you going?
What are you doing?
"Hey Lenny, I'm starting to think you dodged a bullet with this chick."
[All murmuring]
"European third type, that."
I have a job for you.
Mickey goes wrong.
She lost the joy of living.
We transmit life if he continues with that woman.
"Take it away, do it for me."
"If it is not cheerful, Mickey's not a dick."
"I do not want to see him, I do not want them both!"
"I do not want, no, no!"
"Purposes before, and now blames me?"
"- The love for piety, Mickey ..."
- I pity you did not?
- The love for pain.
- I love her and that was it.
- You will comply.
- Respect for the cemeteries!
You will not ever.
To have you in their hands has taken this empty apartment here in front.
"Okay, your part to exterminate the Venini you have done, but we still have three to go to the bottom."
You feel?
Now it is you who will flee.
Mickey is not the brute that you think.
I do not think anything.
You ... it is difficult to get wrong.
"In order to kill, should be a woman."
Wrap the blade in silk.
- Won't feel anything.
- No.
You.
Get in there.
No. ..
"We are like children, Prince."
What?
You do not have to say anything...
His cab is going to forensic services.
And so are his trainers.
"I swear to god, she got out and that was the last I saw of her."
Just like you never saw Kelly Mahon after she got out of your cab?
That's the truth.
So why did you run?
Straight up?
My cousin gave me a load of iPads last night.
"What, nicked I take it?"
They were in the boot of my cab.
I thought you were after them.
"You been inside, Carl?"
You know I have.
Two years GBH.
"Yeah, that's right.And your DNA was all over the bloke you punched."
The bloke insulted my girl.
I knocked him once.
Then the old Bill bang on my door.
But it was blood on your clothes that got you convicted?
Yeah.
But what's any of this got to do with those girls?
We think you've got a grudge against women who work in forensic services.
"You're joking, right?"
No.
"I mean, two years to sit in jail and stew over whose fault it was that you were sitting in that cell."
I know whose fault it was.
It was mine.
And the drink.
Not Kelly Mahon's?
Not Lucy Kennard's?
"You know, I've always tried to be there for you."
"I was off making the money, they money that is in that trust fund."
I guess I hoped that you'd be there for me now.
"Well... it's up to you now, isn't it?"
"Excuse me, Amelia?"
Let me guess.
"You want to audition, and you're looking for advice."
"Well, I don't know what to tell you, except maybe lose 20 pounds and sleep with the choreographer."
"Actually, I'm not a dancer."
I'm a journalist.
"I'm from ""Interview"" Magazine."
They told me you were ready to talk to me.
"Wait, you're from ""Interview""?"
I'm sorry.
I didn't think you...
"I mean, you're so young."
"Well, I could say the same thing about you."
I'm 17.
"In this business, that's about a year away from being pushed out."
"And here I was, expecting I would have to talk to some old person."
"Nope, just me."
Cool.
"Look, I want to apologize."
- No need.
- It's just...
It's not what it looks like.
"Oh, it's not?"
Because it looks like you're married.
"Yes, but it's an open marriage."
We both want to be with other people.
Really?
That's not just a lie so you don't look like a snake?
When?
"I mean, high school is over."
If I don't fix this tonight some of these people will never talk to me.
And what happens next year?
"What, she does this next Serena and Nate and Dan and Blair."
"Well, what else can you do?"
It is too easy for her to sit behind a computer and not face the damage she's done.
- Wait.
"That's not true, is it?"
- No.
But she doesn't know that.
You didn't get to use your gossip.
"Well, here's something new."
"I told Chuck I loved him, again."
"And he didn't say it back, again."
"- Blair, I'm not gonna tell people that."
- I'm giving you what you need to be queen.
- Don't wanna be queen.
I just wanted a chance to have a life in school.
- Look what it almost made me do.
- That's the thing.
You need to be cool to be queen.
Anne Boleyn thought only with her heart.
She got her head chopped off.
So her daughter Elizabeth made a vow never to marry a man.
She married her country.
Forget boys.
"Keep your eye on the prize, Jenny Humphrey."
"You can't make people love you, but you can make them fear you."
For what it's worth you're my queen.
I choose you.
Thank you.
Do you want me to use my mouth?
- No.
- What?
What's wrong?
L...
I'm...
I'm just too upset.
And I've had too much to drink.
- I have to go.
"- Well, Clark, you don't have to leave."
"Yes, I do."
"[Door Opens, Closes]"
"[Woman] If you do engage in a lot of foreplay... so that you are going to be very moist inside the vagina... and if you are putting your behind on a pillow... so that penetration is going to be a little bit easier... the more relaxed you are, the less it's going to be a problem."
What you also can do is actually help him insert the penis into the vagina... because this way you have some control over how fast...
Mind if I turn it off?
No.
Go ahead.
And I'll tell you what...
If the two of you love each other...
- You going somewhere?
"- Uh, my mom's."
Oh.
Did you mention that?
I-I don't remember.
- She's not feeling that well.
"- Oh, no."
I'm sorry.
"No, it's nothing serious."
"I just haven't seen her in a while, so I thought that..."
[Sighs]
My mom is not sick.
She's not sick.
I can't wait to catch up with all of you when this is done.
"My dad died, and..."
"Again, when this is done, Hitchcock."
"Gina, you look like a fresh wizard, and I love it."
"So we know that Figgis is in Coral Palms, but we don't know where he is, and we don't know how many guys he's got with him."
The plan is to lure them into the Fun Zone and ambush them.
- Any questions?
"- Yes, did you miss us?"
Did you ever look up at the moon and wonder if I was looking at it too?
- Yes.
- Knew it.
"All right, once we get to the Fun Zone,"
I'll fill everyone in on the mission details.
You guys come with me.
"Captain, you stay here and rest."
What?
I don't need to rest.
I'm in peak condition.
"All right, then stand up."
Easy.
I love standing up.
"Yeah, you're staying here."
"Aw, Captain, don't worry, okay?"
"My sleeping pills are doing their job, and I can stay here and take care of you, okay?"
"Terry, I'm gonna need your gun."
That's not happening.
"All right, I'll use my own."
Oops-a-daisy.
That is adorable.
Where did you get that?
Vending machine at a rest stop.
Give me that.
I still believe things will work out for the best.
What do you believe in?
What do you believe?
I believe everything.
I'm just talking about the past.
"And today we go to a party for the first time with our daughter, and we quarrel about some stupid champagne."
That's all!
Champagne.
"One Martell, as if..."
Heaven's... what did you do there?
"You kept counting, you weren't even interested in what was going on."
You admire a poet...
That's just like you.
You come to a party and you say...
Recite the poem Bacardi for me.
To drink baccardi...
Have you ever drunk it?
"Of course, but not with you."
I haven't.
Why didn't you let us have it?
Why did you hum and ha?
"Don't ask me who I drank it with, I don't ask you who you drank what with."
What with who?
With no one.
And I've never tasted Bacardi!
What do you think it is?
Some Cuban cognac.
"No idea, of course."
What are you getting at now?
I don't know why you made such a fuss.
is that what we were making preparations for?
It wasn't how I imagined it either!
What are you doing?
"Before it was even time to go home, he was pushing me into the car then pulling me out."
It was ridiculous.
But Diane and Tommy made us promise to meet them again on Friday night.
We agreed.
"Of course, when Friday night came around, Henry stood me up."
I feel terrible. I don't know where he is.
"He really liked you, too."
That's all he did was talk about her.
We were a trio instead of a double date that night.
He should have called.
I hope it's nothing serious.
But I made Tommy take me looking for him.
"Tommy, what the fuck?"
You got some nerve standing me up.
Nobody does that to me.
"Who the hell do you think you are, Frankie Valli or some kind of big shot?"
"Slow down, alright."
I forgot. I thought it was next week.
"It was this Friday and you agreed, so you're a liar!"
We can talk about this.
Talk to you after what you just did to me?
Forget it.
I thought you were gonna stand me up.
You looked bored.
You didn't say anything.
What did you expect?
Let me make it up to you...
Karen.
I'll think about it.
"I remember, she was screaming on the street, and I mean loud."
-But she looked good.
That doesn't matter.
You said you weresn't 21.
There's a big difference between 21 and 16.
"Look, I'm sorry."
"You're beautiful, but I have to leave."
I feel really guilty.
I wish I had met you in high school.
I wouldn't have liked you then.
That's true.
If you really have to go
I want to give you something to remember me by.
And you can tell Jim he can put me in his movie.
Don't do that.
- Dad!
- What the hell is going on here?
That's right.
"Run, you little sick."
"Oh, shit, the script."
- You're gonna go to your mother's.
- You don't understand me.
I don't want to.
You're gonna go to your mother's.
You can't deal with being attracted to your own daughter.
Do not try to pull transference on me.
I invented transference.
"I called the girl, but she's already in Connecticut with her mom so she can't get the screenplay."
- What the hell am I gonna do?
- You gotta break into that place.
I can't break into a therapy office.
Why?
What difference does it make?
You gotta get in there.
"Well, I was mistaken."
I've got a pretty good steak knife...
Just try to help.
"You go out the front door, you hook a right."
"Then walk three blocks straight down, its on this side of the street."
You can't miss it.
- I'll go Daze.
- Why can't I?
"Because you look 12, and I've an ID."
We might actually checked in this part of town.
"Just keep an eye on him while I'm gone, and remember what I said."
Okay.
You guys need anything?
"No, we're good."
So how long have you two been friends?
"I'm not supposed to really talk to you anymore, so..."
"Oh, wait!"
I think you got a phone message.
"But that's all I'm sayin', now I'm gonna zip."
You have one new message.
"This is really the last time, I'm gonna say this to you."
Okay?
or anything else...
"I don't want you to send me anything anymore, I don't..."
I threw out those flowers.
You can't fix it.
And I'm really... done with you.
"I don't want talk to you again, I don't want to hear from you again."
I want you to leave me alone...
Me and Vi have been friends for a pretty long time.
Maybe three years.
What?
She picks up the phone and calls from the house.
"If anybody was listening, they'd know everything."
"They'd know a package was leaving my house and they'd even have the time and flight number, thanks to her."
"As soon as I got home, I started cooking."
I had a few hours until Lois' flight.
I told my brother to keep eye on the stove.
All day long the guy's been watching helicopters and tomato sauce.
"You see, I had to drive over to Sandy's, mix the stuff, then get back to the gravy."
"Do you think you can come over here, fuck me, and leave?"
- Come on.
- You got someplace better to go?
Don't talk like that.
Come on.
- You all right?
"- Yeah, sure."
You believe me?
Do you believe me?
Do you believe me?
- That the last one?
- Yeah.
You lying son of a bitch.
I hate you!
Please stop feeding the dog from the table from the plate on top of it.
Stop it.
- I have to.
- You don't have to.
I got to go home.
"What do you mean, you got to go home?"
I've been carrying this all day.
We got to start taping it to your leg.
We got to go soon.
I got to go home and get my hat.
I'll have to get you a wedding present.
"Oh, no, no, please."
You don't have to do that.
"So, you're a sophomore?"
Yeah.
Are you a freshman somewhere?
"No, I'm a senior."
In high school.
I'll be going to college next year.
I hope.
Great.
You're gonna love it.
I love it.
Great.
"So, do you, like, have a boyfriend or anything?"
No.
"I went out with this guy recently, but he's a jock."
You know how jocks are.
"It was just, you know, a physical thing, I guess."
"For him, anyway."
"Actually, I don't really know how that is."
"I've only really dated Ricky and a couple of other guys, but no jocks."
"Well, I mean, Ricky is a jock, right?"
He's an amazing baseball player.
Or did he give that up?
"Yeah, I guess he did give it up."
"Oh, man, he was playing for this team one summer and they were going to nationals and he had a no-hit season going."
It was unprecedented.
His name is probably on some plaque or something.
And then he drew a bunch of body parts on the bases.
"Like first base for first base, second base for second..."
"Yeah, I get it."
"What is it with you, huh?"
"Ah, this fuckin' guy ain't ready."
I knew you weren't gonna be ready.
-You didn't bring coffee?
"-What do I look like, a fuckin' caterer?"
Frankie will make coffee.
Make coffee.
Thought you'd have one of your bitches in here.
"Yeah, I did."
Where the fuck is she?
"Always got these hot books around though, or a bitch, or somethin'."
What time is it?
-lt's 11:30.
We were supposed to be there by 9:00.
-l'll be ready in just a minute.
"Yeah, you're always fucking late."
You'd be late for your own fuckin' funeral.
What the fuck you looking at?
"Come on, make that coffee to go."
Let's go.
What the fuck you doing?
It's a joke.
A joke.
Put the fucking pot down.
Ya gonna take the coffee?
Stacks was always crazy.
"Instead of getting rid of the truck like he was supposed to, he got stoned went to his girlfriend's, and by the time he woke up, the cops had found the truck."
It was all over the television.
They even said they came up with prints off the wheel.
It was just a matter of time before they got to Stacks.
I gotta talk to you.
-Have a drink.
"Look, I can I just talk to you for a second, Dale?"
Just about you and me and about us and what's happening here.
What about us?
"I don't know, I just..."
I think I'm falling in love with you.
"And I know that scares you, and I-"
It's not gonna really-
"I'm not going anywhere, Dale."
I'm not gonna die on you.
"I'm not your mother, or your father."
You are so scared of anything that's real.
And I'm right here.
And I just want to know if you feel the same way.
"You hooked up with one of my best friends, Zach."
Wow.
"Wow, I thought I understood what was going on here."
But I guess I was just I guess I was just totally wrong.
I can't believe you're saying that about me.
I can't believe you don't trust me.
I just want something real.
I've been chasing you for two years Dale.
Two years.
You know how that feels?
But I can't do it anymore.
Not if you don't feel the same way about me.
"Goodbye, Dale."
I told Zach I want something real.
And here I go screwing up the best chance I'll ever have at something real.
What do you think I wished...
for my birthday?
It... starts with Z and ends with Ack.
And it turns out...
* They only will shine for me * in your eyes
* You are all that matters
* And I've got you
* We're on top and we won't fall
* No fortune that we can boast
* We're happy with tea and toast
* For we've got love
* And love matters most * of all
(EXCLAIMING)
"Good morning, Willy."
"Oh, uh, good morning, Aunt Nancy."
Did you sleep well?
"Yes, fine, thank you."
What happened?
The train ain't moving?
A bridge washed out down the road.
There's nothing to be frightened of.
"Oh, I'm not frightened when I'm with you."
That's very nice.
"You know, someday, I hope I have a little man like you."
That's very nice.
You know something?
"When I met you last night, that was the nicest thing that ever happened to me."
"Well, thank you, Willy."
"Well, you know, it... it's like..."
"Well, everything is different."
It's...
"Well, it's very hard to explain, but I have a very funny feeling in my stomach."
What you need is a good breakfast.
You're a growing boy.
"Oh, that's what I wanted to talk to you about."
We'll have a nice talk right after breakfast.
I know.
And now we're not together.
I know.
"Well we just got to-- like I said, man."
We're gonna get this in a master.
"We're gonna get closer, and we're gonna get this."
"We just need this for the master shot, all right?"
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
So--
Is there any way to go back and just
Do the first 12 feet of this?
"Because in the rehearsal, you said I would"
"Carry both of them, right?"
-We'll do a close-up.
We'll do close-ups.
We'll do this thing.
We'll have you carrying them out tight.
You're like this big in the stuff I'm doing.
So we'll get you-- we'll do it again.
It's just not gonna match if I'm-
"- I mean,"
I was carrying them both in rehearsal [inaudible].
Now we're going to do it to match the way it was
When you walked out the door.
And that was--
That's what I'm saying.
"When you walked out the door in there, you had him,"
And you had her on your arm.
And we did that.
We had her on--
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"Well, can we just do this"
I...
I can't hear you.
I'm in a train.
"Okay, have a nice bike ride."
Whoa.
Ramon just threw a rock at me.
We're still friends.
What kind of God would put a chocolate fountain on a train and not let kids near it?
!
Yeah!
"Learn how to build a train, God!"
"Well... the chocolate fountain is impressive, but the real supply's all the way up front."
"What do you mean, ""The real supply?"""
There's way more chocolate up in the kitchen.
I've seen them load boxes and boxes of it in there.
"Well, then, are you guys thinking what I'm thinking?"
That I need a bath?
"Oh, yeah."
You do.
No.
We break out of here and steal the chocolate from the front of the train!
I'd do that.
I'm in.
Great!
The Belcher kids ride again!
For the first time!
And Rudy!
Is there.
"Okay, if we're gonna rob this train, we need to take it step by step."
"Luckily, Rudy has been trapped in this caboose for the last nine weekends doing some serious recon."
I see everything out this window.
"Once, a skunk got on the train for a little bit and then it got off and I was the only one to notice."
"By saving all these children, do you want to be a hero?"
I'm not doing this for the people.
I'm doing it for myself.
The happiness I saw in her smile...
"If there is so much kick in one smile, think about the kick in millions of such smiles."
I want that kick.
I want that kick.
The kick started from a child's smile.
It won't stop.
"Nowadays, people want to be happy even on someone else's sorrows."
He looks for happiness in others' happiness.
He is not giving any suggestions.
He is not fighting against the system.
He never orders anyone to do something.
He does what he wants to do.
He is not saving those children.
He is showing us the kick in saving others.
Which father will get such a great son?
I get lot of kick.
"Till now, I wanted to see what he will become."
He has now become a thief.
He has become a true human.
What if he gets caught?
There is truth in his efforts.
Nothing will happen to him.
He will not get caught until he completes his job.
Where is he now?
What if I lose?
What if I lose?
"When did you come, boss?"
How are you?
What?
"Yeah, all right."
I'll get 'em.
Hmm.
I hope it won't be too heavy for you to carry.
- See youse later.
- All right.
"Say, uh, what do we need the nails and hammers for?"
"Well, the snow's disappearing fast."
We'll have to cache the sled later on and build a boat.
Oh?
"Say, uh, look-"
Yeah?
What is it?
"I, uh-"
I got something to tell you.
Maybe you better take it sitting down.
You know how I feel about women in this country.
Where we're going is ten times as tough and rugged...
- as anything you've seen up to now.
- What are you getting at?
"Well, just this."
I paid your room rent here at the hotel... and I'll leave you enough money for expenses until we get back.
You mean I'm supposed to wait here while you and Shorty go-
That's it.
I've been wondering whether you'd try something like this.
"Well, if you're going, I'm going too."
- You mean you don't trust us?
- I mean exactly that.
"All right, Shorty and I will stay here."
You go find the mine.
"- Oh, don't be smart."
"- Well, you're not going."
Maybe we could help you?
That won't be necessary.
We're sick of doing nothing.
We're sick of being afraid all the time!
"That thing is hunting in daylight, now!"
We'll never be safe.
Just be patient.
We'll take care of it.
See?
I told you she wasn't responsible for the killings.
The serum makes it unnecessary for her to feed.
Can you confirm that?
Not yet.
It'll be a while before I can complete my analysis.
Alright.
"Well, in the meantime, there's another Wraith out there."
I believe Ellia may be able to help us find it.
How?
May I speak with her?
Alright.
May I join you?
"Ellia, we need your help."
You can sense the other Wraith.
It is alright.
It is nothing to be ashamed of.
"In fact, I have the same ability."
Really?
"I sensed you in the forest, when you were watching us."
And I knew even then that you were different.
"Your father has raised you well, he has taught you right from wrong."
You are not like the other one.
I don't let him in.
- So?
- So everything's goin' great.
Terrific.
Beautiful.
"I'll need a few more days, though."
"The boys think we oughta cool it for a while, just to make sure there's no heat."
You must take me for an imbecile.
Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?
I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a policeman.
"Look, I'm levellin' with you."
I need a little more time.
"My people think we oughta find a better time to make the switch, that's all."
It has to be by the end ofthis week.
"Look, Charnier, you gotta be reasonable."
It's your problem.
"Well, it's your problem, too."
So nice to have seen you again.
We found a set ofworks on the kid driving the sports car.
- His girlfriend's in the back.
She's dead.
- Give the car a toss.
- I say we keep sitting' on Boca.
"- Jimmy, give it up."
It's all over with.
"Ifthere was a deal, it's gone down by now."
We blew our warrants and we blew our cover.
"Listen, I know the deal hasn't gone down."
I know it.
I can feel it.
I'm dead certain.
"Last time you were dead certain, we ended up with a dead cop."
Break it up!
I still can't understand.
Nothing explains how Greta got in.
OTIS:
"Through the door, don't you see?"
"But I'm sure, positive it was closed."
"Now, Greta is a very strong dog."
It wouldn't be much of a problem for her to just push it open.
"It's so strange, the things she seems to be able to do."
"Has she ever tried to attack you, ever been vicious?"
Just the opposite.
She's the most gentle dog I've ever known.
They'll be through in there in just a minute.
"Oh, good."
"Uh, I'll be downtown in a little while."
You go on with them.
OK.
AUDREY:
I know this sounds crazy.
But it's something I feel very often.
"When I'm with her alone, sometimes it"
Feels more like I'm in the room with a person.
She watches me.
Do you think I'm losing it?
"I mean, like Mom?"
"No, no, of course not."
You can handle it.
Will they arrest me?
"No, no need worrying about that."
"But you'll have to admit, it looks"
A little bit fishy though.
"This is the second one to die recently,"
And you were the last one to see them... just you.
"""This is fun."
Do it anyways.
"They'll figure out how to save you."""
It just gets quieter and quieter.
Pretty soon I won't be able to hear it at all.
"But before it dies, I want to say good-bye to it the right way."
We'll give it the best send-off any crazy voice could ever ask for.
I'd do it for mine.
"...and then, right around the time I was starting to walk, there was some kind of..."
Ah...
I don't know.
Let's stop.
I want to stop.
"Honey, please, keep going."
You can't stop now.
"No, I don't want to."
We've been sitting here for five hours.
"Why are we doing this, anyway?"
"Francis, please."
I think we're really close.
Just one more time.
Well...
I kind of remember that Frisbee game we used to play...
"Okay, honey."
Maybe we'll eat later.
"Lois, did you see what he did in there?"
He used my tennis racket to smash my camera and all my lenses to bits!
I still had film in it from the Us Festival!
Where is he?
"Hal, it's not his fault!"
I'm pretty sure he's working through a limitation-anxiety phase.
All the literature says this is the age where he's trying...
And I lied to a whole lot of people who you didn't wanna talk to.
And I also listened to your friends tell me what a great boss I had.
As if I needed to hear that.
"Alex, I know you."
I know what a good man you are.
And I know how you've tried with Louise.
I love you for that.
All right.
Now just tell me one thing.
"When you were up in that kitchen a while ago, chopping those vegetables, you were very happy."
Yes.
And why did it change after that telephone call?
"You called her before when I was up there in the kitchen, right?"
You don't get a divorce on the telephone!
What difference does it make?
It's over with!
"Now, wait a minute!"
[Sighs]
I should've told her earlier.
You wanna know why I didn't talk to her?
I just wasn't sure how you'd react when I told you that I loved you.
"[Chuckles] Oh, no."
You weren't sure how I'd react?
- That's right.
"- Alex, what you decide with Louise... shouldn't be tied up with my reactions."
Go and find her.
Talk to her.
"Even if she hates you, she needs you."
And when you've got that settled...
Okay.
All right.
"I'm not going to, uh, lose you, am I?"
"I know where my life is going, and I want you to go with me."
"I'm not saying I want you to move in right now but I don't want to buy this place unless, at some point you could see yourself moving in."
"So, what do you think?"
I can't do this.
Okay.
"Well, if it's too fast, I guess we can always just..."
I can't do any of this.
I mean what you're saying and what you're offering is what every girl wants.
It's what I always wanted.
It's just...
You don't want it with me.
Okay.
I have a question.
"Is there any way we could dial it back to before, when we were just sleeping together because I don't know, I felt like that gelled."
Babe?
It was nice meeting you.
Thank you so much for a lovely evening.
You too.
Good night.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
You forget something?
"Yeah, I did."
Really?
What did you forget?
This.
You came all the way here at 11:00 at night to bring me back a promotional pen?
Yeah.
I thought I should just come up with some really great excuse to get over here.
"That's how it's done, isn't it?"
Sometimes.
"Look, I can't stop thinking about you."
It's a problem.
"- Well, I mean..."
"- Oh, I think that's Amy."
- Where?
"Jesus Christ, I'm in the back seat and I can fucking see her."
"Oh, right there."
"Okay, fine."
- Congressman.
"- Oh, wow."
"Well, this is freaky."
"Look, I'm not hiding, just so you know."
"Okay, Congressman, time to exit through the gift shop."
"Okay, sir, you're gonna have to come with us."
"Guys, my mom is too ill to be left alone right now."
"I mean, I left her alone right now because she likes to read."
But she can't read right now because she's very sick.
But she might get better.
Or she might not get better.
- She could be buried with a book.
- We know she's not dying.
"- She's a fighter, is the thing."
- Good for her.
"As weird as it feels to still be saying this, the president would like to see you at the White House."
I feel like I'm about to kick it old school and die in office.
Quitting on a high.
Do you think I'm doing the right thing here?
"I mean, this is a good bill."
"Even watered down, I think it's gonna make a difference in people's lives."
"Ma'am, you're the president."
It's not for me to tell you what to do.
Yeah.
Guess I should kill it.
Is the right answer.
"On the contrary, he sings because he's glad."
He's glad to die.
- The number of legends about swans...
- Dr. Kay.
"They also say swans guide and keep company with the dead, to help them cross the threshold."
That's my favorite...
a very old Celtic legend.
"- Yes, I know it."
- You do?
"- Yes, my wife told me about it."
- Your wife told you about it?
Right.
You mean your ex-wife?
We all live in glass houses.
So I see.
Why don't you finally tell me what I can do for you?
I believe I'm the one who can do something for you.
But you'll see for yourself.
Certain experiences can be very unsettling.
"I'll see what, for God's sake?"
What experiences?
I'm merely pointing out the need to be prepared.
Is that a threat?
"No, it's not a threat."
It's a message.
But I'm not quite sure you're ready to hear it.
How come you know so much about me?
Did you have me checked out?
Did you... was it Ross told you all that stuff?
"""The need to be prepared."" What's that supposed to mean?"
I don't know this Ross person.
I've never met the guy.
- They never caught on.
- They may.
I'd keep my mouth shut.
Why?
"We're all Americans here, aren't we?"
The Krauts have a way of getting information.
"Yeah, especially in this barracks."
- How?
- That's what we'd like to know.
There's only one pair left.
"Well, get some more."
"Say, uh, where does a fellow take a hot shower around here?"
"Hot shower, heh?"
Dig him.
Sorry.
No hot showers.
You wash in the latrine.
In a latrine!
"What did you expect, glamour boy?"
"An officers' club with a steam room and a massage, maybe?"
"Hey, just a minute."
You made cracks and I let them slide but I don't intend to take any more.
"If you resent my having money, start a revolution but get off my back."
-All your dough won't help here because here you're on your own.
No mother to throw a lifebelt.
- Now let's see how good you can swim.
"-I can swim, all right."
We own three swimming pools and a private lake.
It figures.
"Sorry, boys, my taxi's waiting."
"Cut the horseplay, Harry."
What's the matter with you guys?
I tried to kill a police officer in India by planting a bomb in his car.
"It happened because of a girl and a boy,"
"I got scared of getting lynched there, so I came to Malaysia."
Just a joke!
"It's not a joke, bloody fools!"
It really happened.
"Come on brother-in-law, where's my sister?"
- My son-in-law.
- Son-in-law?
Oh God!
I got wedged!
What if they come to know I chased this girl?
My brother-in-law will break my back.
"They both were in love there, why are these two marrying here?"
"He's no ordinary man, he'll not give up so easily."
Where could he be now?
Can you guide me to this address?
This is the place.
"By the way, you are...?"
I too don't know when will I come.
I don't know what had happened to me.
I don't know why I'm here.
What's going on here?
I invited you.
He's my friend Kalyan from India.
He's my fiance.
I'll put handcuffs if I get you not shake hands with you.
"Even if you refuse, I'll shake hands with you."
"He's a memory loss patient, he's here for treatment."
He'll stay with us from now.
Okay dear.
"No need to feel sorry, I'm very happy."
Someone will hear us.
That's all I've got to say to you!
Stop it!
I'm sick of it.
"You're the one who keeps following me and makes perverted calls, aren't you?"
That's not me.
I never do things like that!
How can you do things like that?
"And you sent that porn magazine to my company, didn't you!"
?
It wasn't me. I didn't do it.
I wouldn't give this to anyone.
Why do you have it!
?
Nami.
No!
Stop it!
"If I knew your telephone number, I would call you all day."
"And if I'd known where you live, I would've written you a love letter everyday."
What do you want from me?
- The girl in that magazine isn't who I am!
- That's not the you I fell in love with.
Why don't you tear that magazine up then?
Red Porno
You're hopeless.
Why can't you behave normally?
Why do you have to torment me?
"If you get what you want, will you go away?"
This isn't what I want.
This isn't what I hoped would happen.
Will you go out with me tomorrow?
From the department store?
"Well, look around you."
"We're not exactly starving, you know."
"Well, honey, I know we have most of the things we need but just having the things you need isn't everything."
I mean...
I'd like to buy you some things you haven't got.
I've got you.
That's the only thing I really want.
What about that fur coat?
"Oh, Darrin, I haven't heard you talk this way before."
Remember the new account I told you about?
Waterhouse and Company?
The one the agency's been trying to get for years?
Yes.
"Oh, don't tell me you lost it."
"No, we got it all right."
"The trouble is, I will not be handling it."
"Well, did you talk to Larry?"
Larry's the one who told me about it.
"Well, I know how you feel."
But maybe...
"Well, maybe you're just in too much of a hurry to get to the top."
"Remember, you're still young."
"I'm young all right, but I won't always be young."
"If that's Larry, tell him I'm on my way."
Hello.
"Oh, hi, Louise."
"Yeah, sure I'd like to hear some good news."
Larry told you wh...
Darrin's got the Waterhouse account?
"Oh, I can't wait to tell him."
"Oh, well, all right."
"If Larry wants to tell him himself, I understand."
I hear you got a hold of Kuya?
The two are around here.
150 km north of Marshall Islands.
"Well, then..."
"Yes, as soon as repairs to your arm are completed, we want you to go rescue them."
We need to act sooner than that.
We must hurry so that I can pick up where I left off with...
Left off?
"Yes, that is..."
But if that enemy comes back again...
Don't worry!
Dangaioh can take care of that Mohawk dude!
That's not going be easy.
"Judging from the data sent from Flail, it's in no condition to transform into Dangaioh."
"But we just can't sit here and do nothing, right?"
"Yes, you're right..."
Kuya...
Kuya...
Thanks.
"If you didn't come, they would've taken me away."
"No, I should have been more..."
You should have?
I was no match for them at all...
Sorry...
"If I weren't so slow, we could've transformed."
"I'm the weak link, aren't I?"
No way!
Not once have I thought of you that way.
It's just that...
This is a dangerous mission and it's not for everyone.
If there's a way you could step down...
"Don't get me wrong, that's not what I mean."
I am not a gutless coward.
"If I leave like this, I will be sinful for the rest of my life."
I won't live peacefully.
And I will be a criminal forever.
I won't leave.
I come to express my support.
You can't lose in this case.
Because your master's name is so important.
"But now, I know that, you are a real brave and quixotic hero."
I believe that you are innocent.
I'll wait for you.
Good speech!
Will you wait for me?
You'll be released at 5 pm tomorrow.
How about the final address?
They can do nothing to me.
"They can't imagine that, you studied law in UK too."
"Tomorrow, you'll take my place."
Hubby...
You'll handle Foon's life.
You sent me to study law in UK... isn't it because you felt boring?
Of course not!
The world is so big!
"I think, it's a good deed... to let you see the world, is that right?"
"Hubby, I didn't study law in UK."
They rejected me.
"So, what did you study in UK?"
Fashion design.
What did you say?
Time's up.
I studied fashion design.
Fashion design.
"Just go in the bedroom, that's all."
(angry grunt)
That animal is getting out of here immediately!
"- Wait, wait, wait, don't."
-Don't tell me to wait!
Alice knows she can't have a dog!
And she knows why she can't have a dog!
"Who's gonna take him out, huh?"
Me.
"Me, that's who!"
And when do dogs have to get taken out?
Five minutes before I have to go to bed!
That is around midnight!
"And if you think that I'm gonna walk up and down the street in the snow and the sleet and the rain, walking some mutt back and forth, you're nuts!"
Alice is taking that dog back!
- Right back to the pound!
"-Wait a minute, wait a minute."
She ain't taking it back.
Didn't cost you anything or anything.
She's in love with that puppy.
"If you make her take it back to the pound, it'll-it'll break her heart, and it'll cause a big fight, too."
You're absolutely right.
It will cause a fight.
So therefore I'm not gonna have her take it back.
I'll take it back!
- Back you go.
"-Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
Just-just wait a minute.
Wait.
- Wait...
-Don't wait...
Get out of my way!
I want them.
- They just left for the hills.
"Would you shut your mouth, bitch."
Who asked you?
Help me.
"Beware, the sailors were here."
They were completely drunk.
Save yourselves.
There is nothing I can do.
I have no more power left.
"Yes, I can save them by myself if you wait here until daybreak."
You will keep them alive until then!
My powers will leave you and return to me.
I will save them.
"Yes, I know what will happen."
You will be left powerless against your enemies.
You will be quite defenseless.
But they will live thanks to you.
That's good.
It's nearly dawn.
Leave as soon as it's light.
Try to save yourselves.
They will live!
Your revenge escapes you.
In this crazy world.
the only thing that might possibly be left for you is generosity.
- Do they have to die?
- In a short while.
I would like to save them.
They gave us their lives.
Can't you help them?
Nothing can save them now.
"Yeah, nobody knows that better than I do."
Trust me.
But I also know that she knows stuff about people.
She's got a real gift for that.
"So, I'm gonna ask you."
Once.
What was she talking about?
"[inhales, exhales]"
Remember that little ditty I told you about looking for something new in Mexico?
"- Yeah, I remember not buying it."
- I was running.
His name's Clayton.
Met him on the rodeo circuit in Waco.
We were gonna swipe the main till at the stock show.
"Night before the show, he got good and drunk, he beat the shit out of me."
"Jitters, I guess."
"And the next day, we pulled the job."
"And when it came time to run, I left him holding' the bag in a tunnel with a six-pack of good ol' boys."
- So that's who you did the deal with.
- Yeah.
- But how that bitch knew about it...
- Forget it.
- She's like the plague.
- [laughs]
"The longer she's around, the more damage she does, which is why we're skipping this job."
"What are you, crazy?"
"Come on, it's... because of her!"
"Trust me, all right?"
She's bad for business.
- I don't want it.
- That's bullshit.
"- Okay, there's more to it."
"Fair and square, is it not?"
"Look Johnny, my room shouldn't go vacant even for a day."
Your house is like my own!
I wouldn't be able to bear it.
If you were to incur any loss on my account!
May I take one?
Get lost!
Are you a moron?
Rushing to pay the advance when the house isn't even vacant yet!
You haven't understood this city at all.
"Johnny bhai, thank you."
Oye!
What do you think you are doing?
Hey!
I am talking to you!
That is my drawer.
It was my drawer till you stuffed your things in.
Your mother has given me the key.
If my mother gave you the house keys someday..
..would the house be yours too?
I pay my share of the rent every month.
You eat worth much more in a single day!
I will leave your house...
and your drawer as well!
Quit talking about it.
Why don't you actually do it for a change.
I told you not to come here!
What was so important?
You should not trust me so much!
Where else can I keep it?
All the banks are asking for an income proof.
I will come and take it in a couple of weeks.
We should move on as quickly as we can.
"Tom, some of those cows in there are mine."
"What are you looking at, Mr. Coble?"
"We're just gonna water our horses, and we'll be moving on."
You like to buy some of them cows?
"I don't want no trouble, and like I say, we'll be moving on."
How about a little dance?
"Give us a little dance, Mr. Coble."
Dance.
I said dance.
"All right, Mr. Coble, why don't you just ride on out?"
Get that shooter and put it in this water trough.
Move!
You son of a bitch!
"I'll get you, you son of a bitch!"
"Tom, that little deal back there at Brown's Hole... ought to give you an idea of what we've been putting up with out here."
I ain't never seen roping like that.
Damn!
He sure don't rope like no Christian.
I wanna tell you.
Any means that you have to take... to eliminate this rustling problem... we're all behind you 100%.
- Whole organization?
- All of us.
"I'll just have to take your word on that, John."
You got it.
"Hey, Tom."
How you feeling?
We're plugging along.
I'm giving a little party at the house.
I'd like you to meet everybody.
- I'm kind of raggedy.
- Nobody'll mind.
What do you mean you 18 year old?
!
You're under age!
No!
Kids are not allowed to do this!
You can't!
Who said you're not a teacher?
"Yeah, I'm a teacher so I can't watch students drink with my eyes open!"
You don't have to walk me home.
I can go by myself.
You don't have to walk me home.
I can go by myself.
You drank earlier.
How can I just let someone who drank walk the streets?
I only drank this much!
"Teacher Gil, are you that naive?"
It's not like that was the first alcohol I've tasted in my life.
"Anyway, I have no choice but to take responsibility."
"Because you're a student, Kang Kyung Joon."
"Also,"
I'm sorry that you have no choice but to pretend to be my fiancé.
I want to thank you too.
"You don't have to apologize, since you found this for me."
"And if you're thankful, fill this up please."
I have to pay more getting on the bus with this face.
And my clothes!
Do something about it!
"If I stretch a little, it seems like it's going to burst!"
My pants are always riding up like this!
"Yeah, I don't think we can leave his body like this."
Let's go.
To buy new clothes?
I'm having a baby with a woman that I'm very much in love with.
"You told me that you were confused, that you wanted to leave her."
I know.
"I was confused, Kim."
I was so confused.
And it was wrong of me to get you tangled up in that.
How could you not tell me that you were having a baby?
Because I'm an asshole.
I did a bad thing.
I have no excuse.
"There nothing I can say to you other than that I'm so sorry, and it's really not about you at all."
Why do people always say that?
"How can it not be about me if you can sleep with me one minute, and then walk out on me the next?"
"I'm sorry, Kim."
I gotta go.
- All right.
- All right.
"No, you'll be fine."
You are the suckiest driver.
No way.
I'm not.
"Well, how many miles do you think you guys will be making fun of me for?"
I'd say pretty much the whole entire way.
I'm not going to make fun of you.
I think there's a bus stop...
- Is there a bus down there?
"Oh, good."
- It's four miles.
"Because my friends aren't giving me a ride home, so..."
I think it's going to rain.
"Sorry I'm not coming, guys."
"- No, don't apologize."
I knew that I belonged... someplace.
"You know what I mean, Tillie?"
I don't think that...
I don't think there's anything in the world that's more important than that.
- Hey!
What are you doing that for?
- Because I care about you.
Put that down.
You can't make it dragging me.
- You look like a jerk.
- You know me.
I'll do what I say.
"What is this, your mother talking to you or something?"
My mother's dead and we're here.
You'll never make it if you have to take me.
You don't want me anyway.
Is that what you think?
"If you think that, then just do it."
What the hell.
Don't try to rattle me.
"Your father gave me 20 bucks to keep you from running, but if you wanna do that, that's fine."
Blow your guts out all over the mountain.
See if I care.
"Tillie, don't move!"
I won't get any further alone.
"If you hadn't been with me, I wouldn't have got this far."
I would've sat down on that first night by the fire and waited for the snow to cover me over.
Tillie...
I don't wanna go back there without you.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Edgar.
You got any ideas?
"If you know any prayers, don't say 'em now."
They won't do you any good.
"Come on, I got some unfinished business to take care of with the warden."
Write a note.
Tell 'em we'll release you and Lang if they let us out alive.
Release 'em?
"Write 'em, we'll knock you both off in 10 minutes if they don't quit firing."
"My orders in case of riot are to keep firing, regardless of the safety of any official or guard."
Those orders will stand.
[GUNFIRE]
"Stay on the floor, and you won't get hurt."
Maybe.
[GUNFIRE]
Take that undershirt off.
We'll show 'em a white flag.
Here's a chance for you to be a hero.
Take this note over to the twine mill.
"And if you lose it, tell 'em to stop firing."
We give up.
I ain't going.
I don't wanna get killed.
"What do you wanna do, live forever?"
"Here, give it to me."
"Come on, Dale."
Open that door.
[GUNSHOTS]
[GUNFIRE]
[GUNFIRE]
Looks like they don't wanna play.
How bad are you hit?
"Oh, it's just a nick."
- That's our daughter.
"Hey, Jeff..."
"today, at Ritchie's school, with everybody there, I got a glimpse of what the future would be like, and it is so messed up."
Is that because you and Matthew have a baby?
"Okay, stop-- stop looking at the board, okay?"
I...
Oh!
I like you a lot.
And I like you.
So why can't we just look past the other stuff?
"Look, you've got to understand this from my point of view."
"I mean, what if I said that, in order to date me, we'd have to hang out with your ex-wife and her husband?"
I'd rather have diarrhea.
Exactly.
"I mean, it's great when it's just us, but it's never going to be just us."
It's always going to be weird.
Isn't this a conversation for way down the line?
No.
"Way down the line, I'm going to be in love with you, and then it's going to be too painful to tell you I don't want to do this."
You don't want to do this?
It's just...
It's too incestuous.
You dated your second cousin.
"Actually, he was my first cousin."
And I asked him out.
I think you're making a mistake.
Yeah.
That's what my aunt said.
No.
No.
About us.
What?
"Anyway, you're not going to see her anymore."
"Why do I feel like heartbroken, just like my 2nd year in college?"
But this time how can it be a broken-heart?
It can't be.
"A relationship like this where... we meet for a few minutes a month, the doctor is just doing her job."
There's nothing more to it.
So how can I say that I'm heartbroken?
But just now I said heartbroken 3 times.
Shit.
There is no way I'm heartbroken.
You're way brokenhearted bro.
It's not hard to tell.
I've given you my diagnosis.
No way.
Why not?
Sure.
You have all the symptoms.
"You can't eat, or sleep."
I know.
I was a teenager once.
But we didn't even pass go.
"But from what you've told me, you've gone far enough."
Why did you drop all your work to go see her?
You even asked me to play badminton to exercise.
Right?
I was sick.
So I went to see a doctor.
I exercised to get better.
You did it so she would give you props.
You did it for her.
You wanted her to see you doing good things.
"You'll be ok because you want to be ok for her, right?"
"But that's slow, Freddy, fighting your way through traffic."
The goal is perpetual motion.
You want greens.
But how do you ensure the greens?
You can't.
"As in life, in traffic."
So what you do is you leave yourself an out.
"At every corner, you leave yourself an alternative."
You move diagonal.
You turn the wheel when you hit a red light.
You don't drive down Broadway to get to Broadway.
If you move diagonal... you're gonna get perpetual motion.
That's what you want.
But how does this apply to what you were saying in there?
"It applies, Freddy!"
It's just as easy to tail a man walking in front of him.
"You butt heads with these friends of ours, you're gonna come at them head-on?"
- Okay.
"- They got lives, Freddy."
Families.
No.
You move diagonal.
You jag.
Christ!
Where the fuck are you guys?
We're on our way- in 20.
I'm down.
"But Joey, he's tryin' to hold on... but this big bastard, he cut me up."
I need help!
- He's a fucking monster!
"- I need your location, Tom!"
- I need an assist.
"Iâm the one getting my ass kicked over here, itâs not you."
Horace.
"Yeah, I have children here, you don't know what that's like."
(change jingling)
"Yeah, but I'm not gonna do that."
"What are you, crazy?"
Yeah.
"No, I can't do that."
Come here.
"Go downstairs, get mama a pack of cigarettes."
"Yeah, I know, I know, I know."
"I know, Abby."
"Oh, okay."
"- Well, Little Horace, when he was about six, he was in the little league and I coached his team, right?"
"And so he played right field, so right away, you know how good he is, right?"
"I mean, how many kids that age could hit it out to right field?"
"So he'd be out there, you know, picking his nose and staring off, and then one day, he comes running up to me in the middle of the game, up to the bench, he says,"
"(high pitched) Uncle Pete, Uncle Pete,"
I gotta make a pee pee!
"I said, get the fuck back out on the field!"
What's the matter with you?
(laughter)
"He said, (high pitched) time out, Uncle Pete, I gotta make a pee pee!"
"I said, I don't care if you gotta make a doo-doo."
You don't stop in the middle of the game.
What are you doing?
"What is this, girls' softball?"
"And then he's crying like, wahh..."
"All right, all right, I had to call a time-out."
"So I say to the ump, time out."
"And then I go over to Horace, I said, okay, all right, come here."
"Here, come here."
You've done a lot of shopping today.
"These days we're playing tag again... with the tax agents, to avoid any delays."
True.
We have to solve the problem... one way or another.
How much do we owe them?
200 million!
Is that the total?
What's our cash flow?
75 million!
I'll ask Djénéba to write a check.
"It's always better... to pay off debts to the state, so we can make projects... in the best conditions."
Put the money away!
Write a check for 125 million.
I don't have so much money in the bank.
It's not about your bank account.
Is it you who feeds him?
No use complaining.
Do as you're told.
You're unbearable.
I can't take it any longer!
Just leave if you can't take it!
"Sissoko, calm down."
What do you want me to do?
My woman treats me like a nobody.
You don't have to spit on me... every time you get into debt.
Leave me alone!
"If you don't do it, I'll beat you up."
Too much anger... for just one man.
"By God and Sinaté, I forgive you."
I've had enough.
"Here, Sinaté."
"Djénéba, give us five minutes."
"God, that girl."
Is this whole house falling apart?
[SIGHS]
Oh!
"Christine, what are you...?"
Get off of me.
Just forget the sangria.
Bring some wine.
"Uh, Marly."
"You know, I don't work for you."
And I quit.
What?
"You know, I have been such a good sport up until now."
"But, I mean, I'm getting really tired of you and your friends looking down on me."
Why would we look down on you?
Since you came to this school the only person you've had something in common with is my maid.
"You know, uh, I could say something right now that would really hurt you too."
But I'm not gonna do that.
Because I'm a much nicer person than that.
You're too tan.
You know what would be great?
"If you could stop judging me for, like, a minute and give me a break."
Me judging you?
"Yeah, look, you've got it easy, okay?"
You don't care what people think about you.
You don't try to impress people with your car or your marriage.
Your clothes.
"I mean, you cut your own hair."
I don't cut my own hair.
This cost 60 bucks.
"Okay, you don't spend a lot of money on your hair."
The point is you seem very comfortable with yourself.
Out here?
-Help me!
Help me get her in.
"Okay, come on."
"Come on, come on, come on."
What happened?
-ls she dead?
-She will be if you don't hurry the fuck up.
I understand that. I'm not a fool.
"You understand that, you're not a fool."
Who are you working for?
(breathing LOUDLY)
I used to work for the same righteous pricks who twisted your life.
Now I work for the other side.
Just as twisted but they pay a lot more.
"They break us, you know."
Turn us into these awful things.
Broken pieces.
They push us.
Make us into men we're not.
And then complain when we no longer function.
They think we should live like this is normal.
"Like this is how we should behave, how we should think."
And our reward for this life?
We try to run away and they kill us because of what they forced inside our heads.
You think men like that deserve to live?
They deserve everything they got coming.
Maybe.
Did you stop the broadcasts?
Yeah.
Why?
Some fleeting virtue in not being a mass murderer.
We're doing it the Tommo way.
Now we know how to make camp fires.
"Louis, you idiot!"
Right.
I think we'II just burn it like that now.
"Do you think if one of us wasn't in the band, though, the band would be this big?"
-No.
-No.
definitely not.
I don't think so either.
I think we each balance each other out.
Yeah.
"I think when we look back at this no matter what we do after this, we'II never, ever beat this."
"Yeah, but isn't that scary?"
-If the best times of your life are now...
-Don't you think it's a bit...
-...that's crazy.
"-...of a Benjamin Button thing, though?"
That we get to do it backwards.
Do you know what I mean?
"We get to go after this and then have a proper, normal life."
"Just have, Iike, a wife and kids."
Do you know what I mean?
Don't you think that's quite nice?
That's what I Iook forward to if I Iook forward to anything.
What's mad is that one day we won't be doing this.
-I know.
-Yeah.
"So do you think, Iike we're still gonna be mates?"
"-I think so, yeah."
-I think we will as well.
Do you want my e-maiI now or shall I give it to you later?
What are you doing here?
Who would have thought of seeing you?
"I was just writing to you Come in, sit down I , er"
"I've nothing to offer you but myself, I'm afraid"
That's all we wanted Well
So what were you writing?
May we read it?
"Oh, no need"
You can read it in the room
It's all up with me here
"If you'd have come an hour or two later, I'd have been gone"
"Yes, I'm selling out That's the end of another career"
Is it really as hopeless as that?
It is
"I'm so near disgrace here, they'd rather be rid of me"
And it's not just the debts
"Wait, maybe when you come back, we should just sit down and talk."
Just the three of us.
What do you think?
"You want us to come with you, Dad?"
No!
"I mean, I have to do this myself."
We really gonna talk?
I brought a six-pack.
"If things go south, we can just watch the game."
You want to laugh?
That last box of stuff that Dad packed into his car was my stuff.
No way.
Oh no.
I didn't have the heart to tell him.
"Hey, you know, I don't have a problem with hugging."
"I mean, I don't."
"Before, I only ate my sister's leftovers."
Why?
"My mother remarried, and I was like the third wheel."
She pandered to my new father.
"Once she had his kid, she completely ignored me."
"She didn't feed me, so I ate leftover rice in the wee hours."
I felt like a ghost.
Are you serious?
"Yeah, she didn't even take me on family trips."
You don't have to believe me.
So you ran away from that.
I abandoned her.
I stopped going home and started staying out with friends.
"Not really friends, but just people to hang out with."
"One day I came home late at night, and my mother said to me,"
"""Would you please just die?"""
"No way, I just couldn't take it anymore."
There's a threshold for how much we can endure.
So I packed my stuff and left.
You see...
"Because I was told to die, I refuse to."
"I'll sell my body if I have to, I'm gonna survive no matter what."
Aren't we doing it?
"No, we're not."
Then what's that on my back?
The body has its own ideas.
"You know, I've never done it with someone I like."
My first was with an old bald guy.
I see.
I want to.
Thank you.
What happened to work?
We're still looking.
I'll send you a copy of the report when I get one.
"Hey, tell your father not to be such a stranger."
I'm forgetting how ugly his mug is.
You're lucky you didn't get his looks.
"Oh, shit."
So you're telling me your sister is on a TV that is completely cut off from any sort of signal?
"Yes, that is why I need to call her now."
"- Anna, you know it's against the rules."
Only one 5-minute call at the end of each day.
"You know, it's easier to just deliberate and get it over with then to try to get out of it."
"If I tell the judge you think people are trying to talk to you through a TV that's not even connected, what do you think she's going to say?"
You're right.
"Look, Anna, I know it sucks being down here, but look at the bright side."
Maybe you'll make a friend or two.
Hey.
Sorry I'm late.
"- No, menstrual cycles are late, lawyers are on time."
"Time is money, isn't that right?"
Yeah.
It's 7:30 in the morning.
"It's 7:51, actually."
Hi.
"Can I get you a drink, sir?"
- Coffee.
He'll have a Bud.
I'll have coffee.
And he's had enough.
This is my first.
"Right, Danielle?"
Just messing with you.
Why do you do that?
You are bankrupt.
We're living in misery and he dishonours us.
You even sold your gold teeth.
People are laughing at us.
We were taken to the police.
"People make fun of us on the streets, in the mosques..."
"I'd give you another son right now, but it takes a real man."
I gave you a son and a daughter.
Your son didn't turn out to be a man.
"Stop this nonsense, Kezban."
God damn you...
You faggot.
He took after you.
What have you got here?
You're weak and mute.
"God, damn you!"
You have no pride.
"You have no dignity, no honour."
Look at your honour...
It's being trampled on.
You're an absolute disgrace.
It's my conscience that stops me.
Do you think I am not sad?
Traditions matter more than our conscience.
"Go ahead, hide in the barn, cover your head."
I told you when he was a little boy to get rid of the Zenne then.
You paid no heed.
God forgive us for what we've done or are about to do.
I can not act until I have concrete proof.
"We believe in the same God, Kezban."
He will whisper to me.
I wish you'd stay.
Some sort of serrano thing for Brooke?
- Why would I do that?
"- Well, I asked you first"
"Look, don't underestimate Brooke."
She's full of surprises.
Its just part of her charm.
She told me to listen to track 13.
There are only 12 songs.
Honest mistake.
"Yeah, I guess."
"Anyway, sorry about this morning with your dad."
I had no idea he was there.
It's cause he usually isn't.
I thought you were happy with your setup.
That's what I tell him.
"I make up stuff in the emails I send him about how happy I am being on my own, and how responsible I'm being even when I'm not."
"He loves his job, you know?"
"And after my mom died, it's just not fair to ask him to give that up."
But I miss him when he's away.
You tell him that?
He worries.
It's just better not to.
"So listen, I don't have a lot of quiet time these days."
You mind if I just sit and read while you draw?
As long as you don't act out the parts.
Alright.
My mom said you wanted to see me.
Yeah.
"Hand me that ratchet, would you?"
So how are you holding up?
Why?
Are you going to report it back to my mom?
So now I'm gonna take care of it!
"No, you will not."
You will have your boys sweep every room in this place.
"And you will come with me, as planned."
Find him.
You don't talk to me like that in front of my men.
"- I don't, huh?"
"- No, you don't!"
Ten years I've known Bobby!
Twice the guy saved my life.
This doesn't go unanswered!
"Drop the tough-guy shit with me, junior."
"Now, I know your story, Emil."
I know what this country did to you.
We're in this together.
So be calm.
- I'm calm.
- Good.
- I'm still gonna kill him.
- I don't have a problem with that.
But I need the president alive.
Don't forget that.
You promised me the leader of the free world.
Don't you worry your pretty little head.
We'll get him back.
"But without him, what kind of time frame we looking at?"
"We have 15 minutes to load in, then maybe another 3O or so to crack the protocols without his code."
"After that, it's on you."
- What about securing the basement?
- I brought a party favour for that.
- Good.
- Do you know you've got a bit of something right...
She doesn't know that it looks as though he was alive when he was buried.
Does she need to know that?
She's asked to see the body.
"Well, you should do your best to put her off."
"Well, you can't stop her if she wants to see him."
Some people don't believe it until they see it.
I know.
But it's her son in there.
I think maybe I should do this.
Sure?
Just don't let her see the body.
"Oh, please."
No.
Not David.
I'm sorry.
Who did this?
We hope to find out more from the post-mortem.
Can I see him?
"You have the right to, of course, but I'd advise you not to."
Many changes have occurred to the body.
"He was my baby, my boy."
"From what I've read of David's work, he had a strong belief that death was not the end."
"You did well there, Nikki."
I remembered that stuff about the resurrection of the body from my gran's funeral.
Wouldn't want too many resurrections of the body.
We'd be out of a job.
I worry about you.
You'll be speaking in tongues next.
"When are you going to accept the truth, sinner?"
I wish I could find some truth right now.
Still looking for a reason?
I'm not sure there is a reason.
- to save your family.
- And I would not wish the pain of that failure upon anyone.
I would rather live with that pain than this.
"And that's just the thing, Sara."
"Look, if you were able to try to save Laurel, then you wouldn't be alive at all."
Then fine.
I don't care.
"When we left, when I recruited you, we... we... we altered the timeline."
"Now had it remained the same, then Damien Darhk would have..."
He would have killed not only you and...
"and your sister, but your father as well."
"But, Rip, if... if we go back, and we take the team..."
The outcome would be exactly the same.
You don't know that.
- I'm afraid that I do.
- No.
I...
There's got to be a way.
"Rip, I have to be able to do something."
I'm so sorry.
"Look, I can't."
Can't do this without my sister.
- I can't.
"- Yes, you can."
"You are one of the strongest people I have ever met, Sara."
Laurel...
"Laurel may be beyond your saving, but Kendra and Carter, they might not be."
"Captain, we are prepared to make the time jump to 1944."
"We're on our way, Gideon."
We've arrived in Saint-Lô.
"No sign of Kendra yet, but I have located"
"Vandal Savage, and he does not seem to be alone."
Give it up for...
The amazing Mr Lifto
"It's not my call but for security reasons, you guys have to leave there."
It's all good...
"Dude, that was my beer."
This song's about.... fucking...
I'm drunk.
And right now I'm so (in love with you).
And I (don't want to think too much about what we...) ...should or shouldn't do.
"Lay my hands on heaven and the sun and the moon and the stars,"
While the devil wants to fuck me in the back of his car.
Nothing quite like the feel... of something new.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up in you.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up in you.
This is the only time I really feel alive.
This is the only time I really feel...
Thanks man.
"What did you throw up, man, what did you throw?"
Can I have a towel in exchange?
Thanks man...
I swear.
Right now I found everything I need.
"The sweat in your eyes, the blood in your veins... are listening to me."
Well I want to drink it up and swim in it until I drown.
My moral standing is lying down.
Nothing quite like the feel... of something new.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
"- I'll be there, but I can't ask you."
- Why not?
"Well, my mother."
Your mother.
"Well, she wouldn't actually forbid it."
It's just that she gets jealous of anybody at all that I spend my time with.
You don't know her.
You don't have to live with her.
But she's my mother.
There's nothing I can do about that.
"You don't have to tell me any more, Norman."
"Please, Allison, I've gotta tell somebody."
She won't let me have friends.
She... .
She makes me tell her 10 times a day how much I love her.
She's afraid she'll die alone in a poorhouse.
And marriage... .
"Marriage, she says, is misery."
And a woman can only cause me trouble.
"Oh, Norman, I can't believe it."
Nobody would.
"Now maybe you know why I hate to go home and why I live in the library and why I can't dance, or kiss girls, or look anybody in the eye."
"You see, I'm a sissy and a coward."
"No, you're not, Norman."
No one around town stopped to think and give you a chance.
You shouldn't be afraid of girls.
"I know, but I am, and I don't know what I can do about it."
- I know what you can do.
- What?
You can start with me.
I'll prove everything your mother ever said was wrong.
"Would you kiss me, Norman?"
Jing-Mei was first on the scene.
- Is she okay?
- A little freaked.
"I don't get it, man, how you could just roll over."
- That's the way it works sometimes.
"- Yeah, if you let it."
"- What are you gonna do, file a lawsuit?"
- That's one way to fight it.
- There is no fighting it.
"- You know, I don't buy that."
Carter wants the output on Bed 4 before he leaves.
"Look, we could be perfect, you know, like Gandhi."
"But as soon as the crap goes down, we'll be the first ones laid out with a gun to our head."
"Now, where I grew up, you see it every day."
"And if it happens to you enough, you get the message."
You are not equal.
You are not a full citizen.
"You are first, last and, above all, one thing and one thing only:"
A suspect.
You sure you wanna wait out here?
"Yeah, there's too many sick people in there."
- Thanks.
- You' re welcome.
Hey.
Cold enough for you?
My mom went ahead to help set up stuff for the home hospice team.
- Then she'll be coming to pick me up.
- I think you' re doing the right thing.
I think it doesn't matter what you think.
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I'm so pissed at you.
Guess it all just feels so much more real now.
Yeah?
"For years, I've been cheating on you."
"Well, I cheated on you with more than one guy!"
With two...
You had a three-way with two dudes?
"No, no!"
But I would have!
I totally would have!
"Well, I would've, too!"
Not with two dudes!
You know what I'm talking about!
"I thought I needed to know what it was like out there, in a real way, not like I read it in Cosmo."
So I went out there and I lived it.
I've had one-night stands!
Okay.
I've woken up in beds with men whose names I didn't even remember!
"I was like, ""'How did I get this T-shirt on?"
",'"
"Jennifer, I get it."
Land your plane.
Just deal with it!
You deal with it.
You deal...
You deal with going to Applebee's alone.
What?
"If you don't put in effort, you're gonna be the one who ends up at Applebee's alone."
Are you asking me to go to Applebee's with you?
The bottom line is that none of them made me feel the love that you did.
And I had to go out into the world in order for me to come back and say that I belong home.
Now I'm gonna keep on spinning these fly tunes until somebody gets something going on!
I'm not saying I wouldn't go to Applebee's with you!
"Well, I'm not saying I wouldn't go to Applebee's with you!"
I feel good.
I feel normal.
Okay.
"Stand up, slowly."
Are you ready to play?
Isn't this the Harlech Shadow house?
It's part of the estate.
"The gamekeeper's lodge, actually."
"But, yeah, this was the model."
The layout was replicated for the game and the texture scanned.
Wow!
"Very, very cool."
"So what's the game, what do I do?"
You don't have to do anything.
"You just stay in here alone, see how long you last until you're too scared to continue."
"So all I have to do is, like, stay here?"
And I get paid for that?
"I'll be back in the control room, watching."
"There are cameras all over, so no stealing the silverware."
And now there's this.
- And what's this?
- It's an earpiece.
Oh!
"Yeah, just pop it in, and you and I will be in contact the whole time."
"Oh, cool."
"And I can, like, talk to you, and you'll hear it?"
"Great, that's great."
"Now, nothing you'll see can physically harm you."
"It's all just audio-visual, like the gopher game."
"Oh, okay."
"But if it does get too intense, we can pull you out at any time"
- and stop the experiment.
"Hi, honey."
Didn't you have the same fight with him at breakfast?
This is the same fight as breakfast.
It's the same jar of peas and it's the same stubborn little boy who is not gonna get his own way.
"That baby thinks he is gonna break me, but he doesn't know who he's dealing with."
"Hal,"
I'm not about to lose it with a...
"God, how does he do that?"
"One, two, three, go!"
"Please, we have to stop."
I have to empty the blood out of my shoes again.
One last time.
"One, two, three, go!"
This is gonna be so great!
This is the answer.
What's the question?
"I don't know yet, but this is definitely the answer."
Would you look at this?
Jamie poured flour in the dryer.
Now I get to wear a loaf of bread to work tomorrow.
He destroys everything!
He's absolutely the worst kid we have ever had!
"Oh, you say that with every kid."
"Let's face it, Lois."
It's just the hand we were dealt.
God just doesn't like us.
That doesn't make us bad people.
"No, there's something different with Jamie."
He's not like the other ones.
"I'm telling you,I can see it in his eyes."
"Honey, calm down."
You know what will make you feel better?
My mother would kill me.
"What is that, a Danish?"
This is the one.
Right here.
Trees are fascinating.
They don't have to touch to propagate.
You would find that fascinating.
- How many do I need?
"- One, two, three, four..."
Why didn't I see that?
Thank you very much.
I owe you one.
Sometimes you don't see what's right in front of your face.
Six and a five.
I got you.
The pretzel!
You can have mine.
You sounded excited on the phone.
I'm going to take my theory of love as a man-made cultural creation and expand it to include the biological effect on the individual.
Greg.
You need a hobby.
"I can't believe you've dated for three months, and you haven't kissed!"
- How do you say hello?
"- Well, we nod."
It works.
You mean you haven't even touched?
"I fell down once, and he picked me up."
- We talk a lot.
That's what we do.
- About what?
"And I don't worry about what I say, what I wear, what I eat..."
It's a relief to eat with a man and not worry that he'll be frightened.
"You're digging your own graves, you fools!"
"You do what we tell you, or you're digging yours."
[MEN SHOUTING]
[GUNSHOT]
"Listen, bigshot, you saw what Pollard just got, so order them gates to open up and take us to the car, or I'll blow your hair all over the ceiling."
"You haven't got the nerve, Dale."
You can't get away with this.
You'll spend the rest of your life in the Hole.
You got 10 seconds to find out whether I got the nerve.
"Ten seconds or 10 years, the answer will always be the same."
"Listen, you dirty rats in there."
"If these gates ain't open in 10 seconds,"
I'm killing Armstrong just like Pollard!
"Is that right, warden?"
Did they kill Pollard?
Never mind.
Don't open the gates.
Get on the phone.
Call for extra help.
"We have, warden."
"It's on the way, sir."
"This is it, Armstrong."
Don't you need the warden to make 'em open up the solitary?
"Yeah, yeah, that's right."
"I oughta give it to you now, but I got a date to keep with Stacey, and you're opening it up for him."
You're heading for the Hole.
Not a chance.
[MEN CHEERING]
"Get them keys, or I give it to Lang on the spot!"
"All right, men, all right!"
All right!
I'll open up.
"they keep asking about you, what you know."
What's wrong?
Cut me loose.
I know where the Ark is Marion.
The Ark is here?
Well I'm coming with you Jones!
"Get me out of here, Cut me loose!"
You can't leave me here!
If I take you out of here now they will start combing the place for us.
Jones you got to get me out of here!
Are you crazy?
You know that I hate to do this.
"You just Sit still, keep quiet."
This whole thing is going to be shut.
I'll be back to get you.
That's it.
"Who knows, perhaps the Ark is still waiting in some anti chamber for us to discover."
Perhaps it's some vital bit of evidence which eludes us.
Perhaps the girl can help us.
My feeling exactly.
"She was in possession of the original piece for years, she may know much if properly motivated."
I tell you the girl knows nothing.
I'm surprised to find you squeamish that is not your reputation.
"But it needn't concern you, I have the perfect man for this kind of work."
Heil Hitler.
Indy!
Here!
We hit stone!
Clear it off.
Come on find the edges.
"Good, good, good."
You see Indy?
Why's she so important?
Because she's a perfect duplication of human DNA in ice crystal form.
The ultimate fusion of snow and humanity.
"To live here, the snow needs to evolve - and she's the blueprint."
She's what they need to become.
"When the snow melted last night, did the pond?"
No.
Living ice that will never melt.
"If the snow gets hold of that creature on the stairs, it will learn to make more of them."
It will build an army of ice.
And it will be the last day of humanity on this planet.
Stay here.
"Oi, I told you to stay in there."
"Oh, I didn't listen."
You do that a lot.
It's why you like me.
Who said I like you?
Argh!
I think you just did.
You kissed me.
You blushed.
And we just...
Shut up.
Argh!
Release her to us.
You have five minutes.
We need to get her out of here - but keep her away from them.
How?
With this - do I always have to state the obvious?
"Those creatures outside, what are they?"
"No danger to you, as long as I get that thing out of here!"
"You, in there - now."
# Now stand by with your glasses All ready
# Drink a health to the men Of the skies... #
"Here's to the memory of a fine, brave man."
I remember the smile on his face as he went.
"What you trying to do, turn this into a wake?"
"If you two girls go and sit over there, I'll get your drinks."
"""Easy as falling off a log"" he said."
"Look, he made 88 jumps, the odds caught up with him."
"Look, he made 88 jumps, the odds caught up with him."
Because he was a right guy.
He'd tell you to drink that beer instead of crying into it.
Let's have a game of darts.
You two go ahead.
I'm all right.
"I don't care for darts, maybe it'll make him more cheerful."
May I sit down?
It's a free country.
"Wow, that's a rousing welcome."
What did you expect a 21-gun salute?
"Make it 48, will you?"
I heard about this morning.
About Breton.
Let's talk about something else.
I was wrong about you.
I thought you were like the others.
Scared inside and covering up.
"But you're not scared, are you?"
Sure I am.
No you're not.
You know what they say around here?
There are two types of men who jump.
Those who are crazy and those who are scared.
Where's Danny?
- Danny just left.
- Ah.
Damn it.
- And wait for it.
"Hey, I just got your text that Justin is here."
I also saw him run right past me.
Which one should I trust?
"Yeah, I know."
I love you.
I have to tell you this.
And I know you don't like this sappy stuff.
You're going to act like you don't care.
Alright you know what?
"Look, stop."
"Let me go first, OK?"
It's only fair.
"Shelly, why don't you tell him where I was while I go wash up?"
"Oh, I'd love to."
"Gather around, everybody, and hear the tale."
Now when I told Danny we couldn't get your ring back... he took it upon himself to go back to the strip club and get it from Trent.
"But when he got there,"
Trent and Kevin were so nervous because there was some big league stripper scouts there from the biggest area in the world.
"That's right, Will, Tampa."
You know about this Will.
I know you.
I seen you at the club.
"Now the problem was that they didn't have a third dancer, and what happened next, oh, is gonna go down in male stripper history."
Wow.
"Guys, if we die tonight, I just want the world to know we died doing what we love."
Yeah.
"I don't really want the world or anyone to ever know that I was here, but."
Do you know how many married men hit on me in a week?
No tell us.
I don't really know the exact number but it's figgin high.
At least this is what I tell myself.
Come on guys let's go.
All I know for certain is that dating in this city sucks and I'm dying.
Thank you.
"I'm serious, I'm done."
You guys don't hate me but I might pass on going out tonight.
What?
"No, no you are going."
You just got out of a crappy relationship and you are single.
Plus you our designated driver.
Thanks a lot for the guilt.
Going out in LA isn't quite like it is in any other city.
Because of the whole who's who factor... that this place evolves around.
So unless you're an A List B List or C List celebrity... work in the A List... arena or you're a friend of the club Jonathan slash door Nazi then... yeah it's pretty much impossible to get in.
Bottom line there are three major questions in Hollywood.
Who are you?
What do you do?
And who are your friends?
If you are not on the list leave.
"Oh, honey not in my club."
Natural hair colors only.
Anthony!
"Oh, hi."
Of course come on in.
"Great, Jonathan's working the door."
"Sorry, ladies, we're full."
Seven really?
You want in my club?
I texted you three times last three three times!
God forgives.
Pray for him to teach you how.
I don't pray any more.
I used to.
"I used to pray for answers - a clue, a sign of what I should do, how to find something precious in this life."
"There was a time when I thought it was my job, but is it?"
Nothing in this world changes because of what I do.
The hurt goes on and on.
God has...
God has given up on us.
"He doesn't hear us any more, sister."
Do you have a family?
"Yes, a wife, yes."
Do you love your wife?
"Yes, very much."
Is she precious to you?
Yes.
Then I'd say God is listening.
Nice place.
Classy and clean is the goal.
That's our goal.
"Keep it clean, sanitary, immaculate, so you'd be able to eat off the floor."
You wouldn't find food on the floor.
Not that you'd eat it if you did.
That's how clean it is.
This desirous establishment is one that'll attract
- nothing but the best clientele.
- Not to mean that we'll be elitist.
"No, sir."
"No back room VIP lounge just for the likes of Devo, Sabo and Bull."
This bar is for the working class guy.
"Like us, like you."
Tell me where you saw him.
"On a slab in the morgue, burned to a crisp."
I think we'd better sit down.
Her whole body had gone soft when I slugged her with it.
"But I kept thinking, she has to know something."
Take a couple of deep drags.
Thanks.
I won't do that again.
Tell me what happened.
"Please, I promise--"
"You're not feeling ill, Mrs. Chandler?"
"No, I feel fine, thanks."
It isn't often we have the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Chandler dance.
"Mr. Murdock, this is Mr. Martinelli, who owns all this."
Mr. Murdock's an old f riend.
Any f riend of Mrs. Chandler's is welcome.
I'm af raid i don't sing.
Perhaps you'd like to try a little roulette.
"It's not wise to tell you, but the house is having a streak of bad luck."
Mrs. Chandler doesn't feel like gambling.
"Oh, I'm all right, really I am."
I'd like to.
"You too, sir?"
I'll just watch.
Roulette wheels have a way of running over me.
I was walking into something.
"We were going to gamble, win or lose."
"He hadn't asked her to, he'd told her she had to. lt was an order, but why?"
I didn't like the feeling I had about her.
The way I wanted to put my hand on her arm.
The way I kept smelling that jasmine in her hair.
The way I kept hearing that song she'd sung.
What you've got to ask yourself is do you think I won't do it?
That's the only thing that should be on your mind.
Do you think that I won't do it?
All right.
"Next time we play chicken, I'll make sure the stakes are worth it."
There's some goody bags in your room - and other essentials.
- Are you going to tell me who you are?
"- You'll have to wait till tomorrow, now."
That one.
I've always thought scarlet suited you best.
It's red.
And don't be so cheeky.
Are you bursting with curiosity about the new recruit?
Yeah.
When do I get to meet him?
"Oh, no - when you decide the time is right."
- You know me so well.
- He's not gonna do a runner?
"No, he's not that stupid."
- So when do you put him to work?
- I do happen to have a case for him.
Good.
"Well, let's go eat and you can tell me all about the mysterious John Mercer."
- How's the cat?
"- What cat would that be, Calum?"
The one in them science books you was always reading in prison.
Is the cat dead?
Is it not dead?
Is it both dead and not dead?
- You remember that?
- It was clever shit.
"But that was always your reputation, right?"
"First off, I'm on my own after college, which is why I work so hard, and why I take opportunities when they come my way."
Not all of us get to live off a trust fund for the rest of our lives.
I'm not gonna be able to do that either.
Of course you are.
No.
My dad told me earlier.
He lost everything.
So I'm giving him my trust fund.
Why didn't you tell me this was going on?
Because I was embarrassed.
You're right.
I've never had to worry about money.
I feel stupid even complaining about it.
"I mean, other people have real problems."
"Sebastian, this is real."
And you shouldn't feel bad talking about it.
Are you sure you want to give your trust fund to him?
I don't think I can abandon him.
I guess I just don't have that killer instinct.
Aren't you worried he's gonna lose the money?
Yes.
But you're still gonna give it to him?
"Well, I already invested $25,000 in the company."
Too late to get that back.
But...
"Yeah, I'll give the rest to him."
"I mean, it's his money anyway."
He made it.
What will you do?
Will you have to move out?
I don't know.
"I mean, this place is rent-controlled."
We're talking here.
"Who's, uh, who's slow joel?"
"You know joel.He comes by the house a couple times a year.He's got the pushed-in nose, scars under the eyes."
Wears the pull-down wool cap.
Talks like marlee matlin.
"Oh.Oh, that guy is jolting' joel johansson?"
"Was joltin' joel, is slow joel."
"Hey, it's not my fault he kept dropping his goddamn hands like sugar ray leonard."
The guy was an ape trying to be a hot dog.
"But you're smarter than that, franco.You can move."
And lou made a lot of money with jolting' joel.
"I mean, the side action on these fights are over the moon."
Yeah.
And now he shits his pants twice a day.
"Tommy, why don't you go be a pain in the ass somewhere else?"
We're talking here.
Ok.Don't forget to mention the glass eye.
"Uh, the what?"
"It's totally unrelated.He got excited, hit himself in the face with a fork."
Joel loved a good meal.
What do you think?
"I don't know, guys."
"I've been in the ring before, you know, lou."
Think I'll just stick to hitting the heavy bag.
Bag don't hit back if you know what i mean.
"Ah, come on.I'm serious here, franco, you got real talent."
This could be huge with the right guidance.
"Yeah.Well, you know, I'm just not to keen on messing with the catnip, you know."
End up looking like mickey rourke.
He looked good in sin city.
He was animated.
"Look, franc, man was not meant to hit 80 pounds of sand hanging from a ceiling."
"Until I touch their corpses with my own hands,"
I won't believe they are dead!
Where do you expect them to be?
"They're dead, I tell you."
It's as if I can see them.
I can feel them watching me.
Their spirit is searching my head to find me.
Their hatred won't leave me!
I know theywill return.
They can think of nothing else but me.
They're looking for me in order to take their revenge.
"Dead or alive, I know they will be back."
I know they will be back.
I saw them in the tavern!
They were covered in blood.
They were watching me.
"You don't care, do you?"
You weren't there.
You don't believe in ghosts!
You're nothing but a trollop.
No.
"No, you can't make me forget them."
They will kill us!
They came back from the dead... to tear us apart.
Good for them if they are alive!
I will kill them like wicked creatures.
I want to strangle them.
I want to feel their bones breaking between my fingers.
"I want to overpower them, drink their blood and wounds."
I'll smash them with my heels and you'll be there to see it.
There will be nothing left of them
Nothing!
So we just make it all nice.
"Everything's easy, fun, we're drinking, we're smiling."
Okay?
We can't leave till sundown.
"Guys, we all need to be together first thing in the morning, okay?"
Which is exactly why we have to find Trudy.
"Otherwise, we won't all be there."
Let's get out of here now.
"Reconvene later at the beach, at 1900 hours."
You with me?
"Joey, we are not gonna be able to finish the program if we get caught!"
"All right, bring it in."
"Hey, come on, Shane!"
"We walk to the other side, we get caught."
"This way, we canoe out nice and easy, we find ourselves a nice, quiet beach."
We pull up.
"We find the singles' side, we find a dance floor, we find some cocktails."
And we find Trudy and we bring her back...
"Yeah, we find Trudy and we bring her right back here."
This is crazy.
Trust me.
I was an Eagle Scout.
My mind is a compass.
I can handle these situations.
I've been trained to do so.
"Now follow me and I'm gonna get you there, but we gotta do it quick and we gotta do it quiet."
Come on.
"These are not the best laid plans, okay?"
"I'm just gonna go on record right now, okay?"
I do not think this has a high chance...
"If we keep up this pace, we'll be there in 20 minutes!"
I hope so!
"Others will come like ballerinas and I... lt's not that bad, honestly!"
Why would I say so?
It can be done!
"We'll take it in here, alter this..."
"Anyway, we must add another colour."
I don't know why I always want blue.
"We'll take it in here a bit, shorten it there, you can make it a bit wider here."
I'll buy something for you here.
I probably won't go anywhere.
"I was looking forward to it, but I'm worked up about it."
I don't know why you're so sceptical and you keep doubting.
"It's not so bad, it can be put right."
Then I'll buy you a lovely dress.
I don't know what you want to alter.
I'll go in this...
"This is pretty, it's ... pique."
But it will look awful on me.
"A pleat here, blue there, elsewhere taken in, let out... I shall look ... awful."
It'll be just as I dreaded.
"Not only will I sit out, but what will I look like?"
I'm sorry.
But it's not as bad as you make out.
You always talk like that.
We're not so badly off that I can't even buy you... lt'll be better now.
It's terrible.
Pretty well the whole day.
"Once we played a bit in the morning, a bit in the afternoon..."
"Wait, we'll share it out."
"Well, okay."
"- You're wonderful, I'm waiting."
- All right.
- Where is it?

GlVING THE QUEEN A WEAKNESS TO EXPLOlT.
(horse whinnies in distance)
"SOUNDS LlKE A CURSE TO ME, AND ALL CURSES CAN BE BROKEN."
A KlSS BORNE OF TRUE LOVE WOULD DO IT.
A KlSS IS ENOUGH?
HE'D BE A MAN AGAlN?
AN ORDlNARY MAN.
BELLE'S INTENTlONS WERE PURE.
KlSS ME AGAlN.
IT'S WORKlNG.
ANY CURSE CAN BE BROKEN.
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?!
WHO KNOWS THAT?!
"RUMPLESTlLTSKlN WAS FURlOUS,"
AND HE THREW BELLE OUT OF HlS HOUSE.
"YOU'RE A COWARD, RUMPLESTlLTSKlN."
YOU COULD'VE HAD HAPPlNESS IF YOU'D JUST BELlEVE.
"I'M NOT A COWARD, DEARlE."
MY POWER MEANS MORE TO ME... (whispers) THAN YOU.
AND THE QUEEN SElZED THE OPPORTUNlTY
TO BRlNG RUMPLESTlLTSKlN DOWN.
"AFTER SHE GOT HOME, HER FATHER LOCKED HER IN A TOWER"
AND SENT IN CLERlCS TO CLEANSE HER SOUL.
"AFTER A WHlLE, SHE THREW HERSELF OFF THE TOWER."

I'M A REAL BOY!
"THEY LlVED A HAPPY LlFE,"
UNTlL THE DAY THEY LEARNED OF THE QUEEN'S POWERFUL CURSE.
THE TREE CONTAlNS ENOUGH MAGlC
TO PROTECT TWO FROM THE QUEEN'S CURSE.
GEPPETTO STRUCK A SECRET DEAL WlTH THE BLUE FAlRY...
"I WlLL BUlLD YOUR WARDROBE,"
ON ONE CONDlTION--
IF PlNOCCHlO CAN TAKE THE SECOND SPOT IN IT.
BUT IT CAME WlTH GREAT RESPONSlBILlTY.
"(Geppetto) IN 28 YEARS,"
YOU MUST MAKE SURE THE SAVlOR BELlEVES.

SO IT WAS PlNOCCHlO WHO MADE THE FlRST JOURNEY... (engines roaring) (whoosh) (baby crying)
AND HE TOOK CARE OF BABY EMMA.
"WHEN I FOUND YOU, YOU WERE WRAPPED IN A BLANKET,"
"AND THE NAME ""EMMA"" WAS EMBROlDERED"
ALONG THE BOTTOM OF IT.
YOU'RE ASKlNG ME TO BELlEVE
THAT YOU ARE A FAlRY TALE CHARACTER?
PlNOCCHlO.
HOW DOES THAT PROVE ANYTHlNG?
"YOU DON'T SEE IT, DO YOU?"
SEE WHAT?
IT'S MORE POWERFUL THAN I THOUGHT.
IT'S PREVENTlNG YOU FROM SEElNG THE TRUTH.
"OKAY, ONE OF US IS LOSlNG IT HERE, AND IT'S NOT ME."
YOU DON'T WANT TO BELlEVE.
WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT TO YOU THAT I DO?!
"BECAUSE I, THE TOWN, EVERYONE NEEDS YOU!"
I DlDN'T ASK FOR THAT!
I DON'T WANT IT!
YOU'RE OUR ONLY HOPE.
THEN YOU'RE ALL SCREWED.

REGlNA FELT HENRY SLlPPlNG FURTHER AWAY.
I THlNK IT'S TlME TO TRANSFER YOU

AND SHE GREW WEARY FROM EMMA'S PRESENCE.
MY TREE IS DYlNG.
I THlNK IT'S A SlGN OF THE CURSE WEAKENlNG.
I WANT TO STRlKE A NEW DEAL--
ONE WHERE I CAN GET RlD OF EMMA WlTHOUT SHATTERlNG THE CURSE.
GOLD HAD NO INTEREST IN ANOTHER DEAL.
"YOU NO LONGER HAVE ANYTHlNG THAT I WANT, DEARlE."
"I'D PLAN A TRlP OF YOUR OWN,"

- Hah.
"""Bad blood."""
Can you imagine what would happen if I spoiled even a tiny drop of his blood?
- All of comrade Dynin's blood just went bad!

Wow!
How about Ann?
AW:
I don't have much to add.
"It was very beautiful and the song was called ""Natural Woman"" and I thought that you really was one."
D:
So lovely
D:
"The jury agreed, Camilla, and what do you think the policeman over there think?"
CL:
"He thinks that everything I do is fantastic, so he just got another confirmation now."
D:
Do you know what I believe?
I think that the cop thought it was touching.
D:
Thanks to the jury.
Thank you so much Camilla and Kristjan.
J:
"Camilla, this is almost like a dream."
What great praise you got from the jury.
CL:
I was very tearful.
J:
Is that true?
CL:
"It's so much energy that has been used now for many weeks, and finally it went my way."
J:
She liked it.
And you get to know the people.
Both my sisters lived in Grand Rapids there.
Janet O'Donnell and who else?
Eleanor McDonough.
She's got the place in Charlevoix now.
Her husband died a couple years ago so she's got - her parents own a house over there.
"So what was the island like back then when you came back you rented first, right?"
"Oh yeah, I rented for years."
"It was okay, it was good."
"A little busy, like you say, all the time."
But you still knew more people.
"Now, know more up at the hill at the cemetery."
"Like I said, nine of us graduated in '59."
Threw a 50th party here in July.
Who were those nine that graduated together?
Four of us lived here.
"Eleanor Moony, O'Donnell's wife."
"And Beverly Cantwell, now."
"That's Richie's sister by the way, the fireman."
Myself.
And Loretta Slader.
All four of us lived here.
Then we have Caroline [?].
She was Johnny Paul's sister.
Next to another Johnny in my class.
Jeanie [?] lived next to Archie's place.
And Sally Martin
"She would be Margie, up at the old convent there."
Be Little Ernie's aunt.
"Let's see who - Jeanie, and Sally, and"
Caroline

David:
"Okay, [laughter] there are some asexual people who will masturbate."
"But I know that's like very, very difficult."
Joy: asexual
David:
"It seems counterintuitive, but yeah, thank you for saying that."
Think about it: you can like having sex with a man and not like having sex with a woman
You can like having sex with yourself and not like having sex with a partner.
Joy:
Yeah.
Star:
Wait.
"Now, you're describing something that's-"
Joy:
You didn't answer the question.
Do you like to have sex with yourself?
David:
"Oh, me, personally?"
Joy:
Yes.
David:
I've tried it.
I mean it was all right.
Joy:
It's not all that?
[laughter]
David:
Yeah.

It's not all that.

And the snogging is wicked.
Sven uses varying pressure.
That's what foreign boys do.
My parents snog occasionally.
Even at their age.
Cringey.
Seeing old people over the age of 30 snogging is just horrific.
"Of all of the boys I've ever snogged, Sven is definitely the best."
'Cause he's emotional.
Where have you got to on the snogging scale?
What?
Jas and I invented a snogging scale.

Did your mammy tell you that?
"I was not in， sister, right?"
My daddy told me I must try it by any means
Otherwise， she may become secondhand like her
Right What?
My mammy told me like that
My daddy told me like that
What now?
Well， your daddy's right， and so's your mammy
But that bloody ghost won't give up so easily

I'm taking pictures right now.
All the passersby's look incredible.
I want to ask so many of them
lf I could take pictures of them.
There are tons of people who look much better than we do
They look very modelesque.
I got this stain from a hotdog I ate earlier.
I guess I'm clumsy sometimes.
Thankfully I dropped it after I finished my scene.
Dae Hyun and Yong Guk are filming at Time Square and Central Park fountain.
It's like a dream.
When else would we come here to film for a MV!
"Right now, we are at Central Park."
We're here because Dae Hyun is filming.
He's filming for the MV right now.
And I'm just going there to watch him.
"At Central Park,"
The trees are all very tall and the air is very fresh.
Look over there.
It's a horse.
I've only seen it in NY I think.
Horses in NY!
You don't see that often elsewhere.
Horses on the streets.
This place sure is humongous.
The trees are enormous and the streets are wide.
It's one thing that stands out about America.
This place is so big I feel like I'm in a giant's forest.
Dae Hyun is a natural at acting.
This place is Central Park.
ln the middle of Central Park
I took a picture over there by the fountain.
Every time when Ahmed comes back from Somalia.
He tells terrible stories and says:
I wil never go there again.
"But he also says: when Somalia needs a president in 10 years,"
I'm ready.
"When he went there for the first time, he met relatives, that he never saw before."
And his uncle took him to the desert.
Ahmed must sleep in the desert in order to turn adult.
They go far out.
It is cold.
There is noone.
Ahmed cannot sleep.
Suddenly he hears an animal.
A lion roars nearby.
It is creeping through the camp.
Ahmed tries to wkae his uncle.
Hopefully he has his gun with him.
The uncle wakes.
"The lion roars again, and the uncles tells Ahmed, that he should not wake him up because of a lion which is 20 miles away."
This way Ahmed became a grown up person.
"The choreographer of Lion King didn't want us to imitate animal movements, as everybody does it."
But we dance the souls of the animals.
This a cow.
No.
This is a pig.
No.
A giraffe.
No.
A horse?
No.
This is a monkey.
No.
"I was good, wasn't I?"
"So, it looks like a tough assignment."
Maybe you could give me a hand.
Or maybe both hands.
"OK, those who didn't get talent positions, there's room on the crew."
Talk to Patty.
I thought my tape was really great.
"Elizabeth, some people like yourself excel at the written word."
Not everyone's meant to be an on-air personality.
There's still room on the crew.
Get it together!
We've got a show to do here.
"Enid, did you get that?"
"(Todd) Man, Patty's really trippingon this director business."
"(Patty) People, please!"
Are you feeling any better?
Not really.
You're still *The Oracle's* star writer.
No one can ever take that away from you.
"I wanted it so bad, Todd, and I thought my work was really great."
"Well, what did Collins say?"
There's nothing he can do.
"If you ask me, they should change the name from *Oracle On-Air* to *Airheads On-Air.*"
Hey...
"Present company excluded, of course."
"Hi, Liz..."
Todd.
Have you met Russ?
"Yes, I have."
"Well, just wanted to say hi."
Don't forget to watch me tomorrow.
Is it wrong to hate your sister with a passion?
No
No one smells anything
I definitely smell a chicken
"Alright, man."
I wanna clean fight Let's get it on
Wait a minute is he gonna use those gloves
What's wrong with my gloves
"Well, won't they get in the way of all the scratching and slapping? *"
You're gonna rock his world.
Punish him.
You're the man
Good luck
Come on.
Stuart
"You're like a wild animal, aren't you"
"Well, how am i supposed to fight you if you keep running around like a sissy?"
A sissy
Yeah
Is he down
How good of a friend is he?
"Actually, we're very tight, but I'm totally ok with you beating the crap out of him."
"Come on ,Dorothy"
Is that all you got? here comes one from macy's basement.
"1,2,3,4....."
Don't sweat this.
Only 14 more rounds to go. here we go!
"How are you doing, Stuart, alright."
How many fingers am I holding up?
Say two
He's fine
"Come on, Bring it"
You're not gay
"Bridge, neighbors, courage, inclusive?"
Inclusive.
OK.
Let me just take that word for you and break it down into syilables and see if it helps.
"As he got up in grades and his reading vocabulary got larger, he was faced with all these multi-syilabic words that he couldn't decode."
In- cuse?
It could be cuse.
But if this is qua?
Quis?
"Quis, good."
In- quis-a- tive.
Good.
So can you put it together?
Inquisitive.
Excellent.
OK.
Go on.
Clever.
Success.
And Adam's reading problems were affecting his spelling and writing as well.
What's your best guess with success?
How do you think it's spelled?
Good.
That's pretty close.
"By the time he got to ninth grade, he was getting no Special Ed help."
And he was really at a distinct disadvantage.
He fell apart.
He stopped going to class.
"He stopped doing his homework because, essentially, it was way beyond what he could do."
"And when Jane said, oh, he needs help, people said, you know what, if you look at his profile, he's solidly average."
There's nothing going on here.
He's not trying.
We need to stand up in that complaining all the time
If I hear one more person go
Oh my god.
I am so sick of white guys dating all of our women
I will slap you (slap) (slap) (slap) (slap)
And if an Asian girl only dates white guys
Who cares?
There's billions and billions of women
Even if you are not an Asian guy
Let this be a lesson
"You tell yourself, you are the bottom"
You are usually right!
"So,,, Shut up with that negative attitudee"
Yeah...
That's all I have to say.
So..
Byeeeee (Waving)
A Day for an Affair
- Hi.
- Hi.
-What did you do today?
- I went to the school and handed out lunch.
"-On my way home, I bought a couple of fish."
-What are you wearing?
My pajamas!
-Why are you wearing a uniform?
- I have a ceremony today.
I'm buying a cell phone today.
It's been ages since my old one broke.
A cell phone?
Your phone's right there.
You said you didn't need it anymore.
It's educational.
You'll gain skills Lindsay can only dream of.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Are you Peter Dyer?
"The man, the myth, the legend."
"- Your parents aren't here, are they?"
- No.
My hours are between 4:30 and 5:30 before they get back from work.
Any musical requests?
The right tune creates the right vibe.
Coldplay?
50 Cent?
Dido?
Inner Relaxation Mix?
Whatever.
You choose.
"Now, what kind of experience do you have?"
"Oh, loads."
You have to be completely honest so I can evaluate you accurately.
"Okay, I guess I practise a lot on the back of my hand."
"On average a person will have over 25,000 snogs in their lifetime."
"So close your eyes, relax, feel the magic."
We're going to do a standard one first.
"Wow, you're a natural."
- Really?
- Not too firm or toothy.
- That's very common with beginners.
- Great.
"Next, movement."
When I move my head in you go the other way.
The boy leads and the girl always fits in.
When are you available?
"And now, Hong has a report on today's weather."
"When you go out today, be sure to take an umbrella."
We are expecting showers today.
The rain should cool down this unseasonably early heat.
After the showers pass...
It'll rain today.
Soo-jeong
Hwi-chan!
NO ENTRY except Snow White &amp;amp;amp; 7 Dwarfs!
Help me out.
"If this keeps up, our son will be uncontrollable."
Because it keeps getting more serious!
How can you be so laid back about this?
"He's your son too, isn't he?"
All you do is accuse me of being overbearing.
"Oh, whatever!"
It's because you never seem to care about anything.
Okay.
I have an incoming call.
Let's talk at home.
"Yes, Ms. Kim."
How are you?
This is Hwi-chan's picture diary.
Take a look.
"These days especially,"
He seems to have many complaints about you.
"I'm aware that much of what he writes are lies, but..."
- I need to see my son.
"- But, he's in another class now."
"Maybe later, you should talk in a quieter environment."
Please sit down.
"- Wait, Georgia."
"- Georgia, don't go."
- Georgia!
"Georgia, what are you doing?"
You'll be late for your first day back at school.
I'm coming.
"- Georgia, Mummy wants you."
- Libby.
"Oh, flip, flipper and flipping hell!"
Excusez-moi.
C'est trés grotesque.
If you don't mind?
Oi!
Cheeky.
"Libby, stop putting Angus in the fridge."
"What do you want for breakfast, munchkin?"
Stuffed olive?
"Just because I did something so beyond the Valley of Sad City last night it doesn't give you the right, as my parents, to humiliate me further."
Today is the first day of my life as the new Georgia.
"And who is she, my little elf?"
"She's not an ""elf""."
Not a munchkin.
"She is a mature, sophisticated woman called Ms Georgia Nicolson."
"So, to celebrate the new me,"
I've decided what I want to do for my birthday party this year.
"I want a proper party in a club, with a D.J."
"You're not old enough to get into a club, never mind hire one out for a party."
"If you haven't noticed, I'm a woman now."
I wear a bra!
Bob.
Are you really trying to damage me permanently?
"There's no way that you are having a party in a club where there's drinking, and it's full of randy men."
Here it is.
That's right.
"This is the elevator at the Market Parking Garage in Roanoke, Virginia."
This elevator has been made famous right here.
Here we go.
"Here we are at six, which is burned out."
Just your basic Dover elevator.
"For all of those of you at Dover Elevators, a good brand of elevator."
Now we're gonna go back down to one.
All right.
Now it's time to go off to work.
[engine turning]
Wasn't that fun?
Gray:
You know how much strength it takes to rebel?
Ha.
"So this is a night in the life of S. Gray, man."
You know what I'm saying?
Sleeping on the coach... with nobo--
Grinding my ass off every day.
Shorties not enjoying their mother.
Man not enjoying his wife or his woman--his lady.
[baby wailing]
"Just bullshit, man."
Alpha male trapped in and locked in through religion and politics.
"Soon enough, man, my plans will all come into perfection."
[celestial choir]
[man snores]
[phone rings]
[toy rattles]
[alarm beeping]
[rooster crows]
"Catch a disease, nonsense..."
"Alright, we won't be disturbed here"
"Thank you, Loulou"
"Ohlala, I need to pee, I need to pee"
Go
Is it coming yet?
"Oh, that's good"
"Careful with the pants, though"
"Stop talking to me, you're distracting me!"
It's coming alright?
"Yes, it is!"
"Great, byyyeeeee"
"No, Jean!"
"Stop, Jean, stop!"
It's been a long time since we last went to a club!
Huh?
"I was saying, it's been a long time since we last went to a club!"
Yeah yeah
"Brings back memories, hmm?"
Yeah yeah
Which memories does it bring back?
Yeah!
Alright well I'm going to hit on every guy here and sleep with the first one I meet
"Jean, go screw yourself!"
Cool
"But, Loulou, can you hear what I'm saying?"
"Yeah, yeah, you told me to go screw myself and that you were gonna sleep with the first guy you meet"
"Alex, just because the music is loud doesn't mean what you're saying suddenly became interesting, you see?"
It's boring
Do you have a mint?
Want one?
"No, that's for you"
Look.
What's he doing?
- What..
"Everything's lost, Kanji."
Only thing left is this Godrej safe.
Rolex.
It's a Rolex.
- Nah.
Mr. Dinesh. lsn't that a Rolex watch you're wearing?
Must be worth 1.5 -2 lakhs.
It's worth 10.
Mr. Kanji.
I am sure you read the terms and conditions.. ..before reading the policy.
"Not at all, sir."
Your officer asked me to sign at the places marked.. ..and I did so.
How irresponsible you are.
"What happened, sir?"
"Your policy insures you against.. ..accidents like theft, fire, fraud."
Right.
That's what we opted for.
But not against Act of God.
Act of God?
"See, it's written here clearly."
Conditions apply.
My glasses.. - ln the event of loss or damage to the property.. ..the insurance company is not liable to pay.. ..any amount if the damage is caused by act of God.
And here are your signatures.
It's written in such small letters.
And nobody reads that.
What is 'Act of God'?
lncidents that are not caused by humans.
Like?
"- Like earthquake, Tsunami, Thunder."
Hey!
Do something about this bag...
"I packed, but I'm not sure."
"Take a look, hyung-nim."
That's alright.
I will be back real soon.
I will buy the things that I need.
"By the way, what is going on?"
Why suddenly..?
I don't know.
"Get going. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The phone is turned off, you will be linked to voice mail after the beep."
Her phone is turned off.
Who?
Man Ok.
Stylist Jang.
"Today, she went with Tae Ik for a scheduled radio broadcast."
Radio?
Why does the stylist have to go along for radio?
Today is a live-broadcast radio.
"Last time, Tae Ik went dressed in anything and around fifty thousand malicious comments were posted."
"""A Date in the Middle of the Day""."
"Today's guest is the cool guy from &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Take One&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;, Lee Tae Ik."
We will shortly come to you with live radio.
Commercial!
"Your style is fabulous today, Tae Ik."
Am I okay?
Good.
[In Korean].
Good [In English] 5 seconds before we air.
Stand by.

The police are searching everywhere.
Anything can happen in the future!
Even thieves should be honest! shekhar!

A big deal!

"What""s the message?"
"Gold worth crores are coming to lndia from Bangkok. very good! chhota sheikh, very good!"

Talk about the deal with me.
- How can l?
"lts syndicate""s rule that the deal.. ..should be discussed only with Tiger."
Goodbye!

Ahmed from the Bank
Hello?
Yes Mr.Ahmed
What?
When did this happen?
Okay Mr.Ahmed
I'll pass by
Thanks
What's wrong?
Dad took all his belongings from the bank
What?
"I don't know, let's go where to?"
To see why dad did this
Mr.Sameh
What's wrong?
I wanted to tell you something before you go
Just say it!
I entered the room and saw him in the bathroom
"His bag was open, I don't know why, and I found a lot of contracts and papers and thought I should tell you"
What contracts?
Donating the car and this house after he dies and he's gonna sell our land
Oh god!
And when did he do that?
The dates took place the same period when he was gone
And where are these contracts?
Upstairs in his bag
What have we ever done to deserve this?
Where is he now?
Upstairs
No...we need to put an end to this
Come on lets go
"They probably make it up just to make people afraid of it,"
'cause they're mean.
I like it because it's so scary.
It's so fascinating about the whole mythology stuff about it.
"There's mystery behind it,"
"'cause you don't know if it's real or not, kinda like Bigfoot."
It's a whole community.
People can talk about it together and whatever.
I think it's a way for people to connect.
"(Finebros) One of the main things people do with this game is they'll film themselves playing it, and then upload their reaction to the Internet."
"So, we're gonna show you a quick montage of people playing ""Slender."""
(man in video) ...just to get me.
"Oh, dude, it's safe."
Safe.
- Aah!
"Oh, my goodness."
"- God, scared me."
(people in video screaming) (laughs)
"- Destiny, please."
"- Tobuscus, yeah."
- Aah!
What the hell?!
No!
- (laughs) I feel you.
- (groaning) - PewDie-- PewDiePie.
- (screams) - (gasps)
I'm happy these people reacted worse than I did.
"(man in video) Oh, God."
Open the (bleep) door!
- (laughs) - What the (bleep)?
What is this?
- (screaming) - His head.
"Well, let me say first of all thank you for haveing my mama at the White House [oh, yeah] for the Easter, that was a beautiful event and she was so [applause] and she was so thrilled to be there."
It was great having her [applause] she's terrific

It was my mother's dying wish.. ..to take the entire 'Bhajan Mandli' group along with their family.. ..on a trip to Badrinath.
Please do come.
Of course.
Please join us on the trip.. ..and pray for my mother's soul.
My mother.
Why do souls become restless after they die?
"I mean, once you're dead it's the end of all problems."
Why become restless?
That's not it.
Suppose the deceased has a unfulfilled wish.
Then his son will fulfil it.
You won't go on the trip.
Get that.
Her mother was in the hospital for two years.
And he didn't even come take a look.
He was making dollars in America.
This charade is for the world.
Not for his mother's soul.
Don't plan the plan if you can't follow through.
All that matters is taking matters into your own hands.
Soon I'll control everything.
Hey!
Hey!
My wish is your command!
Stand back everyone!
Nothing here to see!
The rest are for you Okay?
Damn you!
Landal， what are you doing?
He said...
No， he taught me to play the piano， but I failed
I'll take my leave
Lisa， he...
I forgot to say goodbye to you
Thank you.
Come and drink soup some other day
Outrageous!
I'll win her over for sure
Landal， what are you doing the whole night?
Go and see a doctor tomorrow
What're you doing?
I told you to my underpants but you're watching the landscape
Appear before me when I count up to three 1， 2， 3
Sister wants you to go down to have dinner
Your potbelly is protruding
Let me take you somewhere to reduce weight
I'm hefty
What's wrong?
"Sister, you've been beaten out of shape."
Go now
So sorry
But
I'll buy tuna sashimi if you come.
The best kind
The best!
I'm dying for fresh tuna
I'm sorry
I'm really sorry
She never went out once with us in over a year
She's a Hikikomori
- She doesn't shut herself at home - Someday she will
"- We're having tuna, right?"
"- No, sausages"
You can't mess with tuna like that!
Come on!
I want tuna!
The best!
"I'll buy tuna, then!"
"A big can, that is"
Roll it around
"Happy birthday, Sweetie I sent a gift"
What Mom?
- A husband - What?
I signed you up at a marriage agency to meet men
You didn't have to do that
How's work?
When will you become a magician?
It's just a part-time job
How's everything there?
Good
Great air and nice people
It's so beautiful here
"Recently, thoughts of you just fill my head."
That's what I wanted to say. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Dad!
What?
"Oh,"
Did something good happen today?
Huh?
"No, what good thing?"
"Aigoo, I wish something good happened to us."
Why? &amp;lt;BR&amp;gt;&amp;lt;BR&amp;gt;Did something happen?
"Oh, it's not that..."
I think it's going to take a long time to build the new house.
I can't get insurance on it since it's done by natural disasters.
And the company who was supposed to construct are just shrinking from their responsibility.
"Then what should we do, Dad?"
"Ah, don't worry."
"It will be resolved, but it will take some time."
"Although it might be uncomfortable, plan on staying here for a while."
Yes.
"I am sorry, Ha Ni!"
What's there for you to be sorry about?
Don't worry about me.
I am fine.
Okay.
Welcome!
-Hello!
-Hello!
"Oh, you two came?"
We didn't even open yet!
Sit!
Sit!
What are you doing here at this time?
We're in New York. other members have to shoot but I finished my part in D.C. yesterday.
So Jong Up and I went shopping.
The jumbo screens assure me that this really is Times Square!
B.A.P has finally arrived at Times Square.
It's an honor.
It really is an honor.
I still can't believe it.
Times Square.
This is Time Square.
I've only seen it in pictures.
This is my first time here.
All this fanciness.
ls that a celebrity?
Who's that?
one two okay. one two.
The weather is awesome today.
The buildings around here are tall so usually this street gets less sunlight.
But today the sun's shining so much.
"(Very satisfied) Wow, good."
That dog looks happy too.
"Yo, New York City."
We're headed to the set feeling like we're VlP.
"Today, we're filming at MTV in Time Square."
We'll be customizing shoes and painting murals.
Time for some cultural activities.
It feels more like playing rather than working.
You know what I'm saying?
I'll be styling my own shoes.
I'll be making one-of-a-kind shoes.
This looks like a really famous shop. for street artists.
It seems many famous street artists have come through here.
I wanted to make my outfit or shoes with this printing.
"Yes, I'd be doing them a favor."
I'd be doing good.
Yes.
(robo speak) (robo speak)
Space 911.
"Looking at you all, I think it's pretty obvious you've never been this high before."
It is my belief that hunger will soon become a serious concern.
"With your permission, my masters..."
"Yes, a craving I have!"
For taquitos and cheese dip!
I've heard legends of a taco... ...made entirely out of Dorito.
If it exists we will find it.
"Master, sir."
I heard Yoda talking about midichlorians.
I've been wondering... ...what are midichlorians?
It's herion.
"Come on, boy."
We have located the Jedi.
We have them right where we want them.
Good.
This is almost over.
Just remember to keep all of your receipts.
This is a business trip.
Everything we do here is tax deductible.
At last.
I will show the Jedi who is truly lord of the dance. ...conference call to go over our quarterly report.
Maul?
Maul!
Snap out of it.
Are you even listening to me?
Yes.
Business trip.
Then I would wake up and cry again.
I really couldn't go on.
"I swore to forget about Gil Dong, so that I could live."
What could I do? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;It's not like he went somewhere I could follow.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
I found myself being able to live each day.
Then someday I wouldn't even think about Gil Dong at all.
That's how I lived.
But you know...
I'm so dumb.
I forget sometimes that I'm not supposed to think about him.
"When that happens, my heart hurts really badly."
I can't go on!
I wish I'd just become really stupid.
I can't see you like this anymore.
Do you remember any big event twenty years ago in the fall?
"For example, a rich noblewomen running away with a daughter?"
- Twenty years ago?
"- Yes, the year the late king passed away."
How can we remember something that long ago?
This...!
This is Chunmyungdan.
Try it.
"Doctor Heo, please help us."
He's the son of the Interior Minister.
Please take him home for us.
We're short on staff.
Please?
The son of the Interior Minister?
He must be Gil Dong's older brother.
- I just want one more drink.
- Please be careful.
In Hyung!
So little?
Go in
Great
You can't do it drunk like that
Let me do it for him
Go out of the window， just in case
You two keep the door
You go and get a hot towel
Landal， Landal
Landal
What are you so surreptitious?
Nothing， sir
You must go down tonight
I know.
Let me have more chat before the time's up
I'll come back to pick you up
Don't go away
Take care
Time's running out.
I'll have the make-or-break try
Keep away， bloody ghost
Wake up
A cup of ginseng tea to sober him
What，s up?
Nothing.
It's scalding
It's scalding
I want to drink wine
You'll wake up soon after drinking
You're nice.
Mimi， you give me wine
Drink， drink it quickly
Fine! kaka sir has said we have received your gold. - okay.

"Tell Raman that the gold will be delivered tomorrow morning! okay, sir! - okay!"

Where is the group?
"Why didn""t you bring them here? very sorry, sir."
Presenting corpses is illegal. shut up!
Listen! - sir!
Where was that call from?
"- From Alibagh, sir! shift our headquarters there immediately."
"- Right, sir! very good idea, sir!"
The police should keep a tab on the culprits.
"And the culprits should keep a tab on the police. so that it""s easy for both of them."
Rao.
"- Yes, sir!"
Will you please shut up?
And get out!
Returning today Rajesh!
"I'll tell you what, Chris: as long as you have that book in front of you, do me a favor, turn to a year outside of the 1900s, either into the 1800s or way into the 2000s -- that'll be a much greater challenge for me."
AB:
What year would you like?
CA:
1824.
AB:
"1824, OK."
AB:
And what month?
CA:
June.
AB:
June what?
CA:
Sixth.
AB:
Was that a Sunday?
CA:
It was.
AB:
And it was cloudy.
(Laughter)
"Good, thank you very much."
(Applause)
(Applause ends)
But I'd like to wrap things up now by alluding to something from earlier in the presentation.
There was a gentleman up here who had a 10-digit calculator.
"Where is he, would you stand up, 10-digit guy?"
"OK, stand up for me just for a second, so I can see where you are."
"You have a 10-digit calculator, sir, as well?"
"OK, what I'm going to try and do, is to square in my head a five-digit number requiring a 10-digit calculator."
"But to make my job more interesting for you, as well as for me,"
Come to the front door.
"Yes, I entered from the chimney, I'll exit from the door."
Let's do it.
Great.
Aleykum selam.
How is it going?
- (?) Kuzey Bey.
- Hands off.
Don't pounce at me like hound.
I'll tell you something though.
There's a security vulnerability on that building.
Looks like some people broke the cameras in the yard.
Especially the walls surrounding the guest mansion.
"Don't be so stingy, man."
Spend some money to get those fixed.
- Kuzey Bey.
"- Telling you, people could walk right into the mansions."
- Salamun aleyküm.
"- Aleykum selam, bro."
Mission accomplished?
"Great, let's go then."
Your people got worried mad about you.
They kept calling me.
"- Nah, they are used to it."
"- Well, I don't know."
"They gave me headaches, asking me where you went off to after the trial."
"Why does everyone who can't reach you, call me?"
I don't know if I am a phone operator or a missing person office.
"You are my accomplice, what else do you want to be?"
"- Always, bro."
Don't worry.
- Thanks.
Absolutely.
"What do you mean by ""work"", Keung?"
You won't understand!
I'm doing it for love!
Tell me.
I've became a different person ever since I met her.
I've do whatever she ask me to.
She wanted me to find a job.
I found a job.
I've ask her to marry me and she promised!
"Unbelievable, isn't it?"
"You just love her big tits, don't you?"
You jealous?
"Hell, I'm jealous!"
"In the past, I would have boasted myself so much... not anymore!"
I've something for you...
Organic Contribute Form
What?
It's out of your mind?
Read it first!
Ms Lee gave it to me the other day.
She looked at me in my eyes and said...
"""Keung, for guys like you who are in this killing business..."""
"""...life may mean nothing."""
"""But by completing this form..."""
"""...you'll be able to do society some good."""
"""You'll be saving someone's life even after you're dead."""
"""By doing this, you'll make your life worth living."""
This Ms Lee whom Keung's talking about is a social worker.
God knows what she sees in Keung that made her love him.
It's just fuckingly incredible!
"Here she is, doing her endless research!"
Look at those dorms you've got!
Look at all those lawns!
Plumbing!
Television!
Gas cooking!
Greenhouses!
Flower pots!
Activities!
Children.
"You are ""masters of this camp."""
You are!
"What is required of you, my friends?"
- Dis-cip-line!
- I expressly forbade swimming to the island.
But Inochkin ignored the rules and did it anyway.
- They all probably have whooping-cough there!
- No they don't!
"- Quiet, third troop."
"- Try to be more like the second troop, will you?"
Who can guarantee now that Inochkin isn't infected?
Who?
"And it's not the first infraction from him, either!"
On his first day here he started fighting with sticks!
And after him everyone started doing it.
Even girls!
"At night, under his blanket, he lit a flashlight and started reading a book!"
"And everyone else started, too!"
And today he swam to the island!
"What now, is everyone going to swim to the island, too?"
What next?
Do we start jumping across the river?
And that's not all!
"Peter, tell us about yourself."
Do you have a girlfriend?
Well...
I don't really know.
"Well, shouldn't you know?"
"I mean, who would know?"
Leave him alone.
Maybe is a secret love.
Love should never be a secret.
If you keep something as complicated as love stored up inside... ...gonna make you sick.
I finally got lucky in love.
We both did.
But is hardly perfect.
You have to work at it.
"I met him on the college steps, and I knew it wasn't going to be easy."
"He was studying science, and I was studying English literature."
Thas right.
I was trying to explain the theory of relativity.
And Rosie was trying to explain T.S. Eliot.
I still don't understand what he was talking about.
"Yes, you do."
I'm serious.
T.S. Eliot is more complicated than advanced science.
"But if you want to get a woman to fall in love with you, feed her poetry."
Poetry.
Never fails.
A tall and slender maiden All alone upon a prairie...
Brightest green were all her garments...
And her hair was like the sunshine...
Day by day he gazed upon her...
Rent!
Where is my money?!
"We've found someone, 46."
-Take him out first.
-Yes.
"This afternoon, a fire broke out in a Seoul warehouse, 35-year old Lee who was working inside the warehouse was injured from smoke inhalation."
"While rescuing him, two firemen from Dobong Station received burns and are currently in intensive care."
The fire burned down the whole warehouse and $350 thousand worth of property was damaged.
The fire was out after an hour.
The police are investigating the cause based on the witness' depositions.
How did you get here?
I'm okay.
I'm not hurt.
I am the one who's hurt.
I can't take it anymore.
"Every time I hear a siren, my heart drops."
Soo-jeong.
"It's okay, so let's go."
There are other people here.
"No, it's not okay."
Who cares about other people?
"- I care about you, and about myself."
- Soo-jeong.
"These people say you're cool, encouraging that you are a great fireman."
"That's all, isn't it?"
"Su-jeong, that's not it."
"And so they just push you deeper and deeper into the fire, right?"
"Soo-jeong, no..."
You know... how we work here...
You know.
"No, I don't know."
I've forgotten it all.
"When you say 'we', I'm not included, so how can I know?"
"104 this is 10, roger."
"Oh, Gary McDonough."
His mother just died when he was in Florida.
He retired from GM and he was down there.
They're all pretty much retired.
"Caroline, she married a real nice guy"
He started off as a mechanic for the school district of the county just south of
Travers City.
He was running it years and years ago.
He was the head guy running the - he knew stuff.
He knew engines.
Nice guy.
So that worked out.
But now they spend their summers over there someplace.
They get back here once in a while.
They have something in Florida.
So the whole bunch is pretty good.
Sally's got this...
Nice girl.
She could ice skate.
She was a good ice skater.
Did the fancy stuff.
We skated out one time
I think it was [?] and Gary and myself.
February.
"And like one of them two week old ice, where it froze yay thick."
We went out after school and it was cold.
Where?
Out in the - just ice skating out towards Grey's Reef
The harbor?
Towards [?].
"And we got out there and - beautiful, just"
"like shotguns going off, when the ice cracks, when it's freezing, you know."
Come and dance with us come on ... purge your demons!
How long are you going to stay drunk?
How would you prefer me?
Perhaps riding in the head of my four legions to meet him in battle?
For yet another victory celebration?
A true king is not a coward!
I am not a coward
I am merely a fool in exile with no place to hide except my wife's country
Enough!
Enough!
Everybody out!
Out
Be well
I trusted you
I believed in you
"I, l believed in your strength"
Could I have misjudged you?
You misjudged yourself
It may be your nature to see victory in defeat
"But it's not mine, I fear...l fear..."
I fear I can lead no more...
I should have died...l should have... where's my sword?
I had a sword...
I must die...
I must die with honor My men believed in me...
I must have it...
Stop it!
Give me my sword!
Give me my sword!
I must have my honor!
This is no honor!
ls this how you want them to remember you?
How long has he been here?
You won't believe this but 16 years...
You can find people like him in these kind of hospitals all around Turkey.
Nobody asks about them or visits them...
You can't find their family or relatives if you try to search for them.
"If somebody doesn't take him out of here, he will spend his whole life here."
They get along very well.
Mustafa...
How are you?
It is time for the medication...
Duriye Hanim!
Did you see him?
"Yes, I did Yasar."
Look...
I know that you can't bear your brother's situation.
"In my opinion, he is fighting his conscience and trying to come to terms with what he has done."
And you should let him do it.
"And Yasar, you know this, too."
My brother will not come back to us as long as Narin doesn't come.
That's all I know.
"Yes, Seher..."
What?
My Mom?
Duriye...
What happened Duriye?
"Father, she suddenly fell down."
Seher found her.
"When I heard Seher screaming, I immediately came here Aslan Bey."
It seems to me that her blood pressure went up...
"My Duriye, what will I do without you?"
"Look, don't you play a trick on me!"
Don't...
"ln my eyes, you are greatness"
"I'm here, I'm here with you"
Don't stay... don't stay with me...fight!
I'm not leaving you!
I'll be waiting for you in the next life
I see nothing but you!
I'll never be further from you than this!
Antony!
Queen Cleopatra!
Come out
Yield yourself to me!
Open this door!
ls she alive?
I don't know
Get the battering ram!
Caesar...
"So, Antony has gone to join Caesar"
"No, he's here with me"
Take the riches of Egypt Then let me die properly
I have no desire for you to die
"I've conquered a great country, a great Queen"
It's my wish that you accompany me to Rome
So you can walk me behind your chariots...you Egyptian prize?
Octavius' trophy?
"That would do, yes"
"I answer to no earthly superior, much less a mortal like yourself"
I am a goddess!
I am immortal!
"Ah yes, the Daughter of lsis"
You and I are very much alike
"Compelled to follow our own natures, fulfill our destinies"
"But I have won, Cleopatra And you will come to Rome!"
"I'll go check it, so you wait here."
"Ah, it's a cave."
There was a passage in this kind of place.
Pura and his mom must have entered through here.
Pura!
Don't do anything suspicious.
"If you do, the baby elephant won't survive."
Pura!
"Atom, right?"
What's behind that waterfall?
Are you not going to tell me?
There is a passage leading to where wild animals are...
-What?
Real animals?
-Is that for sure?
"All right, guide us to there."
"Hey, surely they are not going to cut our heads off for real, right?"
"They will just pretend to do it, unless they have some kind of breakdowns."
Breakdowns?
"My, that's horrible."
It's Zora.
It's looking this way.
Hey!
I made you!
Help.
My blood is draining to head.
You will fall if you keep wriggling.
Stop!
"Hello, hello."
Control Center!
Zora has escaped the surveillance and has invaded the wild animal protection area!
"Atom, don't do anything suspicious."
"Do you have any idea, how many people from this town he took under his wings and gave jobs to?"
And Selim...
His father-in-law is a parliament member.
Now why would a reputable and popular family like that want to ruin all their reputation?
Why would they get involved in an incident like this?
It makes no sense!
It's absurd.
"Besides, Selim got engaged the night of that incident."
"He spent the whole night with us until he joined his fiancée, and..."
Don't make me talk more...
"That's why, you better listen to me and accept that ""everything happens for a reason""."
Forget about what happened...
Forget about Fatmagül.
Hey dad.
"Okay, I am on my way."
"OK, I'll be there."
Mustafa...
Stay out of trouble son.
"Good day, Mr. Prosecutor."
It's Lawyer Munir Telci.
Sorry to bother you this time of day.
Are you in your office?
"Yes, I'll visit you to make a complaint."
"Yes, did you see the local newspaper?"
"Yeah, don't ask."
Yes.
I'll be there soon.
Just leaving home.
"OK, thank you."
See you soon.
"Mom, Ebe Nine is here."
Mithat Bey.
Relax.
The man I'm really smothering isn't really my father.
Dr Benson used to be the chef medicine still that great rapport with the nurses
Actually Carla totally gets me.
That's why I've been systemically trying to drive her away.
You ever see that therapist I recommended?
Not yet.
No!
"Shortness of breath, dizziness, problems urinating?"
"No, No, No. is it a problem if it whistles?"
"Oh, you're making that so much easier."
Are you sexually active?
"Oh, it's active."
Alright.
Rare dry spell in the margin.
Okay time for the physical
Okay.
Time for the physical.
Cold hands.
Suck it up.
"Elliot exam was frightening, reminiscent of when my older brother used to beat the crap out of me."
See.
That wasn't so bad.
All done.
I'm still puking every hour.
My fever's pretty high but you're sure it's okay for me to be out of bed right?
I don't know.
"Look, Dr. Benson wasmy mentor so don't that annoying thing."
What annoying thing?
You know when you talk.
Come on that's a little-
See there it is.
Except for the stabbing pain in my side.
"So he was up all night with the high fever, cramping and crying"
Dude!
"My bad, punching the wall all manly and angry like, you know what I mean."
See you later buddy/
Poor Bambi.
Don't worry Carla will take care of.
Make sure he gets submitted right away.
"On the bright side, it will be interesting to see what it feels like to be a patient."
You know people die here.
You are a good friend.
I do what I can.
Can I have your stuff?
So did you talk to any girls last night?
"Babe, I'm a attractive man."
We both know this.
It's just a burden you'll have to live with
One of many
JD talked some girl up
"Really, are you gonna call here?"
Not right away.
"Alright, showtime."
Clear out I can check him out.
You're examining me.
I don't want you to see my unmentionables.
I've seen underwear before.
"Actually I use the word ""unmentionable"" for my genitals as well."
68 year-old man respiratory distress and tightness in-
Save your breath.
"Hello, dad."
Never thought you'd call me that again after I left.
Dr. Cox!
But it's a lie
Not to them
So tell them the truth
If it helps you lie.
Janelle are you getiing any of this?
Me too.
I'm just testing you
"Look, sir."
All you gotta do is go back out there tell them you actually slept with Janelle and it pops### their whole balloon. it's over.
"I can't do that, Mike."
I didn't sleep with Janelle.
I'm gonna sully### her good name just to save my political hide###.
Sully.
Janelle bagged the mayor of the city.
"Am I right, janelle?"
Give me some
We'll work on it
Why are we stopping here?
I thought we were going to lunch
Bennet.
We need to talk
"Yo, carter, I thought we agreed we wasn't gonna it's all right."
These are my friends.
So they know about us
"Oh, my god, it's a gay boxer"
Bennet. lightheavy
I had you pegged for cruiser.
"That's a good idea Stuart, taunt the professional ass kicker"
I'm not afraid of him.
I used to box in college
You're way out of your league
Does anybody else smell that?
The social worker does that.
Not the doctor.
"Not the psychologist, not the nurse."
We do.
That's is what makes us agents of change.

Today we came to another airport.
We'll finish filming and enjoy our time in NYC.
NY fans are coming too.
NY style is supposed to be absolutely cool.
So we tried to be casual
Not to seem over-conscious.
This is NY.
It's unbelievable that I'm walking the streets of New York.
I can't believe it.
I received a business card.
He says he's a rapper in America.
He gave me a business card.
We finished off with a wonderful scene of America.
I was sitting over there and people started talking to me.
I couldn't understand them.
"We're in Manhattan, New York."
"The sun is shining, buildings are beautiful."
"I just really love this free, peaceful atmosphere."
"Most of all, the sunlight is the best here."
We wrapped my MV filming in NY well too. other members will film too.
I'm going to enjoy my free time.
I'm in NY.
"Wow, it's so great."
All the passersby's are awesome too.
The reason why filming is fun is not only because we show our new looks
But also because we come to new places.
It's awesome.
The sun just went down.
Boo hoo.
It really is America.
None
There are yellow taxies passing by.
"Evenin' sirs, welcome to SPACE hooters!"
The finest in tit related eatin' and drinkin' this side of the galaxy.
Can I start you boys off with somethin'?
Maybe a Tatooine Titty Twister or a Dagobah Dirt Bomb?
Just the bottle service.
Bottle service coming right up!
I have a bad feeling about this.
I think it's just early.
What?
The guests are Jedi?
I know trouble when I sees it.
Believe you me these boys is covered in it.
We're screwed!
You know the Jedi reputation.
"Listen, we have to get them out of here."
Peacefully.
How are we going to do that?
"I mean, we can't just kick them out."
"Whatever you do, do not piss these guys off."
Is it normal to make us wait this long?
Relax!
I'd like to try their hot wings.
I'm actually hungry.
"You boys expectin' ladies, or is this just a sausage festival?"
Not that there's anything wrong with a sausage festival.
Say sausage one more time.
Sausage.
Let me guess.
The Jedi were perfect gentlemen... ...paid their bill in full... ...and left with no fuss.
No!
They skip out on their bill!
They steal from the cash register!
There isn't one penny at the bank
We could find the money here
What if we don't find anything?
"I dunno, but I'm sure we'll find something"
Hopefully
"What's all this, grandpa?"
To know just how much I still remember you
It's all mine?
All of it is yours
"And when you get bored of it, I'll buy you more toys"
We'll play together
And they won't play with us?
"No, they have another game they're playing, nevermind them"
Let's just play together random stuttering
Grandpa
What?
They're all asleep
"Good, I needed to tell you a secret"
What secret?
A very big secret but you can never tell anyone
No-one?
Yes
Ok I won't
"No you'll tell them, but I'll tell you when to tell them"
Okay
What's wrong dad?
Are you gonna kill us?!
Hunting season has begun!
Hunting?
Yes!
Have you forgotten how great of a hunter I was?
"Come on, we're going to fayoum to go hunt ducks"
This is what I'm afraid of. woman:
That my husband will leave me for another wife because of a lack of you know what. child speaking native language:
Divorce.
Divorce.
How awful! woman:
I fear loneliness. man:
Not waking up one morning... and nobody finding you for a week.
That'd be interesting. woman:
Losing someone you love.
"That's why I find it very hard to really, really connect with someone."
"Because, what do you do when they're gone? girl:"
Because what if God isn't real?
"I believe in Him, but what if God isn't real?"
"And we're just going to lie in the ground, dead forever? woman:"
"And that's what I'm afraid of, being in this grave."
"Life is so freakin' short, you know?"
man:
"Dying, I guess."
[animal bells ringing]
[thunder rumbling]
[dog growling]
[man speaking native language] man:
The dogs are frightened of thunder. man speaking native language:
"Yeah, they're scared. man:"
"Vasya, we need to find some fireworks somewhere."
"Because in autumn, wolves will come. man:"
We need to hurry home.
It's going to rain!
all:
3...2...1... [cheering]
man:
Welcome to The Love Parade.
Didn't I ever go out with you?
When did you?
When did you ever take me out?
Should I remind you?
On our honeymoon.
"And I thought we'll go to Kashmir, Kulu Manali."
But where did you take me?
- Hubli.
And only because you were getting someone's bungalow free of cost.
"Kishen, you never cared about my feelings."
"Taking me for a movie, dinner, picnic was a farfetched thing."
You never uttered a romantic word to me.
"It takes two to tango, Mala."
You hated me before the marriage and also after.
I don't try to keep myself busy with the restaurant business for no reason.
I didn't go shopping without any reason.
"Kishen, if I am a shopaholic today then you're the reason for it."
"Because I tried to find happiness.. ..in these jewellery, clothes and shoes."
But now I have realised.. ..that I will never be able to find that happiness in all this.
"You found that out after spending 9, 35, 33, 315?"
"No, after wasting 12, 054 days and 23 1/2 hours of my life."
Dad.
Mom.
Mom.
Dad.
Mom.
I will never let you two separate.
Never.
I know I am going to do a crazy thing.
But there's no other way to stop this divorce.
"To change their present, I will have to change their past."
Professor.
I paint the rhinoceros
"Si, you have sad eyes"
"And big lips, melting over the hot sand"
With one tear
"Yes and in your tear, another face"
"The Christ face, yes"
"For the zillionth time, Dad, I'm an adult."
You don't have to stalk me.
"Georgia, I said I'm dropping you off."
"Now, just take off that shell and get in the car."
"Dad, my costume is the business."
I don't want it to get crushed.
"You look fantastic, love."
I just don't want you walking around the streets on your own.
Do you have any idea how long it took to get this right?
I have to make an entrance.
What's that?
And what are you supposed to be?
An obese leprechaun?
Anyone can see I'm a stuffed olive.
Stuffed is right.
"What happened to you, Ellen?"
You were supposed to come as a cocktail sausage.
"Well, my mum said no, her being a vegetarian and all."
Jas?
Cheese and pineapple stick?
"Well, the cheese made me look fat and yellow washes me out."
I didn't know how to be a vol au vent.
But we said we'd all go as hors d'oeuvres to be original.
It was supposed to be a laugh.
But boys don't like girls for funniness.
"- Sorry, Georgia."
Whatever will happen will happen.
I don't care anymore.
Then everyone will know that it's an arranged marriage and you took money for it.
This and everything will be revealed to public.
And then not even my uncle and Münir Abi can save us.
Then we'll all end up in prison.
Kerim...
Do you have any idea what it means to go to prison as a rapist?
Who do you think is responsible for the news?
"Hey, could it be your Ebe Nine?"
Who else could have gotten suspicions and spoke with that newsman?
- Maybe it's Galip Usta.
- Of course...
- Galip Usta is good friends with Newsman Ahmet.
- And he hates us.
I bet it's your Galip Usta told him everything.
I bet it's him.
"Oh, Kerim..."
Don't know...
Maybe it's someone else.
"I mean, it can be anyone."
There were mixed thoughts regarding the incident.
- So it can be anyone...
"- Anyway, it's okay."
It doesn't matter now.
We need to be careful from now on.
"If they reach you and try to make you talk... ... you shouldn't give them anything, no matter how hard they try, you understand?"
"Or else, we will all be toast."
It'll ruin us all.
- Who is it?
- Vural.
Don't answer it.
That's the equation -- this is the line that ... of
"solutions to 2x-y=0 my first row, first equation."
"So typically, maybe, x equal a half, y equal one will"
work.
And sure enough it does.
"Okay, that's the first one."
Now
the second one is not going to go through the origin.
It's
always important.
Do we go through the origin or not?
"In this case, yes, because there's a zero over there."
"In this case we don't go through the origin, because if x and y are"
"zero, we don't get three."
"So, let me again say suppose y is"
"zero, what x do we actually get?"
"If y is zero, then I get x is minus"
three.
"So if y is zero, I go along minus three."
So there's
one point on this second line.
"Now let me say, well, suppose x is"
minus one -- just to take another x.
"If x is minus one, then this is a"
"one and I think y should be a one, because if x is minus one,"
then I think y should be a one and we'll get that point.
Is that right?
"If x is minus one, that's a one."
"If y is a one, that's"
a two and the one and the two make three and that point's
on the equation.
Okay.
This place is quite big for a robot safari park.
"Ah, there's the border."
Hello!
A real elephant has come here.
What are you talking about?
But look...
-Then go over to that side.
"-Yes, sir!"
There is an invisible beam fence around this place.
Then where did this elephant come from?
It can never enter this place!
It must be a robot.
"No, this is a real..."
Leave.
I'm busy.
This is a real one for sure.
But it is true that it did come from somewhere.
"Hey, where did you come from?"
Hold on.
"Atom, Atom."
He's late.
Where did he go?
Doctor Ochanomizu.
Welcome to our safari park.
"Hey, Doctor Hura."
How is it?
Isn't this a wonderful park?
I feel reluctant to use animals for hunting even if they were robots.
You are still too serious.
Real animals are decreasing in its number recently.
So I developed animal robots that's the same as real ones so tourists can observe them and enjoy hunting.
That's why I opened this safari park in this vast field of Africa.
This is Brooklyn.
My last solo filming remains.
It's raining so much right now.
I'm filming a piano scene today.
I hope it comes out well.
"This piano has been with me since the days of ""I Remember""."
Do you remember?
This piano from the gun shot scene and raining scene.
"It's returned for ""Coffee Shop"" as well."
Wearing a white t-shirt and sneakers.
That's my ideal girl.
ls there any girl who looks good in a white t-shirt and sneakers?
The staff has a harder time for this shoot.
"I just need to rap, but everyone else... is out of breath."
The fountain suddenly burst.
All the sound equipment is in there but the fountain suddenly burst.
lsn't this the beauty of filming?
Hey that dog is taking a bath.
He seems happy.
Look at him drinking water.
We're done.
I'm done filming.
Him Chan and Jong Up were supposed to film here too.
But the NY weather is not good today.
It's cold and raining a lot.
"Unfortunately, we have to stop filming."
So everyone has to go to the studio for group filming.
There's more working than playing in NY.
But I'm still happy.
When else could I come here?
We just talked about our taste for music and dancing.
He says I have very good control.
(chuckles)
"Fred:Oh, and I almost forgot to say,"
"I'm gonna give Judy a basket, too."
"Um, I don't know why, exactly, but for some reason, my ""Fred"" channel on YouTube says that I joined two years ago."
"If I would've joined two years ago, I'd only be 4 years old."
Do you really think I'd know how to work a computer if I was 4?
"Seriously, I thought you were smarter than that."
"So, yeah, it wasn't actually my channel."
"I was just annoying YouTube, I kept banging on their, you know, door."
"And finally, they said, ""Okay!"
"We'll give you the channel."""
Time to go outside!
Here I go!
(laughs)
Fred:Let's run!
Happy May Day!
(gasps) (gasps in slow motion) (screams)
Fred:He threw the basket at my face!
(Fred crying)
"Fred:I spent so much time working on that basket, trying to make people happy, he threw the darn basket at me!"
"Oh my God, look at this."
"I just realised that right behind me in my neighbor's yard, there's a dog kennel."
"You know inhumane that is, locking your dogs in frickin' gates?"
"How would you feel if I locked you in between gates and watched you from above, laughing evilly?"
(Fred laughing evilly)
Fred:Dogs don't like it either.
"(Fred) Oh, my God, look at this kitty."
"She doesn't wanna be discovered be me, look at her run."
"Fred:Oh, it's a stray kitty with lice."
"Also, I bit one of the other kids in my neighborhood and gave him rabies."
"Oh, my God, she just bit me!"
She just bit me and I'm foamin' from the mouth!
"You're in love with him too, Doe Eyes!"
Just drink.
Please forgive me for not accompanying you today.
I ran away.
So you shouldn't have come with me anyway.
Can you guess where the tea leaves are?
Here.
I was watching the whole time.
- It's no fun playing with you.
- Let me do it again.
"I've become a bit strange, haven't I?"
But I feel really at ease.
"You're drinking too much, aren't you?"
You should only be drinking from crystal clear streams.
It's because I'm so happy to see you!
"Now that we've spent some time, we should take our leave."
Just stay a while longer.
It feels like olden days when I'm with you.
It feels like Gil Dong is with us like olden days!
"When I'm with you, I'm so happy because"
I can talk about Gil Dong with you.
"I thought you'd forgotten about him, but it seems you haven't."
I shouldn't think of Gil Dong.
I forgot again.
Stupid!
"Even though Gil Dong is dead, we should still remember him from time to time."
But I shouldn't think about him at all.
Because... then I can't go on.
I couldn't sleep.
I couldn't eat.
I couldn't stop crying.
I saw Gil Dong everywhere like it was a dream. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I kept calling him to go with him.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;But he would just vanish.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Awesome.
You'd do that for me?
"Yeah, I would."
"First you have to get your audition tape put together, and, uh, Mr. Collins has final say."
Don't worry about the camera.
"I normally only loan it out for a couple of days, but for you, you can keep it for as long as you want it."
Thanks.
Let me know if there's ever anything I can do for you.
Good luck on your audition tape.
I hope we'll be working together soon.
Count on it.
"What are you gonna do for your audition tape, Liz?"
I'm not sure yet.
Something with substance.
"Well, I don't know about you guys, but I want to be the director."
How hard can it be?
I choreographed all our best cheers this year.
I'm sure I can handle a little news show.
"Hello, future fans and news junkies."
Make room for Sweet Valley's new Barbara Walters.
Since when are you interested in journalism?
Journalism?
It's TV news.
"Easy, Babs."
You have to research and write your own stories.
"Details, details."
It's a small price to pay for having my face in every classroom.
"Hey, Winston!"
What's up...
Patman?
"Now, why so suspicious?"
"""Winston""?"
"Duriye Teyze, I swear..."
You should have seen it..
"He aimed at the most vile, problematic person in the garden..."
Oh Gosh...
Unbelievable...
"Yasar dude, have you seen what your brother did?"
Good job...
"You are raising a child there, it seems.."
Why didn't you play long donkey and five stones?
The man has gone...
My husband has gone...And you don't even care...
My son has gone...
"It is only Narin who can do something about this, but... the Doctor is not going to say anything to her, either."
Give that to me...
You go and bring the cold meals from the downstairs.
Stuffed grape leaves and beans...
Asiye!
Go away!
Don't spill your poison here...
It is easy for you to say go...
You didn't see Mustafa in the nuthouse.
"But, I did."
I wish I were blind and didn't see him in that condition.
He is finished Hatun Abla.
They ruined my husband!
"Not just me, he doesn't even recognize his parents."
He looked at us as if he was a five year old kid.
They just don't diaper him; it is that terrible...
"We took old pictures there,  thinking that they may help him to remember..."
He only recognized Narin.
He pointed at her with his finger.
He has kept only... ...Narin in his mind.
"My story is, I can't work, because who else would look after my kids?"
"My wife passed away, my children's mother."
I've got a 20 year old son who is sick.
He's a retard.
We have to tie him up all day to stop him wandering off.
Fourteen people live in this place.
"We have no electricity, no water, no drains."
But we are still alive.
God will not forget us.
He created us.
That is what I believe.
God wouldn't have created this population just to forget us.

There is no work at home.
It's more profitable to come to Dubai.

Goddamned thistles everywhere.
And you think I'm a prick.
[laughter]
man:
My department also has the same opinion.
"You doubted him right, Damodar."
This is Jimmy's report.
I've brought it from intelligence department.
He's a smuggler.
He's connected with a smuggling gang from Singapore.
This is his file.
"The moment we get some evidence, we'll arrest him."
That's a lie.
Fine!
"I'm lying, Damodar is lying."
Even the ClD officers are lying.
Only my friend Shreekant is right.
But uncle.
How You better don't interrupt.
Just keep quiet.
If the son-in-law will be a smuggler... ...your house will be filled with smuggled goods.
We'll become a millionaire.
Our daughter will be happy.
Our family will get prestige.
- Mr. Bharat!
- Yes.
Did you understand?
My son-in-law can't be a criminal.
This marriage can't take place.
Never...
Jimmy!
A smuggler can never be my son-in-law.
"So, I'm canceling this marriage."
Had I not concerned about my prestige... ...I'd have punished you for this fraud.
Shreekant!
No!
of course if they go well as I hope.
"I need to take a breath too, this short holiday will be good for both of us."
"I also would like it very much , my baby but I have to be here on Monday."
"On Friday evening I'll pick you up at Dalaman, from the airport we will go straight to the ship."
"You have a guest, Sude Beylice."
"Yes, of course we'll talk again, see you, bye."
Welcome Sude.
Thank you.
"You know everything, so i get straight to the subject."
"Please , take a sit."
"I came to ask your advice, Mr.Asim."
"After last night's happenings in our life , i really don't know what to do."
Why are you thinking?
Leave it to Faruk to think .
"Yasemin, please bring us some coffee."
Let mine be quite strong please!-Of course.
Tell the captain to prepare the ship for the weekend.
Don't let anything be missing.
"I will invite my friends.- Good ,sir."
"Yes dear, now i'm listening you."
We must do this work before the switch sockets come.
Look!
Master!
I will change my clothes and will go.
"Okay, take your money..(pay)."
What money is that?- It's your pay for the week my boy.
Is that so?
- Were we going to make you work gratis?
May God make it plenty (way of thanking )- Use it with happiness &amp;gt;Thank you.
Hypocrite.
Be careful.

* 5 years later *
"Your Majesty, Seong-won prince is here to see you."
* 5 years later *
"Your Majesty, Seong-won prince is here to see you."
I haven't seen you for a while.
"Where have you been, my brother?"
I've been wondering without staying in the same place.
"Your Majesty, I'm afraid you look so ill."
"I haven't been well for a few days,  but seeing you is making me feel much better."
How is the world outside of the palace?
The weather is cold enough to have fruits on the  trees and the colors of autumn are beautiful to see.
Your people are taking chrysanthemum flowers to make wine...
"This is happening often, recently."
The royal doctors don't know the reason either.
It's just very frustrating.
He will get better soon.
Your highness need not worry so much.
"You left so sudden, I was worried."
You worried about me?
My thoughtlessness made you both worry.
I'm just glad you come back healthy.
I came as soon as I heard of His Majesty's illness.
"That'll be ten marks, about t---"
"This scoudrel took off without paying,"
He just upped and left.
Sacramentum what a redhead.
He didn't take off.
I was just trying if your powder is the real thing.
Here's your money.
"Thank you, thanks a lot!"
"Just like that, excellent!"
Would you like anything else.
"Nothing else, thanks, except that you stop calling me a redhead behind my back."
"Goodbye, I'm off."
Goodbye
Come back again.
"Hey, redhead!"
"Here, take this suitcase to the teacher's apartment."
Now I'm out of breath.
"Oh my god, where did this brat disappear to."
That must have been a stone from under a car tyre.
The doorbell is ringing.
The doorbell is ringing.
"Oh how long I was waiting for you, darling."
Dear teacher.
My master dear.
Why do we meet so rarely.
How nice it is that school has breaks.
We can spend the entire break together.
"When we'll be together all the time for all our lives, we'll bear the good and the bad things together."
Take a seat on the sofa.
What a lovely sofa.
And now we'll have a cup of hot coffee together.
Are you tired from the long winter
A man came by here earlier today.
He said it was wooden buckshot.
"Told me if anyone got in our way,"
I'm supposed to shoot 'em.
What else did he say?
If Abby didn't find the location of some coffins...
I'm supposed to shoot myself.
What about me?
What did he say about me?
I'm not supposed to hurt you.
Are you sure?
Because...
These ropes are so tight that it is hurting me.
What can I do to help?
"Every time I move, the wood shifts inside of me."
I can feel it scraping against my heart.
You need to get the pieces out.
Aahh!
What took you so long?
I've been hiding behind your witchy friends.
"And in squalor, no less."
Insulting a bunch of dead witches...
Not smart.
I made the exact same mistake first time I came in here.
"Well, you know the funny thing about the witches is that living or dead, they care about their own."
A hundred dead witches have a thousand living descendents...
And I have no problem killing every last one of them if I don't get my coffins back.
"As we speak, my hybrid friend is prepared to end the Bennett line."
Now.
Please...
Show me the coffins.
Here we are.
"But, you said some people choose to have sex this way some people choose not to have sex that way some people compromise."
"So, is it an orientation or is it a choice to be asexual?"
David:
How you feel internally is an orientation.
Star:
Okay.
David:
"What you do - so, an asexual person who does not feel desire to have sex. can choose to have sex if they're in a situation."
Star:
So that's more in your socializing?
David:
There is no desire.
Star:
Gotcha
Joy:
But how does that work?
[laughter]
Joy:
I can see for a woman.
"You know, she can just lie there."
"But you, you have to do something."
[laughter]
David:
There are gay guys who have sex with women before they realize they're gay.
It's the same.
Joy:
"Gay men who have sex with women, yes."
But they're fantasizing about a man.
Star:
You're right.
Chandra:
"And then you said that married couples and that, you know, they can make a choice to have sex"
Looking good.
Different and uncommon.
"lndeed, Reporter Jung of B.A.P."
He's a sensitive man who knows how to be romantic.
It's just piece of art no matter how you take it!
I heard that bridge was built in 1935.
"lts height is similar to that of ""63 building"" in Korea. &amp;lt;""The island across from here is the world's largest prison""&amp;gt; Wow, that?"
- That looks like an island.
- That's the world's largest prison?
I heard there are Dementors living inside.
Look at him enjoying nature.
It's freezing.
It would be so much fun to have a concert in a place like this.
My hair is stiff because of all the mousse I have in there.
That goes totally well with him.
He's got the aura.
Doesn't he look like a celebrity?
The wind is crazy.
I'm happy but it's cold.
It's always cold.
You can't tell on screen.
But this is a cliff.
I'm scared.
So when I was shooting that scene
I felt like it was life or death for me.
Great job.
Hi.
We're in San Francisco.
It's supposed to be a normal street in a town but the aura is totally different.
Taking pictures anyway still looks professional.
It's cold.
This is a port city in San Francisco.
He will go in and Kuzey Tekinoğlu will go out.
That was the deal.
"Yes, he's the one who offered to go to prison instead of an innocent person."
You're still so sure about Kuzey's innocence.
You're both the prosecutor and the judge of your father's case.
That man isn't my father.
He's a killer.
"Whoever pulled the trigger Kuzey or his men, doesn't matter."
They are not more guilty than Ferhat.
"So yes, an innocent person killed Ferhat."
Mirza knew he would die soon.
And when I told him Kuzey's story he wanted to help him.
But now... ... it hurts to know that he's spending his last days like that.
Wish I could see him at least for the last time.
"Okay, I'll try to do something."
- Thank you very much.
- You are welcome.
I went and checked on the Makara stalls a few times.
"- Everything's going smoothly, don't worry."
"- Okay, good."
Soon you'll be out of here anyway and get back to business.
We'll see.
It's too early to talk about that.
I'll handle the business until you're out.
Don't worry about it.
- Thank you.
- There's not much until 4th of the month.
The visitation is over.
"Warden, could you please give us 5 more minutes."
It was already over 5 minutes ago.
"Okay then, talk to you later."
God be with you.
them.
"So the first column is over two and down one, right?"
So there's the first column.
The first column.
Column one.
It's the vector two minus one.
The second column is --
minus one is the first component and up two.
It's here.
There's column two.
"So this, again, you see what its"
components are.
"Its components are minus one,"
two.
Good.
That's this guy.
Now I have to take a combination.
What combination shall I take?
"Why not the right combination, what"
the hell?
Okay.
So the combination I'm going
to take is the right one to produce zero three and then we'll see it
happen in the picture.
So the right combination is to take
x as one of those and two of these.
It's because we already know that
"that's the right x and y, so why not take the correct"
combination here and see it happen?
"Okay, so how do I picture this"
linear combination?
So I start with this vector that's
We didn't know that so we both came here wearing hats.
We look too much alike.
This is the hat Dae Hyun was planning on wearing.
But he took it off and now he's getting his hair styled.
The concept has us meeting altogether in New York
"After wandering around in L.A., San Francisco"
And in Washington D.C.
There's a scene where Dae Hyun and I pass by each other.
Since you're wearing a hat it'll be better for you to sit down.
Dae Hyun can walk.
I'd only seen that in my dreams.
How cool is that.
That's the Statue of Liberty.
I can see the Statue of Liberty in the distance from here
It's so amazing.
It's the most exciting and cool thing I've seen in the U.S. thus far.
"It's huge even from here, how big would it be from up close?"
I was so surprised.
I wasn't expecting to see it from here.
I'm seeing it for the first time.
I'm seeing it from afar.
"Wow, I'm really in NY."
Cut!
The atmosphere in the background helps a lot.
It matches the song very well.
So it's very empowering.
"Today, the concept for my outfit and hair is an intern at the Brooklyn Newspaper."
It seems very different from the Brooklyn I'd seen in movies.
I really want to go to where the statue of liberty is at.
I think we might go. or I just have to go there.
"Please put an ice cream cone here, with CG."
"Finally, I got to see the Statue of Liberty."
You don't know him.. but..
"If his hand stayed still, his arm would not.."
"If his arm didn't work, his mouth would.."
Look at his condition...
I understand.
"It is difficult for you all, too."
"But, Mustafa Bulut has given up on the real world, even without the effects of the medication."
"This is the most difficult time for us, as well."
He will heal faster if those close to him come and spend time with him here.
"What are you saying, Doctor?"
"Of course, we will come!"
We are childhood friends!
"Everything we eat, drink has been together."
Do you think I would abandon my brother?
Why don't you sit down?
Why are you acting like a stranger?
Of course she is not a stranger!
Gulengul is our daughter.
Our big family... ... this is all we have...
"Ah, my son... look at us.."
My beautiful Mother... don't worry yourself so.
He is going to be happy again...
He is going to mess with us when he returns..
Just wait...
Hasan...
"Aslan Bey ordered somethings, Yasar Abi."
Enjoy your food.
"Come, sit with us..."
"No, my mother wanted somethings..."
I am going to go home.
The poor woman is by herself.
Let me help Hasan.. With your permission..
"Did something happen, Hasan?"
"Abla, you are here every day!"
This house's troubles will never end!
"Mom says somethings, too."
Stay home for a little bit!!!
"Did you stay here, Aslan?"
Duriye...
"I told myself not to mess with you, but... ... this is my house!"
My name is Aslan Bulut!
Don't drive me crazy!
Don't push it!!!
"My God, I don't want to hurt your feelings, but enough!!!"
I will stay in my house whenever I want!!!
"Am I supposed to ask your permission, woman????"
"I have tried to make you happy... ..to show you your worth... ..but, enough is enough!"
"And, I don't want to hear such ever again, from anyone!!!"
Where is my tea???
"Off, what a difficult situation!!!"
"Eh, they are going to be sorry even more, Ibo..."
It's not that easy...
"Don't say that, Seher... it is a pity for everyone."
Wasn't it a pity when they were doing it???
Let's hope we are not guilty of anything...
"See, how they have been torn to pieces.."
I don't think they will be problem free until Narin forgives them..
I doubt Narin will forgive them..
"Inci, I have been calling Narin, but she is not answering her phone."
"Harun went to Ankara... she shouldn't stay there by alone by herself, She should come here, Inci Abla."
"Okay.. relax.. perhaps she is in the garden, has some work to do.. She will come when she finishes her work."
- I hope that's the case.
- I am going mom...
"- Ok, sweetheart."
"Every summer we were excited of going there not because of the holidays ,but because we would eat there."
We would go there without fail.
The same for this place.
"It's like that, they have many clients, everyone comes."
Thanks &amp;gt; enjoy it.
Yoghurt? &amp;gt; I will have one more!
Brother if you could bring us two other yoghurts please!
"Ok, ok."
I will take care of Mr. Ismet's issue now.
I have his car.
"I'll eat something, then I will go, it's a long way."
"Ok, if there isn't any lameness we will hand it in at the evening."
"Okay, bye..."
"Wooow, what's up man?"
I recognized you only from your face.
"What can there be, what about you? &amp;gt; Fine."
Hello..&amp;gt; Hello.
I was talking about you here in above.
"I accused you wrongly, by God..."
I said:
"""Yaman forgot all this way"""
I can't forget it even if I wanted.
"How are you, do you have any trouble?&amp;gt; No, thanks. what are you doing?- As you know, the same."
I still work in the phone installment .
Do you have any news from Kenan?
"I didn't see him yet, he is fine."
I am waiting for the visit permission.
Say hello to him when you see him.
I will go to him on the first opportunity I have.
I'll tell him.
"Hey... who's she?- I just came to the reeve, there is nothing more."
Did you get your registration?- For some papers issues.
"You wanna know if I was moving on without you I miss you, miss you, miss you, I miss you"
"To tell the truth I've thinking about you lately I miss you, miss you, miss you, I miss you"
Burning Desires Part Two
[Questioner:]
My whole life I thought I wanted to get married and have a child and live happily ever after.
[Mooji:]
"Yes, Yes Yes.."
[Q:]
Ok?
And it hasn't happened.
I've been in and out of relationships.
And I'm getting older.
"And I still believe I want to find this man, who is going to make me happy and I want to have a child with him."
And I want to live happily ever after.
"And then I find this man, and then I'm finding his faults."
And I don't know if I want him anymore.
I don't know if I want his child.
Because I'm looking for something else.
And I've been doing this most of my life.
[M:]
Yes.
"Some,something. ..It's good, It's good to say"
"It's good to say, because I don't think you're not the only one, Ok?"
[Laughs]
[M:]
Ok.
"So, like this, it's good to speak it out."
"Because then you send, it out again in to the empty, in to space."
"And what is clear, is that this is not actually bringing any happiness."
"It is a sort of like a promise, promise, a sort of something, and keeps you on the move, you see."
But you're aware of this now.
You're aware of that.
3 minus 1.
So it's 6 over 2.
"When x changes by 2-- that's this 2, change in x-- y changes by 6."
That's change in y.
So the slope is 3.
So the equation of our line is going to be y is equal to 3x plus some y-intercept.
And now we could substitute some points in.
Let's substitute this one.
"This 1, 1 seems easy."
So y is equal to 1 when x is equal to 1.
So we get 1 is equal to 3 plus b.
Subtract 3 from both sides of this equation and we get what?
"1 minus 3 is minus 2 is equal to-- obviously, this disappears, 3 minus 3."
So b is equal to minus 2.
"So the equation of our line, we have a slope of 3 and a y-intercept of minus 2."
The equation is going to be y is equal to 3x plus b.
Well b is minus 2.
So minus 2.
And that is choice C. 32.
The equation of line I is 6x plus 5y equals 3.
And equation of line q is 5x minus 6y is equal to 0.
Which of the statements about the two lines are true?
"OK, let's see."
They have the same y intercept.
They're parallel.
They have the same x-intercept.
Lines I and q are perpendicular.
Well I'll tell you how you can identify perpendicular lines.
They have the negative inverse of each other's slope.
But I don't know if that's going to come into play yet.
I always find it easier to look at these lines in kind of the slope y-intercept form.
So let's do that.
I accused the butterfly wrongly.
The charge was written on me man.
"Let it be, no problem at all."
So?-The thunderstorm in my heart will go on.
I love Eylul so much
"Good- It can't be just go with ""Good"" and step down to the edge, we must join our powers for a new rendezvous."
"Mert, don't mix me man.- You can't ruin it."
We will stick together through thick and thin
You can't leave me in halfway...
"Man, you ask for a war man!"
"But I am asking for it in a sweet way, am i not brother?"
You can't say no.
I can see the smile in your face.
"Okay, I will close it.-Wait, wait, wait... don't close it, don't close it!"
I draw into talk.
I forgot something.
"I am in the forest way, I am done with my obligations I am coming back."
"See you at home!- Don't dare to be late, come early!"
Are you alright?
Did something happen?
"No,nothing, I'm alright."
"Your knee looks bad, shall we go to a pharmacy?"
"No need, my house is near anyways"
Will you be able to walk?
Nothing is sure in this life.
Mind is more important than money.
A stupid investment can turn one's life upside down.
"Unfortunately dear Mine, unfortunately..."
How old are you?&amp;gt; Eighteen...
"Okay sweetie, thanks for calling, good night!"
Hypocrite!
- Are you ok sweetie?-She was worried to know how I am.
I'll go already...
I'm tired...
You have to take a look to the future plans with your lover once more
Come on..
"You were in class A, I was in B"
I'm saying...
"This is why I don't remember you ,..."
But i remember you..
I remember of my all primary school friends.
It means there is a problem in my memory card.
"You were not interested in anyone, you didn't play with the other kids."
"Even during the breaks when everyone was running, you were sitting in the edge and reading books."
So that no one would mess with me.
"Actually, I was like you too.."
Did you study a lot?
I did not have many friends. friend..
"In fact, no friend at all."
Oh snap!
Why?
"First I was very tall, I looked older next to them , and I had dental braces until the end of junior high school."
"It's beautiful to be tall, I wanted to be tall too."
But your height is good.
Thank you!
"Your dental braces served the purpose, your teeth are very beautiful &amp;gt;Thank you!"
No one cares about Mira.
And it's understandable why Eylul left us.
Life goes on...
Thanks for the beautiful moments tonight !
Don't mention it.
"Good night, &amp;gt; The same to you."
Mom?
"I struggled a lot to reach this Mira,"
Why do they involve you?
Good heavens...
"Okay, I won't to talk about these now Orkun."
Come here!
Please!
Take me out of this nightmare.
Please I want you to be by my side today.
"Sweety I can't come now, I am at school."
I am solving the registration procedures.
You know our department has the courses selection today.
I can only come at the evening.
Let's do something at the evening.
"Anyway... good, forget about it."
"But, don't..."
Hello?
"What happened again?-Nothing, come on let's get these things done and go right away."
Where do you see yourself after five years?
"Probably I will graduate until then, I will find a job."
"A higher degree?- I don't want a higher degree or something like that, straight to the working life."
"It looks like you're in a hurry, do you have to go somewhere?"
I have one more exam today and...
I am stressed a bit because of that.
"Good, what's your life's philosophy in general?"
Not to quit the right way even in the hardest times.
Hello children.!
Do you know where is Yaman's house?
Yaman Koper?
"I don't know, do you know, dude? &amp;gt; No."
"Okay, but do you know where is the reeve?"
Thank you.
He is coming. &amp;gt; How was it?
"I don't know, Mert give me the scooter's keys."
But I'm still curious.
Chang Hui that boy...
I wonder how he will look when he shows up.
I was afraid of how you were wavering when you were with her.
Attendant Noh.
I am not wavering.
I am searching for the right path.
Your Highness!
"If I don't do that now, I will lose my way forever if I am lost later in the future."
"Right now, I want to look within myself rather than move forward."
"When I look at myself through Yi Nok's eyes, I can see the things I've been hiding."
And Hong Gil Dong gave me some advice as well.
He told me to protect the people if I wanted to be king.
Realize it?
Yi Nok!
- Try this on.
- What is this?
I borrowed this from Mae Hyang.
You should wear this next time you go to Yongmun.
How can I wear something like this?
You should learn to wear skirts now.
"You should dress like noble ladies do, and act like them."
"What's wrong with you, old man?"
"I'm a medicine peddler, Heo Yi Nok!"
The Moonlight Warrior can't wear a skirt!
"And besides, does this look noble to you?"
"Well, I suppose it is a bit sexy for a noble lady to wear."
I'll go bring something more conservative.
How am I supposed to wear this?
How embarrassing!
My colored glasses...!
We crushed the glass and used it to cut our binds.
And what does it do?
It marks a one in each of those spots.
"Now, what did I want to do?"
I wanted to check membership.
I want to do search.
Well that's simple.
"Given that representation and some value, I just say gee is it there?"
What's the order complexity here?
I know I drive you nuts asking questions?
What's the order complexity here?
"Quadratic, linear, log, constant?"
Any takers?
"I know I have the wrong glasses on the see hands up too, but..."
STUDENT:
[UNlNTELLlGIBLE]
PROFESSOR:
Who said it?
STUDENT:
Constant.
PROFESSOR:
"Constant, why?"
STUDENT:
[UNlNTELLlGIBLE]
PROFESSOR:
"Yes, thank you."
"All right, it is constant."
You keep sitting back there where I can't get to you.
Thank you very much.
It has a constant.
"Remember we said we design lists so that the access, no matter where it was on the list was of constant time."
That is another way of saying that looking up this thing here is constant.
"So this is constant time, order one."
This doesn't change anything.
What are you doing?
Pulling the plug.
No!
Rosie!
Watch it.
That was too close.
"If he had more than a drop of tritium, he could have destroyed the city."
I'm ruined.
"I have nothing left, except Spider-Man."
"He saved your life, sir."
He humiliated me by touching me.
The press will be here soon.
I suggest we move on.
What was he doing here anyway?
Molten metal penetrated the spinal cavity... ...and fused the vertebrae at multiple points... ...including the lamina and the roof of the spinal column.
We won't know the extent of the damage until we get in there.
"I suggest we cut off these mechanical arms, slice up the harness... ...and, if need be, consider a laminectomy... ...with posterior spinal fusion from C7-T1 to T1 2."
"We're ready, doctor."
Anybody here take shop class?
Help me!
Help me!
No!

What do I know?
You forget things!
And you ask me where your umbrella is!
Here is your umbrella!
Take it!
But how did it come here?
"- By plane! shekhar.. why do you always get so angry? seema, I am not angry."
You just feel so.
I am not angry. come.
According to you shekhar had 4 suitcases.. ..when he disembarked from the boat?
- Yes!
But I saw only 2 suitcases in his house. shekhar had disappeared for sometime.
"When he returned, he got frightened when he saw me."
"I think the matter is serious. sir.. if you permit, shall we raid his place?"
"Now it""s too late!"
"We don""t have any evidence."
Listen..
"I want tight security around shekhar""s house."
And remember.. no officer should sleep on duty!
"Got it? sir, I won""t let anybody sleep! okay! - spread out! keep a close watch. stay awake."
"The thief shouldn""t escape. stay awake. keep a close watch. stay awake."

Whenever you will become the minister. keep a close watch. stay awake.
"The thief shouldn""t escape. stay awake."
"Hey, mister."
Whenever you will become the minister.
"Hey, mister."
Whenever you will become the minister.
You shouldn't have come here.
Can't we see them as they're being taken out?
- Maybe you will.
But you can't talk to them.- That'll be enough for me.
What about the girl?
She's here under control.She departed from Istanbul early.
"- So she should be already here.- Be sure, and then talk to me."
"Okay, okay, okay."
- Yes?- Where are you?
I'm here.I've arrived.
"Okay, good."
- See you at the courthouse.- Okay.
- She is here.- What about that dog?
He's on his way.He should be here shortly.
I'm going inside now.
Kadir Bey wants to talk to you.
"Fatmagül, my child.Look, this is a very difficult day for you."
"You have been waiting and preparing yourself for months, for this day."
"It was very important, and also difficultfor you to even come here."
And you managed it.
We will manage to get them punished as well.
Together we will.
You will feel very tense during the trial.
This won't be a surprise.
You will be hurt and affected negativelyby what's going to be talked about in there.
Shortly it will shake you up badly.
"You may feel prepared for anything now.But during the trial, unexpected things can happen."
"It is okay, if you don't want to come."
Trust me and believe methat I will do my best to represent you there.
Don't come to the trialif you ask me.
But the decision is yours.
"My child, it will be better for you."
I-I really don't think they liked it.
How do you know that ?
- She's already on a plane back home.
- [ Groans ]
Yeah.
"You know, guys ?"
"Maybe I'm just not good with girls, period."
"No-no-no, really-really."
Like-- Like I was born without that part of the brain.
"I mean, I can't talk to girls."
"And when I do talk to them, I screw it up."
"Yeah, well, come prom those excuses aren't going to do you any good."
- [ Sighs ]
- [ Michelle ]
"And one time at band camp, we weren't supposed to have pillow fights, but we had a pillow fight, and it was so much fun."
"A-And this one time, we all lost our music and we were supposed to play this song, but we didn't know it, so we just made it up and we kept playing and playing, and the conductor didn't know what we were doing, and it was so funny."
"-So, you're pissed about somethin', huh."
-[ Scoffs ]
You know what I do when I'm angry ?
I just play some Bach on my flute.
It's so relaxing.
- I learned to do that at band camp.
"- Hold on, uh--"
You have no idea why I'm angry ?
Is it because we have a test tomorrow ?
Sometimes I get cranky...
- when I know I have a big test to study for.
- [ Laughs ]
- Yeah.
"Yeah, that's pretty much it."
- I thought so...
- because this one time at band camp-- - W-What's your name ?
He says that we have a stronger hand now that the killer has come out.
"That's great news son, I feel light as a bird."
He says that you will definitely be free in just one session.
Inshallah...
The nightmare will be over.
"- Well, we can't say for sure."
- Kuzey...
Don't think about bad things.
Obviously there's a misunderstanding.
"Yes, son, it's not like they'll keep you here for lifetime... ... just because you called him to the forest."
Do you know anything about that man?
Who is he?
What is his story?
His name is Mirza Çeltik.
Ferhat killed that man's son.
"Actually, got him wounded."
Are you gonna allow me?
Or keep interrupting?
What?
Who says you're the only one who can talk?
"Handan Hanım, did you swallow a microphone or something?"
Why do you sound so loud?
"After the incident, the boy was never the same."
"I don't know what Ferhat did to the boy but... ... in the end, he suicided."
"- Hence, his hatred to Ferhat."
He couldn't track Ferhat until he saw his picture on the newspaper upon Ali's death.
"And then, he chased him down."
Had Ferhat served time in prison because of that?
"When you first met Ferhat, that was why he was in prison."
He could kill a man without blinking an eye... ... just because he is my lover.
He's a monster with bloody hands who does not fear any prison.
That boy was Deniz's lover.
She didn't talk about it for 20 years.
Her face-muscles were motionless.
"Everybody treat her and her mother well in Taiwan, because her father sacrificed himself."
But she says:
I'm not him.
Memory is the selection of images.
"Some elusive, other's printed indelibly on the brain."
"Daddy loves you, so much!"
I know we'll dance at every party.
Each image is like a thread. each thread woven together to make a tapestry of intricate texture. when I first met Louis I said to myself
"He is a healer, he will take care of me."
Do you still love her?
Men fought each other for the privilege of speaking her name.
And the tapestry tells a story.
And I find out he's just a man.
"You're in trouble, they're really mad."
Who them?
They always mad!
And the story is our past.
I'll never forgive you.
If you drive him away.
"The summer I killed my father, I was 10 years old."
"I saw daddy,"
Daddy and Mrs Munroe.
That's a lie!
What's wrong with her?
"Oh, she'll be alright."
Have you told anyone?
Cos if you tell I swear I'll do you harm.
You know i love my sister but she's not unfamiliar with the inside of a mental hospital.
"It's sunday, which one of your patients you gonna see Louis?"
What was wrong with that lady?
"Thanks to you, I get to experience situations that I never thought I would."
Sorry...
"But the work out seems to have had an effect, seeing how you managed to keep up so well."
"But, you knew?"
That we were following you?
It would be weird if I didn't know.
You're obvious.
I didn't have a choice.
When I found out you were going to watch a movie with Hae Ra...
Without knowing...
"But if you happen to like Hae Ra,"
That is something...
I can do nothing about.
Do you want to go somewhere?
What?
I'm asking if you want to go somewhere? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;It's like a dream... &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Me being with Seung Jo. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;With Seung Jo.
It feels like I'm having a life time of happiness on this one day.
I'm happy now
"But, it looks like only families are here."
We are the only ones who look like a couple.
Of course.
"There is a rumor that says, If a couple comes here together, they would break up in six months."
You didn't know?
What?
You didn't know?
It's well known.
"After all, we shouldn't care, since we are not dating."
You know what?
Let's just get out of here!
What to do?!
Wear it until your clothes dry.
"It's cheap, but it's better than wearing wet clothes."
Reliance.
- Reliance.
"So if there's an electricity problem in your home.. ..you will call up the Reliance office, won't you?"
You won't call Anil Ambani directly.
"Mr. Anil, we've a electricity problem."
Silence.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
"These priests, the saints are officers of God."
- No.
They aren't officers.
Officers are educated people.
They are...
"They are salesmen, Your Honour."
They are collection agents.. ..because they own God's franchise.
Your Honour.
This man's an atheist.
He doesn't know what he's saying.
"But, we are saints."
We will forgive him.
But the world will never forgive him for this grave sin.
You won't be able to set foot out of your house.. ..if you say anything else.
ls that your concern for me.. ..or are you threatening me in front of the judge?
We...are concerned for you.
They pay me up quickly.
End this matter.
"My lord, this is enough."
"The donation receipts, the submissions."
There's no agency agreement between God and my clients.
Kanji is saying baseless things.
We cannot file a case against God for such a small thing.
Small?
Everyone's looking fancy after shopping yesterday.
"Zelo, that's a very unique hat."
- I got it yesterday.
- Where'd you get it?
"I found it off the street, some US brand..."
Your hair color is very artistic
- My hair color?
- It really stands out.
- What color is it?
- It's purple.
Those sunglasses are very unique too.
"Yes, they are unique."
Your facial features are unique.
"I hear that a lot. oh, really?"
I have to buy things suitable for my age and pockets...
"I was surprised, to be honest."
They had everything I was looking for but they were all very costly.
- Limited editions are really expensive.
- The first thing that caught my eye was about 1400 dollars.
With 1400 dollars I can drink Nesquik 6000 times.
I couldn't sleep much but I came out because I wanted to shop.
"Actually, we were all washed up and ready to go to sleep."
But we all came out as soon as we heard we're going shopping.
We can only stay here for about 2 weeks.
There's no time to be sleeping.
At least one more hour...
Shopping helps a singer express more.
"Shoes too, styling for our album"
It helps us to discuss with the stylists.
We would be able to make suggestions and use those items.
I think it's a big help.
This is Hollywood.
"Let's put the meatballs in this magic box, just in case."
"- Okay, quick."
"""Comrade Dynin"""
- Come quick.
- Hold it.
"- Well, what have you got in there?"
"- Nothing, take a look."
- Some pioneers you are.
Torturing a poor bird.
"- Keep on pumping DDT, to destroy a bug or three!"
- Enough with the jokes.
No masquerade until we sanitize all the costumes.
- Won't that spoil them?
"- What's more important, clothes or the health of the children?"
- Nothing will spoil them any more.
"They've already been doused with formalin, scrubbed with pumice, and dunked into chlorine."
- I heard at another camp they also fried them with soldering irons.
- These clothes got dragged around various camps for about six years now.
- They are well-travelled costumes.
"- What's all this, now?"
- The band got relieved from nap time.
Let them practise.
- All clear.
"- Hurry up, guys."
Let's go.
- Playing on the go!
Virtuosos!
"""Boys"""
- Hurry.
- What are you guys doing here?
"- Get lost, shoo!"
Go on!
That the police are harassing people!
"Now this wedding won""t take place!"
Lajwanti!
This marriage will surely take place!
"lt""s nobody""s fault! lt""s all about destiny!"
Rajesh told me everything before marriage!
This marriage is taking place with my acceptance and consent!
Got it?
Toast!
Honeymoon in switzerland! come on!
Good luck!
"Love you! - cheers, handsome!"
What sight of love did you cast on me!
What sight of love did you cast on me!
You made my plight bad.
You made my plight bad.
Even beautiful face is a vice.
Even beautiful face is a vice.
People only cast evil sight.
People only cast evil sight.
What sight of love did you cast on me!
What can a person do when helpless?
What can a person do when helpless?
Even after knowing I am in trouble.
You have crossed your limit.
Even beautiful face is a vice.
People only cast evil sight.
What sight of love did you cast on me!
You should control your heart.
You should control your heart.
There is twilight after every dawn.
Why did you make your plight bad?
"""He was stupid."""
"""He was cruel and ruined others."""
"""Kill him cruelly."""
"""What a terrible blunder."""
"""Marriage turned into a nightmare."""
"""What a terrible blunder."""
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
I know!
"- Mom, dad!"
I would've never married you if mother hadn't pressurised me.
You've always been the biggest geek in the world.
"You don't have any style of speaking, no personality and.. ..your outfits.. - Don't say anything about the outfits, Mala."
You dare not say anything about them.
No one washes clothes like I do in entire Lokhandwala.
I am talking about wearing and not cleaning.
"And that's what will say even after I die, isn't it?"
That buy a plain cloth to cover her body.
"Oh no, I know you will stand up, throw a tantrum."
"""Couldn't you get Kanjivaram?"""
"Exactly, you didn't give me anything during my lifetime."
I will definitely ask for something after I die.
I didn't give you anything as long as you were alive?
What did you give me?
Did you even buy me a dog?
All our neighbours have dogs.
But we don't.
- I am there.
"Then why do you need a dog to secure the house, madam?"
At least the dog will keep me company.
It will go along with me.
They were selling them by the road.
You don't like it?
It's the same?
"Then, it's couple t-shirts?"
Hamburger!
I was so hungry. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;It's really good. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; Better than the delicious French or Italian food. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; I won't be able to eat such a delicious hamburger again. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; I wish time would stop right here.
Eat!
Don't just look at it
"But, why did you take my hand and run earlier?"
You were with Hae Ra. . .
That's because. . .
You were the one closest to me.
Thank you.
I keep causing trouble all the time.
I haven't really experienced something that was difficult for me.
But after you showed up...
I feel like I'm living in a completely different world.
I feel like I'm solving a sudden problem without an answer.
That may be an ordeal that I should get over.
"Something I can't avoid, something I have to solve."
Is the ordeal...possibly me?
"At first, I wondered about how to react to it and just wanted to avoid it."
"But now, I won't run from it."
"If the problem is not wrong, then there has to be an answer."
I'm going to approach it head on.
Huh?
You're going to face me head on?
If you don't get it then forget it.
"No, I get it."
"So, I am an ordeal to you and you were only trying to run away."
"But you changed your mind, and now, you are with me."
Are you proposing to me?!
"You can also begin to find out why they stick, if you want."
Why?
"What is so sticky , what is so appealing about this?"
"Why is this thought, this feeling so sticky?"
And hold this question.
Don't ask two / three questions.
Hold this question one at a time.
What is so enticing about this thought?
Ok?
"And you can see ,'Ok, because it promises that'"
"Ok, as you said before, 'that is going to bring me happiness'."
Ok.
That's the first thing you've identified now.
"Now, you find out 'bring happiness to 'who' exactly'?"
"Just this question, 'who's going to become happy?'"
"And initially, it's going to be a lot of blurring."
"'Wow, you can't see. wow', you know like,"
Something can't handle this question.
"'Who's , Who suffers?"
It's me'
No.
But don't just satisfy yourself with the assumed 'me'.
"Ask again, you know, 'who, who will, who's going to be happy?'"
And keep your attention still and hold this question.
And this stillness and focus of attention will begin to burn.
"It will begin to burn, all this noise."
Stay with it.
Stay with it.
You might find yourself going to sleep a little bit.
That's Ok.
Hold the question.
Even write it down.
We can say congratulations now.
"Let this exam's result come in the best way, let my son pass it too."
"Don't worry, Yaman will make it!"
You will see.
"Today will be a beautiful day for him, and for you too, if it's not for anyone else."
Thank you very much.- Enjoy it.
You won't have headache after you drink the tea.
"Today, my day started very bad.. but I want it to be beautiful for someone else."
Thank you very much.
Good bless you!
There are analgesics in the closet.
"No, I have my medicine."
If I say that I have also headache from the excitement...
"Come on bro, I am in hurry.- You told me to stop."
Take it.
Thank you.
Calling Yaman.
Your brother let you down.
Cut your hopes!
There were some in photo albums too but who know where they are.
The photos spread why moving from one place to another.
I will order pita.
Don't take the trouble.
I will go now.
"It can't be, you came from far away."
"I will get it and bring right away-Order it, of course."
Your must have headache from hunger.
It's obvious you didn't eat anything.
Eylül calling.
:
Actually I can't look you in your face.
I disgraced mysself that night.- After that night so many disgraces happened that... don't worry at all.
1 cup of sugar.

The color that you like.
This is optional.
If you don't have an popcorn maker.

Also add a little bit of dye.
"Well guys, when the popcorn start to popping."
It's just pay attention and mix.

Thanks for watching.
I'm here today representing a team of artists and technologists and filmmakers that worked together on a remarkable film project for the last four years.
And along the way they created a breakthrough in computer visualization.
So I want to show you a clip of the film now.
Hopefully it won't stutter.
"And if we did our jobs well, you won't know that we were even involved."
Voice (Video):
I don't know how it's possible ... but you seem to have more hair.
Brad Pitt:
Chandra:
"So, do they ask you then?"
I'll make it clear.
It's before we start dating.
They'll know that I'm an asexual person.
"And I'll make it clear when we're, you know, when we're still in the friend stage."
Elisabeth:
Do they see it as a challenge?
"Do they think, ""Well, I'm gonna get him to be sexual."" ?"
[laughter]
David:
"A couple people have, but it hasn't worked out."
Star:
"So, do you not have sex?"
"I mean, do asexual people not have sex at all?"
No sexual contact?
David:
"There's a couple of aexual people who, kind of as a compromise because they're in a relationship with sexual people."
It's not like a code.
It's not like we kick you out or something.
Joy:
"Well, let me ask you something."
[laughter]
Do you ever have sex with yourself?
[laughter]
David:
It's a valid question.
[laughter]
"Perfectly, perfectly, valid question."
[applause]
Joy:
You may not be attracted to anyone else but that doesn't mean you're not attracted to yourself.
My dear!
Why dont you please relent?
If you are angry you will not walk with me till the end
Will you drench me instead of being my umbrella
You are the rain who throws away the umbrella
When I look beyond the curtains .. ..
I found that my impression in your heart.
Since I know the value of love I did not forget like you.
He is always thinking about me but does not talk to me
Even a second lost will never come back
Bye.
"Hey, I am talking to you."
Why are you thundering?
Do you think I am afraid of you?
"Even if you thunder, eventually you have to come to me."
"Hey, I am talking to you."
Cant you hear?
Are you deaf?
Dont make such a fuss.
I know that you also want to speak to me.
You are only trying to placate your ego.
Come to me now.
"Hey rain, you were the witness when a big man promised me.. ..that he will keep me in his heart and my ring on his finger."
He kept the promise too.
I also promised that whenever you come I would hug him.
Should I not keep my promise now?
Even if he is angry with me I am going to hug him.
Venkat!
What is the use of killing a minion like you.
I am sparing your life.
Go and tell him that he cannot harm.. ..even a single strand of my hair.
"Uncle, why are you looking at me like that?"
This is step 2.
"OK, what is this?"
"In the figure above, three wires are braided."
"That is, by starting in the order A, B, C--"
"OK, so this is A, B, C-- and then the order changes to B right, because the yellow line is B-- A, C."
"And then we get B, C, A. Right?"
"There's just the order of the strings, left to right."
"Or the braids, or the wires."
OK.
"That is start with the order A, B, C, the outer left wire is brought over wire B, right?"
"This is brought over wire B, to the middle position forming the order shown in step 1."
"Than the outer right wire C, this one, is brought to the new middle position shown in step 2 and so on."
Alternately bringing each new left and each new right wire to the middle.
"At what numbered step does the braid first repeat the original order A, B, C?"
"So what you do is, you first bring the left over the middle, then you bring the right over the middle, then you bring the left over the middle, then you bring the right over the middle."
"So at step 3, what do we have to do?"
So step 1 we brought the left over the middle.
"So we went from A, B, C."
You essentially switch the left and the middle.
"And then step 2, you switch the right and the middle."
"So step 3, we switch B and C again."
Because we're back on the left-hand side.
"So you get C, B, A."
"And then step 4, you're going to switch to the right-hand side."
Step 3 we switched these two.
"Now step 4, we're going to switch these two."
"So you get C, A, B."
"Then in step 5, we're back switched on this side."
"So then you get A, C, B."
"And then step 6, you're going to switch to the right-hand side again."
"So you get A, B, C."
"So by step 6, we repeat."
Now I am employed.
As a driver?
To 25 lorries.
I am a supervisor.
"10,000 salary."
Is it enough to feed your daughter?
"I can earn 10,000 in one day if luck smiles at me."
"Do you see, because I said those words that day.. ..he became determined and got a job."
I know that you are capable.
But you need a little push.
I have given green signal to your love.
What are you doing?
Take my son-in-law inside.
I will order to print the wedding cards.
But there is a small problem.
My scooter is not starting.
Can you order to drop me since you are not the driver?
"No need, I will take my way."
Stop wearing a girls dress and.. ..let your beauty be magnified by a saree
Dont jump like a small girl and.. .. let me tie you down with a nuptial not
let me reach you quickly and.. ..let us fulfill our naughty desires hold this beauty in your embrace
"see this, how can I stop the youth.. .. when the my heart became an enemy"
Why should we feel lonely.. .. when we have each others company
Accept me as your bride
Drive away your shyness and repay this sweet debt
The girl is very delicate.
How can I touch her
It is difficult to remain alone at this age
"Here I am, twist around me"
Fulfill my desire by owning me
Hi!
How are you?
When I see you I can't help but want to tease you.
But isn't the one with the problem you?
You even drop those kinds of things.
"It's good that you two have gotten closer... but before marriage, it's good to be a little more careful."
Since Eun Jo is here too. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net
When are you going to select your major?
During my second year.
"Then, when you decide what major you're going to take..."
Will you be able to do it?
"If a bunch of people choose the same major,"
"They decide using grades, and I'll have to compete in that manner..."
But it seems that those circumstances are unlikely.
"Well, I'm just saying..."
It would be nice if you went into business.
I'm not interested in that area.
"Ah, Why?"
Please drop me off right over there.
Are you going into class?
Seung Jo!
Again?
"Hey, when you think it's going well with him..."
Why is he so fickle?!
Is he being mean again?
"This time, it feels different from the last, though."
I don't know.
"What-  I mean, you said you even kissed."
Like this... you said you hugged too.
"But, I mean, why in the world is he being like that??"
I don't know if he's interested in me or not.
It's very frustrating.
"Min Ah, don't you have any good ideas?"
To find out if he's interested in me or not.
"The kind of artists . ,, ."
I said I know they're on here somewhere cuz I watched a really good one.
"Cuz I, I only got to it through the newsletter that's why, I, I saw I clicked and went to that, you know greatest artists or something like that."
But then that's why I'm actually going to find him.
"Like what do, what do they have that under?"
"The documentary to me is uh, is kind of more like the."
Plus something for me to learn how to do a documentary.
"Uh, right."
Yeah.
"Which is, it actually being an inspiration story."
"Huh, that makes sense."
"Right, of artists."
And a featured artist or something like that would be a great place for a start.
Okay.
This is so helpful.
"You know, sometimes we just get so insular in how we loko at information that it's so helpful to hear how other people."
Consume.
Right.
"Well like I said if I meet with engineering teams, and we always get to see it then."
"It's a terrible job on your, on your back."
"Um, people like to go hiking and stuff and there's , too."
"Oh. ,, , so even we, we don't a very good job on stuff. ."
Yeah.
"We all do the best we can, and then we re-evaluate and start again."
Right.
"Yeah, but you had some good stuff too.'Cause my Dad said I'm, I'm creative on the outside ."
"I do children's illustrations, and things like that."
"So you have, like, some children's book illustrator."
Mm hm.
Programs.
The illustrating stuff is good.
I don't think .
I can't see another explanation.
Luminus Devastatus is a spell that priests unlock at the level 100.
"Yes but with the update version, it can set up a new deal."
"No, no, no, I have checked twice."
"No, wait, it's better to :"
Bandaid !
"Come here my boy, come !"
"What's going on dudes, are we going to do a new quest ?"
"No, no ,no."
We just want to know where did you got that beautiful staff.
The staff ?
"But I already told you, on Dardane."
"No, that cannot be Bandaid."
Dardane doesn't loot this kind of item.
"Yes he does, and it's Golgotha who killed him right in front of me."
"And when she left, she said she didn't need this kind of item, so I took it for myself."
"- Yeah, me, I think he is lying."
- Why would he lie ?
"I don't know, perhaps he bought the staff from Ash the chinese farmer."
And he doesn't dare to say it.
I am not Chinese !
You really think behind his blank stare there's enough grey cells to bamboozle us ?
Yes. good point.
"However, nothing can explain how the worse priest from Horizon 1.0 is able to cast level 100 spells."
"And me, I think you're jealous Omega Zell."
"What !? m-me jea, but he's insane, never ever, it's you who is jealous !"
- Why do you say that Bandaid ?
"- Yes, why do you say that ?"
"Well, because I reached level 100 before you !"
And even Tenshirock the hacker has said that I was super whacking of the dead.
He also said that I was the Chosen one !
"Wait, when did you see Tenshirock the hacker ?"
What's a joke now?
"No, I'm afraid you're going to notice everything I do."
Gee!
I don't --
Do you want me to?
"I want you to help me become more relaxed, yes, but I don't want to be so defensive with you."
I don't like to feel so defensive.
"Uh...you're acting like -- you're treating me as if I'm stronger than I am, and I want you to... protect me more, and be nicer to me."
Are you aware of your smile?
You don't believe a word you're saying.
[laughs]
"I do too, and I know you're going to pick on me for it!"
"Sure, you're bluffing, a phony."
Do you believe -- you mean that seriously?
"Yeah, if you say you're afraid and you laugh and you giggle and you squirm...that's phony."
You put on a performance for me.
"Oh, I...I resent that very much."
Can you express this?
"Yes, sir."
I most certainly am not being phony.
I will admit this.
"It's hard for me to show my embarrassment, and I hate to be embarrassed, but, boy, I resent you calling me a phony."
Just because I smile when I'm embarrassed or
"I'm put in the corner, does not mean I'm being a phony."
Wonderful.
Thank you.
You did this work for the last minute.
"Well, I'm really mad at you."
That's right.
You didn't have to cover up your anger with your smile.
"Now in that moment, in that minute, you had not a not a [indiscernible]"
"Well, at that minute I was mad at you though,"
We will burn his house.. .. with a tank full of petrol and bring Shailaja back.
Are you out of your mind?
He is not an ordinary person.
He is a powerful man in entire Telangana.
That will be our strength.
He cannot imagine .. ..that we will dare to rescue Shailu from him.
Even then we should not be careless.
With a perfect plan.. ..we should rescue her tonight.
"Bhadra, listen to me."
She is not even taking any food.
How would she possibly marry you and lead her life with you?
Dont do it.
If you decorate your feet with Mehendi.
They look beautiful with that red color.
If you decorate your hands they too look beautiful.
But dont let blood smear your hands.
It will not be nice.
I could have done anything with you.
But my father told me in his death bed.. .. not to hurt any woman.
That is why I have caused no harm to you.
But I will definitely marry you.
I dont like you.
Then whom do you like?
That Venkat who left you and ran away?
Why do you think him so much about him?
I am the person who is standing all your abuses.
Think about me.
Change your mind.
It is not me but you who has to change your mind.
"Whatever you say, my fancy for you is only increasing."
What do you ladies have?
Even kings become your slaves.
"Keep your voice low, he is the king of entire Telangana."
"Hey, where are you going?"
"- It is raining, mother."
"If your father sees you, he will.."
Your husband is busy elsewhere.
Look there.
Silk drops which make the young girl happy
Like the colorful parrots and like sugar crystals .. ..the rain drops are falling to enhance the youth
Did you remember me after such a long time
How long will you hide in the skies
You come and go like a guest
If you promise to stay with me forever.. ..I will hold you close with my hands.
If you want to come will I stop you?
O beautiful rain drop stay with me like my nose ring
O beautiful rain drop stay with me like my ear ring
"like my bangles, and anklets and.. ..like ornaments I wear everyday"
Shall I preserve you like a childhood friend?
Like the blooming youth of a girl shall I see myself in you?

Father is very serious.
He wants to see you.
Let us go.
Shall I kidnap her?
Find her details.
The train started but where is your father?
Did father not come?
What are you searching for?
My father did not board the train.
You dont worry.
By the way how does he look like?
How does he look like?
I am asking about his appearance.
"Ball, car, picture."
Can you repeat those back to me please?
"BALL, CAR AND PlCTURE."
Fantastic.
"I'm going to ask you that later, again, so try and remember please."
"Starting from 100, can you take away 7 and tell me what that is? then keep taking away 7 and tell me what the answer is each time and I'll tell you when to stop and you can stop."

Hello.
Today we are going to use fabric to make a crane.
Inflate four balloons
leaving about six inch flat tail.
I use different color balloons for this instruction.
Twist the first yellow bubble.
We are going to twist all bubbles of the same about two inch size.
Twist the first gray bubble.
Lock the free end of the first gray bubble with free end of the first yellow bubble.
Now let's connect two more balloons.
Twist the first red bubble.
Twist the first pink bubble.
Lock the free end of the first pink bubble with the free end of the first red bubble.
Twist the second yellow bubble.
Twist the second red bubble.
Lock the free ends of the second yellow and the second red bubbles in one lock twist.
OK.
Now twist the second pink bubble.
And twist the second gray bubble.
Lock the free ends of the second pink and second gray bubbles in one lock twist.
It is the bottom view of our sculpture.
Twist the third pink bubble.
Far from it!
You should be thankful that he isn't the man of your life.Look!
We came to ask if there is anything we can do for you?
Where is Faruk?
"I don't know, just left, and went away."
Maybe he threw himself somewhere. or maybe he is getting ready to throw himself.
His life- insurance will pay his debts then.
"Do something ,Selim..."
Please ..-You know that i am Ümit's lawyer.
But I'll help you.I can recommend a good lawyer for him.
We're finished.
We simply got ruined.
"Thankfully, land register of this house is on me."
Could something happen?
Could we lose this house?
It depends on amount of the debt.
"But of course, as his wife you're debt's -partner.."
God damn it...
God damn him !
This incompetent guy!
"Come here, we can go outside for a bit if you want."
Since you couldn't carry out this work successfully why did you take such a risk?
Wait let me see the dimensions of this issue tomorrow first.
"Let us first see what's the issue befor you maul yourself, right?"
I 'il check on Beeren.
Everything is clear.
"In the middle of the business world, they proved that he is a thief."
"Even if he can get out of this mess, who's going to work with him again?"
He played with the future of the children.
This is the most important thing.
It looks like Mira will go from here before than that outskirts boy.
They will go away from here.

"I, I think, I like how, that you guys are ."
"The teacher organizes nice, and bookmarks things and stuff."
"I think that's a great idea, so I can always go back to."
"It is, and also I, I haven't had a smart phone for very long."
Um-hm.
And I was surprised.
I went on there and that was really good.
"And it actually had the, uh."
"And then actually be able to watch it um, ."
Oh cool.
Yeah.
At first it had a mobile version on it.
Yep.
Beta something.
I. Yep.
So the first time I had ever looked at it and actually that worked really nicely so the mobile when .
And we have to.
"That's the way the world is going. ,, ."
"I wanna let, I mean I haven't installed, I haven't used it very frequently for that kind of purpose."
I still have my old .
"I, I'm like, wow."
"We always having to do that stiff, stuff as well, and uh you guys did that pretty nicely, the way it sits on it, ?"
"Are you, as you're looking at the USGS."
"Uh, we."
Redo.
Mm hm.
Are you talking about responsive design and the need for mobile compatibilit y?
That's come up.
I know that the directive of the White House wants the government to start making mobile devices stuff and there is a plan in place.
"It's a matter of how you take all that content because there is a lot of it, there is a large bit of it."
"It's really, it's very hard to design for it because they do every science in the world, right?"
Every type of science?
"I was hanging out with my sister the other day and I was, I was sitting in this chair, and my sister told me to stop fidgeting."
"To which I was like, A, rude, and B, I'm not fidgeting."
"I just, I really like sitting in different ways."
And I do.
"You know, if you know something about me, you know that."
So I thought I'd just quickly show you guys my favorite ways to sit on a chair.
"So to do this, I just need like, I need a chair, this one, this will do."
"I'll use this one, this will be fine."
"Basically, I mean, we can start with just a simple, a classic cheeks on the seat maneuver."
I really like to center myself.
"So I'm like, in position to sit down."
"Then I just, then I go from right here just to plopping down."
"And it, you know, like, it takes a little settling in on the sit bones to like, really find the comfort spot."
Some people find it right away.
"I have to search for it a little bit, and then you're"
"like, this is it."
And then that's it.
And you stay there.
Second move is just a little-- you guys know it.
It's the leg cross.
Knee over knee.
"I like to sit, I like to cross to the left."
"It's nice way to get, like a bit of a stretch in the glutes, as well as generally air out the situation."
There's nothing worse than a sweaty sit butt during a long meeting.
That's the worst.
"So I just, those are two."
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"Hi, Beth."
BETH HOYT:
Julie.
"Julie Klauser, everybody."
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"No, to the - We searched all the islands."
"We spent that first day just flying around the island, looking."
"So, we're coming in to land."
"Of course, it was slushy"
He touches the brakes - his right brake is froze up.
No brake.
"So, he's doing this with the 180."
You can see he's going to - didn't want to do something.
"So he said, ""Okay, hang on Brian."""
We're getting from here to the water or whatever it is.
"And he hit the rudder the other way, goosed it and shut the one brake flipped it around and goosed it."
We literally backed up to stop like that.
That was some pretty cool flying.
But I used to fly all the time with Joe.
We'd run over to the other island and we'd check and see if -
We hold all the mail on the freights from the airplane so he'd have two loads to do.
I'd jump in with him and
I'd handle the plane when I was twelve years old on the way back to Charlevoix sometimes.
I did get interested in the Air Force with stuff like that.
You actually handled a plane at twelve years?
"Oh yeah, he just flipped it over onto 195 to cross over."
I took a run at it.
"Not good, I'm sure."
But then the next day we'd help Johnny at a Model A pickup.
We all had
Model As.
"Not all of us, but 6, 7 of us had Model As."
So we went over to... the bodies at the Coast Guard station.
So we went over and picked up a map
And Kenny went with us.
"Kenny McDonough, the guy that died in Texas."
We jumped in Donegal Bay and went up to Iron Ore
Let me see.
Copy and paste it.
Let me copy and paste the next several problems.
We could just move-- be streamlined about it.
"OK, they all fit."
Good enough.
What is the equation of the line that has slope of 4 and passes through the point 3 comma minus 10?
"So if the slope is 4, we know that the line-- so just rewrite it in slope y-intercept form again. mx plus b."
They're telling us that the slope is 4.
So we know the equation of the line is y is equal to 4x plus the y-intercept.
And then we could figure out the y-intercept by substituting in this point that they say it goes through.
So it goes through the point 3 comma negative 10.
So y is equal to minus 10 when x is equal to 3.
So 4 times x. x is equal to 3.
Plus b.
So what is that?
That's minus 10 is equal to 12 plus b.
"We could subtract 12 from both sides of this equation, and we get minus 22."
Minus 10 minus 12 is minus 22.
This 12 obviously goes away.
Is equal to b.
"So the equation of our line is y is equal to 4x plus b, which we just figured out is minus 22."
4x minus 22.
That's choice A.
Problem 30.
"The date in the table show the cost of renting a bicycle by the hour, including a deposit."
"If hours, h, were graphed on the horizontal axis-- let me see if I can draw that."
"So that is on the horizontal axis I have hours, h."
So this is h.
"And costs were graphed on the vertical axis, so let me draw the vertical axis."
So cost is on the vertical axis.
What would be the equation of the line that fits the data?
It's not because of that...&amp;gt; get in..
"By the way I am sorry,yesterday your night was destroyed because of us."
It wasn't my night.- Your date with Eylul was left incomplete.
"It was not for me, Mert and Eylul had a date."
Mert didn't want to be alone as it was the first time and I had to do it.
I understood.
Ehh?...
What are we doing now?
"In fact this is the whole bazaar but there are two more places i can show, or we can go... if you want"
Then show me ...
I will be pleased... !
I wish I could see your home too.
"Okay, you're a very stubborn!"
Are you hungry?
"In fact, I didn't eat properly since yesterday."
"Let's go then, I will take you to eat the best meatballs you can ever eat in your life.&amp;gt; Okay."
It's superb..
"There is no one,who doesn't enter if this smell gets on his nose,if there is money in the pocket,can't escape this place"
Excuse me!
"- Tell me , what do you need?"
"Please , sister."
Can we have some red pepper flakes - Of course- And from those little pickle peppers if you have.
I'll bring it right away.
Shall I ask for one more portion from the grill?
"In fact my stomach is full , but my eye not."
I will share it together.
"Master, can you prepare another one in the grill please?"
"The engine is ruined , master."
"it can't be repaired, it has to be changed."
"You talk with that man, if he agrees we will get it done."
"No, impossible, it can't be done before a week."
We also had a place where we ate meatballs in the way Bodrum.
Because it is one of the best music schools of the world.
They accept very few students.
"Subtitles brought to you by Ebb and Tide Team @ viki,com"
Go Mira!
- Don't Yaman!
"Your mom saw you, it's a shame...!"
"Mira, I said go .please!- Don't do this Yaman, it's a pity for the woman..."
While that man is by her side I won't take a step to her again.
Go for the sake of your mom..
"Mira please, can you continue?"
Let's go to the other side before traffic starts or you will miss your lessons.
"You also go as soon as possible, I will send these to a reeve..."
"Look here, don't act like this!"
"See, he is in a good mood."
He came to see you from a distance.
"He is in beautiful cars,with beautiful girls.What do you want more?"
He has a real job!
I won't tell your brother you are here.
He has an opportunity to save his life.
He will take exams for a scholarship at university .. and I don't want anything to distract Yaman until then.
"Lawyer, you tell Yaman I want to see him,"
let him decide whether he will come.
You can see him only at the end of the month.
Then find a way so they keep me here until the end of the month.
"Mr. Selim, please."
"Soon I will be in front of the committee, they will send me back to jail."
"I think they should send you there, because you're more intelligent than me..."
Stay in jail like a man for 11 months.
Don't involve your brother too.
"Just this morning you were ranting man, what changed now?"
"I came back from a big mistake, Yaman."
Eylul didn't betray Mira.
"Good, so, I'm not gonna write it out, but you can write this out, ok?"
I'm gonna put dot dot dot there which means you finish the argument.
Ok?
"The other thing, of course, to check is that q and q are not zero."
Are they not zero?
"Well, by the ordered pair... the set we defined, it's not."
So you don't have to worry.
"Ok, great."
What is the second thing that you might check?
Symmetry!
"Ok q... is p coma... ok, what does that mean?"
"If p q tilde m n, does that imply, m n tilde p q?"
"First of all, do you agree that this is what we have to show?"
Good.
"Secondly, do you... can you see how you write this out?"
"Which, I won't bore you with."
"Yeah... this condition mean p m equals q n and this condition means this this equals this this, m q equals n p, is that the same thing?"
"Yes, Adam says it's the same thing, so, again, I'll let you finish that argument."
"Now, the third one is perhaps the most interesting one."
The third thing to check.
"Because if you look at it, it's actually not so obvious."
"Oh, I realize I could have used that board, but that's ok."
"Ok, this one says if p q tilde m n..."
"I gotta check that this... and if m n tilde... give me another pair of letters, maybe a b, then, is it true that p q tilde a b?"
There is a question.
Is that true?
"Ok, so this actually where it is very important to just be a little careful, ok?"
"So I'm gonna give you a hint as to how one goes, and you can verify this, ok?"
For a little bit of homework for next time.
"So one thing that you'll have to use... so try this... so, you'll have to use a property of the integers, which is the cancelation law."
"You don't have division, but it's the next best thing to division."
Ok?
"OK, so they just want to know cost as a function of hours."
So let's see.
It's a linear relationship.
We could treat this just like any other line.
So if we write it as y equals mx plus b.
I didn't even have to do this.
So y is equal to mx plus b.
"So m, or the slope, is equal to change in y over-- or let me write it differently."
Because we want it in terms of-- so we could write c is equal to the slope times the hours plus b.
"Instead of x, we have hours, and instead of y, we have the cost."
So what's the slope?
"Slope is equal to change in the dependent variable, change in cost, divided by change in the independent variable, divided by change in hours."
So let's see.
"If when our hours increased by 3, how much did our change in c go by?"
"When we go from 2 to 5, so if we say 5 minus 2, that's how much we changed in hours."
That's delta h.
Then how much did we change in cost?
Well it's 30 minus 15.
So it equals 15 over 3. which is equal to 5.
So we figured out the slope.
Slope is equal to 5.
Now we just have to figure out the y-intercept.
"So this equation, we could rewrite it as cost is equal to the slope, which is 5, times the hours plus whatever our y-intercept is."
"And then we just have to substitute one of the points in to solve for b, just like we did in the previous video."
"So let's substitute the point when h is equal to 2, c is equal to 15."
So the point 2 comma 15.
"So when h is equal to 2, c is equal to 15. c is equal to 15 when h is equal to 2."
And now we can just solve for b.
So you get 15 is equal to 10 plus b.
"Subtract 10 from both sides, you get b is equal to what?"
5.
"So the equation of this line is cost is equal to 5 times h plus our y-intercept, or plus our c-intercept we could say."
Two lines.
And what do they do.
"Well, you bring in your initial guess, you bring in your data, and all you gotta do, right, is minimize that sum."
"So all you gotta tell it is, what do you want to minimize."
"Well the sum of remember i've, this x not, our initial guess of a and b."
"And I have ax+b is my guess for my line fit, minus the actual values, square it, sum it."
"Well, I don't need an absolute value here, by the way, right?"
"Because my data is real and I'm squaring it, okay?"
"So, if I had imaginary data, you have to be careful."
Okay?
"So I'm going to go and then it's going to return e, which is there, I'm just trying to minimize this."
"So you've given it a guess: one, one."
And it has an algorithm.
"Okay, so it's a utilization search algorithm."
It just goes to look and say I'm going to change a and b.
In such a way to minimize that thing. okay.
That's it!!!
"Now, if you go to the L-1 case, the only difference is what?"
You don't square it anymore.
"In the L-1 case, what you do, here it is."
"Now I do take the abso lute ? that I'm not squaring I just. ax+b-y, absolute value, sum."
'Kay?
Line fitting.
That's all we're doing.
Okay?
Everybody good with that?
Line fitting today?
"So, it seems like we're taking a step backwards."
"We've been recognizing dogs and cats on our computer, and now we're just doing"
line fits?
But there will be an important point to be made.
"Okay, so let's, we got those and here is our thing."
When I stack another mass on here-- so let me redraw it actually down here.
Because it's a different case.
"And I apply the same force, and now I have this new mass on here."
I'll do it in red.
This is m1.
The problem tells us that my new acceleration is 1/5 of the original acceleration.
So it's 1/5 of whatever this was.
So it's 1/5 a sub 0.
"So the question is, what is the ratio of m sub 0 to m sub 1?"
So m sub 0 to m sub 1 is equal to what?
And I'm going to keep it in abstract variables just to confuse you.
And then I'll show you that you can actually substitute numbers and the problem becomes a little easier.
And you might want to pause it and try it for yourself.
So let's work it through.
So we know we have this relationship to start off with.
"And just for simplicity, let's write what m sub 0 is in terms of F and a."
So we just divide both sides by a sub 0 and you get F sub 0 divided by a sub 0 is equal to m sub 0.
Good.
So let's just put that aside for a second.
And let's do that same relationship here with this.
"So here, this relationship tells us that F sub 0 is equal to m1 plus m0 times this new acceleration, which is 1/5 a sub 0."
"And so, if we divide both sides by this term right here, we get-- dividing by 1/5 is the same thing as multiplying by 5."
So you get 5 F sub 0 over a sub 0 is equal to m1 plus m0.
I just divided both sides by this term right here.
"Well, what's F sub 0?"
What's this?
Let me switch colors again.
What's F sub 0 divided by a sub 0?
Well it's here's.
It's what we solved for in the beginning.
We just got it from this relationship.
So we could substitute.
Did you call to ask how much I got as priests fee?
Nothing.
The marriage was cancelled due to differences between.. ..the two parties.
We are returning in the same bus.
The boys people are at the back.. .. and the girls people on the right.
I and Shambu are suffering in between them.
Why should it not be cancelled?
It is a love marriage.
Is there any rule that lovers will never go apart?
They got separated due to a silly issue.
The groom has.. ..a temporary job but the girls side was told.. ..that it is a permanent job.
At this the girls father got angry and made the girl.. ..take the issue up with the groom in front of everyone.
At this the boys ego got hurt.
So it is an ego problem.
Because the girls side insulted them..
When did we insult them?
They only lowered our dignity.
As if they had any dignity.
"Hey priest, why should we talk with those people.. ..who do not have any status or capability?"
We are drinking scotch because we are capable.
The drinking during day time shows.. ..that theirs is a manner less family.
"You driver, stop the bus."
I will finish off this man.
Who are you to finish me?
"If I hit you, you will go sprawling."
What will you hit me?
If I take one more peg.. ..I will sleep on the seat myself.
We do not talk to idiots.
- But we are talking to idiots.
Do you mean that my teacher is an idiot?
It seems to be your opinion.
Not theirs.
"If my father did all this, why would he try so hard to bring.. ..you out of the jail?"
Do you know you would have been in jail.. .. for up to five years if he does not helped you.
Why would he do that if he wants to separate us?
Because they want that you should find fault in me.
Forget about all others.
Do you believe that I am the culprit?
Let us leave that matter now.
"Shailu, Do you believe that I am the culprit?"
What can I do but believe.
To get a job so quickly you may.
It is useless to convince you.
You began to believe.. ..your father blindly.
That is why you could not even .. ..believe me.
You dont love me any more.
I cannot be with you if you dont love me.
It is not proper for you to go to Vizag for such a small reason.
Small arguments are common among couples or lovers.
It may look like a small incident for you.. .. but it is very big concern for me.
Then also how can you break a relation?
You should convince her later when she is calm.
Convince her?
Is she a small girl?
Doesnt she have any brain?
You are behaving arrogantly.
I need not beg her.
She will come to me if she wants me.
Why are you worried so much baby?
It is just a small argument.
Is it not your fault that you raised an argument with him.. ..when he was surrounded by many tensions?
You know quarrels will increase if you let them to.. ..otherwise they will simply vanish.
After all the hard work I have done to separate them.. ..this old lady is trying to take away my fruits of success.
What are you still thinking?
"All right, number 14."
"In the xy plane, the equation you of line I is-- let me write that down-- number 14."
The equation of line I is y is equal to 2x plus 5.
"If the line m is the reflection of I in the x-axis, what is the equation of line m?"
"So I'm going to draw a graph for you, just so you understand what I'm doing."
But on the real SAT you really don't have to do this because you wouldn't want to run out of time.
"Oh man, I'm going to run out of time if I can't draw a straight line."
I'm being a stickler for this.
"Oh, I still couldn't do it."
I'll move forward.
"So this line, so y equals 2x plus 5."
"So if you remember from our slope and y-intercept modules, the y-intercept's going to be 5, right here."
And then the line's going to have a slope of 2.
Right?
So the line's going to look something like this.
That's line l.
This is line l.
"And then we want to know, they say line m is the reflection of I in the x-axis."
So reflection would kind of be the x-axis-- this is the x-axis.
"So it's like if we were looking at this in a pool of water, the reflection would be like if you took this and flipped it over the x-axis."
So the line m is going to look something like this.
Line m is going to look like this.
So a couple of things.
It's like the mirror image.
"If we flipped it, it's like we flipped it over the axis."
"So if the y-intercept here is 5, the y-intercept here is going to be minus 5."
Right?
Because we just flipped it.
"And similarly, if every one this moves up 2, right, because that's at slope."
2.
For every one we move here to the right we're going to go down 2.
So the slope is going to be the negative of this or negative 2.
So let's say that that is the x-axis.
"Actually, I drew this-- let me edit, undo."
OK.
So let me draw the x-axis.
You might realize pretty soon why I have to redo this.
"The y-axis. x, y."
All right.
So we know that a and c are negative.
"So c is the y-intercept, right?"
"When x is equal to 0, we're just left with g of x is equal to c."
So c is the y-intercept.
"So if c is less than 0, we know that the y-intercept is going to be below the x-axis."
It's going to be a negative number.
We know that this is c.
That's where the graph intersects the y-axis.
We also know it's going to be symmetric around the y-axis.
"Well, actually, we don't know for sure that it's going to be symmetrical around the y-axis."
"And I could go into that in more detail, but I won't."
But that's all we need to know.
It depends what the bx-- this term-- is.
But let's just ignore that for now.
And then we know that a is negative.
"So in general, you might want to prove it to yourself, you know the graph of y equals x squared."
That opens up like this.
And the graph of y is equal to minus x squared.
It goes down like that.
So a possible graph for this would look like this.
The important thing is these are the two things that you know when they tell you a and c is negative.
"It's going to be a graph that opens downwards, and it's going to intersect the y-axis in the negative area, below the x-axis."
A legitimate graph also would have looked like this.
It could have also looked like this.
It didn't actually have to be symmetric.
Why not using it ?
"For too long, we are the laughing stock of Horizon 1.0."
We have an opportunity to regain our dignity.
We can't control it !
"Artheon is right, we can't use it !"
We have to sale it at the auction house.
"No, the cheated staff must be destroyed."
"Bandaid, delete it !"
"No, I don't want to."
It'll be a waste !
Imagine how much we could earn if...
"Delete it, if not I will kick you out from the guild !"
"Ho, dictator, tyrant, fascist, communist !"
OK...
But it's really not fair at all...
"Obviously, this cheated staff is indestructible."
"I'm the only one who can destroy it, or a game master, maybe."
"But for that, he will have to delete the avatar of the owner with it."

Royal Thai General System of Transcription
"The Royal Thai General System of Transcription (RTGS) is the official system used to write Thai words into the Latin alphabet, or romanization. Thai has certain vowel and consonant sounds and other phonemic features that do not exist in English. This means that saying a syllable with a different tone or vowel length can make a completely different word. For these reasons, romanization in Thai presented many challenges. The RTGS only uses the 26 letters in the ISO standard Latin alphabet to spell Thai words. It is used on all documents that require words to be written in the Latin alphabet, including road signs, maps, applications, etc. However, it has many problems. The system does not show tones or vowel length, both of which are phonemic features of Thai. It also does not tell some of the consonant sounds apart."

Highly abundant number
"Highly abundant numbers are a type of natural number. Any natural number ""n"" is called highly abundant when a certain equation is true."
formula_1
"In this equation, ""m"" is every integer less than ""n"". ""σ"" is the sum of every positive divisor of that number."
Example.
"An example would be to use the number 5. ""σ"" of 5 is 5 + 1 = 6. Every ""σ"" less than 5, however, is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. 7 is greater than 6. This makes 5 not a highly abundant number."
History.
"Highly abundant numbers were first learned about by Subbayya Sivasankaranarayana Pillai in 1943. Work on the subject was done by Paul Erdős and Leonidas Alaoglu in 1944. Alaoglu and Erdős discovered every highly abundant number up to 104. They also showed that the number of highly abundant numbers less than ""N"" is proportional to log2 ""N""."
The first few highly abundant numbers are
There are only two odd highly abundant numbers. They are 1 and 3.
Similarities with other numbers.
"The first eight factorials are highly abundant. However, not all factorials are highly abundant. For example,"
"but there is a smaller number with larger sum of divisors,"
This makes 9! is not highly abundant.
"Alaoglu and Erdős discovered that all superabundant numbers are also highly abundant. There are, however, an infinite number of highly abundant numbers that are not superabundant numbers. This was proven by Jean-Louis Nicolas in 1969."
7200 is the largest powerful number that is also highly abundant. This is because every highly abundant number that is larger has a prime factor that divides them only once.

How Australia was settled.
"The main idea is the Out of Africa hypothesis: It says that humans developed on the African continent, and spread from there. Another important site is called Kow Swamp, in the northern part of Victoria. It consists of about twenty skeletons, which are between 5,000 and 10,000 years old. The morphology of Mungo Man is noticeably different from these skeletons. For this reason, some researchers have said that Australia was probably settled twice. The settlers were probably descendants of Homo erectus and came from the Asian mainland. This theory is based on the analysis of mitochondrial DNA. If this is true, the two lines, that of Mungo Man and that of modern humans, separated a long time ago. This would also mean that Mitochondrial Eve of this line and that of modern humans would be older than mitochondrial Eve of all living humans."

Grape juice
Grape juice comes from crushing and blending grapes into liquid form. Sugars in grape juice allow it to be used for a sweetener.

Who is a Jew?
"Who is a Jew? () is the basic question about the identity of Jews, or in other words: which people are considered to be Jewish."
Question of race?
"The definition of who is a Jew may depend on a few things. Because Judaism has no specific race, it can include characteristics of an ethnicity, religion, and citizenship, and so the definition of who is a Jew is not specific."
"This question has been a subject to legal arguments, especially in Israel but also outside of it. There have been court cases in Israel since 1962 which had to address the question. In addition, the United Kingdom and other countries has had to consider whether the question was a racial issue or not."
In Nazi Germany.
It was an important question to the Nazi party in Germany. The Nazis decided who a Jew was with the Nuremberg Laws.
My mom is Jewish or I converted.
The question is based on the person's genealogy. Simple definition: a person is a Jew either by birth (in any case if one's mother is Jewish) or by religious conversion.
Other ideas.
"However, some disagree. Therefore, the following need to be taken into account:"

Third Punic War
"The Third Punic War (149 BC to 146 BC) was the third and last of the Punic Wars. It was fought between the former Phoenician colony of Carthage, and the Roman Republic."
"The war was a much smaller engagement than the two previous Punic Wars, and was mostly just the Romans attacking the city of Carthage in the Battle of Carthage. The Romans killed or captured all the people living inside of the city and tore down the buildings. They did this because they hated the Carthaginians after fighting two other wars with them, and didn't want to fight another, so they totally destroyed them."
Punic Wars
"The Punic Wars were a series of conflicts fought between Rome and Carthage between 264 and 146 BC. They were probably the largest wars in the ancient world. The term ""Punic"" comes from the Latin word ""Punicus"" (or ""Poenicus""). This was the word the Romans used for the Carthaginians, due to their Phoenician ancestry."
The main cause of the Punic Wars was the clash of interests between the existing empire of Carthage and the expanding Roman Republic. What was at stake was control of the trading around the Mediterranean sea. Carthage lost the three wars.
Context.
"Carthage was a trading nation founded by Phoenicians. It was the dominant sea power in the western Mediterranean. It was a maritime empire, in contrast to the land-based Roman empire. The Romans decided they needed Sicily, which was then in Carthaginian hands. The consequence was a series of wars which lasted over a hundred years, and ended in the utter destruction of Carthage."

Formation and early years.
"Notts County started in 1862. The club was started before The Football Association and in the beginning they played a game with club rules, rather than association football. When it started, Notts County, like most sports teams, were considered to be a ""gentlemen-only"" club. Notts County are thought to be to be one of the starters of the current game, even being credited with the invention of the offside trap. Notts County is the oldest of the world's professional association football clubs (There are older professional clubs in other codes of football.)"
"The club in the beginning played at Park Hollow at Nottingham Castle. In December 1864, the decision was made to play games against outside teams, and it was decided that the club needed to find a larger stadium. After playing at several places, The Magpies settled at Trent Bridge Cricket Ground in 1883. When the ground was used for Cricket, they played at Castle Ground or Nottingham Forest's Town Ground. The club moved to their current stadium, Meadow Lane, in 1910."

"When his brother Oswald was killed in 642, the overlordship died with him. Oswald had been king of a combined Bernicia, Deira and Lindsey (kingdom). But Northumbria was divided back into its earlier weaker sub-kingdoms. Penda, now the most powerful king in England took Lindsey. Oswiu became King of Bernicia. Oswine claimed Deira, preventing Oswiu from keeping it with Bernicia. A year after it happened Oswiu recovered parts of his brother's body from the battlefield where he died. Oswiu had Oswald's arm enshrined in his royal centre at Bamburgh and his head was taken to Lindisfarne."
"Oswiu invaded Deira in 651 seeking to reunite Deira with Bernicia. Oswine was betrayed by one of his own noblemen and was murdered in 651 on Oswiu's orders. But the Deirans chose Athelwald, Oswiu's nephew, as their king. Athelwald then aligned himself with Oswiu's enemy, Penda. Deira was under the protection of Mercia for the next three years. But Penda was determined to defeat Oswiu and take Bernicia as well. In 654 Penda raised a large army of some thirty 'legions'. According to Bede, Penda attacked Oswiu several times. With a much smaller force Oswiu attacked Penda's army near the banks of the River Winwaed. Most of the commanders of the thirty legions were killed including King Anna of East Anglia and Penda. From this time Oswiu became the or overlord over all the southern English people including Mercia. Mercia was then divided. North of the River Trent was controlled directly by Oswiu. He made Peada of Mercia, Penda's son, king over the part of Mercia south of the Trent. Peada had married Oswiu's daughter, Alflaed. Peada was murdered five months later by Alflaed, possibly on Oswiu's orders. Mercians rebelled against Oswiu and Peada's brother Wulfhere became king of Mercia."
Easter controversy.
"When Oswiu and Eanflaed were married, he was raised in the Celtic church while she was raised in the Roman church. The main difference was how each calculated the date of Easter. Members of the Celtic church might be celebrating Easter while the Roman church was celebrating Lent. In 658 his son Alfrith, who now supported the Roman Church, replaced several of his Celtic church officials with those from the Roman church."
"To resolve the differences between the two religions in his kingdom, Oswiu called for a in 664. Called the Synod of Whitby it was to decide on when to celebrate Easter and what rules the monasteries in Northumbria would follow. Members of the church were summoned from all over the north. The Roman position was given by Wilfrid who would afterwards become Bishop of Northumbria. Bishop Colmán argued for the Ionan calculation of Easter given them by Columba, founder of their order. Oswiu made the decision in favor of the Roman practice, uniting Northumbria under one religion. It joined Northumbrian religious practices to those of the southern English."
"Bede, in his ""Ecclesiastical History"", Book IV, chapter 5 gives the date of Oswiu's death as 15 February, 670 and his age at 58. His wife Eanflaed retired to the monastery at Whitby. This is where their daughter, also named Enflaed, was brought up. In 680 Enflaed and her daughter became joint abbesses at Whitby. Enflaed died ."

Throughout all of T""he Force Awakens"" and the first two acts of ""The Last Jedi,"" Ren wants to be fully committed to the dark side, but there are times where the light side tries to pull him back in. This can be seen because when he kills his father Han, he hesitates before he does it. Even when he has a chance to kill his mother Leia, he chooses not to after giving it thought.

In the next ten years, she had five children (a sixth was stillborn). One of her children was John Quincy Adams, the sixth President of the United States."
Political involvement.
"Adams was a vital confidant and adviser to her husband John Adams. She opposed slavery and supported women's rights. In 1776, her husband participated in the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia. There, Adams wrote her most famous letter to the Founding Fathers ""remember the ladies."""

A Midsummer Night's Dream
"A Midsummer Night's Dream is a play by William Shakespeare. The exact date the play was written is unknown. It is generally accepted that the play was written in 1595 or 1596. It was first printed in 1600. In 1623, the play was printed in the First Folio, a collection of all of Shakespeare's plays."
"Shakespeare's sources include works by Plutarch, Apuleius, Ovid, Geoffrey Chaucer, and Edmund Spenser. He found a description of Puck in Reginald Scot's ""The Discoverie of Witchcraft"" (1584). It is generally believed that the play was written for the festivities surrounding the aristocratic marriage of either Elizabeth Vere, Lord Burghley’s granddaughter, in 1595, or Elizabeth Carey, daughter of Sir George Carey, in 1596."
"The play is about four confused young lovers, a group of clumsy workmen, the royal court of Duke Theseus, and the royal fairy court of King Oberon and Queen Titania. The play is set mostly at night in the woods near Athens."
"The history of the British Empire has added to the spread of English. English is an important language in many places today. In Australia, Canada, India, Pakistan, South Africa, and the United States, among others (like those in the Commonwealth of Nations), English is the main language. Because the United Kingdom (the country where England is) and the United States have historically been powerful in commerce and government, many people find it helpful to learn English to communicate in science, business, and diplomacy. This is called learning English as an additional language, English as a Second Language (ESL) or English as a Foreign Language (EFL)."
"English literature has many famous stories and plays. William Shakespeare was a famous English writer of poems and plays. His English is Early Modern English, and not quite like what people speak or write today. Early Modern English sounded different, partly because the language was beginning a ""great vowel shift"". Later, many short stories and novels also used English. The novel as we know it is first seen in 18th century English. Therefore, today, many famous songs and movies (cinema films) use the English language."
Grammar.
"English grammar started out based on Old English, which is considered to be a Germanic language. After the Norman French conquered England in 1066, parts of the Latin language were brought to the English language by the Norman French."
Nouns.
"There are different types of nouns in English, like proper nouns and common noun. To show if a noun is plural, which means there is more than one of the noun, usually ""-s"" is added at the end of a word."
Pronouns.
Pronouns are words that take the place of a noun to avoid repetition. There are different types of pronouns in the English language. The most important ones are:
Verbs.
"Verbs in English show the action or the state of a sentence. Verbs can come in different shapes in a sentence based on the time or condition we are talking about. For example, the verb ""eat"" changes to ""ate"" in past."
Adjectives.
"Adjectives are words that describe a noun. In English they always come before a noun to give you more information about that noun. You can see this in the sentence ""the red apples are juicy."""
Spelling.
"Written English uses a range of historical spelling patterns that changed over time due to political and cultural changes. As a result, different words can use the same letters and combinations for very different sounds. For example, ""-ough"" was once a guttural but has become different in ""through"" (threw), ""rough"" (ruff), ""dough"" (doe) or ""cough"" (coff)."
Many English-speaking countries spell words differently. Some words that are spelled one way in the United Kingdom and many other countries in the British Commonwealth are spelled differently in the United States.
Alphabets.
There are 26 letters in the English alphabet:
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
Vocabulary.
"Nearly 60% of the vocabulary in the English language comes from Latin and its descendants, mainly French:"
"However, the most common words are more often those of Germanic origin. Also, expressions and typical short phrases are often of Germanic origin."

Turkey
"Turkey officially the Republic of Türkiye, is a transcontinental country located mainly on the Anatolian Peninsula in Western Asia, with a small portion on the Balkan Peninsula in Southeast Europe. It shares borders with the Black Sea to the north; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iran to the east; Iraq to the southeast; Syria and the Mediterranean Sea to the south; the Aegean Sea to the west; and Greece and Bulgaria to the northwest."
"Turkey is a republic. There are 81 provinces in Turkey. The money of Turkey is called the Turkish Lira. The capital city is Ankara, a city in the central region, called Anatolia. The cultural and economic centre is in the European side of Istanbul. In the past Istanbul was called Constantinople. The republic was founded in 1923, after World War I and a war of independence (""Kurtuluş Savaşı""). Before that, Turkey was the core of the Ottoman Empire."
"Many civilisations were in the area that is now Turkey, like the Hittites, the Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire. Many important events in the history of Christianity happened in places that are now in Turkey. Because it lies in both Europe and Asia, some people see Turkey as the ""door"" between them."
"Bilal ibn Rabah (, also called Bilal al-Habashi) was an Ethiopian born in Mecca in the late 6th century, sometime between 578 and 582.Bilal was an Ethiopian slave. Bilal's owner was Umayyah ibn Khalaf, an enemy of Islam. When Bilal learned about Muhammad and became Muslim, his master started punishing him. When Muhammad heard about this, he ordered Abu Bakr to buy Bilal's freedom and Bilal -who was now free- joined Muhammad's companions."
"Muhammad choose Bilal as the first muezzin. A muezzin is someone who leads the call to daily prayer. Sometimes Bilal walked the streets to call Muslims to come to prayer but most of the times, he said the Adhan from the top of the mosque."
"Some years later, when the Muslim army walked towards Mecca, everyone ran to their homes and closed all doors and windows. They were afraid that the Muslims were going to kill them, because of the bad things they did to the Muslims many years ago. But, the Muslims went towards the Kaaba, the worship house believed to be built by Abraham and his elder son, Ishmael. Bilal, shouted out loud to the people of Mecca that they were all safe: ""All those who lay down arms are safe. All those in the house of Abu Sufyan are safe. All those behind closed doors are safe."""
"After Muhammad died, Bilal never said the Adhan again - except on two occasions. Once in Syria and the second time, in Medina, when Muhammad's grandson, Hasan ibn Ali asked him to do so."
Bilal died in Damascus between 638 and 642 (AD).
Legacy.
Hadith books are the collections of Muhammad's sayings.
Muhammad used to say about Bilal:
"When Bilal was chosen as the Muezzin, some people complained to Muhammad. They believed only an Arab can be a Muezzin, because Bilal could not pronounce the Arabic words correctly and he used to pronounce ""s"" instead of ""sh"". When Muhammad heard their complaint, he said:"
Aisha
"Aisha bint Abu Bakr (604-678; ) was the third wife of Muhammad. Aisha is given honour in Islam, especially in the Sunni branch. She is often called by Muslims ""Umm-al-mu'minin"" which means ""the Mother of the Believers""."
Aisha was the daughter of Abu Bakr of Mecca. Aisha was six years old when she was betrothed to Muhammad. (Marriage under the age of 21 was common worldwide at the time) She was not Muhammad's only wife.
"Her ten-year marriage to Muhammad ended when he died. Aisha lived fifty more years in and around Medina. Much of her time was spent learning the Quran, and the Sunnah of Muhammad."
Deputy
"A deputy is a person who helps someone do their job when they are not there. ""Deputy"" is a rank or title. It usually refers to someone who is ""second-in-command"". For example: a ""Deputy Master"" is someone who will take over the responsibilities of the Master when the Master is not there. A ""deputy conductor"" will conduct an orchestra when the main (principal) conductor is not there. It is similar to an ""assistant"". Someone who is working as a deputy will deputize (stand in for someone else)."
"Sometimes other terms are used such as ""vice"". A vice-president will take over the responsibilities of the president when he (or she) is not there or is ill."
André Previn
"André Previn (born Andreas Ludwig Prewin; April 6, 1929 – February 28, 2019) was a German-American pianist, conductor, and composer."
Life.
"André Previn was born as Andreas Ludwig Priwin to a Jewish family in Berlin, Germany. He may have been born in 1930, but cannot be sure as his birth certificate was lost when he emigrated to the United States with his family in 1939 to escape the Nazis. He became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1943."
When he arrived in America he lived in Los Angeles. He started to be well known by composing movie scores for Hollywood movies.
"In 1967, Previn became conductor of the Houston Symphony Orchestra and in 1968 conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra. He stayed with the LSO for eleven years. His television series ""André Previn's Music Night"" helped to make classical music popular in Britain. From 1976 to 1984, Previn was conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO), with whom he made another television series called ""Previn and the Pittsburgh"". He was also principal conductor of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra."
"In 1985 he became conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, but because of disagreements he resigned in 1989."
Previn made many recordings and composed many movie scores and other musical works. He also toured and recorded as a jazz pianist. Later he concentrated on composing classical music.
"Previn received many prizes and honours. In the United Kingdom he was knighted in 1996. He is particularly remembered in Britain for a guest appearance he made on the Morecambe and Wise Christmas Show in 1971 where Eric Morecambe (who called him Andrew Preview) pretended to play the Piano Concerto by Edvard Grieg with Previn conducting. When Previn told him he was playing all the wrong notes, Morecambe grabbed him by his jacket and said that he was playing ""all the right notes, but not necessarily in the right order""."
Personal life.
Andre Previn was married five times. His fifth marriage was to the German violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter for whom he wrote a violin concerto. They divorced in 2006.
"Previn died on February 28, 2019 at home in Manhattan aged 89."
Mills is openly gay.
Mitochondrial Eve
"Mitochondrial Eve is a term from genetics and human evolution. It refers to a woman, whose mitochondrial DNA is a parent of all living humans. To put this more exactly, she is the female most recent common ancestor of all humans alive at present."
How this is decided.
"Rather than use full DNA comparisons, two simpler methods are used:"
This gives haplogroups (a haplogroup is a combination of genes on different chromosomal regions that are closely linked and tend to be inherited together).
The results.
"According to current research, Mitochondrial Eve lived about 200.000 years ago. Most likely she lived in East Africa, when ""Homo sapiens sapiens"" (anatomically modern humans) were developing as a population distinct from other human sub-species."
"Mitochondrial Eve lived later than ""Homo heidelbergensis"" and the emergence of ""Homo neanderthalensis"", but earlier than the out of Africa migration."
"The dating for 'Eve' was a blow to the multiregional hypothesis, and a boost to the hypothesis that modern humans originated relatively recently in Africa and spread from there, replacing more ""archaic"" human populations such as Neanderthals. As a result, the latter hypothesis became dominant."
King Ghidorah
"King Ghidorah is a fictional monster who appears in movies from Japan. He first appeared in ""Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster"". Since then, he has appeared in several ""Godzilla"" movies. He is a golden three-headed dragon with no arms, large wings, and two tails. He is the strongest monster in the ""Godzilla"" movies."
Piano Sonata No. 11 (Mozart)
"The Piano Sonata No. 11 in A major, K. 331 is a piece of music for the piano. It was written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. It was published in Vienna, Austria by Artaria in 1784. It is the second of a group of three piano sonatas. Mozart probably wrote the group in Salzburg in the summer of 1783. It was then that he brought his wife Constance (Weber) to his hometown to introduce her to his father Leopold. The first sonata in the group is No. 10 in C major, K. 330. The third is No. 12 in F major, K. 332. Mozart numbered this group of sonatas 1 through 3. He spent much time teaching during his early years in Vienna. It is likely that these sonatas were written for his pupils."
"The A major sonata is unique among Mozart's piano sonatas. It does not include a movement in sonata form. The first movement is a lilting theme in 6/8 followed by six variations in A major and A minor. The last variation is in 4/4 time. The second movement is a Menuetto in A major with a contrasting section (called a Trio) in D major. It is written in 3/4 time. The third and final movement is the famous ""Alla Turca"" (Turkish March or Turkish Rondo) in 2/4 time. It is considered one of the finest examples of Viennese Turkish music that was produced in the late 18th century. The rondo's rolled block bass chords suggest the drum rolls of a Turkish Janissary band. In true classical style, the rondo alternates between major and minor keys, and loud and soft dynamics. The piece is a favorite for amateur recitals."
Sandy Dennis
"Sandra Dale ""Sandy"" Dennis (April 27, 1937-March 2, 1992) was an American actress. She received two Tony Awards for acting. She performed mostly in theater and movies.

Tomaso Albinoni
"Tomaso Giovanni Albinoni (8 June 1671 – 17 January 1751) was a Venetian composer. He wrote operas and instrumental music. He is best remembered as the composer of a work called ""Adagio in G Minor"". Albinoni did not actually write the Adagio."
Life.
"Albinoni was born in Venice. He learned to play the violin and to sing. It is not known who his teachers are. His first opera, ""Zenobia, regina de Palmireni"", was performed in Venice in 1694."
"In 1705, he married Margherita Rimondi, a soprano singer."
"He became famous and he performed his operas in many Italian cities, including Venice, Genoa, Bologna, Mantua, Udine, Piacenza, and Naples. He also wrote and published instrumental music during this time. Albinoni did not try to find a job in a church or a court. He remained an independent composer and published music on his own."
"He retired from writing music after 1741, and died in Venice in 1751."
Music.
"Most of Albinoni's operas are lost. This is because he did not publish his operas during his life. His instrumental music has survived. Nine collections of instrumental music were published. Because of this, he is better known for writing instrumental music today. He is the first Italian composer to publish an oboe concerto."
"He was known by Johann Sebastian Bach, who wrote at least two fugues based on themes by Albinoni."
Voiceless alveolar fricative
"The voiceless alveolar fricative is a type of consonant. The letter for this sound in the International Phonetic Alphabet is ⟨⟩. The X-SAMPA symbol for this sound is ⟨s⟩. The English language has this sound, and it is the sound represented by 's' in ""sun"" and ""sorry""."
List of numbers
"This is a list of numbers. This list will always be not finished. This happens because there are an infinite amount of numbers. Only numbers will be added. Numbers can be added as long as they are popular in math, history or culture."
"This means that numbers can only be if they are a big part of history. A number isn't if it is only related to another number. For example, the number (3,4) is a number when it is a complex number (3+4i). When it is only (3,4), however, it's not notable."
Natural numbers.
Natural numbers are a type of integer. They can be used for counting. Natural numbers can also be used to find out about other number systems. A negative number is not a natural number.
"0 is argued on whether or not it is a natural number. To fix this, people use the terms ""non-negative integers"", which cover 0 and ""positive integers"", which does not."
History.
"Brooklyn is named after a Dutch town called ""Breukelen"". Dutch people were the first people from Europe to live in the area. When they got there, there were already some Native American people living there called the Lenape. The Dutch started the town in 1634 as part of the colony of New Netherland."
"During the 19th century Brooklyn expanded and filled Kings County. It remained a separate city before the people there voted to join New York City in 1898. Today, many parts of Brooklyn are home to people who are mostly from one culture or ethnicity. Other parts are mixed."
"The Brooklyn Bridge is old and famous. It goes over the East River and connects Downtown Brooklyn to Lower Manhattan. The longest bridge in New York, the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in Bay Ridge connects Brooklyn to Staten Island."
Cornish language
Cornish (Cornish: Kernewek) is a very old language from Cornwall in the southwest of England. Cornish is a Celtic language and is very similar to Welsh and is related to Gaelic.
History.
"A long time ago, Cornish was the only language spoken in Cornwall, but more and more people began to speak English, instead of Cornish. In 1550, when the prayer book was written in English instead of Latin, the Cornish people got angry and there was a rebellion. Because many Cornish-speakers died and they would now hear the Bible in English, Cornish was used less and less."
"By 1800, only a few people could speak Cornish, and since no one spoke it to one another any more, Cornish became endangered."
"People say that a woman called Dolly Pentreath was the last person who could speak Cornish. That is not quite true, but she was one of the last people to use it instead of English."
Methods of spreading.
"Some people learned about Cornish by traveling around talking to people who could still speak it and by reading old plays and books. Some people wanted to learn the language and speak it and so in 1904 a learned man, Henry Jenner, wrote a book to help people. Some people then began to learn the language and speak it again."
Today.
"No one knows how many Cornish-speakers there are now. People think that about 8,000 to 13,000 people probably speak Cornish. Some young people have grown up speaking it. Most people in Cornwall know a few sentences or words in Cornish. In 100 years, Cornish has grown from almost no speakers to many thousands, which is very exciting for many people."
"There are now many new books, films and songs in Cornish. The Bible has now been translated into Cornish. There is an event, the open Gorseth, with a story and poetry competition. Sometimes, Cornish is used in churches."
"There used to be a problem with Cornish: three different dictionaries had different spellings, and people did not agree about how to write words or say them. That was confusing for people when they have not been speaking for long. In 2008, people who used different types of Cornish came together and agreed on a new standard form of Cornish to be used everywhere."

Watergate scandal
The Watergate scandal was a serious scandal during and after the 1972 presidential election.
"A United States President and Republican, Richard Nixon was running for election against Democrat George McGovern. Afterwards, Frank Wills, a security guard, discovered clues that former FBI and CIA agents broke into the offices of the Democratic Party and George McGovern months before the election. They secretly listened to phone lines and stole several important documents."
"When these men were found, they were discovered to have been associated with Nixon. He had helped them cover all the evidence of the scandal, and may have even hired the men to begin with. ""The Washington Post"" was a newspaper which played a big role in exposing the misdoings, specifically aided by reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. This showed the public that Nixon was not as trustworthy as he seemed."
"Nixon chose to resign from office on August 9, 1974 because he wished not to be impeached. This means that he might have been charged with crimes. The U.S. Congress could not impeach him if he resigned. After this, Gerald Ford, his vice-president, became the President by default. Ford pardoned Nixon for all of his crimes later on. The name ""Watergate"" comes from the hotel in Washington, D.C. where the first crime and break in took place, and is often associated with political scandals."

At that time she resembled a typical rag doll, complete with freckles, a mop of red yarn hair, and a strawberry printed bonnet but the unique selling point was that, she smelt of strawberries. The Strawberry Shortcake line of characters each had their own fruit or dessert-themed name with clothing to match, and they each had a dessert or fruit-named pet. Like the Strawberry Shortcake doll, all the other characters’ dolls had hair scented to match their dessert theme."

Gameplay.
"""Mario Party 5"" plays the same as the first four ""Mario Party"" games. Players go around on boards to collect coins, which they can use to buy stars. Movement is done with the use of a dice block with the numbers one through ten. After all four players take their turns, a mini-game is played. The player that wins the mini-game wins coins. The winner is the player with the most stars at the end of the game. Boards have different types of spaces, including blue spaces which add coins, red spaces which take away coins, and Bowser Spaces which causes Bowser to appear and do a bad event. The game introduces the DK Space, where Donkey Kong appears to cause an event to happen. Unlike Bowser events, these events are always good. Also new to the game is the Capsule system, which replaces the item system from past games. Capsules are containers that hold a single item. Players can get capsules by passing by the ""Capsule Machine"" on the board. Each capsule does something different, including increasing the number of dice blocks a player can roll, and taking away coins from an opponent. Capsules can be thrown up to ten spaces away."
"Ten characters are playable. New to the series as a playable character are Toad, Boo, and Koopa Kid. Because of the addition of the DK Space, Donkey Kong is no longer a playable character."
"In addition to the main party game, players can also play a mode called Super Duel Mode. In Super Duel Mode, players build a battle vehicle to use in tournaments or fight against friends. Players are able to change their vehicle by using different parts. Parts can be bought with the points from mini-games."

Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution
"Adopted on March 30, 1870, the Fifteenth Amendment (Amendment XV) to the United States Constitution granted African-American men the right to vote. It was one of the Reconstruction Amendments."
Background.
Nowhere in the original Constitution or the Bill of Rights were Americans given the right to vote. The Fifteenth Amendment gave African-American men the right to vote. But not until the 1960s did judicial interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment conclude the right to vote was a fundamental right of all citizens.
The reasons behind the omissions of voting rights in the Bill of Rights and Constitution is that including them would have been too controversial at the time. Each state had different rules for who could vote. Some allowed free blacks the right to vote. Others allowed women the right to vote. A few states required ownership of property in order to vote.
"In the Election of 1868, Republican Party candidate, Ulysses S. Grant, won the presidency by only a narrow majority of the popular vote. He received support from free black voters in the South. Without that support, he probably would have lost the election. At the time blacks could not vote in the Northern states. The Republican party needed help to stay in power and thought that black votes would help. At the time Republicans controlled both the Senate and House. The proposed amendment was passed by Congress in 1869 and sent to the states for ratification. It was quickly ratified by three-quarters of the states in early 1870. Part of the reason why is that Republicans also controlled the state governments in the South. Southern Democrats were not able to block the measure."
Results.
"After passage, the Fifteenth Amendment did not have much of any impact on black voting in the South for nearly a century. Southerners used various methods including terrorism, poll taxes and grandfather clauses to prevent blacks from voting. Congress and the Supreme Court repeatedly struck down voting restrictions. For example, in a landmark decision in ""Smith v. Allwright"" (1944), The Court decision made it unconstitutional to keep African-Americans from voting in a Democratic Party primary in Texas. Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1957 which stated that all Americans had the right to vote, including African-Americans. But overcoming these problems on a case-by-case basis was proving to be unsuccessful. As soon as one form of discrimination was stopped, a new one appeared in its place. The Voting Rights Act of 1965, removed further barriers to minorities voting. It was amended five times by Congress to extend its protections as needed."
Solar eclipses on Mars
"The two moons of Mars—Phobos and Deimos—are much smaller than the Moon, greatly reducing solar eclipses on that planet."
Eclipses.
Phobos.
"Phobos is only 20 by 25 km (12 by 16 mi) and has a rapid orbital motion, so someone on Mars would only see the solar eclipse for no longer than about thirty seconds. Phobos also takes only 7 hours 39 minutes to orbit Mars, while a Martian day is 24 hours 37 minutes long, meaning that Phobos can create two eclipses per Martian day."
Deimos.
"Deimos is too small, 15 by 10 km (9.3 by 6.2 mi), to cause an eclipse. The best someone on Mars would see would be a small object passing the Sun."
View from Earth.
"Both moons are too small to cast a shadow on Mars that can be seen from Earth. However, since the creation of artificial satellites, the shadow of Phobos on Mars has been seen."
War of the Oranges
"The War of the Oranges, or the War of the grapefruit was a brief conflict in Alentjo in 1801. French and Spanish troops invaded Portugal."

"Bosley Crowther did not like the movie. He wrote, ""The script was obviously written to bring [Wyman] and Mr. Hudson, who made a popular twosome in the ""Magnificent Obsession"", together again. Solid and sensible drama plainly had to give way to outright emotional bulldozing and a paving of easy clichés."""

Pus
"Pus is a fluid that is created as a result of certain inflammations in vertebrates. In vertebrates, white blood cells fight the inflammation. Neutrophils destroy the agents that cause the infection, for example bacteria, macrophages engulf and neutralise these agents. Pus is made of dead neutrophils and macrophages, mostly. In most cases, pus is the result of bacterial infection, but it can also result from other conditions, such as psoriasis."
Leptin
Leptin is a hormone made by cells in fat tissue that reduces hunger. That helps the energy balance in the body.
"Leptin is opposed by the actions of the hormone ghrelin, the ""hunger hormone"". Both hormones act on receptors in the hypothalamus. They adjust appetite to get energy homeostasis."
"In obesity, a decreased sensitivity to leptin comes up. This leads to a feeling of hunger, despite high energy stores."
"Although regulation of fat stores is the primary function of leptin, it also plays a role in other physiological processes. These additional functions are still being studied."
Leptin was recently discovered in 1994 by Jeffrey M. Friedman and colleagues at Rockefeller University. Its discovery is important in the study of obesity which has become a problem in western society. The importance of leptin was discovered through experiments done on mice in a laboratory. Scientists found that mice who had more leptin in their bodies were thinner and didn't need to eat as much. Leptin levels can be increased by reducing stress and having quality or restful sleep.

"Later, King Louis XIV made Molière responsible for the entertainment at the court of Versailles near Paris. Molière was happy to have the king among his friends, because he had many enemies, especially important people in the Roman Catholic church. Molière's comedies deal with human weaknesses: jealousy, meanness, hypocrisy, fear of death. By putting his characters in ridiculous situations, Molière wants to entertain and educate his audience."
"One of his most important plays is ""Tartuffe"", showing a bigoted man stealing his way into a rich family. Molière's last play was ""Le Malade Imaginaire"", called in English ""The Hypochondriac"".

Its main goal was to protect the nearby shipping lanes from German mine-laying vehicles. It held 150–300 Royal Navy personnel throughout World War II. The last time it was used by the Royal Navy was in 1956."
Occupation and creation.
Roughs Tower was used in February and August 1965 by Jack Moore and his daughter Jane. They used it as a base for Wonderful Radio London.
"Major Paddy Roy Bates took the fort on 2 September 1967 to use it for his own pirate radio station (Radio Essex). However, he never starting broadcasting. Instead, he declared the independence Roughs Tower as the Principality of Sealand."
"In 1968, British workmen entered the claimed territorial waters of the Principality of Sealand to fix a buoy near the platform. Michael Bates (son of Patty Roy Bates) tried to scare the workmen off by firing warning shots from the platform. As Bates was a British subject at the time, he was called to court on firearm charges after the incident. However, the court said that the platform was outside of British waters and the case could not continue."
"In 1975, Bates introduced a constitution for Sealand, followed by a national flag, a national anthem, a currency and passports."
1978 attack.
"In August 1978, Alexander Achenbach, who said he was the prime minister of Sealand, hired many Dutch and German mercenaries to attack Sealand while Bates and his wife were in Austria. They took the platform and took Bates' son Michael hostage. Michael was able to escape and take back Roughs Tower using weapons stored on the platform. Achenbach was charged with treason. He was held there unless he paid DM 75,000 (more than US$35,000 or £23,000). Germany sent a diplomat from its London embassy to Sealand to negotiate for Achenbach's release. He was released after many weeks of negotiation. Roy Bates claimed that the diplomat's visit meant that Germany had ""de facto"" recognized Sealand."
2006 fire.
"On the afternoon of 23 June 2006, the top platform of Roughs Tower caught fire because of an electrical fault. A Royal Air Force helicopter took one person to Ipswich Hospital. The Harwich lifeboat stayed nearby Roughs Tower until a local fire tug extinguished the fire. All damage was repaired by November 2006."
Attempted sale.
"In January 2007, The Pirate Bay, an online media index founded by the Swedish think tank Piratbyrån, tried to buy Sealand after harsher copyright laws forced them to look for a new headquarters. Between 2007 and 2010, Sealand was offered for sale through the Spanish estate company ImmoNaranja at a price of €750 million (£600 million, US$906 million)."
Death of founder.
"Roy Bates died at the age of 91 on 9 October 2012. He had been suffering from Alzheimer's disease for many years. He was succeeded by his son Michael. Michael Bates lives in Suffolk, where he and his sons run a family fishing business called Fruits of the Sea. Joan Bates, Roy Bates's wife, died in an Essex nursing home at the age of 86 on 10 March 2016."
Legal status.
"In 1987, the UK increased its territorial waters from . Sealand is now in British territorial waters."
Administration.
"Sealand is ruled by the Bates family as its royal family. Roy Bates called himself ""Prince Roy"" and his wife ""Princess Joan""."
Discography.
The Marvelettes released 12 albums:
"John Ramsay, 1st Lord Bothwell"
"John Ramsay, 1st Lord Bothwell (born about 1464, died 1513) was a Scottish lord. In Parliament on 24 February 1484, James III of Scotland gave him the barony (title) of Bothwell. He forfeited the title on 8 October 1488 and became Sir John Ramsay of Trarinzeane."
Dieppe Raid
"The Dieppe Raid is also known as the Battle of Dieppe, Operation ""Rutter"" and, later, Operation Jubilee. It was a Second World War Allied attack on the German-occupied port of Dieppe. The attack took place on the northern coast of France on 19 August 1942."
"The attack began at 5:00 a.m. and by 10:50 a.m. the Allied commanders had to call a retreat. Over 6,000 infantrymen, mostly Canadian, were supported by a Canadian Armoured regiment. They were also helped by a strong force of Royal Navy and smaller Royal Air Force group."
"The goal was to capture a major port for a short period and to gather information. Upon retreat, the Allies also wanted to destroy coastal defences, port structures and important buildings. The raid was also intended to improve morale and demonstrate the commitment of the United Kingdom to attack a Western front in Europe."
"None of these goals were achieved. There was not enough Allied artillery support. The troops were trapped on the beach by obstacles and German gunfire. After less than 10 hours since the first landings, the last Allied troops had all been either killed, evacuated, or captured by the Germans."
"Instead of showing the British commitment, the terrible number of Allied deaths showed that the Allies were not ready to invade France for a long time. The attack did help the Allies to gather some information."
"A total of 3,623 of the 6,086 men (almost 60%) who went ashore were either killed, wounded, or captured. The Royal Air Force did not get the ""Luftwaffe"" to start a battle. The RAF lost 96 aircraft (at least 32 to being shot down or accidents), compared to 48 lost by the ""Luftwaffe""."
"The Royal Navy lost 33 landing craft and one destroyer. The events at Dieppe affected the plans for the North African (Operation ""Torch"") and Normandy landings (Operation ""Overlord"")."
Background.
The British decided the Dieppe attack could be planned within a month. They were very careful to keep the attack secret. No records were kept of the plans.
"After the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Forces from Dunkirk in May 1940, the British started to plan an attack force. It would use new ways of doing sea landings on beaches (amphibious warfare)."
The British started planning was to see if they could capture a port. This would allow them to test out how to use ships in the attack. It would also allow them to test new equipment.
"Dieppe, a coastal town in France, is built along a long cliff by the English Channel. In 1942, the Germans set up two large artillery batteries at Berneval-le-Grand and Varengeville. One important consideration for the British planners was that Dieppe was within range of the Royal Air Force's fighter aircraft."
"There was also pressure from the Soviet government to attack the Germans in Western Europe. By early 1942, The Wehrmacht's Operation ""Barbarossa"" attacks did not destroy the Soviet Union."
"However, the Germans moved into southern Soviet territory, pushing toward Stalingrad. Joseph Stalin demanded that the Allies attack in France to force the Germans to move 40 divisions away from the Eastern Front. This would make the fighting less hard for the Red Army."
Plan.
The Dieppe raid was a major attack planned by Vice-Admiral Lord Mountbatten.
"The attacking force would consist of 5,000 Canadians, 1,000 British troops, and 50 United States Rangers."
"It was originally planned in April 1942 and code named Operation ""Rutter"". The Allies planned to do a major attack on a German-held port on the French coast and to hold it for two tides. They would destroy enemy buildings and defences before withdrawing."
This plan was approved in May 1942. It included British parachute units attacking German artillery batteries. The Canadians would land on the beaches and attack. The parachute operation was cancelled and instead No. 3 Commando and No. 4 Commando would land by sea and attack the artillery batteries.
Land component.
"The Canadian government wanted that Canadian troops to do some fighting. The 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, commanded by Major General John Hamilton Roberts, was selected for the main force."
"The plan called for an attack, without any heavy air bombing."
The lack of enough bombing was one of the main reasons for the attack's failure. Some people think that air and naval bombing was not done to limit casualties of French civilians in the port.
"The Dieppe landings were planned on six beaches. Four were in front of the town, and two to the eastern and western sides."
"Armoured support was provided by the 14th Army Tank Regiment (The Calgary Regiment (Tank)). 58 of the new Churchill tanks would be sent ashore using the new landing craft tank (LCT). In addition, three of the Churchills had flame-throwers and all could operate in the shallow water near the beach."
"Colonel Ilan Ramon (, born Ilan Wolferman; June 20, 1954 - February 1, 2003) was an Israeli air force pilot and the only Israeli astronaut. He was a member of the STS-107 mission crew and he died during Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003."
His mother was a Holocaust survivor (at Auschwitz concentration camp) and his father fought for Israeli independence. Ramon was married to activist Rona Ramon.
Daniel Johnston
"Daniel Johnston (January 22, 1961 – September 11, 2019) was an American songwriter, singer, and artist who lived in Texas. Johnston has bipolar disorder. The movie ""The Devil and Daniel Johnston"" is about his life and music career."
"Born in Sacramento, California, Johnston grew up in West Virginia in a Christian family. He became a Beatles fan when he was young, then went off to college but did not finish. He moved to Texas to live with his brother, and ended up joining a circus. He left the circus after another worker beat him up for taking too long in a restroom, and found a church in Austin, Texas that helped him find somewhere to live. Johnston's religious beliefs are mentioned in many of his songs, especially on his CD ""1990""."
"Johnston's music career started in Austin in the 1980s. He made cassette tapes of songs he performed on a chord organ and gave many of them out for free to people he met. He started playing concerts and became very popular with music fans in Texas. Johnston appeared on MTV, and became even more popular when Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain wore a T-shirt with the cover art of one of Johnston's CDs."
"Johnston released one CD on Atlantic Records, a major record label (a big company that helps make CDs and sells them around the world) called ""Fun"" in 1994. However, he was not able to make any more CDs with Atlantic Records because not enough people bought ""Fun"". However, Johnston still writes songs, and his drawings appear on the covers of his CDs. His latest CD is ""Is and Always Was"", which came out in 2009."
"In 2010, movie director David Miller announced that he was writing the script for a new movie about Johnston that would be very different from ""The Devil and Daniel Johnston""."
"Johnston died of a suspected heart attack at his home in Waller, Texas on September 11, 2019. He was 58."

Treepie
"The treepies are a type of bird. They are a member of the crow family (""Corvidae""). There are four different genus of treepie. They are ""Dendrocitta"", ""Crypsirina"", ""Temnurus"" and ""Platysmurus"". There are 11 species of treepie."
"Treepies are similar to magpies. They have long tails. Most treepies are black, white, gray or brown. They are found in Southeast Asia. They live in tropical forests. They spend a lot of time in the tops of trees. They do not come to feed on the ground very often."
Velcro
"Velcro is a brandname and trademark owned by the Velcro Companies for ""hook-and-loop fasteners"". Hook-and-loop fasteners have a ""hook"" side, which is a piece of fabric covered with tiny hooks, and a ""loop"" side, which is covered with even smaller and ""hairier"" loops. When the two sides are pressed together, the hooks catch in the loops and hold the pieces together. When they are separated, they make a special ""ripping"" sound."
Creation.
"The person who invented hook-and-loop was a scientist named George de Mestral. During a hunting vacation in Switzerland, de Mestral came home one evening and tried to remove the burrs stuck to his dog's fur. He was very surprised to see how hard the burrs were to remove. That night he studied the burrs under a microscope and noticed that each burr was covered with hundreds of small hooks acting like grasping hands. De Mestral decided that this burr could be made to close fabric instead of buttons and zippers. By copying the hook pattern hat he saw on burrs, he made hook-and-loop!"
Vocabulary.
"George de Mestral created the Velcro trademark by combining the French words for velvet (""velour"") and hook (""crochet"")."
Mamane
"Māmane (Hawaiian language) is a shrub of Hawai'i in the ""Sophora"" genus. It is suitable for gardens."
"It is highly polymorphic, growing as a shrub or tree, and able to reach a height of in tree form. It is grow fast in every island of Hawaiian archipelago, so botanists describe many local forms including ""S.unifoliolata"""
"Hawaiian honeycreeper visits mamane sucking nectar,"
"If mamane were to disappear from Hawai'i it would take with it the palila bird, which is also endangered due to the lack of enough māmane trees. ""Loxoides bauilleui"", palila, feeds on unripe seeds of the māmane"
Mortality rate
Mortality rate is a measurement. It measures the number of deaths in a population.
This frog moves around at night but it does sometimes move during the day. It can climb trees but it spends most of its time on the ground.
The female frog lays 5 to 60 eggs at a time in bodies of water at least 4 inches deep. The eggs sometimes stick to twigs or other things underwater. The tadpoles are about 45 mm long. They are black or yellow-brown in color with a white or near-white belly.
Edible frog
"The edible frog (""Pelophylax"" kl. ""esculentus"") is a species of frogs. It lives in Europe. It is also known as water frog or green frog. However, green frog is usually given to the North American frog ""Lithobates clamitans"". The Edible frog is used as a food source to people in France."
Texas toad
"The Texas toad (""Bufo speciosus"") is a species of toads. They are very small only reaching three inches. They live in the United States in the state of Texas. But they are also found in Oklahoma, New Mexico and Mexico."
"French Cathedral, Berlin"
"(German for: French Cathedral) is the colloquial naming for the ""French Church of Friedrichstadt"" (, ) in Berlin on the Gendarmenmarkt across from the Deutscher Dom (""German Cathedral""), formerly a church of German-speaking congregants."
"The first parts of the actual ""French Church"" were built from 1701 to 1705 for the Huguenot (Calvinist) community. At that time, Huguenots made up about 25% of Berlin's population. The ""French Church"" was modelled after the destroyed Huguenot temple in Charenton-Saint-Maurice, France."
"In 1785 Carl von Gontard modified the church and built - wall to wall next to it - the domed tower, which - together with the French-speaking congregants - earned the church its naming. The domed tower is technically no part of the church, there is no access between church and tower, because both buildings have different owners. The tower, similar to that of Deutscher Dom, was simply built to give the Gendarmenmarkt a symmetric design."
The church is not a cathedral in the strict sense of the word because it has never been the seat of a bishop.
"The domed tower, which is a viewing platform open to visitors, provides a panoramic view of Berlin. A restaurant is located in the basement underneath the prayer hall. The tower also contains the Huguenot museum of Berlin."
Cane toad
"The cane toad (""Bufo marinus"") is a species of toad. They are also known as the giant neotropical toad and the marine toad."
"Cane toads are terrestrial amphibians. This means that they only go back to the water to lay their eggs. They live in Central America and South America. However, they have been introduced to Oceania and the Caribbean."
In Australia.
"Nearly 80 years ago, a group of 102 cane toads were sent to Queensland to catch sugar beetles."
"Cane-growers were concerned about the damage insect larvae were doing to crops. The insects were native to Australia, but bad for the valuable cane crops."
"The first cane toads were brought into Queensland by Reginald Mungomery, an entomologist. Before 1935, Australia had no toads. The entire continent, full of various frog species, had no toads. Tough and always moving into new areas, the cane toads started reproducing and expanding outwards every wet season. This ""invasion front"" moved around 10 km a year until the 1960s, when it began speeding up significantly."
"Cane toads are rapidly adapting to dry climates, a huge change from their origins in the South American rainforest. They have poison gland in their skin."
Their predators.
"In their native habitat, a number of fish and reptiles prey on the tadpoles and the adult toad."
"These include the broad-snouted caiman (""Caiman latirostris""), the banded cat-eyed snake (""Leptodeira annulata""), eels (family Anguillidae), various species of killifish, the black rat (""Rattus rattus"") and the Asian water monitor (""Varanus salvator"")."
"They have far fewer predators in Australia but, as time passes, some of the local animals will adapt their behaviour. Already some Australian crows have learned strategies allowing them to feed on cane toads, such as using their beak to flip toads onto their back. Opossums of the ""Didelphis"" genus likely can eat cane toads with impunity. Meat ants are unaffected by the cane toads' toxins, and therefore are able to kill them. The cane toad's normal response to attack is to stand still and let its toxin kill the attacker, which allows the ants to attack and eat the toad."
In popular culture.
"A cane toad is one of the non-human characters in Dave Barry's 1999 novel ""Big Trouble"" and in the 2002 movie based on the novel."
Parotoid gland
Famous piano trios.
"Alfred Cortot, Jacques Thibaud and Pablo Casals were world famous musicians who played and recorded piano trios in the early 20th century."
"During the second half of the 20th century the Beaux Arts Trio were the best known group. Today there are many young musicians who play piano trios, including three Japanese sisters called the Fujita Piano Trio who play a lot of their music all from memory."
Franz Grillparzer
"Franz Grillparzer (born Vienna, 15 January 1791 – died Vienna, 21 January 1872) was an Austrian dramatist and poet. His dramas include three plays (a “trilogy”) called ""Das Goldene Vliess"" (""The Golden Fleece"")."
Works.
"Two other famous plays are ""Des Meeres und der Liebe Wellen"" (""The Waves of the Sea and of Love"") and ""Der Traum, ein Leben"" (""The Dream, a Life""). Although he said he was not interested in prose his short story ""Der arme Spielmann"" (""The poor minstrel"") is probably the best known of his works and one of the best short stories of the 19th century. Grillparzer wrote the funeral speech for Beethoven's funeral in 1827."
Legacy
An Austrian pastry is named after him: the Grillparzertorte.
Pastry
"Pastry is the dough from which some baked products are made. Pastry dough is rolled out thinly and used as a base for baked products. It is made from ingredients such as flour, sugar, milk, butter, shortening, baking powder, and/or eggs. Common pastry dishes include pies, tarts, quiches and pasties."
"Pastry is also the name given to various kinds of baked products. Small cakes, tarts and other sweet or savoury baked products are called ""pastries."""
Greek food such as Spanakopita are made from pastries.
Johann Georg Albrechtsberger
"Johann Georg Albrechtsberger (born 3 February 1736 in Klosterneuburg near Vienna; died 7 March 1809 in Vienna) was an Austrian composer, organist, music theorist and music teacher. He is most known today because he was Beethoven’s teacher for a time."
Life.
"From the age of seven, Albrechtsberger was a choirboy. He had lessons in organ and music theory. As an adult, he had several jobs in churches in small towns. He became Kapellmeister at St Stephen’s Church, Vienna in 1793. This was the best job for a church musician in the empire."
Writing music.
"Albrechtsberger wrote hundreds of compositions. He wrote most of them before he got the job in Vienna. He wrote in a classical style. Albrechsberger enjoyed doing things with music which were not normally done. He would ask string players to tune their strings in different ways (called “scordatura”). He would also write slow movements with muted strings. As well as classical sonatas he wrote lots of fugues. Several people, including Mozart, thought of him as the greatest organist in the world."
Teaching.
Albrechtsberger was a very important music teacher. Joseph Haydn thought he was the best teacher in Vienna. He was very interested in contrapuntal music of the Baroque period. He copied many fugues by Bach and other composers.
"When Beethoven was a young man, he had some composition lessons from Joseph Haydn. When Haydn was going to travel to England for several months, he asked Albrechtsberger to teach Beethoven while he was gone. These lessons took place from 1793 to 1795. A few years later, Albrechtsberger said about Beethoven that “he learned absolutely nothing and will never accomplish anything decent”. Beethoven said that Albrechtsberger was a “musical pedant”. However, Beethoven still studied Albrechtsberger’s books on music theory. The string quartets which Beethoven wrote near the end of his life show the influence of Albrechtsberger."
Fidelio
"Fidelio is an opera in two acts by Ludwig van Beethoven. It is Beethoven's only opera. The German libretto is by Joseph Sonnleithner based on a French story. The opera tells how Leonore, disguised as a prison guard called ""Fidelio"", rescues her husband Florestan from death in a political prison."
"""Fidelio"" is an example of a “rescue opera”, a type of opera which was popular at the time. The hero (or heroine) has to fight against cruel people in order to rescue a lover. It was written at the time of the French Revolution. At this time, ideas about freedom and peace were being talked about by everyone, and this led to wars all over Europe. The famous Prisoners’ Chorus is a song for freedom, just like the last movement of his Ninth Symphony."
"Beethoven spent some time working on the opera before he was completely happy with it. The first time it was performed (in 1805) it was a three-act opera called ""Leonore"". There were a lot of French military officers in the audience and they thought they were being criticised. In 1806 it was performed again with two acts and a new overture (now known as ""Overture: Leonore No. 3""). But arguments between Beethoven and the theatre management meant there were no more performances. Eight years later Beethoven revised his opera again. This time it was called ""Fidelio"", and it was a great success. It has remained a famous opera ever since."
Plot.
"The setting is a Spanish state prison, a few miles from Seville, in the late 18th century."

Calendar date
"A Calendar date is a way to refer to a certain day in a calendar. With the calendar date and the calendar, the exact day can be identified. With a different calendar, the same calendar date may refer to a different day. This can be seen easiest when comparing the Julian calendar with the Gregorian calendar."
"Calendar dates are important to refer to events (most holidays are fixed with reference to a particular event or calendar date.) One example may be Easter. In the Middle Ages, it has been fixed that Easter is to be the first Sunday that is (on or after) the 14th day after the spring equinox."
"Most calendar systems have a date format that has three parts, the day of a certain month, the month and the year. Sometimes the week is added."
Persian calendar
"The Iranian calendar also known as Persian calendar or the Jalāli Calendar is a solar calendar. It is currently used in Iran and Afghanistan. It is observation-based, rather than rule-based. Each year starts on the vernal equinox as precisely determined by astronomical observations from Tehran (or the 52.5°E meridian, which also defines IRST) and Kabul. This makes it more accurate than the Gregorian Calendar."
"The current Iranian Calendar year is 1401 AP"" (AP = Anno Persico/Anno Persarum = Persian year)""."
Hexagon
"A hexagon is a polygon with 6 sides and 6 corners (vertices). Like regular triangles and squares, hexagons fit together without gaps, which are known as tessellations. Because of this, they are often used for tiling floors. They are also quite common in nature. For example, the honeycombs in a beehive are hexagons."
West Edmonton Mall
"The West Edmonton Mall (WEM) is the second-largest shopping centre in North America. It is in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. It is one of the main tourist attractions in Alberta. The mall is also the fourth largest in the world. WEM first opened on September 15, 1981."
Attractions.
"In addition to the over 500 shops in the West Edmonton Mall, there are many other things which people go to the mall for."
"The mall also has an Ice skating rink, miniature golf course, casino, skate park, hotel, petting zoo, three movie theaters and many other things to see."
Ahmad Khatami
Ayatollah Sayyid Ahmad Khatami () is a member of the Iranian Assembly of Experts.
"Although his name resembles that of Mohammad Khatami, the reformist former president of Iran, the two men are not related. In fact, they have opposite points of view on many issues, such as democracy and velayate faqih in Iran."
Tendon
"A tendon (or sinew) is a tough band of tissue that connects muscle to bone. It is built to withstand tension. Tendons are similar to ligaments except that ligaments join one bone to another. Tendons and muscles work together, roughly as follows. When muscles contract, the tendon transmits the pull to the bone."
Anatomy.
"A tendon connects to a muscle at one end, and to bone at the other end. Each tendon has these two ""insertions""."
"Collagen fibres connect the muscle to the bones. A tendon inserts into bone at one end, and into the muscle at the other end."
"Tendons do not create any pulling force of their own. The tendons transfer the force of muscles pulling on the bone. Unlike elastin (another bodily tissue) tendons have very little ""give""."
"It has ed spikes of reddish-green flowers, which bloom in summer, becoming purplish. The stamens and pistils are on different plants (dioecious); the ripe seeds are brown and shining."
Uses.
"Common sorrel has been cultivated for centuries. The leaves may be puréed in soups and sauces or added to salads and shav; they have a flavour that is similar to kiwifruit or sour wild strawberries. The plant's sharp taste is due to oxalic acid, which is a poison. In small quantities sorrel is harmless; in large quantities it can be fatal."
"Rock Springs, Wyoming"
"Rock Springs is an American city in the state of Wyoming. It is in Sweetwater County. The city has about 18,708 people. The current mayor of Rock Springs is Carl Demshar. On September 2, 1885, a riot between the Chinese immigrant miners and white immigrant miners killed at least 26 people and it was caused because of racial tensions and labor dispute."
"Buffalo, Wyoming"
"Buffalo is an American city in the state of Wyoming. It is in Johnson County. The city has about 3,900 people. The town is known for methane production from the coal bed methane extraction method that is used in the Powder River Basin."
"Sendai, Miyagi"
"is the capital city of Miyagi Prefecture, Japan. It is the largest city in the Tōhoku Region. Sendai is also called the . About 1,045,986 people live in the city as of 2010."
Date Masamune built the castle at Sendai in 1601. The modern-day city of Sendai developed around it.
"On March 11, 2011, an earthquake and a tsunami badly damaged the city and its surroundings."
"is in nearby Natori, Miyagi, south southeast of Sendai Station. The airport was badly damaged by the tsunami, but re-opened for limited service the next month. The US State Department said the airport was safe to visit."
There are several ski resorts and golf clubs in Sendai. The football club Vegalta Sendai has its stadium in the city. Sendai has one university: Tohoku University.
Electron transport chain
"An electron transport chain (ETC) is how a cell gets energy from sunlight in photosynthesis. Electron transport chains also occur in reduction/oxidation (""redox"") reactions, such as the oxidation of sugars in cellular respiration."
"In aerobic respiration, each molecule of glucose leads to about 34 molecules of ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) being produced by the electron transport chain. This is by far the most productive part of respiration."
Background.
The electron transport chain consists of a series of redox reactions in which electrons are transferred from a donor molecule to an acceptor molecule. The underlying force driving these reactions is the free energy (energy available to do work) of the reactants and products. Any reaction that decreases the overall free energy of a system will happen.
ATP synthase is an enzyme found among all domains of life. It is powered by a transmembrane proton electrochemical gradient. This is the result of the series of redox reactions. What the electron transport chain does is produce this gradient. The free energy is used to drive ATP synthesis.
David Carradine
"David Carradine (December 8, 1936 Hollywood, California, U.S. – June 3, 2009, Bangkok, Thailand), was an American actor. He was famous as the lead in a 1970s tv series ""Kung Fu""."
"Carradine had an unstable childhood. This instability continued throughout his life. He married five times. He was frequently arrested and prosecuted for a variety of offenses which often involved substance abuse. He died on June 3, 2009, from erotic asphyxiation."
Television.
"Carradine began his career participating in small roles in 1960s television show as Armstrong Circle Theatre, Wagon Train, The Virginian, Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre."
"His first starring role was in the TV western ""Shane"" (1965), where he played a lone cowboy going from town to town helping people who have problems with gunmen and bandits."
"He leapt to fame in 1972 playing the role of Kwai Chang Caine, in the TV series ""Kung Fu"". Kwai Chang Caine is a Shaolin monk fugitive who fled to America to escape the Emperor who put a price on his head, for the crime of his father."
"63 episodes were filmed between (1972 - 1975). He returned to play the character in ""Kung Fu: The Movie"" (1986), and ""Kung Fu: The Legend Continues"" (1992 - 1997) (TV series)."

Otherkin
"Otherkin are people who believe that part of them is not human inside. They say that, inside themselves, they feel more like another animal than a human. That other animal can be, for example, a wolf, a dragon or an alien. Some otherkin say that they are vampires and are usually acting like them, for example by drinking blood."
"Otherkin may also say they feel a special connection to other natural elements, for example minerals, the likes of fire, water, and wind, or plants."
"Otherkin is a neologism—a new word—and it is usually used only by people who say they ""are"" otherkin. The definition can change depending on who uses the word. Some otherkin say that their souls or minds are not human, that they were another species in a past life, or that being not-human is part of their religion. (Otherkin practice many different religions, however.) A few of them say that their physical bodies are not human, either, but there is no proof either for or against that."
Pedro Romeiras
"Pedro Romeiras was a Portuguese principal ballet dancer born 3 July 1961, in Lisbon. He was the gold medal winner of the II Prix Français de la Danse 1982."
Bonfire
"A bonfire or balefire is a large controlled outdoor fire made from bales of straw or wood. The word is believed to come from ""bone fire"". In the time of the Celts, there were midsummer festivals where animal bones were burnt to ward off evil spirits."
What it means in Great Britain.
"In Great Britain, bonfires are particularly associated with ""Guy Fawkes Night"". This night is also known as ""fireworks night"" or ""bonfire night"". On this night, people celebrate that the Gunpowder Plot was discovered. This discovery took place on 5 November 1605. They do this celebration each year. (It is called an ""annual celebration"".)"
"In Northern Ireland, ""bonfires"" are associated with celebrations on the anniversary of the Battle of the Boyne."
What it means in Japan.
"In Japan, large fires called bon-bi are set to welcome the return of the spirits of the ancestors. Though the two terms are not etymologically or historically related, they serve similar purposes and indicate the universal importance of large fires."
Use of bonfires for rituals.
"Bonfires were also used for rituals. The idea was that the fire would purify. It was used to consecrate things, or people, that is to make them sacred, in some way. In ancient times, cattle were important symbols of wealth and status. Such cattle were led through the smoke of a bonfire. Couples who were to be wed on May Day would leap through the flames of the bonfire to seal their vows. Coals from a bonfire would be taken home to light the fires in family hearths. This practice was thought to bring good fortune. People also believed that the residents of the Faery realm were incapable of producing fire themselves; embers of bonfires would be carried to the underworld and tended there."
Neopagan and Wiccan beliefs.
"Along with the Maypole, the bonfire is an important component of the Wiccan and Neopagan celebration of Beltaine, also known as May Day."
"Nine woods are placed into a traditional Wiccan balefire. These woods are rowan, dogwood, elder, poplar, oak, juniper, holly, cedar, and apple. Occasionally, pine is also used instead of holly or elder, as are a handful of other woods. In some regions, superstition, religious belief, or tradition prohibits the cutting of certain trees."

"The United States was very surprised when the Soviet Union sent Sputnik 1 into space. It did not want to fall behind. So, it began spending more money on science and education. This was when the Space Race between the Soviet Union and the United States began."
Etymology.
"The Little Foxes is a 1941 American drama movie directed by William Wyler and was based on the 1939 play of the same name by Lillian Hellman. It stars Bette Davis, Herbert Marshall, Teresa Wright, Richard Carlson, Dan Duryea, Patricia Collinge, Charles Dingle, Jessica Grayson, Russell Hicks and was distributed by RKO Radio Pictures. It was nominated for 9 Academy Awards in 1942."
Panam Ningthou
"Panam Ningthou () is a God in Meitei mythology and religion. He is the protector of crops, especially paddy from hailstorm and thunder. According to legends, He ignited fire for the first time by rubbing flints. He is one of the Umang Lai deities."
History.
"God Panam Ningthou has his major cult center in Andro village. The Andro village in Imphal East district of present day Manipur is an ancient village. People of this village worship fire that is kept burning from the time of Poireiton Khunthokpa (34 BC-18 BC). The fire is kept in the Chakpa Panam Ningthou Meihoupirol (lit. ""Panam Ningthou sacred burning fireplace"")."
"According to R. Constantine, the fire burning in Andro is the oldest man-made fire in India. It has been burning without break for centuries."
Description.
"According to Thomas Callan Hodson (T.C. Hodson), Panam Ningthou is a rain and weather God of the Meitei people of Manipur. He recorded his description in his monograph The Meitheis published in 1908."
Mythology.
"When it was one or two days before the Lai Haraoba festival of God Lainingthou Panam Ningthou begins, the God came to his temple in the form of a ball of light. He came flying from the east. He landed at a part of the Nongmaiching Hill. Sometimes, some people of Andro claimed to see that ball of light, even at other times of the year."
"God Lainingthou Panam Ningthou has a wife named Leimaren Sanarik Chaning Khombi. Some people believed that she might be of Burmese origin. So, the God went to Burma () to meet her from time to time."
Festival and worship.
God Panam Ningthou is mainly worshipped by the people of Loi caste of Meitei ethnicity in Manipur. He has his major cult center in Andro village of Imphal East district of Manipur.
"Shakespeare noted that the Loi people regarded God Panam Ningthou as a special deity of the Meitei king. He further noted that the King himself provided sacrificial animals to the God. Buffalo was one among the sacrificial animals used to be sacrificed during the Lai Haraoba festival. Pigs were sacrificed when there was no Lai Haraoba festival. Whenever there was any suspicion of danger to the Meitei king, the King would send a pig and a cock to be sacrificed to God Panam Ningthou of Andro."
"The Chakpa Haraoba (one of the 4 types of Lai Haraoba festival) is annually celebrated in honor of God Panam Ningthou. The festive occasion falls in the Meitei lunar month of Lamta (""March-April interface month""). The festival starts from the first Sunday of the ""Lamta"" month."
"During the 9 day long festival, no outsiders of Andro are allowed to stay at the village. In modern times, notice is issued one month before the festival begins through mass media like television, newspaper and radio. The notice informs outsiders to leave the place as it is about to begin the festival. Natives of Andro may come to Andro before the festival starts. Once the festival begins, no one is allowed to either leave from or come to the village. People who have converted into another religion are not allowed to participate in the religious festival even if they are native of Andro. There are some Christian converts and Hindu converts in Andro."
"During the festival, people of ""Andro village"" wear black clothes as a custom. Besides Panam Ningthou, there are twelve other deities worshipped in Andro. During the Lai Haraoba festivals of these deities, outsiders of Andro can witness the event. The festivals in their honor are done separately from that of Panam Ningthou. But the festival of Pureiromba can be done together with that of Panam Ningthou. At this too, outsiders can witness the event but the place of worship is different from the exclusive one of Panam Ningthou."
"During the Haraoba of Panam Ningthou, there is no shortage of meat and wine. Boys and girls play important role in the festival."
Temple.
"The Temple of Panam Ningthou is in Andro, Manipur. It is also the Loishang (English: Office) to the representatives of the ""pana""s (English: State Divisions). Sacred items are kept inside the temple. One house each for two ""Pana""s was constructed near the Loishang. Two dormitories for boys and girls are also built."
The sanctum of God Lainingthou Panam Ningthou and Goddess Leimaren Sanarik Chaning Khombi are located in the right side corner and the left side corner respectively as one enters the room.
Association with other gods.
"According to the Thalon text, Panam Ningthou was one of the 5 gods of 5 different places of the Selloi Langmai Hill. The cults of these five gods were integrated into that of a single God with the name ""Langmai Ningthou"" (lit. ""King of the Langmais""). The personal names became the aliases or various forms of the God. With this, the tribal society of the Selloi Langmai people evolved into a chiefdom. This chiefdom later rose to the Angom clan."
Namesake.
Panam Ningthou Semba.
"There is a real servant class named ""Panam Ningthou Semba"". It takes care of the articles (things) related to polo () for the Meitei royalty. There are seven grades of officers in this group. The grades are (1) Sellungba Ahal, (2) Sellungba Naha, (3) Pakhan-lakpa, (4) Naharakpa, (5) Yaphi Ahal, (6) Yaphi Naha and (7) Sennakhal."

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a science fiction comedy series by Douglas Adams. It started out as a radio show series for the BBC Radio 4 in 1978.
"Between 1979 - 1992, Adams wrote a series of five books."
"In 1980, a second radio series was broadcast."
"In 1981, it was made into a television series."
"In 2004, the third radio series was broadcast."
"In 2005, it was made into a movie, and the fourth and fifth radio series were broadcast. A CD was released following the final episode transmission of each radio series."
"It has also been a computer game, and several stage plays and comic books. Douglas Adams also suggested he would write a sixth book but he died before he could complete it, so Eoin Colfer wrote the sixth book in the series."
"In 2018, the sixth radio series, the ""Hexagonal Phase"", was broadcast on BBC Radio 4."
"It featured Professor Stephen Hawking introducing himself as the voice of ""The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy Mk II"" by saying: ""I have been quite popular in my time. Some even read my books""."
Books.
"The six books in the ""Hitchhiker's Guide"" series are:"
Synopsis.
"The radio, book, TV and movie versions differ from each other. The same basic plot is used but they sometimes contradict each other. This is due to Adams rewriting the story for each new medium."
"In all versions, the story follows the adventures of Arthur Dent. He is an Englishman. His house is being bulldozed to make way for a bypass. At the same time the Earth is being demolished by the Vogons to make way for an intergalactic bypass. The vogons are a race of unpleasant and bureaucratic aliens."
"Dent's friend, Ford Prefect, is an alien. He is a researcher for the eponymous guidebook. He rescues Dent from Earth's destruction."
"Zaphod Beeblebrox is Ford's eccentric semi-cousin. Beeblebrox is the Galactic President. He has stolen the ""Heart of Gold"", a spacecraft equipped with the Infinite Improbability Drive. The depressed robot Marvin the Paranoid Android and Trillian are crew members."
"Trillian was known as Tricia McMillan, a woman Arthur once met at a party in Islington. Beeblebrox saved her from Earth's destruction. She is the only other human survivor."
"Arthur learns that the Earth was actually a giant supercomputer. It was created by another supercomputer, Deep Thought. Deep Thought had been built to give the answer to the ""Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything"". It gave the answer as ""42"". The creators of Deep Thought were disappointed and Deep Thought was then instructed to design the Earth supercomputer to determine what the question actually is."
"The Earth was destroyed by the Vogons just before its calculations were due to complete. Arthur becomes the target of the descendants of the Deep Thought creators, believing his mind must hold the Question. With his friends' help, Arthur escapes and they decide to have lunch at The Restaurant at the End of the Universe. They have more adventures."
Cookbook
"A cookbook, or cookery book, is kind of book that tells people how to prepare food for eating using specific instructions called a recipe. Most cookbooks also have tips on how to eat and present the food as well. They usually list the ingredients needed, time needed to cook, and the instructions. They may give other tips too."
Somalia
"Somalia (; ), officially called the Federal Republic of Somalia (; ), is a country located on the Horn of Africa. It used to be known as the Somali Republic."
"It is bordered by Djibouti to the northwest, Kenya with Yemen to the north, the Guardafui Channel and Somali Sea to the east, and Ethiopia to the west. A person from Somalia is called a ""Somali""."
Government.
Somalia is a republic governed by a federal administration with various regional administrations governing on a micro level.
"Somalia is an independent country. Since the Somali Civil War in the 1980s, there has been no working government that covers all of Somalia; instead, different pirates have been destabilizing the region to the southwest, the Gulf of Aden. Somalia is now trying to gain control of their people and get back up on its feet with very little resources."
Clan wars.
"There are four big tribes in Somalia, the Hawiye, the Dirweyn, the Koofur Orsi inhabitants and the Darood. Somalis are a nation of related families, which are called clans. Groups of clans sometimes band together based on a common ancestor or other blood relationship. Sometimes these family relationships date back hundreds or even thousands of years in the past."
"Somalis are mostly camel or goat herders, and depend on their livestock to live. In Somalia there are limited sources of drinking water and grazing land, and disputes over grazing rights, water rights, or land in general can lead to fighting between families. Because of the clan system, the families involved will call on their clan for help, leading to a clan war."
"The station was opened on 22 August 1856 as part of the Eastern Counties Railway branch to Loughton. It was changed by the successor company, the Great Eastern Railway, to include services to Ilford by way of the Fairlop Loop that was opened in 1903. After 1923 the station came under the control of the London &amp; North Eastern Railway until it was given to the London Passenger Transport Board (LT) on 14 December 1947 as part of the extension of the Central Line services of the London Underground. The station was a terminus for the Central Line, with passengers transferring to a steam shuttle towards Epping, until electric services began as far as Loughton (and around the 'loop' to Hainault) on 21 November 1948."

Abram Games
"Abram Games (29 July 191427 August 1996) was a British graphic designer. He was born Abraham Gamse. He was the son of immigrants: a Latvian photographer and a Russo-Polish (part Russian, part Polish) seamstress. He anglicized (make something sound more English) his name to Games at age 12 and was basically an autodidactic designer, and went to London's St. Martins School of Art (today named the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design) for only two terms. However, while working as a ""studio boy"" (a general assistant) in commercial design company Askew-Young in London 1932-36, he took night classes in life drawing. In 1934, his entry was second in the Health Council Competition and in 1935 he won a poster competition for the London City Council. From 1936 to 1940 he was on his own as a freelance poster artist."
Joan Waste
Joan Waste (1534 - 1 August 1556) was a blind woman who was burned in Derby because she would not stop being a Protestant. She had bought a Bible so that friends could read to her.
Biography.
"Waste was blind when she was born in 1534. Her parents were William and Joan Waste. William's job was to cut people's hair and make rope. By the age of twelve, Joan had learned to make ropes and clothes."
"In 1553, Queen Mary came to the throne and it was made illegal to hold Protestant views. Mary condemned 277 people for not having the right sort of religion. This crime was called heresy."
"Joan Waste was taken to court for breaking the law. The judge was a man employed by the bishop. She had to defend her views and was told she would die. She had not liked the fact that the church services were being read in the language of Latin. She was to die for being a Protestant and for refusing to agree with the Catholic Church. She bought a Bible in English, but the Catholic Church wanted them to only be in Latin. She asked friends to read to her for a penny."
"Her trial took place at All Saints Church. This main building has been rebuilt, but the tower was built in 1530. This tower is now part of Derby's cathedral."
On the day of her death she walked arm-in-arm with her twin brother to be burned.
Her death took place at the Windmill Pit on the Burton Road in Derby. She was hanged over the fire with a rope. She fell into the fire when the rope burned through. The judge was Antony Draycot. He went home to his meal.
The place where Joan Waste was killed is now the site of a church. When Elizabeth I of England became queen in 1559 she removed Ralph Baines from the job of Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield. Baines was sent to be a prisoner of the Bishop of London. The judge was also sent to be a prisoner. He died after being released in 1571.

"The iPod is a range of portable music players designed by the company Apple Inc. in California. The iPod comes with computer cables so that the user can put music from their computer onto the iPod, and play music from it using headphones. Newer iPods allow a user to play games, view pictures, watch videos and use the internet, too."
"The first iPod was named the iPod Classic. This iPod was released on October 23, 2001. Apple Inc. made the iPod like this until September 9, 2014."
"Apple made a smaller iPod called the iPod mini. It was much smaller than the iPod Classic, but did not hold as many songs. It used flash memory, a special kind of memory for very small electronics, instead of a hard drive. It was replaced by a version of the iPod called the iPod nano."
"Another type of iPod, called the iPod shuffle, was very small, and it used flash memory, like the iPod mini but it had no screen. It was the least expensive iPod."
"The most expensive iPod is called the iPod touch. It has a touch screen, like the iPhone. It's very similar to the IPhone, but it's not a smartphone. The first generation of iPod touch was released on September 5, 2007 and was discontinued on May 10, 2022."
"iPods often contain songs downloaded from an online music store, using a program called iTunes. (The name of Apple's music and video store is the iTunes Store.)

It is bordered by Nicaragua to the north, Panama to the southeast, the Pacific Ocean to the west, and the Caribbean Sea to the east. The official language of Costa Rica is Spanish. The official currency is the colón. It has enjoyed a long period of peace since the 1863 civil war. Because of its natural beauty and political stability, it is nicknamed the ""Switzerland of Latin America"". Costa Rica has had no army since December 1, 1948. Instead of spending money on the military, the government spends money on education and health."
"5,094,118 people live in Costa Rica. The capital city is San José. The current President is Carlos Alvarado Quesada. He was elected in 2018"
History.
Pre-Columbian period.
The indigenous people of Costa Rica belong to the Intermediate Area. This Intermediate Area is where the Mesoamerican and Andean indigenous cultures mixed together. The country was influenced by various Chibcha speaking indigenous people.
The impact of indigenous peoples' culture on modern Costa Rica has been small. The country did not have a strong native civilization to begin with. Most of the indigenous population was absorbed into the Spanish colony. There are still some small indigenous groups. The largest is the Bribri and Boruca tribes in south Costa Rica.
Spanish colonization.
Christopher Columbus sailed to the eastern shores of Costa Rica during his last trip in 1502. He reported large amounts of gold jewelry among the indigenous people.
"During the colonial period, Costa Rica was the most southern province of the Captaincy General of Guatemala. But it mostly ruled itself as a part of the Spanish Empire. Costa Rica's distance from the capital in Guatemala, its legal prohibition to trade with the Viceroyalty of New Granada, and the lack of gold and silver made Costa Rica into a poor, little populated region of the Spanish Empire. Costa Rica was called ""the poorest and most miserable Spanish colony in all America"" by a Spanish governor in 1719."
"Costa Rica's poverty was also because there were not enough indigenous people available for slavery. Most of the Costa Rican settlers had to work on their own land. There were no large ""haciendas"" (plantations). For all these reasons, Costa Rica was unappreciated and forgotten by the Spanish Crown. It had to develop on its own."
"Costa Rica became a ""rural democracy"" with no oppressed mestizo or indigenous class. It was not long before Spanish settlers turned to the hills, where they found rich volcanic soil and a better climate."
Independence.
"Costa Rica never fought for independence from Spain. On September 15, 1821, after the last Spanish defeat in the Mexican War of Independence (1810–21), the authorities in Guatemala declared the independence of all of Central America. That date is still celebrated as Independence Day in Costa Rica."
"Costa Rica joined the First Mexican Empire of Agustín de Iturbide. After its collapse in 1823, Costa Rica became a province of the new Federal Republic of Central America. it existed from 1823 to 1839. It had a very loose authority over its provinces, especially the poor and remote Costa Rica."
"In 1824, the Costa Rican capital was moved to San José. This led to a brief battle with the old capital, Cartago."
"While civil wars were common in the Federal Republic of Central America, Costa Rica was largely peaceful."
"In 1838, Costa Rica formally proclaimed itself an independent country. The local population had little allegiance to the federal government in Guatemala. From colonial times to now, Costa Rica's reluctance to become politically tied with the rest of Central America has been a major obstacle to efforts for greater regional integration."

Hugh Downs
"Hugh Malcolm Downs (February 14, 1921 – July 1, 2020) was an American radio and television broadcaster, announcer, television host, news anchor, TV producer, author, game show host, and music composer."
"For many years, he held the Guinness World Record for the most hours on commercial network television, before Regis Philbin broke his record."
"Downs was announcer/sidekick for ""Tonight Starring Jack Paar"" from 1957 to 1962, co-host of the NBC News program ""Today"" from 1962 to 1971, host of the ""Concentration"" game show from 1958 to 1969, and anchor of the ABC News magazine ""20/20"" from 1978 to 1999."
"Downs was born in Akron, Ohio on February 14, 1921. His career would start in 1945 and since then he had appeared in over 100 television programs and guest star appearances, he retired in 1999. He was married to Ruth Shaheen from 1944 until her death in 2017. They had two children together."
"Downs died on July 1, 2020, in Scottsdale, Arizona from heart failure. He was 99."
Dodder
"The Dodder, Cuscuta, is a genus of about 100–170 species of parasitic flowering plants."
"Recent genetic research has shown that it is correctly placed in the morning glory family, Convolvulaceae."
"The genus is found throughout the temperate and tropical regions of the world. Most species live in subtropical and tropical regions. The genus is rare in cool temperate climates, with only four species native to northern Europe."
Appearance.
"Dodder can be identified by its thin stems. They look leafless, with the leaves reduced to minute scales."
"From mid-summer to early autumn, the vines can produce small fruit that take the same color as the vine, and are about the size of a common pea. It has very low levels of chlorophyll; some species, such as ""Cuscuta reflexa"", can photosynthesize slightly. Others such as ""C. europaea"" are entirely dependent on the host plants for nutrition."
"Dodder flowers range in color from white to pink to yellow to cream. Some flower in the early summer, others later, depending on the species. The seeds are tiny, and produced in large amounts. They have a hard coating, and can survive in the soil for 5–10 years or more."
Life habit.
"Dodder seeds sprout at or near the surface of the soil. Germination occurs without a host, but the seedling must reach a green plant quickly. Dodder grows toward the smell of nearby plants."
"If a plant is not reached within 5 to 10 days of germination, the dodder seedling will die. Before a host plant is reached, the dodder, as other plants, relies on food reserves in the embryo; the cotyledons are very small."
Parasitism.
"After a dodder attaches itself to a plant, it wraps itself around it. If the host contains food useful to dodder, the dodder produces 'haustoria' that insert themselves into the host. The original root of the dodder in the soil then dies."
"The dodder can grow and attach itself to multiple plants. In tropical areas it can grow continuously, and may reach high into the canopy of shrubs and trees. In temperate climates it is an annual plant, restricted to low vegetation that can be reached by new seedlings each spring."
"Dodder is parasitic on a very wide variety of plants, including a number of agricultural and horticultural crop species, such as alfalfa, flax, clover, potatoes, chrysanthemum, dahlia, trumpet vine, ivy and petunias, among others."

People can break DRM. If someone breaks a DRM technology then copying is possible. All common DRM technologies have been broken. Making a DRM technology that can not be broken is very hard. Some people say that all DRM technologies can be broken. In the United States it is illegal to break a DRM.
DRM is a way for companies to keep their profits while sharing their content online. A good example of this is BBC iPlayer. They do this by keeping their content online for a certain amount of time.
Cement
"Cement is a material that hardens and sticks to other materials to hold them together. Portland cement is a common kind, and made from quicklime (heated limestone) and clay. Cement is used to make concrete and mortar."
Brown algae
"Brown algae are a large group of multicellular algae. All the brown algae are multicellular. Most brown algae have fucoxanthin, a chemical that gives them a brown color. They include many seaweeds in colder waters of the Northern Hemisphere. Most brown algae live in marine environments, where they play an important role both as food and as a potential habitat."
"There are 2000 species of brown algae. Most species live in the ocean. They are important as food and as homes for many animals and marine life. Some brown algae are gathered by humans for food. The giant kelp ""Macrocystis"" is a brown alga that forms underwater forests, and it may grow to 60 meters. The Sargasso Sea gets its name from the ""Sargassum"" seaweed that floats on the surface. Many brown algae grow on rocks at the seashore."
Brown algae are unique among heterokonts in developing into multicellular forms with differentiated tissues. But they reproduce by means of flagellated spores and gametes that look like the cells of other heterokonts. Genetic studies show their closest relatives to be the yellow-green algae (Xanthophyceae).
Classification.
This is a list of the orders in the class Phaeophyceae:
Bacillus
"Bacillus is a genus of rod shaped bacteria. They are Gram-positive, meaning they have an extra outside cell layer."
"Bacilli are partly or wholly aerobic. They do aerobic respiration. They are everywhere in nature. ""Bacillus"" includes both free-living (non-parasitic) and parasitic pathogenic species."
"Under stressful conditions, they produce endospores. These are not true spores, but like survival pods they can stay in a dormant state for long periods."
"Some species of ""Bacillus"" are worth noting:"
Milk powder
"Milk powder is a powder made by dehydrating milk. When water is added, it becomes liquid milk again. Milk powder is often used in countries that lack widespread access to refrigeration. As well, it is often used in recipes that call for milk."
Vaccinium vitis-idaea
"Vaccinium vitis-idaea (also called lingonberry, partridgeberry, mountain cranberry or cowberry) is a small evergreen shrub from the heather family that makes edible fruits."
Dehydration
"Dehydration (hypohydration) means less water in something. The word comes from the ancient Greek word for water, ""hydor""."
"People get dehydrated when they lose more water than they take in. The human body needs water to survive. If a person gets badly dehydrated, their body will be unable to work the right way. Bad dehydration can cause organ damage and even death."
What causes dehydration?
A living organism will get dehydrated if their body is losing water in some way and they do not drink enough to replace the water. The most common causes of dehydration are:
Who gets dehydration?
"Any living being can get dehydrated. Some people are more at risk of dehydration. Elderly people, very young children, and people with chronic illnesses are at the highest risk for dehydration."
Besides his operas he also wrote orchestral pieces for special occasions. He also wrote some songs for performance in the salon.
Meyerbeer was one of the richest men in Europe. This is why some people hated him.
Meyerbeer’s reputation after his death.
"Meyerbeer’s operas were very popular in the middle of the 19th century, but by the end of the century they had gone out of fashion. From 1933 to 1945 his music was banned in Germany by the Nazis because he was Jewish. Today there is some interest again, but nothing like the huge popularity he had in his lifetime."
Grand opera
"Grand Opera is a term which is used to describe an opera with continuous music. It is a kind of opera that was popular in the 19th-century. Grand operas are usually divided into four or five acts. There have large casts (many singers taking part) and large orchestras. There is a lot of scenery. The story is dramatic. It is usually a story about a hero from history. The term ""Grand Opera"" has often been used to describe the Paris Opéra from the late 1820s to around 1850, and sometimes to describe the Paris Opéra itself."
"In a broader sense ""Grand Opera"" can be any large-scale opera from European countries. During the 1830s and 1840s Giacomo Meyerbeer was thought to be the greatest composer of Grand Opera."
Lake Lucerne
"Lake Lucerne is a lake in central Switzerland. It is the fourth largest lake in the country. The German name is Vierwaldstättersee which means: ""Lake of the Four Forested Cantons""."
It is possible to travel all the way round the side of the lake by road. There are several tunnels on the way. It is very popular with tourists. There are many hotels by the lake.
Die Feen
"Die Feen (""The Fairies"") is an opera in three acts by Richard Wagner. The German libretto was written by the composer. He was adapting a story by Carlo Gozzi called ""La donna serpente""."
"""Die Feen"" was the first opera that Wagner finished. However, it was never performed during his lifetime. It has never become popular, although the overture is sometimes played. The music shows the influence of Carl Maria von Weber and other composers of the time. It also shows some musical ideas that Wagner was to develop later in his life in his famous operas. The fairy tale atmosphere in the story is also an idea that he uses in his later operas which deal with fantasy stories. The idea of being saved (redemption) is also an important idea that he used in later operas."
Rienzi
"Rienzi is an opera by Richard Wagner. Its full title is Rienzi, der Letzte der Tribunen (""Rienzi, the Last of the Tribunes""). It is one of the earliest operas Wagner wrote. There are five acts. Wagner wrote the libretto himself, using the story from a novel by Edward Bulwer-Lytton. It was composed between 1838 and 1840 It was first performed at the Hofoper, Dresden on 20 October 1842. It was the first time Wagner had a success as an opera composer."
Story.
"The story of the opera is set in Rome and is based on the life of Cola di Rienzi (1313–1354), a medieval Italian populist figure who manages to trick the nobles and their followers. He helps the people to get power. At first he is very popular, but then he has to use force against the nobles, and the Church turns against him. In the end the ordinary people burn the Capitol where Rienzi and his friends are sheltering."
Chess tournament
A chess tournament is a competition between chess players. It can take one of these forms:
"Since the first international chess tournament in London, 1851, chess tournaments have become the standard form of chess competition among serious players. Currently, FIDE holds candidates tournaments every two years to determine challenger to the world champion."
"In 1851, Adolf Anderssen became first unofficial champion. In 1858, Paul Morphy beat him and became second unofficial champion. In 1871, Johannez Zukertort defeated Adolf Anderssen to become third unofficial chess champion. There are three unofficial world chess champions: Adolf Anderssen, Paul Morphy and Johannes Zukertort, stemming from first strong international tournament in London in 1851, won by Anderssen."
The Flying Dutchman
"Der fliegende Holländer (""The Flying Dutchman"") is an opera by Richard Wagner. Wagner wrote the libretto himself. The story comes from the legend of the ""Flying Dutchman"", which is about the captain of a ship. It is his fate that he has keep sailing the sea, without ever going on to land, until Judgment Day."
"The most important idea in the story as told by Wagner is redemption through love. It was a favourite idea of Wagner, who used it a lot in his later operas."
"Wagner conducted the first performance at the Semper Oper in Dresden, in 1843. It is an early opera of Wagner, but it shows his mature style. It is very different from the previous opera ""Rienzi"" which is still quite similar to operas that other composers were writing. In ""Der fliegende Holländer"" the drama is very important. Wagner uses a number of leitmotifs: musical ideas associated with particular characters and themes in the story. The leitmotifs are all introduced in the overture. We hear the famous leitmotif of the ocean and then those of the Dutchman and of Senta, the girl he falls in love with."
"Wagner originally wrote ""Der fliegende Holländer"" to be performed without any breaks (intermission). Sometimes it is performed like that today, but Wagner also made a version with three acts."

Yi I
"Yi I (December 26, 1536–1584) was a Korean Confucian scholar. His mother was a famous calligraphist, Shin Saimdang. He was very intelligent as a child, learning to read at three and being very bright at his studies. He was also devoted to his parents: when his mother was sick, he prayed to his ancestors to heal her; and when his father was sick, he cut his own finger with a knife and let his father drink his blood (at that time, people thought human blood was very good medicine)."

X-ray
"X-radiation is a kind of electromagnetic radiation. X-rays are waves of X-radiation. X-rays have a shorter wavelength, and therefore more energy, than ultraviolet radiation. They have a much shorter wavelength than visible light (the light that we can see). Radiation with shorter wavelengths (more energy) than the X-ray is called Gamma radiation (γ-rays). These are all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum."
The wavelength of X-rays covers a wide range. Most X-rays have a wavelength in the range of 0.01 to 10 nanometres. This corresponds with frequencies in the range 30 petahertz to 30 exahertz (3×1016 Hz to 3×1019 Hz) and energies in the range 100 eV to 100 keV.
"X-rays can go through many solid materials. For this reason, taking photograms with X-rays is used in medicine in order to see bones and other things inside the body. Sometimes the term ""X-Ray"" means these pictures instead of the radiation that makes them."
"What these images show will depend on three things: Rayleigh scattering, Compton scattering and photoabsorption. The images show bone because it is dense enough that X-rays are not able to pass through it. Instead, the X-rays are either absorbed or scattered. The images do not show skin and muscle, however, because these tissues are transparent enough for the X-rays to pass through them without being absorbed too much. To detect tumors, other imaging devices are used; such as magnetic resonance imaging. A computed tomography scanner combines an X-ray machine and computer to construct a three dimensional (3D) picture. This has some ability to see other things besides bone."
"X-rays are made by hitting metal with fast-moving electrons. They are photons, tiny packets of energy that can move atoms and change chemicals in the body. They are ionizing radiation but the things they do depend on the wavelength of the X-rays (or how much energy they have). X-rays with smaller energies (""soft"" x-rays) cause the photoelectric effect. Mid-level energies cause Compton scattering. High-level energies (""hard"" X-rays) cause pair production. X-rays used for making pictures of people have low to medium energy. Radiation therapy that treats cancer uses Compton scattering and sometimes Pair production."
"There are small amounts of X-rays in the air. Like other energy in the air, X-rays can change living cells. Exposing the human body to high doses of X-rays for a long time is dangerous. It can cause cancer. However, cancer cells are hurt more easily, so X-rays are sometimes used to kill them."
Computed tomography scanner
A computed tomography (CT) scanner is an X-ray machine that takes cross section images. They can help a doctor in diagnosis.
Hanoi
"Hanoi () is the capital of Vietnam. It is also the second most populated city in the country. In 2004, about 3,083,800 people lived in the city. It has been the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam) since 1945 and the capital of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (all of Vietnam) since 1976. Before that, it was the capital of the country now called Vietnam for most of the time from at least the 11th century until 1802. The city is on the right of the Red River, and the city's name translates to English as ""inside the river"". Things made there include machine tools, plywood, textiles, chemicals and handicrafts. Hanoi is at 21°2' North, 105°51' East, 1,760 km north of Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon). Popular tourist sites in the city include Ho Chi Minh's Mausoleum, Hoa Lo Prison, and the Palace of Literature. Nearby Hanoi is also where pho, Vietnamese beef noodle soup, was first created."

Draize test
"The Draize test is a test, to see if a substance is toxic. John H. Draize and Jacob M. Spines first used the test in 1944. The test was first used for cosmetics, but later for other substances as well. To see if a substance is toxic, it is applied to the skin or the eye of an animal, for a given time. After the time, the substance is washed out and the effects are recorded. Very often, small animals, such as rabbits were used. After the test, the animals are observed for up to 14 days. If the test does irreversible damage to the skin or the eye, the animal is killed after the test. Animals may be re-used for testing purposes if the product tested causes no permanent damage. Animals are typically reused after a ""wash out"" period during which all traces of the tested product are allowed to disperse from the test site."
"The tests are controversial. They are seem as cruel and unscientific because of the differences between rabbit and human eyes, and the subjective nature of the visual evaluations. The FDA supports the test, stating that ""to date, no single test, or battery of tests, has been accepted by the scientific community as a replacement [for] ... the Draize test"". Because of its controversial nature, the use of the Draize test in the U.S. and Europe has declined in recent years and is sometimes modified so that anaesthetics are administered and lower doses of the test substances used. Chemicals already shown to have adverse effects ""in vitro"" are not currently used in a Draize test, thereby reducing the number and severity of tests that are carried out."
Other tests have been developed which can replace the Draize test for many applications: First there is a test that uses chicken eggs. Another test uses Spanish slugs.
Hen's egg test on chorioallantoic membrane
"The Hen's egg test on chorioallantoic membrane, or hen's egg test is a test that can be used to test the toxicity of substances. It is also often used to test vaccines. It is a CAM Assay. The product ot be tested is applied to a special membrane. Such tests were first used because chicken eggs were easily available. As the respective membrane does not contain any nerve cells, it is likely that the developing bird embryo does not feel pein during the test. These tests are not considered to be animal testing."
Social choice theory
"Social choice theory, which is also called theory of collective choice, is a theory that looks at how a group of people reach a decision. Usually this is done by combining and aggregating the opinion of each member of the group. A classic problem of social choice theory is that of holding an election or a popular vote."
Year of the Three Emperors
"The Year of the Three Emperors, or the Year of the Three Kaisers, () refers to the year 1888 during the German Empire in German history. The year is important because two German Emperors, or Kaisers, died. This meant that there were three emperors in a year.. The three emperors who ruled Germany during this year were Wilhelm I, Frederick III and Wilhelm II. The mnemonic “""drei Achten, drei Kaiser""” (English: ""three eights, three emperors"") is still used today in Germany to remember which year it was."
Tannhäuser
"Tannhäuser und der Sängerkrieg auf Wartburg (En: ""Tannhäuser and the Singers' Contest at Wartburg"") is a three-act opera with words and music by Richard Wagner. It was Wagner's fifth opera. He worked on it between 1842 and 1845. It was first performed at the Dresden Royal Opera on 19 October 1845 with Wagner conducting. The opera was a success. It became hugely popular in Germany."
"In 1859, ""Tannhäuser"" was the first Wagner opera to be performed in the United States of America. By 1861, the opera had been performed many times in Germany when Wagner was asked to revise the work for the Paris Opéra. Despite his best efforts, Wagner failed. He was not popular. Anti-Wagner riots broke out. He withdrew the work. It was not staged again in France until 1895. Meanwhile, the opera opened the second season of the Metropolitan Opera in New York City in November 1884."
Background.
"Wagner was in Paris completing ""The Flying Dutchman"" when he began thinking about writing another opera. A friend suggested Tannhäuser as a subject. Wagner did not like the tale. Back in Germany however, he gathered materials by Tieck, Heine, and others about Tannhäuser. Vacationing in Bohemia, he had a change of heart. He began preparing an outline for ""Tannhäuser"". Returning home to Dresden, he immersed himself in the tale. He completed the opera in October 1845. He conducted the first performance that month at the Royal Opera House."
"His Venus said, ""You are a genius, but you write such eccentric stuff that it is impossible to sing."" His Tannhäuser was completely baffled. The audience was puzzled. The reception was lukewarm. Wagner began revisions at once. The second performance played to a near empty house. In 1859, Wagner offered ""Tannhäuser"" to the Paris Opéra. They wanted it sung in French. They also wanted a ballet in the second act. This so the Jockey Club had time to finish dinner and arrive at the Opéra just in time to ogle the dancers. Wagner refused to move the ballet from the first act to the second act. There were complaints. Jockey Club members interrupted the performance whenever possible. It was a disaster."
"The opera disappeared from the French stage for 34 years. A few years after the Jockey Club incident, Wagner began revising the Paris version. He produced a sophisticated sound version that was superior to the first draft. Though there are several set pieces in the opera, the opera is closer to Wagner's vision of complete independence from such set pieces. ""Tannhäuser"" is on the threshold of the leitmotif, and the diminishing of the sound power of the orchestra in favor of the sung word."
Sources.
"Wagner's sources for the opera are spread over 600 year time span. In 1391, and again at the beginning of the 15th century, tales were in circulation about a paradise within a German mountain and a traveler who idles with a Sybil before heading to Rome for the Pope's forgiveness. The ""Song of Tannhäuser"" of 1515 combines moralizing with the adventures of an historical Minnesinger named Danhuser, Tanhuser, or Tannenhauser. This Minnesinger's songs told of erotic love and its opposite, holy love."
"Wagner was an insatiable reader, always on the alert for material that could be adapted to an opera. For ""Tannhäuser"", he combined elements not only from traditional tales but material from C. J. L. Lukas's ""Essay"" (1838) on the character of Tannhäuser and Ludwig Tieck's ""Faithful Eckart"" (1799). Ludwig Bechstein's ""Thuringian Legends"" (1835) included the story of the song contest. Wagner was familiar with the song contest through E. T. A. Hoffmann's ""Serapion Brothers"", Friedrich de la Motte-Fouque's drama ""The Singers Dispute in the Wartburg"" (1828), and Wagensil's ""Nuremberg Chronicle""."""
Story of the opera.
"The story is about the struggle between sacred love and profane love, and redemption (salvation) through love. The story is based on the historical character of Tannhäuser, about whom very little is known except the myths about him. It is also about the myth of Venus, but it also deals with the medieval Minnesinger (minstrel). Half of the opera takes place in a historical setting, and half takes place in the mythological Venusberg."
Criticism.
"The critics took Wagner to task for his historical inaccuracies. First, the real Tannhauser was only a boy at the supposed time of the song contest. Secondly, they regarded Wagner's Elisabeth with scorn: Wagner had made the character an amalgamation of several historical women."
Production.
"Cuts to the original were made almost immediately because the singers were not capable of understanding and thus acting their roles. The Prelude to Act 3 was cut from 155 bars to 92. In the original final scene, neither Elisabeth or Venus appeared on stage. The audience was puzzled."
"The original final scene was retained until the 13th performance in 1847. Wagner then recast the final pages to make Venus visible on stage. The Venusberg did not appear however. This new ending disturbed the audience because they were used to the older version. Wagner had also cut the pilgrim's chorus, further antagonizing the audience. Another version was made restoring the chorus."
Early productions.
"The first performance outside Dresden occurred at Weimar. This production demonstrated to small theaters that they could stage the opera. Other productions took place in Schwerin, Breslau, Prague, Wiesbaden, and other small houses. The opera played in New York in 1859. It played in London (in Italian) in 1876. In Vienna, Johann Strauss performed excerpts in 1853. The first Austrian staging occurred at Graz in 1854. Vienna mounted the opera in 1857. The opera was performed at the Vienna court opera in 1875. In 1860, the Paris Opera wanted the work in a revised version in French. Wagner made extensive revisions for Paris."
New York State Route 199
"New York State Route 199 (NY 199) is a road in the Hudson Valley of New York, United States. It is long, and goes from near Kingston to Millerton. In between, NY 199 crosses over the Hudson River over a bridge and passes through the communities of Red Hook and Pine Plains. Part of the road was part of the Ulster and Delaware Turnpike. NY 199 was named in 1930."
New York State Route 9G
"New York State Route 9G (NY 9G) is a road in Dutchess County, New York, United States. It starts at US 9 in Poughkeepsie and follows the Hudson River as it goes north. It crosses Route 9 just north of Rhinebeck and ends in Hudson."
Kennedy Center Honors
"Every year, the Kennedy Center gives its Kennedy Center Honors to artists. These artists have contributed to American culture. Most of these artists were performers, such as actors, dancers, and musicians. Some of these artists were movie directors, play writers, and songwriters. Most of the recipients have been American. The President of the United States usually attends the awards ceremony. The Honors are given in Washington, D.C. at the Kennedy Center Opera House."
"From 1978 until 2002, the ceremony was hosted by Walter Cronkite. Since 2003, it has been hosted by Caroline Kennedy."
The Vicar of Wakefield
Mugello is a landscape in northern Italy. Mugello is north of Florence. The Santerno River's valley is nearby. The two valleys are separated by the Futa Pass (a path or way to cross over the mountain between those two valleys).
"In ancient times it was on the border between the area settled by the Ligurians (also called the Magelli tribe), the Etruscans and the Gauls. The Roman colonization left very few signs behind because the Mugello was mostly an agricultural area. In the Middle Ages it was home to many castles. Later on, Mugello was taken over by the Republic of Florence. Several families of the city built villas (large houses) there. They were similar to ones built by the Medici royal family."
Friar
"Friars are special monks that do a service to a community and that lead a simple life, rather than living like ascets in a monastery."
Orders.
"There are two classes of orders known as friars, or mendicant orders: the four ""great orders"" and the so-called ""lesser orders""."
Four great orders.
"The four great orders were mentioned by the Second Council of Lyons (1274), and are:"
Lesser orders.
The lesser orders are:
Carmelites
"The Order of the Brothers of Our Lady of Mount Carmel or Carmelites (sometimes simply Carmel; ) is a Roman Catholic religious order. It was probably founded in the 12th century on Mount Carmel, from which the order receives its name. Saint Bertold has traditionally been associated with the founding of the order, but few clear records of early Carmelite history have survived. The order of Carmelite nuns was made official in 1452."
Samael
"Samael () (also Sammael and Şamil) is an archangel in Talmudic and post-Talmudic beliefs and stories, as well as Christian tradition and demonology. There are also other religions that believe in stories of Samael. It is said that he was the guardian angel of Esau and a patron of the sinful empire of Rome."
"Samael is often accorded with Satan because he often has grim and destructive duties. He is often considered a fallen angel, like Satan and the chief of the evil spirits. One of Samael's roles in Jewish beliefs is that of the Angel of Death. In this belief, he is a fallen angel but remains one of the Lord's servants. As a good angel, Samael supposedly lives in the seventh heaven, although he is said to be the chief angel of the fifth heaven."
Powers.
"The website Catholic.org says Samael is a ""Power"", which means he is the chief of many warrior angels."
"Powers are warrior angels against evil, who defend the world and people. They fight against evil spirits who attempt to bring chaos through human beings. The chief is said to be either Samael or Camael, both angels of darkness."
In Judaism and Christianity.
"In Jewish beliefs, Sammael is said to be the Angel of Death, the ruler of the Fifth Heaven, and one of the seven regents of the world served by two million angels; he resides in the Seventh Heaven. ""Yalkut I, 110"" of the Talmud says Samael is Esau's guardian angel. In ""Sotah 10b"", Samael is Esau's guardian angel."
"In the ""Sayings of Rabbi Eliezer"", he is said to be the one who tempted Eve, then seduced and impregnated her with Cain. Some sources identify Gadreel as the angel that seduced Eve; although, other Hebrew scholars say that it was Samael who tempted Eve as the Serpent."
"Samael is also sometimes said to be the angel who wrestled with Jacob, and also the angel who held back the arm of Abraham as he was about to sacrifice his son."
"According to ""The Ascension of Moses"" (Chapter IV - Aggadah - The Legend of The Jews - By Louis Ginzberg) Samael is also mentioned as being in 7th Heaven:"
"""In the last heaven Moses saw two angels, each five hundred parasangs in height, forged out of chains of black fire and red fire, the angels Af, ""Anger,"" and Hemah, ""Wrath,"" whom God created at the beginning of the world, to execute His will. Moses was disquieted when he looked upon them, but Metatron embraced him, and said, ""Moses, Moses, thou favorite of God, fear not, and be not terrified,"" and Moses became calm. There was another angel in the seventh heaven, different in appearance from all the others, and of frightful mien. His height was so great, it would have taken five hundred years to cover a distance equal to it, and from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet he was studded with glaring eyes, at the sight of which the beholder fell prostrate in awe. ""This one,"" said Metatron, addressing Moses, ""is Samael, who takes the soul away from man."" ""Whither goes he now?"" asked Moses, and Metatron replied, ""To fetch the soul of Job the pious."" Thereupon Moses prayed to God in these words, ""O may it be Thy will, my God and the God of my fathers, not to let me fall into the hands of this angel."""
"In ""The Holy Kabbalah"" (Arthur Edward Waite, 255), Samael is described as the ""severity of God"", and is listed as fifth of the archangels of the world of Briah. Samael is said to have married Lilith after she left Adam. According to Zoharistic cabala, Samael was also mated with Eisheth Zenunim, Na'amah, and Agrat Bat Mahlat - all angels of prostitution."
"Samael is sometimes confused in some books with Camael, an archangel of God, whose name means ""He who sees God""."
Popular culture.
Samael is shown as a character in the Megami Tensei video game series. The archangel is shown in the games as a blood-red serpent. He is a member of the Vile Clan and is a persona of the Death Arcana.
"In the Silent Hill video games, Samael is the name of one of the town's gods. He is shown as an anthropomorphic goat."
Liber Pontificalis said:
He died on 18 October 707 and was buried in Chapel of the Blessed Virgin Mary. He was succeeded by Pope Sisinnius.
World Trade Center site
"The World Trade Center site refers to the area of land in Lower Manhattan in New York City, that hosted both the original and new World Trade Centers. The land was originally underwater. The first World Trade Center complex of buildings stood on the site until it was destroyed in the September 11 attacks. The new World Trade Center complex is mostly complete and is built on the site. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey owns most of the land. The site is overseen by Studio Daniel Libeskind, Silverstein Properties, and the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation."
September 11 attacks.
"On the morning of September 11, 2001, two airplanes were captured by terrorists close to al-Qaeda and crashed into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. The towers fell within two hours after the crashes. Nearly 3,000 people died in the attacks. After the attacks, hospital workers and police offers began calling the site ""Ground Zero""."
Debris and clean-up.
"When the towers fell, they caused dust to spread in New York City, and left hundreds of thousands of tons of debris at the site. The New York City Fire Department separated the site into four areas to make cleanup of the site and the search for people who survived the attack easier. Early on, it was said that the debris at the site would take a year to get rid of, but cleanup ended in May 2002. Building materials and debris from Ground Zero were sent to the Fresh Kills Landfill in Staten Island."
"In December 2001, a viewing area at Fulton Street, between Church Street and Broadway, was opened to the public."
"On March 11, 2002, six months after the attacks, the Tribute in Light, a memorial with two beams of light shooting straight up into the sky, began. It was lit up every day at dusk until April 14, 2002. After that, it was lit up for the second anniversary of the attacks, on September 11, 2003. It has been lit up every September 11 since then."
New buildings.
The new World Trade Center complex will have the following buildings:
"Soon after the September 11 attacks, Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Governor George Pataki, and President George W. Bush said that they would rebuild the World Trade Center. On the day of the attacks, Giuliani said, ""We will rebuild. We're going to come out of this stronger than before, politically stronger, economically stronger. The skyline will be made whole again."" During a visit to the site on September 14, 2001, Bush spoke to a crowd of workers through a megaphone. A person in the crowd shouted, ""I can't hear you,"" to which Bush replied, ""I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon."""
"In an address to Congress, the president said, ""As a symbol of America's resolve, my administration will work with Congress, and these two leaders, to show the world that we will rebuild New York City."" However, 20 years after the attacks, only four buildings, One World Trade Center, 3 World Trade Center, 4 World Trade Center and 7 World Trade Center, have been rebuilt. One building, One World Trade Center, is currently under construction."
"In November 2001, Governor Pataki started the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (LMDC) to oversee the rebuilding of the World Trade Center. The LMDC leads federal help in the rebuilding, and works with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Larry Silverstein, and Studio Daniel Libeskind. It also communicates with the local community, businesses, the city of New York, and the families of the people who were killed in the September 11 attacks."
National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum.
"A memorial, ""Reflecting Absence"", honors the people killed in the September 11 attacks and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. It was designed by Peter Walker and Israeli-American architect Michael Arad. It has a field of trees with the footprints of the original towers. The footprints are filled with pools of water. It opened on the tenth anniversary of the attacks, on September 11, 2011."
"On October 12, 2004, the LMDC announced that Gehry Partners LLP and Snøhetta, an architectural company from Norway, would design a performing arts center and museum at the site. It is a museum and a visitors' center for the site. The museum opened in 2014."

"An episode of CBS's ""60 Minutes"" in 2010 was about the lack of work done at Ground Zero. It focused on how most of the buildings did not have a date for completion, the main building, One World Trade Center (originally called the Freedom Tower), having gone through three different designs, and the delays and high amount of money that went into the rebuilding. Larry Silverstein said that the entire site would be completed in 2037, and that billions of dollars have been spent on rebuilding the site, even though Ground Zero ""is still a hole in the ground."" During an interview for the episode, Silverstein said, ""I am the most frustrated person in the world...I'm seventy-eight years of age; I want to see this thing done in my lifetime."" However, it was said in early 2011 that a lot of work has been done on the site, with all five buildings under construction. All of the buildings will be completed between 2012 and 2016. Criticism of the work being done at Ground Zero was made in 2008 and 2009, when there was no work being done at the site."
River Humber
"The River Humber is a large deep water estuary on the east coast of Northern England. It is formed by the River Ouse and the River Trent coming together. From here to the North Sea (about 40 miles) it forms part of the border between the East Riding of Yorkshire on the north side and Lincolnshire on the south side. The Humber's only modern crossing is the Humber Bridge. At one time it the longest single-span suspension bridge in the world. Now it is the fifth longest. Before the bridge was built in 1981, paddle steamers were used to cross the mile long span."
History.
"In the middle ages the tides of the Humber kept armies from crossing. At that time it was thought to be an arm of the ocean. During the Anglo-Saxon period, the Humber was a major boundary, separating Northumbria from the southern kingdoms. The name Northumbria came from Old English ""Northanhymbre"" meaning ""the people north of the Humber"". The Vikings used the Humber and its two tributaries, the Ouse and Trent, with their shallow-draft Longships to raid all over northeastern England."
Fortresses.
Fort Paull was a Napoleonic era fort built in 1542 to protect the port there. The site dates back to 910 when it was a lookout for Viking raiders. The current fort is designed as a pentagon and was built from 1861–1864. It was disarmed at the beginning of the First World War and replaced by two nearby forts. One was on Sunk Island; the other was at Stallingborough. In 1960 the fort was finally closed down. But in 1964 a group of volunteers took over the fort and made it into a Museum.
France Roche
"France Roche (2 April 1921 – 14 December 2013) was a French actress and screenwriter. She appeared in 17 movies between 1951 and 1979. She died on 14 December 2013 from natural causes, aged 92."
"On the Monopoly board are 40 spaces. In the four corners of the board are ""GO"", ""Free Parking"", ""JAIL"", and ""Go to Jail"". Along the sides of the board are properties (streets and businesses) for sale. The properties are: 22 ""streets"" (each marked with one of eight colors), 4 ""railroad stations"", the ""Electric Company"" and the ""Water Works"". There are also spaces called ""Income Tax"", ""Luxury Tax"", ""Community Chest"" and ""Chance""."
"In the original version, the properties and railroad stations were named after the streets in Atlantic City in New Jersey in the United States. In the British original version, they are named after streets in London."
Setting up the Game.
"To prepare for the game, the board is put in position. The Chance and Community Chest cards are shuffled and placed face down on the board. Each player chooses a token (a playing piece), such as a thimble, a rocking horse, a boot, a dog, etc. (the tokens vary depending on the edition), and places it on ""GO"". One player is chosen to be the banker - this player is trusted with handing out money from the bank and collecting players' spent money during the game."
"The banker gives each player $1500 to start with. Each player rolls the dice, and the player who rolled the highest total takes the first turn."
Rules.
The object of the game is to own as much land (property) and to be the richest player.
"The rules can be found in every ""Monopoly"" box, but a summary is listed here."
Moving Around The Board.
"On your turn, you roll the dice and move your token forward (clockwise around the edge of the board) the same number of spaces as the sum of the dice you rolled. You must then follow the instructions of whatever space your token lands on."
"If you roll doubles (the same number on both dice), you get to take another turn after this one is over. However, if you roll doubles three times in a row, you don't get your third turn but you must go directly to Jail (see below)."
Jail.
"The Jail space has two sections, labeled IN JAIL and JUST VISITING. If you land on Jail by your normal roll of the dice, place your token on JUST VISITING and nothing bad (or good) happens to you. But there are three ways to be placed IN JAIL:"
"If you are put into Jail, take your token from wherever it is and place it directly on IN JAIL. This does not count as a move, so if this causes you to go past GO, you don't collect $200 from the Bank. If you are put in Jail, your turn ends immediately, even if you rolled doubles and would get to take another turn."
"While you are in Jail, you still roll the dice on your turn but you don't get to move your token. There are three ways to get out of Jail:"
Note that being in Jail doesn't prevent you from doing anything else in the game - it just stops your token from moving around the board.
Different editions.
"There are many editions of Monopoly. Officially-licensed editions are produced by Hasbro itself or by USAopoly, and unofficial editions are published by Toy Vault. Official versions are named ""____ Monopoly"" (such as ""Star Wars Monopoly"") and feature the Monopoly logo, and unofficial versions are named ""____-Opoly"" (such as ""Python-Opoly"") and do not feature the Monopoly logo."
"Milton Bradley has produced editions to symbolize the decades of popular culture in America. For example, The 1970s Monopoly has spaces depicting the fashion of the time. Players can purchase bell bottom blue jeans instead of street properties."
"A number of video game adaptations have been made. In addition, many electronic editions exist that use credit cards instead of paper money."
"In India, a similar game is called Business."
"In Egypt, a similar game is called بنك الحظ (The Bank of Luck)."
"Acquire is another game with rules for more advanced business practices with stocks, but has similar basic concepts of Monopoly (owning properties of the same color, buying land and building on it, making the most money, etc.)."
Uses for Monopoly.
"People play Monopoly for different reasons. Some may play for family game night, others use it as a learning tool at school, and others play it just to have fun."
"Monopoly may be used as a teaching tool to teach children a variety of lessons while having fun. It teaches how to make deals when trading, playing fair (because cheaters never win), knowing the value of money, addition and subtraction, good sportsmanship, the thrill of competition, strategies and organization. At an elementary level, “it offers a marvelous vehicle for teaching mathematics”. Through the game, children explore different areas of mathematics: not only adding and subtracting but also probability, percentages, and patterns. At a higher level, teachers can use Monopoly to teach microeconomics principles."
Still Standing
"Still Standing is a CBS sitcom starring Mark Addy. It is about a working-class couple who live in Chicago, Illinois. Addy's character is a father of three with a wife named Judy (Jami Gertz). Judy and Addy's character, Bill Miller, deal with having an annoying relative, Aunt Linda (Jennifer Irwin), and with having children of different ages. It was first shown in September 2002. Lifetime had the rights to have the show in 2005. It ended in March 2006."
IGN
"IGN is a gaming website that was first launched in 2000. It has FAQ's, guides, and walkthroughs about many of the games on GameCube, PC, PlayStation 2, Xbox, Wii, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and the PlayStation 4, as well as older systems. IGN's main competitor is GameSpot, another gaming website."
"There are about 8.4 million people in Switzerland. About 64% of the people speak Swiss German (German Alemannic) as their first language, in northern and central Switzerland. 19% of the people speak French as their first language, mainly in the west of Switzerland. 8% of the people speak Italian, in the south of Switzerland. Only 1% of the people speak Romansh, in the southeastern part of Switzerland. Romansh is an old language that is similar to Latin."
"The German-speaking people of Switzerland do not actually speak ""German"" as their native language. Swiss people speak something called Alemannic which has its own writing language and grammar but still is normally considered a German dialect. Alemannic may be difficult for Germans to understand. Swiss people do write like the people from Germany and also speak standard German very well, especially in the larger cities."
About 23% of the people in Switzerland do not come from Switzerland. They come from other places to usually work in Switzerland.
"The religion of most people in Switzerland is Christianity. 43% of the population follow Catholicism. 35% of the population follow Protestantism. 2% follow Eastern Orthodoxy. The religion of 4% of the population is Islam. The rest follow other religions, or they have no religion."
"Switzerland is famous for its chocolate, cheese, banking system, watches and mountains."
History.
"In 1291, people from Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden wanted to be free. They signed a contract to work together called the ""Eternal Alliance"". Together, they could be free from the people of Habsburg, who were very strong. In 1315 the people from the Eternal Alliance fought the Habsburgs in battles at Morgarten, Sempach and Näfels. The people of the Eternal Alliance won all the battles."
"People from other areas signed the contract and joined the Eternal Alliance. More and more people worked together to be free. In 1648, other countries from Europe made an agreement that Switzerland was free. The name of this agreement was the ""Peace of Westphalia"". More areas came to be part of Switzerland."
"Switzerland was important to the slave trade that forced black Africans to be sold as slaves. Swiss companies made indiennes, which are a kind of cloth. These cloths were sent to Africa and exchanged for captured slaves. Some Swiss also joined French companies already making indiennes or owned plantations with slaves in French colonies."
"In 1798, France invaded Switzerland. The ruler of France was Napoleon. He changed many laws. In 1815 Switzerland again became independent from France. Other countries agreed at the Congress of Vienna that Switzerland was free and neutral."
"The constitution of Switzerland that was made after a short civil war in 1848 was replaced in 1999. Switzerland did not fight in World War I or World War II. Since 2002, Switzerland is part of the United Nations. It did not join the United Nations for 57 years because of its neutrality."
Government.
"Switzerland is a republic. Switzerland does not have the same kind of president as the United States or France. Seven people (called ministers) do the job of president. They are called the Federal Council in English, ""Bundesrat"" in German, ""Conseil Fédéral"" in French, ""Consiglio Federale"" in Italian and ""Cussegl Federal"" in Romansh. Every year one of these people is made president. The president is not more important than the other six people. At present 3 of the 7 people are women."
The seven people are:
"There are two parts of parliament in Switzerland. The ""Council of States"" and the ""National Council"". Only both together can make laws. There are 46 people in the Council of States. Every full canton of Switzerland can send 2 people. There are 200 people in the National Council. The biggest canton sends most people to the National Council. The smallest 6 cantons can only send one person to the National Council."
"The people of Switzerland can collect signatures if they do not like a new law or a law change. This is called a ""referendum"". If enough people sign a referendum, the people vote. The people can also collect signatures to change the constitution. This is called an ""initiative"". The constitution is the basic law of a country."
Economy.
"Switzerland is not a member of the European Union, but it is member of the European Free Trade Agreement (EFTA). The EFTA makes trade with other countries in Europe easier. In 1999 Switzerland and the European Union made a contract. This contract makes trade even easier. They recently made two other contracts."
"The banks of Switzerland and the insurance companies in Switzerland together produce eleven per cent of the gross domestic product. Tourism is important in Switzerland. There are many places for tourists. Davos, St. Moritz, Pontresina and Flims are in Switzerland. These towns are important both in winter (for skiing) and in summer. Tourists also like the cities of Lucerne, Geneva, and Zürich."
"In 2011 the pharmaceutical industry in Switzerland directly and indirectly employed about 135,000 people. The companies Novartis and Roche are the second and third largest pharma companies in the world. They both have invented many life saving drugs because of well developed research and development facilities."
Literature.
The literature of Switzerland is divided according to the language used. Most Swiss literature was written in German from 1291 until 1798. French became popular in Bern and elsewhere in the 18th century and many words also in the German speaking parts of Switzerland come from the French and are not known to Germans. Italian language and Romansch-Latin literature are less common in Switzerland.
"Heidi, a book for children by Johanna Spyri, is the most famous book of Switzerland. It is in the mountains in Graubünden."
Sports.
"Skiing, snowboarding and mountaineering are among the most popular sports in Switzerland. Because of the large mountain range the nature of the country is well suited for such activities. Bobsleigh was invented in St. Moritz. The first world ski championships were held in Mürren (1931) and St. Moritz (1934). St. Moritz hosted the second Winter Olympic Games in 1928 and in 1948. Among the most successful skiers and world champions are Pirmin Zurbriggen and Didier Cuche."
"Many Swiss are fans of football. The national team or 'Nati' is widely supported. Switzerland was the joint host, with Austria, of the Euro 2008 tournament. Many Swiss also follow ice hockey. In April 2009, Switzerland hosted the 2009 IIHF World Championship for the 10th time. The National League A is the most attended league in Europe."
"The many lakes in the country make Switzerland a good place for sailing. The largest, Lake Geneva, is the home of the sailing team Alinghi. They were the first European team to win the America's Cup in 2003. They also won in 2007. Tennis has become more popular. Swiss players such as Martina Hingis and Roger Federer have won multiple Grand Slams."
"Motorsport racecourses and events were banned in Switzerland after the 1955 Le Mans disaster. There were exceptions for events such as Hillclimbing. This ban was overturned in June 2007. During this period, the country still had successful racing drivers such as Clay Regazzoni, Sebastian Buemi, Jo Siffert and successful World Touring Car Championship driver Alain Menu. Switzerland also won the A1GP World Cup of Motorsport in 2007–08 with driver Neel Jani. Swiss motorcycle racer Thomas Lüthi won the 2005 MotoGP World Championship in the 125cc category."
"Traditional sports include Swiss wrestling or ""Schwingen"". It is an old tradition from the rural central cantons and considered the national sport by some. Hornussen is another native Swiss sport. It is like a cross between baseball and golf. Steinstossen is the Swiss version of stone put, a competition in throwing a heavy stone. It is recorded to have taken place in Basel in the 13th century. It is also central to the Unspunnenfest, first held in 1805."
LOL
"LOL, or lol, is an internet slang term that means ""laugh(ing) out loud"". It is commonly mistaken for ""lots of love."" LOL is often used in messages meaning ""That is really funny."""
Nigger
"Nigger is a racist insult against black people. It can also be referred to as the ""hard R"", due to the word ending in 'er' instead of 'a', like the word with a similar meaning - ""nigga"". Like the word ""nigga"", it can be used in pop culture slang. However, it is mainly used by those who believe that white people are better than everybody else."
"The word came from a slang pronunciation of ""negro"", which is the word for the color black and for black people in Spanish and Portuguese. Before 1865, most black people in the United States were slaves. During this time, the word ""nigger"" usually meant a slave. Writers such as Joseph Conrad, Mark Twain, and Charles Dickens used it."
"Today, the word is an offensive racial slur in English, and is often thought as hate speech. ""Nigger"" has become so offensive to say that most people do not use the word; instead, they call it the ""N-word""."
Biography
"A biography is the story of a person's life. The word comes from the Greek words ""bios"" (which means life) and ""graphein"" (which means write). When the biography is written by the person it is about, it is called an autobiography."
A written biography is a part of literature. Biographies can also be made as movies (often called biopics) or told as stories.
"The oldest written biographies that historians have were written to record rulers' lives. Some were written in Assyria, ancient Babylonia, ancient Egypt and ancient Mesopotamia. Biographies were an early form of history. Another early form of biography was called ""hagiography,"" meaning writing about holy people."
"In ancient China, a biography was one of the basic forms of a history book. In India, biographies of Buddha and his reincarnated lives were written. In ancient Greece, people wrote biographies of people that were not rulers too. Xenophon wrote a biography of Socrates and gave this book the name ""Memorabilia"" (Memories). During the Roman Empire, Plutarch wrote ""Parallel Lives"" about ancient Greek and Roman politicians, and Suetonius wrote biographies of the Roman emperors. The Gospels were also biographies of Jesus Christ."
"In West Africa, griots tell histories which often include biographies."
Many written biographies today are released by publishers as products for sale.
Ralph Nader
"Ralph Nader (born February 27, 1934) is an American attorney, politician and political activist. He is best known for working for the rights of consumers, for his third party runs for President of the United States, and for helping George Bush get elected in the 2000 presidential election. He ran for president in 1996, 2000 and 2004, but failed to win. In the 2008 election, Nader placed third overall, with 660,094 votes, or about .38%. Nader was born in Winsted, Connecticut. His parents, Nathra and Rose Nader, were Lebanese immigrants. He is a fluent and native speaker of the Arabic language."
Jamie Farr
"Jamie Farr (born July 1, 1934) is an American actor of Lebanese descent. He is best known for his role as Corp./later Sgt. Maxwell Q. Klinger on the 1970s TV show, ""M*A*S*H"". His real name is Jameel Joseph Farha and he was born in Toledo, Ohio."
"Farr also appeared in movies like ""The Blackboard Jungle"" (1955) and ""The Cannonball Run"" (1980), was a regular ""celebrity judge"" on ""The Gong Show"" and has a golf tournament named after him."
Free software
"Free software is software (computer program) that anyone may run, share and change, at any time, for any reason. In this case, ""free"" means ""freedom-respecting"" (we say ""free as in freedom""). The opposite of free software is proprietary software."
"In 1984, Richard Stallman started the free software movement when he began the GNU project. Examples of free software are Linux (the kernel), Blender, OpenBSD, Inkscape and others. Wikipedia also uses free software."
Free software and open source.
"Free software is very similar, but different from open source software."
People who use the name “free software” think that computers should be more ethical and should try to help people who use computers. They think every human should have four basic rights for their programs. These are the rights to:
The Free software movement also says that all software should be free (as in freedom). It is because even a very small program that is proprietary can be very dangerous (it can for example spy on the user).
"People who use the name “open source” refer to the same software following the same rules, but the community isn't as strict and doesn't say that everything should be open source. They avoid the ethics and instead say the rules are good because they help companies make business."
How free software works.
"An author who wants to make his computer program free must allow other people to use it for anything (which doesn't break the law), study it, change it and share it without limits. The author does this by using a free license."
"The author must not prohibit even selling his program by others or using his program for dangerous things or using it by people he doesn't like. This is not because the author supports bad things, but because he thinks that limiting user's rights is dangerous for them."
Free software and freeware.
"On 17 June 2018, North Macedonia and Greece agreed to the Prespa agreement which would see the country change its name to the Republic of North Macedonia. The government started completing the constitutional change needed to change the country's name, which was completed on 12 February 2019."
Politics.
North Macedonia is a democratic country with a parliament.
Anorexia nervosa
Anorexia nervosa (usually just called anorexia) is an eating disorder.
"People with anorexia think that they are fat, or desperately fear becoming fat even if they are very skinny. To try to lose weight, anorexics do not eat enough. When they do eat, they do not eat the amount of food their body needs, in an effort to avoid gaining weight. This causes them to lose too much weight too quickly. This is very harmful to a person's body. There are various treatments for anorexia. One example is the Maudsley Method. This type of treatment is for patients who are 18 or younger. Two thirds of adolescent anorexia patients are 'recovered' at the end of this treatment. People with anorexia are more likely to die than people with any other mental illness."
Diagnosis.
"Doctors use the ""Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders"" to make a medical diagnosis and decide if a person has anorexia or not. Four signs of anorexia are listed in the manual. People do not have to show all four signs for the doctor to decide that they have anorexia."
Causes.
"There is no single cause of anorexia. Researchers believe that it is caused by a combination of biological and environmental factors. It has been linked to the media. Many people think that anorexia is caused by wanting to be thin like models in magazines. However, it is not that simple."
"People who develop anorexia tend to be perfectionistic. They are also more likely to have problems socializing. There has been research about the link between anorexia and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a disorder that involves problems with socializing. Another symptom of autism spectrum disorder is OCD, which has also been linked to anorexia. Starvation is known to create antisocial behavior so there needs to be research that compares those traits in anorexics with people who have recovered."
Madness
Madness (or Insanity) is a word that can have different meanings:
"Being able to tell right from wrong is the base of a working society and of law; for this reason, the law treats those people differently who are not able to make this distinction. In the law, when people who can’t understand that their crimes are crimes it’s called the insanity defense."
Rabies
"Rabies is a neurotropic (referring to the nuerons) virus, viral zoonotic disease (can spread to humans by animals) that causes acute encephalitis."
"The disease is almost always fatal (people and animals die from it) when the symptoms start. There is no treatment and cure for it when the symptoms occur. However, people (and pets) who are treated with vaccines soon after becoming infected have a very good chance to survive."
"The disease is transmitted through the saliva and the blood. The usual form of getting it is a bite of a rabid mammal. Pets, like dogs need to be vaccinated against it, in most countries."
Treatment.
"There is no cure for rabies. There is a vaccine (medicine to try to prevent rabies) against it. The vaccine was first developed by Louis Pasteur and Pierre Paul Émile Roux in 1885. This vaccine used a live virus grown in rabbits, and weakened (through drying it). The first person to be vaccinated was Joseph Meister (a 9-year-old boy who had been bitten by a dog). Vaccines similar to this are still used today, but other vaccines (growing the virus using cell cultures) are more used."
"There is also a form of treatment that can be done once a person has been bitten. It needs to be done within 6 days of being bitten. There is no way to know whether someone is infected, until it's too late. Treatment starts with washing the wound. This is done to reduce the number of virus particles that enter the body. Often patients are given one dose of immunoglobulin and a certain number of vaccines, over a determined period of time, usually a month."
Tirana
"Tirana ( or ""Tirana"") is the capital city of Republic of Albania. It is the largest city in that country. According to 2011 census, the population of the city was 621,286 people. Other people think there may be up to 1 million people who live in the city. Tirana was founded in 1614. It became Albania's capital city in 1920."
"The origin of the city name is unknown. According to one of the versions, its name comes from Tyrkanos Castle, which was near the current location of Tirana."
John Forbes Nash Jr.
"John Forbes Nash Jr. (June 13, 1928 – May 23, 2015) was an American mathematician who worked in game theory and differential geometry. He was born in Bluefield, West Virginia. He shared the 1994 Memorial Prize in Economics with two other game theorists, Reinhard Selten and John Harsanyi."
Early life.
"Scallops and file clams can swim to escape a predator, clapping their valves together to create a jet of water. Cockles can use their foot to leap from danger. However these methods quickly exhaust the animal. In the razor shells the siphons can break off only to grow back later."
Defensive secretions.
"The file shells can produce a noxious secretion when threatened, and the fan shells of the same family have a unique, acid-producing organ."
Comparison with brachiopods.
"Bivalves are superficially similar to brachiopods, but the construction of the shell is completely different in the two groups. In brachiopods, the two valves are on the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the body, while in bivalves, they are on the left and right sides."
"Bivalves appeared late in the Cambrian explosion and came to increase in the Palaeozoic, and dominate over brachiopods during the Mesozoic. So, it was thought that bivalves are better adapted to aquatic life than the brachiopods, and this caused brachiopods to be out-competed and relegated to minor niches."
"However, after the Permian-Triassic extinction event bivalves had a huge adaptive radiation while brachiopods were devastated, losing 95% of their diversity."
The upshot was that bivalves took over the desirable inshore habitats. Brachiopods now live in deeper waters where food is scarcer.

Bishop
Bishop is a type of clergy in some Christian churches. The bishop is the leader of the Christians and the Christian priests in each diocese. The diocese which a bishop governs is called a bishopric. Episcopal is the adjective for bishops. A cathedral is the church building where the bishop has an episcopal throne. The cathedral is the main church of the diocese and the bishop's see. A bishop may be given the rank of archbishop in an archdiocese.
"Christian priests in some denominations must be made priests by bishops. In these denominations, bishops are above parish priests in the hierarchy of the church's organization. However, some Protestant denominations have no bishops or archbishops. The Presbyterianism is an example. The leader of the Church of Scotland is the Moderator. The General Assembly elects the Moderator of the Church of Scotland each year. Other Christian movements have neither bishops nor priests: Quakers are one example."
"In the Catholic church, the Pope is chosen by all the cardinals from amongst their number. According to church law, this does not have to be the case: any male, unmarried, baptized Christian who is judged fit for the office can become pope. However, the last pope who was not a bishop was Urban VI (elected in 1378)."
"The pope is also 'the Bishop of Rome'. In fact he rules an independent state within Rome, called the Vatican. All Roman Catholic bishops answer to the pope (or to patriarchs in some orthodox churches). In the Anglican church, bishops are governed by Archbishops."
"Usually a bishop can be identified by a special hat, called a mitre."
Tray
A tray is a shallow container designed for carrying things.
"Trays are flat, but with raised edges to stop things from sliding off of them. They are often rectangular, and may or may not have handles with which to carry them."
"A butler's tray has a deeper surround, handles on the short sides (usually cut into the surround) so that it can be easily carried, and folding legs. It is used to carry drinks, and can be used as a side table."
Orkney Islands
"The Orkney Islands (often also called only Orkney) is an archipelago in the Northern Isles of Scotland, United Kingdom. It is about 16 kilometres north of Caithness. 20 of the about 70 islands have people living on them. The administrative centre is Kirkwall (with about 8000 people living there). The next largest settlements are Stromness (2000 people) and St. Margaret's Hope (with about 550 people)."
"In addition to the mainland, most of the islands are in two groups, the North and South Isles. All of them are made of sandstone. The climate is mild and the soil is fertile. Most of the land is farmed and agriculture is the main source of income for the economy. There are many birds and fish."
Transportation.
"Ferry services go much of the time to Lerwick (in Shetland). Most islands have air strips (for airplanes). This includes the shortest known flight service in the world, between Westray and Papa Westray. Official flight time is 2 minutes. If the wind goes in the right direction, the flight can take just over a minute."
Methodism
Primatology
"Primatology is a type of science that is part of zoology. It studies primates (monkeys, apes, lemurs, and humans). Primatology is a part of physical anthropology. A person who studies primatology is a primatologists. They can work in many different fields of study. These include biology, zoology, anthropology and psychology."
"A large amount of information about primatology has been learned since the end of World War II in the United States, Canada, Western Europe and Japan. In the United States, primatologists work mostly in the fields of psychology and anthropology."
Orangutan
"Orangutans (""Pongo"") are great apes belonging to the rainforests of Indonesia and Malaysia. There are two species of orangutan. They are from Southeast Asia. There are very few of them left, because loss of the jungle has reduced their habitat. There are orangutans on view at the Singapore zoo."
"The name orangutan comes from two Malay words, ""orang"" which means ""person"", and ""hutan"" which means ""forest""; so orangutan means ""person of the forest""."
Appearance.
"Orangutans have red-brown hair. They have long arms. They can be strong like chimpanzees, gorillas and humans. They also have hands that are good for climbing. The ""Sumatran Orangutan"" is smaller and has longer hair than the ""Bornean orangutan"". Orangutans have suffered from forest loss and are on the very edge of extinction."
Life.
"Orangutans are from the rainforests on the islands Borneo and Sumatra in Southeast Asia. They mostly live up in the trees. They eat fruit, leaves and bark and also insects and bird eggs. They drink water from rain that has been collected in leaves. Orangutans are not comfortable on the ground since they have to push themselves along with fists. Heavy adults move carefully through the trees, using their flexible feet to grasp the tree branches. Smaller orangutans swing with more ease."
Diet.
"An orangutan's diet consists mainly of fruit, they like ripe fruit. If they cannot find fruit they will eat bark, leaves and termites, rather than move to somewhere else to get food. About 60% of an orangutan's diet is fruit, 25% is leaves, 10% is bark and flowers, and 5% is termites and other insects."
Pregnancy.
"After a pregnancy of 230–260 days the female gives birth to usually one baby, but sometimes two, every eight to nine years. The little ones stay with their mother for years, riding on their mother's back and learning to move through the forest. The young orangutans are playful and affectionate. When they are five or six years old, they become more independent and eventually go off on their own."
Greeting
Greetings are nice things to say when people meet each other. Greetings may be different from culture to culture. These are some greetings used a lot in the English language:
"There are also ways to greet without talking, such as these:"
Sunlight
"Sunlight is the light and energy that comes from the Sun. When this energy reaches the earth's surface, it is called insolation. What we experience as sunlight is actually solar radiation. It is the radiation and heat from the Sun in the form of electromagnetic waves."
"The atmosphere affects the amount of solar radiation received. When solar radiation travels through the atmosphere, some of it is absorbed by the atmosphere (16%). Some of it is scattered to space (6%). Some of it is reflected by clouds (28%). About 47% of it reaches the Earth's surface."
"Without sunlight, there could not be life on the Earth. Plants need sunlight for the process of photosynthesis. During photosynthesis the plants use the energy of the sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide, to create glucose (sugar). The glucose can later be used by the plant for energy or animals eat the plant and the glucose in it. Plants need sunlight to grow green. Without enough sunlight but with enough water, the plant grows very tall very quickly, but looks yellow and dehydrated, although when touched, the leaves are very moist."
"Solar radiation can be both good and bad for a person's health. When in the light, the human body uses the ultraviolet part of sunlight to make its own Vitamin D. Without sunscreen too much ultraviolet light can cause sunburn and skin cancer. Sun angle makes difference in seasons on Earth as well as in the length of day and night. A high angle makes the tropics hot, and a low angle makes the arctic cold."
Intensity of sunlight on planets of Solar System.
Different bodies of the Solar System receive sunlight of different intensities. The table compares the amount of light received by each planet on the Solar System follows:
Use of solar energy.
"Solar energy is used in many different ways by people all over the world both in its traditional way for heating, cooking or drying and to make electricity where other power supplies are absent, such as in remote places on Earth or in the space. Sometimes, it is cheaper to make electricity from sunlight than from coal or oil."
Theism
Settings.
'The Force'.
The Force is a mystical power. Those who can harness if for good follow a religion known as the Jedi. It is a belief that the force flows through every living thing. In the words of Obi-Wan Kenobi:
"People who can control the Force with their minds get a number of psychic powers, such telepathy (reading others thoughts), telekenesis (moving things with their minds), precognition (knowing about things before they happen) and mind control (telling people commands they must follow)."
The Jedi and the Sith.
"The Jedi are a group of beings who use the Force to bring peace and harmony to people, planets, and cultures. They are trained to use the force for good purposes. They are sworn enemies with another group called the Sith."
"The Sith are a group of beings who use the force as a power source; they are trained to use the force to gain ultimate power. The Sith normally use the force to gain power in battles with their enemy who are the Jedi. They also use the force to bring destruction to the universe and anything in their way. They are the antagonists, and they usually use red lightsabers in contrast to the variety of colors used by the Jedi. There are usually only two Sith, a master and an apprentice."
Lightsaber.
"The lightsaber is a dangerous and powerful weapon used by the Jedi and the Sith. It can be described simply as a light sword. These weapons are very special to a Jedi or Sith. They are custom built to special specifications by the Jedi or Sith. The Sith tend to take a Jedi's lightsaber as a prize if they win the battle. Many epic battles have been fought with lightsabers between the Jedi and the Sith. For the lightsaber to be a weapon it is powered by a special crystal called a kyber crystal.The kyber crystal comes in many different cololrs such as: Red, white, yellow, orange, and many more. The reason it is powerful and dangerous is that when someone touches the blade, one gets burned straight away."
Story.
"Anakin Skywalker is a young boy who meets Obi-Wan Kenobi and learns the ways of the Force (and to become a Jedi). Although Jedi are not allowed to get married, as an adult, Anakin falls in love with Senator Padmé Amidala and they get married. Anakin later goes to the Dark Side and turns against Obi-Wan Kenobi and the rest of the Jedi. Then Darth Sidious renames him Darth Vader. Before he turned against his wife, Anakin had two children with Senator Amidala, Leia and Luke Skywalker, who he does not know about. Senator Amidala dies after giving birth to their twins. After birth, the twins are separated to prevent Vader and the Dark Side from finding and hurting the children. Obi-Wan Kenobi sends Luke to a planet called Tatooine to live with his Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru. Leia is raised by Senator Bail Organa of the planet Alderaan; she is called Princess Leia Organa."
"When they get older, Luke and Leia meet again. At first they don't know that they are brother and sister, but they eventually find out. They help fight the evil government, called the Galactic Empire. Luke also learns the ways of the Jedi from Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda. In the end, they defeat the Empire, with the help of the Rebellion, and Luke helps his father Anakin become good again. Unfortunately, Anakin dies. The galaxy is then saved for a while."
"Thirty years later, however, the Empire rises again in the form of the First Order. However, the New Republic does not believe that it is a threat. Those who do believe form the Resistance, led by Leia. Luke has vanished, and Leia has married Han Solo. They had a child, named Ben, but Ben was corrupted by the First Order and a dark-side force user named Snoke and is now called Kylo Ren. Rey, a desert scavenger, fights with Han against the First Order, but Kylo Ren kills his father. However, Rey still manages to gain a large defeat against the First Order with the help of the Resistance. Rey then finds Luke, who was searching for the first Jedi Temple and for more knowledge about the Jedi, however Rey is then disappointed to see that Luke has given up on the Jedi. Meanwhile, the Resistance is slowly being wiped out ship-by-ship as they are chased by Snoke's ""Supremacy"", and on the verge of the faction's death, Vice-Admiral Holdo rams the Resistance's flagship into the First Order fleet to save the resistance. The remnants are later forced to an old rebel base in the planet Crait, where they put up a valiant fight but are slowly wiped out until Luke, the Spark of the Resistance, shows up in a vision to grant time for the others to escape, becoming one with the force in the process."
Star Wars creatures and droids (robots).
The Caretakers of Ahch-To
"The manatee nuns from “The Last Jedi” may not take an immediate liking to Rey, but we sure like them. These wise caretakers in cream-colored habits are as cute as they are intense."
Ewoks
"Yes, Lucas went overboard with the killer teddy bears of Endor, populating film and TV projects with these forest fuzz-warriors. And it was their very engineered-for-cuteness factor that first divided Star Wars fans as pro- and anti-Ewok a long time ago — even if some naysayers softened a bit after the bar was lowered in 1999 by Jar Jar Binks."
R2-D2 and C-3PO
"Although the narrative may separate them, they are an inseparable joint entry here, befitting their place as a great action-comedy team. R2-D2 is the droid that Resistance royals are forever looking for — the beeping do-it-all mechanic and sometime projector. And C-3PO is the know-it-all, fussy butler of protocol, languages and odds-making."
Expanded universe.
"Many books, short movies, and video games have been produced that deal with events that do not happen in the original movies. They also tell more about things that did happen in the movies. For example, the book ""Death Star"" tells about the building and destruction of the space station from the original movie. It tells much about things seen in that movie but from the point of view of the people on the station. A different example is that in the Expanded Universe, sometimes the Sith are shown as the protagonists. Most of the stories in the Expanded Universe are about the rebuilding of the Republic after the Empire's defeat. They are set anywhere from the early Sith Wars which happened 5,000 years before to more than one hundred years after Episode VI."

Korean language
The Korean language is spoken mainly in North and South Korea. It is spoken by more than 78 million people (most are North or South Koreans).
"In South Korea, it is called ""hangukmal"" (한국말) or ""hangugeo"" (Hangeul: 한국어, Hanja: 韓國語). In North Korea, however, it is called ""choseonmal"" (조선말) or ""choseoneo"" (조선어, 朝鮮語). They are named differently because the common names for North and South Korea are different. Additionally, Koreans usually call their language ""urimal"" (Hangeul: 우리말) or ""urinara mal"" (Hangeul: 우리나라 말), meaning ""our language"" or ""our country's language."""
Writing.
The town has a railway station on the Welsh Marches Line.
Panthera
Panthera is a genus of the family Felidae.
"It has five living species, which are the biggest cats in the Felidae. The tiger is the largest ""Panthera"" species, and the largest of all cats. The leopard is the smallest ""Panthera"" species."
"Results of genetic analysis indicate that the snow leopard also belongs to the ""Panthera"", a classification that was accepted by IUCN assessors in 2008. The genus ""Neofelis"" is also closely related."
Superpower
"A superpower is a country that is one of the most powerful countries in the world. It is more powerful than a great power and less powerful than a hyperpower. Right now, only the United States is a superpower. However, China may become a superpower in the future. Some say it is already one. Others say that it will not become a superpower."
"In the years following World War II, the United Nations was formed. The 5 countries that would later have nuclear bombs – those who would be able to start a nuclear war – were all given ""permanent"" seats on the Security Council. This means they are on the Security Council forever. They were also all given equal veto power over decisions in the Security Council. These five countries were: United States, United Kingdom, China, France, and the Soviet Union."
"For most of the 1900s, the Soviet Union was a superpower. After the Soviet Union split into a lot of smaller countries in 1991, it was not a superpower anymore. Russia got most of the Soviet Union's nuclear weapons, and also its permanent seat in the Security Council. Some other countries also have nuclear weapons now, and can also start a nuclear war just as well, but they are not permanent members with veto power. The Republic of India, and Pakistan are a few countries like this. In order to be a superpower, a country must dominate economic, cultural, and military as well as diplomatic influence."
Snow leopard
"The snow leopard (""Panthera uncia""), also known as the Irbis and ounce, is a feline, which lives in central Asia. It used to be thought not to be closely related to the smaller leopard, which is why they were put in different genera before. However, recent research has discovered this is not correct. The cat is closely related to the other big cats in the genus ""Panthera""."
Appearance.
"Snow leopards are about 2-5 meters long in the body, and have a 90-100 centimeter long tail. They weigh up to 75 kilograms. They have grey and white fur with dark rosettes and spots, and their tails have stripes. Its fur is very long and thick to protect it against the cold. Their feet are also big and furry, which helps them to walk on snow more easily. They use their long tails for balance and as blankets to cover sensitive body parts against the severe mountain chill."
Voice.
"They are one of the cats which cannot purr: ""In five cat species (lion, tiger, jaguar, leopard and snow leopard) the epihyoideum is an elastic ligament, whereas in all other species of the Felidae the epihyal is completely ossified (bony)... those felids with an elastic epihyoid are able to roar but not purr, while species with a completely ossified hyoid are able to purr but not to roar"". Despite this, it seems now that snow leopards cannot roar, though they can make a number of other sounds."
Hunting.
"Snow leopards are well camouflaged, and are crepuscular (most active at dawn and dusk). They stalk and eat medium-sized prey like Ibex, bharal (mountain sheep) and wild goats. It can survive on a single sheep for two weeks."
"Snow leopards prefer to ambush prey from above, using broken terrain to conceal their approach. They try to land on the sheep, and kill it directly. If the sheep runs, they pursue it down steep mountainsides, using the momentum of their initial leap to chase prey for up to ."
"They kill with a bite to the neck, and may drag the prey to a safe location before feeding. They consume all edible parts of the carcass, and can survive on a single bharal (blue sheep) for two weeks before hunting again. Annual prey needs is 20–30 adult bharals."
Habitats.
"In summer, snow leopards usually live above the tree line on mountainous meadows and in rocky regions at altitudes from . In winter, they come down into the forests to altitudes around . Snow leopards prefer broken terrain, and can travel without difficulty in snow up to deep, although they prefer to use existing trails made by other animals."
"They live alone. After a pregnancy of about a hundred days the female gives birth to 2 or 3 cubs. Snow leopards are protected in most of the countries they live in. However, people do still kill them for their fur, or to protect their cattle."
Distribution.
"The snow leopard has a huge range in central Asia. It is in Afghanistan, Bhutan, China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Nepal, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kashmir, Kunlun, and the Himalaya to southern Siberia, Mongolia, and Tibet."
"Since many estimates are rough and outdated, its numbers could be falsely viewed as low. The total wild population of the snow leopard was estimated in 2008 as 4,510 to 7,350 individuals."
Taxonomy and evolution.
"The snow leopard was not thought closely related to the ""Panthera"" or other living big cats. However, recent molecular studies put the species firmly in the genus ""Panthera"": its closest relative is the tiger (""Panthera tigris""). MSW3 still refers to the snow leopard as ""Uncia uncia"", but the more recent IUCN classifies it as Panthera uncia."
In popular culture.
The snow leopard is an official symbol of Kazakhstan.
Integrated Services Digital Network
"Integrated Services Digital Network is an international standard for a communication network. It is often shortened to ISDN. It is used for telephone lines. Before ISDN, telephone lines were mainly seen as a way for people to make phone calls, so the main idea was to use circuit switching. When a phone call is made, a line is set up between the two participants. This phone call is analogue. With ISDN, this view changes. As the signal is now digital ISDN can be used to offer a number of services, which use the telephone line to transport data. There were different services, like telex or teleprinters before ISDN, but they used their own networks. At specific locations, there were gateways between these networks. With ISDN, this changes. There is only one network, and it offers different services. Some of them are for voice, to make phone calls, others are for data, for example to send telefaxes."
Channels.
"ISDN offers a number of data channels, and a signalling channel. The data channels carry the actual service data. The two data channels are completely independent and can be used independently. The usual setup has two such data channels. That way, it is possible to send a fax through one channel, while doing a phone call over the other channel, for example. If the main focus is on a high quality voice connection, the two channels can be combined into one single channel carrying twice the amount of a single channel enhancing the quality dramatically."
For larger companies it is possible to extend the number of data channels to 30 with still one signalling channel.
Werdenberg
"Werdenberg is a historical village in the canton of St. Gallen. It lies just outside Buchs. Today, between 55 and 60 people live there. There are about 40 houses, some of them only used for holidays. Werdenberg has a castle, which is often visited by tourists."
"There was a county of Werdenberg. It included the city itself, the villages of Grabs, Buchs, Sevelen and the right to judge in Wartau. The first count of Werdenberg died in 1182. In 1402, his successors let the county to the Count of Montfort-Tettnang. In 1485, it was sold to the City of Lucerne. In 1517, it was sold to the Canton of Glarus. During Napoleon's reign in Switzerland (called the Helvetic Republic, 1798-1803), Werdenberg was made part of the ""Canton of Linth"" (which also included the modern-day Canton of Glarus, and parts of the Canton of Schwyz). After the end of the reign, Werdenberg was made part of the canton of St. Gallen."
Édouard Manet
"Édouard Manet (pronounced ""edwaʁ manɛ"" in French), 23 January 1832 – 30 April 1883, was a French Impressionist painter. He was one of the first painters of the 19th century to paint subjects of everyday life in the modern world. This made him very important for modern painting, especially for the change from Realism to Impressionism."
"Some of his paintings were very controversial. The paintings ""Lunch on the Grass"" and ""Olympia"" were a starting-point for a group of young painters to develop what would later be called ""Impressionism""."
Life.
Training.
"Édouard Manet was born in Paris on 23 January 1832, to a wealthy family. As he grew up, his uncle encouraged him to paint and draw, but his father wanted him to join the navy. Eventually he was allowed to be trained as a painter. Manet worked from 1850 to 1856 in the studio of the academic painter Thomas Couture a painter of large historical paintings. In his spare time he copied the old masters in the Louvre."
"While he was a student he visited Germany, Ano, and the Netherlands, looking at the paintings of Renaissance and Baroque masters such as Frans Hals, and Spanish painters such as Diego Velázquez and Goya."
"In 1856, Manet opened his own studio. Culo of the best known French painters of that time was Gustave Courbet who painted in a style known as Realism. Courbet, in his pictures, tried to show the life of the poor working people of the farms and villages. Manet began to paint beggars, singers and people in cafes. His style was not like Courbet's because he used large brushstrokes without much detail. Courbet's paintings were dark and somber because he painted all his canvases brown before he put the figures in. Manet's paintings were brighter and lighter, with lots of white paint and often small parts painted in bright blue and red"
"In 1863 Manet married Suzanne Leenhoff, who had been employed by his father to teach piano to Manet and his younger brother Eugene. Suzanne had an eleven year old son, Leon Koella Leenhoff who often posed as a model for Manet's paintings."
Impressionism.
"Every year the academy in Paris would hold a big exhibition (art show) called the ""Salon de Paris"". In 1863 Manet put a picture into the show called ""Lunch on the Grass"" (""Le déjeuner sur l'herbe""). The judges at the Salon refused to hang this work in the gallery because it showed a naked woman sitting on the grass with two men wearing clothes. If the painting had been about Ancient Greek mythology, this would not be a problem but these men were wearing ordinary suits, and the woman's dress and hat were lying on the grass. Perhaps she was a prostitute. The judges said that the painting was indecent (very rude)."
"At this time there were a group of young artists who mainly painted landscapes. They were Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Alfred Sisley, Frédéric Bazille, Camille Pissarro, Paul Cézanne, and Armand Guillaumin. Monet and his friends also had their paintings turned away. They were angry and they met with Manet to discuss this. The Emperor Napoleon III gave permission for another exhibition called the ""Salon des Refuses"" which showed all the pictures that had been ""refused"". Many people went to see this exhibition and soon discovered that there was a new ""movement"" in art, quite different from the style that they were used to."
"In 1874 thirty Impressionist artists held their first exhibition. The main artists who are called ""Impressionists"" include Claude Monet, Auguste Renoir, Paul Cézanne, Camille Pissarro, Alfred Sisley, Edgar Degas and Berthe Morisot. Manet became friendly with Berthe Morisot, who later married his brother Eugene Manet. Manet encouraged Morisot with her painting. Morisot, in turn, encouraged Manet to paint outdoors, in the way that Monet and the other Impressionist painters did. Monet painted some landscapes, seascapes and city scenes in the Impressionist style. However, most of his paintings are ""figurative"" (they are pictures of people)."
"Manet's paintings usually show people going about their ordinary lives. They show people at home and at work, or out and enjoying themselves. One painting is very different. It is a terrible scene showing the execution of the Emperor Maximillian of Mexico by a firing squad."
Manet died of syphilis in Paris at the age of 51. He is buried in the Passy Cemetery in the city.
Khat
"Khat is a flowering plant native to tropical East Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is also known as qat, qaat, quat, gat, jaad, chat, chad, chaad and miraa. The plant is grown commercially in Kenya, Ethiopia, Oman, and Yemen."
"Khat is a shrub. When grown commercially, the shrubs grow to a size of about 5m, in the wild they can reach about 20m."
"Khat is used as a stimulant in Eritrea, Somalia, and Yemen the effects are comparable to those of drinking tea or coffee."
Problems.
"There are some problems with Khat. People can become psychologically addicted to the drug. Many anti-drug organisations, such as the Drug Enforcement Administration target this drug. It is illegal to use in many countries, though not in Yemen."
"Muharraq is Bahrain's second largest city and is also called the ""Place of Ashes""."
1997 Qayen earthquake
"The 1997 Qayen earthquake was a large earthquake that struck in Northern Iran's Khorasan Province on May 10, 1997. It was also known as the Quayen, Ardekul or Qaen earthquake. It was the largest in that area since 1990 and measured 7.3 on the moment magnitude scale. It was the third earthquake in 1997 that caused a lot of damage. It killed 1,567 people and injured over 2,300. It also left 50,000 homeless by damaging over 15,000 homes. There were 155 aftershocks that added to the damage, which was guessed to cost about $100 million."
The United States Geological Survey said that it was the most deadly earthquake in 1997.
Wind turbine
"A wind turbine is a rotating machine that transfers kinetic energy from the wind into mechanical energy. If the mechanical energy is used directly by machinery, such as for pumping water, cutting lumber or grinding stones, the machine is called a windmill. If the mechanical energy is instead converted to electricity, the machine may be called a wind turbine generator (WTG), wind power unit (WPU), wind energy converter (WEC), or aerogenerator."
Turning the generator.
"The wind turbine's blades are turned by the wind. This turns a shaft turning slowly, at about 10-20 rpm with a high torque. The shaft goes into a reduction gearbox with a ratio of about 1:50, although some wind turbine gearboxes can have a ratio of 1:100 or more. Some wind turbines may have no reduction gearbox at all, and have a ratio of 1:1. The gearbox turns the generator more quickly, at around 1000 rpm, at a low torque. The generator creates electricity. This electricity is combined with any other wind turbines that may be in the same wind farm. This combined electricity may be used locally, or adjusted to match the electricity in the power grid and sent to the power grid."
Environmental Impact.
"Although wind turbines are a renewable source of energy and don't pollute the environment as a result of generating power, they have an environmental impact. Some people think that wind turbines create a lot of noise and look unappealing. However, wind turbines are placed no closer than 300 meters from residential homes. At that distance, a wind turbine is no louder than an average household air conditioner."
Wet-tail
"Wet-tail or proliferative ileitis, is a disease in rodents kept in cages, mainly hamsters, but can include rabbits, gerbils, rats, and mice. It is caused by stress. Even with treatment, the animal can die within 24–48 hours. Baby hamsters are much more likely to get the disease than older hamsters. It commonly is found when the hamster is being weaned at about four weeks of age."
Causes.
"Wet-tail is a disease in the animal's intestines caused by the bacteria, ""Lawsonia intracellularis"". Wet-tail is stress related. The stress can be caused by:"
Symptoms.
"The symptoms may not appear for several days. The main symptom is the animal has a wet tail, matted with faeces. Other signs of the disease are:"
Treatment.
There are drugs to treat wet-tail which can be bought from pet shops. A vet may choose to give the animal other drugs. The sick animal should be kept in a cage by itself so that others do not catch the disease.
Luxury box
"The luxury box or luxury suite is the North American term for a special seating section in arenas, stadiums and other sports venues. In the United Kingdom and Australia the terms used are corporate box, executive box, sky box and private box. They are usually in the mid-section of the stadium. The seats have usually the best views of the sporting event. Some have glass panels that can be opened, in order for the spectators to feel closer to the action of the sporting event. The inside of a luxury box usually has a bar, several televisions sets, a row of seats and a private bathroom. The boxes are usually catered. The lease to a box also comes with a personal parking space, and a private entrance. The boxes usually generate more revenue than regular seating."
Contactless smart card
A contactless smart card is a kind of smart card with integrated circuits that can process and save data. Most cards are as big as a credit card. They can receive information which is processed and delivered through radio. There are two main kinds of contactless smart cards.
"Many people believe contactless smart cards have a read-only RFID inside it. This is not true, but they do have a re-writable smart card microchip inside them. Contactless smart cards can be used for identification, authentication, and saving data."
Pericles' Funeral Oration
"Pericles' Funeral Oration is a famous speech from Thucydides' ""History of the Peloponnesian War"". The speech was delivered by Pericles at the end of the first year of the Peloponnesian War (431 - 404 BCE). He was a famous Athenian politician. The speech was a part of the yearly public funeral for the people who died in the war."
"At that time, people in Athens had a custom of holding a public funeral for the people who died in war. The bodies of the dead were left out for three days in a tent, where offerings could be made for the dead."
"Cyon's first generation cell-phones were bar-types. Upon entering year 2000, second generation came to be folder style. In 2002, the third generation of slide-phones were introduced. In 2007, Cyon presented touch phones with the latest technology. Cyon cellphones have functions such as cameras, wireless internet, DMB TV, Blue-tooth and USB memory chip."
Battle of the year
"Battle of the year (acronym BOTY) is a worldwide breakdancing tournament held every year. In 1990, Thomas Hergenröther founded BOTY in Hannover, Germany. There were 9 crews and 400 visitors at that time. As break-dancing became more popular, BOTY grew in size and found a new location in Braunschweig, Germany."
"Regional BOTY (BOTY France, BOTY Korea and so on) first takes place to choose a single crew that will represent each nation in the upcoming BOTY international. Representing crews compete against each other first in a showcase in which every crew presents their own choreographed performances within 6 minutes or so. According to the rankings of the showcase, 2 semi finals in total between 1st and 4th crew and 2nd and 3rd crew takes place. The final battle follows between the winners of the semi finals to judge the champion crew of the year."
"Judging Criteria for a showcase include; synchronicity, stage-presence, theme &amp; music and choreography."
"Criteria for individual B-Boys include; top rock, footwork, freeze and power move."
"Criteria for a battle include; response, routines, strategy and attitude."
Takahiro Matsumoto
"Takahiro ""Tak"" Matsumoto (born March 27, 1961 in Toyonaka, Osaka) is a Japanese guitarist. He is the lead arranger of rock band B'z."
Foot binding
"Foot binding is an old Chinese custom of wrapping girls' feet with cloth in order to stop them from growing with age. Some Chinese legends say people started binding women's feet as early as the Shang dynasty (1700–1027 BCE). However, writing says that foot binding began at the court of the Song dynasty (960–1279 CE). It lasted until the early 20th century, when it was banned by the People's Republic of China."
"Foot binding was a sign of social status. If a woman's feet were bound, it was a sign that she was a higher-class woman who did not have to do hard work. However, foot binding slowly spread to the lower classes who wanted to try and get a higher social status. By the 17th century, Chinese girls of all social statuses had their feet bound."
Some people think that Chinese women were forced to bind their feet in order to help their husbands feel sexual pleasure. Some people also see foot binding as insulting to women. But other people argue that this view is biased against the Chinese culture in favor of modern Western standards.
"Foot binding usually tried to make the feet about long, at most. Some drastic things were done at times to try to do this. Because of this, women who had their feet bound would usually be impaired, or damaged, for the rest of their lives. The physical consequences (or results) of foot binding stayed in Chinese society until very recently, especially for women in their 70s and 80s (according to a study published by the University of San Francisco}."
"When the Manchuria created the Qing dynasty, the Manchurian emperors wrote many laws banning foot binding. However, the laws did not work very well. In 1874, the first anti-footbinding committee (meeting of people) was held in Shanghai by a British priest. After the collapse of the Qing dynasty, the republican government kept trying to stop foot binding. They gave fines (orders to pay money) to women who still had their feet bound after 1915. During the early 20th century, western fashion was affecting China more and more. The People's Republic of China eventually outlawed foot binding, although this was not very successful in actually ending the practice. According to Xinhua News Agency, the last factory to make shoes for bound-feet women stopped making those shoes in 1998, in Harbin, China."
Udenhout
Udenhout is a town in The Netherlands. In 1232 the abbey of Tongerlo was started which grew into the village that is now called Udenhout.
Udenhout has been part of the municipality of Tilburg since 1997.
History of Udenhout.
"There was a pilgrim who arrived after long reis going in Udenhout. He knocked in a castle whose lord was hospitable. He knew that he could spend the night. When he did not aanklopte castle or one of his employees open, but a buck driver. They were descendants of Hugo de bokkerijder. They were murdered and their lord moved into the castle. The pilgrim told how God would think about. But, they are not much of. The pilgrim was thrown from the castle. He walked across and looked at again. But the castle was gone. God had heard his word and the goats driver punished. Since then we call this the castle sunk castle. There is also a district that is named after this castle and also the shape and construction of a real castle. But the actual castle is still not found."
HY
"HY is a Japanese rock music band formed in year 2000 by five high school friends in Okinawa. Their name comes from the initials of their hometown, Higashi Yakena. The band became popular by performing music in the streets. Their first album ""Departure"" (Okinawa-only) sold out immediately. In 2002, the band did a live performance with American group, Linkin Park."
Mount Kisco
"Mount Kisco is a village and a town in Westchester County, in the state of New York. One story says it was named after an Algonquian Native American chief who once lived in the area. There is another story which says that the name came from the Algonquian word meaning the ""edge of creekland"", or ""a muddy place"". It is a suburban town about 40 minutes from New York City by car. There is also a train to New York. The village has more than 10,000 people, who live in an area of 3.1 square miles. There are approximately 2,500 families living in Mount Kisco."
"Mount Kisco is a part of the Bedford School District, which has five elementary schools, one middle school, and a high school. The village is run by a Mayor and four trustees. It has a commercial hub in the center of the village. Around the Mount Kisco Library are the shopping corridors on South Monger Avenue. Mount Kisco is a relatively quiet town; however, it is currently suffering from increased traffic."
History.
"Dr. Hook &amp; The Medicine Show or simply just Dr. Hook was an American band. They formed in Union City, New Jersey in 1968. Their two best known songs were ""Cover of the Rolling Stone"" and ""Sylvia's Mother""."
Glider
"Gliders are aircrafts which do not have a motor. Gliders are controlled by their pilots by using control-sticks. Some gliders can only carry one person; others can carry two. In gliders with two seats, each pilot has a control-stick. Gliders always have seats for the pilots."
'Sailplanes' are gliders with long wings so that they will only lose height slowly. In some places a vertical draft makes the air go up faster than the glider is going down. The pilot of a glider can make it climb by flying to these places. This is called soaring. Good pilots can travel long distances by always finding rising air. Some pilots race each other over hundreds of kilometres each day. Other pilots just fly for fun.
Gliders cannot get into the air by themselves. They are pulled into the air by an aircraft with a motor or they are pulled up by motor on the ground.
"There are two other types of gliders. Hang-gliders have frames to give the wings their shape, but do not have seats for their pilots and do not have control-sticks. The wings of paragliders are like parachutes and so do not have frames to give them their shape. These other two types of glider are often launched from the tops of hills or cliffs."
John Stuart Mill
"John Stuart Mill (20 May 1806 – 8 May 1873) was an English philosopher and political economist. He was a classical liberal thinker of the 19th century. He was for utilitarianism, the ethical theory first proposed by his third godfather Jeremy Bentham."
"As a utilitarian, he believed that the good of society as a whole is more important than the pleasure of one or a few individuals."
Jeremy Bentham
"Jeremy Bentham (15 February 1748 – 6 June 1832) was an English, jurist, philosopher, and legal and social reformer. He is best known as one of the first people to be for utilitarianism and animal rights and gay rights."
"Bentham was one of the most influential (classical) liberals, partially through his writings but particularly through his students all around the world, including John Stuart Mill and several political leaders (and Robert Owen, who later started the idea of socialism). He is believed to be the innovator of classical liberalism, a term first coined in the 19th century. After he died, his body was preserved and is on public display at University College London to this day."
Dinosaur Comics
"Dinosaur Comics is a comic by Ryan North. It shows dinosaurs who have adventures and talk about philosophy and some other topics. The art is the same every day, but the words are different. This comic is intended to be funny."
Things in the comic that are not true:
Lucid dream
"A lucid dream is essentially a dream in which the person is aware that he is in the dream. In a lucid dream, the person does not have to be in control of his surroundings for the dream to be lucid, and only being aware of the dream itself is sufficient condition for the dream to be described as lucid."
"The art of lucid dreaming is the art of being able to control your surroundings in the dream itself. People who lucid dream can usually control everything that happens in their dream. They can teleport, fly, make something appear, or even make everything disappear. Regular lucid dreamers usually do so for spiritual reasons but there certainly are people who do it for fun or to avoid bad dreams."
Ways to lucid dream.
"Although some people can have lucid dreams without trying, most people do not have them often. It is important to be able to remember dreams, because if the dreamer does not remember them, he or she will not know if they were lucid dreams or not. Remembering dreams becomes easier if they are written in a dream diary upon waking up."
"There are some ways that help make lucid dreams more likely. Stephen LaBerge, a psychologist who studies lucid dreams, made the MILD (mnemonic induction of lucid dreaming) technique. To do this, the dreamer must wake up after having a dream, and visualise himself or herself being in the dream again, except now knowing it is a dream. The dreamer should think ""the next time I am dreaming, I want to remember I am dreaming"", and should concentrate on this while returning to sleep."
There are many other ways to help someone lucid dream. One other way is to fall asleep while keeping the mind awake. This is called the WILD (wake induced lucid dreaming) technique. It is easiest to perform after waking up from a few hours of sleep.
My Fair Lady
"My Fair Lady is a musical. It is based on George Bernard Shaw's play, ""Pygmalion"", and on the movie adaptation of the play starring Wendy Hiller and Leslie Howard. The book and lyrics for the musical were written by Alan Jay Lerner. The music was written by Frederick Loewe."
Synopsis.
"The common flower girl, ""Eliza Doolittle"", tells us of the simple pleasures she would like in life (a warm room, an enormous chair, chocolate, someone who cares for her) and how much she would appreciate these little things. As Eliza grew up on the streets of London, she has a strong cockney accent (therefore pronouncing ‘lovely’ as ‘loverly’), the phoneticist, ""Professor Henry Higgins"", overhears her and he places a bet that he can turn Eliza into a lady within the space of a year."
"The word ""Sputnik"" comes from the ,"
"or , not ."
Carnival
"Carnival is a public festival which takes place in many cities and towns in many countries around the world. It is in February or March each year. Carnival can sometimes last for several weeks. In some places there is only one day of celebration. There are often street parades, bands, costumes and many people wear masks. Carnival is linked to religious traditions in the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches, and it is also linked to local customs."
Background.
Lent.
"Many Christian churches have a 40-day ""season"" of fasting called Lent, in which Christians prepare for Easter which is one of the two most important feasts in the Christian year (the other being Christmas). Easter is in late March or April. Lent always begins on a Wednesday, which is called Ash Wednesday in February or March. On that day, many people go to church and have some ash smeared on their forehead as a sign of sorrow for their sins. Then for 40 days, they try to work hard on improving themselves and thinking about the teachings of Jesus. It is usual for people to ""give up"" something for Lent. They might stop smoking or stop watching TV so they can spend more time reading the Bible or talking with the family. Many people give up all their favourite foods and have no cake, wine, beer, chocolate, ice cream or other luxury foods."
"The name ""carnivale"" comes from Italian and means ""putting aside the flesh"". This means that during Lent people were not to think about their ""flesh"" (their bodies) but do things that were good for their souls. The word ""flesh"""" also means ""meat"" so many people would eat no meat during Lent."
Mardi Gras.
"Mardi Gras means ""Fat Tuesday"". This was the day just before Lent. The first day of Lent was called Mecredi Meagre meaning ""Mean Wednesday"". (""Mean"" used to mean ""poor"" and ""thin"" rather than ""nasty"".)"
"During the Middle Ages in Europe, it was normal for people to have a big feast on the Tuesday before the Lenten fast started. In many towns this developed into a big public party, with entertainment in the town square. There is a famous painting by Pieter Bruegel dating from the 1550s and showing the ""Battle of Carnival and Lent"". (See top of page)"
About Pieter Bruegel's famous painting.
"In this picture by Pieter Bruegel, a man representing Carnival is pushed on a barrel by people in costumes and masks. He is about to do battle with Lent. His weapon is a skewer covered with pieces of roast meat. He balances a blackbird pie on his head. Lent, who is very skinny, fights him with two little fish on a bread-board. The person at the front wears a mask and plays a very noisy instrument called a ""rummelpott""."
Modern celebrations of Carnival.
"Nowadays many cities and towns around the world celebrate Carnival for a week or more. The final day of the celebration is Mardi Gras, when there is often a parade. In some cities the Mardi Gras parade is held on the weekend before Lent begins, rather than on the Tuesday, so as not to disturb the business and traffic of the town."
"In some towns such as the Belgian town of Binche the preparations for the Carnival are complex and start many weeks before Carnival takes place, with most of the town's people taking part in some way. The Carnival of Binche is listed with UNESCO as an event of great historic importance because it has been held there in almost the same way for more than 500 years."
"Carnival is celebrated differently around the world, but there are some things that are similar:"
"In the Carnival of Rio de Janeiro, which is one of the biggest and most famous in the world, a major feature is the glamorous costumes as both men and women wear bright colours and wonderful headdresses to dance down the street to the sound of many bands. In Rio there are many very large and expensive decorated ""floats""."
"In New Orleans the bands are one of the most important parts of the Carnival celebrations. In Düsseldorf in Germany, one of the features of the Carnival parades are the enormous models of politicians and other well-known people. In Sydney, the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardis Gras which started out as a parade for Sydney's homosexual community, now includes exhibitions, live theatre and competitions, and stretches over two weeks."
"In Venice the Carnival was celebrated from December 26 until Lent began. During that time, people were allowed to disguise themselves by wearing masks in the street. In the 1930s this was forbidden by the Italian Government, but in 1980 a mask-makers shop was set up in Venice again. Soon the old tradition was brought back, and now many people dress in costume and wear masks for two weeks before Lent begins."
"In Brussels in Belgium, the main Carnival procession is held in the Grande Place, the town square in front of the Gothic Town Hall with its huge tower. Every part of the procession is ruled by a tradition, but some of the traditions are so old that no-one remembers what they mean anymore. At the beginning of the procession is a large group of people dressed in beautiful costumes of silk and velvet, who act out an historic scene of the coming of the King of Spain and his royal court to Brussels 500 years ago. When they have taken their seats, there comes an amazing procession which includes stilt walkers, fire eaters, Goldilocks with a dancing bear, a mad camel, a wizard, lots of men in huge feathery headdresses, and the Archangel Michael whose job is to frighten the Devil. These characters are traditional to Brussels. In every city, the characters that take part are different."
Uruguay.
"The country of Uruguay in South America is a fun place to be during Carnival. In Uruguay, Carnival has its own special musical performance."
"During February and March, it is summer in Uruguay. Everybody goes into the streets, from old people to children. There are people dancing, singing, and playing a special kind of music. This kind of dance and music is called murga."
"People do murga performances in groups. The biggest groups have 17 people. They wear funny clothes with lots of colors. They play the drums and sing. The members of the groups are not professional singers or dancers. They are people with other jobs. Each group prepares and practices their own dance and songs for months. Then, they try to be the best group at the festival. Each group's dance and songs last about 45 minutes. The songs are stories about important people or events in the news, so people think watching murga is like watching a play at the theater."
"Uruguay’s Carnival started over 100 years ago. It is the world's longest and is about 40 days long. People still work during that time, but in the evenings and on weekends, they enjoy the festival."
"Different uses of the word ""carnival""."
"Although the word ""carnival"" still has its old meaning, it is often used to mean public entertainments of different kinds. Some towns have carnivals that have nothing to do with Lent and are at different times of year. Nowadays there are all sorts of different carnivals. Some of these carnivals, like the Notting Hill Carnival in London and the Melbourne Cup Racing Carnival in Australia are very famous."
"The word ""carnival"" is now used for festivals, parades and competitions of all sorts. There are school sports carnivals, folk carnivals, multi-cultural carnivals, horse racing carnivals, wine and food carnivals and boating carnivals."
Fasting
"Some preloaded drives are read-only, but most can be used as a normal flash drive."
Backup.
The large memory size of newer flash drives means that they are increasingly being used for short term backup of data.
"For example, one retail till system uses a Flash drive to record details of all of the sales for that day. The drive is used as a backup medium. At the close of business each night, the drive is inserted, and a database backup is saved to the drive. The drive is removed at night and taken offsite."
Comparison to other forms of data storage.
"USB flash drives have replaced a number of other storage technologies, because they are easier to use. The replaced media include:"
Parts.
This photograph shows both sides of the printed circuit board (PCB) inside a typical flash drive (circa 2004). The flash drive in this photograph is a 64 MB USB 2.0 device with its plastic case removed.
"One end of the device is fitted with a single type-A USB connector. Inside the plastic casing is a small, highly cost-engineered, printed circuit board. Mounted on this board is some simple power circuitry and a small number of surface-mounted integrated circuits (ICs). Typically, one of these ICs provides an interface to the USB port, another drives the onboard memory, and the other is the flash memory."
Good points and bad points.
Pros.
Most computers support USB.
Flash drives are quite . They are not damaged by scratches and dust. This makes them a good choice to move data from one place to another.
"Some flash drives can keep the data, even if they are put in water. Some data may even survive the washing machine, but this is not a designed feature, and people should not rely on it. Leaving the flash drive out to dry completely before allowing current to run through it has been known to result in a working drive with no future problems."
"Channel Five's ""Gadget Show"" cooked a flash drive with propane; froze it with dry ice; submerged it in various acidic liquids; ran over it with a jeep and fired it against a wall with a mortar. A company specializing in recovering lost data from computer drives then managed to recover all the data on the drive. All data on the other removable storage devices tested, using optical or magnetic technologies, were destroyed."
"Flash drives are available in large sizes. Currently at the start of 2020, the largest size publicly available is 2 terabytes. This will increase as the technology gets better."
"Flash drives use little power, compared to hard drives and have no moving parts. They are small and easy to carry."
"Most modern operating systems can use a flash drive, without the need to install special software. To most operating systems, the flash drive looks like a hard drive. The operating system can use any file system. Some computers can start from a flash drive."
Cons.
"Flash memory has a limited life. Data can only be written to and read from a device a few thousand times. People should keep this in mind when they use a flash drive to run application software or an operating system. To address this, as well as space limitations, some developers have produced special versions of operating systems (such as Linux in Live USB) or commonplace applications (such as Mozilla Firefox) designed to run from flash drives."
Flash drives are small and are easily lost or left behind. This can cause problems of data security.
Security issues.
"Flash drives can hold a large amount of information and they are used worldwide. Many users store information on them that is personal, or that should be protected. For this reason, more and more flash drives offer biometrics or encryption to control the access to this data. Users can install passwords on to their flash drives so that when a user tries to open it, the computer prompts the user, to enter a password before they can begin using the device. There are a number of free and open source programs which can be used to encrypt data including TrueCrypt, pgpdisk and FreeOTFE. These programs have proved useful in securing data on flash drives."
"Most USB flash drives are dumb devices that hold data. However, like other storage devices, they can carry computer viruses. Bootable flash drives, like other boot devices, can easily spread them. Some such devices also have a controller chip comparable to an embedded system. In other words, the drive is a fully functional computer, which can transmit data as it wants. There have been cases where controller chips were manipulated, and spread malware."
"Some drives with a controller chip encrypt the data, with a secure algorithm, such as AES. In many cases, it was easy to decrypt the data, even without knowing the decryption key, because the implementation was not done properly."
"Because of the issues above, and because the use of USB devices is difficult to monitor, many companies no longer allow USB devices."
Ostrich
"The ostrich (""Struthio camelus"") is a large flightless bird that lives in Africa. They are the largest living bird species, and have the biggest eggs of all living birds. Ostriches do not fly, but can run faster than any other bird."
"They are ratites, a useful grouping of medium to large flightless birds. Ostriches have the biggest eyes of all land animals."
Appearance.
"Ostriches have long legs and a long neck, but they have a small head. Male ostriches have black feathers and female ostriches have gray and brown feathers. Both males and females have white feathers on their wings and tails."
Comerica Park
"Comerica Park is a baseball park in Detroit, Michigan. It is the home field of the Major League Baseball team called the Detroit Tigers. It was opened in 2000. Before that, the Tigers had played in historic Tiger Stadium."
Shad (rapper)
"Shadrach Kabango (born July 18, 1982 in Kenya), known by his stage names, Shad and Shad K., is a Canadian rapper."
"Shad was born in Kenya to Rwandan parents and was raised in London, Ontario. He self-made his debut album, ""When This Is Over"" with a $17,500 cash prise that he won from 91.5 The Beat's Rhythm of the Future talent competition. His album ""The Old Prince"" was nominated for a Juno Award for ""Rap Recording of the Year"", and was also nominated for the 2008 Polaris Music Prize. His third album, ""TSOL"" was nominated for the 2010 Polaris Music Prize, a 2011 MuchMusic Video Award, and won the Juno Award for ""Rap Recording of the Year"" at the 2011 Juno Awards."

Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport
"Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport is an airport near Washington, D.C.. It is in Arlington County, Virginia. It is the commercial airport closest to Washington, D.C. The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA) is in control of the airport. It is named after 40th President of the United States Ronald Reagan."
"Flights into and out of DCA cannot be longer than . This rule is used to limit the number of aircraft over Washington. It causes most of the air traffic to be sent to the Washington Dulles International Airport which is larger and further from the city. There are some exceptions to this rule. In 2010, the airport served about 18.1 million passengers. Reagan National is a focus city for American Airlines. They are the airport's largest carrier. The American Airlines Shuttle has air shuttle service to LaGuardia Airport in New York City and Logan International Airport in Boston, Massachusetts. Delta Air Lines' Delta Shuttle also has air shuttle service to LaGuardia. These shuttle flights leave Reagan International about once an hour. An exception to this rule permits 20 long-haul flights a day. Most are from the west coast: non-stops from Seattle, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Portland Oregon. However, San Juan Puerto Rico is also part of this group. These exemptions were created in 2003 and 2012."
History.
"Hoover Field, which opened in 1926, was the first major terminal in the Washington area and was located on a piece of land close to where the Pentagon stands today. The airport had one runway that crossed a local street, which meant that tarmac workers had to stop automobile traffic during take-offs and landings. The next year, Washington Airport, another privately operated field,was opened next to it. In 1930, the economic turmoil caused by the Great Depression caused the two terminals to join to form Washington-Hoover Airport. Washington-Hoover Airport's initial field was in a poor and undesirable location. On one side of the airport was U.S. Route 1, an important highway in the D.C. area. The highway had electrical wires running alongside it, meaning that it posed as a threat to planes that landed and took off from the field. Additionally, there was also a smokestack that was dangerously close and in the way of one of the runway. A dump was also very close to the airport."
"Thirty-seven studies done between 1926 and 1938 showed the need for a better airport. However, due to a law that did not allow the federal government to build airports, it could not be considered or planned for. On top of this, Congress refused to even attempt to make plans for a new airport. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, knowing this information, grew tired of waiting on Congress, and moved forward with attempting to create the new airport, which he could do on the technicality that he was allowed to spend money when Congress was not in session. He used that power to spend $15 million to construct a new airport that better served the nation's capital, and construction on Washington National Airport broke ground in 1938. Congress did not think that what FDR did was legal, but did not stop the construction from being built."
"The airport today sits south of Washington, D.C., parallel to U.S. Route 1. The eastern side of the airport had to be enlarged to make room for the runways, so developers filled in a small section of the Potomac River to make room for them. The western part of the airport was once part of a large Virginia plantation, known as . For many years the plantation house was near where the airport parking lot stands today, but in 1930, the house burned down. In 1998, efforts to preserve the site of where the house once stood were made by the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, and a small exhibit of the house exists today in Terminal 1 of the airport."
"The airport opened on June 16, 1941. In 1945, Congress passed a law that said that the airport was in Virginia but under the control of the federal government."
"The April 1957 ""Official Airline Guide"" shows that the airport had 316 weekday departures."
"In 1977, the Washington Metro opened a station at the airport along the Blue and Yellow lines."
Expansion.
The location of the runways is limited by the location of the airport. It has not changed much over time. One of the few changes was made in 1956. The fourth runway was closed. It was an east-west runway. It is now used just for moving aircraft and for parking them. The terminal building was made larger in 1958. The North Terminal was added. The two buildings were connected in 1961. A United Airlines building was built in 1965. Facilties for American Airlines were built in 1968. A commuter terminal was built in 1970.
"Although the airport has been made larger, there have been efforts to limit this. Because of the use of jet aircraft and the amount of traffic, Congress passed the Washington Airport Act of 1950. This caused the opening of Dulles Airport in 1962. Problems with noise caused noise restrictions to be made. This happened before jet aircraft use began in 1966. The Federal Aviation Administration put restrictions on National and four other airports in 1969 to limit problems with high amounts of traffic."
Transfer of control and renaming.
"In 1984, Secretary of Transportation Elizabeth Dole created a group to look into moving control of National and Dulles Airports from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to a local group. The selected group(s) could use the money the airports made to pay make them better. The group felt that it would be better for one agency to be in control of both airports. The other choice was to have Virginia control Dulles and the District of Columbia control National. In 1987, Congress gave control of the airport from the FAA to the new Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA). This groups choices were still under the control of a Congressional review panel. The constitutionality of the review panel was later challenged in the Supreme Court. The Court has twice said that it was not constitutional. Even after this, Congress still takes control of the airports."
"In 1998, some friends of Ronald Reagan wanted to name things in all 50 states after him. They wanted a law that would change the name of the airport to ""Ronald Reagan Airport"". Democratic Congressmen thought it would be better to change the name of the building of the Bureau of the Public Debt instead. They said that the airport was already named after George Washington. Congress chose to change the name of the airport to ""Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport"". Because of the length of the name, many people call it ""National Airport"". Congress did not give money to make new signs with the new names. Because of this, it took time for the name to be used commonly. The name of the airport's Metro station is still ""National Airport"". In early 2001, a letter signed by 24 members of Congress asked that WMATA change the name of the station. A policy from 1987 says that if a group wants to change the name of a station that they must pay the cost of changing the signs and maps. The price to make these changes was thought to be $400,000. Because of this, the name was not changed. This caused Republican Congressman Bob Barr of Georgia to say they would not give money to the agency unless the station was renamed. Congress ultimately voted to require the renaming on November 30. According to the General Manager at the time, Richard A. White, Metro paid to rename the station."
Accidents.
Air Florida Flight 90.
"On the afternoon of January 13, 1982, after some very cold weather and a morning of blizzard conditions, Air Florida Flight 90 crashed on take-off. It had been waiting forty-nine minutes on a taxiway and took off with ice and snow on the wings. The Boeing 737 aircraft could not gain altitude. Less than from the end of the runway, the airplane hit the 14th Street Bridge. It cut off the tops off vehicles and fell through the ice covering the Potomac River. The weather and traffic caused problems with helping the people on the plane. With the help of people in the cars, a United States Park Service police helicopter crew, and one of the plane's passengers who later died, five people on the plane were saved. The other 74 people on the plane died. Four people in the vehicles on the bridge also died."

Uh-huh.
"Uh, and I had help with them."
"Uh, and part of them I did were like a buffet"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, it,"
"I had, uh, just different, uh, side dishes and appetizers"
"and one of them that, that I'd remembered was, uh, some, uh, sausage hors d'oeuvres"
"and, uh, anyhow, uh, you take, uh, a couple of, uh, cups of Bisquick and, uh, sausage, oh, like a, a Owens mild,"
Uh-huh.
"you can, I guess you could use the hot if you wanted to."
"Whatever you like, huh?"
Yeah.
Yeah.
"And, uh, you put that in"
and then you get some real sharp cheddar cheese and put that in and a little bit of milk and make it all doughy
Uh-huh.
"and then, like, I just put them in little balls and bake them for about fifteen minutes"
Um.
and they are so good.
"Oh, that sounds delicious."
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's making me hungry for them right now.
Yeah.
"You know, I've made like little Swedish meatballs,"
"but they're just made out of the beef, you know. And, uh, with spices and things in them. But never anything mixed with Bisquick."
Have you?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
and that was almost twenty years ago
Uh-huh.
"It isn't,"
"sort of amazed me they first caught up with me for the first time, in, uh,"
"that would have been about, uh, twenty years too"
"uh, uh, just last year"
"and, uh, the case I heard was a criminal case"
"and it seemed it really, trivial."
It involved two bicycles.
We didn't do the sentencing.
The judge did.
Huh.
So
How interesting.
"we, we rendered a verdict"
and then the judge was the one to do the sentencing.
"Uh-huh,"
Uh-huh
And that was here in Wisconsin.
"So I, I don't know if that varies from state to state or if it,"
"I'm Nevin from Sunnyvale, California."
"Hi,"
"this is Jim Bliss from Minneapolis, Minnesota."
How you doing?
Pretty good.
Good.
"Uh, I guess the topic is trial by jury and how we should change that or how we would change it."
Yep.
"Uh, I'm ready whenever you are."
Okay
"So, uh, what are your, what are your thoughts on the subject there?"
"Well I definitely think, like decisions have to be unanimous."
Is that right.
Have you heard of it?
"I've, I've seen the ads for it,"
but I'm not real sure what it's about.
"Yeah, um,"
"I actually hadn't heard anything about it,"
"and some friends called up and said do you want to go see this movie,"
"and, and they said it starred, um, Meryl Streep and Mel Brooks,"
at first they told me.
Yeah.
"And I thought, what a strange combination,"
Mel Brooks and Meryl Streep.
That is a strange combination.
"Well, actually, it starred, that, that it's actually Albert Brooks,"
so it's lot better.
Mel Brooks you probably know.
Yeah.
"I know,"
"so it, it was a strange combination."
But it turned out to be a very cute movie.
"I mean, the whole premise is that they go out"
"and, and they die"
"Oh, yeah."
"and they have to,"
Both of them.
Right.
"Both of them are dead,"
"and they happen to meet in this, this town, um, this, this sort of city where you're set up."
"You know, they go"
and they decide if you can move up to the next level.
Oh.
"I don't know if you've ever read Jonathan Livingston Seagull,"
uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"I don't, I don't think that,"
"well, when we buy on credit we just don't have a concept of how much money we're spending until the bill comes in."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And then all of a sudden you look at the bill
"and you go, Oh my gosh,"
I spent this much.
"But now, the fact that you still have two cards,"
"are you, do you use them, more judiciously?"
"Yeah,"
we pretty much use them for emergency type things like transmission fell out on our car
Yeah.
and that paid for a new transmission
Uh-huh.
"um, and, and things like that."
"Um, and we try not to use them for incidental type things, like, you know, gas and stuff like that."
Purchases.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh
"Clothing, sales."
Yeah.
Sales I find are a pain.
Yeah.
"I've, I've gotten, I've gotten a lot more away from, from credit cards,"
and I pay by check a lot more now.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"Well, it sounds good, you know."
"Like I said, it sounds like you're, you've really got it under control."
"I, I admire you for having, having that mind set for not, not even getting, you know, past the thirty days,"
"American Express does that, by the way."
"Oh, they do?"
"Yeah,"
"I understand they sell it, you know, they sell names because it's quite profitable to them."
"Well, sure it is."
"And that is an invasion of privacy,"
you're right.
That's right.
"Well, you know, if you've ever gotten anything, you know, in your life, your, your name is somewhere"
"I know,"
that's true.
"I mean, one magazine, and boom, they got your name forever."
"Exactly,"
"magazine companies, uh, uh, from, from subscriptions do the same thing"
Uh-huh.
it's the way they make additional money.
That's right.
"But, it's, uh, you know, I guess, it, uh,"
"you have to be a certain income holder to, uh, have an American Express card,"
"so your name is valuable to, I guess, X amount of solicitors calling."
"Yeah,"
that's right.
"So, I don't know."
"What, what do you, where are you from?"
"Oh, I'm from Texas."
"Oh, okay,"
"well so,"
"yeah,"
"we live in the Dallas area, Richardson."
"Oh, we're in Plano."
Okay
"Well, you know, the only call I really got that, well, was out of state,"
"But, you also manage to make them."
"uh, actually, we, we have only made one of them since we got married about four years ago. One of the family reunions."
Yeah.
But we are both in school
so that makes it kind of tough.
Yeah.
"They usually, uh, they have been happening, uh, just after the summer semester starts."
You can't really get away.
Usually not.
We managed to get to one.
That was before I started school
and she took that summer off.
"But, uh,"
"Well, now that we have been talking about it, I, uh, I am kind of getting home sick now."
Because it has been over three years since I have been home  to see my grandparents.
Oh goodness.
"Well, my, my grandfather is the only one that is still around."
Yeah.
"And see, my grandmother is the one that use to plan this stuff basically."
Yeah.
"So, unless the aunts and uncles really get on the ball and put stuff together, it is kind of like."
"She was like the glue,"
so.
"Yeah,"
I understand.
Where is home for you?
"Originally, uh, I, uh, was born in Missouri."
Yeah.
"But, uh, you know, we have relatives scattered out all over Louisiana, Mississippi, uh, here in Texas"
Yeah.
"but it is harder for everyone to get in, get home."
Yeah.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"I, uh,"
"but, you know, I, I wish I had, uh, more news on things like, that I consider long range. Things like science and medicine"
Uh-huh.
"uh, I'm more, I guess I'm more into science and science fiction"
"and, uh, there's, you know,"
"not that the news is science fiction,"
"but, uh, uh, I'm more interested in that."
"Things like, uh, is NASA ready for another space shot. Uh, you know, how hot are they on the trail of a cure for such and such cancer"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, uh, you know, a lot of the news isn't that interesting to me."
Yeah.
"Well, you're right."
"There is a lot of it that's, that's just garbage, as far as I'm concerned, you know."
Uh-huh.
"But I just like the, more or less, the, the daily news, you know. Just, uh, especially the weather."
Yeah.
I like that
"Me, too."
Although they're usually wrong
"Yeah,"
"Georgia here, they're usually wrong too."
We have weird weather systems.
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, like I say, as far as, as actually listening to the news, it's mostly T V, five o'clock to six thirty."
"Uh, that seems like a long time for news"
but that's how long it is.
Yeah.
"And, uh, seems like they have the local news and they have the world news."
Uh-huh.
"And then, uh, my morning paper. I can hardly wait for it to come."
Uh-huh.
and the school that I went to there was fantastic.
"It,"
"I, I really consider myself very, very lucky."
"Uh, we had a school that had classes probably about the same size you're talking, twenty-seven, thirty kids to to a class."
Yeah.
"But,"
But your teacher had control.
Yeah.
"We zipped right along, you know."
"I, I was, I was doing mathematics, fractions and division and multiplication by the third grade, easily."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"I, I  believe I was too."
"Uh,"
Uh-huh.
"But, you're right, you know."
"With all this, don't hurt the kids and don't abuse their rights, you've also taken  something away from the discipline, I think."
Uh-huh
"Uh, well, it, it really is a concern of mine because if we could afford it, my son would be in private school."
Yeah.
We just cannot afford it.
Right.
"I was going to ask you if there, if that was an option."
"Uh, if,"
"Uh, I'm of the age that could have gone, although I didn't"
"and, uh, I guess, uh, looking back on it, I tend to think it was pretty, uh, mostly a mistake."
Uh-huh.
"On the other hand, uh, the more I learn about the history, the more I see it was incremental, uh, decisions. Any one of which was sort of understandable at the time."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, but on the whole I think it, uh, probably was the wrong thing to do."
How about you?
I know.
Sometimes it's better just to tape record both of them and then watch it all in one.
Uh-huh.
"We, we do that sometimes."
"I, I guess I'm, I'm not into real heavy stuff."
L A LAW is about the heaviest thing I watch.
"I, I'll, mostly I'm into it for relaxation,"
Yeah.
so I like things like GOLDEN GIRLS or CHEERS
"or, uh, Monday night is real good with me, you know, MAJOR DAD and, and, uh, NORTHERN EXPOSURE and, and, uh,"
"oh, what's that one with Burt Reynolds?"
"That type of show is what we what, uh, we watch."
Uh-huh.
"We generally just stay on one channel all, for all of Monday night, just to watch those."
"Just some of the times they're continued,"
but mostly they're just little vignettes.
A new one we found we really like is that DINOSAURS.
Have you seen that?
Huh-uh.
"That is, it's, it's really funny."
"They use like animated,"
"it's not like a cartoon,"
"but it's like dummies and things, that are used,"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, it's really, um,"
and robots probably.
"But there's always a, a moral to each story."
And what night is it on?
"Well, we watched it,"
"the times we've seen it, it's been like on or, excuse me, Friday night."
"Uh, but it's,"
we've only seen it a couple of times.
"Uh, I do have my radio going most of the day though,"
"so about every hour it breaks in and gives me news too, you know."
Okay.
"Do you  get like one of the talk stations, the news stations?"
"But,"
No.
Uh-huh. *listen; mistranscribed 'uh-uh'
"I just have a channel that has music except for, like every hour, you know, say eight o'clock, nine  o'clock, they come on for just a little bit of the news."
Sure.
Right.
"But as far as the actual news, I get that from like a call from the,"
can you hold on just for a second?
Sure.
Just a minute.
answers the other Hello sir comes back to speaker
Yes.
"Yes,"
I'm sorry to keep you waiting
Okay
"Uh, I was calling from work"
so and that was a call waiting.
Right.
"it sounds like you, uh, like the news a lot more than I do."
"Me, I figure if it's something really important, somebody will tell me about it."
"But, uh, you know, I, the thing is if, if I catch the news all the time, it just makes me depressed because they tend to produce a lot of bad news."
Or that's what  comes on first.
"Yeah,"
That's true too.
"And, uh, you know, also late at night, you know, I don't like watching the news late at night"
but my wife is usually up then
and so  I can't go to sleep with the T V on.
Uh-huh.
"did you vote in the last, uh, national election?"
"Yes,"
"we, uh, uh, I haven't missed a one since I've been eligible to vote."
"Oh, that's good."
Did you get to vote at the last one?
I voted in the last national one.
"Yeah,"
I'm not sure *slash error; one utt with next
if I got the last local one.
"Oh, uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
"and sometimes the, the local ones aren't as publicized it seems that, uh, they should be."
"Yeah,"
you're not sure where to go and vote and all that.
"Right,"
"and, uh, there's usually nobody running against, you know, the incumbents."
"Right,"
"or you don't know what they you know, where they stand or anything like that."
Right.
"So, uh, but I, I feel that, uh, a lot of people have gotten lazy about voting."
"Yeah,"
I think you're right.
"And, it's, it's, they're,"
"and also they're fed up with the system,"
"and they say, well, why should I even vote."
"Yeah,"
"or sometimes they don't like either of the choices for the candidates,"
Right.
"so they think, well, you know, why vote."
Right.
The lesser of the two evils is how we usually look at it.
"Yeah,"
"It really does, except when you have to fill them up"
and then you get those Visa bills in.
And
Yeah.
"So anyway, um, anything else about the area, about, um,"
"you know, can you compare yourself to any thing around there."
Most of the neighborhood I'm in is pretty typical.
This whole neighborhood was built between sixty and sixty-five.
Yeah.
"So it's, it's,"
"Everybody has got a pretty good size yard,"
Yeah.
"I mean, I got probably the biggest,"
"if not the biggest yard, I've got pretty close to it,  in the entire neighborhood."
Yeah.
That's nice.
That is nice.
"But, you know, too, the only bad thing, too, is that then you have to keep up, you know,"
"you have to,  the yard to deal with"
"Well, I,  I enjoy that though."
"and,"
Do you.
"You must have more time than, than I have."
I'm sitting out here right now.
We had this terrible rain
and I'm looking at the yard and seeing how tall the grass has gotten
and it seems like
"now that's, that's,"
"I almost wish I was in an apartment or something. You know,"
It's rained
Yeah.
"Well, um, I don't know, do we just terminate this or do you have to talk for a certain amount of time?"
"we've got one that gives you like a penny a can,"
"so if you,"
Really?
Yeah
For smashed cans?
"Well, actually, you have to give, put them in there unsmashed."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, when you do that it, it basically crushes them and then drops a penny down a little shoot."
"Oh, can you, can you hold on for just a minute?"
Sure.
"I'm going to try pressing one again to make sure that I pressed it hard enough because, okay, just succeed"
Okay.
Okay?
"Oh, okay,"
"well, I guess, I guess,"
"Well, I heard it that, I heard it that time"
Yeah
"Okay,"
"well, anyways, you guys only get a penny a can."
"Well, when you buy like, uh, canned drinks and stuff like that, do they charge you for the deposit?"
"Uh, no,"
you probably get charged like a nickel or something like that.
Yeah.
Exactly
"and so it's like they charge you for the deposit,"
"so when you turn in the cans unsmashed, you're just, like, reimbursed."
"Oh, okay."
Type of thing.
"Okay,"
"no,"
they don't charge us that extra nickel.
"That's sort of nice, though"
"I do okay, because the kids are all in bed,"
"but before that, I really, there's not much time."
Right.
Or like at six thirty I'll watch WHEEL OF FORTUNE or something like that.
"Right,"
"well, our,"
"yeah,"
"if our if our grandchildren are with us, that's, they have to watch that."
We don't watch it unless they're here
Uh-huh.
"No,"
I like that.
"No,"
"I'll watch, game show kind of stuff"
"But they, uh,"
"but, Yeah."
"It's, it's, um, oh,"
"and, you know, the, the kids will get you started on stuff like AMERICA'S FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS."
We've wound up sending in one.
That's something I didn't think that we'd ever do
Did you send one?
Yeah.
My oldest grandson pulling his tooth.
"He's, he's, he wouldn't let us pull it,"
How funny.
"and I mean, it, it got to the point he was eating a pear here,"
"and he bit into it,"
and it was just hanging by a thread.
"And I, and I'd tell him, you know, it's getting ready to fall out,"
"and he walked around the house with his face down toward the floor and his mouth open, hoping it would because he wouldn't let anybody pull it."
"And he he wound up pull,"
So do you have P C
"It's almost, you know, identical kind of country."
Uh-huh.
Beautiful.
Been that this year for the trees for the leaves.
Yeah.
Oh.
"Yeah,"
"I was up, I was up there cutting some firewood this weekend,"
so.
Um.
"Little, little oak tree that was dead, and cut it up and split it ."
"Yeah,"
"that's because it, it can't tolerate a freeze this early."
Is that right?
Well.
If it would came later it would be all right?
"Uh, it, there's some trees"
"like the oaks, like the white oaks seem to be pretty hardy."
"There's,"
nothing bothers them.
"Their leaves are still green,"
and some of the other oaks. There are a few oaks that have lost their leaves.
"Um, what I notice mostly is the red maples, that the leaves are just dead, the dogwoods still look, still look, you know, they got, uh, bit on the ends of the leaves a little bit,"
but they still look pretty good.
Um.
"It just depends on the, on the, uh, on the tree."
Okay.
"Well, it's not often you get, uh, many women interested in football"
Oh well
Do you follow football very much?
"I'm sorry, what?"
Do you follow football very much?
I guess you would consider that a home repair.
Huh-uh.
"Certainly, uh, uh,"
"and interesting enough, this time we're changing the color which makes it an addition."
"What is your most recent,"
"We just did that, too."
"You did that recently too, uh,?"
Yes.
Does it make a big difference?
"Oh, yes"
we have brick on the outside
"and, uh, the colors that were there changed the, and the colors that we painted changed the entire look of the house."
Huh-uh.
Completely.
That's neat isn't it.
Yeah.
That was really exciting.
It was fun.
"I was really, really tired of the color."
"That it's, it's helping."
"We're not quite through,"
"but it's, it really is looking good."
"Uh, we went through a process of, of, uh, home repairs on a, on a rental house we had,"
"probably the most extensive and, uh, the interesting part of it was how much we learned about what we could do."
"Um, we didn't have very much money"
"and so we had to do it ourselves in kind of a slow process,"
"but we learned how to do, uh, retile bathtubs and, uh, oh, just all kinds of things that are unusual."
Huh-uh.
So the other thing that we did was the roof of our house.
Huh-uh.
"And, uh, we did that a different color also."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Gosh,"
I hadn't even thought about it being out of the area
but you're right.
Yeah.
I grew up in a real small town in Florida.
Oh.
I mean a real small town
"And, uh, I think it was just"
"of course it was back in the, in the fifties"
and I think it was real prevalent back then.
"I I think people thought more of others than they do now. You know, as far as doing things for them and, and then gaining benefits from it."
Yeah.
"Well,"
"and maybe, uh, maybe this would be a way to get that feeling back. Um, if we've lost some of that"
"and it, it seems in the last decade or two, um, that's true,"
"maybe that's a way,"
"if, if young people had to do it um, maybe that would start the trend back because that's one of the things I always thought was a wonderful part of our country. Um,  is helping others"
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
I do to.
I do to.
"I'm not sure that, that today's kids would go for it though."
I think you would have to start younger.
Yeah.
"I, I don't know how young you'd have to go"
"but I think by the time they're, oh, early teenagers anyway, I think it's too late now. At least around here."
"Yeah,"
"I think, uh, I think it does help, um, even preschoolers, you know"
"they're, um, things even just starting around the home.  You know"
Right.
little ones can do a little bit to help the family.
Uh-huh.
"We're just,"
"I'm sorry they're breaking the team up, because we liked all the ones that were on there."
I know.
I'm amazed.
I'm not sure I like the new ones too much.
Huh-uh.
"I'm surprised that, I was surprised at the ending of, you know, with all the funny things happening and different things."
"I just wonder if, if, uh, they just want to go on to other projects and not be stuck in this show, since it's gone on for so long,"
"it looks like, it looks like it might be one of these seven or eight year run things. Where you kind of can spend your whole career on one show."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I know.
"Of course, I guess that's not bad."
Alan Alda did it on MASH.
I know.
Isn't that funny?
It hasn't hurt him at all.
"So do you, do you mostly like this type of like a story type of thing that lasts an hour?"
"Oh, I don't usually like stuff that continues."
"That's why I'm surprised I like those two shows, because usually I like, you know, stuff that just ends sort of, that you just, you don't have to, have watched, you know."
"In one hour, like QUANTUM LEAP."
Yeah.
"I mean, you don't have to ..."
That's one of our favorites
Yeah.
"You don't have to have watched it last week in order to follow,"
"so, you know, I usually don't like that."
"Right,"
"which they do at the beginning of the season, to grab your attention. You know,"
Uh-huh.
that's always a bummer too.
Yeah.
"So, I really, I really like that,"
"but, people are really concerned,"
"it's just that sometimes it's not the right people, which is really, really sad because, I wish we would do more"
Yeah.
"At work we started, uh, all the recycling stuff."
"They're really trying,"
I think what started it at work was that planet earth thing we had last year.
Yes.
"And, uh, that really, started a lot of stuff off,"
"but, you know sometimes it dwindles down."
"Yeah,"
where I work now we recycle all the computer paper.
That's good.
But that's about the extent of it.
"Well that's, uh,"
at least your trying something.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"It's just yeah,"
it would be nice if it could be more.
"And I'm sure that the, uh, driving factor for recycling the computer paper is that we get paid to do so."
Oh do you really.
"We sell the paper back to the, uh, to a paper manufacturing company."
Well that's a neat idea.
"Well, it, it defrays the cost of buying the paper, I think."
"I,"
"not by much, but it does defray it some."
Right.
Enough to make it worth our while to have several bins through out the building.
"Well that's, that's really good,"
I mean at least they're trying.
"but if you look on all interest things, not just credit cards, but on your cars and, you know, any kind of interest that you're paying, from a personal point of view, that might make certain sense in stimulating consumer purchasers."
Sure.
"So that's a lot of the games that politicians play on where they want to go, you know, tax things that they don't, you know, to a degree, well, like booze, you know,"
"example, they keep raising the taxes on booze,"
"it gets to the point, you know, it makes drunks sober, you know"
They quit buying it.
"Well, what, what about the taxes on cigarettes?"
"Well, tell me about your home."
Okay.
"Uh, right now we're living in,"
"well it's me, my wife and, uh, two young boys."
"And, uh, right now we're in a, uh, I guess it's either a zero lot line or a garden home. Which you might call it."
Uh-huh.
"So we don't have a, a big yard. Uh,"
"but, uh, when my wife and I first moved in, it was just the two of us."
So it was enough.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, and it's, uh, I guess what they call a story and a half."
"Because it's not a full two story. Where, you know, everything on top is on bottom."
Yeah.
"So, it's got real high ceilings on half the house"
and the other half is just standard sized ceilings.
Huh.
"And, uh, it's about a five year old house now."
It sounds nice.
"It's, uh, pretty nice."
"Unfortunately, the builder who built it went out of business already"
"Oh, yeah?"
Yeah.
"It was a,"
Landmark is the one who built it.
Yeah.

"Sevier was born in 1896 in Madison Parish, Louisiana, a son of the former Roxie Roberta Allen and James Douglas Sevier, Sr., a native of Port Gibson, in Claiborne County in southwestern Mississippi. His parents moved to Madison Parish in 1880, where his father became a planter. Sevier attended local segregated schools for his lower education. He graduated in 1917 from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge."
"His father's family were descended from John Sevier, a veteran of the American Revolution, and pioneer and first governor of Tennessee. He was the namesake of Sevierville in Sevier County in eastern Tennessee. His line became prominent in northeastern Louisiana. One of Henry's cousins was Andrew L. Sevier, who served as a Louisiana State Senator with repeated reelection, from 1932 until his death in office in 1962."
"During World War I, Henry Sevier served as a second lieutenant in the United States Army. He was wounded sixteen times in France, and received the Purple Heart and the Silver Star medals."
"After the war, in 1918 Sevier married the former Retta Brooks (1899-1992) of Shreveport in northwestern Louisiana. The couple had three children: Carolyn S. Yerger (1921-1997), who married Rufus Taft Yerger, Sr. (1914-1973); Roberta Sevier Gandy (1924-2006), who married Robert Wyly Gandy, Jr. (1915-1987), and Henry Clay Sevier, Jr. (born c. 1926), who became an attorney and a partner in his father's law firm for a time. He later moved to Covington in St. Tammany Parish."

"Sevier decided to enter politics. A member of the Democratic Party, in 1936 Sevier was elected to the Louisiana House from Madison Parish to succeed fellow Democrat, Mason Spencer of Tallulah. Spencer was the husband of his Sevier cousin, Rosa Vertner Sevier Spencer (1891-1978)."
"Sevier was elected a few months after the assassination of Governor Huey Pierce Long, Jr.. At the time, there was much voter sympathy for the pro-Long faction. The staunchly anti-Long Mason Spencer had earlier announced that he would run for governor, but he withdrew before the election. Richard Leche of New Orleans, the choice of the Long faction, won the election uncontested."
"After his law partner Snyder died in 1951, Sevier formed the Sevier, Yerger, and Sevier law firm in Tallulah. (His son Henry became an attorney and his partner in the firm for a period of time.)

"Burke portrays Delta Bishop, a young woman with dreams of writing and singing country music. She became a hairstylist at Mona's House of Hair, married Charlie Bishop and thought she had found happiness. After eight years of marriage, she became restless: she was eager to follow in the footsteps of her childhood idol, Patsy Cline, and become a country music star. She quits her job, leaves her husband and friends behind, and travels to Nashville, Tennessee. There, she finds an apartment over the garage of a home owned by her cousin, Lavonne Overton (Gigi Rice), and her husband, Buck (Bill Engvall). She also finds a job waiting tables at The Green Lantern, a local bar that hosts an amateur night which she believes that if she could sing her songs there, it could jumpstart her career."

"After having a training session, Splinter (Hamato Yoshi) and the Turtles celebrate their 15th anniversary of being mutated, and Splinter tells them the story of how they came to be. After the story, the Turtles convince Splinter to allow them to travel to the surface."
"After taking a trip out of the sewers for the first time since being mutated, the Turtles witness April O'Neil and her father Kirby getting captured by The Kraang. Donatello develops a crush upon seeing April and concludes that the Turtles must save her and her father. The Turtles have a brief battle with the Kraang, but they are defeated since they aren't used to fighting as a team. As a result, the Kraang escape, with April and Kirby as their prisoners."
"Back at the lair, Splinter agrees that the Turtles must save April and Kirby, and picks Leonardo as the leader of the team, much to Raphael's irritation."
"While searching for April and Kirby, they meet Snake, a guy who works for the Kraang. Raph threatens to pour mutagen on him if he doesn't tell the Turtles information about the Kraang. Snake confesses, telling them everything he knows, before Michelangelo accidentally lets him escape. At the lair, Splinter tells Leo that failure is a possibility that every leader must face, and tells him the story of how he and Oroku Saki the Shredder were once friends, but became enemies."
"The Turtles eventually find the Kraang, and Snake accidentally gets mutagen ooze poured on him, and becomes a mutated plant. The Turtles enters the Kraang's facility, and begin to battle them, but before they can reach April and Kirby, they come across Snake in his mutant form, which Mikey dubs ""Snakeweed"". Snakeweed is seeking revenge against the Turtles for his mutation, and they go on to fight him. Donnie goes on to save April and Kirby while Leo, Raph and Mikey continue to fight Snakeweed. Donnie manages to save April, but the Kraang escape with Kirby. Snakeweed eventually blows up and the Turtles and April escape from the Kraang. However, Snakeweed's heart starts beating again, indicating this isn't the last they'll see of him."
"The Turtles made the news, but the Shredder watches the news back at Tokyo, Japan, discovering Splinter's symbol on the ninja star, concluding that he and the Foot Clan must relocate to New York to finish off Splinter."
"Max Nicholson of IGN gave ""Rise of The Turtles"" a rating of 8.5/10, saying ""The action sequences are fluid, fast-paced and exciting, and the dialogue-heavy scenes are usually peppered with entertaining slapstick."" Toon Zone reviewer Grant White gave the episode a positive review, saying ""Although I enjoyed this premiere, not everything sat well with me. There are some parts of both the writing and animation that felt poor and sometimes overlapped."" Noel Kirkpatrick at TV.com called the episode ""a tad on the bland side"". He cites that while there's plenty for surprises for the show's plot, ""in laying the groundwork, this pilot didn't really do anything new"". Matt Edwards at Den of Geek opined that the episode is ""so polished and ell executed,"" and praised it for its balance of comedy and action, stating ""A very strong start to the series, then, and one I’ve found myself revisiting frequently."""

= = = John Francis Dodge = = =
"John Francis Dodge (October 25, 1864 – January 14, 1920) was an American automobile manufacturing pioneer and co-founder of Dodge Brothers Company."
"Dodge was born in Niles, Michigan, where his father ran a foundry and machine shop. John and his younger brother, Horace, were inseparable as children and as adults. The origins of the Dodge family lie in Stockport, England, where their ancestral home still stands."
"In 1886, the Dodge family moved to Detroit, where John and Horace took jobs at a boiler maker plant. In 1894 they went to work as machinists at the Dominion Typograph Company in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. While John was the sales-minded managerial type, his brother Horace was a gifted mechanic and inveterate tinkerer. Using a dirt-proof ball bearing Horace invented and patented, in 1897 Dodge arranged a deal for the brothers to join with a third-party investor to manufacture bicycles. Within a few years, they sold the bicycle business and in 1900 used the proceeds of the sale to set up their own machine shop in Detroit."
"In their first year of business, the Dodge brothers' company began making parts for the automobile industry. In 1902 the Dodge brothers won a contract to build transmissions for the Olds Motor Vehicle Company upon which they built a solid reputation for quality and service. However, the following year they turned down a second contract from Olds to retool their Detroit plant at Hastings Street and Monroe Avenue to build engines for Henry Ford in a deal that included a share position in the new Ford Motor Company. By 1910, John Dodge and his brother were so successful they built a new plant in Hamtramck, Michigan."
"For ten years (1903–1913), the Dodge brothers' business was a Ford Motor Company supplier, and Dodge worked as vice president of the Ford company. He left Ford in 1913, and in 1914 he and Horace formed Dodge Brothers to develop their own line of automobiles. They began building motor trucks for the United States military during the arms buildup for World War I, and in October 1917 they produced their first commercial car. At war's end, their company produced and marketed both cars and trucks."
He was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1997.
"Because of his temper and often crude behavior, the red-haired Dodge was seen as socially unacceptable to most of the well-heeled elite of Detroit. Nevertheless, his wealth made him an influential member of the community and he became active in Republican Party politics in Michigan."
"The Dodge brothers were the sons of machinist Daniel Rugg Dodge (1819–1897) and Maria Duval Casto (1823–1906). Maria was Daniel's second wife. They had an elder full sister: Della Lone (1863–1936) and older half brother Charles Frontier Dodge (1855–1926), and half sister Laura Belle (1858-?) from Daniel's first marriage to Lorinda Gould (1820–1860)."
John Dodge married Canadian Ivy Hawkins (1864–1901) in September 1892. They had three children:
"Following Ivy (Hawkins) Dodge's death from tuberculosis, he secretly married Isabelle Smith (who was his housekeeper) in Walkerville, Ontario, on December 8, 1902. They separated in 1905 and quietly divorced in 1907; the marriage was kept secret until after the death of his third wife. Shortly after the divorce from Isabelle, Dodge married his secretary, Matilda Rausch (1883–1967). Dodge had three more children with Matilda:"
"In 1908, John Dodge and Matilda purchased the land for Meadow Brook Farms near Rochester, Michigan. At Meadow Brook, their eldest child, Frances, developed a love of horses that led her to acquire Castleton Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, and turn it into one of the leading horse breeding operations in the United States. Dodge's daughter Isabel established Brookmeade Stable. It became a major participant in Thoroughbred horse racing and owned several Champions, including the U.S. Racing Hall of Fame horses Cavalcade and Sword Dancer. Five years after Dodge's death in 1920, Matilda married Alfred Wilson and they built the Meadow Brook Hall at the Rochester estate."
His great grandson is film producer John F Dodge III.
"John and Horace contracted influenza and pneumonia while in New York City during the 1918 flu pandemic. John died on January 14, 1920, at the Ritz-Carlton, aged 55. He was interred in the Egyptian-style family mausoleum in Detroit's Woodlawn Cemetery guarded by two Sphinx statues."
"Horace died the following December, and in 1925 their widows sold the Dodge Brothers automobile business to Dillon Read, investment bankers, for $146 million (equivalent to $ in ). Dodge's newborn daughter Anna Margaret died of the measles before age five. His son Daniel drowned in the waters off Manitoulin Island after falling overboard while being transported to hospital following an accident involving dynamite. He had just recently married, at age 21."
"After Dodge's death, Matilda married Alfred Wilson and adopted two children with him, Richard and Barbara Wilson. Matilda Dodge Wilson was Lieutenant Governor of Michigan briefly in 1940 under Republican Governor Luren Dickinson."
"In 1957, the Wilsons donated their Meadow Brook Farm, including Meadow Brook Hall, Sunset Terrace and all its other buildings and collections, along with $2 million (equivalent to $ in ), to Michigan State University to establish an extension campus. In 1963, the Michigan State University-Oakland was renamed Oakland University."
= = = Nachman Goldstein = = =
"Nachman Goldstein of Tcherin (1825 – 1894), also known as the Tcheriner Rav (rabbi of Tcherin, a town in eastern Ukraine), was a leading disciple of Nathan of Breslov (known as ""Reb Noson""), who in turn was the chief disciple of Rebbe Nachman of Breslov, the founder of the Breslov Hasidic dynasty."
"A child prodigy who excelled in his Torah studies even as a young boy, Goldstein was the grandson of Rabbi Aharon, the chief rabbi of Breslov in Rebbe Nachman's day, and the son of Rabbi Zvi Aryeh, the succeeding rabbi of Breslov. He grew up in the town of Breslov. However, in his youth he shied away from Reb Noson. Once Reb Noson said to him, ""Nachman, who knows? Maybe the reason Rebbe Nachman worked so hard to bring your grandfather to Breslav was because of ""you""?"" After that, Goldstein became a follower of Reb Noson, and after the latter's death, became very involved with Reb Noson's works."
"Goldstein raised his daughter's son, Abraham Sternhartz, after the latter was orphaned of his parents as a young child. As the grandson of Reb Noson's leading disciple and at the same time a great-grandson of Noson through his father's line, Sternhartz was privy to all the family traditions and stories about Rebbe Nachman's closest disciple. These formed the basis for his definitive collection of Breslov oral traditions, entitled ""Tovot Zichronot""."

"Sol Goldman (born Usher Selig Goldman, September 2, 1917 – October 18, 1987) was an American real estate developer. Together with his partner, Alex DiLorenzo, Goldman became the biggest non-institutional real estate investor in New York City in the 1980s, ultimately owning a portfolio of nearly 1900 commercial and residential properties."
"Goldman was born to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, the son of Fannie and Charles Goldman. His father owned a grocery store. Goldman briefly attended Brooklyn College, before turning to real estate during the Great Depression. At age 16, he purchased his first of many foreclosed properties by raising money from his neighbors. In the 1950s, he partnered with Alex DiLorenzo Jr. Together they were very active purchasers through the 1950s and 1960s and their portfolio included the Chrysler Building which they bought in 1960. Although the 1970s were difficult—he lost the Chrysler Building to foreclosure and his partner, DiLorenzo, died in 1975—Goldman continued to invest, purchasing more than 600 buildings in the subsequent years via his company Solil Management (named after Sol and his wife, Lil). Goldman was known for holding onto his properties and rarely selling, preferring instead to sign tenants to long-term ground leases (typically 99 years) where the tenants pay an annual rent to Goldman but are responsible for taxes and upkeep of buildings on the properties."
"The Sol Goldman Pancreatic Cancer Research Center at Johns Hopkins University is named in his honor, following a gift of $10 million."
"In 1941, he married Lillian Schuman, who was also Jewish. They had four children: Allan H. Goldman, Diane Goldman Kemper, Amy P. Goldman, and Jane Goldman. Upon his death at the age of 70 in 1987, he owned New York's largest private real estate portfolio with more than 600 properties valued at $1 billion. His wife and three daughters engaged in litigation over his assets with his wife eventually receiving 1/3rd of his estate. His nephew, Lloyd Goldman, is also a notable real-estate investor in New York City. His children, Allan Goldman and Jane Goldman manage the remaining real estate assets amounting to $6.0B via the firm Solil Management."

"Within five years of the house leaving the Taft family, the front veranda was removed, replaced by a one-story porch. Other modifications were the addition of a conservatory and the demolition of outbuildings, including a stable. Upon Thompson's death the house was sold by his widow to Colonel Ernest H. Ruffner in 1912. Upon Ruffner's death it was sold by his daughter. The William Howard Taft Memorial Association was formed on July 7, 1937, in hopes of buying the property, but went without support of the Taft family, as Robert Taft thought it would look too opportunistic to memorialize the house his father grew up in, and thus failed in acquiring the $12,000 to buy it. In the 1940s the building was used as apartments, with the new owner Elbert R. Bellinger once considering selling it to become a funeral parlor for local blacks. Taft family political fortunes faltered with Robert's death in 1953, and with Charles Phelps Taft II available to spearhead the movement, the William Howard Taft Memorial Association eventually acquired the house for $35,000 (the assessment price), instead of the $75,000 Bellinger was demanding for it."
"By 1961, the house was in poor condition and needed restoration, to the tune of $92,500. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964. A ceremony on September 15, 1964 (William's 107th birthday), celebrated the home becoming a National Historic Landmark."
"The association gained full title to the house in 1968 and in 1969 transferred it to the National Park Service, which currently operates the site as a historic house museum, so that its future upkeep is ensured. The United States government took the property title on November 1, 1970."
Letters and diary entries written by Louise Taft during her time in the home helped preservationists to return the domicile to how it appeared during William's childhood.
"William Howard Taft National Historic Site has two main buildings. The first is the original home owned by William Howard Taft's parents, Alphonso and Louise Taft. It has been restored to look as it did during the time William lived there. All the family portraits and many of the books on display belonged to the Taft family. The first floor has five rooms restored: William's birthplace, and four rooms representative of the period. The furniture is period pieces and did not necessarily belong to the Tafts.

"The first teaching done on the islands was by a fisherman, John Feltham, who was asked by William Tiller to stay ashore rather than fish to teach his boys. Feltham agreed to this, and sometime later, in 1829, he was appointed by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (S.P.G.), to be a teacher. In 1830 there were about 25 students, but this school was discontinued in 1834. The next record of school was by the teacher Edward Churnside Bishop under the Newfoundland School Society from 1843 to 1883. In 1869 a new school house was built; and the last teacher to teach at Swain's Island was Annie Alice Hall in 1901."
"Swain's Island was settled because of its prime location and advantages in the various fisheries.

"The 19th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (2nd Latvian) (, ) was an infantry division of the Waffen-SS during World War II. It was the second Latvian division formed in January 1944, after its sister unit, the 15th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Latvian) with which it formed the Latvian Legion. It was surrounded in the Courland Pocket at the end of the war where it surrendered to the Red Army."
"The division was formed in January 1944, from 2 SS Infantry Brigade with the addition of a newly raised third regiment, Waffen Grenadier Regiment 46 (Latvian No. 6). Simultaneously, the designations of the two other grenadier regiments were changed from 39 and 40 to 42 and 43 respectively. The commander of the SS brigade, SS-Oberführer Hinrich Schuldt became the first commander of the division. After Schuldt was killed in action on 15 March 1944, SS-Standartenführer Friedrich-Wilhelm Bock temporarily took command, being replaced on April 13 by SS-Oberführer Bruno Streckenbach, who led the division until the end of war."
= = = Valu (film) = = =
"Valu is a 2008 comedy Marathi film directed by Umesh Vinayak Kulkarni. The film featured in various international film festivals as The Wild Bull. It also became the first Marathi film to be selected in Rotterdam International Film Festival 2008, the Netherlands."
"In the small village of Kusavde, there is a lonely misunderstood wild bull. The bull, ""Valu"", is actually a holy, consecrated bull which is the responsibility of the village. It is allowed to roam free and is the responsibility of the entire village. But lately, Valu becomes very aggressive and is blamed for every single act of chaos and destruction that happens in and around the village. Now, catching the bull becomes equivalent to establishing power in the village for the leaders and for those who are interested in the fringe benefits."
The film intertwines various stories of the war between the two leaders; love stories that bloom in the midst of the adventure; an amateur filmmaker who struggles to shoot a documentary; the forest officer who leads this chaos like a sacred mission along with the religious priest; the tricksters and an insane woman who seems to understand the mind of Valu.
= = = Bangers and Mash (TV series) = = =
"Bangers and Mash is a British children's cartoon series originally broadcast on Children's ITV in 1989, and repeated until around 1993. The series consists of 25 five-minute episodes."
"The series revolves around the adventures of two chimpanzees, Bangers and Mash, and is based on a series of children books by Paul Groves and Edward McLachlan. This series of reading books were used in schools in the 1980s. The series' narration and character voices were provided by Jonathan Kydd, and the incidental music and theme tune were written and performed by Chas & Dave."
"Bangers and Mash are troublemakers and through wanting to have fun, would cause grief for others, namely making a mess or breaking something of importance, normally belonging to their parents (or Gran, who also lives with them). Like all the inhabitants of their island, they live in a house built on top of a tree (their address being No. 3 Tree Street)."
"Other characters of significance on the show include Bangers' and Mash's parents, their grandmother, their dog Mick, their friend Petal (who would often physically hurt them if their antics annoyed her too much), their teacher Mrs. Chum (who often resorts to the same punishment; making them write their ABC's ten times) and the local witch, Mrs. Snitchnose; a rat-like creature with a long nose with hairs coming on the end of it."

"In 2006 and 2007, Fahey spent time in Afghanistan assisting the newly established American University of Afghanistan, and launching a project to assist orphans in Kabul."
"Fahey's recent humanitarian work has revolved around the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, in which he has been focusing on the subject of warehousing, a practice in which the rights and mobility of refugees is restricted by a host country. Fahey's work specifically has addressed the subject of warehoused Sahrawi refugees in Algeria."
= = = Abdul Karim Khan = = =
"Ustad Abdul Karim Khan (Devanagari: अब्दुल करीम ख़ान, Persian: <bdi> </bdi>) (11 November 1872 – 27 October 1937), was an Indian classical singer and, along with his cousin Abdul Wahid Khan, the founder of the Kirana gharana."
"Abdul Karim Khan was born on 11 November 1872 in Kairana town in Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh into a family with music tradition which traced its roots to musician brothers Ghulam Ali and Ghulam Maula. His father, Kale Khan, was the grandson of Ghulam Ali. Abdul Karim Khan received training from his uncle Abdullah Khan and father Kale Khan. He also received guidance from another uncle, Nanhe Khan. Abdul Karim Khan was musically influenced by Ustad Rahmat Khan of Gwalior gharana. Apart from vocals and sarangi, he also learned Veena (Been), Sitar and Tabla."
"According to a story, he was initially a sarangi player, but decided to switch to vocals because of low status of sarangi players. In his early years, he used to sing with his brother Abdul Haq. They appeared before Murtaza Khan of the ""Maula Bakhsh Khandan"" to appear before the Maharaja (king) and were influenced by Murtaza's style. The king of Baroda State was impressed by this singing duo and made them the court musicians. This is where he met Tarabai Mane, who was the daughter of Sardar Maruti Rao Mane, a member of the royal family. When they decided to get married, they were ousted from Baroda. The couple settled down in Bombay. In 1922, Tarabai Mane left Abdul Karim Khan, which apparently had a major impact on his music – making it pensive and meditative. Karim Khan's first wife, Gafooran, was the sister of another Kirana master Abdul Wahid Khan, who was also his cousin."
"""One of the most melodious classical musicians we have had, Abdul Karim Khan's music always created a sublime atmosphere. The soothing quality of his specially cultivated voice, and his repose style of singing were such that the singer as well as his listeners forgot themselves in a sort of 'trance'."""
"Abdul Karim Khan was invited to the Mysore court where he met famous Carnatic music masters who also influenced his music. In particular the singing of his sargam was a direct influence of Carnatic practice. He became a frequent visitor to Mysore Palace which conferred on him the title ""Sangeet Ratna"". On the way to Mysore he used to stay with his brother in Dharwad where he taught his most famous disciple Sawai Gandharva. In 1900, for eight months he taught Kesarbai Kerkar, who would go on to be one of the 20th century's most renowned vocalists. In 1913, he founded the Arya Sangeet Vidyalaya in Poona to teach music students. He finally settled down in Miraj till his death in 1937 when returning from a concert tour of the South. Every year in August commemorative music concerts are held in Miraj in his honour."
The innovations he brought to his vocal style distinguishes Kirana style from others. The slow melodic development of the raga in Vilambit laya (slow tempo) was the most characteristic aspect of his music. He worked hard to maintain his voice to be sweet and melodious which shaped his music. The thumri style he developed is also quite different from the 'Poorab ang' or 'Punjabi ang'. His thumri progresses in a leisurely slow pace with ample abandonment. He was also the first Hindustani musician to seriously study the Carnatic system and probably the first to be invited to sing all over the South. He has even recorded a Thyagaraja Krithi. He was also influenced by Rehmat Khan of the Gwalior gharana and adopted the direct style of presentation.
"""Although frail-looking, Khan Saheb maintained excellent health through regular exercises, disciplined habits, and frugal living. His photographs show him as a tall, slim person dressed immaculately in a black 'achkan', a cane in hand, a typical moustache and a red gold-bordered turban, and most striking of all, his dreamy eyes."""
"Abdul Karim's disciples include Rambhau Kundagolkar (Sawai Gandharva), Roshan Ara Begum, Sureshbabu Mane, and Vishwanathbuwa Jadhav."
Ustad Abdul Karim Khan died on 27 October 1937

Ambition... was Preceded by two additional releases. her first fragrance ""Because of You..."" and her second fragrance ""Fascinate"". Each scent was followed with its own Eau De Parfum release and multiple gift sets."
"It was announced on October 21, 2012 that Jordin Sparks would be releasing her third fragrance, titled Ambition... the following month. The fragrance was created by Sparks in mid 2012 and it was released, packaged in a clear white and gold plated spherical bottle, in the United States on November 8, 2012. Sparks' first scent Because of You... was geared toward a much younger demographic however, Ambition is said to be aimed at a more higher-end than her last scent set to be more ""fresh and edgy"", just like the woman who is expected to wear it. The fragrance was initially released exclusively at Bon-Ton Department Stores nationwide, at a retail price of $35 for 65ml / 2.2oz Eau de Parfum, before being released in stores around the country such as Target. According to the Bon-Ton official perfume website, Ambition.. is a ""sophisticated and sensual, modern yet classic, unique yet broadly appealing."" during a behind the scenes look during the promotional photo shoot for the scent, she revealed the reason behind naming the fragrance ""Ambition"". Sparks states ""I want to do it all, that's why Ambition is called what it is, because that's how I feel my life right now. I want to do everything, and I feel there is a lot of people out there like me that are just as ambitious... Right now, I feel like I can take on the world... Ambition is the perfect word for where I am in my life right now."" When it came around to Sparks' creating her new scent she was more focused on what to leave out. Specifically, anything that would make her grandmother sneeze or break out in hives. ""My nana is allergic to everything!... So for me, one of my big things was that I wanted my nana to smell it and not have an allergic reaction. she also notes that her mother inspired her to get into the beauty business stating ""My mom used to have this pretty display with tons of perfume bottles and I’d always look at them. So I knew from a young age that I wanted to make my own fragrance one day."

"Prajavani (PV) has a history of being a politically independent newspaper, although it tends to opine with a liberal tilt. It is known for espousing the causes of Dalits, encouraging women's empowerment and taking pro-poor positions on economic issues. It has managed to maintain an independent position, despite an increasingly polarized media landscape in Karnataka. Prajavani uses the tagline ""the most trusted Kannada daily newspaper"", which appears below its masthead."
"Prajavani was the leading Kannada newspaper for decades, until it was overtaken in circulation by ""Vijaya Karnataka"" (VK) in 2004. The gulf between PV and the upstart VK became huge for a while, but the two newspapers appear to be competing much more closely as of 2014, with PV having significantly recovered ground according to industry numbers. Some analysts have also attributed this to the launch of Vijaya Vani, by the original owner of Vijaya Karnataka, Vijay Sankeshwar and his VRL Group, which has apparently eaten into the readership of ""Vijaya Karnataka"". Other regional competitors include ""Udayavani"", ""Varthabharathi"", ""Kannada Prabha"" and ""Samyukta Karnataka""."

"Operation of the first subway began on October 27, 1904, with the opening of the original 28 stations of the New York City Subway from City Hall to 145th Street on the West Side Branch including the 103rd Street station."
"In 1948, platforms on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line from 103rd Street to 238th Street were lengthened to to allow full ten-car express trains to platform. Previously the stations could only platform six-car local trains. The platform extensions were opened in stages. On April 6, 1948, the platform extension opened for stations from 103rd Street to Dyckman Street, with the exception of 125th Street."

"This station was part of the original subway, and has two side platforms and three tracks, the center one being an unused express track. The southbound local track is known as BB1 and the northbound one is BB4; the BB designation is used for chaining purposes along the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line from 96th Street to 242nd Street and not in everyday speech. Although it cannot be accessed at 103rd Street, the center track is designated as M."
"There is a mezzanine above the platforms, which contains the fare control area, as well as stairs to the street and both platforms."
"This is the southernmost 3-track station on the line. South of the station, there are switches that connect the express track to either local track, with trains then being able to crossover to the rising express tracks from the IRT Lenox Avenue Line. Under 103rd Street, the dual express tracks serving the southern part of the line descend and curve to the east to form the IRT Lenox Avenue Line. They turn off of Broadway and onto 104th Street directly underneath this station. An emergency exit from the Lenox Avenue Line is located in the middle of the northbound platform."
The station has four entrance/exit stairs that serve both platforms:
"A fifth, exit-only stair leads from the northbound platform to the SE corner of Broadway and 104th Street."

The game does not use the film's music, instead featuring an original score by Thomas Egeskov Peterson. It was met with overwhelmingly negative reviews due to simplistic gameplay, poor controls, and jerky animation. Though the graphics were praised, particularly the rendered backgrounds, critics agreed that the gameplay problems were an overriding problem. In late 1996, Acclaim ported a PC version of the game, which received similar criticism."
"""Maniac Games"" gave it a score of 28 out of 100."

"Lead(II) hydroxide, Pb(OH), is a hydroxide of lead, with lead in oxidation state +2. It is doubtful that such a simple compound exists. Lead basic carbonate (PbCO·2Pb(OH)) or lead(II) oxide (PbO) is encountered in practice where lead hydroxide is expected. This has been a subject of considerable confusion in the past."
"When a hydroxide is added to a solution of a lead(II) salt, a hydrated lead oxide PbO·xHO (with x < 1) is obtained. Careful hydrolysis of lead(II) acetate solution yields a crystalline product with a formula 6PbO·2HO = PbO(OH). This material is a cluster compound, consisting of an octahedron of Pb centers, each face of which is capped by an oxide or a hydroxide. The structure is reminiscent of the MoS subunit of the Chevrel phases."
"In solution, lead(II) hydroxide is a somewhat weak base, forming lead(II) ion, Pb, under weakly acidic conditions. This cation hydrolyzes and, under progressively increasing alkaline conditions, forms Pb(OH), Pb(OH)(aqueous), Pb(OH), and other species, including several polynuclear species, e.g., Pb(OH), Pb(OH), PbO(OH)."
The name Lead hydrate has sometimes been used in the past but it is unclear whether this refers to Pb(OH) or PbO·xHO.

= = = White Brotherhood = = =
"The White Brotherhood was an urban society (or militia) of Toulouse established in 1211 during the episcopate of Folquet de Marselha, so-called from its members' habit of wearing white crosses on their chests. The society, called a ""pious institution"" by William of Puylaurens, was militant towards usurers (Jews) and Cathars, robbing them and destroying their homes. Most of the Whites came from the city proper. A Black Brotherhood, so-called in opposition to the White, was soon formed and the two factions went to war in the streets of Toulouse. According to Puylaurens:"
"Daily the two parties would clash, banners flying, bristling with weapons, even with cavalry in evidence. Through the agency of His servant the bishop, Our Lord came to bring them, not a bad peace but a good war."
"From the White Brotherhood Folquet selected 500 men-at-arms and sent them to aid the Albigensian Crusade in besieging Lavaur. The bishop even composed pro-Crusade ""sirventes"" for the troops to sing. Count Raymond VII, however, forbade the citizens to go and tried to force Folquet from the city. The White Brotherhood did go, however, and the bishop eventually left as well, to join the siege at Lavaur."
"The White Brotherhood gained notoriety among the opponents of the Crusade. The troubadour Gavaudan wrote the song ""A la plus longa nuech de l'an"" in which he criticises the ""foolish white people"", almost certainly a reference to the Whites of Toulouse."

"As an extension to the problem, consider the case where the player is allowed to look in Envelope A before deciding whether to switch. In this ""conditional switching"" problem, it is often possible to generate a gain over the ""never switching"" strategy"", depending on the probability distribution of the envelopes."
"The envelope paradox dates back at least to 1953, when Belgian mathematician Maurice Kraitchik proposed a puzzle in his book ""Recreational Mathematics"""
"concerning two equally rich men who meet and compare their beautiful neckties, presents from their wives, wondering which tie actually cost more money. He also introduces a variant in which the two men compare the contents of their purses. He assumes that each purse is equally likely to contain 1 up to some large number ""x"" of pennies, the total number of pennies minted to date. The men do not look in their purses but each reasons that they should switch. He does not explain what is the error in their reasoning. It is not clear whether the puzzle already appeared in an earlier 1942 edition of his book. It is also mentioned in a 1953 book on elementary mathematics and mathematical puzzles by the mathematician John Edensor Littlewood, who credited it to the physicist Erwin Schroedinger, where it concerns a pack of cards, each card has two numbers written on it, the player gets to see a random side of a random card, and the question is whether one should turn over the card. Littlewood's pack of cards is infinitely large and his paradox is a paradox of improper prior distributions."
"Martin Gardner popularized Kraitchik's puzzle in his 1982 book ""Aha! Gotcha"", in the form of a wallet game:"
"Gardner confessed that though, like Kraitchik, he could give a sound analysis leading to the right answer (there is no point in switching), he could not clearly put his finger on what was wrong with the reasoning for switching, and Kraitchik did not give any help in this"

"In 1988 and 1989, Barry Nalebuff presented two different two-envelope problems, each with one envelope containing twice what is in the other, and each with computation of the expectation value 5""A""/4. The first paper just presents the two problems. The second discusses many solutions to both of them. The second of his two problems is nowadays the more common, and is presented in this article. According to this version, the two envelopes are filled first, then one is chosen at random and called Envelope A. Martin Gardner independently mentioned this same version in his 1989 book ""Penrose Tiles to Trapdoor Ciphers and the Return of Dr Matrix"". Barry Nalebuff's asymmetric variant, often known as the Ali Baba problem, has one envelope filled first, called Envelope A, and given to Ali. Then a fair coin is tossed to decide whether Envelope B should contain half or twice that amount, and only then given to Baba."

He played college football for the University of Texas, and earned All-American honors. A second-round pick in the 1996 NFL Draft, he played for the Jacksonville Jaguars for his entire pro football career."
"Brackens was born and raised in Fairfield, Texas. He attended Fairfield High School, and played for the Fairfield Eagles high school football team."
"Brackens attended the University of Texas at Austin, where he played for the Texas Longhorns football team from 1992 to 1995. He developed a reputation as a ferocious hitter as a defensive end. As senior in 1995, he was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American and was also a first-team All-Southwest Conference selection. He finished his career ranked eighth on the Longhorns' all-time list with 24 sacks. He was also a key contributor to the 1995 Longhorns team that went 10-1 and won the Southwest Conference and gained a berth in the 1996 Sugar Bowl against the Virginia Tech Hokies."
"He was taken in the second round of the 1996 NFL draft by the Jacksonville Jaguars, for whom he played his entire professional career. His lone Pro Bowl appearance came in 2000, after the 1999 season in which he had 12 sacks and 8 forced fumbles. As of 2011, he held the all-time Jacksonville Jaguars records for several categories: sacks (55), fumble recoveries (13) and forced fumbles (28). He is also the leading tackler (all-time) among Jaguars defensive ends."
"He was released in 2004, after a series of troubling leg injuries and operations. About his release, Brackens stated, ""Mentally and physically, I thought I could probably still do it, but I didn’t want to put up with all the rule changes. All the stuff they’re doing to players takes the fun out of the game.""

"Israel Bush Richardson (December 26, 1815 – November 3, 1862) was a United States Army officer during the Mexican–American War and American Civil War, where he was a major general in the Union Army. Nicknamed ""Fighting Dick"" for his prowess on the battlefield, he was mortally wounded at the Battle of Antietam near Sharpsburg, Maryland."
"Richardson was born in Fairfax, Vermont. He was reportedly a descendant of famed American Revolutionary War general Israel Putnam. He was appointed from Vermont to the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York. He graduated 38th out of 52 cadets in the Class of 1841. He was one of 23 classmates who would become generals during the Civil War. After some routine assignments, Richardson served as a second lieutenant in the Second Seminole War in Florida. He was promoted to first lieutenant on Sep 21, 1846."
"He received two brevets for meritorious service during the Mexican–American War, to captain and major for the actions at Contreras, Churubusco, and Chapultepec. In Mexico while serving under General Winfield Scott in the Army of Occupation, he received his nickname, ""Fighting Dick"", which would carry over to the Civil War."
"He later served as a captain in the 3rd U.S. Infantry (a rank he achieved in 1851) at various frontier outposts in Texas and New Mexico Territory, San Antonio, Texas 1848–49, Post Opposite El Paso del Norte, 1849–1850; Fort Fillmore 1851–52, 1852–53; Fort Webster, 1852, 1853–54; and Fort Thorn, 1854–55. He then resigned his commission in 1855 and began farming near Pontiac, Michigan."
"When the Civil War broke out, Richardson was still farming in Michigan. He enlisted in the Union Army and recruited and organized the 2nd Michigan Infantry. He married Fannie Travor on May 18, 1861, in Wayne County, Michigan. When he reported with his regiment in Washington, DC, General Winfield Scott greeted him with ""I'm glad to have my 'Fighting Dick' with me again"". Richardson, promoted to colonel on May 25, 1861, was assigned command of the 4th Brigade, 1st Division, in the newly organized army of Brigadier General Irvin McDowell. His brigade saw limited action at the First Battle of Bull Run near Blackburn's Ford, and in covering the subsequent federal withdrawal to Washington. He was promoted to brigadier general, ranking from May 17, 1861."
"He commanded several brigades in the Army of the Potomac and then the 1st Division of the II Corps during the Peninsula Campaign in mid-1862. He was involved in the fighting at the battles of Yorktown, Seven Pines, and the Seven Days. He was particularly distinguished in sharp fighting near the Chickahominy River. Richardson was promoted to major general after the Seven Days Battles. His division was stationed in Washington, DC, during the Second Battle of Bull Run and did not participate in that engagement."
"Richardson's 1st Division played a key role during the Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862, attacking Confederate positions in the center of the Sunken Road in support of the 3rd Division of Maj. Gen. William H. French. After stubborn fighting, by 1:00 pm, Richardson had gained control of the high ground in front of the apex of the defensive line, and his men enfiladed the remaining defenders in the road, which would gain the nickname ""Bloody Lane"" for the carnage. Richardson pushed forward beyond the road and was directing the fire of his artillery and organizing another attack when he was struck by a shell fragment."
"Carried to the rear, Richardson was treated at a field hospital. His wound was not considered life-threatening, and he was given a room in Major General George B. McClellan's headquarters, the Pry House. President Abraham Lincoln paid his respects to the wounded Richardson during a visit to the battlefield in October. However, infection set in, and then pneumonia, which claimed the life of the popular general in early November. He was among six generals to be killed or mortally wounded at Antietam."
"His body was escorted to Detroit. Large crowds lined the streets during his funeral procession to nearby Pontiac, where he was buried in Oak Hill Cemetery."
"Fort Richardson, a Texas frontier fort active from 1867 to 1878, was named for him."
"The Israel B. Richardson Camp #2 of the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War in Oakland, Michigan, was also named for the fallen general."
"Battery Richardson, a 12-inch coast artillery gun battery at Fort Hancock, New Jersey, was named for him."

"Jere Wood (born c. 1949) is the former mayor of Roswell, Georgia, serving five consecutive terms. Mayor Wood defeated Democrat ""Pug"" Mabry, who served as mayor for over thirty years, in the election of 1997. During his election he ran on the platform of slow-growth, fighting urban sprawl and what he viewed as its negative side effects. At the time, he promised to only be a two-term mayor. He ran unchallenged and secured re-election in 2001. Wood is the son of Roy ""Splinter"" Wood, a Democrat, who was Undersecretary of the United States Department of the Interior (DOI) during the Carter Administration in the 1970s. Wood won the mayor's race again in the election held in November 2005."
"Mayor Wood is a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition, an organization formed in 2006 and co-chaired by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston mayor Thomas Menino."
"During the attempted merger of Comcast and Time Warner Cable, a number of politicians sent letters to the FCC expressing their support. Wood was one of these, stating the merger would help spur business growth. It was later discovered that Wood had actually submitted a letter that had been ghostwritten by Comcast. Wood was just one of a number of politicians exposed by ""The Verge"" to have participated in such a practice."
"In 2016, Roswell resident Michael Litton filed a lawsuit accusing Wood of violating the city of Roswell's charter by seeking a third term as mayor. Wood, who was first elected in 1997, advocated in 2010 for the Roswell mayor to have a term limit of three four-year terms. He has said the intent was that the clock would start for him when the law was passed, and not when he was first elected."
"Although Wood had enjoyed the support of State Representative Betty Price, she has since stated that she does not intend to amend the charter to allow Wood to run for a subsequent term. She had been willing to support a charter change that would allow the mayor to serve out his term, but no more. ""My goal has been to save the city the expense of a costly trial,"" Price said. Since the start of the controversy, the city of Roswell has spent $16,843 through city attorney fees on defending Wood, as of mid-2016. On August 3, 2017, Wood was removed from office after a judge finding he did violate city law."
"In October 2016, Wood filed suit in Fulton Superior Court against Roswell and the Roswell Council Members over whether he could renovate his home. Wood's home is located in the Roswell historic district, which requites prior approval when renovating. He was initially granted approval by the Roswell Historic Preservation Commission to build a 1.5 story, 3,000 square foot house on his property. However, the city council later overturned the decision in August 2016. Wood alleged in the lawsuit that council members acted improperly by deciding the council had the legal authority to reverse the commission's earlier decision. State historic preservation laws allow ""limited authority"" for the council members to ""approve, modify and approve, or reject"" the historic commission’s final decision, but only if it is found that the commission abused its discretion."

By May 1976, the Ministry of Construction released their bulletin ""Policy on Tokuyama Dam Construction Project"". In December 1982, the project was incorporated into the Electric Power Development Basic Plan. It was approved by the government in 1998. The original project was a pumped-storage hydroelectric scheme which consisted of the Tokuyama Dam as the upper reservoir, the Sugihara Dam as the lower and the 400 MW Sugihara Power Plant."
"Construction on the dam started in May 2000 but by May 2004 J-Power and Chubu Electric announced they had changed the design of the project due to the concerns and protests of locals and groups.

"The Meridian Highway Bridge is a bridge that formerly carried U.S. Route 81 across the Missouri River between Nebraska and South Dakota. The Meridian Highway Bridge connects Yankton, South Dakota with rural Cedar County, Nebraska. The Meridian Bridge is a double deck bridge, with the top level having carried traffic into South Dakota from Nebraska, and the lower level having carried traffic into Nebraska from South Dakota."
"The bridge crosses the Missouri River, connecting Yankton, South Dakota to the north with Cedar County, Nebraska to the south. Prior to the construction of the bridge, traffic moved between these two points via a ferry service, started in 1870, and a seasonal pontoon bridge, first installed in 1890. The pontoon bridge was disassembled and rebuilt twice a year, once to float on open water, and once to be placed on solid ice. After a 1915 initiative to build a permanent bridge faltered with the U.S. entrance into World War I, a new effort was started by the Yankton Chamber of Commerce 1919. Though fundraising problems caused a temporary halt in 1922, the new bridge, featuring a movable span to allow for river navigation, was completed during the summer of 1924."
"The dedication ceremony was held on October 11, 1924 and the bridge opened as a toll bridge. It was the last link of the Meridian Highway, which became U.S. Route 81, to be completed. It was designed for use by trains on the lower level of the bridge and vehicular traffic on the upper level; a lift mechanism allowed river traffic to pass below. However, trains never used the lower level. In 1953, all tolls were lifted and the two levels were converted to one-way traffic, northbound on the top, southbound on the bottom."
"In the 1980s, the lift mechanism and counterweights were removed, and the decorative iron railings on the upper level were replaced by Jersey barricades."
The bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.
"On May 9, 2008, a 10-ton gross weight limit was placed on the bridge after an inspection found corrosion on the gusset plates. It was replaced by the Discovery Bridge upon its opening on October 11, 2008, exactly 84 years after the dedication of the Meridian Highway Bridge."
"The bridge was used as location for filming a scene of the 2016 film ""Until Forever""."

The community received its name from the old stone glebehouse (parsonage) that was constructed there in the late 18th century. The stone house later became the Hampshire County Poor Farm and remains standing. The community of Sector lies directly across the river."
"While Glebe no longer has a post office, and only a few residents remain there, it is still a popular spot for canoers and fishermen because of its proximity to the Trough's mouth. For vacationers, sportsmen, and locals alike, Glebe's Trough General Store supplies canoe rentals, fishing supplies, bait, drinks, snacks, and ice."

"Picabo is an unincorporated community in Blaine County, Idaho, United States."
"Picabo is located along U.S. Route 20, about west of Carey, southeast of Hailey, and northeast of Shoshone. It has a gas station, country store, post office, and a small airport. The community is surrounded by large ranches and irrigated fields. The 2000 United States census for this ZIP Code shows a population of 128 in 56 housing units in 104 km (40 square miles)."
"Picabo is located about north of the Snake River along the northern edge of the Snake River Plain, a topographic depression that cuts across the Basin and Range Mountain structures of southern Idaho. The nearest flowing stream is Silver Creek, a scenic spring-fed tributary of the Little Wood River, a key source of irrigation water for eastern Blaine County. The pristine Silver Creek is renowned among fly fisherman and was a favorite of Ernest Hemingway, who enjoyed hunting and fishing along the stream with local rancher, Bud Purdy."
"The name ""Picabo"" supposedly derives from a Native American term translated as ""silver water"". The name ""Picabo"" was made familiar by Picabo Street, an Olympic skier who grew up in nearby Triumph."

"The Prometheus is traveling back to Earth with a Hyperspace engine from an Al'kesh. Every couple of hours, the Prometheus has to jump out of hyperspace to cool down the Al'kesh hyperspace engine. The Prometheus comes near a nebula that Samantha Carter thinks doesn't conform to nebulae she has previously studied. When they jump out of hyperspace, the Prometheus is attacked by an unknown vessel. They can't jump into hyperspace because the engines need to cool down. The Prometheus is chased into a gas cloud by the alien ship. Samantha Carter is knocked out when she tries to convert power from auxiliary to the hyperspace engine to make a small hyperspace jump into the cloud. When she wakes up, all the crew members other than her have disappeared. She alone must get herself and them to safety. She has visions of a little girl running around the ship, playing with bubbles and of her friends, who vocalize her worries and theories about her predicament. Teal'c at one point grabs Carter by the arm and warns her that if she falls asleep she will die."
"The hallucination of Daniel Jackson frankly confesses that he is unreal but he is present because there is something she has overlooked. The hallucination of Teal'c warns her that this whole scenario could be a result of the hostile alien species mind-probing, with a view to her inadvertently surrendering information about the Prometheus' engine technology. Daniel then reappears and tells her that the 'nebula' may be a living being which is why she and the alien ship are stuck inside."
"The hallucinations of Jacob Carter and of Jack O'Neill serve as a means by which Carter confronts her personal life and her relationships (in particular when talking to 'Jack', her feelings for him). 'Jack' tells her he will always be there for her, no matter what."
After an encounter with the small girl who is playing with bubbles Carter hits on a solution. She engages the hyperspace engines with only a fraction of the usual amount of power. This has the effect of rendering the ship partially intangible.
"She contacts the alien ship and offers them the solution to escaping the nebula in exchange for the return of the crew and safe passage. After a confused crew are beamed back in to the Prometheus, Carter creates a hyperspace bubble large enough to encompass both the Prometheus and the alien ship and they both exit the nebula safely. The aliens keep their end of the bargain and jet away. Carter relieves herself of duty and is escorted to the infirmary for massive concussion."
"According to the DVD commentary for Inauguration, ""Grace"" received the highest ratings of any television show on the Sci-Fi network, including all previous Stargate episodes. Amanda Tapping won a Leo Award in the category ""Dramatic Series: Best Lead Performance - Female"" for this episode."

It was also known as the Smurfit–Stone Building and the Stone Container Building and was formerly called the Associates Center. Construction began in 1983 and was completed in 1984. The building, noted for its unusually slanted facade, was designed by Sheldon Schlegman of A. Epstein and Sons. The building has 39 floors of tenant space and the two spires at the top cover the main roof and HVAC equipment."
"Although the building looks as though it is split down the middle, the two sides are only slightly disjointed until nearing the top, where there is a gap between them. At times, its slanted roof—which has been likened to a skyscraper slashed with a knife—displays local sports slogans on its face, such as ""GO BEARS"" and ""GO SOX"". It also displayed ""VOTE 2008"" during the 2008 election day rally at Grant Park."
"At the time of its construction the Crain Communications Building was considered to be a smart building, with sophisticated environmental and security controls. Three years after its completion, the building played a role in the Touchstone Pictures film ""Adventures in Babysitting"". The building is also modeled in EA's ""SimCity 4"", as well as being destroyed in the film """" and in the videogame """"."
"The building name was changed to the Crain Communications Building in March 2012, after Crain Communications moved its headquarters there."
"It is popularly referred to as the Diamond Building or the Vagina Building (from the locally popular but apocryphal story that, with its prominent vertical slit up the front, the building was designed to be a yonic counter to the phallicism of most skyscrapers)."

= = = Competitive Tax Plan = = =
"The Competitive Tax Plan is an approach to taxation, suggested in the United States, that would impose a 10–15% value added tax (VAT) and reduce personal and corporate income taxes. The plan was created by Michael J. Graetz, professor at Columbia Law School and a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Tax Policy. Graetz states that the plan would generate enough revenue so that families with $100,000 of annual income or less — almost 90% of all current filers — would not have to pay income taxes or file tax returns. The Competitive Tax Plan would provide a new payroll tax offset to replace the Earned Income Tax Credit and to protect low and moderate income workers from any tax increase under the new system. Under the initial proposal, households with an annual income of more than $100,000 would be taxed at a flat 25% rate and the corporate income tax rate would be reduced to 25%. Graetz argues that reducing the corporate tax rate ""would make the United States an extremely attractive nation for corporate investments for both U.S. citizens and foreign investors"". In 2013, Graetz presented an updated version of his plan for 2015."
"Michael J. Graetz is professor at Columbia Alumni of Tax Law. He was born at November 20, 1944, in Atlanta, Georgia. He is married and has five children. He is also a leading expert on national and international tax law. He has taught at University of Virginia Law School, University of Southern California, California Institute of Technology, and Yale Law School, and also worked as assistant to the secretary and special counsel for the Department of the Treasury. Graetz won the Daniel M. Holland Medal by the National Tax Association. He has written more than 80 articles on a wide range of tax, international taxation, health policy, and social insurance issues."
"In his work we can see that in comparison to OECD ( Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) , he call the U.S. as a ""Low Tax Country"" , meant as the total federal, state and local tax revenues as a percentage of GDP( Gross Domestic Product) are much lower than the one of OECD. What can be interesting is that the Income Tax in the U.S. in comparison to EU27 and OECD is equal or even higher. The U.S. has according to Graetz's data from 2010 low consumption taxas a percentage of total taxation. Further he mentions that the U.S. has been the only OECD country without a VAT in comparison to more than 160 countries all over the world that has already have a VAT. This needs to change according to his work. So he came with the so called "" the five pieces of competitive tax plan"" The steps are:"
There are some basic principles in the proposal for the goods and service tax:
Proposed VAT is 12.9%.
"The next point in the competitive tax plan is to shrink the income tax. He proposed to limit the income tax only to high income earners in order to ensure federal tax progressivity. Another step is to provide a Family Allowance of $100,000 for married couples ($50,000 for singles, $75,000 for heads of households). This step will eliminate great part of income tax return( more than 120 million), and it also will resulted in fewer than 20 percent of all U.S. tax units will be required to file income tax returns. He stated specific levels of income tax rates. For example, for married couples it will be:"
"The next step of the Proposal is to ""Reduce and Reform the Corporate Income Tax"". Proposed tax rate is 15 percent. This step should solve the problem with international income taxation as it reverse current law’s incentives to locate deductions here and income abroad. It will also repeal the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax. It should simplify small businesses taxation."
"Another part of the plan is to protect low and middle income families in the way that delivering new child credits through debit cards that can be used at the cash register. All children qualify for $1,500 per child( but for married couples with more than $150,000 ($75,000 singles and heads of households), these credits phase-out at a rate of 5%*). For low and moderate income workers it will be even more."
"Next to protecting low and middle income families, the plan also speaks about protecting low and moderate income workers by providing a Payroll Tax Credit of 15.3 percent for wages up to $10,000 and $1,530 per worker for all workers with earnings between $10,000 and $40,000. This credit eliminates all payroll taxes for workers with $10,000 or less of earnings, also it eliminates at least the employees’ share (half) of payroll taxes for workers with earnings below $20,000. Above $40,000 this credit phases out at a rate of 7.65 percent."
No formal bill for the Competitive Tax Plan itself is in Congress; however Senator Ben Cardin's Progressive Consumption Tax Act has many similar features.

"U.S. Coast Guard Air Station San Diego (CGAS San Diego) is a Coast Guard Air Station based in San Diego, California, United States, across the street from San Diego International Airport. CGAS San Diego operates three MH-60T Jayhawk helicopters off the Coast Guard ramp."
"CGAS San Diego is also adjacent to Sector San Diego which houses two 41-foot Utility Boats, two USCG rigid hull inflatable boats (RHIB's), one RB-HS and three RB-S. Being implemented are two Special Purpose Craft-Law Enforcement (SPC-LE), which are USCG vessels used for maritime Law Enforcement. The SPC-LE's have three Mercury Marine engines along with some of the most advanced electronics systems in existence. Also at the station are two USCG Coastal Patrol Boats. The air station is physically separated from the rest of the airfield, such that USCG fixed-wing aircraft must cross a busy, 6-lane city street to reach the runway; street light activation opens the locked gates to the airfield and the air station, and also stops traffic while aircraft are traversing the street."
"Lindbergh Field opened on October 16, 1934 on the Pacific Highway. The San Diego International Airport East Terminal opened on March 6, 1967, and the West Terminal opened July 11, 1979. A new Commuter Terminal opened July 23, 1996. It is self-contained, full service facility with four gates used by seven commuter airlines to handle 25,000 passengers each day. Construction of the expansion of the West Terminal ended in November, 1997. Almost 14 million passengers travel through Lindbergh Field each year. The 27 passenger and cargo airlines operate more than 500 flights each day from the runways."
"On December 11, 1935 negotiations between the City of San Diego and the U.S. Government were concluded which provided of tideland for the construction of a Coast Guard Air Station adjacent to Lindbergh Field, the Municipal Airport. This project had the strong support of many people and agencies, and particularly the Harbor Commission and Department of San Diego and the Chamber of Commerce. The area for this station was deeded to the Coast Guard at no cost, after approval by citizens of San Diego, at a municipal election held in April 1935."
The Royal Victorian Aero Club is an Australian aero club based at Moorabbin Airport in Melbourne. Originating in 1914 (six years before the national airline Qantas) it is amongst the world's oldest Aviation organisations.
"Founded by pioneer aviators in 1914 at Point Cook, the club is one of Australia's oldest flying training organisations."
The Australian Aero Club was formed on 28 October 1914 (and formally established on 9 April 1915) and was subsequently affiliated with the Royal Aero Club of Great Britain. The original hand-written minutes of this historic meeting establishing the club are preserved today.
"Renamed the Victorian Aero Club in October 1934, on 13 March 1935 approval to use the ""Royal"" prefix was granted and since that date the institution has been known as the Royal Victorian Aero Club."
"While originally formed at Point Cook, in 1919 the Club transferred operations to what was then the Commonwealth Aerodrome (or sometimes referred to as ""St Johns Field"") on Bulla Road in Essendon. Club operations were some of the first from St John's Field, as the aerodrome was not officially opened until 1922."
"The Civil Aviation Department provided support to the Australian Aero Club, by providing an establishment gift of six DeHavilland"
"Gypsy Moth aircraft two of which were allocated to the Victorian Chapter. The two Victorian Gypsy Moths, (G-AUAL and G-UAUG) arrived in July 1926 by ship and within a month they were taking part in a major aerial display at Essendon to celebrate the arrival of solo flyer A. J. Cobham from England. The Flying Section of the Club was officially opened by Lieutenant Governor Sir William Irvine on 21 August 1926."
In 1934 club member 28-year-old Freda Thompson flew her DH Moth Major solo from England to Australia in 19 days – the first Australian women fly the route (also notable for her record 5 hr flight from Koepang to Darwin). Freda Thompson was Club President in 1948.
"Operations were somewhat limited during the Second World War, and Essendon Airport subsequently became the primary commercial airport for Melbourne, the increased airliner traffic limiting private operations. Thus, in December 1949 the Club transferred to and became the first operator on what were once market-gardens on Centre Dandenong Road, at the newly established Moorabbin Airport, southeast of the city. A massive growth in the number of flying hours took place in the 1950s and 1960s, aided in part by a Commonwealth Government edict providing some subsidies for private flying training."
The Foundation Members of the Royal Victorian Aero Club were:
Some of those who played a vital role in Club flying operations and who have trained thousands of Australian aviators include:
"Laurie McPherson, Instructor 1950–1951. CFI 1952–1960, 1969–1970 and Manager 1961–1968 and 1978–1985. Pilot who conducted tests on behalf of the Australian Department of Civil Aviation to closely examine the spinning characteristics of the DHC Chipmunk."
"John Lindsay, Honorary Life Member, one-time CFI and manager and pre-eminent club member from 1945 to 2007."
"H Owen Jones, an employee for 42 years."
"Roy F Goon, first flew with RVAC in 1933, flew CAC Boomerang aircraft during Second World War in Darwin and Gove (Sqdn. Ldr. 83 Sqdn). Commanding Officer of l l l MFCU at Labuan. He held this position from 14 February 1943 to 7 September 1945 and was a test pilot with the RAAF, Commonwealth Aircraft Factory and Royal Flying Doctor Service. Held Commercial Pilot Licence No 511 and was an Instructor at the RVAC for 40 years and Chief Flying Instructor in 1977. Goon was a member of the well-known Chinese-Australian family from Ballarat, Victoria."
"George Campbell referred to by pioneer aviatrix Nancy Bird-Walton as """"a man who became a great trainer of pilots in the last war years."""
The Royal Victorian Aero Club provides aircraft and facilities for pilot training and private flying at Moorabbin Airport.
The Club currently trains pilots from various overseas countries and also offers an annual Scholarship as well as fly-aways and regular competitions.
"Additionally, the club (with the RAAF Roulettes as Patron) operates the Young Eagles programme for Victorians between 12 and 17 years of age, designed to introduce flying to potential aviators."
In the boom times of the 1950s much of the training and private flying was undertaken in the legendary De Havilland Moth series of aircraft (primarily the de Havilland Tiger Moth).
"The De Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunk and Victa Airtourer were used in the 1960s followed subsequently by a limited number of Beechcraft aircraft and in much greater numbers, the reliable Piper Aircraft and Cessna, current models of which remain the backbone of the fleet today."

It forms at the same time the southern part of the ring of motorways around Düsseldorf. It includes a pedestrian and cyclist strip."
"This bridge opened in 1979 and eliminated a considerable amount of transit traffic south of Düsseldorf and the South Bridge (B 1), both then the only southern access from the left bank of the Rhine to Düsseldorf. Also, it connected the A 46 with the A 57. The Flehe Bridge has in each direction three vehicle lanes and a hard shoulder. The bridge does not cross the Rhine in a right angle, in order to preserve the area of water procurement of the old water company Flehe. A remarkable feature of the Flehe bridge is the reinforced concrete suspension tower, which looks like a Ypsilon turned on its head. In the handles of the pylons an elevator and stairs are accommodated above the roadway. The handles are in bridge longitudinal direction only broad. They were manufactured with a climbing formwork.

= = = Rappbode Dam = = =
"The Rappbode Dam () is the largest dam in the Harz region as well as the highest dam in Germany. Together with several other dams and retention basins, it forms the flood protection system for the eastern Harz."
"The earliest discussions about building flood protection barriers took place following devastating floods at the beginning of the 20th century. These envisaged a number of masonry dams being constructed across the tributaries of the Bode river. The first concrete plan, however, was to build just one dam but this would have meant sacrificing a number of villages. The eventual project work was completed in 1938 and proposed a plan which avoided flooding any of localities by constructing a number of dams. Construction on the Rappbode Valley Dam began in 1938. Construction was halted due to the war in 1942. After 1945, the newly founded East Germany, the project got under way again and was extended by including the treatment of drinking water, the original layout being retained and the technology being adapted. The foundation stone was laid on 1 September 1952 and, on 7 October 1959, the dam went into service. It was reconstructed between 2000 and 2003 and the national emblems of East Germany on the inscriptions at the tunnel exit of the road across the dam were removed. The two inscriptions on the left and on the right read:"
"The barrier is a straight gravity dam, which holds the water back by its sheer weight. It was built in several sections and finished in 1959. It is high and long. In recent years (before 2002) the crest of the dam was renewed. The roadway and the concrete had weathered and could no longer handle the weight of traffic. The lake behind the dam acts primarily as a reserve drinking water reservoir for the towns east of the Harz. The pressure pipes go to Aschersleben, Halberstadt, Bernburg (Saale), Halle (Saale) and even Leipzig. Its water quality is particularly good; water hardness averages 3° on the German hardness scale. So the water is ideal for use for steam generation and washing. The reservoir also contributes to generation of hydro-electric power to a small extent."
"Mark Major (born March 20, 1970 in Toronto, Ontario) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey left winger. He was drafted 25th overall by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the National Hockey League's 1988 entry draft. Major acquired many penalty minutes over his career due to his playing style, which involved battling in front of the net for loose pucks, scoring garbage goals, and blocking the goaltenders view. Major only played in two NHL games, for the Detroit Red Wings. He also enjoyed a short career as a professional roller hockey player in Roller Hockey International (RHI). Taking into account all of his hockey games played at a professional level, Major played in 1,339 games and acquired 4,334 penalty minutes, giving Major an average of 3.24 penalty minutes per game during his career. After 4 seasons and 2 Championships as Head Coach of the Amherstview Jets Junior A team, Major is taking a year off to help coach his daughter's Kingston Ice Wolves' Peewee AA team."
"Major started receiving attention from NHL scouts while playing for the Don Mills Flyers of the MTHL in 1986. He advanced to the North Bay Centennials of the Ontario Hockey League for the 1987–88 season and put up 33 points in 57 games to go along with a whopping 272 penalty minutes (PIM). Major averaged almost 5 penalty minutes a game, but his hard-nosed style was admired by NHL scouts and Major was selected 25th overall by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the 1988 NHL Draft. Now as an NHL prospect, Major gained confidence and began the 1988–89 season again with the Centennials before being traded 11 games in to the Kingston Raiders. He would remain in Kingston for that season and the next (when they were renamed the Kingston Frontenacs), scoring 112 points and 361 PIMs, before moving up to the Muskegon Lumberjacks of the International Hockey League. Major remained with the Lumberjacks for three seasons, scoring 77 points and 617 PIMs. He led the team in penalties during the 1991–92 season with 302 and would add another 29 PIMs in the Lumberjacks' playoff run which saw them lose four games to none in the finals to the Kansas City Blades. After his last season with the Lumberjacks, that included a relocation to Cleveland, Major was let go by the parent club Pittsburgh and quickly signed as a free agent by the Boston Bruins on July 22, 1993."
"Major started play with Boston's affiliate the Providence Bruins of the American Hockey League. He scored 26 points along with 176 PIMs during the 1993–94 season, but Providence failed to make the playoffs. He was let go by the Bruins, and joined the Detroit Vipers of the IHL for the following season. He continued to play aggressively, with his 36 points and 229 PIMs helping push the Vipers into the playoffs, but his play couldn't help them past the second round."
"Major again caught the attention of an NHL team, when the Detroit Red Wings signed him as a free agent on June 26, 1995. He began play for the Adirondack Red Wings of the AHL in the 1995–96 season and scored 29 points while racking up 234 PIMs for second on the team. He was known as a player who wouldn't back down from a fight, and he was involved in several fights during Adirondack's short playoff run that season, receiving 21 PIMs in just three games."
"Major finally received his first shot in the big leagues during the 1996–97 NHL season when he was brought up from Adirondack for two games starting on November 2, 1996. In his very first game, halfway though the second period, Major fought veteran instigator Tie Domi of the Toronto Maple Leafs. Major held his own against Domi but was rewarded with a bloody nose and a five-minute major. Major played the following night and failed to impress the Detroit staff, which resulted in him being sent back down to the minors. Finishing the season with Adirondack, and leading the team in PIMs with 213, Major was let go by Detroit."
"Major still had NHL interest and was quickly signed as a free agent on August 20, 1997 by the Washington Capitals. He started out in their farm system playing for the Portland Pirates of the AHL. In his first season, Major was first on his team and second in the league for penalty minutes with 355. This was his career high for PIMs in a season and as of 2007, he still holds the team record for penalty minutes in a single season. Major wasn't finished with 355 and added 52 more PIMs in 10 playoff games that year. The following season he again led the team in PIMs and saw his point production decrease to only nine points in 66 games. He was let go by Washington and began play for the Houston Aeros of the IHL in 1999. After just 20 games (with 81 PIMs), Major was signed as a free agent by the Flint Generals of the United Hockey League. He was named team captain and finished out the 1999–00 season with the Generals scoring 41 points, his highest point total in years, and helped the team win the Colonial Cup. He put up great numbers the following season when he finished with 46 points and 163 PIMs. Generals coach Billy Thurlow had this to say about Major's style of play:"
"Anytime he's on the ice, people have to respect us. Nobody's going to shove us around."
"He would also go on to join the AHL's Hershey Bears for two games in the 2000–01 season. In 2001, he joined the Wheeling Nailers of the East Coast Hockey League and would go on to score 84 points in two seasons with the Nailers. The coach, John Brophy, had this to say about Major returning for his second season in Wheeling:"
"We are very fortunate to have Mark return to the Nailers, not only are we getting a great player and a natural team leader, but a guy who is good in the community and represents the Nailers and Penguins organizations with class."
"The 2003–04 season would be Major's last, playing in 40 games for the Laval Chiefs of the QSMHL and 12 games for the Kalamazoo Wings of the UHL."
"Major was also an active member in the Roller Hockey International League for its entire lifespan. Major played on the Buffalo Stampede in 1994 and 1995, winning the Murphy Cup in 1994. He joined the Empire State Cobras in 1996 and the New Jersey Rockin' Rollers in 1997. When the RHI folded in 1997, Major continued playing with the Buffalo Wings of Major League Roller Hockey in 1998 and joined the newly re-formed Roller Hockey International with Buffalo in 1999. The league folded for good after the 1999 season."

He had been told that Breenberg was born in Utrecht and had been a master of Cornelis van Poelenburgh, which he knew to be impossible from the facts that he already had, namely ""the birth of Poelenburg in 1586 and the death of Breenberg in 1660."" Houbraken never received the information he requested, though he mentioned Breenbergh again in his second volume in a list of 59 competent painters who were contemporaries of Abraham Bloemaert and Paulus Potter."
"Äccording to the Netherlands Institute for Art History (RKD), Breenbergh was born in the Netherlands town of Deventer, but after the death of his father in 1607 moved away with the rest of his family, probably to Hoorn. There he was a contemporary of Jacques Waben and possibly received his first training, though his first teacher is now supposed to be ""one of those many forgotten Amsterdam landscape painters of the 1610s"". His registered teachers are Pieter Lastman and Jacob Symonsz Pynas."
"Breenbergh is first registered as a painter on an archival record in 1619 in Amsterdam, though he possibly was established there earlier."
"In the same year he left for Rome. There he lived and worked with the Flemish painter Frans van de Kasteele and was heavily influenced by another Fleming resident, the landscape painter Paul Bril. From 1623, however, he came under the spell of Italian landscapes by the somewhat older Cornelis van Poelenburgh—indeed, the works of Breenbergh and van Poelenburgh are sometimes difficult to tell apart. He was also influenced by Nicolaes Moeyaert. Breenbergh in his turn influenced the French landscape-painter Claude Lorrain (who arrived in the city about 1620). In about 1620 Breenbergh became one of the founders of the Roman society of Dutch and Flemish painters, the ""Bentvueghels"", among whom he was nicknamed ""het fret"" (""the ferret"")."
"The #19 engine, also known as the ""Lew Brown"", features a propane-fired boiler and has a total weight of 25 tons (engine and tender). Like its older brother engine, the #12, it is a scale replica of The General. The engine is painted green and was originally named Simon Kenton, after a famous Ohio frontiersman."
"Kings Island maintains a total of 12 open air passenger cars, arranged as 6 cars on each engine. 6 of the cars are painted green, and are typically matched with the No. 19 engine. The other 6 cars are painted red, and are matched with the No. 12 engine. Capacity per completed train (6 cars) is 465 park guests. Each passenger car has a series of seals depicting Native American Tecumseh and frontiersman Simon Kenton (after whom the engines were originally named) with the railroad name."
"The Kings Island & Miami Valley Railroad features two train stations. Losantiville station is considered the line's main station, and is located in the Rivertown section of the park, next to the entrance of White Water Canyon and Mystic Timbers. It is a covered station and platform. There is also a station located at the entrance to Soak City Water park, which is an uncovered concrete pad station that, unlike the Losantiville station, is a curved station."
"Each train is manned by a total of four associates; an Engineer, Fireman, Front Conductor, and Back Conductor (position of back conductor may be eliminated with the operation of a scaled down train of three passenger cars, rather than the regular six). The Engineer is in charge of the operation of the locomotive, while the Fireman watches over the boiler pressure levels, and maintains the fire and water levels in the boiler. The Front Conductor is in the charge of the movement of the train, as well as the entertainment and wellbeing of the passengers aboard. Additionally, each station must be manned by a Station Master who is responsible for the safety of passengers in the station, helping passengers load and unload, as well as keeping capacity."
"Each morning, the train crew (Engineer and Fireman) prepare the engines for operation at the engine house, located near the Losantiville station. Once the first train of the morning reaches the Losantiville station, the front conductor and back conductor board the train. Once the train is staffed completely, the train must do a full test cycle around the track before passengers can be loaded. During the morning hours, only one engine is in service. Midway through the day, the second train is brought into operation. Opening procedures for the train brought out second differ slightly, in that the front and back conductors board the train in the engine house, rather than at the Losantiville station."
"The Front Conductor is in charge of the movement of the train. During a normal passenger loading procedure, the station master must clear the station platform with a thumbs up signal, at which point the Back Conductor must clear the Front Conductor for movement with a hand signal known as a ""Highball"". Once the Front Conductor verifies the Highball from the Back Conductor and the clear from the Station Master, the Front Conductor will ""Highball"" the Engineer, who then proceeds with operation of the locomotive. ""Highball"" hand signals are also given at two locations along the train route, between the Front and Back Conductor, to signal that everything is clear on all six passenger cars."
"After the water park closes, the park resumes one-train operation for the rest of the night. The last train leaves at park closing and backs the train into the locomotive garage (engine house). After the last cycle has completed for the night, the Engineer and Fireman proceed to back the other train into the engine house from the Losantiville station."
"The Kings Island & Miami Valley Railroad has some private grade crossings for the private roads where the workers go on. The private grade crossings have one or two crossbucks. There is also a public grade crossing that has four railroad crossing signals, two gated signals with bells and lights for the public path and two gateless signals with just lights for the private road. This crossing is right next to the Soak City station."
"The Kings Island & Miami Valley Railroad operates during the entire season. Throughout most of the season, it entertains guests and serves as transportation to and from Soak City. During the park's annual Halloween Haunt event, which occurs on weekend nights in September and October, it was transformed into a haunted maze known as ""Tombstone Terror-Tory"". The attraction had a western-theme and utilized the exit path of White Water Canyon. When Kings Island began construction of Mystic Timbers in 2016, the exit path was shortened significantly, and Tombstone Terror-Tory was removed from the Halloween Haunt lineup."

"Robert Hoxie Rutford (Jan. 26,1933-Dec. 1, 2019) was a President Emeritus and a former faculty member of the University of Texas at Dallas. He was the second President of the University of Texas at Dallas (from 1982 until 1994)."
He has been noted for his geological research on Antarctica.
"Rutford was a member of several United States Antarctic Program expeditions to Antarctica, and was the leader of the University of Minnesota Ellsworth Mountains Party, 1963–1964. Rutford served as Director of the Division of Polar Programs of the National Science Foundation from 1975 to 1977."
"The 14,688 foot/4,477 meter-high Mount Rutford, which is the summit of Craddock Massif in the Sentinel Range of the Ellsworth Mountains in the Antarctic, was named for him in 2007. The 130 mile-long Rutford Ice Stream, a ""mile-thick, fast flowing stream"" which drains part of the West Antarctic ice sheet into the sea, had previously been named for him."
"Rutford served as the head football coach at Hamline University in St. Paul, Minnesota from 1958 to 1961."
= = = Galwan River = = =
"The Galwan River flows from the disputed Aksai Chin region in southern Hotan County, Hotan Prefecture, Xinjiang of China to Ladakh of India. It originates in the area of Samzungling on the eastern side of the Karakoram range and flows west to join the Shyok River at . It is one of the upstream tributaries of the Indus River."
"The river is named after Ghulam Rasool Galwan, a Ladakhi explorer from Leh, who first explored the course of the river. In 1899, he was part of a British expedition team that was exploring the areas to the north of the Chang Chenmo valley, when ran into this previously unknown river valley. Harish Kapadia states that this is one of the rare instances where a major geographical feature is named after a native explorer."
"The river's length is about 80 kilometers, and it is fast-flowing."
"The Galwan river is to the west of China's 1956 claim line in Aksai Chin. However, in 1960 China advanced its claim line to the west of the river along the mountain ridge adjoining the Shyok river valley. Meanwhile, India continued to claim the entire Aksai Chin plateau."
"These claims and counterclaims led to a military standoff in the Galwan River valley in 1962. On 4 July, a platoon of Indian Gorkha troops set up a post in the upper reaches of the valley. The post ended up cutting the lines of communication to a Chinese post at Samzungling. The Chinese interpreted it as a premeditated attack on their post, and surrounded the Indian post, coming within 100 yards of the post. The Indian government warned China of ""grave consequences"" and informed them that India was determined to hold the post at all costs. The post remained surrounded for four months and was supplied by helicopters. According to scholar Taylor Fravel, the standoff marked the ""apogee of tension"" for China's leaders."
"By the time the Sino-Indian War started on the 20 October 1962, the Indian post had been reinforced by a company of troops. The Chinese PLA bombarded it with heavy shelling and employed a battalion to attack the post. The Indians suffered 33 killed and several wounded, and the company commander and several others were taken prisoner. By the end of the war, China reached its 1960 claim line."
"The Chinatown stop is located on George Street, north of Campbell Street. It is named after Sydney's Chinatown precinct. The Capitol Square stop on the Dulwich Hill Line is nearby. The design was to include two side platforms, but was changed to an island platform in the project's Submissions Report. The location was also moved 15 metres north."
"The Haymarket stop, known as Rawson Place during development, serves as an interchange for buses heading towards the west via Broadway. The design includes two side platforms for trams and an adjacent platform for buses, which allows bus – tram cross-platform transfers."
"The Central Chalmers Street stop is located on Chalmers Street, serving the eastern side of the Central railway station precinct. The stop was originally known simply as Central during development, but was renamed to distinguish it from the existing Central stop on the Dulwich Hill Line at the station's Grand Concourse. The new stop consists of one side platform and one island platform."
"The stop was originally proposed to consist of three double length (90 metre) platforms, with one of the platforms to only be used during special events - the roadway being open to general traffic at other times. This third platform was removed in the project's Submissions Report, with a crossover to the north of the stop provided instead. The Report also proposed diverting most general traffic via Randle Street and converting the section of Chalmers Street opposite the station into a pedestrian/traffic shared zone. As a result of the December 2014 decision to increase the length of the trams, plans to run double length trams during special events at Moore Park were abandoned. Consequently, the Modifications Report reduced the platform length from 90 metres to 75 metres. The third platform was reinstated in an urban design plan released in 2017. This report also proposed closing Chalmers Street to through traffic."
"The Surry Hills stop is located on Devonshire Street, adjacent to Ward Park in Surry Hills. The design originally featured an island platform but was changed to side platforms in the project's Submissions Report. Groundwork for a second Surry Hills stop at Wimbo Park for a potential future station if required will be completed in the initial construction phase."
"The Moore Park stop serves the Moore Park precinct. In regular service the stop serves Sydney Boys High School, Sydney Girls High School and The Entertainment Quarter. The stop is also designed to handle major events at the New Sydney Football Stadium and Sydney Cricket Ground, with grade separated access to the platform. At-grade access to the stop will be provided for regular use and for disabled passengers during major events. The design features a 75-metre island platform."
"The stop's design experienced a number of modifications. Initially, an overhead concourse was proposed for access to the stop during special events with at-grade access at other times. School students would have used the existing footpath and pedestrian crossing of Anzac Parade."
"In the project's Submissions Report, the stop was moved 250 metres south and a pedestrian bridge over Anzac Parade and the light rail tracks was included in the design, replacing an existing at-grade crossing of the road and an associated set of traffic lights. The bridge was to be connected to the concourse. In December 2014, the overhead concourse was removed, with underground access for major events provided at both ends of the platform. At-grade access will be used by disabled passengers during major events and by all passengers at other times. The bridge will now be a separate structure. As a result of the decision to increase the length of the trams, plans to run double length trams during major events were abandoned. Consequently, the platform length was reduced from 90 metres to 75 metres."
"Community submissions responding to the changes in the Modifications Report raised concerns about the safety of a large number of school students crossing the tracks during peak schools hours. In response, TfNSW stated that it will consider opening the subways during these hours. A condition of approval for the changes proposed in the Modifications Report requires the preparation of ""a safety case demonstrating, to the satisfaction of the Office of the National Rail Safety Regulator, that schoolchildren can safely access the Moore Park stop during peak school start and finish times""."
"Royal Randwick, known as Alison Road and then Royal Randwick Racecourse during development, is located on existing park land adjacent to Centennial Park on Alison Road, opposite the racecourse. This required the construction of a new retaining wall approximately 200 metres long and three metres high together with increasing the height of an existing 1,100-metre long levee by up to 300 millimetres and the removal of approximately 50 established trees."
"The design features an island platform. The proposed location was switched from the south side to the north side of Alison Road in December 2014. This is intended to reduce impacts on the racecourse, improve bus access during major events and provide better access to the nearby Centennial Park and Randwick TAFE. This change includes the removal of right turn access from Alison Road into Darley Road."
"The Wansey Road stop is located on Alison Road, adjacent to the intersection with Wansey Road. The design features an island platform and was originally to be located on Wansey Road itself, but was moved to Alison Road in the project's Submissions Report. The stop was originally proposed to be named Wansey Stables."
"The UNSW High Street stop serves the north-eastern part of the University of New South Wales campus. It was to have been located at the southern end of Wansey Road, adjacent to High Street, but was moved onto High Street itself as part of the project's Submissions Report. As part of the changes to the Randwick stop, the design was changed from an island platform to two side platforms."
"The Randwick stop is located the eastern end of High Street in Randwick. The stop was originally proposed to be named Randwick Junction. The design features an island platform. The site will be a major interchange between buses and light rail. Bus stops are proposed for Belmore Road, Avoca Street and Clara Street."
"The original design featured two side platforms located in High Cross Park adjacent to Belmore Road. This location attracted criticism from community members due to loss of trees and parkland. The stop was redesigned in the project's Submissions Report to reduce the loss of green space in the park, however a campaign to move the stop continued. Randwick City Council requested the stop be moved to High Street, outside the Prince of Wales Hospital and TfNSW ultimately agreed to do this. A location within High Cross Park was considered to provide the best interchanges between trams and buses."
"ES Marks, known as Carlton Street during development, will be located on Anzac Parade south of the intersection with Carlton Street. The stop will serve a residential area. It is named after the nearby ES Marks Athletics Field. The design features an island platform."
"Kensington, known as Todman Avenue during development, will be located on Anzac Parade north of the intersection with Todman Avenue. The stop serves a residential area and a shopping strip on Anzac Parade in the suburb of Kensington. The design features an island platform."
"UNSW Anzac Parade serves the western part of the University of New South Wales campus and the National Institute of Dramatic Art. The design includes an island platform in the centre of Anzac Parade, north of the University Mall."
"The stop was to be located on the eastern side of Anzac Parade and include one island platform and one side platform – though only two tracks. In the project's Submissions Report, the side platform was removed and the stop was moved to the centre of Anzac Parade."
"The Kingsford stop, known as Strachan Street during development, will be located on Anzac Parade to the south of the intersection of Strachan Street and Middle Street in Kingsford. The stop serves a residential area and a shopping strip on Anzac Parade. The design features an island platform."
"Juniors Kingsford, originally Nine Ways and known as Kingsford during development, will be located on the southern side of the Nine Ways intersection in Kingsford. The design features two island platforms with the light rail using the two outer platforms and buses using the two inner platforms, providing cross-platform transfers. Terminating facilities for trams are located south of the stop. In August 2018 TfNSW submitted a proposal with the Geographical Names Board for the stop to be renamed from Nine Ways to Juniors Kingsford which was approved in January 2019."
"In 2014, TfNSW investigated an extension along the southern Anzac Parade corridor. Three potential options were examined; a 1.9 kilometre extension to Maroubra Junction, a 5.1 kilometre extension to Malabar and an 8.2 kilometre extension to La Perouse. An extension to Maroubra Junction has the support of Randwick City Council."

This species was discovered in northeastern Cambodia in the Van Sai Protected Forest. They have tube-shaped nostrils (hence the name) which assist them with their feeding."
"Walston's bat is one of 126 new species found in the Greater Mekong region during 2011. There were two other tube-nosed bats found in Southeast Asia in 2011: Ashy-gray tube-nosed bat (""Murina cineracea"") and Beelzebub's tube-nosed bat (""Murina beelzebub""). All three species are small for bats and ""M. walstoni"" is small for a ""Murina"" bat. These three new tube-nosed bats were discovered by a team from the Hungarian Natural History Museum (HNHM) and Fauna and Flora International (FFI). All three of these bats live in tropical forests, making them endangered by deforestation."
= = = Convoy HX 112 = = =
"HX 112 was a North Atlantic convoy of the HX series which ran during the battle of the Atlantic in the Second World War. It was notable in that it saw the loss of U-boats commanded by two of the Kriegsmarine's (KM) foremost U-boat aces, with ""Korvettenkapitän"" Otto Kretschmer (POW) and with ""Kapitänleutnant"" Joachim Schepke (KIA)."
"HX 112 was an east-bound convoy of ships which sailed from Halifax on 1 March 1941, making for Liverpool with war materials. Many of the ships in HX 112 were tankers carrying fuel oil to Britain."
"It was escorted by 5th Escort Group which consisted of two destroyers, and and two corvettes, and was led by Commander Donald Macintyre of HMS ""Walker"". 5th Escort Group was reinforced on this occasion by an additional two destroyers, in view of the importance of the cargo, and met the convoy as it entered the Western Approaches."
"On 15 March 1941 HX 112 was sighted by commanded by Fritz-Julius Lemp, who sent in a sighting report and commenced shadowing the convoy. He was joined throughout the day by four other boats; ""U-99"" (Kretschmer) ""U-100"" (Schepke) (Clausen) and (Kentrat)."
"On the night of 15th/16th the attack started; ""U-100"" was able to torpedo a tanker, which burst into flames, but survived to reach port; all other attacks that night were frustrated by the activities of the escorts."
"Keeping up with the convoy on the surface during the day, the pack tried again as night fell on the 16th."
"""U-99"" managed to penetrate the convoy from the north, on its port side, and sank four tankers and a freighter in under an hour. Remaining with the central column of the convoy she sank another freighter 15 minutes later before making her getaway."
"Meanwhile, the escorts, searching for U-boats outside the convoy perimeter, found ""U-100"" around 1.30am moving in on the surface. She dived, but ""Walker"" attacked with a depth charge pattern at close range. ""U-100"" evaded further damage, and surfaced, to be sighted and rammed by ""Vanoc"" just after 3am; Schepke was killed when ""Vanoc"" smashed into his periscope structure and ""U100"" went down with most of her crew."
"As this was happening, ""U-99"" was making her escape; she nearly collided with a destroyer in the dark and dived. Picked up on ASDIC by ""Walker"", she was depth-charged and severely damaged. Saving ""U-99"" from being crushed as she sank deeper and deeper, Kretschmer brought her to the surface, where she was fired on by the encircling warships. ""U-99"" was sunk, but Kretschmer and most of his crew were saved, to be taken prisoner."
There were no further attacks on HX.112 and the convoy arrived in Liverpool on 20 March.
"A total of 41 merchant vessels joined the convoy, either in Halifax or later in the voyage."
A series of armed military ships escorted the convoy at various times during its journey.
"HX.112 had lost six ships totalling 50,000 tons. However, the loss of two of the Kriegsmarine's U-boat aces, one of which was the highest scoring submarine commander of the Second World War, was a severe blow to the Kriegsmarine offensive. The defence of HX.112, coupled with the successful defence of Convoy OB 293 and the loss of U-boat ace Günther Prien along with his sub the previous week, marked a minor turning point in the Atlantic campaign."
= = = The Return of Count Yorga = = =
"The Return of Count Yorga (originally titled Yorga Returns) is a 1971 American vampire horror film directed by Bob Kelljan and starring Robert Quarry. It is the sequel to the 1970 film ""Count Yorga, Vampire""."
"The story features Quarry returning as the infamous vampire Count Yorga, along with his servant Brudah, both of whom have been revived by the supernatural Santa Ana winds. Actor Roger Perry, who had a lead role in the first film, appears again but as a different character."
"Cynthia Nelson (Mariette Hartley), a teacher at the local orphanage, talks with a pastor while watching the sun set before getting ready for a fundraising costume party. Cynthia mentions the ""Santa Ana winds"" which the pastor states are an evil omen. One of the orphans, Tommy (Philip Frame), wanders into the nearby cemetery where he faintly hears a voice ordering ""Rise, rise; it is time."" Tommy initially dismisses it, but as he stops to rest, vampire women rise from their graves. Seeing this, Tommy tries to escape the cemetery only to run into the clutches of Count Yorga (Robert Quarry), who is waiting for them."
"Sometime later, Yorga goes to the orphanage during their costume party and fund raiser. Biting one of the pretty guests, Mitzi (Jesse Welles), outside the event room before going inside and introducing himself to those present, among which is Cynthia whom he becomes infatuated with. When a weakened Mitzi stumbles into the room, he leaves as the others are attending to her. That night, he returns to his manor and a makeshift throne room overlooking several coffins, greeted by Brudda (Edward Walsh), Yorga's hulking facially disfigured valet, and the female vampires from earlier ready to do his bidding. Yorga sends the undead women to Cynthia's house, using mind-control to get Cynthia's family (along with Tommy, who was sleeping over) into the living room before his brides break in and attack them. The family is quickly overrun with Cynthia's mother, father and sister, Ellen (Karen Ericson), fed upon by the undead horde. Tommy is untouched, showcasing he is under Yorga's power while Cynthia herself is subdued, but unharmed and carried by the brides to Yorga's residence where she awakens. Due to Yorga's hypnotic suggestions, she has no memory of the attack. Yorga tells Cynthia that there was a car accident and she was left in his care by her family. He tries to charm the young woman into willingly becoming his bride, though he is warned by his live-in witch that Cynthia will bring his end if he does not kill her or turn her into a vampire soon."
"The next morning, Jennifer (Yvonne Wilder), the Nelsons' mute maid, finds the massacre scene and calls the police. However, as she does, Brudda drags the corpses of Cynthia's mother and father to a quicksand pit on Yorga's property, disposing of the physical evidence. By the time the police arrive though, all of the evidence has been mysteriously cleared away, and Tommy claims that nothing has happened. Despite the confusion, David Baldwin (Roger Perry), Cynthia's fiancé, is suspicious about the Nelsons' disappearance. Meanwhile, memories of the attack on her family slowly start to resurface in Cynthia's mind as she stays within Yorga's manor. Jennifer, suspicious about Tommy's involvement with the Nelson's disappearance and his visits to Yorga's mansion, loses her patience and slaps Tommy who stares at her in a vengeful manner. Meanwhile, Yorga goes to claim Mitzi, killing her boyfriend near their boat house before feeding on her once more, this time finishing draining her completely and adding her to his vampiric harem."
"Hours later, Ellen's fiancé Jason (David Lampson) is lured to Yorga's mansion by Tommy, on the claim that he found Ellen. Once at the mansion, Tommy disappears, while Jason is reunited with Ellen who has clearly been made into a vampire by Yorga. As she mocks him for ""not loving her anymore"" and soon starts laughing cruelly at him when he sense something wrong, her fellow brides attack Jason from behind. Jason breaks free, only to run into Count Yorga, who chases Jason down a hall and strangles him. Bruddah tosses Jason's body into the throne/coffin room for the brides, including Ellen and newly vampiric Mitzi, to feed upon."
"That evening, Reverend Thomas (Tom Toner) phones Jennifer, but it is revealed she lies dead on her bed with a large knife sticking out of her chest. From her window, Tommy can be seen walking away from the house. After Thomas learns (off camera) of Jennifer's death, David is sure he is correct about the Count's true nature and manages to convince Reverend Thomas and investigating police detectives Lt. Madden (Rudy De Luca) and Sgt. O'Connor (Craig T. Nelson) to join him in a rescue-mission at Yorga's mansion. Reverend Thomas is sent to distract Yorga while Baldwin, Madden and O'Connor sneak in to search the manor, armed with sticks they can cross and hold up to ward off the vampires. Meanwhile, the pastor falls for Yorga's charms and reveals the others' suspicions that he is a vampire, alerting Yorga of danger. Thomas is tricked into walking into the quicksand pit and promptly sinks to his death. Yorga returns to the manor, awakens his brides and unleashes them through the household as he psychically calls Cynthia to him."
"Baldwin splits from the detectives to expand the room-by-room search, and upon opening one door discovers Jason's corpse, covered in bloody bite marks with an IV draining remaining blood from his neck into a glass-bottle on the floor beneath him. Later, Baldwin finally finds the half-mind-controlled Cynthia and attempts to escape; however, he is nearly beaten by Brudda. Falling into a suit of armor, Baldwin grabs a metal mace and knocks Brudda out with a violent blow to the face."
"Meanwhile, Madden and O'Connor come across Yorga's vampire brides. When the women don't respond to their question and continue tho silently advance on them. the detectives attempt to shoot them point blank, but their bullets prove ineffective as the undead women continue to give chase. In the midst of their escape, they encounter Brudda and managed to shoot him to death. Eventually O'Connor is separated in the brides' throne/coffin room by a shutter and immediately attacked from behind and bitten by the witch (also a vampire) as Madden helplessly listens to O'Connor's death-screams. Madden tries to find a way to him, but lured in by a voice from the shadows (thinking it is Baldwin) and killed by Tommy who stabs him in the same way he murdered Jennifer."
"Baldwin and Cynthia are the only ones left alive, with Yorga supernaturally mocking Baldwin throughout the estate. Yorga seals their exit routes while his brides slowly close in on the two. They duck into a darken hallway, but when Baldwin turns on the lights, he finds himself confronted by all the brides (including Ellen and Mitzi) with Yorga behind them who calls Cynthia over to his side. Yorga takes her away preparing to transform her into a new bride, while leaving his army of brides to finish off Baldwin. He is about to take her when he hears Baldwin scream his name who seemingly have escaped the brides. Yorga takes Cynthia and flees to upper balcony of the estate as Baldwin (who grabs an iron battle-axe from a wall) chases the two. Yorga and Baldwin fight with Baldwin surprisingly seeming stronger than before, however Yorga gains the advantage. Just as he is about to kill Baldwin via choking, Cynthia's memories of the brides killing her family resurfaces, causing her to realize Yorga was responsible for their deaths. She strikes Yorga in the chest with Baldwin's battle-axe. With Yorga stunned by the action, Baldwin uses the moment to throw Yorga off the balcony, and he lies motionless on the pavement below, dead."
"Cynthia hugs Baldwin, believing the ordeal over. However, she notices something wrong and pulls away. To her horror, she sees that Baldwin skin has turned pale and bite marks on his face revealing he was has transformed into a vampire) having apparently not escaped from the brides unscathed). Cynthia tries to run from him, but Baldwin pulls her back and promptly bites her."
"The last shot of the movie is Tommy playing with his ball in front of the orphanage accompanied by a haunting rendition of the song the children sang at the beginning of the film. Though Yorga is dead, his evil lives on as those who know of him are either dead or turned into vampires and will carry out his curse. The film ends with the ominous implication that Cynthia has joined them, Baldwin now their new leader and the surviving vampires are resting within the manor, where they will proceed to spread the vampirisim to the unwitting orphanage and soon to the rest of the town."
"In one scene, Yorga is seen watching a Spanish-language version of ""The Vampire Lovers"" on his television."
"Mitch McDeere (Tom Cruise) is a young man from an impoverished background, but with a promising future as a lawyer. About to graduate from Harvard Law School near the top of his class, he receives a generous job offer from Bendini, Lambert & Locke, a small boutique firm in Memphis specializing in accounting and tax law. He and his wife, Abby (Jeanne Tripplehorn), move to Memphis and Mitch sets to work studying to pass the Tennessee bar exam. Avery Tolar (Gene Hackman), one of the firm's senior partners, becomes his mentor and begins introducing Mitch to BL&L's professional culture, which demands complete loyalty, strict confidentiality, and a willingness to charge exceptional fees for their services. Seduced by the money and perks showered on him (including a house, car, and his student loans paid off), he is at first totally oblivious to the more sinister side of his new employer, although Abby has her suspicions due to the Firm's desire for stability in the family."
"Mitch passes the bar exam and begins working long hours that put a strain on his marriage. Working closely with Tolar, Mitch learns that most of the firm's work involves helping wealthy clients hide large amounts of money in off-shore shell corporations and other dubious tax-avoidance schemes. While on a trip to the Cayman Islands Mitch listens to Tolar talk to client Sonny Capps about taxes and hears Capps state how the firm's clients in Chicago break people's legs. Later on, Mitch is seduced by a local woman and cheats on Abby. Unbeknownst to Mitch, this encounter has been arranged by the firm's sinister security chief, Bill DeVasher (Wilford Brimley), who later uses photos of Mitch's beach tryst with the woman as blackmail to keep him quiet about the firm's questionable, even illegal, activities."
"Mitch realizes he is now trapped, but after he learns four associates of the firm died under mysterious circumstances, he hires private investigator Eddie Lomax to learn the truth. Lomax is shot in his office, which his secretary Tammy witnesses. Mitch is then approached by FBI agents who inform him that, while some of BL&L's business is legitimate, their biggest client is the Morolto Mafia family from Chicago. The firm's partners, as well as most of the associates, are all complicit in a massive tax fraud and money-laundering scheme. The two associates who mostly recently died had learned about the firm's dark side and were killed to keep them from talking, while Lomax was killed for asking questions. The FBI agents warn Mitch that his house, car, and office have probably all been bugged. The FBI pressures Mitch to provide the Bureau with evidence they can use to go after the Moroltos and bring down BL&L."
"Mitch knows he faces a stark choice. If he works with the FBI, he believes that even if he stays alive, he will have to disclose information about the firm's legitimate clients—thus breaking the attorney–client privilege and risking disbarment. However, the FBI warns him that if he stays with the firm, he will almost certainly go to jail when the FBI takes down both the firm and the Moroltos. Either way, his life as he knows it is over, and he agrees to cooperate with the FBI in return for $1.5 million and the release of his imprisoned brother Ray in Arkansas. The FBI release Ray but plan to return him to the slammer once Mitch hands the Feds the files. They also give him half the money before they receive the files. Meanwhile, Mitch confesses to Abby about his one-night stand in the Caymans and she separates herself from him, eventually deciding to leave Memphis."
"Desperate to find a way out of his predicament, Mitch inadvertently stumbles on a solution when one of his clients complains that he was billed for extra several hours of fees, as part of the firm's money-laundering services for the Moroltos. Mailing these padded bills to the firm's clients is considered to be mail fraud, which would expose the firm to RICO charges. Mitch begins secretly copying the firm's billing records with help from Lomax's secretary Tammy, but they need files in Tolar's Cayman house. Meanwhile, Tolar visits Abby at her job to say goodbye, and invites her to come with him to the Caymans. Abby declines, but Tolar reveals his work schedule has changed, thus threatening Mitch's plans. After telling Tammy not to inform Mitch, Abby flies to the Caymans to seduce and drug Tolar. The firm's phone tap picks up Abby's warning to Tammy, and DeVasher sends his hitmen to the Caymans. After Abby and Tammy steal client files from Tolar's house, a drowsy Tolar warns Abby to leave immediately. Tolar is killed by the hitmen."
"Mitch's plans are jeopardized when a prison guard on the Moroltos' payroll alerts DeVasher after Mitch's brother Ray is transferred to FBI custody without the usual formalities being followed. Evading DeVasher and his thugs, Mitch meets with the Morolto brothers and, presenting himself as a loyal attorney looking out for his clients' best interests, tells them that his contact with the FBI and his copying of the firm's files were merely an attempt to expose the firm's illegal overbilling. Mitch asks the Moroltos for permission to turn over their billing invoices in order to help the FBI make their case against the firm. He reveals that he has made his own copies of the files, but assures them that as long as he is alive, any other information he knows about their legal affairs is covered under attorney-client privilege and will never be revealed. Convinced thus, the Moroltos agree to guarantee Mitch's safety and let him give the FBI all the evidence it needs to prosecute the firm. Since the attorney-client privilege doesn't apply when a lawyer knows about ongoing criminal activity, Mitch is able to keep his status as a lawyer."
"The film ends as the McDeeres leave their house in Memphis and return to Boston, driving the same well-used car, an early 1980s Toyota Supra, in which they arrived in Memphis."
"Principal photography took place from November 9, 1992 to March 20, 1993 and though it was primarily filmed in Memphis, Tennessee, some scenes were filmed in Marion, Arkansas and the Cayman Islands."
The film's soundtrack is almost exclusively solo piano by Dave Grusin.
"Gene Hackman's name did not appear on the film's release poster. Hackman joined the film late, when it was already well into production, because the producers had originally wanted to change the gender of the character and cast Meryl Streep, until author John Grisham objected and Hackman was eventually cast. Tom Cruise's deal with Paramount already stated that only his name could appear above the title. Hackman also wanted his name to appear above the credits, but when this was refused he asked for his name to be removed completely from the poster. Hackman's name does appear in the beginning and end credits."
This is also the final film for Steven Hill and John Beal.
"The film accords with the book in most respects, but the ending is significantly different. Mitch does not end up in the Caribbean, as in the book; he and Abby simply get into their car and drive back to Boston, as the ending narration, ""Do you think [the car] will make it?...to Boston?..."""
"A more fundamental difference from the book is the motives and manner in which Mitch solves his predicament. In the book, Mitch acknowledges to himself that he is breaking the attorney-client privilege by copying information and giving it to the FBI. In most US states this privilege only applies to crimes that have already been committed. The privilege does not apply if a lawyer knows that his client either is committing or will commit a crime. However, Mitch must disclose information about his legitimate clients as well. Accepting that he will likely not be allowed to practice law anywhere again, he swindles $10 million from the Firm, along with receiving $1 million of a promised $2 million from the FBI for his cooperation. After an extended manhunt involving the police, the firm's lawyers, and hired thugs from the Morolto family, Mitch escapes with Abby (and his brother Ray) to the Caymans. Before fleeing, he leaves behind detailed records of the firm's illegal activities, as well as a recorded deposition. Mitch's information gives federal prosecutors enough evidence to indict half of the Firm's active lawyers right away, as well as several retired partners. The documents also provide the FBI with circumstantial evidence of the Firm's involvement in money laundering and tax fraud, and thus probable cause for a search warrant for the firm's building and files. This additional evidence is enough to smash both the firm and the Morolto family with a massive RICO indictment."
"In the film, apparently in order to preserve the protagonist's personal integrity, Mitch exposes a systematic overbilling scheme by the firm, thus driving a wedge between the Moroltos (who in essence become complicit with Mitch) and their law firm (in the book, overbilling only received a brief mention). He receives a smaller amount of money from the FBI, which he gives to Ray, allowing him to disappear. Rather than capitalizing on his circumstances by stealing money from the Firm, as in the book, the movie's McDeere ends up battered and bruised, but with his integrity and professional ethics intact. Mitch also makes the FBI have to work in order to bring down the firm by having to argue that each instance of excessive billing is a federal offense (by virtue of the excessive bills being sent through the mail). The volume and frequency meets the criteria for RICO, thereby enabling the FBI to effectively put the Firm out of business by seizing its property and equipment and freezing its bank accounts. From here the Moroltos would then need to find another law firm willing to take them on as clients, and if they couldn't, charges for non-lodgment of tax returns could be brought. Since Mitch is exposing only illegal activity, he is able to retain his law license."
"Instead of a BMW, Mitch gets a Mercedes-Benz for joining the firm."
"Avery Tolar was originally Avery Tolleson; the latest version of the novel uses the film's surname. Tolar is portrayed as a sort of reluctant villain in the film, while in the novel he has no such moral conflicts."
"The surname of the second man killed on Grand Cayman is Joe Hodges, instead of Hodge as in the novel."
"Mitch's confession to Abby about his sexual infidelity was also unique to the film. In the novel, McDeere never tells Abby about his infidelity. In the book, Abby's not knowing about Mitch's infidelity is a major ""suspense"" piece. Mitch comes home one evening and finds an envelope addressed to Abby, that has ""Photos – Do Not Bend"" written on it. The photos were surreptitiously given to DeVasher by Art Germain. Mitch thinks it is the pictures he was shown of his infidelity overseas. Abby is in the bedroom when he sees the open package. He enters the bedroom and learns that Abby opened the package, but it was empty. Mitch realizes DeVasher is toying with him, and this incident in the book causes Mitch to cooperate with the FBI. In the film, Mitch's confession prompts Abby to seriously consider leaving him, but she ultimately helps him bring down the firm."
"Also, in the book, Eddie's old secretary, Tammy, seduces and drugs Avery. In the movie, however, it is Abby who seduces Avery. This also changes the character development because in the movie Abby is portrayed as risking herself for Mitch. In the book, Abby is simply an accomplice to Tammy."
"In the novel, a dirty FBI agent betrays McDeere to let the firm know about the deal. In the movie, a prison guard alerts the firm to Ray McDeere's release, alerting them that Mitch McDeere cut a deal with the FBI."
"Critical reaction to ""The Firm"" has been mostly positive, with the film earning a 75% rating at Rotten Tomatoes based on 55 reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""B+"" on an A+ to F scale."
"Roger Ebert gave ""The Firm"" three stars out of four, remarking: ""The movie is virtually an anthology of good small character performances. [...] The large gallery of characters makes ""The Firm"" into a convincing canvas [... but] with a screenplay that developed the story more clearly, this might have been a superior movie, instead of just a good one with some fine performances."""
"The film earned some negative reviews as well, notably from James Berardinelli, who said that ""[v]ery little of what made the written version so enjoyable has been successfully translated to the screen, and what we're left with instead is an overly-long [and] pedantic thriller."" Grisham enjoyed the film, remarking: ""I thought [Tom Cruise] did a good job. He played the innocent young associate very well."""
"The film was released while Grisham was at the height of his popularity. That week, Grisham and Michael Crichton evenly divided the top six paperback spots on ""The New York Times"" Best Seller list. It opened on June 30, 1993 in 2,393 theatres, and landed at #1 at the box office, grossing $25.4 million over the 4th of July weekend. It remained in the #1 spot at the box office for 3 weeks. After 12 weeks in theatres, the film was a huge success, making over $158 million domestically and $111 million internationally ($270 million worldwide). Additionally, it was the largest grossing R-rated movie of 1993 and of any film based on a Grisham novel."
"The film earned two Academy Award nominations including Best Supporting Actress for Holly Hunter (losing to Anna Paquin for ""The Piano"", though she did win an Oscar at that year's ceremony for Best Actress in the same film as Paquin) and Best Original Score for Dave Grusin (losing to John Williams for ""Schindler's List"")."
"The film was released on VHS in December 1993, the cassettes were specially made of blue plastic. The DVD was released on May 23, 2000. The special features include only the teaser and theatrical trailers. The Blu-ray was released on September 11, 2012."
"In April 2011 Entertainment One announced that a sequel to ""The Firm"" was being produced with Sony Pictures Television and Paramount Pictures. The series picked up the story of Mitch and his family ten years after the events of the novel and film. The first season was 22 episodes long and began production in Canada in July 2011. In May 2011, NBC confirmed that they had acquired the U.S. broadcast rights to the show and that they planned to début it in January 2012. The show was cancelled after its first season."

"Brigham City is a 2001 murder mystery independent film. It was written and directed by Richard Dutcher, who also plays in the main role of Sheriff Wes Clayton. It was financed by private investors."
"Because of the in-movie descriptions of geography and population, it depicts a fictional Utah town of Brigham City rather than the actual town of Brigham City."
"The Chicago Cubs selected Berg in the sixth round, with the 173rd overall selection, of the 2015 MLB Draft. Berg signed and spent 2015 with both the Eugene Emeralds and the Myrtle Beach Pelicans, where he posted a 2–1 record with a 1.40 ERA. In 2016, Berg started the season with Myrtle Beach and was later promoted to the Tennessee Smokies; in 43 total games between both clubs, 4–4 record and a 5.17 ERA. He spent 2017 with Tennessee, Myrtle Beach, and the Iowa Cubs, pitching to a combined 4-4 record and 5.16 ERA with a 1.38 WHIP in a career high 61 innings pitched between the three teams."
"On March 27, 2018, the Cubs released Berg."
"In 2019, Berg returned to UCLA as a pitching coach."

"""Trinity War"" is an 11-issue comic book story arc first published in 2013 by DC Comics, featuring the fictional superhero teams the Justice League, Justice League of America, and Justice League Dark. The arc spans several titles, including ""Justice League"", ""Justice League of America"", ""Justice League Dark"", ""Constantine"", """" and ""Trinity of Sin: The Phantom Stranger"". The story is an action-mystery that sees the Justice League, Justice League of America, and Justice League Dark clash, in order to solve the mystery of Pandora's Box. The event also introduces the Crime Syndicate and the reveal of Earth-3 to The New 52."
"The main storyline received generally positive reviews, though was criticized for not having a true conclusion, instead leading directly into the ""Forever Evil"" storyline; the tie-in titles received mixed reviews. Every title involved in the story was collected into a trade paperback entitled ""Justice League: Trinity War""."
"Pandora appeared in all first issues of the First and Second Wave titles of The New 52. Many of the stories since The New 52 was created at the end of ""Flashpoint"" lead up to ""Trinity War"".<ref name=""Johns/Lemire IGN""></ref> Some of these stories and events include:"
"In the year 8000 BC, Pandora finds the box and inadvertently opens it, unleashing the Seven Sins on the world. As a result, she is punished by the Council of Wizards with immortality. Pandora begins her travels, training and trying to destroy the Seven Sins. In the present, she receives information from the Wizard informing her that the box can only be opened by either the purest or darkest of heart. Pandora approaches Superman to open her box, believing he is 'without sin', but when he touches the box he appears to become possessed. Pandora manages to escape with the box, after which Superman seems to return to normal."
"Shazam, having defeated his arch-enemy Black Adam, journeys to Kahndaq to bury him, inadvertently risking a diplomatic incident. Superman and the Justice League attempt to stop Shazam, which escalates into a fight. Amanda Waller decides it is the perfect opportunity for the Justice League of America to confront the Justice League, and dispatches them. During the conflict, it appears as though Superman murders the JLA's newest recruit, Doctor Light. Seeming to have lost control of his powers, Superman surrenders himself to A.R.G.U.S."
"Wonder Woman, believing that Pandora's box is responsible for Superman's actions, meets with Hephaestus, for answers about the box. She learns that he did not forge it and that Zeus and the other gods used Pandora to open the box because it contained something that the Gods of Olympus could not control. She meets with the Justice League Dark in order to recruit them to track down Pandora. At A.R.G.U.S. headquarters, the Question enters Superman's cell and releases him."
"The Question explains that he has evidence that indicates Doctor Psycho was in Kahndaq when Doctor Light was killed. Superman is physically ill and struggles to control his powers as he and the Question break out of the base to track down Doctor Psycho, with several other heroes in tow. When they confront Doctor Psycho, they determine that although he was present, he was not responsible for what happened in Kahndaq. Meanwhile, Pandora attempts to convince Vandal Savage to open the box, but he is also unable to do so."
"While Batman examines Doctor Light's body, the Phantom Stranger arrives to warn him that should Wonder Woman locate Pandora and the box, it will be the death of all. They confront Wonder Woman and the Justice League Dark at Constantine's House of Mystery, but when Wonder Woman questions the Phantom Stranger about Superman's ailment, the Stranger admits he does not know what caused Superman's condition."
"Batman convinces the Phantom Stranger to bring him to the afterlife so he can question Doctor Light. When Batman questions Doctor Light, the group learns that he does not remember anything about his death. Doctor Light gives a piece of his soul to the Stranger in hopes that he can give it to his family as a final gift. As the group is ready to leave, Zauriel appears, dismisses Batman and Deadman, and follows through on his promise to erase the Phantom Stranger from existence. Wonder Woman and her team track Pandora to the prison where Lex Luthor is held. Pandora approaches Luthor, hoping that he can open the box. Before she can give it to him, Wonder Woman and her group arrive to retrieve the box. Upon touching the box, Wonder Woman is apparently possessed just as Superman was."
"The other superheroes around her attempt to get the box from her and free her from its power; one by one it begins to corrupt them all. Pandora can see the sins above the Justice League members fighting over the box. As the battle continues, Pandora is finally able to attack the Sins, by killing Envy. Constantine takes Shazam out of the area and tricks him into switching off his powers. Constantine then uses a ritual artifact to steal Billy's powers. When he is attacked by an agent of the Cold Flame, Constantine uses the Shazam power, but is unable to control it. Billy Batson distracts the agent, giving Constantine time to kill it, and Billy regains his power. Constantine pleads with Billy not to touch Pandora's box, afraid of the power it may possess, but Shazam leaves Constantine and returns to the group, where he sees the effect the box has had on Wonder Woman. He knocks the box aside and picks it up; the resulting contact corrupts him also, giving him an appearance similar to Black Adam and causing a huge ripple through the magical planes."
"During the conflict, Constantine arrives, takes the box, and transports himself and Zatanna to the Temple of Hephaestus. There they find that Madame Xanadu had been kidnapped and locked away in a secret bunker. Madame Xanadu tells everyone that Pandora had it wrong, that the box is actually a doorway. Superman, Wonder Woman and their respective groups arrive at the temple. Constantine, still in possession of the box, realizes that the box is allowing evil thoughts to go through everyone's mind, and a massive fight breaks out as the heroes struggle to get possession of the box."
"Firestorm tells everyone that Superman is emitting Kryptonite. Element Woman goes inside Superman's blood stream and finds a small sliver in his brain. Atom then tells everyone that she put it there in Kahndaq, and that it was this that has been causing Superman's illness and loss of control of his powers. The Outsider comes out of the shadows to pick up the box. He tells the heroes that the box is not magic, but science, that was created on his world and can only be opened by someone from his world. He explains that the box opens a gateway to his homeworld, and that he and Atom arrived following the weakening of the barriers between the universes resulting from the Justice League's battle with Darkseid."
"The Outsider uses Pandora's box to open a portal to his home world, Earth-3, breaking the box in the process. The Earth-3 incarnation of the Justice League emerge — Ultraman, Superwoman, Owlman, Johnny Quick, Power Ring, and Deathstorm. Sea King does not survive the journey and collapses dead. Atom joins the group, answering to the name Atomica, revealing that she had arrived on Prime Earth along with the Outsider, who is revealed to be the Alfred Pennyworth of Earth-3. Cyborg's Apokoliptical mechanical prosthetics proceed to tear themselves from his body, ripping free from his biological form and coalescing into a robot named Grid, a sentient computer virus. Trailing behind the Crime Syndicate is a prisoner from Earth-3 whose identity is not revealed. The Crime Syndicate claim the planet as their own, and attack the three weakened Justice Leagues."
"The outcome of ""Trinity War"" leads directly into DC's ""Forever Evil"" miniseries and ""Villains Month"" event, as well as the creation of new ""New 52"" titles. ""Trinity of Sin: The Phantom Stranger"" #11 had major repercussions for Phantom Stranger and planted the seeds for a new story arc in ""Trinity of Sin: The Phantom Stranger"" #14, later revealed to be the """" storyline. At San Diego Comic-Con 2013, Johns and Lemire said the events of ""Trinity War"" would affect many of the DC titles, not just the Justice League books."
"The name of the crossover had brought speculation to what the ""Trinity"" stood for. In the 2012 FCBD special, Pandora, the Phantom Stranger and the Question were dubbed the Trinity of Sin. In regards to the name, Geoff Johns stated there was ""a bit of a mystery"" around it saying, ""Is it about the Trinity of Sin? The trinity of Leagues? Is it about Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman? What does ""trinity"" mean? What is it all about? That's something that the story explores."" In ""Justice League"" #23, it is revealed that the ""Trinity"" refers to the true number of evil, three, referencing Earth-3."
"The review aggregator website Comic Book Roundup reported a 7.3 out of 10 average rating for the event, based on 270 critic reviews. Just before the release of the final part, Jesse Schedeen of IGN stated, """"Trinity War"" itself seems almost wholly disinterested in the Trinity of Sin, the Seven Deadly Sins, or any of the other elements the crossover was initially predicated upon."" After ""Justice League"" #23 was released, Schedeen added,""Event comics often fail because they're more concerned with setting up a new status quo and changing the playing field than simply allowing readers to savor the high stakes and epic nature of the conflict at hand. ""Trinity War"" may well emerge as the new poster child for everything wrong with that approach. In the end, ""Trinity War"" becomes little more than a stepping stone towards Forever Evil. The result is that ""Justice League"" #23 is an almost wholly unfulfilling ""finale"" issue."" Overall, Newsarama's Richard Gray praised the storytelling, with the event ""cleverly weaving in threads set up two years ago in all related titles."" However, Gray was somewhat critical of the fact that ""the last panel of “Trinity War” leads directly into “Forever Evil”, effectively making this one big event that begets another. It's a crime that both major syndicates are repeatedly guilty of these last few years, one so commonplace that it is increasingly difficult to take umbrage with a singular instance anymore."" Comic Book Resources' Doug Zawisza felt ""there are no true conclusions of any sort"" after the whole event, ""just more shock-for-shock's sake moments and lots of new questions"" added at the end of ""Justice League"" #23. As with Gray, Zawisza ""was hopeful DC's tactic of bleeding events one to the next would be over following the relaunch, but this issue proves – without an inkling of doubt – that that is simply not the case."""
"Newsarama's Richard Gray gave ""Justice League"" #22 an 8 out of 10. Gray stated that ""Johns does a terrific job of pulling together what has been essentially four or five separate stories, incorporating not only the three main titles that this will span over the coming months, but introducing several new players into the mix as well."" He also praised that the story advanced and showed similar promise that the reboot to the New 52 did in 2011. Joshua Yehl of IGN gave the first chapter of the Trinity War a 7.8 out of 10. He felt the issue set the stage for the event and praised the character work. However, he thought that the conflict was not presented clearly yet and criticized the lack of the Justice League Dark in the first issue. Comic Book Resources' Doug Zawisza gave the issue 4 stars out of 5, saying ""Johns manages to balance personality expositions with story breaks, giving readers a sense of who the opposing sides are, if nothing else. Johns brings lots of big moments to the pages, but the emotions he wrings from those moments really help sell this book."" Zawisza was surprised by the amount of time that was spent on Madame Xanadu, feeling as though it was only there for reason to include the Justice League Dark, and was wary that the characters are in danger of being absorbed by the plot. All three praised the art in the issue, especially Ivan Reis' pencils."
"The conclusion to ""Trinity War"" received an 8 out of 10 from Richard Gray of Newsarama. He said, ""It was clear from the start of “Trinity War” that this would only ever be a bridge between one phase and the next. By the final page of ""Justice League"" #23, that bridge is not so much burned as left a bit smokey from the waves of revelations that come to light in the issue's final pages. It's a fitting conclusion, but one that will require additional reading when the dust has settled."" Doug Zawisza of Comic Book Resources was critical of the final issue, giving it 3.5 stars out of 5. He felt that while """"Justice League"" #23 is a loud, clanging final chapter to the crossover between Justice League books"", there ""was way too much is left hanging out to be completed elsewhere."" Jesse Schedeen of IGN was highly critical of ""Justice League"" #23, giving it a 6.0 out of 10. Schedeen felt that the Trinity of Sin ""are practically non-entities in the story"" at the end, after being teased as the center of the event back in 2012. He also felt the splash pages were overused and did not like lack of conclusion. Finally, he felt it was ""refreshing to see that Johns has been executing a long-term plan for the past two years"" and ""the highlight of this issue, and probably the crossover as a whole, is the reveal of the Justice League traitor."" Ivan Reis' art was a standout in the issue, and praised by all."
"Newsarama's Richard Gray gave the second part of ""Trinity War"", ""Justice League of America"" #6, a 7 out of 10. Gray felt this issue was ""the difficult middle chapter of the first half of this crossover"" and that ""the issue works successfully in building up the pieces of the broader puzzle, but it may leave readers attached to the core members of the team out in the cold."" He noted that the issue was more reflective in tone, opposed to pitched battles on every page. Gray criticized that the issue felt more like a ""Justice League"" issue, with the Justice League of America members all taking a back seat to the issue's events. He added that Doug Mahnke's pencils grounded the story in Geoff John's universe, but felt the battle sequences were not as good as Ivan Reis' in ""Justice League"" 22. Jesse Schedeen of IGN, who gave the issue an 8.1 out of 10, was wary that the ""heavy emphasis on The Outsider and his schemes made ""Trinity War"" feel less like the big event DC has been building towards since the start of the New 52 and more like another stepping stone on the road to Forever Evil,"" but was surprised at Johns' ability to not dwell on The Outsider that much in this issue, and give each member a moral ambiguity, questioning their role in the conflict. Schedeen, however, was disappointed at how little the Trinity of Sin appeared in the issue. He also felt that the ""Justice League of America"" series got its strongest contender for art in Mahnke, but noted that it was not his best effort. Comic Book Resources gave the issue 3.5 stars out of 5, with Doug Zawisza saying he was not impressed with the issue, with a lot going on, and nothing really moving forward. He felt that Mahnke's art excelled in certain characters, especially Hawkman, Martian Manhunter and Frankenstein."
"IGN's Joshua Yehl gave the fourth part of ""Trinity War"", ""Justice League of America"" #7, a 6.5 out of 10. Yehl said, ""With nearly two dozen heroes filling up every ounce of panel space, the reading experience becomes stretched thin as writers Geoff Johns and Jeff Lemire try to find something for everyone to say or do. The result is an event comic that has two more issues to go yet still hasn’t decided exactly what this story is really about."" He however, enjoyed Lex Luthor's appearance in the issue. Conversely, Richard Gray of Newsarama gave the issue an 8 out of 10, saying ""For all the false starts and misdirection of the New 52, the first major crossover in “Trinity War” has come together nicely. While there is still the pervading sense that this is merely a set-up for the next major event, the “Forever Evil” villains month, there's no denying that it has been a hell of a ride so far,"" adding ""all of the previously disparate elements from the various series begin to coalesce into something major."" Jim Johnson of Comic Book Resources gave the issue 4 stars out of 5, feeling it was ""loads of fanboy fun"" and the issue actually progressed the series storyline, not just the event's storyline."
"Newsarama's Richard Gray gave ""Justice League Dark"" #22 an 8 out of 10. Gray stated: ""While many events that run across multiple titles often slap a logo on an existing series and call it a tie-in...Lemire ensures that his team are an integral part, [making] the team finally feel as though they are part of a wider DC universe. Indeed, in many ways, this appears to be the primary goal of “Trinity War”, in that it unites the often disparate strands of the New 52."" Joshua Yehl of IGN gave the issue a 7.0 out of 10, saying ""While the art and characters are done well, the overall plot of Trinity War leaves much to be desired."" However, he praised Jeff Lemire's character work, and felt that Mikel Janin's art was the ""cleanest and most consistent looking chapter of ""Trinity War"" thus far."" Comic Book Resources' Kelly Thompson gave the issue 2.5 stars out of 5, saying the issue ""gets devoured by the massive ""Trinity War"" and buckles under the weight"" adding that the debate seems more plot driven than character driven. Despite the criticism of the story, Thompson praised Janin's art saying, ""he does nearly the impossible and draws just about every single major character in the DCU perfectly."""
