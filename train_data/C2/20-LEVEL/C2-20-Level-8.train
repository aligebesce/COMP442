But luckily there was only a c only one car stopped at the top.
So I just stopped dead and did a hill start.
Stopped at the top and did another hill start.
Plymouth Road's another awkward one.
"The first, the first down bit when you're going down Plymouth Road."
"Oh yeah, I bet."
"When you come to the right, the bend."
"Cos it's actually quite s , quite sharp bend."
And it gets wet down there as well.
It gets a bit slippy on there.
And there's manhole covers as you come out the bend.
And don't go  don't go speeding Brian.
You don't have the same control over a bike when you're speeding.

Running off it.
Didn't get run over.
"Run over, he actually went down though."
So  do you still want ?
"He's, he's dead!"
"You di you didn't really expect him er  the way they  did it, it wasn't like  well you didn't believe he was an angel did you?"
Really?
Until the end.
I didn't think he was anyway!
No I didn't.
Until the end.
That's what got me.
"Mind you  the title was a bit funny because it didn't  Almost an Angel  but  if he died and he went to heaven, then he must have been an angel but came back down, he's still an angel."
"Yeah, but an angel on probation, don't forget."
Oh the funniest part about it was when he  set these people's thing .
round and round without knowing.
Yeah.
With his sha electric shaver.
Oh!
Was it his electric shaver?
Yeah.
Mm.
But with no battery.

Trying to get away from a trolley and it's getting his back feet!
Ha ha ah ah!
No I wouldn't sell Bright.
I'd buy someone first.
Make sure someone was interested in  .
I'd buy Deane  and swap Bright in exchange for Deane.
No matter how bad he doesn't like it  he's well and truly gutted.
Er so him for Deane and
Yeah but Deane won't be available till the end of the season.
There's no way Sheffield United
Er I dunno.
just stoking the price up I think.
"Cos it's not old Bassett now, this is what it's all about."
to get the odd draw you need the odd goal and er it's not gonna come from any other people than er
"Oh yeah, Deane."
Deane.
But Deane didn't score today.
It was Beazley apparently.
Beazley.
Beazley.
Er I might see if I could pick up that  Sheffield United guy Jamie Hoyland.
He's quite good.
"As you say the main problem is, as you say is are you going to change your whole  team, game"
Yeah.
I don't know.
I think they'll do it slowly but  not this slowly.
I mean I th I think we should have bought someone along with er Gabbiadini to play with him.
could just bring him and expect  stuff.
Mm could you get
"I think he's gonna have to raid the bottom divisions again, you know."
What sort of bottom divisions?
he's probably got his eye on .
I mean that Coleman was a very good buy wasn't he?
Yeah?
I don't think she knows it very well.
She said she's seen the film but none of the other family have seen it.
You know.
"Where they, they're having a fight and  they've got all the different people in the news like Chinese people go  and there's fights and then they get, there's custard pies thrown at them."
Oh yeah.

"She said well  it was down to the last two she said, I had a choice between a red and green cushion  or a fitness test."

Dad it's the tenth of
It's very odd isn't it!
December.
What?
Tenth of December.
Oh right.
Oh!er look I mean it at all unless David gives me a little
May  other meeting.
That's a good reason for David to give me a lift isn't it?
He won't mind will he?
"You'll have all re you'd know where it is, won't you, by then?"
Well I know where it is I just don't know how to get there.
Normal squad for tomorrow .
Do you hear Gary Lineker's got  his son's got
Yeah.
but it it's not life
Only fourteen
life endangering though is it
only fourteen babies under twelve months old get that every year!
God you know you are lucky  wouldn't you?
"The irony of it is this is that he  has done a lot, he gave ten thousand"
Yeah.
"pounds, is it, not to the leukaemia was it or w was it?"
Think it was cancer  childhood cancer or something.
"Sh , what she said to me"
you could probably save me reading wouldn't it?
"Yeah the doing er, say four, in this area but I   There were three."
Some down in the Midlands.
I think that's the same isn't it ?
And we selected all intelligent looking ones.
Yeah but
Bar one!
showed him.
So they made a mistake filling it in?
"Anyway, she"
So we've still got the
Anyway he said so he couldn't do it!
Well I'd only just brought it in the kitchen actually.
"Oh, I thought I'd give you a chance to put on your"
I don't care!
your posh accent.
"Ray, had it ."
wasn't just for me  I'd like to know him.
"You can,."
Careful!
"Totally, all the complications"
"and of course, they've been absolutely abnormal."
You still going on?
"Okay, it's on."
"No, not really ."
Wherever a   description of youth.
Well  where have you been today?
What is it?
What have you been doing?
Oh is it going?
It's good!
Three times three.
I don't know the answer!
Well look  three  three  and three.
So how many have you got?
Ten.
No!
Plonker !
You've got nine.
I'm just going
Anyway
to check.
"So, there you are."
"It's two point four four nine, which really, is very close to two and a half."
Which isn't quite right.
"Oh that, well that's the square root of the other one so you're, you're going to smaller square roots every time."
That gets very difficult.
Right.
Right.
So clear all that and go back to what you wanted to do.
"Right, I'll show you."
Ten  square root  is
Three point one six two two seven seven six.
Right.
Eh eh.
Four hundred and fifty six square root is twenty one point three five four one five six.
Very clever.
Useless for you though.
You don't really need that information do you?
Well dad!
"So what, what, what sort of information do you need?"
Tt.
Counting information.
until you get to London
Ah London is it mm?
I mainly do round the midlands now.
Mm.
Which suits me fine.
Mm.
to run all over the bloody place and
It's a shame.
If I'd have known you were coming I wouldn't have booked going out.
Oh  get yourself off.
If I don't do something with me life I spend my life sitting here all day
Here you are
stop this dog of mine scratching all the while.
I shall brush it and you won't like it Ben.
I've just give you one good brush haven't I?
Come here.
Come on
Is that the only daughter you've got?
Yes.
Yes we had seen her.
Aye I thought we had.

I think he's just probably losing his winter coat.
Yeah.
that lovely ni nice warm day we had.
Ooh I spend a lifetime running around after my baby.
Yeah.
"And you measured it with a protractor,"
Mm.
"it was forty five degrees so you thought it was one, but the scale was two to one."
Yeah.
"The gradient is the tan of the angle, but you can only read that off the graph if you've got the same units."
Same scale on the X and Y. Erm what would be  let's say someone gave you this  find an approximation for the gradient  erm Y equals X squared  minus one.
X squared?
"Y equals X squared minus one, at around the point where X equals three."
Someone wanted to know the gradient.
"So, so"
Ooh.
you d you'd have to find Y.
Okay.
So Y is three squared minus one.
Yeah okay.
be Y would equal eight.
Yeah.
Erm  so
Good.
"Right, draw a sketch, cos we need to know what we're working with here."
So Y could perhaps equal  three.
the rest of the graph
the opposite point.
Right.
Good.
It's symmetrical down the Y axis.
And  the lowest point.
It'd be about one .
About one.
"What's the graph going to look like here, when X is very big?"
.
Hello.
Come on.
Sing
I'm not singing honestly.
Show that this guide
I can't sing I'd embarrass myself .
Yeah but nobody can sing
I deter anybody who'd every wanted to get on one of the  buses .
No you wouldn't they'll all come on and say where's that girl that sings Robin Hood.
I don't think they would.
Are you not going to do this?
I'm not I'm sorry I'm not singing.

buzzing in ears when I go to bed at night.
Mhm.
I'm not getting to sleep.
"It's taking me oh quite a while to get to sleep and, and I'm not hearing too good."
Right.
Let's have a look in and see if your brains are expanding or what's happening in here.
No wonder you're not hearing so good.
No wonder you're getting a buzzing in your ears there's a big lump of concrete in there.
Is there?
Let's have another look at this.
Oh my.
For goodness sake.
There's a wee man with a pick and shovel in
Oh aye.
It's solid.
Is it?
Absolutely solid.
I've been putting drops in it too
Aye.
quite regular.
Aye.
"I'll, I'll need to give you some special stuff to loosen that."
Aye.
Because that's
Because it's
I've noticed you always used a machine .
.
"Is that it, I don't want the veggies, grapes, pears, iceberg, toms, cress, I think that's the lot ."
Do you want a bag?.
"Well it wouldn't come amiss, though"
.
I'd hate to drop the tomatoes half way across the road.
I've already dropped .
You want to drop the tomatoes.
Oh it's fun .
.
Splat.
Part of the fun.
I always leave .
"Yeah, two eight one, that's about right."

"Look dear, don't give him ."
You take the bag I'll take the money .
"No, I'll take the money, you take ."
I've got this the right way round haven't I.
"Come all the way from Amberry you see just to get, just to get stuff from you."

I'll bet it is.
Oh as I say I've seen the film.
"I, I liked the film of Hannibal, with Oliver Reed."
Now that's quite good.
Yeah.
Was it
I've never seen the film.
"It's very good, the film is."
But I mean round there it's absolutely steeped in history.
I couldn't believe it.
Mm.

Get used to carrying it.
Mm?
Get used to carrying it.
It  it didn't bother me at all.
"I'm not kidding you, it did I didn't feel it."
"I could feel a slight pressure on me shoulders, but it didn't restrict my movements in any way."
When?

In it.
On Saturday.
Mm.
"Well, just be very careful."
And don't get over cocky.
And keep away from big lorries.

I mean a bit of fear  is a good thing.
"Erm, I'm still scared every time I pull away."
"You know,ji little jitterbugs."
Yeah.
And  I went up Iver Road as well.
On a bike?
"O o on the way back from Andrew's, yeah."
I always found that awkward at the top.
Yeah.
Specially if there was cars on the hill and I had to pull up behind them.
"Cos you you run out of you know, what things to do."
"Cos you've gotta have one foot on the ground  and you've gotta have one o ha foot, one on the brake"

to be a concert there.

No.
This is at the Rhodes Centre.
The Rhodes Centre.
The concert  at which we've got this stall.

"And he said, today he phoned me just as I was going out and I didn't really sort of stop and talk to him very long."
He just asked me what we needed and I said well a table.
We don't really need anything else do we?
Like power supply or
Oh no  quite
something with flashing lights on it!
So what time of the day is that?
It's evening.
seven or eight o'clock.
He told me.
How long does it go on for?
No idea.
He said he'd phone me again you see.
I think if there's a concert there'll be a rush at the beginning and there'll be a rush at the end.
"Possibly a rush at the, at an interval I suppose."
What concert is it then?
I mean
"And put the heater on there, put the fire on there."
Mm.
Well I dunno.

Mm.
There's a  you know they used to put  I suppose vanilla essence or some of these  no almond would it be?
Mm.
I don't know.
There used to be a lot more taste on it though than there is on that one anyway.

Belongs to the caravan
Yeah.
"Well that's what I mean, belongs to the caravan."
Why was it stuck on the bed?
Because that is the mattress for the bed that folds away in the sitting room.
Right?
But it seems to me to be a foam thing.
You don't think it's necessary?
"If they don't respond by the date, you know do it quickly"
Yeah.

He said he was going to   and see that it was done

"You smoke too much, do you want a cig?"
Go on then.

I'd rather there were sheep in the field than pigs.
Didn't like having pigs.
Geese were alright weren't they?
Except it wasn't very nice watching them disappear just before Christmas.

"Put my school shirt on, oh you won't see it!"
Oh no won't see it with that flipping big collar on my school shirt!
"Actually, you couldn't see it, but you could see it through anyway so it didn't make really that much difference."
"But like, I got the mirror down and like, I looked at it  and whether it was the light or whether it just hadn't come up cos it was only like, a few seconds afterwards"
Mm.
"I looked at it and it was just like sort of, light brown  and I thought oh that's not too bad!"

"Do you think it's sort of, you know, do you hold a lot of views in common with people you work beside or?"
"Not, no, not really."
Not really.
We've got quite a mixture.
"Oh, has it gone round a bit?"
"Yeah, it's gone round a bit now."
Yeah.

There's no toilet in them
And you probably have to hire them by the week do you?
Er minimum of four weeks.

And how do you move them around?
"Well they would move them round  this fella himself, but it's gonna be a hell of a lot of money to get them to do that."

A and the forms as it stands picks up most of the points that we've just raised.
Does it have a box for us to put our costs in?
Oh yeah.

"Anyway, I'm going to get ready or we'll never get the shopping done before you go to work."
Anyway

"Oh, that's a good idea  I hope we can get out at the ."
"Have you stuck a poster , you haven't, in the back window"

Yes

Hope I've got my glasses with me or I can't see the prices.
"Oh, I haven't got my purse."
Oh brilliant.
Is that a squashed ball in the road?
That means I haven't got a key to get back in the house .
If you just stop here I'll run over the road.
Give me the key please.
Thanks.
Oh
No cos it's dark and they won't fly.
"Yeah then yo yo you strip the light off, I've had all that."
"Yeah they won't fly when it's dark, they just stay where"
If you come out  and then you put the light off  yo yo they've got to  su the way you put them in the cage.
They can't fly at night.
"Yeah, don't worry about me Ann, I'm alright."
"You're not right, you're not like you should be."
Well I know
No a I can't see that that Friday is now Sunday night.
Oh yeah but it's not too bad  I'm alright  I really am  I feel a hell of a lot better.
"Maybe, you still got a headache, and you're still not right  you wouldn't of"
I'm alright.

Oh.
I think I'm a I'm a I am I feel a lot better.
I can't see that that could of been Friday's episode that's still effecting you today.
These must be the sixth formers in the dresses.
Yeah probably.
Their hairs th the hairstyles are really funny!
Yeah.
Look at these hairstyles!
Look at that one!
Yeah look at that one !maybe we've miscalculated.
That might be later might'n it?
Might be earlier !
There's a sixty one.
What staff have left and
They must be the ones in the white blouses then.
Yeah  mm mm.
"It's funny isn't it, you don't imagine people with hair like that!"
It's fifty four.
"She was a bit of a  tart, weren't she?"
Yellow flag coming out of his aerial.
Oh where would you prefer your ae aerial?
Would you like it there  up there or at the back?
Up there's alright.
"I like it the way the ones that you can  close each time, now I'm sure my aerial will last longer."
Cos you can
What do you mean close.
Well it compacts.
Oh yeah.
"The ones that stick out all the time, they  I suppose that is good."
"If you have one that doesn't compact, you you're best to have one in the middle cos it's less likely to get pranged there isn't it?"
Yeah.
Here like walkers by can bend it and  Oh look.
Here's my next one.
Six.
I've let six go now.
You must have let someone go before now.
"I didn't, no I haven't."
No.
Haven't had the opportunity to.
What is this lady dressed up like?
What has she got on  ?
What has she got on her hair?
Weird.
Bunch of wool .
She'll be thinking where's that wool?
Oh it's on my head.
Look at those tiny rugby posts.
"Yeah, I don't know why they do that, I was gonna ask that, why they chop those off, look like they've been vandalized don't they?"
Yeah.
It's only for junior rugby though.
They haven't replaced that garage have they?
Mm.
And she said that everything was mouldy  in er  you know the  even the curtains were mildew!
And how did she put salt round?
Because this is a hell of a lot damper today  than what it was when I had the salt about you.
you  but er  some people
Course not!
Yes.
Well I'd never heard of salt being put down before!
"But she  yes, she told me that in all, in the shop."
In the reception.
"She said, put it"
"Yeah, well"
down.
"yeah, these might tell you but  I always heard that salt was damp!"
Yeah but it attracts the
The
water in
the
"the air, into the salt!"
"and of course, once it's in the salt, it's steams!"
Well it's only now it feels like this!
It was not like this when we were down here washing it.
Well that's common sense when you think about it isn't it?
"You put, you put a drop of water on it  you put er  a bowl of salt  and  that will go down  eventually!"
Mm.
If the air is damp.
It's collected the water .
"Once that's damp, that's rising the steam!"
So how else do you keep it dry?
"She said, straight to me now!"
"I said that caravan is soaking wet, I said!"
The mattresses!
Yeah.
Bye.
See ya.
Bye.
See you later.
"Oh no, she's got to walk round with him."
"The thing is, you can't really, you couldn't sort of see this jagged mess."
He's made a right mess of it.
"He shaved up the back, hasn't he?"
It's odd and even.
"Yeah, but, yeah"
"And you get this, this bit here"
"he's all shaved, his hair come back over it."
"See like, long hair here, so it's hanging down, scraggily,so you've got like a shaved head, with all these bits here ain't ya?"
"So it covers it up a little bit, but it looks like he's gone bald."
No.
"Because he's like, long bits of hair, like this thick, hanging over, a shaved head,and you know, you know Tina, you know Tina Turner, you know her husband kept on going like this all the time  yeah  mine does that all the time  yeah, I go oh pack it in."
"Like Peter, you know, he does all this, like he keeps going, oh show it to me, I can't I'm trying to grow it."
"I'm trying it down, like, so it's round here."
"Do you think it'd be good like that, and I went, yes Ryan it'd look much better."
"Cos he keeps growing his hair, to sort of there, and then he has it cut off, don't he, he's shaved."
"Cos he has to have it undercut, cos that's hard."
"He's full of being hard, isn't he, Ryan?"
"He is, ain't he, just full of it."
"Oh  I've got something, erm, Peter's in prison,"
"Oh no, really?"
Three years.
You're joking.
No.
Really?
"I  when I went, you know when I went down, do you remember I told you that I got caught up with him?"
Yeah.
Well I think that's awful  I do.
"Well yeah   well I suppose that's what she thinks, if she gonna go through the rest of her life with a bloke she hates."
"Well she might as well get rid of him now, I suppose  while she's young enough to find perhaps find"
Yeah.
somebody else.
Well whatev whatever's all this big house in aid of then?
I bet they're gonna build it and sell it!
Well that's gonna be the farm though innit?
They'll have to sell   sell the farm and everything.
"Well yeah, I would've thought so because le"
And hope .
"Well let's face it erm  he's got a, a half  a half a right to it."
I know yeah.
"He's worked hard, he's worked  he ain't he does work, when he works."
Does he though?
Well I dunno.
"I always see him riding about up the  Steven   there  he's always up there  I know when I used to work for  it was always Steve who used to be  riding to this farm, riding to that farm, checking on this, checking on that and taking the wages round that sort of thing."
And he does it now does he?
Oh yeah.
You never see that  erm  do you?
No you don't.
Well yeah cos  when you think like that  if they do pack up he's got no  no nothing.
No not really.
Well not unless they  they don't sell that house  well look at poor old Dick!
Yeah but he's just about retiring age anyway isn't he.
Yeah but he's still gotta have a home to live in Geoff!
"Well yeah, alright  yeah but they normally get out don't they?"
When they were  like Jack  what's his name?
Erm  Jack  the foreman he got out and when he  when he retired cos  you know
Well that's like er
the house went with the job.
but then they've got er  er  said they  they asked if they could  rent his house off him until they got themselves sorted out.
And left  left
Well I only said whatever you want to do.
Do you wanna go up for suit .
"I said, that's all we want."
"Now, you know"
"We go out to win on the night, we're playing tomorrow"
Exactly!
and we go out to win.
Everybody goes on about .
"If we win without it, we come in the first five that's all well and good."
"We you go out, do you go out to win?"
Everybody
But
does that.
you don't argue about it.
"If we lose, we lose."
"You don't, I mean I'd like to win it every bloody week but, I'd be chuffed."
I'd be as happy as a dog with two dicks!
I mean they stopped us Friday didn't they?
They thought it would stop us didn't they?
You thought it would stop us as good as they did.
"What, seven two was it"
Six
or
"No, six."
two.
one of them.
Mm.
"I mean we played good, but just  couldn't get out and they did."
Well the door was open and nobody were worried about that.
Don't you remember that thirty doubles.
"What, they got it?"
"And if we if if we ring up, he puts he just puts the phone straight down, soon as you tell him who it is."
Probably goes back from when they went
"He said, I, she said I can live without him anyhow."
"It'll drop off, that."
It won't.
It will.
"Come on,yella."
"I found some Mighty Muscle in garage, you know."
How much.
You know that big round tin.
"I, not how much is in it, but it'll probably be about that much in bottom."
"I know  wanting  to do this room, really, 'cos it would be too cold."
Get away with one.
I wish we'd just  too cold.
"You won't, as far as  we're having to buy coal at that price."
"No, I know."
"Every time we have any spare money, it has to go on pigging coal."
how much.
You know that big round tin?
Yeah.
"I don't know how much is in it, but probably be about that much in bottom."
"might be  really, couldn't  too cold."
Get away with one.
"I wish we'd afford some  I mean, it's cold."
"You won't  while we're having the buy coal, at that price."
"No, I know."
"Every time we have any spare money, it has to go on pigging coal."
"We'll probably just buy some, and that lad'll ring up."
He probably will.
Especially if this mild weather stops.
"But it is mild today, ain't it."
Yeah.
"So she said, Val said I thought  good for you mate, you didn't get pushed out  he's gone  they're all gone  till the new year innit?"
Well I wouldn't of wanted to go with them myself.
"Well not after that little escapade, nor would I."
"I wouldn't of thought so  I would of sa I would of said well if I bloody ju good enough for living with I bleeding come on a  I don't think she'd want him on holiday with her anyway  and her sister said is she hadn't got enough money, she'd pay for it."
That's right  that's what Val told me.
She don't have time for him.
What?
She hasn't got a lot of time for him now.
Who hasn't  her sister?
Her sister.
No  she just says he's a bloody big head!
Well he is isn't he?
Well yeah.
Ah I mustn't I must admit I don't think I know any worse than him.
But I think he's quite harmless really Geoff  I don't think he
Oh yeah.
"means any harm, that's his way."
Well that's yeah but I I must admit I find it quite tiring.
Well he's always been pleasant to me  you gotta
I can honestly say  he's the sort of bloke I would sort of try not to get lumbered with at a party or somewhere like that   I mean I don't mind I didn't mind talking to her  but I find her
Well I find her  boring.
Yeah.
I find her very boring  although she's a very kind person.
"Yeah, no I could talk to her more than I could talk to him."
"I'm surprised  you know, she isn't stuck for them children mo any more if he'd been"
Oh yeah.
like this  that's it.
Let's face it she erm  I mean she was the one who bloody married him!
Well she hates him!
Yeah.
She literally hates him!
Yeah.
.
No that's him
You've been in it!
that's him  on the phone
So have I!
he was saying all the sort say at work you know that they   they don't know and they start on about er
You have been a  .
"you ruin your chances so  about three times a week the  comes in to arrange my poll tax and all this  and they get going you know well why should a bloke that  having a big house and he only pays the same rate as them  so I said, well it's like this as far I'm concerned I said  you know  no bloke  works perhaps twice as many hours as you do  he chooses"
haven't you?
Yeah  yeah.
"When I said, I think that's wrong!"
Yeah.
"The only time you don't pay a self-employed stamp  is if you  your business  earns,yo you can actually get away it, if you've lost money on your own business  on paper  or if you've  earned"
Well we have!
Why have you got it?
"Yeah tha that's what I'm saying, I ain't got to."
You haven't got to pay it?
No
What about that last lot?
"Ah that's , what they've said once you've paid it, you can't get it back, and if you don't pay it they can't insist you pay it."
Well you haven't paid it.
No I paid the last one though.
Well you can't stop paying it now.
So you haven't gotta pay that one more .
"No , I can't afford to."
Ooh good!
Good good good.
"That's it, why should you have to keep"
Yeah.
paying for them all year long?
Ah but perhaps Ken's the same as you then?
Cos I shouldn't think he's made any profit.
Don't see why not.
"Some of it's useful, I mean"
What and that thing?
What?
That can be chucked.
"Well, we need it, the amount of stuff at the moment, and get rid of it  when we  know what we're doing with that thing."
Well we're gonna need two removal vans.
"Well if we have two removal vans, we have two removal vans!"
We didn't fit in the last one.
We only just fitted.
"The company pays for it, I don't care!"
And that was squeezing it.
But if the company pays for it I don't give a damn!
Hadn't you better contact Pickfords.
"Well they'll do it, I'm sure one"
Cos er they might sort of book them up ahead or something.
They'll do it in time.
They're not moving much at the moment.
Aren't they?
Well obviously not.
"Oh yeah, true !"
The housing market is hardly buoyant is it?
"So, in other words, you can  push them down a bit."
Did you get the er  bit they saved on the  stamp duty  to buy the kitchen?
It's possible.
Does that mean yes?
Oh good!
Mum was so embarrassed!
"She didn't know how you got the chee , the nerve to do it!"
Disgraceful!
"If you don't ask, you don't get anything."
"Don't ask, you don't get!"
"Marilla says she caught him hanging over the well-box four times today , trying to reach down to the dark . ''"
"`` He 's a limb , '' declared Mr. Harrison ."
`` He came over here yesterday and pulled six feathers out of Ginger 's tail before I could get in from the barn .
The poor bird has been moping ever since .
Those children must be a sight of trouble to you folks . ''
"`` Everything that 's worth having is some trouble , '' said Anne , secretly resolving to forgive Davy 's next offence , whatever it might be , since he had avenged her on Ginger ."
"Mr. Roger Pye brought the hall paint home that night and Mr. Joshua Pye , a surly , taciturn man , began painting the next day ."
He was not disturbed in his task .
The hall was situated on what was called `` the lower road . ''
"In late autumn this road was always muddy and wet , and people going to Carmody traveled by the longer `` upper '' road ."
The hall was so closely surrounded by fir woods that it was invisible unless you were near it .
Mr. Joshua Pye painted away in the solitude and independence that were so dear to his unsociable heart .
Friday afternoon he finished his job and went home to Carmody .
"Soon after his departure Mrs. Rachel Lynde drove by , having braved the mud of the lower road out of curiosity to see what the hall looked like in its new coat of paint ."
When she rounded the spruce curve she saw .
The sight affected Mrs. Lynde oddly .
"She dropped the reins , held up her hands , and said `` Gracious Providence ! ''"
She stared as if she could not believe her eyes .
Then she laughed almost hysterically .
`` There must be some mistake ... there must .
I knew those Pyes would make a mess of things . ''
"Mrs. Lynde drove home , meeting several people on the road and stopping to tell them about the hall ."
The news flew like wildfire .
"Gilbert Blythe , poring over a text book at home , heard it from his father 's hired boy at sunset , and rushed breathlessly to Green Gables , joined on the way by Fred Wright ."
"They found Diana Barry , Jane Andrews , and Anne Shirley , despair personified , at the yard gate of Green Gables , under the big leafless willows ."
"`` It is n't true surely , Anne ? ''"
exclaimed Gilbert .
"`` It is true , '' answered Anne , looking like the muse of tragedy ."
`` Mrs. Lynde called on her way from Carmody to tell me .
"Oh , it is simply dreadful !"
What is the use of trying to improve anything ? ''
`` What is dreadful ? ''
There could n't be a better child and you 'd hardly know she was in the house . ''
"`` Dora is too good , '' said Anne ."
`` She 'd behave just as well if there was n't a soul to tell her what to do .
"She was born already brought up , so she does n't need us ; and I think , '' concluded Anne , hitting on a very vital truth , `` that we always love best the people who need us ."
Davy needs us badly . ''
"`` He certainly needs something , '' agreed Marilla ."
`` Rachel Lynde would say it was a good spanking . ''
"XI Facts and Fancies `` Teaching is really very interesting work , '' wrote Anne to a Queen 's Academy chum ."
`` Jane says she thinks it is monotonous but I do n't find it so .
"Something funny is almost sure to happen every day , and the children say such amusing things ."
"Jane says she punishes her pupils when they make funny speeches , which is probably why she finds teaching monotonous ."
This afternoon little Jimmy Andrews was trying to spell ` speckled ' and could n't manage it .
"` Well , ' he said finally , ' I ca n't spell it but I know what it means . ' ''"
` What ? '
I asked . ''
"` St. Clair Donnell 's face , miss . '"
"`` St. Clair is certainly very much freckled , although I try to prevent the others from commenting on it ... for I was freckled once and well do I remember it ."
But I do n't think St. Clair minds .
It was because Jimmy called him ` St. Clair ' that St. Clair pounded him on the way home from school .
"I heard of the pounding , but not officially , so I do n't think I 'll take any notice of it ."
`` Yesterday I was trying to teach Lottie Wright to do addition .
"I said , ` If you had three candies in one hand and two in the other , how many would you have altogether ? ' '"
"A mouthful , ' said Lottie ."
"And in the nature study class , when I asked them to give me a good reason why toads should n't be killed , Benjie Sloane gravely answered , ` Because it would rain the next day . '"
"`` It 's so hard not to laugh , Stella ."
"I have to save up all my amusement until I get home , and Marilla says it makes her nervous to hear wild shrieks of mirth proceeding from the east gable without any apparent cause ."
She says a man in Grafton went insane once and that was how it began .
`` Did you know that Thomas a Becket was canonized as a SNAKE ?
Rose Bell says he was ... also that William Tyndale WROTE the New Testament .
Claude White says a ` glacier ' is a man who puts in window frames !
"`` I think the most difficult thing in teaching , as well as the most interesting , is to get the children to tell you their real thoughts about things ."
One stormy day last week I gathered them around me at dinner hour and tried to get them to talk to me just as if I were one of themselves .
"Do you think you can like me a little , Mary ? ''"
"It may be that Mrs. Hayden was not very much surprised , because Harrington 's face had been like an open book the day they chased the pig out of the garden together ."
"As for what she said , perhaps Bobbles , who was surreptitiously gorging himself on Harrington 's strawberries , may tell you , but I certainly shall not ."
The little brown house among the apple trees is shut up now and the boundary fence belongs to ancient history .
Sarah King has gone also and Mrs. John Harrington reigns royally in her place .
"Bobbles and Ted have a small , blue-eyed , much-spoiled sister , and there is a pig on the estate who may die of old age , but will never meet his doom otherwise ."
It is Bobbles ' pig and one of the famous fourteen .
Mordecai still shambles around and worships Mrs. Harrington .
"The garden is the same as of yore , but the house is a different place and Harrington is a different man ."
"And Mordecai will tell you with a chuckle , `` It was them notorious pigs as did it all . ''"
Why Not Ask Miss Price ?
"Frances Allen came in from the post office and laid an open letter on the table beside her mother , who was making mincemeat ."
"Alma Allen looked up from the cake she was frosting to ask , `` What is the matter ?"
"You look as if your letter contained unwelcome news , Fan . ''"
`` So it does .
"It is from Aunt Clara , to say she can not come ."
She has received a telegram that her sister-in-law is very ill and she must go to her at once . ''
"Mrs. Allen looked regretful , and Alma cast her spoon away with a tragic air ."
`` That is too bad .
I feel as if our celebration were spoiled .
But I suppose it ca n't be helped . ''
"`` No , '' agreed Frances , sitting down and beginning to peel apples ."
"`` So there is no use in lamenting , or I would certainly sit down and cry , I feel so disappointed . ''"
`` Is Uncle Frank coming ? ''
"`` Yes , Aunt Clara says he will come down from Stellarton if Mrs. King does not get worse ."
So that will leave just one vacant place .
We must invite someone to fill it up .
Who shall it be ? ''
Both girls looked rather puzzled .
Mrs. Allen smiled a quiet little smile all to herself and went on chopping suet .
She had handed the Thanksgiving dinner over to Frances and Alma this year .
They were to attend to all the preparations and invite all the guests .
It is no better than a sieve .
We are nearly drowned every time it rains .
But I do n't know where the money to do it is going to come from . ''
"`` Shingles for the roof , three , '' said Dorinda , as if she were carefully jotting down something in a mental memorandum ."
"`` And fourth -- now , Mother Page , I will have my say this time -- fourthly , biggest capital of all , a Nice , New Dress and a Warm Fur Coat for Mother Page this winter ."
"Yes , yes , you must have them , dearest ."
It 's absolutely necessary .
We can wait a year or so for college courses and music lessons to grow ; we can set basins under the leaks and borrow some more if we have n't enough .
"But a new dress and coat for you we must , shall , and will have , however it is to be brought about . ''"
"`` I would n't mind if I never got another new stitch , if I could only manage the other things , '' said Mrs. Page stoutly ."
"`` If your Uncle Eugene would only help us a little , until Leicester got through !"
He really ought to .
But of course he never will . ''
`` Have you ever asked him ? ''
said Dorinda .
"`` Oh , my dear , no ; of course not , '' said Mrs. Page in a horrified tone , as if Dorinda had asked if she had ever stolen a neighbour 's spoons ."
"`` I do n't see why you should n't , '' said Dorinda seriously ."
"`` Oh , Dorinda , Uncle Eugene hates us all ."
He is terribly bitter against us .
"He would never , never listen to any request for help , even if I could bring myself to make it . ''"
"`` Mother , what was the trouble between us and Uncle Eugene ?"
I have never known the rights of it .
I was too small to understand when I was home before .
"All I remember is that Uncle Eugene never came to see us or spoke to us when he met us anywhere , and we were all afraid of him somehow ."
I used to think of him as an ogre who would come creeping up the back stairs after dark and carry me off bodily if I was n't good .
What made him our enemy ?
And how did he come to get all of Grandfather Page 's property when Father got nothing ? ''
"`` Well , you know , Dorinda , that your Grandfather Page was married twice ."
"Eugene was his first wife 's son , and your father the second wife 's ."
Eugene was a great deal older than your father -- he was twenty-five when your father was born .
"He was always an odd man , even in his youth , and he had been much displeased at his father 's second marriage ."
"But he was very fond of your father -- whose mother , as you know , died at his birth -- and they were good friends and comrades until just before your father went to college ."
"He said that he must really go back or he would be late for dinner , lifted his hat politely , and departed ."
"Katherine waited until he was out of sight , then sat down on the sand and put on her shoes and stockings ."
`` Who on earth can he be ? ''
she said to herself .
`` And where have I seen him before ?
There was certainly something familiar about his appearance .
"He is very nice , but he must have thought me crazy ."
I wonder if he belongs to Harbour Hill . ''
The mystery was solved when she got home and found a letter from Edith awaiting her .
"`` I see Ned quite often , '' wrote the latter , `` and I think he is perfectly splendid ."
"You are a lucky girl , Kate ."
"But oh , do you know that Sidney is actually at Harbour Hill , too , or at least quite near it ?"
I had a letter from him yesterday .
"He has gone down there to spend his vacation , because it is so quiet , and to finish up some horrid scientific book he is working at ."
He 's boarding at some little farmhouse up the shore .
I 've written to him today to hunt you up and consider himself introduced to you .
"I think you 'll like him , for he 's just your style . ''"
Katherine smiled when Sidney Keith 's card was brought up to her that evening and went down to meet him .
Her companion of the morning rose to meet her .
`` You ! ''
he said .
"`` Yes , me , '' said Miss Rangely cheerfully and ungrammatically ."
"`` You did n't expect it , did you ?"
I was sure I had seen you before -- only it was n't you but your photograph . ''
When Professor Keith went away it was with a cordial invitation to call again .
"He did not fail to avail himself of it -- in fact , he became a constant visitor at Sycamore Villa ."
Katherine wrote all about it to Edith and cultivated Professor Keith with a dear conscience .
They got on capitally together .
"They went on long expeditions up shore after seaweeds , and when seaweeds were exhausted they began to make a collection of the Harbour Hill flora ."
"This involved more long , companionable expeditions ."
"Katherine sometimes wondered when Professor Keith found time to work on his book , but as he made no reference to the subject , neither did she ."
"Once in a while , when she had time to think of them , she wondered how Ned and Edith were getting on ."
"But when she came out again Susan was sitting on the veranda , loosening her bonnet strings with the air of one who meant to stay where she was for some time ."
`` Have you got your baby to sleep ? ''
she asked kindly .
Your baby !
"Really , Susan might have more tact ."
"`` Yes , '' said Rilla shortly ."
"Susan laid her parcels on the reed table , as one determined to do her duty ."
She was very tired but she must help Rilla out .
"Here was Kenneth Ford who had come to call on the family and they were all unfortunately out , and `` the poor child '' had had to entertain him alone ."
But Susan had come to her rescue -- Susan would do her part no matter how tired she was .
"`` Dear me , how you have grown up , '' she said , looking at Ken 's six feet of khaki uniform without the least awe ."
"Susan had grown used to khaki now , and at sixty-four even a lieutenant 's uniform is just clothes and nothing else ."
`` It is an amazing thing how fast children do grow up .
"Rilla here , now , is almost fifteen . ''"
"`` I 'm going on seventeen , Susan , '' cried Rilla almost passionately ."
She was a whole month past sixteen .
It was intolerable of Susan .
"`` It seems just the other day that you were all babies , '' said Susan , ignoring Rilla 's protest ."
"`` You were really the prettiest baby I ever saw , Ken , though your mother had an awful time trying to cure you of sucking your thumb ."
Do you remember the day I spanked you ? ''
"`` No , '' said Ken ."
"`` Oh well , I suppose you would be too young -- you were only about four and you were here with your mother and you insisted on teasing Nan until she cried ."
"I had tried several ways of stopping you but none availed , and I saw that a spanking was the only thing that would serve ."
So I picked you up and laid you across my knee and lambasted you well .
You howled at the top of your voice but you left Nan alone after that . ''
Rilla was writhing .
Had n't Susan any realization that she was addressing an officer of the Canadian Army ?
Apparently she had not .
"Oh , what would Ken think ?"
"`` I suppose you do not remember the time your mother spanked you either , '' continued Susan , who seemed to be bent on reviving tender reminiscences that evening ."
"`` I shall never , no never , forget it ."
"She was up here one night with you when you were about three , and you and Walter were playing out in the kitchen yard with a kitten ."
"A whistle sounded thrice , and then again twice ."
It was repeated from another quarter .
"The woods on either side became full of the sound of people bursting through the underwood ; and a bewildered deer ran out into the open , stood for a second on three feet , with nose in air , and then plunged again into the thicket ."
"Selden still ran , bounding ; ever and again an arrow followed him , but still would miss ."
It began to appear as if he might escape .
"Dick had his bow armed , ready to support him ; even Matcham , forgetful of his interest , took sides at heart for the poor fugitive ; and both lads glowed and trembled in the ardour of their hearts ."
"He was within fifty yards of them , when an arrow struck him and he fell ."
"He was up again , indeed , upon the instant ; but now he ran staggering , and , like a blind man , turned aside from his direction ."
Dick leaped to his feet and waved to him .
`` Here ! ''
he cried .
`` This way !
here is help !
"Nay , run , fellow -- run ! ''"
"But just then a second arrow struck Selden in the shoulder , between the plates of his brigandine , and , piercing through his jack , brought him , like a stone , to earth ."
"`` O , the poor heart ! ''"
"cried Matcham , with clasped hands ."
"And Dick stood petrified upon the hill , a mark for archery ."
"Ten to one he had speedily been shot -- for the foresters were furious with themselves , and taken unawares by Dick 's appearance in the rear of their position -- but instantly , out of a quarter of the wood surprisingly near to the two lads , a stentorian voice arose , the voice of Ellis Duckworth ."
`` Hold ! ''
it roared .
`` Shoot not !
Take him alive !
It is young Shelton -- Harry 's son . ''
"And immediately after a shrill whistle sounded several times , and was again taken up and repeated farther off ."
"The whistle , it appeared , was John Amend-All 's battle trumpet , by which he published his directions ."
"`` Ah , foul fortune ! ''"
cried Dick .
`` We are undone .
"Swiftly , Jack , come swiftly ! ''"
And the pair turned and ran back through the open pine clump that covered the summit of the hill .
"CHAPTER VI -- TO THE DAY 'S END It was , indeed , high time for them to run ."
"Finally Mr. Barry shook his head , with a relieved air ."
`` She ca n't be down there .
"It 's a mighty curious thing where she could have got to , though ."
"Look here , young man , are you sure you 've no idea where your sister is ? ''"
"`` I 've told you a dozen times that I have n't , '' said Davy , with an injured air ."
`` Maybe a tramp come and stole her . ''
"`` Nonsense , '' said Marilla sharply , relieved from her horrible fear of the well ."
"`` Anne , do you suppose she could have strayed over to Mr. Harrison 's ?"
She has always been talking about his parrot ever since that time you took her over . ''
"`` I ca n't believe Dora would venture so far alone but I 'll go over and see , '' said Anne ."
Nobody was looking at Davy just then or it would have been seen that a very decided change came over his face .
"He quietly slipped off the gate and ran , as fast as his fat legs could carry him , to the barn ."
Anne hastened across the fields to the Harrison establishment in no very hopeful frame of mind .
"The house was locked , the window shades were down , and there was no sign of anything living about the place ."
She stood on the veranda and called Dora loudly .
"Ginger , in the kitchen behind her , shrieked and swore with sudden fierceness ; but between his outbursts Anne heard a plaintive cry from the little building in the yard which served Mr. Harrison as a toolhouse ."
"Anne flew to the door , unhasped it , and caught up a small mortal with a tearstained face who was sitting forlornly on an upturned nail keg ."
"`` Oh , Dora , Dora , what a fright you have given us !"
How came you to be here ? ''
"`` Davy and I came over to see Ginger , '' sobbed Dora , `` but we could n't see him after all , only Davy made him swear by kicking the door ."
And then Davy brought me here and run out and shut the door ; and I could n't get out .
"I cried and cried , I was frightened , and oh , I 'm so hungry and cold ; and I thought you 'd never come , Anne . ''"
`` Davy ? ''
But Anne could say no more .
She carried Dora home with a heavy heart .
Her joy at finding the child safe and sound was drowned out in the pain caused by Davy 's behavior .
The freak of shutting Dora up might easily have been pardoned .
But Davy had told falsehoods ... downright coldblooded falsehoods about it .
That was the ugly fact and Anne could not shut her eyes to it .
She could have sat down and cried with sheer disappointment .
She had grown to love Davy dearly ... how dearly she had not known until this minute ... and it hurt her unbearably to discover that he was guilty of deliberate falsehood .
Marilla listened to Anne 's tale in a silence that boded no good Davy-ward ; Mr. Barry laughed and advised that Davy be summarily dealt with .
"`` Now here , '' he cried , `` on my right hand , I swear to avenge it !"
"If that I fail , if that I spill not ten men 's souls for each , may this hand wither from my body !"
"I broke this Duckworth like a rush ; I beggared him to his door ; I burned the thatch above his head ; I drove him from this country ; and now , cometh he back to beard me ?"
"Nay , but , Duckworth , this time it shall go bitter hard ! ''"
"He was silent for some time , his face working ."
`` Eat ! ''
"he cried , suddenly ."
"`` And you here , '' he added to Matcham , `` swear me an oath to follow straight to the Moat House . ''"
"`` I will pledge mine honour , '' replied Matcham ."
`` What make I with your honour ? ''
cried the knight .
`` Swear me upon your mother 's welfare ! ''
"Matcham gave the required oath ; and Sir Daniel re-adjusted the hood over his face , and prepared his bell and staff ."
To see him once more in that appalling travesty somewhat revived the horror of his two companions .
But the knight was soon upon his feet .
"`` Eat with despatch , '' he said , `` and follow me yarely to mine house . ''"
"And with that he set forth again into the woods ; and presently after the bell began to sound , numbering his steps , and the two lads sat by their untasted meal , and heard it die slowly away up hill into the distance ."
`` And so ye go to Tunstall ? ''
Dick inquired .
"`` Yea , verily , '' said Matcham , `` when needs must !"
I am braver behind Sir Daniel 's back than to his face . ''
"They ate hastily , and set forth along the path through the airy upper levels of the forest , where great beeches stood apart among green lawns , and the birds and squirrels made merry on the boughs ."
"Two hours later , they began to descend upon the other side , and already , among the tree-tops , saw before them the red walls and roofs of Tunstall House ."
"`` Here , '' said Matcham , pausing , `` ye shall take your leave of your friend Jack , whom y ' are to see no more ."
"Come , Dick , forgive him what he did amiss , as he , for his part , cheerfully and lovingly forgiveth you . ''"
`` And wherefore so ? ''
asked Dick .
"`` An we both go to Tunstall , I shall see you yet again , I trow , and that right often . ''"
"`` Ye 'll never again see poor Jack Matcham , '' replied the other , `` that was so fearful and burthensome , and yet plucked you from the river ; ye 'll not see him more , Dick , by mine honour ! ''"
"He held his arms open , and the lads embraced and kissed ."
"`` And , Dick , '' continued Matcham , `` my spirit bodeth ill ."
"Y ' are now to see a new Sir Daniel ; for heretofore hath all prospered in his hands exceedingly , and fortune followed him ; but now , methinks , when his fate hath come upon him , and he runs the adventure of his life , he will prove but a foul lord to both of us ."
"He was a tall , broad-shouldered man of forty , and looking no younger , with dark grey eyes and a tanned , clean-cut face , clean-shaven save for a drooping moustache ."
"Jeffrey Miller was considered a handsome man , and Bayside people had periodical fits of wondering why he had never married ."
"They pitied him for the lonely life he must lead alone there at the Valley Farm , with only a deaf old housekeeper as a companion , for it did not occur to the Bayside people in general that a couple of shaggy dogs could be called companions , and they did not know that books make very excellent comrades for people who know how to treat them ."
"One of Jeffrey 's dogs was with him now -- the oldest one , with white breast and paws and a tawny coat ."
"He was so old that he was half-blind and rather deaf , but , with one exception , he was the dearest of living creatures to Jeffrey Miller , for Sara Stuart had given him the sprawly , chubby little pup years ago ."
They came down the hill together .
"A group of men were standing on the bridge in the hollow , discussing Colonel Stuart 's funeral of the day before ."
Jeffrey caught Sara 's name and paused on the outskirts of the group to listen .
"Sometimes he thought that if he were lying dead under six feet of turf and Sara Stuart 's name were pronounced above him , his heart would give a bound of life ."
"`` Yes , the old kunnel 's gone at last , '' Christopher Jackson was saying ."
"`` He took his time dyin ' , that 's sartain ."
"Must be a kind of relief for Sara -- she 's had to wait on him , hand and foot , for years ."
But no doubt she 'll feel pretty lonesome .
Wonder what she 'll do ? ''
`` Is there any particular reason for her to do anything ? ''
asked Alec Churchill .
"`` Well , she 'll have to leave Pinehurst ."
"The estate 's entailed and goes to her cousin , Charles Stuart . ''"
There were exclamations of surprise from the other men on hearing this .
"Jeffrey drew nearer , absently patting his dog 's head ."
He had not known it either .
"`` Oh , yes , '' said Christopher , enjoying all the importance of exclusive information ."
`` I thought everybody knew that .
Pinehurst goes to the oldest male heir .
The old kunnel felt it keen that he had n't a son .
"Of course , there 's plenty of money and Sara 'll get that ."
But I guess she 'll feel pretty bad at leaving her old home .
"Sara ai n't as young as she used to be , neither ."
Let me see -- she must be thirty-eight .
"Well , she 's left pretty lonesome . ''"
"`` Maybe she 'll stay on at Pinehurst , '' said Job Crowe ."
`` It 'd only be right for her cousin to give her a home there . ''
`` Why do n't you go ? ''
the old one asked politely .
"`` I suppose , '' said Peter huskily , `` I suppose I can still fly ? ''"
"You see , he had lost faith ."
"`` Poor little half-and-half , '' said Solomon , who was not really hard-hearted , `` you will never be able to fly again , not even on windy days ."
You must live here on the island always . ''
`` And never even go to the Kensington Gardens ? ''
Peter asked tragically .
`` How could you get across ? ''
said Solomon .
"He promised very kindly , however , to teach Peter as many of the bird ways as could be learned by one of such an awkward shape ."
`` Then I sha 'n' t be exactly a human ? ''
Peter asked .
`` No . ''
`` Nor exactly a bird ? ''
`` No . ''
`` What shall I be ? ''
"`` You will be a Betwixt-and-Between , '' Solomon said , and certainly he was a wise old fellow , for that is exactly how it turned out ."
The birds on the island never got used to him .
"His oddities tickled them every day , as if they were quite new , though it was really the birds that were new ."
"They came out of the eggs daily , and laughed at him at once , then off they soon flew to be humans , and other birds came out of other eggs , and so it went on forever ."
"The crafty mother-birds , when they tired of sitting on their eggs , used to get the young one to break their shells a day before the right time by whispering to them that now was their chance to see Peter washing or drinking or eating ."
"Thousands gathered round him daily to watch him do these things , just as you watch the peacocks , and they screamed with delight when he lifted the crusts they flung him with his hands instead of in the usual way with the mouth ."
All his food was brought to him from the Gardens at Solomon 's orders by the birds .
"He would not eat worms or insects -LRB- which they thought very silly of him -RRB- , so they brought him bread in their beaks ."
"Thus , when you cry out , `` Greedy !"
Greedy ! ''
"to the bird that flies away with the big crust , you know now that you ought not to do this , for he is very likely taking it to Peter Pan ."
Peter wore no night-gown now .
"You see , the birds were always begging him for bits of it to line their nests with , and , being very good-natured , he could not refuse , so by Solomon 's advice he had hidden what was left of it ."
"But , though he was now quite naked , you must not think that he was cold or unhappy ."
"He was usually very happy and gay , and the reason was that Solomon had kept his promise and taught him many of the bird ways ."
"If you 'd sassed her back , I 'd have thought she deserved it and would n't have blamed you a mite , but I would n't have bothered coming to talk to you either ."
"Well , well well !"
"Poor child , do n't cry ."
You just pick up and go home .
I 'll make it all right with Tom .
"You 're pretty near played out yourself , I can see that ."
"But a summer in Fir Cottage , with plenty of cream and eggs and my cookery , will soon make another girl of you ."
Do n't you dare to thank me .
It 's a privilege to be able to do something for Mary Carvell 's girls .
I just loved Mary . ''
"The upshot of the whole matter was that Marcella and Patty went , two days later , to Dalesboro , where Miss Draper gave them a hearty welcome to Fir Cottage -- a quaint , delightful little house circled by big Scotch firs and overgrown with vines ."
Never were such delightful weeks as those that followed .
Patty came rapidly back to health and strength .
"As for Marcella , Miss Draper 's prophecy was also fulfilled ; she soon looked and felt like another girl ."
"The dismal years of drudgery behind her were forgotten like a dream , and she lived wholly in the beautiful present , in the walks and drives , the flowers and grass slopes , and in the pleasant household duties which she shared with Miss Draper ."
"`` I love housework , '' she exclaimed one September day ."
`` I do n't like the thought of going back to the store a bit . ''
"`` Well , you 're not going back , '' calmly said Miss Draper , who had a habit of arranging other people 's business for them that might have been disconcerting had it not been for her keen insight and hearty good sense ."
`` You 're going to stay here with me -- you and Patty .
"I do n't propose to die of lonesomeness losing you , and I need somebody to help me about the house ."
I 've thought it all out .
"You are to call me Aunt Josephine , and Patty is to go to school ."
"I had this scheme in mind from the first , but I thought I 'd wait to see how we got along living in the same house , and how you liked it here , before I spoke out ."
"No , you need n't thank me this time either ."
I 'm doing this every bit as much for my sake as yours .
"Well , that 's all settled ."
"Patty wo n't object , bless her rosy cheeks ! ''"
`` Oh ! ''
"said Marcella , with eyes shining through her tears ."
"`` I 'm so happy , dear Miss Draper -- I mean Aunt Josephine ."
I 'll love to stay here -- and I will thank you . ''
`` Fudge ! ''
"Often crushed by so many passing feet it gave out its essence freely , and the spicy odour hung round them like a soundless , invisible benediction ."
"Ken looked up at Rilla , whose hair was shining in the moonlight and whose eyes were pools of allurement ."
All at once he felt sure there was nothing in that gossip about Fred Arnold .
"`` Rilla , '' he said in a sudden , intense whisper , `` you are the sweetest thing . ''"
Rilla flushed and looked at Susan .
"Ken looked , too , and saw that Susan 's back was turned ."
He put his arm about Rilla and kissed her .
It was the first time Rilla had ever been kissed .
She thought perhaps she ought to resent it but she did n't .
"Instead , she glanced timidly into Kenneth 's seeking eyes and her glance was a kiss ."
"`` Rilla-my-Rilla , '' said Ken , `` will you promise that you wo n't let anyone else kiss you until I come back ? ''"
"`` Yes , '' said Rilla , trembling and thrilling ."
Susan was turning round .
Ken loosened his hold and stepped to the walk .
"`` Good-bye , '' he said casually ."
Rilla heard herself saying it just as casually .
"She stood and watched him down the walk , out of the gate , and down the road ."
"When the fir wood hid him from her sight she suddenly said `` Oh , '' in a choked way and ran down to the gate , sweet blossomy things catching at her skirts as she ran ."
"Leaning over the gate she saw Kenneth walking briskly down the road , over the bars of tree shadows and moonlight , his tall , erect figure grey in the white radiance ."
As he reached the turn he stopped and looked back and saw her standing amid the tall white lilies by the gate .
He waved his hand -- she waved hers -- he was gone around the turn .
"Rilla stood there for a little while , gazing across the fields of mist and silver ."
She had heard her mother say that she loved turns in roads -- they were so provocative and alluring .
Rilla thought she hated them .
She had seen Jem and Jerry vanish from her around a bend in the road -- then Walter -- and now Ken .
"Brothers and playmate and sweetheart -- they were all gone , never , it might be , to return ."
Yet still the Piper piped and the dance of death went on .
When Rilla walked slowly back to the house Susan was still sitting by the veranda table and Susan was sniffing suspiciously .
"`` I have been thinking , Rilla dear , of the old days in the House of Dreams , when Kenneth 's mother and father were courting and Jem was a little baby and you were not born or thought of ."
It was a very romantic affair and she and your mother were such chums .
To think I should have lived to see her son going to the front .
As if she had not had enough trouble in her early life without this coming upon her !
And then what an unthinkable predicament I should have been in !
"`` When poor Fred became convinced that I could n't promise him , he behaved beautifully -- though that rather made things worse ."
"If he had been nasty about it I would n't have felt so heartbroken and remorseful -- though why I should feel remorseful I do n't know , for I never encouraged Fred to think I cared a bit about him ."
Yet feel remorseful I did -- and do .
"If Fred Arnold never comes back from overseas , this will haunt me all my life ."
"`` Then Fred said if he could n't take my love with him to the trenches at least he wanted to feel that he had my friendship , and would I kiss him just once in good-bye before he went -- perhaps for ever ?"
"`` I do n't know how I could ever had imagined that love affairs were delightful , interesting things ."
They are horrible .
"I could n't even give poor heartbroken Fred one little kiss , because of my promise to Ken ."
It seemed so brutal .
"I had to tell Fred that of course he would have my friendship , but that I could n't kiss him because I had promised somebody else I would n't ."
"`` He said , ` It is -- is it -- Ken Ford ? '"
`` I nodded .
It seemed dreadful to have to tell it -- it was such a sacred little secret just between me and Ken .
`` When Fred went away I came up here to my room and cried so long and so bitterly that mother came up and insisted on knowing what was the matter .
I told her .
"She listened to my tale with an expression that clearly said , ` Can it be possible that anyone has been wanting to marry this baby ? '"
"But she was so nice and understanding and sympathetic , oh , just so race-of-Josephy -- that I felt indescribably comforted ."
Mothers are the dearest things . ''
"` But oh , mother , ' I sobbed , ` he wanted me to kiss him good-bye -- and I could n't -- and that hurt me worse than all the rest . ' ''"
"` Well , why did n't you kiss him ? '"
asked mother coolly .
"` Considering the circumstances , I think you might have . ' ''"
"` But I could n't , mother -- I promised Ken when he went away that I would n't kiss anybody else until he came back . '"
`` This was another high explosive for poor mother .
"She exclaimed , with the queerest little catch in her voice , ` Rilla , are you engaged to Kenneth Ford ? ' ''"
"` I -- do n't -- know , ' I sobbed . ''"
` You -- do n't -- know ? '
repeated mother .
"`` Then I had to tell her the whole story , too ; and every time I tell it it seems sillier and sillier to imagine that Ken meant anything serious ."
I felt idiotic and ashamed by the time I got through .
`` Mother sat a little while in silence .
And it turned out that the dog was a lion and my Very Brave Aunt had druv him into the barn with a stick .
It was a wonder she was not et up but she was very brave .
Emerson Gillis says if she thought it was a dog she was n't any braver than if it really was a dog .
"But Emerson is jealous because he has n't got a Brave Aunt himself , nothing but uncles . ' '' '"
I have kept the best for the last .
You laugh at me because I think Paul is a genius but I am sure his letter will convince you that he is a very uncommon child .
Paul lives away down near the shore with his grandmother and he has no playmates ... no real playmates .
"You remember our School Management professor told us that we must not have ` favorites ' among our pupils , but I ca n't help loving Paul Irving the best of all mine ."
"I do n't think it does any harm , though , for everybody loves Paul , even Mrs. Lynde , who says she could never have believed she 'd get so fond of a Yankee ."
The other boys in school like him too .
There is nothing weak or girlish about him in spite of his dreams and fancies .
He is very manly and can hold his own in all games .
He fought St. Clair Donnell recently because St. Clair said the Union Jack was away ahead of the Stars and Stripes as a flag .
The result was a drawn battle and a mutual agreement to respect each other 's patriotism henceforth .
St. Clair says he can hit the HARDEST but Paul can hit the OFTENEST . ' ''
`` Paul 's Letter . ''
"` My dear teacher , '' ` You told us we might write you about some interesting people we knew ."
I think the most interesting people I know are my rock people and I mean to tell you about them .
I have never told anybody about them except grandma and father but I would like to have you know about them because you understand things .
There are a great many people who do not understand things so there is no use in telling them . ' ''
` My rock people live at the shore .
I used to visit them almost every evening before the winter came .
"Now I ca n't go till spring , but they will be there , for people like that never change ... that is the splendid thing about them ."
Nora was the first one of them I got acquainted with and so I think I love her the best .
"She lives in Andrews ' Cove and she has black hair and black eyes , and she knows all about the mermaids and the water kelpies ."
You ought to hear the stories she can tell .
Then there are the Twin Sailors .
"They do n't live anywhere , they sail all the time , but they often come ashore to talk to me ."
They are a pair of jolly tars and they have seen everything in the world ... and more than what is in the world .
Do you know what happened to the youngest Twin Sailor once ?
He was sailing and he sailed right into a moonglade .
"A moonglade is the track the full moon makes on the water when it is rising from the sea , you know , teacher ."
On his way home that evening he again met Isabel King .
She turned and walked back with him but she made no reference to Four Winds or its inhabitants .
"If Alan had troubled himself to look , he would have seen a malicious glow in her baleful brown eyes ."
But the only eyes which had any meaning for him just then were the grey ones of Lynde Oliver .
"* * * * * During Alan 's next three visits to Four Winds he saw nothing of Lynde , either in the house or out of it ."
This surprised and worried him .
"There was no apparent difference in Captain Anthony , who continued to be suave and friendly ."
"Alan always enjoyed his conversations with the Captain , who was witty , incisive , and pungent ; yet he disliked the man himself more at every visit ."
"If he had been compelled to define his impression , he would have said the Captain was a charming scoundrel ."
But it occurred to him that Emily was disturbed about something .
"Sometimes he caught her glance , full of perplexity and -- it almost seemed -- distrust ."
She looked as if she felt hostile towards him .
But Alan dismissed the idea as absurd .
She had been friendly from the first and he had done nothing to excite her disapproval .
Lynde 's mysterious absence was a far more perplexing problem .
"She had not gone away , for when Alan asked the Captain concerning her , he responded indifferently that she was out walking ."
Alan caught a glint of amusement in the older man 's eyes as he spoke .
He could have sworn it was malicious amusement .
One evening he went to Four Winds around the shore .
"As he turned the headland of the cove , he saw Lynde and her dogs not a hundred feet away ."
The moment she saw him she darted up the bank and disappeared among the firs .
Alan was thunderstruck .
There was no room for doubt that she meant to avoid him .
He walked up to the house in a tumult of mingled feelings which he did not even then understand .
He only realized that he felt bitterly hurt and grieved -- puzzled as well .
What did it all mean ?
He met Emily in the yard of Four Winds on her way to the spring and stopped her resolutely .
"`` Miss Oliver , '' he said bluntly , `` is Miss Lynde angry with me ?"
And why ? ''
Emily looked at him piercingly .
`` Have you no idea why ? ''
she asked shortly .
"I just hoped he would go on forgetting about Jims , Mrs. Crawford . ''"
"`` And then your pa would have the expense of raising him , '' said Cousin Sophia reprovingly ."
`` You young creeturs are terrible thoughtless . ''
"Jims himself ran in at this juncture , so rosy and curly and kissable , that he extorted a qualified compliment even from Cousin Sophia ."
"`` He 's a reel healthy-looking child now , though mebbee his colour is a mite too high -- sorter consumptive looking , as you might say ."
I never thought you 'd raise him when I saw him the day after you brung him home .
I reely did not think it was in you and I told Albert 's wife so when I got home .
"Albert 's wife says , says she , ` There 's more in Rilla Blythe than you 'd think for , Aunt Sophia . '"
Them was her very words .
` More in Rilla Blythe than you 'd think for . '
Albert 's wife always had a good opinion of you . ''
"Cousin Sophia sighed , as if to imply that Albert 's wife stood alone in this against the world ."
But Cousin Sophia really did not mean that .
She was quite fond of Rilla in her own melancholy way ; but young creeturs had to be kept down .
If they were not kept down society would be demoralized .
`` Do you remember your walk home from the light two years ago tonight ? ''
"whispered Gertrude Oliver to Rilla , teasingly ."
"`` I should think I do , '' smiled Rilla ; and then her smile grew dreamy and absent ; she was remembering something else -- that hour with Kenneth on the sandshore ."
Where would Ken be tonight ?
And Jem and Jerry and Walter and all the other boys who had danced and moonlighted on the old Four Winds Point that evening of mirth and laughter -- their last joyous unclouded evening .
"In the filthy trenches of the Somme front , with the roar of the guns and the groans of stricken men for the music of Ned Burr 's violin , and the flash of star shells for the silver sparkles on the old blue gulf ."
"Two of them were sleeping under the Flanders poppies -- Alec Burr from the Upper Glen , and Clark Manley of Lowbridge ."
Others were wounded in the hospitals .
But so far nothing had touched the manse and the Ingleside boys .
They seemed to bear charmed lives .
Yet the suspense never grew any easier to bear as the weeks and months of war went by .
"`` It is n't as if it were some sort of fever to which you might conclude they were immune when they had n't taken it for two years , '' sighed Rilla ."
`` The danger is just as great and just as real as it was the first day they went into the trenches .
"I know this , and it tortures me every day ."
And yet I ca n't help hoping that since they 've come this far unhurt they 'll come through .
"Oh , Miss Oliver , what would it be like not to wake up in the morning feeling afraid of the news the day would bring ?"
I ca n't picture such a state of things somehow .
"Want of practice , they called it ; but what it really meant was that they no longer believed ."
"Michael believed longer than the other boys , though they jeered at him ; so he was with Wendy when Peter came for her at the end of the first year ."
"She flew away with Peter in the frock she had woven from leaves and berries in the Neverland , and her one fear was that he might notice how short it had become ; but he never noticed , he had so much to say about himself ."
"She had looked forward to thrilling talks with him about old times , but new adventures had crowded the old ones from his mind ."
`` Who is Captain Hook ? ''
he asked with interest when she spoke of the arch enemy .
"`` Do n't you remember , '' she asked , amazed , `` how you killed him and saved all our lives ? ''"
"`` I forget them after I kill them , '' he replied carelessly ."
"When she expressed a doubtful hope that Tinker Bell would be glad to see her he said , `` Who is Tinker Bell ? ''"
"`` O Peter , '' she said , shocked ; but even when she explained he could not remember ."
"`` There are such a lot of them , '' he said ."
`` I expect she is no more . ''
"I expect he was right , for fairies do n't live long , but they are so little that a short time seems a good while to them ."
Wendy was pained too to find that the past year was but as yesterday to Peter ; it had seemed such a long year of waiting to her .
"But he was exactly as fascinating as ever , and they had a lovely spring cleaning in the little house on the tree tops ."
Next year he did not come for her .
She waited in a new frock because the old one simply would not meet ; but he never came .
"`` Perhaps he is ill , '' Michael said ."
`` You know he is never ill . ''
"Michael came close to her and whispered , with a shiver , `` Perhaps there is no such person , Wendy ! ''"
and then Wendy would have cried if Michael had not been crying .
Peter came next spring cleaning ; and the strange thing was that he never knew he had missed a year .
That was the last time the girl Wendy ever saw him .
For a little longer she tried for his sake not to have growing pains ; and she felt she was untrue to him when she got a prize for general knowledge .
"But the years came and went without bringing the careless boy ; and when they met again Wendy was a married woman , and Peter was no more to her than a little dust in the box in which she had kept her toys ."
Wendy was grown up .
You need not be sorry for her .
She was one of the kind that likes to grow up .
In the end she grew up of her own free will a day quicker than other girls .
All the boys were grown up and done for by this time ; so it is scarcely worth while saying anything more about them .
"You may see the twins and Nibs and Curly any day going to an office , each carrying a little bag and an umbrella ."
Michael is an engine-driver -LSB- train engineer -RSB- .
I asked them to tell me the things they most wanted .
"Some of the answers were commonplace enough ... dolls , ponies , and skates ."
Others were decidedly original .
Hester Boulter wanted ` to wear her Sunday dress every day and eat in the sitting room . '
Hannah Bell wanted ` to be good without having to take any trouble about it . '
"Marjory White , aged ten , wanted to be a WIDOW ."
"Questioned why , she gravely said that if you were n't married people called you an old maid , and if you were your husband bossed you ; but if you were a widow there 'd be no danger of either ."
The most remarkable wish was Sally Bell 's .
She wanted a ` honeymoon . '
I asked her if she knew what it was and she said she thought it was an extra nice kind of bicycle because her cousin in Montreal went on a honeymoon when he was married and he had always had the very latest in bicycles !
`` Another day I asked them all to tell me the naughtiest thing they had ever done .
"I could n't get the older ones to do so , but the third class answered quite freely ."
Eliza Bell had ` set fire to her aunt 's carded rolls . '
"Asked if she meant to do it she said , ` not altogether . '"
She just tried a little end to see how it would burn and the whole bundle blazed up in a jiffy .
Emerson Gillis had spent ten cents for candy when he should have put it in his missionary box .
Annetta Bell 's worst crime was ` eating some blueberries that grew in the graveyard . '
Willie White had ` slid down the sheephouse roof a lot of times with his Sunday trousers on . '
"` But I was punished for it 'cause I had to wear patched pants to Sunday School all summer , and when you 're punished for a thing you do n't have to repent of it , ' declared Willie ."
`` I wish you could see some of their compositions ... so much do I wish it that I 'll send you copies of some written recently .
"Last week I told the fourth class I wanted them to write me letters about anything they pleased , adding by way of suggestion that they might tell me of some place they had visited or some interesting thing or person they had seen ."
"They were to write the letters on real note paper , seal them in an envelope , and address them to me , all without any assistance from other people ."
Last Friday morning I found a pile of letters on my desk and that evening I realized afresh that teaching has its pleasures as well as its pains .
Those compositions would atone for much .
"Here is Ned Clay 's , address , spelling , and grammar as originally penned . ''"
` Miss teacher ShiRley Green gabels .
p.e. Island can birds '' ` Dear teacher I think I will write you a composition about birds .
birds is very useful animals .
my cat catches birds .
His name is William but pa calls him tom .
he is oll striped and he got one of his ears froz of last winter .
only for that he would be a good-looking cat .
"`` How lovely , '' cried Wendy so longingly that Mrs. Darling tightened her grip ."
"`` I thought all the fairies were dead , '' Mrs. Darling said ."
"`` There are always a lot of young ones , '' explained Wendy , who was now quite an authority , `` because you see when a new baby laughs for the first time a new fairy is born , and as there are always new babies there are always new fairies ."
"They live in nests on the tops of trees ; and the mauve ones are boys and the white ones are girls , and the blue ones are just little sillies who are not sure what they are . ''"
"`` I shall have such fun , '' said Peter , with eye on Wendy ."
"`` It will be rather lonely in the evening , '' she said , `` sitting by the fire . ''"
`` I shall have Tink . ''
"`` Tink ca n't go a twentieth part of the way round , '' she reminded him a little tartly ."
`` Sneaky tell-tale ! ''
Tink called out from somewhere round the corner .
"`` It does n't matter , '' Peter said ."
"`` O Peter , you know it matters . ''"
"`` Well , then , come with me to the little house . ''"
"`` May I , mummy ? ''"
`` Certainly not .
"I have got you home again , and I mean to keep you . ''"
`` But he does so need a mother . ''
"`` So do you , my love . ''"
"`` Oh , all right , '' Peter said , as if he had asked her from politeness merely ; but Mrs. Darling saw his mouth twitch , and she made this handsome offer : to let Wendy go to him for a week every year to do his spring cleaning ."
Wendy would have preferred a more permanent arrangement ; and it seemed to her that spring would be long in coming ; but this promise sent Peter away quite gay again .
"He had no sense of time , and was so full of adventures that all I have told you about him is only a halfpenny-worth of them ."
"I suppose it was because Wendy knew this that her last words to him were these rather plaintive ones : `` You wo n't forget me , Peter , will you , before spring cleaning time comes ? ''"
Of course Peter promised ; and then he flew away .
He took Mrs. Darling 's kiss with him .
"The kiss that had been for no one else , Peter took quite easily ."
Funny .
But she seemed satisfied .
"Of course all the boys went to school ; and most of them got into Class III , but Slightly was put first into Class IV and then into Class V. Class I is the top class ."
"Before they had attended school a week they saw what goats they had been not to remain on the island ; but it was too late now , and soon they settled down to being as ordinary as you or me or Jenkins minor -LSB- the younger Jenkins -RSB- ."
It is sad to have to say that the power to fly gradually left them .
"At first Nana tied their feet to the bed-posts so that they should not fly away in the night ; and one of their diversions by day was to pretend to fall off buses -LSB- the English double-deckers -RSB- ; but by and by they ceased to tug at their bonds in bed , and found that they hurt themselves when they let go of the bus ."
In time they could not even fly after their hats .
It was in this casual way that Wendy one morning made a disquieting revelation .
"Some leaves of a tree had been found on the nursery floor , which certainly were not there when the children went to bed , and Mrs. Darling was puzzling over them when Wendy said with a tolerant smile : ' I do believe it is that Peter again ! '"
"` Whatever do you mean , Wendy ? '"
"` It is so naughty of him not to wipe , ' Wendy said , sighing ."
She was a tidy child .
She explained in quite a matter-of-fact way that she thought Peter sometimes came to the nursery in the night and sat on the foot of her bed and played on his pipes to her .
"Unfortunately she never woke , so she did n't know how she knew , she just knew ."
"` What nonsense you talk , precious ."
No one can get into the house without knocking . ' '
"I think he comes in by the window , ' she said ."
"` My love , it is three floors up . '"
"` Were not the leaves at the foot of the window , mother ? '"
It was quite true ; the leaves had been found very near the window .
"Mrs. Darling did not know what to think , for it all seemed so natural to Wendy that you could not dismiss it by saying she had been dreaming ."
"` My child , ' the mother cried , ` why did you not tell me of this before ? ' '"
"I forgot , ' said Wendy lightly ."
She was in a hurry to get her breakfast .
"Oh , surely she must have been dreaming ."
"But , on the other hand , there were the leaves ."
"Mrs. Darling examined them carefully ; they were skeleton leaves , but she was sure they did not come from any tree that grew in England ."
"She crawled about the floor , peering at it with a candle for marks of a strange foot ."
She rattled the poker up the chimney and tapped the walls .
"She let down a tape from the window to the pavement , and it was a sheer drop of thirty feet , without so much as a spout to climb up by ."
Certainly Wendy had been dreaming .
"But Wendy had not been dreaming , as the very next night showed , the night on which the extraordinary adventures of these children may be said to have begun ."
On the night we speak of all the children were once more in bed .
"It happened to be Nana 's evening off , and Mrs. Darling had bathed them and sung to them till one by one they had let go her hand and slid away into the land of sleep ."
All were looking so safe and cosy that she smiled at her fears now and sat down tranquilly by the fire to sew .
"It was something for Michael , who on his birthday was getting into shirts ."
"The fire was warm , however , and the nursery dimly lit by three night-lights , and presently the sewing lay on Mrs. Darling 's lap ."
"Then her head nodded , oh , so gracefully ."
She was asleep .
"Well , the youngest Twin Sailor sailed along the moonglade till he came right up to the moon , and there was a little golden door in the moon and he opened it and sailed right through ."
He had some wonderful adventures in the moon but it would make this letter too long to tell them . ' ''
` Then there is the Golden Lady of the cave .
One day I found a big cave down on the shore and I went away in and after a while I found the Golden Lady .
She has golden hair right down to her feet and her dress is all glittering and glistening like gold that is alive .
And she has a golden harp and plays on it all day long ... you can hear the music any time along shore if you listen carefully but most people would think it was only the wind among the rocks .
I 've never told Nora about the Golden Lady .
I was afraid it might hurt her feelings .
It even hurt her feelings if I talked too long with the Twin Sailors . ' '' '
I always met the Twin Sailors at the Striped Rocks .
The youngest Twin Sailor is very good-tempered but the oldest Twin Sailor can look dreadfully fierce at times .
I have my suspicions about that oldest Twin .
I believe he 'd be a pirate if he dared .
There 's really something very mysterious about him .
He swore once and I told him if he ever did it again he need n't come ashore to talk to me because I 'd promised grandmother I 'd never associate with anybody that swore .
"He was pretty well scared , I can tell you , and he said if I would forgive him he would take me to the sunset ."
So the next evening when I was sitting on the Striped Rocks the oldest Twin came sailing over the sea in an enchanted boat and I got in her .
"The boat was all pearly and rainbowy , like the inside of the mussel shells , and her sail was like moonshine ."
"Well , we sailed right across to the sunset ."
"Think of that , teacher , I 've been in the sunset ."
And what do you suppose it is ?
The sunset is a land all flowers .
"We sailed into a great garden , and the clouds are beds of flowers ."
"We sailed into a great harbor , all the color of gold , and I stepped right out of the boat on a big meadow all covered with buttercups as big as roses ."
I stayed there for ever so long .
It seemed nearly a year but the Oldest Twin says it was only a few minutes .
"You see , in the sunset land the time is ever so much longer than it is here . ' ''"
` Your loving pupil Paul Irving . ' ''
"` P. S. of course , this letter is n't really true , teacher ."
"P.I. ' '' XII A Jonah Day It really began the night before with a restless , wakeful vigil of grumbling toothache ."
"When Anne arose in the dull , bitter winter morning she felt that life was flat , stale , and unprofitable ."
She went to school in no angelic mood .
That pie was a strong argument for Isaac .
I thought a man who had to live on such cookery did indeed need a wife and might be pardoned for taking desperate measures to get one .
I was dreadfully tired of broiling on the roof anyhow .
But it was the thunderstorm that decided me .
"When I saw it coming up , black and quick , from the northwest , I gave in at once ."
I had endured a good deal and was prepared to endure more ; but I had paid ten dollars for my hat and I was not going to have it ruined by a thunderstorm .
I called to Isaac and out he came .
"`` If you will let us down and promise to dispose of that dog before I come here I will marry you , Isaac , '' I said , `` but I 'll make you sorry for it afterwards , though . ''"
"`` I 'll take the risk of that , Anne , '' he said ; `` and , of course , I 'll sell the dog ."
I wo n't need him when I have you . ''
"Isaac meant to be complimentary , though you might n't have thought so if you had seen the face of that dog ."
"Isaac ordered Julius Caesar away and put up the ladder , and turned his back , real considerately , while we climbed down ."
We had to go in his house and stay till the shower was over .
I did n't forget the object of our call and I produced our subscription list at once .
`` How much have you got ? ''
asked Isaac .
"`` Seventy dollars and we want a hundred and fifty , '' I said ."
"`` You may put me down for the remaining eighty , then , '' said Isaac calmly ."
"The Applebys are never mean where money is concerned , I must say ."
"Isaac offered to drive us home when it cleared up , but I said `` No . ''"
I wanted to settle Melissa before she got a chance to talk .
"On the way home I said to her : `` I hope you wo n't mention this to anyone , Melissa ."
"I do n't mind marrying Isaac , but I do n't want people to know how it came about . ''"
"`` Oh , I wo n't say anything about it , '' said Melissa , laughing a little disagreeably ."
"`` Because , '' I said , to clinch the matter , looking significantly at her front hair as I said it , `` I have something to tell , too . ''"
Melissa will hold her tongue .
"By the Rule of Contrary `` Look here , Burton , '' said old John Ellis in an ominous tone of voice , `` I want to know if what that old busybody of a Mary Keane came here today gossiping about is true ."
"If it is -- well , I 've something to say about the matter !"
Have you been courting that niece of Susan Oliver 's all summer on the sly ? ''
"Burton Ellis 's handsome , boyish face flushed darkly crimson to the roots of his curly black hair ."
Something in the father 's tone roused anger and rebellion in the son .
"He straightened himself up from the turnip row he was hoeing , looked his father squarely in the face , and said quietly , `` Not on the sly , sir , I never do things that way ."
I do n't see the good of being so awful clean .
It 's lots more comfable being dirty . ''
"`` Paul Irving washes his face every day of his own accord , '' said Anne astutely ."
"Davy had been an inmate of Green Gables for little over forty-eight hours ; but he already worshipped Anne and hated Paul Irving , whom he had heard Anne praising enthusiastically the day after his arrival ."
"If Paul Irving washed his face every day , that settled it ."
"He , Davy Keith , would do it too , if it killed him ."
"The same consideration induced him to submit meekly to the other details of his toilet , and he was really a handsome little lad when all was done ."
Anne felt an almost maternal pride in him as she led him into the old Cuthbert pew .
"Davy behaved quite well at first , being occupied in casting covert glances at all the small boys within view and wondering which was Paul Irving ."
The first two hymns and the Scripture reading passed off uneventfully .
Mr. Allan was praying when the sensation came .
"Lauretta White was sitting in front of Davy , her head slightly bent and her fair hair hanging in two long braids , between which a tempting expanse of white neck showed , encased in a loose lace frill ."
"Lauretta was a fat , placid-looking child of eight , who had conducted herself irreproachably in church from the very first day her mother carried her there , an infant of six months ."
"Davy thrust his hand into his pocket and produced ... a caterpillar , a furry , squirming caterpillar ."
Marilla saw and clutched at him but she was too late .
Davy dropped the caterpillar down Lauretta 's neck .
Right into the middle of Mr. Allan 's prayer burst a series of piercing shrieks .
The minister stopped appalled and opened his eyes .
Every head in the congregation flew up .
"Lauretta White was dancing up and down in her pew , clutching frantically at the back of her dress ."
"`` Ow ... mommer ... mommer ... ow ... take it off ... ow ... get it out ... ow ... that bad boy put it down my neck ... ow ... mommer ... it 's going further down ... ow ... ow ... ow ... '' Mrs. White rose and with a set face carried the hysterical , writhing Lauretta out of church ."
Her shrieks died away in the distance and Mr. Allan proceeded with the service .
But everybody felt that it was a failure that day .
For the first time in her life Marilla took no notice of the text and Anne sat with scarlet cheeks of mortification .
When they got home Marilla put Davy to bed and made him stay there for the rest of the day .
She would not give him any dinner but allowed him a plain tea of bread and milk .
Anne carried it to him and sat sorrowfully by him while he ate it with an unrepentant relish .
But Anne 's mournful eyes troubled him .
"`` I s ` pose , '' he said reflectively , `` that Paul Irving would n't have dropped a caterpillar down a girl 's neck in church , would he ? ''"
"`` Indeed he would n't , '' said Anne sadly ."
"`` Well , I 'm kind of sorry I did it , then , '' conceded Davy ."
`` But it was such a jolly big caterpillar ... I picked him up on the church steps just as we went in .
He felt an instinctive reluctance to discuss Lynde Oliver with Isabel King .
"`` I saw her only for a moment , '' he said coldly , `` but she impressed me as being a beautiful woman . ''"
"`` They tell queer stories about her -- but maybe they 're not all true , '' said Isabel , unable to keep the sneer of malice out of her voice ."
At that moment Alan 's secret contempt for her crystallized into pronounced aversion .
He made no reply and they went the rest of the way in silence .
"At her gate Isabel said , `` You have n't been over to see us very lately , Mr. Douglas . ''"
"`` My congregation is a large one and I can not visit all my people as often as I might wish , '' Alan answered , all the more coldly for the personal note in her tone ."
"`` A minister 's time is not his own , you know . ''"
`` Shall you be going to see the Olivers ? ''
asked Isabel bluntly .
`` I have not considered that question .
"Good-night , Miss King . ''"
On his way back to the manse Alan did consider the question .
Should he make any attempt to establish friendly relations with the residents of Four Winds ?
"It surprised him to find how much he wanted to , but he finally concluded that he would not ."
They were not adherents of his church and he did not believe that even a minister had any right to force himself upon people who plainly wished to be let alone .
"When he got home , although it was late , he went to his study and began work on a new text -- for Elder Trewin 's seemed utterly out of the question ."
Even with the new one he did not get on very well .
At last in exasperation he leaned back in his chair .
Why ca n't I stop thinking of those Four Winds people ?
"Here , let me put these haunting thoughts into words and see if that will lay them ."
That girl had a beautiful face but a cold one .
Would I like to see it lighted up with the warmth of her soul set free ?
"Yes , frankly , I would ."
She looked upon me with indifference .
Would I like to see her welcome me as a friend ?
"I have a conviction that I would , although no doubt everybody in my congregation would look upon her as a most unsuitable friend for me ."
"Do I believe that she is wild , unwomanly , heathenish , as Mrs. Danby says ?"
"No , I do not , most emphatically ."
"I believe she is a lady in the truest sense of that much abused word , though she is doubtless unconventional ."
"Having said all this , I do not see what more there is to be said ."
And -- I -- am -- going -- to -- write -- this -- sermon .
Look to it : he that is last at the lych-gate Sir Daniel shall reward .
Look to it right well !
I know you for a man of naught .
"Nance , '' he added , to one of the women , `` is old Appleyard up town ? ''"
"`` I 'll warrant you , '' replied the woman ."
"`` In his field , for sure . ''"
"So the group dispersed , and while Clipsby walked leisurely over the bridge , Bennet and young Shelton rode up the road together , through the village and past the church ."
"`` Ye will see the old shrew , '' said Bennet ."
`` He will waste more time grumbling and prating of Harry the Fift than would serve a man to shoe a horse .
And all because he has been to the French wars ! ''
"The house to which they were bound was the last in the village , standing alone among lilacs ; and beyond it , on three sides , there was open meadow rising towards the borders of the wood ."
"Hatch dismounted , threw his rein over the fence , and walked down the field , Dick keeping close at his elbow , to where the old soldier was digging , knee-deep in his cabbages , and now and again , in a cracked voice , singing a snatch of song ."
"He was all dressed in leather , only his hood and tippet were of black frieze , and tied with scarlet ; his face was like a walnut-shell , both for colour and wrinkles ; but his old grey eye was still clear enough , and his sight unabated ."
"Perhaps he was deaf ; perhaps he thought it unworthy of an old archer of Agincourt to pay any heed to such disturbances ; but neither the surly notes of the alarm bell , nor the near approach of Bennet and the lad , appeared at all to move him ; and he continued obstinately digging , and piped up , very thin and shaky : `` Now , dear lady , if thy will be , I pray you that you will rue on me . ''"
"`` Nick Appleyard , '' said Hatch , `` Sir Oliver commends him to you , and bids that ye shall come within this hour to the Moat House , there to take command . ''"
The old fellow looked up .
"`` Save you , my masters ! ''"
"he said , grinning ."
`` And where goeth Master Hatch ? ''
"`` Master Hatch is off to Kettley , with every man that we can horse , '' returned Bennet ."
"`` There is a fight toward , it seems , and my lord stays a reinforcement . ''"
"`` Ay , verily , '' returned Appleyard ."
`` And what will ye leave me to garrison withal ? ''
"`` I leave you six good men , and Sir Oliver to boot , '' answered Hatch ."
"`` It 'll not hold the place , '' said Appleyard ; `` the number sufficeth not ."
It would take two score to make it good . ''
"`` Why , it 's for that we came to you , old shrew ! ''"
replied the other .
`` Who else is there but you that could do aught in such a house with such a garrison ? ''
`` Ay !
"when the pinch comes , ye remember the old shoe , '' returned Nick ."
`` There is not a man of you can back a horse or hold a bill ; and as for archery -- St. Michael !
"The Queen ordered him to kneel , and then said that for playing so beautifully she would give him the wish of his heart ."
"Then they all gathered round Peter to hear what was the wish of his heart , but for a long time he hesitated , not being certain what it was himself ."
"`` If I chose to go back to mother , '' he asked at last , `` could you give me that wish ? ''"
"Now this question vexed them , for were he to return to his mother they should lose his music , so the Queen tilted her nose contemptuously and said , `` Pooh , ask for a much bigger wish than that . ''"
`` Is that quite a little wish ? ''
he inquired .
"`` As little as this , '' the Queen answered , putting her hands near each other ."
`` What size is a big wish ? ''
he asked .
She measured it off on her skirt and it was a very handsome length .
"Then Peter reflected and said , `` Well , then , I think I shall have two little wishes instead of one big one . ''"
"Of course , the fairies had to agree , though his cleverness rather shocked them , and he said that his first wish was to go to his mother , but with the right to return to the Gardens if he found her disappointing ."
His second wish he would hold in reserve .
"They tried to dissuade him , and even put obstacles in the way ."
"`` I can give you the power to fly to her house , '' the Queen said , `` but I ca n't open the door for you . ''"
"`` The window I flew out at will be open , '' Peter said confidently ."
`` Mother always keeps it open in the hope that I may fly back .
`` How do you know ? ''
"they asked , quite surprised , and , really , Peter could not explain how he knew ."
"`` I just do know , '' he said ."
"So as he persisted in his wish , they had to grant it ."
"The way they gave him power to fly was this : They all tickled him on the shoulder , and soon he felt a funny itching in that part and then up he rose higher and higher and flew away out of the Gardens and over the house-tops ."
"It was so delicious that instead of flying straight to his old home he skimmed away over St. Paul 's to the Crystal Palace and back by the river and Regent 's Park , and by the time he reached his mother 's window he had quite made up his mind that his second wish should be to become a bird ."
"The window was wide open , just as he knew it would be , and in he fluttered , and there was his mother lying asleep ."
Peter alighted softly on the wooden rail at the foot of the bed and had a good look at her .
"She lay with her head on her hand , and the hollow in the pillow was like a nest lined with her brown wavy hair ."
"He remembered , though he had long forgotten it , that she always gave her hair a holiday at night ."
How sweet the frills of her night-gown were .
He was very glad she was such a pretty mother .
"But she looked sad , and he knew why she looked sad ."
"One of her arms moved as if it wanted to go round something , and he knew what it wanted to go round ."
"`` Oh , mother , '' said Peter to himself , `` if you just knew who is sitting on the rail at the foot of the bed . ''"
"As for the fourth , who brought up the tail , I had seen his like before , and knew him at once to be a sheriff 's officer ."
"I had no sooner seen these people coming than I made up my mind -LRB- for no reason that I can tell -RRB- to go through with my adventure ; and when the first came alongside of me , I rose up from the bracken and asked him the way to Aucharn ."
"He stopped and looked at me , as I thought , a little oddly ; and then , turning to the lawyer , `` Mungo , '' said he , `` there 's many a man would think this more of a warning than two pyats ."
"Here am I on my road to Duror on the job ye ken ; and here is a young lad starts up out of the bracken , and speers if I am on the way to Aucharn . ''"
"`` Glenure , '' said the other , `` this is an ill subject for jesting . ''"
"These two had now drawn close up and were gazing at me , while the two followers had halted about a stone-cast in the rear ."
`` And what seek ye in Aucharn ? ''
"said Colin Roy Campbell of Glenure , him they called the Red Fox ; for he it was that I had stopped ."
"`` The man that lives there , '' said I. `` James of the Glens , '' says Glenure , musingly ; and then to the lawyer : `` Is he gathering his people , think ye ? ''"
"`` Anyway , '' says the lawyer , `` we shall do better to bide where we are , and let the soldiers rally us . ''"
"`` If you are concerned for me , '' said I , `` I am neither of his people nor yours , but an honest subject of King George , owing no man and fearing no man . ''"
"`` Why , very well said , '' replies the Factor ."
"`` But if I may make so bold as ask , what does this honest man so far from his country ?"
and why does he come seeking the brother of Ardshiel ?
"I have power here , I must tell you ."
"I am King 's Factor upon several of these estates , and have twelve files of soldiers at my back . ''"
"`` I have heard a waif word in the country , '' said I , a little nettled , `` that you were a hard man to drive . ''"
"He still kept looking at me , as if in doubt ."
"`` Well , '' said he , at last , `` your tongue is bold ; but I am no unfriend to plainness ."
"If ye had asked me the way to the door of James Stewart on any other day but this , I would have set ye right and bidden ye God speed ."
"But to-day -- eh , Mungo ? ''"
And he turned again to look at the lawyer .
But just as he turned there came the shot of a firelock from higher up the hill ; and with the very sound of it Glenure fell upon the road .
"`` O , I am dead ! ''"
"he cried , several times over ."
"The lawyer had caught him up and held him in his arms , the servant standing over and clasping his hands ."
"And now the wounded man looked from one to another with scared eyes , and there was a change in his voice , that went to the heart ."
"`` Take care of yourselves , '' says he ."
`` I am dead . ''
"He tried to open his clothes as if to look for the wound , but his fingers slipped on the buttons ."
"With that he gave a great sigh , his head rolled on his shoulder , and he passed away ."
"The lawyer said never a word , but his face was as sharp as a pen and as white as the dead man 's ; the servant broke out into a great noise of crying and weeping , like a child ; and I , on my side , stood staring at them in a kind of horror ."
"I 'm glad ... I really feel the need of some diversion , for what with Anthony Pye in school and Davy Keith at home my nerves have had about all they can endure for one day . ''"
"IX A Question of Color `` That old nuisance of a Rachel Lynde was here again today , pestering me for a subscription towards buying a carpet for the vestry room , '' said Mr. Harrison wrathfully ."
`` I detest that woman more than anybody I know .
"She can put a whole sermon , text , comment , and application , into six words , and throw it at you like a brick . ''"
"Anne , who was perched on the edge of the veranda , enjoying the charm of a mild west wind blowing across a newly ploughed field on a gray November twilight and piping a quaint little melody among the twisted firs below the garden , turned her dreamy face over her shoulder ."
"`` The trouble is , you and Mrs. Lynde do n't understand one another , '' she explained ."
`` That is always what is wrong when people do n't like each other .
I did n't like Mrs. Lynde at first either ; but as soon as I came to understand her I learned to . ''
"`` Mrs. Lynde may be an acquired taste with some folks ; but I did n't keep on eating bananas because I was told I 'd learn to like them if I did , '' growled Mr. Harrison ."
"`` And as for understanding her , I understand that she is a confirmed busybody and I told her so . ''"
"`` Oh , that must have hurt her feelings very much , '' said Anne reproachfully ."
`` How could you say such a thing ?
I said some dreadful things to Mrs. Lynde long ago but it was when I had lost my temper .
I could n't say them DELIBERATELY . ''
`` It was the truth and I believe in telling the truth to everybody . ''
"`` But you do n't tell the whole truth , '' objected Anne ."
`` You only tell the disagreeable part of the truth .
"Now , you 've told me a dozen times that my hair was red , but you 've never once told me that I had a nice nose . ''"
"`` I daresay you know it without any telling , '' chuckled Mr. Harrison ."
`` I know I have red hair too ... although it 's MUCH darker than it used to be ... so there 's no need of telling me that either . ''
"`` Well , well , I 'll try and not mention it again since you 're so sensitive ."
"You must excuse me , Anne ."
I 've got a habit of being outspoken and folks must n't mind it . ''
`` But they ca n't help minding it .
And I do n't think it 's any help that it 's your habit .
"What would you think of a person who went about sticking pins and needles into people and saying , ` Excuse me , you must n't mind it ... it 's just a habit I 've got . '"
"You 'd think he was crazy , would n't you ?"
"And as for Mrs. Lynde being a busybody , perhaps she is ."
"But did you tell her she had a very kind heart and always helped the poor , and never said a word when Timothy Cotton stole a crock of butter out of her dairy and told his wife he 'd bought it from her ?"
Mrs. Cotton cast it up to her the next time they met that it tasted of turnips and Mrs. Lynde just said she was sorry it had turned out so poorly . ''
"`` I suppose she has some good qualities , '' conceded Mr. Harrison grudgingly ."
`` Most folks have .
At first my only feeling was one of annoyance .
Then a thought flashed into my mind that made me dizzy with fear .
The tide would be high that night .
If I could not escape from Island Rock I would inevitably be drowned .
I sat down limply on a ledge and tried to look matters fairly in the face .
I could not swim ; calls for help could not reach anybody ; my only hope lay in the chance of somebody passing down the shore or of some boat appearing .
I looked at my watch .
It was a quarter past three .
"The tide would begin to turn about five , but it would be at least ten before the rock would be covered ."
"I had , then , little more than six hours to live unless rescued ."
The flat was by this time out of sight around the point .
I hoped that the sight of an empty flat drifting down shore might attract someone 's attention and lead to investigation .
That seemed to be my only hope .
No alarm would be felt at Uncle Richard 's because of my non-appearance .
They would suppose I had gone to Uncle Adam 's .
"I have heard of time seeming long to a person in my predicament , but to me it seemed fairly to fly , for every moment decreased my chance of rescue ."
"I determined I would not give way to cowardly fear , so , with a murmured prayer for help , I set myself to the task of waiting for death as bravely as possible ."
"At intervals I shouted as loudly as I could and , when the sun came to the proper angle for the best view of the `` Hole in the Wall , '' I took the picture ."
"It afterwards turned out to be a great success , but I have never been able to look at it without a shudder ."
At five the tide began to come in .
"Very , very slowly the water rose around Island Rock ."
"Up , up , up it came , while I watched it with fascinated eyes , feeling like a rat in a trap ."
"The sun fell lower and lower ; at eight o'clock the moon rose large and bright ; at nine it was a lovely night , dear , calm , bright as day , and the water was swishing over the highest ledge of the rock ."
With some difficulty I climbed to the top and sat there to await the end .
"I had no longer any hope of rescue but , by a great effort , I preserved self-control ."
"If I had to die , I would at least face death staunchly ."
"But when I thought of my mother at home , it tasked all my energies to keep from breaking down utterly ."
Suddenly I heard a whistle .
Never was sound so sweet .
I stood up and peered eagerly shoreward .
"Coming around the `` Hole in the Wall '' headland , on top of the cliffs , I saw a boy and a dog ."
I sent a wild halloo ringing shoreward .
"Very gently he patted the little mound that her feet made , and he could see by her face that she liked it ."
"He knew he had but to say `` Mother '' ever so softly , and she would wake up ."
They always wake up at once if it is you that says their name .
Then she would give such a joyous cry and squeeze him tight .
"How nice that would be to him , but oh , how exquisitely delicious it would be to her ."
That I am afraid is how Peter regarded it .
In returning to his mother he never doubted that he was giving her the greatest treat a woman can have .
"Nothing can be more splendid , he thought , than to have a little boy of your own ."
"How proud of him they are ; and very right and proper , too ."
"But why does Peter sit so long on the rail , why does he not tell his mother that he has come back ?"
"I quite shrink from the truth , which is that he sat there in two minds ."
"Sometimes he looked longingly at his mother , and sometimes he looked longingly at the window ."
"Certainly it would be pleasant to be her boy again , but , on the other hand , what times those had been in the Gardens !"
Was he so sure that he would enjoy wearing clothes again ?
He popped off the bed and opened some drawers to have a look at his old garments .
"They were still there , but he could not remember how you put them on ."
"The socks , for instance , were they worn on the hands or on the feet ?"
"He was about to try one of them on his hand , when he had a great adventure ."
"Perhaps the drawer had creaked ; at any rate , his mother woke up , for he heard her say `` Peter , '' as if it was the most lovely word in the language ."
"He remained sitting on the floor and held his breath , wondering how she knew that he had come back ."
"If she said `` Peter '' again , he meant to cry `` Mother '' and run to her ."
"But she spoke no more , she made little moans only , and when next he peeped at her she was once more asleep , with tears on her face ."
"It made Peter very miserable , and what do you think was the first thing he did ?"
"Sitting on the rail at the foot of the bed , he played a beautiful lullaby to his mother on his pipe ."
"He had made it up himself out of the way she said `` Peter , '' and he never stopped playing until she looked happy ."
"He thought this so clever of him that he could scarcely resist wakening her to hear her say , `` Oh , Peter , how exquisitely you play . ''"
"However , as she now seemed comfortable , he again cast looks at the window ."
You must not think that he meditated flying away and never coming back .
"He had quite decided to be his mother 's boy , but hesitated about beginning to-night ."
It was the second wish which troubled him .
"He no longer meant to make it a wish to be a bird , but not to ask for a second wish seemed wasteful , and , of course , he could not ask for it without returning to the fairies ."
"Also , if he put off asking for his wish too long it might go bad ."
"Most disquieting reflection of all , was it not bad form to think about good form ?"
His vitals were tortured by this problem .
"It was a claw within him sharper than the iron one ; and as it tore him , the perspiration dripped down his tallow -LSB- waxy -RSB- countenance and streaked his doublet ."
"Ofttimes he drew his sleeve across his face , but there was no damming that trickle ."
"Ah , envy not Hook ."
There came to him a presentiment of his early dissolution -LSB- death -RSB- .
It was as if Peter 's terrible oath had boarded the ship .
"Hook felt a gloomy desire to make his dying speech , lest presently there should be no time for it ."
"`` Better for Hook , '' he cried , `` if he had had less ambition ! ''"
It was in his darkest hours only that he referred to himself in the third person .
`` No little children to love me ! ''
"Strange that he should think of this , which had never troubled him before ; perhaps the sewing machine brought it to his mind ."
"For long he muttered to himself , staring at Smee , who was hemming placidly , under the conviction that all children feared him ."
Feared him !
Feared Smee !
There was not a child on board the brig that night who did not already love him .
"He had said horrid things to them and hit them with the palm of his hand , because he could not hit with his fist , but they had only clung to him the more ."
Michael had tried on his spectacles .
To tell poor Smee that they thought him lovable !
"Hook itched to do it , but it seemed too brutal ."
"Instead , he revolved this mystery in his mind : why do they find Smee lovable ?"
He pursued the problem like the sleuth-hound that he was .
"If Smee was lovable , what was it that made him so ?"
A terrible answer suddenly presented itself -- `` Good form ? ''
"Had the bo ` sun good form without knowing it , which is the best form of all ?"
He remembered that you have to prove you do n't know you have it before you are eligible for Pop -LSB- an elite social club at Eton -RSB- .
With a cry of rage he raised his iron hand over Smee 's head ; but he did not tear .
"What arrested him was this reflection : `` To claw a man because he is good form , what would that be ? ''"
`` Bad form ! ''
"The unhappy Hook was as impotent -LSB- powerless -RSB- as he was damp , and he fell forward like a cut flower ."
"His dogs thinking him out of the way for a time , discipline instantly relaxed ; and they broke into a bacchanalian -LSB- drunken -RSB- dance , which brought him to his feet at once , all traces of human weakness gone , as if a bucket of water had passed over him ."
"`` Quiet , you scugs , '' he cried , `` or I 'll cast anchor in you ; '' and at once the din was hushed ."
"They liked this , and played hard till bedtime , when most of them turned in and slept like dormice ."
"Dan , however , had a plan in his head , and when he and Nat were alone , he unfolded it ."
`` Look here ! ''
"he said , taking from under his bed a bottle , a cigar , and a pack of cards , `` I 'm going to have some fun , and do as I used to with the fellows in town ."
"Here 's some beer , I got if of the old man at the station , and this cigar ; you can pay for 'em or Tommy will , he 's got heaps of money and I have n't a cent ."
"I 'm going to ask him in ; no , you go , they wo n't mind you . ''"
"`` The folks wo n't like it , '' began Nat ."
`` They wo n't know .
"Daddy Bhaer is away , and Mrs. Bhaer 's busy with Ted ; he 's got croup or something , and she ca n't leave him ."
"We sha n't sit up late or make any noise , so where 's the harm ? ''"
"`` Asia will know if we burn the lamp long , she always does . ''"
"`` No , she wo n't , I 've got a dark lantern on purpose ; it do n't give much light , and we can shut it quick if we hear anyone coming , '' said Dan ."
"This idea struck Nat as a fine one , and lent an air of romance to the thing ."
"He started off to tell Tommy , but put his head in again to say , `` You want Demi , too , do n't you ? ''"
"`` No , I do n't ; the Deacon will rollup eyes and preach if you tell him ."
"He will be asleep , so just tip the wink to Tom and cut back again . ''"
"Nat obeyed , and returned in a minute with Tommy half dressed , rather tousled about the head and very sleepy , but quite ready for fun as usual ."
"`` Now , keep quiet , and I 'll show you how to play a first-rate game called ` Poker , ' '' said Dan , as the three revellers gathered round the table , on which were set forth the bottle , the cigar , and the cards ."
"`` First we 'll all have a drink , then we 'll take a go at the ` weed , ' and then we 'll play ."
"That 's the way men do , and it 's jolly fun . ''"
"The beer circulated in a mug , and all three smacked their lips over it , though Nat and Tommy did not like the bitter stuff ."
"The cigar was worse still , but they dared not say so , and each puffed away till he was dizzy or choked , when he passed the `` weed '' on to his neighbor ."
"Dan liked it , for it seemed like old times when he now and then had a chance to imitate the low men who surrounded him ."
"He drank , and smoked , and swaggered as much like them as he could , and , getting into the spirit of the part he assumed , he soon began to swear under his breath for fear some one should hear him ."
`` You must n't ; it 's wicked to say ` Damn ! ' ''
"cried Tommy , who had followed his leader so far ."
"`` Oh , hang !"
"do n't you preach , but play away ; it 's part of the fun to swear . ''"
"`` I 'd rather say ` thunder turtles , ' '' said Tommy , who had composed this interesting exclamation and was very proud of it ."
"`` And I 'll say ` The Devil ; ' that sounds well , '' added Nat , much impressed by Dan 's manly ways ."
"Dan scoffed at their `` nonsense , '' and swore stoutly as he tried to teach them the new game ."
"But Tommy was very sleepy , and Nat 's head began to ache with the beer and the smoke , so neither of them was very quick to learn , and the game dragged ."
Take me in straight or I 'll break your arm . ''
"And he gave it , as he spoke , a wrench that made me cry out ."
"`` Sir , '' said I , `` it is for yourself I mean ."
The captain is not what he used to be .
He sits with a drawn cutlass .
"Another gentleman -- '' `` Come , now , march , '' interrupted he ; and I never heard a voice so cruel , and cold , and ugly as that blind man 's ."
"It cowed me more than the pain , and I began to obey him at once , walking straight in at the door and towards the parlour , where our sick old buccaneer was sitting , dazed with rum ."
"The blind man clung close to me , holding me in one iron fist and leaning almost more of his weight on me than I could carry ."
"`` Lead me straight up to him , and when I 'm in view , cry out , ` Here 's a friend for you , Bill . '"
"If you do n't , I 'll do this , '' and with that he gave me a twitch that I thought would have made me faint ."
"Between this and that , I was so utterly terrified of the blind beggar that I forgot my terror of the captain , and as I opened the parlour door , cried out the words he had ordered in a trembling voice ."
"The poor captain raised his eyes , and at one look the rum went out of him and left him staring sober ."
The expression of his face was not so much of terror as of mortal sickness .
"He made a movement to rise , but I do not believe he had enough force left in his body ."
"`` Now , Bill , sit where you are , '' said the beggar ."
"`` If I ca n't see , I can hear a finger stirring ."
Business is business .
Hold out your left hand .
"Boy , take his left hand by the wrist and bring it near to my right . ''"
"We both obeyed him to the letter , and I saw him pass something from the hollow of the hand that held his stick into the palm of the captain 's , which closed upon it instantly ."
"`` And now that 's done , '' said the blind man ; and at the words he suddenly left hold of me , and with incredible accuracy and nimbleness , skipped out of the parlour and into the road , where , as I still stood motionless , I could hear his stick go tap-tap-tapping into the distance ."
"It was some time before either I or the captain seemed to gather our senses , but at length , and about at the same moment , I released his wrist , which I was still holding , and he drew in his hand and looked sharply into the palm ."
`` Ten o'clock ! ''
he cried .
`` Six hours .
"We 'll do them yet , '' and he sprang to his feet ."
"Even as he did so , he reeled , put his hand to his throat , stood swaying for a moment , and then , with a peculiar sound , fell from his whole height face foremost to the floor ."
"I ran to him at once , calling to my mother ."
But haste was all in vain .
The captain had been struck dead by thundering apoplexy .
"It is a curious thing to understand , for I had certainly never liked the man , though of late I had begun to pity him , but as soon as I saw that he was dead , I burst into a flood of tears ."
"It was the second death I had known , and the sorrow of the first was still fresh in my heart ."
"`` There is no Black Dog here , '' said the doctor , `` except what you have on your own back ."
"You have been drinking rum ; you have had a stroke , precisely as I told you ; and I have just , very much against my own will , dragged you headforemost out of the grave ."
"Now , Mr. Bones -- '' `` That 's not my name , '' he interrupted ."
"`` Much I care , '' returned the doctor ."
"`` It 's the name of a buccaneer of my acquaintance ; and I call you by it for the sake of shortness , and what I have to say to you is this ; one glass of rum wo n't kill you , but if you take one you 'll take another and another , and I stake my wig if you do n't break off short , you 'll die -- do you understand that ?"
"-- die , and go to your own place , like the man in the Bible ."
"Come , now , make an effort ."
I 'll help you to your bed for once . ''
"Between us , with much trouble , we managed to hoist him upstairs , and laid him on his bed , where his head fell back on the pillow as if he were almost fainting ."
"`` Now , mind you , '' said the doctor , `` I clear my conscience -- the name of rum for you is death . ''"
"And with that he went off to see my father , taking me with him by the arm ."
"`` This is nothing , '' he said as soon as he had closed the door ."
`` I have drawn blood enough to keep him quiet awhile ; he should lie for a week where he is -- that is the best thing for him and you ; but another stroke would settle him . ''
3 The Black Spot ABOUT noon I stopped at the captain 's door with some cooling drinks and medicines .
"He was lying very much as we had left him , only a little higher , and he seemed both weak and excited ."
"`` Jim , '' he said , `` you 're the only one here that 's worth anything , and you know I 've been always good to you ."
Never a month but I 've given you a silver fourpenny for yourself .
"And now you see , mate , I 'm pretty low , and deserted by all ; and Jim , you 'll bring me one noggin of rum , now , wo n't you , matey ? ''"
`` The doctor -- '' I began .
"But he broke in cursing the doctor , in a feeble voice but heartily ."
"`` Doctors is all swabs , '' he said ; `` and that doctor there , why , what do he know about seafaring men ?"
"I been in places hot as pitch , and mates dropping round with Yellow Jack , and the blessed land a-heaving like the sea with earthquakes -- what to the doctor know of lands like that ?"
"-- and I lived on rum , I tell you ."
"It 's been meat and drink , and man and wife , to me ; and if I 'm not to have my rum now I 'm a poor old hulk on a lee shore , my blood 'll be on you , Jim , and that doctor swab '' ; and he ran on again for a while with curses ."
"`` Look , Jim , how my fingers fidges , '' he continued in the pleading tone ."
"`` I ca n't keep 'em still , not I. I have n't had a drop this blessed day ."
"That doctor 's a fool , I tell you ."
"If I do n't have a drain o ' rum , Jim , I 'll have the horrors ; I seen some on 'em already ."
"I seen old Flint in the corner there , behind you ; as plain as print , I seen him ; and if I get the horrors , I 'm a man that has lived rough , and I 'll raise Cain ."
Your doctor hisself said one glass would n't hurt me .
"I 'll give you a golden guinea for a noggin , Jim . ''"
"He was growing more and more excited , and this alarmed me for my father , who was very low that day and needed quiet ; besides , I was reassured by the doctor 's words , now quoted to me , and rather offended by the offer of a bribe ."
"A splashing noise near by drew him down to a valley through which ran a large river , and up a waterfall some salmon were leaping ."
"How their silver sides glistened in the light , and how he longed to catch some of the great fellows !"
But how could he do it ?
"He had beheld no one except the old women , and it was not very likely that they would be able to help him ."
"So with a sigh he turned away and went back to them , but , as he walked , a thought struck him ."
"He pulled out one of his hairs which hung nearly to his waist , and it instantly became a strong line , nearly a mile in length ."
"` Weave me a net that I may catch some salmon , ' said he ."
"And they wove him the net he asked for , and for many weeks he watched by the river , only going back to the old women when he wanted a fish cooked ."
"At last , one day , when he was eating his dinner , the old woman who always spoke first , said to him : ` We have been very glad to see you , grandson , but now it is time that you went home . '"
"And pushing aside a rock , he saw a deep hole , so deep that he could not see to the bottom ."
"Then they dragged a basket out of the house , and tied a rope to it ."
"` Get in , and wrap this blanket round your head , ' said they ; ` and , whatever happens , do n't uncover it till you get to the bottom . '"
"Then they bade him farewell , and he curled himself up in the basket ."
"Down , down , down he went ; would he ever stop going ?"
"But when the basket did stop , the young man forgot what he had been told , and put his head out to see what was the matter ."
"In an instant the basket moved , but , to his horror , instead of going down , he felt himself being drawn upwards , and shortly after he beheld the faces of the old women ."
"` You will never see your wife and son if you will not do as you are bid , ' said they ."
"` Now get in , and do not stir till you hear a crow calling . '"
"This time the young man was wiser , and though the basket often stopped , and strange creatures seemed to rest on him and to pluck at his blanket , he held it tight till he heard the crow calling ."
"Then he flung off the blanket and sprang out , while the basket vanished in the sky ."
"He walked on quickly down the track that led to the hut , when , before him , he saw his wife with his little son on her back ."
` Oh !
"there is father at last , ' cried the boy ; but the mother bade him cease from idle talking ."
"` But , mother , it is true ; father is coming ! '"
repeated the child .
"And , to satisfy him , the woman turned round and perceived her husband ."
"Oh , how glad they all were to be together again !"
"And when the wind whistled through the forest , and the snow stood in great banks round the door , the father used to take the little boy on his knee and tell him how he caught salmon in the Land of the Sun ."
How the Stalos Were Tricked -LSB- From the Journal of the Anthropological Institute . -RSB-
"` Mother , I have seen such a wonderful man , ' said a little boy one day , as he entered a hut in Lapland , bearing in his arms the bundle of sticks he had been sent out to gather ."
"` Have you , my son ; and what was he like ? '"
"asked the mother , as she took off the child 's sheepskin coat and shook it on the doorstep ."
"Only you must unfasten the halter you lead it with and bring it back , and do n't return by the high road , but through the forest . '"
"The next day , when the couple rose , they saw an enormous head looking in at their bedroom window , and behind it was a cow which was nearly as big as their hut ."
Kirsten was wild with joy to think of the money the cow would bring them .
` But how are you going to put the rope over her head ? '
asked she .
"` Wait and you 'll see , mother , ' answered her husband ."
"Then Peder took the ladder that led up to the hayloft and set it against the cow 's neck , and he climbed up and slipped the rope over her head ."
"When he had made sure that the noose was fast they started for the palace , and met the king himself walking in his grounds . '"
"I heard that the princess was going to be married , ' said Peder , ` so I 've brought your majesty a cow which is bigger than any cow that was ever seen ."
Will your majesty deign to buy it ? '
"The king had , in truth , never seen so large a beast , and he willingly paid the thousand dollars , which was the price demanded ; but Peder remembered to take off the halter before he left ."
After he was gone the king sent for the butcher and told him to kill the animal for the wedding feast .
"The butcher got ready his pole-axe ; but just as he was going to strike , the cow changed itself into a dove and flew away , and the butcher stood staring after it as if he were turned to stone ."
"However , as the dove could not be found , he was obliged to tell the king what had happened , and the king in his turn despatched messengers to capture the old man and bring him back ."
"But Peder was safe in the woods , and could not be found ."
"When at last he felt the danger was over , and he might go home , Kirsten nearly fainted with joy at the sight of all the money he brought with him ."
"` Now that we are rich people we must build a bigger house , ' cried she ; and was vexed to find that Peder only shook his head and said : ` No ; if they did that people would talk , and say they had got their wealth by ill-doing . '"
A few mornings later Hans came again .
"` Be off before you get us into trouble , ' said his father ."
"` So far the money has come right enough , but I do n't trust it . '"
"` Do n't worry over that , father , ' said Hans ."
` To-morrow you will find a horse outside by the gate .
Ride it to market and you will get a thousand dollars for it .
Only do n't forget to loosen the bridle when you sell it . '
"Well , in the morning there was the horse ; Kirsten had never seen so find an animal ."
"` Take care it does n't hurt you , Peder , ' said she ."
"` Nonsense , wife , ' answered he crossly ."
"` When I was a lad I lived with horses , and could ride anything for twenty miles round . '"
"But that was not quite the truth , for he had never mounted a horse in his life ."
"Still , the animal was quiet enough , so Peder got safely to market on its back ."
"There he met a man who offered nine hundred and ninety-nine dollars for it , but Peder would take nothing less than a thousand ."
"At last there came an old , grey-bearded man who looked at the horse and agreed to buy it ; but the moment he touched it the horse began to kick and plunge . '"
Next moment I was face to face with Anderson .
"He roared aloud , and his hanger went up above his head , flashing in the sunlight ."
"I had not time to be afraid , but as the blow still hung impending , leaped in a trice upon one side , and missing my foot in the soft sand , rolled headlong down the slope ."
"When I had first sallied from the door , the other mutineers had been already swarming up the palisade to make an end of us ."
"One man , in a red night-cap , with his cutlass in his mouth , had even got upon the top and thrown a leg across ."
"Well , so short had been the interval that when I found my feet again all was in the same posture , the fellow with the red night-cap still half-way over , another still just showing his head above the top of the stockade ."
"And yet , in this breath of time , the fight was over and the victory was ours ."
"Gray , following close behind me , had cut down the big boatswain ere he had time to recover from his last blow ."
"Another had been shot at a loophole in the very act of firing into the house and now lay in agony , the pistol still smoking in his hand ."
"A third , as I had seen , the doctor had disposed of at a blow ."
"Of the four who had scaled the palisade , one only remained unaccounted for , and he , having left his cutlass on the field , was now clambering out again with the fear of death upon him ."
`` Fire -- fire from the house ! ''
cried the doctor .
"`` And you , lads , back into cover . ''"
"But his words were unheeded , no shot was fired , and the last boarder made good his escape and disappeared with the rest into the wood ."
"In three seconds nothing remained of the attacking party but the five who had fallen , four on the inside and one on the outside of the palisade ."
The doctor and Gray and I ran full speed for shelter .
"The survivors would soon be back where they had left their muskets , and at any moment the fire might recommence ."
"The house was by this time somewhat cleared of smoke , and we saw at a glance the price we had paid for victory ."
"Hunter lay beside his loophole , stunned ; Joyce by his , shot through the head , never to move again ; while right in the centre , the squire was supporting the captain , one as pale as the other ."
"`` The captain 's wounded , '' said Mr. Trelawney ."
`` Have they run ? ''
asked Mr. Smollett .
"`` All that could , you may be bound , '' returned the doctor ; `` but there 's five of them will never run again . ''"
`` Five ! ''
cried the captain .
"`` Come , that 's better ."
Five against three leaves us four to nine .
That 's better odds than we had at starting .
"We were seven to nineteen then , or thought we were , and that 's as bad to bear . ''"
"* * The mutineers were soon only eight in number , for the man shot by Mr. Trelawney on board the schooner died that same evening of his wound ."
"But this was , of course , not known till after by the faithful party ."
"The woman had been surprised before at the disappearance of her food , but she was more astonished still when , instead of the plank , she beheld a baby ."
"However , she was fond of children and had none of her own , so she made up her mind that she would keep it and take care of it ."
"The baby grew and throve as no baby in that country had ever done , and in four days he was a man , and as tall and strong as any brave of the tribe ."
"` You have treated me well , ' he said , ` and meat shall never fail to your house ."
"But now I must go , for I have much work to do . '"
Then he set out for his home .
"It took him many days to get there , and when he saw his son sitting in his place his anger was kindled , and his heart was stirred to take vengeance upon him ."
"So he went out quickly into the forest and shed tears , and each tear became a bird ."
"` Stay there till I want you , ' said he ; and he returned to the hut . '"
"I saw some pretty new birds , high up in a tree yonder , ' he remarked ."
And the son answered : ` Show me the way and I will get them for dinner . '
"The two went out together , and after walking for about half an hour they old man stopped ."
"` That is the tree , ' he said ."
And the son began to climb it .
Now a strange thing happened .
"The higher the young man climbed the higher the birds seemed to be , and when he looked down the earth below appeared no bigger than a star ."
"Sill he tried to go back , but he could not , and though he could not see the birds any longer he felt as if something were dragging him up and up ."
"He thought that he had been climbing that tree for days , and perhaps he had , for suddenly a beautiful country , yellow with fields of maize , stretched before him , and he gladly left the top of the tree and entered it ."
"He walked through the maize without knowing where he was going , when he heard a sound of knocking , and saw two old blind women crushing their food between two stones ."
"He crept up to them on tiptoe , and when one old woman passed her dinner to the other he held out his hand and took it and ate if for himself ."
"` How slow you are kneading that cake , ' cried the other old woman at last ."
"` Why , I have given you your dinner , and what more do you want ? '"
replied the second .
"` You did n't ; at least I never got it , ' said the other . '"
I certainly thought you took it from me ; but here is some more . '
And again the young man stretched out his hand ; and the two old women fell to quarrelling afresh .
"But when it happened for the third time the old women suspected some trick , and one of them exclaimed : ' I am sure there is a man here ; tell me , are you not my grandson ? '"
"` Yes , ' answered the young man , who wished to please her , ` and in return for your good dinner I will see if I can not restore your sight ; for I was taught in the art of healing by the best medicine man in the tribe . '"
"And with that he left them , and wandered about till he found the herb which he wanted ."
"Then he hastened back to the old women , and begging them to boil him some water , he threw the herb in ."
"As soon as the pot began to sing he took off the lid , and sprinkled the eyes of the women , and sight came back to them once more ."
"There was no night in that country , so , instead of going to bed very early , as he would have done in his own hut , the young man took another walk ."
"There he sat , lighted up by the flames from the burning house opposite , both hands holding tightly on his red cap , in which lay the treasure ; and now he knew what his heart really valued most -- to whom he really belonged ."
"But when the fire was put out , and the Goblin thought it over -- then -- ' I will divide myself between the two , ' he said . '"
"I can not quite give up the grocer , because of the jam ! '"
And it is just the same with us .
We also can not quite give up the grocer -- because of the jam .
The House in the Wood From the German of Grimm .
A poor woodcutter lived with his wife and three daughters in a little hut on the borders of a great forest .
"One morning as he was going to his work , he said to his wife , ` Let our eldest daughter bring me my lunch into the wood ; and so that she shall not lose her way , I will take a bag of millet with me , and sprinkle the seed on the path . '"
"When the sun had risen high over the forest , the girl set out with a basin of soup ."
"But the field and wood sparrows , the larks and finches , blackbirds and green finches had picked up the millet long ago , and the girl could not find her way ."
"She went on and on , till the sun set and night came on ."
"The trees rustled in the darkness , the owls hooted , and she began to be very much frightened ."
Then she saw in tile distance a light that twinkled between the trees .
"` There must be people living yonder , ' she thought , ` who will take me in for the night , ' and she began walking towards it ."
Not long afterwards she came to a house with lights in the windows .
"She knocked at the door , and a gruff voice called , ` Come in ! '"
"The girl stepped into the dark entrance , and tapped at the door of the room ."
"` Just walk in , ' cried the voice , and when she opened the door there sat an old gray-haired man at the table ."
"His face was resting on his hands , and his white beard flowed over the table almost down to the ground ."
"By the stove lay three beasts , a hen , a cock , and a brindled cow ."
"The girl told the old man her story , and asked for a night 's lodging ."
"The man said : Pretty cock , Pretty hen , And you , pretty brindled cow , What do you say now ?"
"` Duks , ' answered the beasts ; and that must have meant , ` We are quite willing , ' for the old man went on , ` Here is abundance ; go into the back kitchen and cook us a supper . '"
"The girl found plenty of everything in the kitchen , and cooked a good meal , but she did not think of the beasts ."
"She placed the full dishes on the table , sat down opposite the gray-haired man , and ate till her hunger was appeased ."
"When she was satisfied , she said , ` But now I am so tired , where is a bed in which I can sleep ? '"
"The beasts answered : You have eaten with him , You have drunk with him , Of us you have not thought , Sleep then as you ought !"
"Then the old man said , ` Go upstairs , and there you will find a bedroom ; shake the bed , and put clean sheets on , and go to sleep . '"
"The maiden went upstairs , and when she had made the bed , she lay down ."
"After some time the gray-haired man came , looked at her by the light of his candle , and shook his head ."
"And when he saw that she was sound asleep , he opened a trapdoor and let her fall into the cellar ."
"The woodcutter came home late in the evening , and reproached his wife for leaving him all day without food ."
"Once, a wise and good preacher, named Gregory, was walking through the market-place in Rome, when he saw a group of slaves standing there, waiting to be bought. Among these slaves were some pretty boys with long yellow hair, and blue eyes, and white skin. This was a strange sight to Gregory, for most of the people in his land had dark hair, and brown skin."
"""Who are these boys?"" asked he of a man who was standing by."
"""They are Angles from over the sea,"" replied the man."
"""Surely not Angles, but Angels,"" said the preacher, looking kindly into the boys' faces. ""Do they come from England?"""
"""From heathen England, where men do not know the true God,"" said the man."
"""Some day they shall be taught to know God, and then indeed they shall be angels,"" said Gregory."
"Now Gregory did not go away and forget this. When he became a great man and Bishop of Rome, he sent a good preacher, named Augustine, to England, to preach to the people there, and to teach them to be Christians."
Hereward the Wake
"When William of Normandy came over the sea, and took the crown of England, many English people would not call him king. The young lord Hereward was one of these. He and his men made for themselves a ""Camp of Refuge"" among the reeds and rushes on the marshes. All day they lay there, hidden from view by the mists which rose from the watery ground, and at night they came out, and attacked the Normans in their tents, and burned their towns."
"Hereward was called ""the Wake"" because he was so watchful and wide-awake that the Normans could not catch him. They were always trying to find him, but they did not know the safe paths over the marshes which he and his men used, and when they tried to cross, they sank with their horses in the soft muddy ground, and had to turn back."
"But at last a false friend of the English showed them the way to the ""Camp of Refuge"", and then Hereward had to flee to save his life. He went with a few friends to the sea-shore, and there he found some fishermen who were going to sell fish to the Norman guards in an English town."
"The fishermen took Hereward and his men into their boats, and covered them with straw; then they set sail. The Norman guards bought the fish as usual, and had it served for dinner. While they were eating it, the English soldiers came quietly from the boats, and killed most of them before they could get their swords to defend themselves. When the English people in the place saw this, they gladly joined Hereward and made him master of their town."
Canute
"There was once a king of England, named Canute, who was a brave and clever man. But he had many lords in his court who were very foolish."
"They feared their master, and wished to please him, and because they knew that he was somewhat vain of his strength and cleverness, they thought he would like to be told that he was great, and wise, and powerful."
"So they praised him every day, and told him that all he did and all he said was good. They said he was the greatest king on earth, and there was nothing in the world too hard for him to do if he chose. At last King Canute tired of their vain words."
"One day, as he walked with his lords on the sea-shore, one of them told him that even the waves would obey him."
"""Bring a chair,"" said Canute, ""and place it close to the water."""
"The chair was brought, and set upon the sand, and the king sat down and spoke to the waves."
"""I command you to come no farther,"" cried he."
"But the waves came on and on, until they wetted Canute's feet, and splashed his chair."
"Then the king rose and went to his lords, who were standing a little way off, staring at their master, and talking in low tones about his strange conduct."
"""Learn from this to keep your tongues from idle praise,"" said he sternly. ""No king is great and powerful but God. He only can say to the sea: 'Thus far shalt thou come, and no farther.'"""
The Brave Men of Calais
"Many years ago, King Edward III of England took the town of Calais from the French king. He could not take it by force, for the walls were very strong, but he succeeded by another plan. He placed his soldiers all round the walls, and would let no one go into the town to take food to the people. Inside the walls, the people waited bravely, but at last all their food was eaten, and then they knew that if they tried to hold the town any longer they would starve."
"So the governor sent word to King Edward that he would give up the city, and begged him to have mercy on the people."
"But Edward was angry. ""Tell your masters,"" said he to the messenger, ""that I will not spare the people unless six of the chief men come out to me, with their feet bare, and ropes around their necks."""
"At this sad news, the poor starving people cried aloud. But soon six brave men were found who were ready to die for their countrymen, and, with their feet bare and ropes around their necks, they went out to the place where King Edward was waiting, with Queen Philippa and the English nobles."
"""Great king!"" said the men, ""we bring you the keys of our town, and we pray you to have mercy on us."""
"In a gloomy prison, in a foreign land, lay Richard I, King of England."
"He had been with some other kings to a great war in the Holy Land, where he had won battles, and taken cities, and gained much honour. Men called him Richard Lion-heart, because he was as brave as a lion in fighting, and his soldiers loved him and would follow him into any danger. One strong city, called Acre, held out for nearly two years against the armies of the other kings, but when Richard arrived it gave way almost at once."
"Because of his bravery, and his many victories, all men praised King Richard, and this made some of the other kings hate him, for they were jealous that he should have more honour than they. When he was on his way back to England, one of these envious men seized him secretly, and threw him into prison."
"And now poor Richard could fight no more, nor could he see the blue sky, and the green fields which he loved. One day, as he sat sad and lonely in his prison, he heard a voice singing, beneath the window. He started."
"""Surely,"" said he, ""that is the voice of my old friend Blondel, and that is the song we used to sing together."" When the song was ended, the king sang it again in a low voice. Then there was a joyful cry from the man outside, and Richard knew that it was indeed his friend."
"Blondel had journeyed many days seeking his lost master. Now he hastened to England, and told the people where to find their king, and very soon Richard was set free, and went back to his own land."
The White Ship
"The night was dark, and a stormy wind was blowing, when the White Ship set sail from the shore of France. Prince William of England and his sister and their young friends were going back to their own land, after a visit to the French king."
"The English king, Henry I, with his courtiers, had sailed earlier, and had now almost reached home. But the prince would not go with them, he wished to make merry before starting."
"There had been eating, and drinking, and dancing, and singing on board the White Ship, and everyone was merry."
"But the sailors had drunk so much wine that they could not see to steer aright. Soon there was a crash, and the ship trembled. It had struck a rock, and was sinking."
"Then the sounds of merriment were changed to cries of fear. ""Save us!"""
"shrieked the terrified people. ""Save the prince,"" cried the captain, ""the rest of us must die!"" There was only one small boat on the ship, and Prince William was put into this, and rowed away. But he had not gone far, when he heard his sister crying to him to save her."
"""Go back!"" shouted he. The boat was rowed back, but when it came near the ship, so many people jumped into it, that it was overturned and all in it were drowned."
"Soon the White Ship sank also, and of all the gay company upon it only one man was saved."
"When King Henry heard that his only son was dead, he was very sorrowful, and it is said that no man ever again saw a smile upon his face."
Joan of Arc
"In a village in the green country of France, there once lived a girl named Joan. She spent her days in sewing and spinning, and in minding her father's sheep."
"At that time there was a sad war in France, and the English had won many battles. Joan was grieved to hear of the trouble of her country. She thought of it night and day, and one night she dreamt that an angel came, and told her to go and help the French prince."
"When Joan told her friends of this dream, they laughed at her."
"""How can a poor girl help the prince?"" asked they."
"""I do not know,"" replied Joan; ""but I must go, for God has sent me."" So she went to the prince, and said: ""Sir, my name is Joan. God has sent me to help you to win the crown of France."""
"They gave Joan a suit of white armour, and a white horse, and set her at the head of the army. She led the soldiers to fight, and the rough men thought she was an angel, and fought so bravely that they won many battles."
Then the prince was crowned King of France.
"When this was done, Joan felt that her work was over. ""I would that I might go and keep sheep once more with my sisters and my brothers; they would be so glad to see me,"" pleaded she. But the king would not let her go. So Joan stayed; but her time of victory was past. Soon, she was taken prisoner by the English, and cruelly burned to death. She died as bravely as she had lived, and her name will never be forgotten."
AFLOAT WITH A TIGER.
"A traveler in faraway India relates the following thrilling adventure with a tiger: From the heavy rain which falls upon Indian mountains the low-lying country is liable to such sudden floods that every year many beasts, and even human beings, are drowned ere they can make their escape to the higher grounds. On one occasion a terrible flood came up so suddenly that I had to spend a day and night in an open canoe in consequence, during which time I had good opportunities of seeing the good and bad effects produced by them. I lived at the time in a mat house, situated upon a hill which I supposed was quite above high-water mark, but an old Mahometan gentleman having told me that, when he was a little boy, he recollected the water once rising higher than the hill, I took the precaution of keeping a canoe in a small ditch close at hand."
"The rainy season began, and daily the river rose higher. One morning we noticed that the mountain tops were covered with heavy banks of dark clouds, though no rain fell out on the plain where we were; but we noticed many animals, a leopard among others, sneak out of the high grass and make for hilly ground. The most curious thing, however, was the smart manner in which rats and even grasshoppers came scampering away from the threatening danger. These latter came in such crowds toward my bungalow that not only the fowls about the premises had a good feed on them, but kites and crows began to swoop down in such numbers that the air was filled with their cries and the noise of their rushing wings."
"""Now, I'm coming to gobble you up,"" said the Troll."
"""Oh, no! don't take me, wait a little till the big billy-goat Gruff comes, he's much bigger."""
"""Very well! be off with you,"" said the Troll."
But just then up came the big billy-goat Gruff.
"""TRIP, TRAP! TRIP, TRAP! TRIP, TRAP!"" went the bridge, for the billy-goat was so heavy that the bridge creaked and groaned under him."
"""WHO'S THAT tramping over my bridge?"" roared the Troll."
"""IT'S I! THE BIG BILLY-GOAT GRUFF,"" said the billy-goat, who had an ugly hoarse voice of his own."
"""Now, I'm coming to gobble you up,"" roared the Troll."
"""Well, come along! I've got two spears,             And I'll poke your eyeballs out at your ears;             I've got besides two curling-stones,             And I'll crush you to bits, body and bones."""
"That was what the big billy-goat said; and so he flew at the Troll and poked his eyes out with his horns, and crushed him to bits, body and bones, and tossed him out into the burn, and after that he went up to the hill-side. There the billy-goats got so fat they were scarce able to walk home again; and if the fat hasn't fallen off them, why they're still fat; and so:"
"Snip, snap, snout,                         This tale's told out."
THE THREE PRINCESSES IN THE BLUE MOUNTAIN
"There were once upon a time a King and Queen who had no children, and they took it so much to heart that they hardly ever had a happy moment. One day the King stood in the portico and looked out over the big meadows and all that was his. But he felt he could have no enjoyment out of it all, since he did not know what would become of it after his time. As he stood there pondering, an old beggar woman came up to him and asked him for a trifle in heaven's name. She greeted him and curtsied, and asked what ailed the King, since he looked so sad."
"""You can't do anything to help me, my good woman,"" said the King; ""it's no use telling you."""
"""I am not so sure about that,"" said the beggar woman. ""Very little is wanted when luck is in the way. The King is thinking that he has no heir to his crown and kingdom, but he need not mourn on that account,"""
"she said. ""The Queen shall have three daughters, but great care must be taken that they do not come out under the open heavens before they are all fifteen years old; otherwise a snowdrift will come and carry them away."""
"When the time came the Queen had a beautiful baby girl; the year after she had another, and the third year she also had a girl."
"The King and Queen were glad beyond all measure; but although the King was very happy, he did not forget to set a watch at the Palace door, so that the Princesses should not get out."
"As they grew up they became both fair and beautiful, and all went well with them in every way. Their only sorrow was that they were not allowed to go out and play like other children. For all they begged and prayed their parents, and for all they besought the sentinel, it was of no avail; go out they must not before they were fifteen years old, all of them."
"So one day, not long before the fifteenth birthday of the youngest Princess, the King and the Queen were out driving, and the Princesses were standing at the window and looking out. The sun was shining, and everything looked so green and beautiful that they felt that they must go out, happen what might. So they begged and entreated and urged the sentinel, all three of them, that he should let them down into the garden. ""He could see for himself how warm and pleasant it was; no snowy weather could come on such a day."" Well, he didn't think it looked much like it either, and if they must go they had better go, the soldier said; but it must only be for a minute, and he himself would go with them and look after them."
"When they got down into the garden they ran up and down, and filled their laps with flowers and green leaves, the prettiest they could find. At last they could manage no more, but just as they were going indoors they caught sight of a large rose at the other end of the garden. It was many times prettier than any they had gathered, so they must have that also. But just as they bent down to take the rose a big dense snowdrift came and carried them away."
"There was great mourning over the whole country, and the King made known from all the churches that any one who could save the Princesses should have half the kingdom and his golden crown and whichever princess he liked to choose."
"You can well understand there were plenty who wanted to gain half the kingdom, and a princess into the bargain; so there were people of both high and low degree who set out for all parts of the country. But there was no one who could find the Princesses, or even get any tidings of them."
"When all the grand and rich people in the country had had their turn, a captain and a lieutenant came to the Palace, and wanted to try their luck. The King fitted them out both with silver and gold, and wished them success on their journey."
"Then came a soldier, who lived with his mother in a little cottage some way from the Palace. He had dreamt one night that he also was trying to find the Princesses. When the morning came he still remembered what he had dreamt, and told his mother about it."
"""Some witchery must have got hold of you,"" said the woman, ""but you must dream the same thing three nights running, else there is nothing in it."" And the next two nights the same thing happened; he had the same dream, and he felt he must go. So he washed himself and put on his uniform, and went into the kitchen at the Palace. It was the day after the captain and the lieutenant had set out."
"""You had better go home again,"" said the King, ""the Princesses are beyond your reach, I should say; and besides, I have spent so much money on outfits that I have nothing left to-day. You had better come back another time."""
"""If I go, I must go to-day,"" said the soldier. ""Money I do not want; I only need a drop in my flask and some food in my wallet,"" he said; ""but it must be a good walletful as much meat and bacon as I can carry."""
"Yes, that he might have if that was all he wanted."
"So he set off, and he had not gone many miles before he overtook the captain and the lieutenant."
"""Where are you going?"" asked the captain, when he saw the man in uniform."
So the man gave him a pair of snow-shoes.
"""When you get on these,"" he said, ""you'll come to my brother, who lives hundreds of miles off; he is lord over all the birds of the air."
"Ask him. When you reach his house, just turn the shoes so that the toes point this way, and they'll come home of themselves."" So when the King reached the house, he turned the shoes as the lord of the beasts had said, and away they went home of themselves."
"So he asked again after Whiteland, and the man called all the birds with a blast of his horn, and asked if any of them knew where Whiteland lay; but none of the birds knew. Now, long, long after the rest of the birds came an old eagle, which had been away ten round years, but he couldn't tell any more than the rest."
"""Well, well,"" said the man, ""I'll lend you a pair of snow-shoes, and, when you get them on, they'll carry you to my brother, who lives hundreds of miles off; he's lord of all the fish in the sea; you'd better ask him. But don't forget to turn the toes of the shoes this way."""
"The King was full of thanks, got on the shoes, and when he came to the man who was lord over the fish of the sea, he turned the toes round, and so off they went home like the other pair. After that, he asked again after Whiteland."
"So the man called the fish with a blast, but no fish could tell where it lay. At last came an old pike, which they had great work to call home, he was such a way off. So when they asked him he said:"
"""Know it? I should think I did! I've been cook there ten years, and to-morrow I'm going there again; for now the queen of Whiteland, whose king is away, is going to wed another husband."""
"""Well!"" said the man, ""as this is so, I'll give you a bit of advice."
"Hereabouts, on a moor, stand three brothers, and here they have stood these hundred years, fighting about a hat, a cloak, and a pair of boots. If any one has these three things he can make himself invisible, and wish himself anywhere he pleases. You can tell them you wish to try the things, and, after that, you'll pass judgment between them, whose they shall be."""
"Yes! the King thanked the man, and went and did as he told him."
"""What's all this?"" he said to the brothers. ""Why do you stand here fighting for ever and a day? Just let me try these things, and I'll give judgment whose they shall be."""
"They were very willing to do this; but, as soon as he had got the hat, cloak, and boots, he said:"
"""When we meet next time, I'll tell you my judgment,"" and with these words he wished himself away."
"So as he went along up in the air, he came up with the North wind."
"""Whither away?"" roared the North Wind."
"""To Whiteland,"" said the King; and then he told him all that had befallen him."
"""Ah,"" said the North Wind, ""you go faster than I you do; for you can go straight, while I have to puff and blow round every turn and corner. But when you get there, just place yourself on the stairs by the side of the door, and then I'll come storming in, as though I were going to blow down the whole castle. And then when the prince, who is to have your Queen, comes out to see what's the matter, just you take him by the collar and pitch him out of doors; then I'll look after him, and see if I can't carry him off."""
"Well, the King did as the North Wind said. He took his stand on the stairs, and when the North Wind came, storming and roaring, and took hold of the castle wall, so that it shook again, the prince came out to see what was the matter. But as soon as ever he came, the King caught him by the collar and pitched him out of doors, and then the North Wind caught him up and carried him off. So when there was an end of him, the King went into the castle, and at first his Queen didn't know him, he was so wan and thin, through wandering so far and being so woeful; but when he shewed her the ring, she was as glad as glad could be; and so the rightful wedding was held, and the fame of it spread far and wide."
SORIA MORIA CASTLE
"Once on a time there was a poor couple who had a son whose name was Halvor. Ever since he was a little boy he would turn his hand to nothing, but just sat there and groped about in the ashes. His father and mother often put him out to learn this trade or that, but Halvor could stay nowhere; for, when he had been there a day or two, he ran away from his master, and never stopped till he was sitting again in the ingle, poking about in the cinders."
"Well, one day a skipper came, and asked Halvor if he hadn't a mind to be with him, and go to sea, and see strange lands. Yes, Halvor would like that very much; so he wasn't long in getting himself ready."
"How long they sailed I'm sure I can't tell; but the end of it was, they fell into a great storm, and when it was blown over, and it got still again, they couldn't tell where they were; for they had been driven away to a strange coast, which none of them knew anything about."
"Well, as there was just no wind at all, they stayed lying wind-bound there, and Halvor asked the skipper's leave to go on shore and look about him; he would sooner go, he said, than lie there and sleep."
"""Do you think now you're fit to show yourself before folk,"" said the skipper, ""why, you've no clothes but those rags you stand in?"""
"But Halvor stuck to his own, and so at last he got leave, but he was to be sure and come back as soon as ever it began to blow. So off he went and found a lovely land; wherever he came there were fine large flat cornfields and rich meads, but he couldn't catch a glimpse of a living soul. Well, it began to blow, but Halvor thought he hadn't seen enough yet, and he wanted to walk a little farther just to see if he couldn't meet any folk. So after a while he came to a broad high road, so smooth and even, you might easily roll an egg along it."
"Halvor followed this, and when evening drew on he saw a great castle ever so far off, from which the sunbeams shone. So as he had now walked the whole day and hadn't taken a bit to eat with him, he was as hungry as a hunter, but still the nearer he came to the castle, the more afraid he got."
"In the castle kitchen a great fire was blazing, and Halvor went into it, but such a kitchen he had never seen in all his born days. It was so grand and fine; there were vessels of silver and vessels of gold, but still never a living soul. So when Halvor had stood there a while and no one came out, he went and opened a door, and there inside sat a Princess who span upon a spinning-wheel."
"""Nay, nay, now!"" she called out, ""dare Christian folk come hither? But now you'd best be off about your business, if you don't want the Troll to gobble you up; for here lives a Troll with three heads."""
"And to her husband she said, ""My dear, why do you go on worrying about it? Our daughter is not a boy, it is true but she may marry a clever man who could rule your kingdom after you, and learn as much magic as ever you cared to teach him."""
Then the King found his tongue.
"""If she does marry,"" he said, slowly, ""her husband will have to be a very clever man oh, yes, very clever indeed! And he will have to know a very great deal more magic than I shall ever care to teach him."""
The Queen knew at once by the King's tone that he was going to be disagreeable.
"""Ah,"" she said, ""don't punish the child because she loves her mother."""
"""I'm not going to punish her for that,"" said he. ""I'm only going to teach her to respect her father."""
"And without another word he went off to his laboratory and worked all night, boiling different-colored things in crucibles, and copying charms in curious twisted letters from old brown books with mold stains on their yellowy pages."
"The next day his plan was all arranged. He took the poor Princess to the Lone Tower, which stands on an island in the sea, a thousand miles from everywhere. He gave her a dowry, and settled a handsome income on her."
"He engaged a competent dragon to look after her, and also a respectable griffin whose birth and upbringing he knew all about. And he said: ""Here you shall stay, my dear, respectful daughter, till the clever man comes to marry you. He'll have to be clever enough to sail a ship through the Nine Whirlpools that spin around the island, and to kill the dragon and the griffin. Till he comes you'll never get any older or any wiser. No doubt he will soon come. You can employ yourself in embroidering your wedding gown. I wish you joy, my dutiful child."""
"And his carriage, drawn by live thunderbolts (thunder travels very fast), rose in the air and disappeared, and the poor Princess was left, with the dragon and the griffin, on the Island of the Nine Whirlpools."
"The Queen, left at home, cried for a day and a night, and then she remembered the witch and called to her. And the witch came, and the Queen told her all."
"""For the sake of the twice twenty-five kisses you gave me,"" said the witch, ""I will help you. But it is the last thing I can do, and it is not much. Your daughter is under a spell, and I can take you to her."
"But, if I do, you will have to be turned to stone, and to stay so till the spell is taken off the child."""
"""I would be a stone for a thousand years,"" said the poor Queen, ""if at the end of them I could see my dear again."""
"So the witch took the Queen in a carriage drawn by live sunbeams (which travel more quickly than anything else in the world, and much quicker than thunder), and so away and away to the Lone Tower on the Island of the Nine Whirlpools. And there was the Princess sitting on the floor in the best room of the Lone Tower, crying as if her heart would break, and the dragon and the griffin were sitting primly on each side of her."
"""Oh, Mother, Mother, Mother,"" she cried, and hung around the Queen's neck as if she would never let go."
"""Now,"" said the witch, when they had all cried as much as was good for them, ""I can do one or two other little things for you. Time shall not make the Princess sad. All days will be like one day till her deliverer comes. And you and I, dear Queen, will sit in stone at the gate of the tower. In doing this for you I lose all my witch's powers, and when I say the spell that changes you to stone, I shall change with you, and if ever we come out of the stone, I shall be a witch no more, but only a happy old woman."""
"Then the three kissed one another again and again, and the witch said the spell, and on each side of the door there was now a stone lady. One of them had a stone crown on its head and a stone scepter in its hand; but the other held a stone tablet with words on it, which the griffin and the dragon could not read, though they had both had a very good education."
"And now all days seemed like one day to the Princess, and the next day always seemed the day when her mother would come out of the stone and kiss her again. And the years went slowly by. The wicked King died, and some one else took his kingdom, and many things were changed in the world; but the island did not change, nor the Nine Whirlpools, nor the griffin, nor the dragon, nor the two stone ladies. And all the time, from the very first, the day of the Princess's deliverance was coming, creeping nearer, and nearer, and nearer. But no one saw it coming except the Princess, and she only in dreams. And the years went by in tens and in hundreds, and still the Nine Whirlpools spun around, roaring in triumph the story of many a good ship that had gone down in their swirl, bearing with it some Prince who had tried to win the Princess and her dowry. And the great sea knew all the other stories of the Princes who had come from very far, and had seen the whirlpools, and had shaken their wise young heads and said: ""'Bout ship!"" and gone discreetly home to their nice, safe, comfortable kingdoms."
But no one told the story of the deliverer who was to come. And the years went by.
"Now, after more scores of years than you would like to add up on your slate, a certain sailor-boy sailed on the high seas with his uncle, who was a skilled skipper. And the boy could reef a sail and coil a rope and keep the ship's nose steady before the wind. And he was as good a boy as you would find in a month of Sundays, and worthy to be a Prince."
"Now there is Something which is wiser than all the world and it knows when people are worthy to be Princes. And this Something came from the farther side of the seventh world, and whispered in the boy's ear."
"And the boy heard, though he did not know he heard, and he looked out over the black sea with the white foam-horses galloping over it, and far away he saw a light. And he said to the skipper, his uncle: ""What light is that?"""
"Then the skipper said: ""All good things defend you, Nigel, from sailing near that light. It is not mentioned in all charts; but it is marked in the old chart I steer by, which was my father's father's before me, and his father's father's before him. It is the light that shines from the Lone Tower that stands above the Nine Whirlpools. And when my father's father was young he heard from the very old man, his great-great-grandfather, that in that tower an enchanted Princess, fairer than the day, waits to be delivered. But there is no deliverance, so never steer that way; and think no more of the Princess, for that is only an idle tale. But the whirlpools are quite real."""
"So, of course, from that day Nigel thought of nothing else. And as he sailed hither and thither upon the high seas he saw from time to time the light that shone out to sea across the wild swirl of the Nine Whirlpools. And one night, when the ship was at anchor and the skipper asleep in his bunk, Nigel launched the ship's boat and steered alone over the dark sea towards the light. He dared not go very near till daylight should show him what, indeed, were the whirlpools he had to dread."
"But when the dawn came he saw the Lone Tower standing dark against the pink and primrose of the East, and about its base the sullen swirl of black water, and he heard the wonderful roar of it. So he hung off and on, all that day and for six days besides. And when he had watched seven days he knew something. For you are certain to know something if you give for seven days your whole thought to it, even though it be only the first declension, or the nine-times table, or the dates of the Norman Kings."
"What he knew was this: that for five minutes out of the 1,440 minutes that make up a day the whirlpools slipped into silence, while the tide went down and left the yellow sand bare. And every day this happened, but every day it was five minutes earlier than it had been the day before. He made sure of this by the ship's chronometer, which he had thoughtfully brought with him."
See page 88.]
"So on the eighth day, at five minutes before noon, Nigel got ready. And when the whirlpools suddenly stopped whirling and the tide sank, like water in a basin that has a hole in it, he stuck to his oars and put his back into his stroke, and presently beached the boat on the yellow sand. Then he dragged it into a cave, and sat down to wait."
"By five minutes and one second past noon, the whirlpools were black and busy again, and Nigel peeped out of his cave. And on the rocky ledge overhanging the sea he saw a Princess as beautiful as the day, with golden hair and a green gown and he went out to meet her."
"""I've come to save you,"" he said. ""How darling and beautiful you are!"""
"For some time they had fair wind and fine weather, but after that they lay wind-bound under a rocky island. So the sailors went ashore and strolled about to spend the time, and there they found a huge egg, almost as big as a little house. So they began to knock it about with large stones, but, after all, they couldn't crack the shell. Then the lad came up with his sword to see what all the noise was about, and when he saw the egg, he thought it a trifle to crack it; so he gave it one blow and the egg split, and out came a chicken as big as an elephant."
"""Now we have done wrong,"" said the lad; ""this can cost us all our lives;"" and then he asked his sailors if they were men enough to sail to Arabia in four-and-twenty hours if they got a fine breeze. Yes!"
"they were good to do that, they said, so they set sail with a fine breeze, and got to Arabia in three-and-twenty hours. As soon as they landed, the lad ordered all the sailors to go and bury themselves up to the eyes in a sandhill, so that they could barely see the ships."
The lad and the captains climbed a high crag and sate down under a fir.
"In a little while came a great bird flying with an island in its claws, and let it fall down on the fleet, and sunk every ship. After it had done that, it flew up to the sandhill and flapped its wings, so that the wind nearly took off the heads of the sailors, and it flew past the fir with such force that it turned the lad right about, but he was ready with his sword, and gave the bird one blow and brought it down dead."
"After that he went to the town, where every one was glad because the King had got his daughter back; but now the King had hidden her away somewhere himself, and promised her hand as a reward to any one who could find her, and this though she was betrothed before. Now as the lad went along he met a man who had white bear-skins for sale, so he bought one of the hides and put it on; and one of the captains was to take an iron chain and lead him about, and so he went into the town and began to play pranks. At last the news came to the King's ears, that there never had been such fun in the town before, for here was a white bear that danced and cut capers just as it was bid. So a messenger came to say the bear must come to the castle at once, for the King wanted to see its tricks. So when it got to the castle every one was afraid, for such a beast they had never seen before; but the captain said there was no danger unless they laughed at it. They mustn't do that, else it would tear them to pieces. When the King heard that, he warned all the court not to laugh. But while the fun was going on, in came one of the King's maids, and began to laugh and make game of the bear, and the bear flew at her and tore her, so that there was scarce a rag of her left. Then all the court began to bewail, and the captain most of all."
"""Stuff and nonsense,"" said the King; ""she's only a maid, besides it's more my affair than yours."""
"When the show was over, it was late at night. ""It's no good your going away, when it's so late,"" said the King. ""The bear had best sleep here."""
"""Perhaps it might sleep in the ingle by the kitchen fire,"" said the captain."
"""Nay,"" said the King, ""it shall sleep up here, and it shall have pillows and cushions to sleep on."" So a whole heap of pillows and cushions was brought, and the captain had a bed in a side room."
"But at midnight the King came with a lamp in his hand and a big bunch of keys, and carried off the white bear. He passed along gallery after gallery through doors and rooms, up-stairs and down-stairs, till at last he came to a pier which ran out into the sea. Then the King began to pull and haul at posts and pins, this one up and that one down, till at last a little house floated up to the water's edge."
"There he kept his daughter, for she was so dear to him that he had hid her, so that no one could find her out. He left the white bear outside while he went in and told her how it had danced and played its pranks."
"She said she was afraid, and dared not look at it; but he talked her over, saying there was no danger if she only wouldn't laugh. So they brought the bear in, and locked the door, and it danced and played its tricks; but just when the fun was at its height, the Princess's maid began to laugh. Then the lad flew at her and tore her to bits, and the Princess began to cry and sob."
"""Stuff and nonsense,"" cried the King; ""all this fuss about a maid!"
"I'll get you just as good a one again. But now I think the bear had best stay here till morning, for I don't care to have to go and lead it along all those galleries and stairs at this time of night."""
"""Well!"" said the Princess, ""if it sleeps here, I'm sure I won't."""
"But just then the bear curled himself up and lay down by the stove; and it was settled at last that the Princess should sleep there too, with a light burning. But as soon as the King had well gone, the white bear came and begged her to undo his collar. The Princess was so scared she almost swooned away; but she felt about till she found the collar, and she had scarce undone it before the bear pulled his head off. Then she knew him again, and was so glad there was no end to her joy, and she wanted to tell her father at once that her deliverer was come. But the lad would not hear of it; he would earn her once more, he said. So in the morning when they heard the King rattling at the posts outside, the lad drew on the hide and lay down by the stove."
"""Well, has it lain still?"" the king asked."
"""I should think so,"" said the Princess; ""it hasn't so much as turned or stretched itself once."""
"When they got up to the castle again, the captain took the bear and led it away, and then the lad threw off the hide, and went to a tailor and ordered clothes fit for a prince; and when they were fitted on he went to the King, and said he wanted to find the Princess."
"""You're not the first who has wished the same thing,"" said the King, ""but they have all lost their lives; for if any one who tries can't find her in four-and-twenty hours his life is forfeited."""
"Yes; the lad knew all that. Still he wished to try, and if he couldn't find her, 'twas his look-out. Now in the castle there was a band that played sweet tunes, and there were fair maids to dance with, and so the lad danced away."
"When twelve hours were gone, the King said:"
"""I pity you with all my heart. You're so poor a hand at seeking; you will surely lose your life."""
"""Stuff!"" said the lad; ""while there's life there's hope! So long as there's breath in the body there's no fear; we have lots of time!"" and so he went on dancing till there was only one hour left."
Then he said he would begin to search.
"""It's no use now,"" said the King; ""time's up."""
"""Light your lamp; out with your big bunch of keys,"" said the lad, ""and follow me whither I wish to go. There is still a whole hour left."""
"So the lad went the same way which the King had led him the night before, and he bade the King unlock door after door till they came down to the pier which ran out into the sea."
"""It's all no use, I tell you,"" said the King; ""time's up, and this will only lead you right out into the sea."""
"""Still five minutes more,"" said the lad, as he pulled and pushed at the posts and pins, and the house floated up."
"They began one nest and had it nearly done, when Mr. Goldfinch said it was not in a good place, and tore it all to pieces. Mrs. Goldfinch felt very badly about this and talked it over with some of her Goldfinch neighbors. They told her not to mind it at all, that their husbands often did the same thing, and that sometimes they came to like the new place much better than the old. At any rate, there was no use in getting cross about it, because that was something she would have to expect."
"Mr. Goldfinch was sure that they had built too near the ground, and he had chosen a crotch above. Toward this he was dragging the bits of grape-vine and cedar-bark which were woven into their first nest. He said they could also use some of the grasses and mosses which they had gotten together, and he even told his wife of some fine thistle-down which he could bring for the inside, where the eggs were to be laid."
"Mrs. Goldfinch watched him tugging with bill and both feet to loosen the bits of bark, and she said to herself: ""Dear fellow! what a helper he is! I won't mind rebuilding if it makes him happy,"" and she went to work with a will."
"When the sun went down in the west the next night the second nest was done, and it was the last thing at which the Goldfinches looked before tucking their heads under their wings and going to sleep. It was the first thing that they saw the next morning, too, and they hopped all around it and twittered with pride, and gave it little tweaks here and little pokes there before they flew away to get breakfast."
"While they were gone, Mrs. Cowbird came walking over the grass and dry leaves to the foot of the tree. She wagged her head at every step, and put on as many airs as though she were showily dressed, instead of wearing, as she always does, a robe of dull brownish gray. She had seen the Goldfinches fly away, and she was looking for their home. She was a lazy creature in spite of her stirring ways, and she wished to find a nice little nest in which to lay an egg. You know Cowbirds never think of building nests. They want all of their time to take care of themselves, which is a very foolish way of living; but then, you could never make a Cowbird think so!"
"""That nest is exactly right,"" said Mrs. Cowbird. ""I will lay my egg there at once, and when Mrs. Goldfinch has laid hers she will have to hatch them all together and take care of my baby for me. What an easy way this is to bring up one's family! It is really no work at all! And I am sure that my children will get along well, because I am always careful to choose the nests of small birds for them. Then they are larger and stronger than the other babies, and can get more than their share of food."""
"So she laid a big white egg with gray and brown spots on it in the Goldfinches' new home, and then she flew off to the Cowbird flock, as gay and careless as you please. When the Goldfinches came back, they saw the egg in their nest and called all their neighbors to talk it over."
"""What shall I ever do?"" said Mrs. Goldfinch. ""I wanted my nest for my own eggs, and I meant to lay them to-morrow. I suppose I shall have to sit on this one too, but it won't be at all comfortable."""
"""I wouldn't,"" said one of her neighbors, a Yellow Warbler. ""I left my nest once when such a thing happened to me, and built a new one for my own eggs."""
"""Oh dear!"" cried Mrs. Goldfinch, ""we have built two already, and I cannot build another."""
"""Well, whatever you do,"" said a Vireo, ""don't hatch the big egg out with your own. I did once, and such a time as I had! The young Cowbird pushed two of my little Vireos out onto the ground, and ate so much that I was quite worn out by the work of hunting for him."""
"""My dear,"" said Mr. Goldfinch, ""I have an excellent plan. We will put another floor in our nest, right over this egg, and then by adding a bit all around the sides we can have plenty of room for our own children. It will be much less work than beginning all over again, and then the Cowbird's egg will be too cool to hatch."""
"Everybody called this a most clever plan, and Mr. Goldfinch was very proud to have thought of it. They went to work once more, and it was not so very long before the new floor was done and the new walls raised."
"Then, oh, wonder of wonders! there were soon four tiny, pearly eggs of their own lying on the thistle-down lining of the nest."
"Mrs. Goldfinch had to stay very closely at home now, but her husband went off with his friends a great deal. He bathed and sang and preened his feathers and talked about his queer nest and his bright little wife, after the manner of Goldfinches everywhere."
"His friends laughed at him for helping so much about the nest, for, you know, Goldfinches do not often help their wives about home. He cocked his handsome head on one side and answered: ""My wife seemed to need me then. She is not so very strong. And I do not know what she would ever have done about the strange egg, if I had not been there to advise her."""
"When he got back to his home that night, Mrs. Goldfinch said: ""I have been wondering why we did not roll the Cowbird's egg out on the ground, instead of going to all that trouble of building around it."""
"And Mr. Goldfinch declared that he believed she was the only bird who had ever thought of such a thing. ""It could have been done just as well as not,"" he said. ""I must tell that to the other birds in the morning."
"How lucky I am to have such a bright wife! It would be dreadful if such a clever fellow as I had a dull mate!"""
MRS. MOURNING DOVE'S HOUSEKEEPING
"Strange as it may seem, there had never been any Mourning Doves in the forest until this year, and when a pair came there to live, the people were much excited. They talked about the Doves' song, so sweet and sad, and about their soft coats of brown and gray, and they wondered very much what kind of home they would build. Would it be a swinging pocket of hairs, strings, and down, like that of the Orioles? Would it be stout and heavy like the nests of the Robins? Or would it be a ball of leaves and grasses on the ground, with a tiny doorway in one side, like that of the Ovenbird?"
"You can see that the forest people were really very much interested in the Mourning Doves, and so, perhaps, it is not strange that, when the new couple built their nest in the lower branches of a spruce tree, everybody watched it and talked about it."
"""Really,"" said one of the Blackbirds, who had flown over from the swamp near by, ""I never should think of calling that thing a nest! It is nothing but a few twigs and sticks laid together. It is just as flat as a maple-leaf, and what is to keep those poor little Doves from tumbling to the ground I can't see."""
"""I wouldn't worry about the little Doves yet,"" said a Warbler. ""I don't think there will ever be any little Doves in that nest. The eggs will roll off of it long before they are ready to hatch, and the nest will blow to pieces in the first storm we have."""
"""Well,"" said the Blackbird, as she started for home, ""I shall want to know how the Mourning Doves get on. If any of you are over my way, stop and tell me the news."""
"Some days after this, a Quail, passing under the Doves' home, happened to look up and see two white eggs in the nest. It was so very thin that she could see them quite plainly through the openings between the twigs."
"Later in the day, she spoke of this to a Grouse, saying, ""I came by the Mourning Doves' nest and saw two white eggs through the bottom."""
"After she went away, the Grouse said to a wild Rabbit: ""The Quail told me that the Mourning Dove's eggs went right through the bottom of her nest, and I don't wonder. It wasn't strong enough to hold anything."""
"At sunset, the Rabbit had a short visit with Mrs. Goldfinch, as she pulled a great thistle-head to pieces and made her supper from its seeds. He told her he had heard that the Mourning Dove's eggs had fallen through the bottom of the nest and broken on the ground, and Mrs."
"Goldfinch said: ""Oh, that poor Mrs. Mourning Dove! I must go to see her in the morning."" Then she fled home to her own four pearly treasures."
"Now, of course the Rabbit was mistaken when he said anybody had told him that those two eggs were broken; just as much mistaken as the Grouse was when she said somebody had told her that the eggs had fallen. They both thought they were right, but they were careless listeners and careless talkers, and so each one had changed it a bit in the telling."
"""I'm going to try if I can find the Princesses,"" answered the soldier."
"""So are we,"" said the captain, ""and since your errand is the same, you may keep company with us, for if we don't find them, you are not likely to find them either, my lad,"" said he."
"When they had gone awhile the soldier left the high road, and took a path into the forest."
"""Where are you going?"" said the captain; ""it is best to follow the high road."""
"""That may be,"" said the soldier, ""but this is my way."""
"He kept to the path, and when the others saw this they turned round and followed him. Away they went further and further, far across big moors and along narrow valleys."
"And at last it became lighter, and when they had got out of the forest altogether they came to a long bridge, which they had to cross. But on that bridge a bear stood on guard. He rose on his hind legs and came towards them, as if he wanted to eat them."
"""What shall we do now?"" said the captain."
"""They say that the bear is fond of meat,"" said the soldier, and then he threw a fore quarter to him, and so they got past. But when they reached the other end of the bridge, they saw a lion, which came roaring towards them with open jaws as if he wanted to swallow them."
"""I think we had better turn right-about, we shall never be able to get past him alive,"" said the captain."
"""Oh, I don't think he is so very dangerous,"" said the soldier; ""I have heard that lions are very fond of bacon, and I have half a pig in my wallet;"" and then he threw a ham to the lion, who began eating and gnawing, and thus they got past him also."
"In the evening they came to a fine big house. Each room was more gorgeous than the other; all was glitter and splendour wherever they looked; but that did not satisfy their hunger. The captain and the lieutenant went round rattling their money, and wanted to buy some food; but they saw no people nor could they find a crumb of anything in the house, so the soldier offered them some food from his wallet, which they were not too proud to accept, nor did they want any pressing. They helped themselves of what he had as if they had never tasted food before."
The next day the captain said they would have to go out shooting and try to get something to live upon. Close to the house was a large forest where there were plenty of hares and birds. The lieutenant was to remain at home and cook the remainder of the food in the soldier's wallet. In the meantime the captain and the soldier shot so much game that they were hardly able to carry it home. When they came to the door they found the lieutenant in such a terrible plight that he was scarcely able to open the door to them.
"""What is the matter with you?"" said the captain. The lieutenant then told them that as soon as they were gone a tiny, little man, with a long beard, who went on crutches, came in and asked so plaintively for a penny; but no sooner had he got it than he let it fall on the floor, and for all he raked and scraped with his crutch he was not able to get hold of it, so stiff and stark was he."
"""I pitied the poor, old body,"" said the lieutenant, ""and so I bent down to pick up the penny, but then he was neither stiff nor stark any longer. He began to belabour me with his crutches till very soon I was unable to move a limb."""
"""You ought to be ashamed of yourself! you, one of the king's officers, to let an old cripple give you a thrashing, and then tell people of it into the bargain!"" said the captain. ""Pshaw! to-morrow I'll stop at home, and then you'll hear another story."""
The next day the lieutenant and the soldier went out shooting and the captain remained at home to do the cooking and look after the house.
"But if he fared no worse, he certainly fared no better than the lieutenant. In a little while the old man came in and asked for a penny. He let it fall as soon as he got it; gone it was and could not be found. So he asked the captain to help him to find it, and the captain, without giving a thought, bent down to look for it. But no sooner was he on his knees than the cripple began belabouring him with his crutches, and every time the captain tried to rise, he got a blow which sent him reeling. When the others came home in the evening, he still lay on the same spot and could neither see nor speak."
"The third day the soldier was to remain at home, while the other two went out shooting. The captain said he must take care of himself, ""for the old fellow will soon put an end to you, my lad,"" said he."
"""Oh, there can't be much life in one if such an old crook can take it,"" said the soldier."
"They were no sooner outside the door, than the old man came in and asked for a penny again."
"""Money I have never owned,"" said the soldier, ""but food I'll give you, as soon as it is ready,"" said he, ""but if we are to get it cooked, you must go and cut the wood."""
"""That I can't,"" said the old man."
"""If you can't, you must learn,"" said the soldier. ""I will soon show you. Come along with me down to the wood-shed."" There he dragged out a heavy log and cut a cleft in it, and drove in a wedge till the cleft deepened."
"""Now you must lie down and look right along the cleft, and you'll soon learn how to cut wood,"" said the soldier. ""In the meantime I'll show you how to use the axe."""
"The old man was not sufficiently cunning, and did as he was told; he lay down and looked steadily along the log. When the soldier saw the old man's beard had got well into the cleft, he struck out the wedge; the cleft closed and the old man was caught by the beard. The soldier began to beat him with the axe handle, and then swung the axe round his head, and vowed that he would split his skull if he did not tell him, there and then, where the Princesses were."
"""Spare my life, spare my life, and I'll tell you!"" said the old man."
"""To the east of the house there is a big mound; on top of the mound you must dig out a square piece of turf, and then you will see a big stone slab. Under that there is a deep hole through which you must let yourself down, and you'll then come to another world where you will find the Princesses. But the way is long and dark and it goes both through fire and water."""
"When the soldier got to know this, he released the old man, who was not long in making off."
"When the captain and lieutenant came home they were surprised to find the soldier alive. He told them what had happened from first to last, where the Princesses were and how they should find them. They became as pleased as if they had already found them, and when they had had some food, they took with them a basket and as much rope as they could find, and all three set off to the mound. There they first dug out the turf just as the old man had told them, and underneath they found a big stone slab, which it took all their strength to turn over."
"They then began to measure how deep it was; they joined on ropes both two and three times, but they were no nearer the bottom the last time than the first. At last they had to join all the ropes they had, both the coarse and fine, and then they found it reached the bottom."
"The captain was, of course, the first who wanted to descend; ""But when I tug at the rope you must make haste to drag me up again,"" he said."
"""Well?"" cried the tiger impatiently."
"""Please, my lord! how did you get in?"""
"""How! why in the usual way, of course!"""
"""Oh, dear me! my head is beginning to whirl again! Please don't be angry, my lord, but what is the usual way?"""
"At this the tiger lost patience, and, jumping into the cage, cried, ""This way! Now do you understand how it was?"""
"""Perfectly!"" grinned the jackal, as he dexterously shut the door, ""and if you will permit me to say so, I think matters will remain as they were!"""
The Soothsayer's Son
"A soothsayer when on his deathbed wrote out the horoscope of his second son, whose name was Gangazara, and bequeathed it to him as his only property, leaving the whole of his estate to his eldest son. The second son thought over the horoscope, and said to himself:"
"""Alas! am I born to this only in the world? The sayings of my father never failed. I have seen them prove true to the last word while he was living; and how has he fixed my horoscope! 'FROM MY BIRTH POVERTY!' Nor is that my only fate. 'FOR TEN YEARS, IMPRISONMENT' a fate harder than poverty; and what comes next? 'DEATH ON THE SEA-SHORE'; which means that I must die away from home, far from friends and relatives on a sea-coast. Now comes the most curious part of the horoscope, that I am to 'HAVE SOME HAPPINESS AFTERWARDS!' What this happiness is, is an enigma to me."""
"Thus thought he, and after all the funeral obsequies of his father were over, took leave of his elder brother, and started for Benares."
"He went by the middle of the Deccan, avoiding both the coasts, and went on journeying and journeying for weeks and months, till at last he reached the Vindhya mountains. While passing that desert he had to journey for a couple of days through a sandy plain, with no signs of life or vegetation. The little store of provision with which he was provided for a couple of days, at last was exhausted. The chombu, which he carried always full, filling it with the sweet water from the flowing rivulet or plenteous tank, he had exhausted in the heat of the desert. There was not a morsel in his hand to eat; nor a drop of water to drink. Turn his eyes wherever he might he found a vast desert, out of which he saw no means of escape. Still he thought within himself, ""Surely my father's prophecy never proved untrue. I must survive this calamity to find my death on some sea-coast."" So thought he, and this thought gave him strength of mind to walk fast and try to find a drop of water somewhere to slake his dry throat."
"At last he succeeded; heaven threw in his way a ruined well. He thought he could collect some water if he let down his chombu with the string that he always carried noosed to the neck of it. Accordingly he let it down; it went some way and stopped, and the following words came from the well: ""Oh, relieve me! I am the king of tigers, dying here of hunger. For the last three days I have had nothing. Fortune has sent you here. If you assist me now you will find a sure help in me throughout your life. Do not think that I am a beast of prey. When you have become my deliverer I will never touch you. Pray, kindly lift me up."" Gangazara thought: ""Shall I take him out or not? If I take him out he may make me the first morsel of his hungry mouth. No; that he will not do. For my father's prophecy never came untrue. I must die on a sea coast, and not by a tiger."" Thus thinking, he asked the tiger-king to hold tight to the vessel, which he accordingly did, and he lifted him up slowly. The tiger reached the top of the well and felt himself on safe ground. True to his word, he did no harm to Gangazara. On the other hand, he walked round his patron three times, and standing before him, humbly spoke the following words: ""My life-giver, my benefactor! I shall never forget this day, when I regained my life through your kind hands. In return for this kind assistance I pledge my oath to stand by you in all calamities."
"Whenever you are in any difficulty just think of me. I am there with you ready to oblige you by all the means that I can. To tell you briefly how I came in here: Three days ago I was roaming in yonder forest, when I saw a goldsmith passing through it. I chased him. He, finding it impossible to escape my claws, jumped into this well, and is living to this moment in the very bottom of it. I also jumped in, but found myself on the first ledge of the well; he is on the last and fourth ledge. In the second lives a serpent half-famished with hunger."
"On the third lies a rat, also half-famished, and when you again begin to draw water these may request you first to release them. In the same way the goldsmith also may ask you. I beg you, as your bosom friend, never assist that wretched man, though he is your relation as a human being. Goldsmiths are never to be trusted. You can place more faith in me, a tiger, though I feast sometimes upon men, in a serpent, whose sting makes your blood cold the very next moment, or in a rat, which does a thousand pieces of mischief in your house. But never trust a goldsmith. Do not release him; and if you do, you shall surely repent of it one day or other."" Thus advising, the hungry tiger went away without waiting for an answer."
"Gangazara thought several times of the eloquent way in which the tiger spoke, and admired his fluency of speech. But still his thirst was not quenched. So he let down his vessel again, which was now caught hold of by the serpent, who addressed him thus: ""Oh, my protector! Lift me up. I am the king of serpents, and the son of Adisesha, who is now pining away in agony for my disappearance. Release me now. I shall ever remain your servant, remember your assistance, and help you throughout life in all possible ways. Oblige me: I am dying."""
"Gangazara, calling again to mind the ""DEATH ON THE SEA-SHORE"" of the prophecy lifted him up. He, like the tiger-king, walked round him thrice, and prostrating himself before him spoke thus: ""Oh, my life-giver, my father, for so I must call you, as you have given me another birth. I was three days ago basking myself in the morning sun, when I saw a rat running before me. I chased him. He fell into this well. I followed him, but instead of falling on the third storey where he is now lying, I fell into the second. I am going away now to see my father. Whenever you are in any difficulty just think of me. I will be there by your side to assist you by all possible means."" So saying, the Nagaraja glided away in zigzag movements, and was out of sight in a moment."
"The poor son of the Soothsayer, who was now almost dying of thirst, let down his vessel for a third time. The rat caught hold of it, and without discussing he lifted up the poor animal at once. But it would not go away without showing its gratitude: ""Oh, life of my life! My benefactor! I am the king of rats. Whenever you are in any calamity just think of me. I will come to you, and assist you. My keen ears overheard all that the tiger-king told you about the goldsmith, who is in the fourth storey. It is nothing but a sad truth that goldsmiths ought never to be trusted. Therefore, never assist him as you have done to us all. And if you do, you will suffer for it. I am hungry; let me go for the present."" Thus taking leave of his benefactor, the rat, too, ran away."
"Gangazara for a while thought upon the repeated advice given by the three animals about releasing the goldsmith: ""What wrong would there be in my assisting him? Why should I not release him also?"" So thinking to himself, Gangazara let down the vessel again. The goldsmith caught hold of it, and demanded help. The Soothsayer's son had no time to lose; he was himself dying of thirst. Therefore he lifted the goldsmith up, who now began his story. ""Stop for a while,"""
"said Gangazara, and after quenching his thirst by letting down his vessel for the fifth time, still fearing that some one might remain in the well and demand his assistance, he listened to the goldsmith, who began as follows: ""My dear friend, my protector, what a deal of nonsense these brutes have been talking to you about me; I am glad you have not followed their advice. I am just now dying of hunger. Permit me to go away. My name is Manikkasari. I live in the East main street of Ujjaini, which is twenty kas to the south of this place, and so lies on your way when you return from Benares. Do not forget to come to me and receive my kind remembrances of your assistance, on your way back to your country."" So saying, the goldsmith took his leave, and Gangazara also pursued his way north after the above adventures."
"He reached Benares, and lived there for more than ten years, and quite forgot the tiger, serpent, rat, and goldsmith. After ten years of religious life, thoughts of home and of his brother rushed into his mind. ""I have secured enough merit now by my religious observances."
"Let me return home."" Thus thought Gangazara within himself, and very soon he was on his way back to his country. Remembering the prophecy of his father he returned by the same way by which he went to Benares ten years before. While thus retracing his steps he reached the ruined well where he had released the three brute kings and the goldsmith. At once the old recollections rushed into his mind, and he thought of the tiger to test his fidelity. Only a moment passed, and the tiger-king came running before him carrying a large crown in his mouth, the glitter of the diamonds of which for a time outshone even the bright rays of the sun. He dropped the crown at his life-giver's feet, and, putting aside all his pride, humbled himself like a pet cat to the strokes of his protector, and began in the following words: ""My life-giver! How is it that you have forgotten me, your poor servant, for such a long time? I am glad to find that I still occupy a corner in your mind. I can never forget the day when I owed my life to your lotus hands. I have several jewels with me of little value. This crown, being the best of all, I have brought here as a single ornament of great value, which you can carry with you and dispose of in your own country."" Gangazara looked at the crown, examined it over and over, counted and recounted the gems, and thought within himself that he would become the richest of men by separating the diamonds and gold, and selling them in his own country. He took leave of the tiger-king, and after his disappearance thought of the kings of serpents and rats, who came in their turn with their presents, and after the usual greetings and exchange of words took their leave."
"Gangazara was extremely delighted at the faithfulness with which the brute beasts behaved, and went on his way to the south. While going along he spoke to himself thus: ""These beasts have been very faithful in their assistance. Much more, therefore, must Manikkasari be faithful. I do not want anything from him now. If I take this crown with me as it is, it occupies much space in my bundle. It may also excite the curiosity of some robbers on the way. I will go now to Ujjaini on my way. Manikkasari requested me to see him without failure on my return journey. I shall do so, and request him to have the crown melted, the diamonds and gold separated. He must do that kindness at least for me. I shall then roll up these diamonds and gold ball in my rags, and wend my way homewards."" Thus thinking and thinking, he reached Ujjaini. At once he inquired for the house of his goldsmith friend, and found him without difficulty. Manikkasari was extremely delighted to find on his threshold him who ten years before, notwithstanding the advice repeatedly given him by the sage-looking tiger, serpent, and rat, had relieved him from the pit of death."
"Gangazara at once showed him the crown that he received from the tiger-king, told him how he got it, and requested his kind assistance to separate the gold and diamonds. Manikkasari agreed to do so, and meanwhile asked his friend to rest himself for a while to have his bath and meals; and Gangazara, who was very observant of his religious ceremonies, went direct to the river to bathe."
"How came the crown in the jaws of the tiger? The king of Ujjaini had a week before gone with all his hunters on a hunting expedition. All of a sudden the tiger-king started from the wood, seized the king, and vanished."
"When the king's attendants informed the prince about the death of his father he wept and wailed, and gave notice that he would give half of his kingdom to any one who should bring him news about the murderer of his father. The goldsmith knew full well that it was a tiger that killed the king, and not any hunter's hands, since he had heard from Gangazara how he obtained the crown. Still, he resolved to denounce Gangazara as the king's murderer, so, hiding the crown under his garments, he flew to the palace. He went before the prince and informed him that the assassin was caught, and placed the crown before him. The prince took it into his hands, examined it, and at once gave half the kingdom to Manikkasari, and then inquired about the murderer."
"""He is bathing in the river, and is of such and such appearance,"" was the reply. At once four armed soldiers flew to the river, and bound the poor Brahman hand and foot, while he, sitting in meditation, was without any knowledge of the fate that hung over him. They brought Gangazara to the presence of the prince, who turned his face away from the supposed murderer, and asked his soldiers to throw him into a dungeon. In a minute, without knowing the cause, the poor Brahman found himself in the dark dungeon."
"It was a dark cellar underground, built with strong stone walls, into which any criminal guilty of a capital offence was ushered to breathe his last there without food and drink. Such was the cellar into which Gangazara was thrust. What were his thoughts when he reached that place? ""It is of no use to accuse either the goldsmith or the prince now. We are all the children of fate. We must obey her commands. This is but the first day of my father's prophecy. So far his statement is true. But how am I going to pass ten years here? Perhaps without anything to sustain life I may drag on my existence for a day or two."
"But how pass ten years? That cannot be, and I must die. Before death comes let me think of my faithful brute friends."""
"So pondered Gangazara in the dark cell underground, and at that moment thought of his three friends. The tiger-king, serpent-king, and rat-king assembled at once with their armies at a garden near the dungeon, and for a while did not know what to do. They held their council, and decided to make an underground passage from the inside of a ruined well to the dungeon. The rat raja issued an order at once to that effect to his army. They, with their teeth, bored the ground a long way to the walls of the prison. After reaching it they found that their teeth could not work on the hard stones. The bandicoots were then specially ordered for the business; they, with their hard teeth, made a small slit in the wall for a rat to pass and repass without difficulty. Thus a passage was effected."
"The rat raja entered first to condole with his protector on his misfortune, and undertook to supply his protector with provisions."
"""Whatever sweetmeats or bread are prepared in any house, one and all of you must try to bring whatever you can to our benefactor. Whatever clothes you find hanging in a house, cut down, dip the pieces in water, and bring the wet bits to our benefactor. He will squeeze them and gather water for drink! and the bread and sweetmeats shall form his food."" Having issued these orders, the king of the rats took leave of Gangazara. They, in obedience to their king's order, continued to supply him with provisions and water."

"MORRIS, CAPTAIN THOMAS."
"One of the pirates of New Providence, Bahamas, who, on pardon being"
"offered by King George in 1717, escaped, and for a while carried on piracy"
in the West Indian Islands. Caught and hanged a few years afterwards.
"MORRIS, JOHN."
One of Captain Bartholomew Roberts's crew. When the _Royal Fortune_
"surrendered to H.M.S. _Swallow_, Morris fired his pistol into the"
gunpowder in the steerage and caused an explosion that killed or maimed
many of the pirates.
"MORRISON, CAPTAIN."
"A Scotch pirate, who lived on Prince Edward Island."
"For an account of his career, see Captain NELSON."
"MORRISON, WILLIAM."
Of Jamaica.
"One of Major Stede Bonnet's crew. Hanged at White Point, Charleston, South"
"Carolina, on November 8th, 1718, and buried in the marsh below low-water"
mark.
"MORTON, PHILIP."
Good to be roaming;
"Even in London, even at midnight,"
Lover-like in a lover’s gloaming.
"You the dancer and I the dreamer,"
"Children together,"
"Wandering lost in the night of London,"
In the miraculous April weather.
DURING MUSIC.
"THE music had the heat of blood,"
A passion that no words can reach;
"We sat together, and understood"
Our own heart’s speech.
"We had no need of word or sign,"
"The music spoke for us, and said"
All that her eyes could read in mine
Or mine in hers had read.
ON THE BRIDGE.
MIDNIGHT falls across hollow gulfs of
PASTEL.
THE light of our cigarettes
Went and came in the gloom:
It was dark in the little room.
"Dark, and then, in the dark,"
"Sudden, a flash, a glow,"
And a hand and a ring I know.
"And then, through the dark, a flush"
"Ruddy and vague, the grace—"
A rose—of her lyric face.
HER EYES.
BENEATH the heaven of her brows’
"Unclouded noon of peace, there lies"
A leafy heaven of hazel boughs
In the seclusion of her eyes;
Her troubling eyes that cannot rest;
And there’s a little flame that dances
(A firefly in a grassy nest)
In the green circle of her glances;
“If I can furnish you with any....”
"“Wouldn’t it be disagreeable for you to help a man who is your enemy, so"
far as ideas go?”
"“No; because I am beginning to have some curiosity too, as to whether"
"you will succeed in doing something. If I can be of any use, let me"
know.”
“I will let you know.”
"Cæsar and Kennedy took a walk about the streets, and at twilight they"
took leave of each other affectionately.
"XIV. NEW ATTEMPTS, NEW RAMBLES"
_CARDINAL SPADA_
"“I have arranged two interesting conferences for you,” said Kennedy, a"
few days later.
“My dear man!”
"“Yes; one with Cardinal Spada, the other with the Abbé Tardieu. I have"
spoken to them both about you.”
“Splendid! What kind of people are they?”
ON JUDGES’ WALK.
THAT night on Judges’ Walk the wind
Was as the voice of doom;
"The heath, a lake of darkness, lay"
As silent as the tomb.
"The vast night brooded, white with stars,"
Above the world’s unrest;
The awfulness of silence ached
Like a strong heart repressed.
"That night we walked beneath the trees,"
"Alone, beneath the trees;"
There was some word we could not say
Half uttered in the breeze.
That night on Judges’ Walk we said
No word of all we had to say;
But now there shall be no word said
Before the Judge’s Day.
IN THE NIGHT.

GALSWORTHY PLAYS--SERIES 3
By John Galsworthy
Contents:
"Under our feet as we walked in the night,"
And the shadows beneath us were stirred by the breeze
In the magical light;
"And the moon was a silver fire,"
"And the stars were flickers of flame,"
Golden and violet and red;
"And the night-wind sighed my desire,"
And the wind in the tree-tops whispered and said
In her ear her adorable name.
"But her heart would not hear what I heard,"
"The pulse of the night as it beat,"
"Love, Love, Love, the unspeakable word,"
In its murmurous repeat;
"She heard not the night-wind’s sigh,"
"Nor her own name breathed in her ear,"
"Nor the cry of my heart to her heart,"
"A speechless, a clamorous cry:"
“Love! Love! will she hear? will she hear?”
"O heart, she will hear, by and by,"
"When we part, when for ever we part."

"""Mrs. Fiorsen."""
"""Ow!""  The sound of his breathing could be heard distinctly; he twisted a"
chair round and said:
"""Take a seat, won't you?"""
Gyp shook her head.
In Mr. Wagge's face a kind of deference seemed to struggle with some more
"primitive emotion.  Taking out a large, black-edged handkerchief, he blew"
"his nose, passed it freely over his visage, and turning to his daughter,"
muttered:
"""Go upstairs."""
"The girl turned quickly, and the last glimpse of her white face whipped"
"up Gyp's rage against men.  When the door was shut, Mr. Wagge cleared his"
throat; the grating sound carried with it the suggestion of enormously
thick linings.
He said more gruffly than ever:
"""May I ask what 'as given us the honour?"""
"""I came to see your daughter."""
"His little piggy eyes travelled from her face to her feet, to the walls"
"of the room, to his own watch-chain, to his hands that had begun to rub"
"A very impressive indenture was drawn up, according to which the prisoners"
"were to become the slaves of the Company for seven years, and this was"
signed by the prisoners and by the President.
"SCOTT, WILLIAM."
One of Major Stede Bonnet's crew in the _Royal James_. Tried for piracy in
"1718 at Charleston, South Carolina, and hanged at White Point on November"
8th.
"SCUDAMORE, CHRISTOPHER."
One of Captain John Quelch's crew. Tried for piracy at the Star Tavern in
"Hanover Street, Boston, in 1704, and hanged on Charles River, Boston Side,"
"on June 30th. A report of the trial and execution of these pirates,"
"describing Scudamore's conduct on the gallows, says: ""He appeared very"
"Penitent since his Condemnation, was very diligent to improve his time"
"going to, and at the place of Execution."""
"SCUDAMORE, PETER."
Belonging to Bristol.
"Surgeon in the _Mercy_ galley, and taken by Captain Roberts in 1721. It"
was a rule on all pirate vessels for the surgeon to be excused from
"signing the ship's articles. When the next prize was taken, if she carried"

wished to leave. But when Scudamore came on board the _Royal Fortune_ he

TO A GREAT ACTRESS.
"SHE has taken my heart, though she knows not, would care not."
It thrills at her voice like a reed in the wind;
"I would taste all her agonies, have her to spare not,"
"Sin deep as she sinned,"
"To be tossed by the storm of her love, as the ocean"
"Rocks vessels to wreck; to be hers, though the cost"
Were the loss of all else: for that moment’s emotion
Content to be lost!
"To be, for a moment, the man of all men to her,"
"All the world, for one measureless moment complete;"
"To possess, be possessed! To be mockery then to her,"
Then to die at her feet!

"told Slyne on the terrace the night before concerning the Jura family,"
but without a single word of the fortune awaiting the next of kin.
Captain Dove's face expressed the extreme of astonishment as he too sat
listening with the closest attention.
"""That's as far as my present knowledge goes,"" the lawyer finished"
"blandly. ""And now--I understand that Captain Dove is prepared to supply"
the proof required in conclusion.
"""How long have you known Lady Josceline, Captain Dove?"""
"Captain Dove frowned as if in deep thought, and Slyne looked very"
crossly at him.
"""About three quarters of an hour,"" the old man answered, and, glancing"
"at Slyne, chuckled hoarsely. ""She's only been Lady Josceline for so"

Mr. Jobling nodded understanding and the creases on his fleshy forehead
disappeared again.

"""Owing to the inexcusable blunder, I'm afraid something about what it"
"contains may leak out prematurely. Those pests, the reporters, are"

"""Well, what does it contain?"" asked Kilshaw. He was annoyed at this"
"unsought publicity, but he saw at once that he must show no sign of"
vexation.
"""That, for one thing,"" and the Superintendent handed Kilshaw a"

"Rippley clasped his hands together unctuously, bowed, smiled a large"
"Italian smile. He advanced a step, and said with a strong foreign"
"accent, picking his words with slow deliberation:"
“Sir Pangboot--it has arrive to ze domestic bootler that he is
indispose sudden-ment. I am he’s friend that he have ask to take he’s
"place, vis my asseestants.... Your house shall have ze much honour in"
my hands--we have the habit to attend ze best families----”
There was a loud ringing of the door-bell.
Pangbutt put his hand over his eyes:
"“I must be going mad,” he said."
Rippley bowed:
"“Sir Pangboot--me and me friends, we speak not very well ze"
Engleesh--but we much understand it well--and----”
"“Yes, yes.” Pangbutt dismissed them impatiently. “Get to your"
business.... Curse it! I wonder what on earth ails Dukes.”
"As the four comic-looking foreign waiters left the room, he hesitated,"
"bewildered. And Rippley, as they passed out, nearly burst a bloodvessel"
as the tragic Blotte’s moustache fell off. But Pangbutt had suddenly
remembered that he was host; and advancing into the room he turned to
the others:
"“I beg your pardon, I am late I fear.”"
"Commodore Littleton, and apparently gave up his wicked ways thereafter."
"SHUTFIELD, WILLIAM."
Of Lancaster.
"Hanged at Rhode Island in July, 1723, at the age of 40."
"SICCADAM, JOHN."
Of Boston.
"One of Captain Pound's crew. Found guilty of piracy, but pardoned."
"SIMMS, HENRY, _alias_ ""GENTLEMAN HARRY."" Pickpocket, highwayman, pirate,"
and Old Etonian.
Born in 1716 at St. Martin's-in-the-Fields. Sent while quite young to
"school at Eton, where he ""shewed an early inclination to vice,"" and at the"
age of 14 was taken from school and apprenticed to a breeches-maker. No
"Old Etonian, either then or now, would stand that kind of treatment, so"
"Simms ran away, becoming a pickpocket and later a highwayman. After"
"numerous adventures and escapes from prison, he was pressed on board"
"H.M.S. _Rye_, but he deserted his ship at Leith. After an ""affair"" at"
"Croydon, Simms was transplanted with other convicts to Maryland, in the"
"_Italian Merchant_. On the voyage he attempted, but without success, to"
raise a mutiny. On his arrival in America he was sold to the master of the
"_Two Sisters_, which was taken a few days out from Maryland by a Bayonne"
"pirate. Carried to Spain, Simms got to Oporto, and there was pressed on"
"Captured in South Carolina in 1717. Tried at Charleston, and convicted of"
taking the _Turtle Dove_ and other vessels in the previous July. Hanged in
"June, 1717."
"MOODY, CAPTAIN CHRISTOPHER."
"A notorious pirate. Very active off the coast of Carolina, 1717, with two"
ships under his command. In 1722 was with Roberts on board the _Royal
"Fortune_, being one of his chief men or ""Lords."" Taken prisoner, and tried"
"at Cape Coast Castle, and hanged in chains at the age of 28."
MOORE. Gunner.
A gunner aboard Captain Kidd's ship the _Adventure_. When Kidd's mutinous
"crew were all for attacking a Dutch ship, Kidd refused to allow them to,"
"and Moore threatened the captain, who seized a bucket and struck Moore on"
"the head with it, the blow killing him. Kidd was perfectly justified in"
"killing this mutinous sailor, but eventually it was for this act that he"
was hanged in London.
"MORGAN, CAPTAIN."
"This pirate must not be confused with the buccaneer, Sir Henry Morgan."
"Little is known about him except that he was with Hamlin, the French"
"pirate, in 1683, off the coast of West Africa, and helped to take several"
Danish and English ships. Soon the pirates quarrelled over the division of
"their plunder and separated into two companies, the English following"
Captain Morgan in one of the prizes.

“Yes.”

"“I am glad, because you have such a pitiable air when you are sad. Would"
"you like to go to the Priory of Malta, which is only a step from here?”"
“Good.”
They went down in the carriage to the Priory of Malta. They knocked at
"the gate and a woman came out who knew Kennedy, and who told them to"
wait a moment and she would open the church.
"“Here,” said Kennedy, “you have all that remains of the famous Order of"
Saint John of Jerusalem. That anti-historic man Bonaparte rooted it
"out of Malta. The Order attempted to establish itself in Catania, and"
"afterwards at Ferrara, and finally took refuge here. Now it has no"
"property left, and all that remains are its memories and its archives.”"

hastened toward the camp.
“The outlaws were discussing the advisability of taking all the boys

they’ve been there and taken the lads by surprise.”
CHAPTER IX
IN QUEST OF INFORMATION
"Left at the camp by the departure of Ned and Jimmie, Jack, Frank and"
Harry sat for a long time in the warm sunshine in front of the barrier
and discussed the situation. Gilroy had tucked himself into a collection
of blankets at the rear of the cave and was sound asleep.
“What do you think Jimmie had in his mind when he went away alone?”
asked Harry. “He merely had some plan to carry out.”
"“Oh, he’s always going off alone,” Jack answered."
“Some day he’ll go away alone and won’t be able to get back!” Frank put
in. “He won’t always be able to get out of his scrapes.”
"“Pretty foxy boy, that!” Jack declared."
"“What strikes me as being singular,” Frank suggested, “is that Jack’s"
father never said a word to him about this land business.”
"""Well?"" she interrogated."
"""Well, we was sure that you was in trouble,"" put in Sonora. ""My breath"
"jest stopped."""
"""Me? Me in trouble, Sonora?"" A little laugh that was half-gay,"
"half-derisive, accompanied her words."
"""See here, that man Ramerrez--"" followed up Rance with a grim look."
"""--feller you was dancin' with,"" interposed Sonora, but checked himself"
instantly lest he wound the Girl's feelings.
"Whereupon, Rance, with no such compunctions, became the spokesman, a"
grimace of pleasure spreading over his countenance as he thought of the
unpleasant surprise he was about to impart. Stretching out his stiffened
"fingers over the blaze, he said in his most brutal tones:"
"""Your polkying friend is none other than Ramerrez."""
"The Girl's eyes opened wide, but they did not look at the Sheriff. They"
looked straight before her.
"""I warned you, girl,"" spoke up Ashby, ""that you should bank with us"
"oftener."""
The Girl gave no sign of having heard him. Her slender figure seemed to
"have shrunken perceptibly as she stared stupidly, uncomprehendingly,"
into space.
"""We say that Johnson was--"" repeated Rance, impatiently."
"Asiatic countries. We are said to be the successors of the Tartars, at"
one time the disturbers of the world's peace. Nothing of the kind.
Russia would be more fittingly the successor of the Tartars. The Tartar
races have been merged in the Russian Empire.
"'I am sure,' added Baron Suyematsu, in a final word, 'that Europe will"
"soon find its fears about the ""spectre of Japan"" are all ill-founded."
"England, I am glad to believe, never had those fears, and before long I"
hope to see her colonies in the same frame of mind. I hope the
Commonwealth Parliament will lead the way.'

THE ANGLO-JAPANESE ALLIANCE AND AMERICA[1]
AN INTERVIEW
"'Our people,' said Baron Suyematsu, 'like the British people, favour"
the renewal of the Anglo-Japanese alliance. They also favour its
"extension. The nature of such extension demands careful thought, of"
"course. I will not go into details, but I will say that a more effectual"
"alliance is desirable from the standpoints of both England and Japan,"
and I also think from the standpoint of America. Japan's interest is too
"obvious to require mention; but England's interest, in my opinion, is"
equally real. Russia and England are in contact throughout Asia and
friction is constant. England needs strengthening against Russia and
the better for it.
"83,672. He could not understand why men went to Japan and Canada instead"
of coming to India on better terms. It was a mystery to him. He thought
it was either sheer ignorance or the spread of the commercial spirit.
"83,673. All the students coming to his side of the University, were, as"
"a rule, keen and anxious to learn; he could not wish for better"
students.
"83,674. (Mr. Gupta). He desired one service, because he thought it was"
"most degrading that certain men, although they were doing the same work,"
"should be classed in a Provincial Service, while others should be"
classed in an Imperial Service. The prospect of the members of the
"Provincial Service were not at all what they ought to be, and that was"
the reason why the best men were not attracted to it.
PROF. J. C. BOSE AT MADURA
On his way back to Calcutta from the Fourth Scientific Deputation to the
"West, Prof. J. C. Bose visited Madura, 14th June 1915. The Tamil Sangam"
presented him with an address. In reply Dr. Bose made an important
"speech, in course of which he said:--"
I am no longer a representative of Bengal nor have I come to a strange
"place, but as an Indian addressing the mighty India and her people. When"
we realise that unity of our destiny then a great future opens out for
us.

_The Red Spot_
"[Sidenote: What is the mystery centered in Jupiter's famous ""Red"
"Spot""? Two fighting Earthmen, caught by the ""Pipe-men"" like their"
"vanished comrades, soon find out.]"
"Commander Stone, grizzled chief of the Planetary Exploration Forces,"
acknowledged Captain Brand Bowen's salute and beckoned him to take a
seat.
"Brand, youngest officer of the division to wear the triple-V for"
"distinguished service, sat down and stared curiously at his superior."
He hadn't the remotest idea why he had been recalled from leave: but
that it was on a matter of some importance he was sure. He hunched his
big shoulders and awaited orders.
"""Captain Bowen,"" said Stone. ""I want you to go to Jupiter as soon as"
"you can arrange to do so, fly low over the red area in the southern"
"hemisphere, and come back here with some sort of report as to what's"
"wrong with that infernal death spot."""
He tapped his radio stylus thoughtfully against the edge of his desk.
"""As you perhaps know, I detailed a ship to explore the red spot about"
"a year ago. It never came back. I sent another ship, with two good men"

3. Hymns of the Eastern Church: Greek and Syriac.
"The ancient Eastern Church developed a rich hymnody, rising steadily in"
the fourth century until it reached its culmination in the eighth and
"ninth centuries. Since it employed the Greek and Syriac languages, its"
hymnic treasures remained almost completely hidden and unknown to the
English speaking churches for many centuries. It is only in recent
"years, through the efforts of scholars like John Mason Neale and Edward"
Caswall that some of the Eastern hymns have been translated and made
available for modern use. Eastern hymns are characterized by an
"objective, dignified, contemplation of God. Except when confessing sin"
"and unworthiness, they contain nothing of the subjective feelings of the"
worshipper such as is found in many modern hymns. Though there is very
"little in the _Hymnary_ from the Eastern Church, our collection is"
enriched by the inclusion of a small number of hymns from this source.

"Whereupon Rollo addressed himself to the others, setting clearly before"
them the gravity of the situation.
John Mortimer shook his head gravely. He could not approve.
"""How often has my father told me that the first loss is the least! This"
all comes of trying to make up my disappointment about the Abbot's
"Priorato!"""
Etienne shrugged his shoulders and philosophically quoted a Gascon
proverb to the effect that who buys the flock must take the black sheep
also.
El Sarria simply recollected that his gun and pistols were in good
"order, and waited for orders."
The conference therefore resolved itself into a trio of
"consultants--Rollo because he was the leader, Sergeant Cardono because"
"he knew the country, and Concha--because she was Concha!"
They were within an hour or two's rapid march of La Granja over a pass
in the Guadarrama. The sergeant volunteered to lead them down into the
gardens in that time. He knew a path often travelled by smugglers on
their way to Segovia.
"""It is clear that if we are to carry away the Queen-Regent and her"
"daughter, we must forestall the gipsies,"" said Rollo."
Concha clasped her hands pitifully.
"""Ah, the poor young Queen!"" she cried. ""Praise to the saints that I was"
Two or three days later Cæsar met the Spaniard Cortés in the Piazza
"Colonna. They bowed. The thin, sour-looking painter was walking with a"
"beardless young German, red and snub-nosed. This young man was a painter"
"too, Cortés said; he wore a green hat with a cock’s feather, a blue"
"cape, thick eyeglasses, big boots, and had a certain air of being a"
blond Chinaman.
“Would you like to come to the Doria gallery with us?” asked Cortés.
“What is there to see there?”
“A stupendous portrait by Velázquez.”
“I warn you that I know nothing about pictures.”
"“Nobody does,” Cortés declared roundly. “Everybody says what he thinks.”"
“Is the gallery near here?”
"“Yes, just a step.”"
In company with Cortés and the German with the green hat with the cock’s
"feather, Cæsar went to the Piazza del Collegio Romano, where the Doria"
palace is. They saw a lot of pictures which didn’t seem any better to
"Cæsar than those in the antique shops and the pawnbrokers’, but which"
drew learned commentaries from the German. Then Cortés took them to a
cabinet hung in green and lighted by a skylight. There was nothing to
be seen in the cabinet except the portrait of the Pope. In order that
"people might look at it comfortably, a sofa had been installed facing"
it.

"“My wife has a deadly hatred for all of them,” said Giovanni Battista,"
laughing.
“And why so?” asked Cæsar.
“Because we talk politics and sometimes they ask me for a few
pennies....”
"“Your wife must have a lively temper,...” said Cæsar."
"“Yes, an unhappy disposition; good, awfully good; but very"
superstitious. Christianity has produced nothing but superstitions.”
"“Giovanni Battista is a pagan, as his wife well says,” asserted Kennedy."
“What superstitions has your wife?” asked Cæsar.
“All of them. Romans are very superstitious and my wife is a Roman. If
"you see a hunchback, it is good luck; if you see three, then your luck"
is magnificent and you have to swallow your saliva three times; on the
"other hand, if you see a humpbacked woman it is a bad omen and you must"
spit on the ground to keep away the _jettatura_. Three priests together
"is a very good sign. We ought all to get along very well in Rome,"
because we see three and up to thirty priests together.”
"“A spider is also very significant,” said Kennedy; “in the morning it is"
"of bad augury, and in the evening good.”"
“And at noon?” asked Cæsar.
"“At noon,” answered Lanza, laughing, “it means nothing to speak of. But"
"ship, the _Santa Maria Desaie_, from Tenby to Bastabill Haven. Off the"
Welsh coast the ship was attacked by a pirate vessel called the
"_Furtuskewys_, with a crew of thirty-five pirates. Alves was put ashore on"
"the Welsh coast, and the two ships then sailed to Cork, where the ship and"
"her cargo were sold to the mayor for 1,524 crowns."
"Alves complained to the King of England, and orders were sent to the Mayor"
"of Cork, Richard Gowllys, to give up the ship, which he refused to do, but"
by way of excusing his actions he explained that he thought the ship was a
Scotch one and not a Portuguese.
"PHILLIPS, CAPTAIN."
"In 1723 this noted pirate took a sloop, the _Dolphin_, of Cape Ann, on the"
Banks of Newfoundland. The crew of the _Dolphin_ were compelled by
"Phillips to join the pirates. Amongst the prisoners was a fisherman, John"
"Fillmore. Finding no opportunity to escape, Fillmore with another sailor,"
"Edward Cheesman, and an Indian, suddenly seized and killed Phillips and"
"the two other chief pirates. The rest of the crew agreeing, the ship was"
taken to Boston.
"PHILIPS, JAMES."
Of the Island of Antigua.
"Formerly of the _Revenge_, and afterwards in the _Royal Fortune_ (Captain"
Roberts). When the _Royal Fortune_ surrendered in 1722 to H.M.S.

"prevented by the master, Glasby. Hanged at the age of 35."

"""Well, I tho't I seen him,"" evaded Nick with considerable uneasiness. ""I"
"couldn't swear to it. You see it was dark, an'--Moses but the Sidney"
"Duck's a liar!"""
"At length, Ashby decided that the man had in all probability been snowed"
"under, ending confidently with:"
"""Something scared him off and he lit out without his horse."" Which"
"remark brought temporary relief to the Girl, for Nick, watching her, saw"
the colour return to her face.
"Unconsciously, during this discussion, the Girl had risen to her feet,"
"but only to fall back in her chair again almost as suddenly, a sign of"
nervousness which did not escape the sharp eye of the Sheriff.
"""How do you know the man's a road agent?"" A shade almost of contempt was"
in the Girl's question.
Sonora breathed on his badly nipped fingers before answering:
"""Well, two greasers jest now were pretty positive before they quit."""
Instantly the Girl's head went up in the air.
"""Greasers!"" she ejaculated scornfully, while her eyes unfalteringly met"
Rance's steady gaze.
"""But the woman knew him,"" was the Sheriff's vindictive thrust."
The Girl started; her face went white.
“Do you go in for modern epigraphy?” asked Kennedy.
"“Yes. It is one of the things I take pleasure in reading, in the towns"
I go to; the advertisements in the newspapers and the writings on the
wall.”
“It’s a good kind of curiosity.”
"“Yes, I believe one learns more about the real life in a town from such"
inscriptions than from the guide- and text-books.”
“That’s possible. And what conclusions have you drawn from your
observations?”
“They are not of much value. I haven’t constructed a science of
"wall-inscriptions, as that fake Lambroso would have done.”"
"“But you will construct it surely, when you have lighted on the"
underlying system.”
“You think my epigraphical science is on the same level as my financial
science. What a mistake!”
“All right. But tell me what you have discovered about different towns.”
"“London, for instance, I have found, is childish in its inscriptions and"
somewhat clownish. When some sentimental foolishness doesn’t occur to a
"Londoner of the people, some brutality or rough joke occurs to him.”"
"“You are very kind,” said Kennedy, laughing."
"“Paris has a vulgar, cruel taste; in the Frenchman of the people you"
he speaks with La Giralda in a tongue which neither I nor Don Rollo
"understand."""
"""But I thought,"" said El Sarria, astonished for the first time, ""that"
both you and Don Rollo understood the crabbed gipsy tongue! Have I not
"heard you speak it together?"""
"""As it is commonly spoken--yes,"" she replied, ""we have talked many a"
time for sport. But this which is spoken by the Sergeant and La Giralda
"is deep Romany, the like of which not half a dozen in Spain understand."

"the jargon of fairs and the slang of the travelling horse-clipper."""
"""Then,"" said El Sarria, slowly, ""it comes to this--'tis you and not I"
"who mistrust these two?"""
"""No, that I do not,"" cried Concha, emphatically; ""I have tried La"
"Giralda for many years and at all times found her faithful, so that her"
bread be well buttered and a draught of good wine placed alongside it.
"But the Sergeant is a strong man and a secret man----"""
"""Well worth the watching, then?"" said El Sarria, looking her full in the"
face.
Concha nodded.
"""Carlist or no, he works for his own hand,"" she said simply."
"""Shall ye mention the matter to Don Rollo?"" asked El Sarria."
"""Nay--what good?"" said Concha, quickly; ""Don Rollo is brave as a bull of"

take pleasure in restoring your rings.”
"She took from her handkerchief a beautiful little casket of blue onyx,"
"upon which reposed the Pendleton crest in diamonds, touched a spring,"
and revealed four rings sparkling about as many velvet cushions. The
four men stood speechless; not one dared protest his sincerity and see
ridicule in the eyes of his neighbour.
"Mrs. Pendleton dropped her judicial air, and taking the ruby between her"
"fingers, smiled like a teacher bestowing a prize."
"“Mr. Boswell,” she said, “I believe this belongs to you;” and she handed"
the ring to the stupefied author. He put it in his pocket with never a
word.
"She raised the emerald. “Mr. Trent, this is yours?—or is it the"
sapphire?”
"[Illustration: “‘WELL, WHY DON’T YOU GO?’”]"
"“The emerald,” snorted Trent."
"She dropped it in his nerveless palm with a gracious bend of the head,"
and turned to Teddy.
"“You gave me a solitaire, I remember,” she said sweetly. “A most"
"appropriate gift, for it is the ideal life.”"
"Teddy looked as if about to burst into tears, gave her one beseeching"
"glance, then took his ring and strode feebly over the cliffs. Trent and"
"Boswell hesitated a moment, then hurried after."

"to help you, I beg that you will call on me.”"
"“I shall not forget,” he answered, relinquishing the hand reluctantly."
"Then, as she thanked him, and turned again to her guest, he added in a"
"low tone to me, “A remarkable girl, Walter, a girl that can be depended"
on.”
We followed Miss Sears down the hall.
"“Who was that young man in the music room?” asked Kennedy, when we were"
out of earshot.
"“Duncan Baldwin,” she answered. “A friend and bosom companion of"
Reginald.”
"“He seems to think more of Betty than of her brother,” Craig remarked"
dryly.
"Miss Sears smiled. “Sometimes, we think they are secretly engaged,” she"
"returned. We had almost reached the door. “By the way,” she asked"
"anxiously, “do you think there are any precautions that I should take"
for Mrs. Blake—and the rest?”
"“Hardly,” answered Kennedy, after a moment’s consideration, “as long as"
"you have taken none in particular already. Still, I suppose it will do"
no harm to be as antiseptic as possible.”
"“I shall try,” she promised, her face showing that she considered the"
affair now in a much more serious light than she had before our visit.
"“And keep me informed of anything that turns up,” added Kennedy handing"

It could not have been more than twenty minutes later when Mrs. Moulton
"emerged rather hurriedly, and drove away."
While we had been waiting I had observed a man on the other side of the
"street who seemed unduly interested in the Recherche, too, for he had"
"walked up and down the block no less than six times. Kennedy saw him,"
"and as he made no effort to follow Mrs. Moulton, Kennedy did not do so"
either. In fact a little quick glance which she had given at our cab
had raised a fear that she might have discovered that she was being
followed.
Kennedy and I paid off our cabman and sauntered into the Recherche in
the most debonair manner we could assume.
"“Now, son, we’ll go up,” he said to the boy who, remembering us, and"
now not at all clear in his mind that he might not have seen us before
"that, whisked us to the tenth floor."
"“Let me see,” said Kennedy, “it’s number one hundred and—er——”"
"“Three,” prompted the boy."
He pressed the buzzer and a neatly dressed colored maid responded.
"“I had an appointment here with Mrs. Moulton this morning,” remarked"
Kennedy.
"“She has just gone,” replied the maid, off her guard."
"“And was to meet Mr. Schloss here in half an hour,” he added quickly."
"eyes without spectacles, I recognized George Hamilton, and almost choked"
myself in smothering a cry.
"Frances turned to me, asking indignantly, ""Why did not you tell me?"""
"""Because I did not know,"" I answered, hardly able to believe the truth."
"But we had important business before us, and I knew that we should"
"prepare for it before Lilly came in. So George, Bettina, Frances, and"
I went to a window at the far end of the room to hold a consultation.
"""Since I did not recognize you, perhaps Lilly will not,"" I suggested. ""I"
"trust the Doctor, but perhaps we had better leave him under the"
impression that you are Monsieur l'Abbé du Boise and give no intimation
"of the truth."""
"""I had not hoped that my disguise would deceive you, Baron Ned,"" said"
"George, ""but since it has, it is just as well that we leave Lilly in the"
"dark if we can."""
"""But he will know. The stars will tell him,"" suggested Bettina, opening"
her eyes very wide.
"""The stars will tell him what he is paid to hear,"" I remarked. Then"
"turning to Frances, I asked, ""How is it that you were able to recognize"
"him?"""
"""By his eyes!"" exclaimed Frances and Bettina in concert."
"""That gives me a valuable hint,"" said George, hastily adjusting his"
"colored spectacles. ""Now, how about it?"""
"shall have some of the money,"" said the merchant to himself, ""but not"
"all of it. For he has to thank me for the cat, which I bought for him,"
"and charity begins at home."""
"But while the merchant was thinking these thoughts, such a storm and"
tempest arose that all thought the ship would sink. Then the merchant
realized that there was nothing left for him to do but to promise that
"the boy should have all the money. No sooner had he made his vow, than"
"the weather turned fair, and he had a favoring wind for his journey"
"home. And when he landed, he gave the youth the six hundred dollars and"
his daughter to boot. For now the scullion was as rich as the merchant
"himself and richer, and thereafter he lived in splendor and happiness."
"And he took in his mother and treated her kindly. ""For I do not believe"
"that charity begins at home,"" said the youth."

THE MAGIC APPLES
Once upon a time there was a lad who was better off than all the others.
"“About two miles on the level,” Frank suggested, “and about four hundred"
miles the way the surface of the ground runs.”
"After a short rest the boys proceeded south, climbing over jutting"
"spurs, dipping into depressions, and sliding over stony slopes until"
they were almost too tired to take another step.
"“We’ll get used to this in a month or two,” Harry said, sitting plump"
down on a boulder.
"Frank followed the boy’s example, except that he stretched himself at"
"full length, while Jack pushed on a few steps and stood peering over a"
rim of rock which lay directly in their way.
"“Look here, boys!” Jack finally called. “You remember the place in"
"Mexico called the Devil’s Cauldron? Well, this is it!”"
“What have you found now?” demanded Frank sleepily.
"“Here’s a round hole in the mountain,” Jack answered back, “that you"
might hide a city block in. It’s deep and the sides are almost smooth.
"Looks like the pit Kipling gets one of his characters in, only there’s"
rock instead of sand.”
The boys rose to their feet and looked over the ledge.
"“And right there in the bottom,” Harry exclaimed, “is a pool of water so"
clear that it looks like a diamond!”
"“Running water, too,” added Frank. “Now, where do you think that water"
"comes from, and where does it go to?”"
man at my time of life! Do you realize that I am twice her age?”
"And he went on, inveighing now against the pitifully human conventions"
"that restrained him from hurting the chit of a child, and now against"
the sorcery with which she contrived to invest the chamber wherein she
dwelt.
"“And at my age, too, when I 've run the whole gamut of human misery,"
the whole discordant thing--_toute la lyre_--when I've finished with the
"blighting illusion that men call life; when, confound it! I 'm thirty.”"
"Sir Oliver, unable to sleep, came into the room in dressing-gown and"
slippers. He looked very fragile and broken.
"“Here 's John,” laughed Herold, “saying that he 's thirty, and an old,"
"withered man, and he 's not thirty. He 's nine-and-twenty.”"
"Sir Oliver looked at John, as only age, with awful wistfulness, can"
"look at youth, and came and laid his hand upon the young man's broad"
shoulders.
"“My lad,” said he, “you've had a bad time; but you 're young. You've"
"the whole of your life before you. Time, my dear boy, is a marvellous"
"solvent of human perplexity. Once in a new world, once in that"
astonishing continent of Australia--”
John threw a half-finished cigar angrily into the fire.
"“I'm not going to the damned continent,” said he."
"""Do you understand Accum?"""
"""I stopped shortly before Matrix. Accumulative Math is so much pothooks"
"on a sheet of paper to me."""
"""Um. Then I'd find it hard to explain. The theory seems to be"
"demonstrable, and the accumulative mathematics upholds the"
experimental evidence. But there hasn't yet been an acceptable verbal
"description of what happens."""
"""I've often wondered, leaving the nondirectional quality out of it,"
why we couldn't cut our emitting power and somehow compute range by
"observing the incoming power from a distant infrawave transmitter."""
"Allison shook his head. ""Oddly enough, the matrix mathematics that"
deal with radiation shows that for any hypothetical radiation with an
"infinite velocity of propagation, there can be no attenuation with"
"distance."""
"""Meaning that we should be able to transmit all the way from here to"
"hell and back."""
"""Not exactly. Infrawave radiation comes in quanta, you know. A kilowatt"
"covers two point one, seven nine three six plus parsecs. Two kilowatts"
"covers twice that distance minus the ninth root of two point, seven"
nine three six plus. Three kilowatts covers three times two point et
"cetera, minus two times the ninth root."" Allison shrugged and spread"
his hands.
*       *       *       *       *
chuckled ecstatically. His own eyes were shining.
"""That settles it, Lady Josceline,"" said he triumphantly, turning to"
"Sallie. ""I'll stake my professional reputation on your identity now. You"
"need have no further doubt--"""
"""And just to clinch the matter,"" growled Captain Dove, ""you'd better add"
this to your affidavy:--The clothes the kid was wearing when I fetched
her off that dhow were all marked with the moniker 'J. J.' and some sort
of crest. But--they were all lost when the ship I commanded then
"was--went down at sea."""
"Mr. Jobling groaned. ""How _very_ unfortunate!"" he remarked before he"
resumed his writing. And Slyne stared fixedly at the old man until the
lawyer had finished.
"""Now,"" said Mr. Jobling, adjusting his pince-nez and beaming about him"
"again, ""we can call in a couple of witnesses and--"""
"""We'll witness each other's signatures."" Slyne disagreed. ""Better not"
"bring in any outsiders."""
"The stout solicitor frowned over that, but finally nodded concurrence."
"And Captain Dove took the pen from him, only to hand it to Slyne."
"""Gimme my thousand dollars and your joint note for the balance first,"""
he requested unamiably.
"Slyne signed the new note Mr. Jobling pushed across the table, and Mr."
Jobling endorsed it. Captain Dove read it over carefully before he
"pocketed it, and also counted with great caution the bills Slyne tossed"
"to him. Then he in his turn signed, without reading it, the statement"
"So, with greatly altered circumstance, was it in the present instance."
Rollo kissed first and made up his mind to it some time after.
Consequently Concha was taken absolutely by surprise. She uttered a
little cry and stepped back indignantly into the lighted room where the
spare muskets were piled.
"But again Rollo was before her. If he had attempted to make love, she"
"would have scathed him with the soundest indignation, based on"
"considerations of time, place, and personality."
But the young Scot gave her no opportunity. In a moment he had again
become her superior officer.
"""Take your piece,"" he said, with an air of assured command, ""together"
"with sufficient ammunition, and post yourself at the little staircase"
window over the great door looking towards the town. If you see any one
"approaching, do not hesitate to fire. Good-bye. God bless you! I will"
"see you again on my rounds!"""
And Rollo passed on his way.
"Then with a curious constraint upon her tongue, and on her spirit a new"
and delightful feeling that she could do no other than as she was
"bidden, Concha found herself, with loaded musket and pistol, obediently"
taking her place in the general defence of the palace.
CHAPTER XXXII
"allow her,--and great gladness lit her face."
“Darling! Are you going to stay here to-day and to-morrow and the next
day?”
"“My dear,” said John, “I've got to get up to town this morning.”"
"“You won't do that,” said Stella. “Look at the clock.”"
"It was a quarter to one. He had spent the whole morning with her, and"
the hours had flown by like minutes.
“Why did n't you tell me that I ought to be catching my train?”
She regarded him in demure mischief.
“I had no object in making you catch your train.”
"And then Her Serene High-and-Mightiness, the nurse (who had been called"
"in for Stella when first she was put to bed in the sea-chamber, and,"
"falling under her spell, had stayed on until she had grown as much"
involved in the web of her life as Sir Oliver and Lady Julia and
"Constable and Herold and Risca), came into the room and decreed the end"
of the morning interview.
"Risca went down-stairs, his purpose unaccomplished. He walked about the"
"garden and argued with himself. Now, when a man argues with himself, he,"
"being only the extraneous eidolon of himself, invariably gets the worst"
"of the argument, and this makes him angry. John was angry; to such a"
"point that, coming across Sir Oliver, who had just returned from an"
inexplicably disastrous game of golf and began to pour a story of
"bunkered gloom into his ear, he gnashed his teeth and tore his hair and"
"the greater number of her clothes, hers was the heavier sack. Thus had"
they shifted their burdens; what burdens would they carry in the future?
"She was, after all, no longer a schoolmistress, and perhaps he was no"
longer with the theater or the films.
"I watched those two crossing rocky, mountainous ground, bare ground, with"
not a tree anywhere except a few stunted junipers; far away near the ridge
"murmured the little Reisa. Those two had put their possessions together,"
"were walking together; at the next halt they would be man and wife, and"
take only one room because it was cheaper.
"Suddenly I started up and, moved by some impulse of human sympathy--nay,"
"of duty--I wanted to run across to her, talk to her, say a word of"
"warning: ""Don't go on!"" I could have done it in a few minutes--a good"
"deed, a duty...."
They disappeared behind the shoulder of the hill.
Her name was Ingeborg.
XXVI
"And now I, too, must wander on again, for I am the last at the Tore Peak"
"farm. The season is wearing on, and this morning it snowed for the first"
"time--wet, sad snow."
"It is very quiet at the farm now, and Josephine might have played the"
"piano again and been friendly to the last guest; but now I am leaving,"
"calculations, took no notice of the dark group of men, who were taking"
such a wicked delight in adding to his father's discomfiture.  He did
not even once look in their direction.
"""The young spider has himself well in hand,"" remarked Abyedok, watching"
young Petunikoff's every movement and action.  Having taken all the
"measurements he desired, Ivan Andreyevitch knit his brows, got into the"
"cart, and drove away.  His son went with a firm step into Vaviloff's"
"eating-house, and disappeared behind the door."
"""Ho, ho!  That's a determined young thief! ...  What will happen next,"
"I wonder ...?"" asked Kuvalda."
"""Next?  Young Petunikoff will buy out Egor Vaviloff,"" said Abyedok with"
"conviction, and smacked his lips as if the idea gave him great pleasure."
"""And you are glad of that?"" Kuvalda asked him, gravely."
"""I am always pleased to see human calculations miscarry,"" explained"
"Abyedok, rolling his eyes and rubbing his hands with delight.  The"
Captain spat angrily on the ground and was silent. They all stood in
"front of the tumble-down building, and silently watched the doors of"
the eating-house.  More than an hour passed thus.  Then the doors
opened and Petunikoff came out as silently as he had entered.  He
"stopped for a moment, coughed, turned up the collar of his coat,"
"glanced at the men, who were following all his movements with their"
"eyes, and then went up the street towards the town."
"The Captain watched him for a moment, and turning to Abyedok said,"
smilingly:
"""Probably you were right after all, you son of a scorpion and a"
of an American vessel some time previously.
"DE SOTO, CAPTAIN BENITO."
A Portuguese.
A most notorious pirate in and about 1830.
"In 1827 he shipped at Buenos Ayres as mate in a slaver, named the"
"_Defenser de Pedro_, and plotted to seize the ship off the African coast."
"The pirates took the cargo of slaves to the West Indies, where they sold"
"them. De Soto plundered many vessels in the Caribbean Sea, then sailed to"
"the South Atlantic, naming his ship the _Black Joke_. The fear of the"
_Black Joke_ became so great amongst the East Indiamen homeward bound that
they used to make up convoys at St. Helena before heading north.
"In 1832 de Soto attacked the _Morning Star_, an East Indiaman, and took"
"her, when he plundered the ship and murdered the captain. After taking"
"several more ships, de Soto lost his own on the rocky coast of Spain, near"
"Cadiz. His crew, although pretending to be honest shipwrecked sailors,"
"were arrested, but de Soto managed to escape to Gibraltar. Here he was"
recognized by a soldier who had seen de Soto when he took the _Morning
"Star_, in which he had been a passenger. The pirate was arrested, and"
"tried before Sir George Don, the Governor of Gibraltar, and sentenced to"
death. He was sent to Cadiz to be hanged with the rest of his crew. The
"gallows was erected at the water's edge, and de Soto, with his coffin, was"
"conveyed there in a cart. He died bravely, arranging the noose around his"
"own neck, stepping up into his coffin to do so; then, crying out, ""Adios"
"todos,"" he threw himself off the cart."
"This man must not be confused with one Bernado de Soto, who was tried for"
"bowed deferentially. ""You are about to receive a great honor. The CEO"
"has asked for a private conference with you."""
Yuri stared over Ikeda's shoulder at the Man-in-Charge. All this right-
wing brass standing around kissing his ass counted for nothing. He was
the one calling the shots. Who was everybody kidding?
"Now the CEO looked his way, sizing him up with a quick glance. Yuri"
"Androv assessed him in turn. It was one look, but they both knew there"
was trouble ahead.
Then Tanzan Mino patted a colonel-general on the shoulder and headed
"over. ""Yuri Andreevich Androv, I presume,"" he said in flawless Russian,"
"bowing lightly. ""A genuine pleasure to meet you at last. There's a most"
"urgent matter we have to discuss."""
Thursday 4:00 P.M.
"At the precise hour, the _tokonoma _alcove off Vance's bedroom rotated"
"ninety degrees, as though moved by an unseen hand, and what awaited"
"beyond was a traditional Japanese sand-and-stone garden. It was, of"
"course, lit artificially, but the clusters of green shrubs seemed to be"
thriving on the fluorescents. Through the garden's grassy center was a
curving pathway of flat stepping stones placed artfully in irregular
"curves, and situated on either side of the walkway were towering rocks"
nestled in glistening sand that had been raked to represent ocean
waves. The rocks were reminiscent of the soaring mountains in Chinese
Sung landscape paintings.
"But Johnson was not in a laughing mood. Indeed, he looked very grave and"
serious when presently he said:
"""But people coming up here and finding me might--"""
The Girl looked up at him in blank amazement.
"""Might what?"" And then, while she waited for his answer, two shots in"
close succession rang out in the night with great distinctness.
There was no mistaking the nearness of the sound. Instantly scenting
"trouble and alert at the possibility of danger, Johnson inquired:"
"""What's that? What's that?"""
"""Wait! Wait!"" came back from the Girl, unconsciously in the same tone,"
while she strained her ears for other sounds. She did not have long to
"wait, however, before other shots followed, the last ones coming from"
"further away, so it seemed, and at greater intervals."
"""They've got a road agent--it's the posse--p'r'aps they've got Ramerrez"
"or one o' his band!"" suddenly declared the Girl, at the same time"
"rushing over to the window for some verification of her words. But, as"
"before, the wind was beating with great force against the frosted panes,"
and only a vast stretch of snow met her gaze. Turning away from the
"window she now came towards him with: ""You see, whoever it is, they're"
"snowed in--they can't get away."""
Johnson knitted his brows and muttered something under his breath which
the Girl did not catch.
Again a shot was fired.
behind.
These saddle bags are most fascinating. They are coarsely woven in bands
"of raw black-rusty wool, with varying bands of raw white wool or hemp or"
cotton--the bands and stripes of varying widths going cross-wise. And on
"the pale bands are woven sometimes flowers in most lovely colours,"
"rose-red and blue and green, peasant patterns--and sometimes fantastic"
"animals, beasts, in dark wool again. So that these striped zebra bags,"
"some wonderful gay with flowery colours on their stripes, some weird"
"with fantastic, griffin-like animals, are a whole landscape in"
themselves.
The train has only first and third class. It costs about thirty francs
"for the two of us, third class to Mandas, which is some sixty miles. In"
"we crowd with the joyful saddle-bags, into the wooden carriage with its"
many seats.
"And, wonder of wonders, punctually to the second, off we go, out of"
Cagliari. En route again.

MANDAS.
"The coach was fairly full of people, returning from market. On these"
railways the third class coaches are not divided into compartments. They
"are left open, so that one sees everybody, as down a room. The"
"attractive saddle-bags, _bercole_, were disposed anywhere, and the bulk"
"wiping it. All the while his eyes were emotionless, betraying no hint"
of what was in his mind.
"After the utensils were ceremonially cleansed, he wordlessly scooped a"
"portion of pale-green powdered tea into the bowl, then lifted a"
dipperful of boiling water from the kettle and poured it in. Finally he
"picked up a bamboo whisk and began to whip the mixture, continuing"
until it had acquired the consistency of green foam.
"Authority, control, and--above all--discipline. Those things, Vance knew,"
"were what this was really about. As was traditional and proper, not a"
"word was spoken. This was the Zen equivalent of High Mass, and Tanzan"
"Mino was silently letting him know he was a true master--of himself, of"
his world.
"Then the _oyabun _reached over and formally presented the bowl, placing"
it on the _tatami  _in front of his guest.
"Vance lifted it up, rotated it a half turn in his hand, and took a"
"reserved sip. As the bitter beverage assaulted his mouth, he found"
himself thinking this was probably intended to be his Last Supper. He
hoped he remembered enough to get the moves right.
"He sipped one more time, then wiped the rim, formally repositioned the"
"bowl on the _tatami_, and leaned back."
"""Perfectly done,"" Tanzan Mino smiled as he broke the silence. ""I'm"
"impressed."" He nodded toward the white bowl. ""Incidentally, you were"
"just handling one of the finest pieces in all Japan."""
"""Shino ware. Mino region, late sixteenth century. Remarkably fine"
"glaze, considering those kilns had just started firing _chawan_."""
"know--all strangers, save one.  This was a cabinet portrait in a heavy"
"silver frame, and as I took it up to scrutinise it more closely a cry"
involuntarily escaped my lips.
The picture was a three-quarter length representation of a
"black-bearded, keen-eyed man, standing with his hands thrust idly in his"
"pockets, and smoking a cigarette.  There was no mistaking those"
features.  It was the photograph of the man the discovery of whose
presence in Paris had produced such an extraordinary effect upon her--
Rodolphe Wolf.
CHAPTER SEVEN.
BY A THREAD.
"I was still standing by the window, holding the photograph in my hand,"
"and gazing upon it in wonder, when Dick Deane was shown in."
"""What's the matter, old chap?  Are you the man in possession here?"" he"
"asked breezily, gripping me by the hand."
"He was a fair, merry-faced fellow of thirty-five, rather good-looking,"
"smartly dressed in black frock-coat of professional cut, and wearing a"
"pair of gold-rimmed pince-nez.  He had been born in Paris, and had spent"
"the greater part of his life there, except during the years when he was"
"at school with me before going to Edinburgh, where he took his degree."
"Then he had returned to Paris, taken his French degree, and had soon"
risen to be one of the fashionable doctors in the French capital.  He
"was an especial favourite in the salons, and, like every good-looking"
"doctor, a favourite with the ladies."
"""I'm not in possession,"" I answered.  ""A very serious affair has"
"""The murder!"" exclaimed the Captain."
"""Don't talk to me about it, Perry,"" the Chief Justice requested, opening"
"a paper in front of his face. He did not, however, withdraw out of"
earshot.
"""They've got a sort of a clue. A wretched hobbledehoy of a fellow,"
"something in the bookseller's shop at the corner of Kettle Street, has"
come with a rigmarole about a society that he and a few more belonged
"to, including this François Gaspard, who is missing. He protests that"
"the thing was legal, and all that--only a Radical inner ring--but he"
says that at the last meeting this fellow was dropping hints about
putting somebody out of the way. Dyer--that's the lad's name--swears the
"rest of them disowned him and said they'd have nothing to do with it,"
"and hoped he'd given up the idea."""
"""I suppose he's in a blue funk?"" asked the Captain."
"""He is no doubt alarmed,"" said Sir Robert. ""He gave the police the names"
"of the rest of their precious society, and, oddly enough, Ned Evans, of"
"the House--you know him, Coxon?--was one."""
"""Heard such an awful lot of debates, poor chap,"" observed Captain"
Heseltine.
"""Well, they went to Evans' and collared him. For a time he stuck out"
"that he knew nothing about it, but they threatened him with heaven knows"
"what, and at last he confessed to having seen this Gaspard in company"
with the murdered man in Digby Square a little before twelve on the
"night."""
"""By Jove! That's awkward!"" said the Captain."
I'm glad you did. I suppose the lampooners will get hold of the story
and will set every one laughing at me. Kidnapped the wrong woman and
lost her! Odds fish! But you're a pair of wise ones. I see I shall have
"to find me a new Lord High Kidnapper."""
"The king was right concerning the lampooners, for soon they had the"
"story, and he became the laughing-stock of London, though Frances's name"
was not mentioned.
It is a significant index to the morals of our time that the king's
attempt to kidnap a woman in the streets of London should have aroused
laughter rather than indignation.
"As it was, the kidnapping episode brought no harm to my cousin, but she"
"did not want it to happen again, and so was careful to take a trusted"
escort with her when she went abroad thereafter.
CHAPTER X
AT THE MAID'S GARTER
"Betty was confined to her room during the greater part of the next month,"
and Frances visited her frequently. Notwithstanding my vows not to see
"Betty, I was compelled to go with Frances as her body-guard. I even went"
so far in my feeble effort to keep my resolution as to suggest Churchill
"as a body-guard, but Frances objected, and the quality of my good intent"
"was not enduring. So I went with my cousin, and the joy in Betty's eyes"
whenever we entered her room was not the sort that would come because she
"""No,"" she answered in that hard voice, by which I knew that mention of"
"Yolande's name had displeased her.  ""Remember that we are friends, and"
"that sometimes we have interests in common.  Therefore, take this piece"
"of advice from an old woman who knows."""
"""Knows what?"""
"""Knows that your friendship with the pretty Yolande is dangerous--"
"extremely dangerous."""
CHAPTER TEN.
CONFESSION.
"Next day, when the manservant asked me into the tiny boudoir in the Rue"
"de Courcelles, I found Yolande, in a pretty tea-gown of cream silk"
"adorned with lace and ribbons, seated in an armchair in an attitude of"
"weariness.  The sun-shutters were closed, as on the previous day, for"
"the heat in Paris that July was insufferable, and in the dim light her"
wan figure looked very fair and fragile.  The qualities which imparted
to her a distinct individuality were the beautiful combination of the
pastoral with the elegant--of simplicity with elevation--of spirit with
sweetness.
"She gave vent to a cry of gladness as I entered, rose, and stretching"
"out her hands in welcome, drew a seat for me close to her.  I looked at"
"her standing before me in her warm, breathing, human loveliness."
"""You are better, Yolande?  Ah! how glad I am!""  I commenced.  ""Last"
"night I believed that you were dead."""
"""And if I had died would it really have mattered so very much to you?"""
"_never_ find my way back to mamma. Goodby, Miss Romley."""
"Behind Pola's back Mr. Dugald cast such a despairing, apologetic and"
altogether furious look toward Sidney as to make Sidney suddenly laugh.
And with her laugh all her sense of dismay and humiliation vanished.
She forgot her red hands and the big gingham apron and the dishes
spread about her in her amusement over Pola's pathetic attempt to be
very grown-up and sophisticated. And _so_ ill-bred! How ashamed Mr.
Dugald had been of her!
Then a thought struck Sidney with such force that she sat down in the
"nearest chair. Why, if Mr. Dugald was Pola's own cousin, belonged to"
"the grandeur that was Pola's, he would _never_ be attracted by poor,"
plain Trude. Her beautiful hopes were shattered! She felt distinctly
aggrieved.
"However, there was Vick. Sidney hated to give Mr. Dugald to Vick, who"
"always got everything, yet it seemed the only thing to do if any of the"
"sisters were to have him. Almost sadly she went to her room, opened her"
"satchel and took from it a small framed photograph of Victoria, a"
"photograph which, while it did not flatter Victoria, paid full justice"
"to her enticing beauty. Considering it, Sidney reflected on how lucky"
it was that at the last moment she had put the pictures of her sisters
into her baggage. Then she carried it to the kitchen and stood it on
the narrow mantel next to the clock where Mr. Dugald's eyes must surely
find it. Unlike the snapshot of Trude the picture remained there
undisturbed.
CHAPTER XVII
The grim smile on the countenance of old Pépe of the Eleven Wounds grew
yet more grim.
"""No gipsy planned it and no man!"" he said sententiously. ""Come hither,"
"Chica!"""
And out from among the listening throng came a girl of thirteen or
"fourteen, dressed neatly and simply in a grey linen blouse belted at the"
"waist with a leather belt. A gay plaid, striped of orange and crimson,"
"hung neatly folded over her shoulder, and she rested her small sunburnt"
hand on the silver hilt of a pistol. Black elf-locks escaped from
beneath a red silk kerchief knotted saucily after the fashion of her
"companions. But her eyes, instead of being beady and black with that"
"far-away contemplative look which characterises the children of Egypt,"
were bright and sunny and blue as the Mediterranean itself in the front
of spring.
"""Come hither, Chica--be not afraid,"" repeated old Pépe of the Eleven"
"Wounds, ""this is a great man--the greatest of all our race. You have"
"heard of him--as who, indeed, has not!"""
Chica nodded with a quick elfish grin of intense pleasure and
"appreciation. ""I was listening,"" she said, ""I heard all. And I"
"saw--would that I could see it again. Oh, if only the like would happen"
"to me!"""
"""Tell the noble Don José who you are, my pretty Chica,"" said Pépe,"
soothingly.
But the child stamped her sandalled foot. It was still white at the
"instep, and the sergeant could see by the blue veins that she had not"
"""Yes.  Have you brought the hydrated peroxide of iron?"""
"For answer the Frenchman produced the tiny tube, saying:"
"""Then you suspect poison?"""
"""Most certainly,"" he replied; and, taking a glass, he placed a single"
"pillule in it, dissolving it in water, which he afterwards forced"
between the grey lips of my unconscious love.  Afterwards he glanced at
"his watch, observing: ""We must give another in fifteen minutes."""
"Then, drawing a chair to the bedside, he seated himself, holding her"
wrist and watching her countenance for any change that might take place
there.
"""Have you no idea of the nature of the poison?""  I inquired eagerly."
"""None,"" he responded.  ""Ask me no questions now.  When we have brought"
her round will be time enough.  It should be sufficient for you to know
that she is not dead.  Why not leave us for the present?  Go and break
"the good news to the Countess."""
"""You wish to be alone?"""
"""Yes.  This is a serious matter.  Leave us undisturbed, and on no"
"pretext allow her mother to enter here."""
"Thus urged, and feeling reassured by their statement that she still"
lived and that the pulsations of her heart were already quite
"perceptible, I left the room, noiselessly closing the door after me, and"
sought the Countess in the small blue boudoir to which she had returned
plunged in grief and dark despair.
prepared paper flat on the forehead of the dead man.
"When he withdrew it, I could see that it bore marks of the lines on his"
"head. Without a word, Kennedy drew from his pocket a print of the"
photograph of the smudge on Schloss’ door.
"“It is possible,” he said, half to himself, “to identify a person by"
"means of the arrangement of the sweat glands or pores. Poroscopy, Dr."
"Edmond Locard, director of the Police Laboratory at Lyons, calls it."
"The shape, arrangement, number per square centimeter, all vary in"
"different individuals. Besides, here we have added the lines of the"
forehead.”
He was studying the two impressions intensely. When he looked up from
"his examination, his face wore a peculiar expression."
“This is not the head which was placed so close to the glass of the
"door of Schloss’ office, peering through, on the night of the robbery,"
in order to see before picking the lock whether the office was empty
and everything ready for the hasty attack on the safe.”
"“That disposes of my theory that Schloss robbed himself,” remarked"
"Winters reluctantly. “But the struggle here, the sleeve of the dress,"
the pistol—could he have been shot?”
"“No, I think not,” considered Kennedy. “It looks to me more like a case"
of apoplexy.”
"“What shall we do?” asked Winters. “Far from clearing anything up, this"
complicates it.”
“Where’s Muller?” asked Kennedy. “Does he know? Perhaps he can shed
"visible, and from a first shyness that did not lack charm he expanded"
"briskly. After visiting a ""dry"" café, to seal this fortunate"
acquaintanceship--as he insisted upon calling it--he warmed up to us and
"we to him, with the result that his bags were soon carried down and"
"stowed in our spare stateroom. Leaving him there, we went on deck."
"""Dragot,"" Tommy mused. ""Speaks with a slight accent, but I can't make"
"out what!"""
"""Roumanian, possibly,"" I suggested, ""as he comes from there."""
"""You rather excel yourself,"" he smiled. ""Registering from Roumania,"
"however, isn't prima facie evidence that he's a Roumanian."""
"""He's a clever little talker, all the same."""
"""Right O! Too clever. I'm wondering if we aren't a pair of chumps to"
"take him."""
"""Why?"""
"""He may be a crook, for all we know. Did you notice what he said about"
"holding a commission from Azuria, and then hurrying to explain that"
Azuria isn't on the ordinary maps--just a wee bit of a kingdom up in the
"Carpathians, yet in the confines of Roumania? I call that fishy!"""
"""Not entirely so, Tommy. When you said it might now be turning into a"
"republic, did you notice how proudly he declared that the descendants of"
"Basil the Wolf couldn't be humbled?--that, situated in Moldavia, and"
"escaping the ravages of the Bulgarian army, they were stronger today"
"than ever?"""
"Two of its nine satellites were in sight at the moment, with a third"
edging over the western rim.
"""Makes you think you're drunk and seeing triple, doesn't it?"""
"commented Dex, who was staring out the thick glass panel beside Brand."
"""Nine moons! Almost enough for one planet!"""
"Brand nodded abstractly, and concentrated on the control board."
Rapidly the ship rocketed down toward the surface. The disk became a
"whirling, gigantic plate; and then an endless plain, with cloud"
formations beginning to take on definite outline.
"""About to enter Jupiter's atmosphere."" Brand spoke into the radio"
transmitter. Over the invisible thread of radio connection between the
"space ship and Earth, four hundred million miles behind, flashed the"
message.
"""All right. For God's sake, be careful,"" came the answer, minutes"
"later. ""Say something at least every half hour, to let us know"
"communication is unbroken. We will sound at ten second intervals."""
"The sounding began: _peep_, a shrill little piping noise like the"
fiddle of a cricket. Ten seconds later it came again: _peep_.
"Thereafter, intermittently, it keened through the control room--a"
"homely, comforting sound to let them know that there was a distant"
thread between them and Earth.
*       *       *       *       *
Lower the shell rocketed. The endless plain slowly ceased its rushing
underneath them as they entered the planet's atmosphere and began to
be pulled around with it in its revolution. Far to the west a faint
A low exclamation from Craig attracted my attention from Winters. In a
corner he had discovered a small box and had opened it. Inside was a
"dry battery and a most peculiar instrument, something like a little"
flat telephone transmitter yet attached by wires to earpieces that
fitted over the head after the manner of those of a wireless detector.
"“What’s this?” asked Kennedy, dangling it before Muller."
He looked at it phlegmatically. “A deaf instrument I have been working
"on,” replied the jeweler. “My hearing is getting poor.”"
Kennedy looked hastily from the instrument to the man.
"“I think I’ll take it along with us,” he said quietly."
"Winters, true to his instincts, had been searching Muller in the"
meantime. Besides the various assortment that a man carries in his
"pockets usually, including pens, pencils, notebooks, a watch, a"
"handkerchief, a bunch of keys, one of which was large enough to open a"
"castle, there was a bunch of blank and unissued pawn-tickets bearing"
"the name, “Stein’s One Per Cent. a Month Loans,” and an address on the"
Bowery.
"Was Muller the “fence” we were seeking, or only a tool for the “fence”"
higher up? Who was this Stein?
What it all meant I could only guess. It was a far cry from the wealth
"of Diamond Lane to a dingy Bowery pawnshop, even though pawnbroking at"
"one per cent. a month—and more, on the side—pays. I knew, too, that"
"diamonds are hoarded on the East Side as nowhere else in the world,"
"outside of India. It was no uncommon thing, I had heard, for a"
"I jumped out and tried the door. It was locked, and I banged loudly"
without getting any answer. It would not do to lose an unnecessary
"minute, for the many miles we should have to walk later on loomed"
"unpleasantly ahead, but I knew there were pretty certain to be water"
"and washing-basin behind that door, and did not intend to leave them"
"unused if I could help it, _chokidar_ or no _chokidar_. So, I took a"
"butting run with my shoulder, the door gave, and I set out in search"
of the water tub.
"An open door on my right showed me a small room, absolutely empty,"
except for a row of tins against the wall. Knowing that petrol was
carried in such tin drums I went and examined them. The next moment
"Allan heard a shout that brought him hastily inside, wondering"
"whether I had gone mad, had been bitten by a wild beast, or was"
being murdered.
"""Look!"" I cried, as he came running up to me. ""Look at those tins and"
"tell me what's inside!"""
"Allan seized hold of one of the drums, read what was written on it,"
"gave it a shake, and we could both hear the blessed sound of lapping"
inside.
"""It's petrol, sir,"" he whispered in an awed voice."
Petrol in the desert--petrol where one would as soon have expected to
find a Bond Street jeweller!
At first we could neither of us believe it. Personally I imagined we
"had both got temporary jim-jams, but Allan, with his usual stolid,"
"common sense, opened one of the drums, tested the contents, and"
"had no use. Yet, yet--my original guess stuck firmly in my mind,"
"improbable though it might be, and had just been nailed down"
tightly--I scorn to mystify the reader--by a few simple sentences
spoken in French.
CHAPTER VII
THE MARINE SENTRY
We had a whole day to fill in before we could get any news of Dawson's
"vigil in the _Malplaquet_, and I have never known a day as drearily"
"long. Cary and I were both restless as peas on a hot girdle, and could"
not settle down to talk or to read or to write. Cary sought vainly to
persuade me to read and pass judgment upon his Navy Book. In spite of
my interest in the subject my soul revolted at the forbidding pile of
manuscript. I promised to read the proofs and criticise them with
"severity, but as for the M.S.--no, thanks. Poor Cary needed all his"
sweet patience to put up with me. By eleven o'clock we had become
"unendurable to one another, and I gladly welcomed his suggestion to"
"adjourn to his club, have lunch there, and try to inveigle the"
"Commander of the _Malplaquet_ into our net. ""I know him,"" said Cary."
"""He is a fine fellow; and though he must be pretty busy, he will be"
glad to lunch somewhere away from the ship. If we have luck we will go
"back with him and look over the _Malplaquet_ ourselves."""
"""If you can manage that, Cary, you will have my blessing."""
He did manage to work the luncheon part by telephoning to the yard
"be prolonged, seeing that the glow of the sun-rising was already"
reddening the sky to the east.
Etienne was secretly fingering his beads. And El Sarria thought with
satisfaction of the safety of Dolóres; he had given up hope of Concha a
full hour ago. The ex-Miguelete had doubtless again played the traitor.
He took a cigarette from Rollo without speaking and followed him across
the uneven floor between the heaps of trodden grain.
"They were led down the stairway one by one, and as they passed through"
"the ground floor, with its thick woolly coating of grey flour dust, a"
"trumpet blew without, and they heard the trampling of horses in the"
courtyard.
"""Quick!"" said a voice at Rollo's elbow, ""here is your chocolate. Nothing"
like it for strengthening the knee-joints at a time like this. I've seen
"men die on wine and on rum and on brandy; but for me, give me a cup of"
"chocolate as good as that, when my time comes!"""
Rollo drank the thick sweet strength-giving stuff to the accompaniment
of clattering hoofs and jingling accoutrements.
"""Come!"" said a voice again, ""give me the cup. Do not keep the general"
"waiting. He is in no good temper this morning, and we are to march"
"immediately."""
The young man stepped out of the mill-door into the crisp chill of the
"dawn. All the east was a glory of blood-red cloud, and for the second"
time Rollo and his companions stood face to face with General Cabrera.
It was within a quarter of an hour of the sun-rising.
"been the crowning blow to her."""
"""I have told madame your mother everything,"" I said.  ""Do not be uneasy"
"on her account."""
"""Ah,"" she sighed, ""how I regret that we came to Paris!  I regret it all,"
"Gerald, save that you and I have met again;"" and she stretched out her"
"hand until it came into contact with my coat-button, with which she"
toyed like a child.
"""And this meeting has really given you satisfaction?""  I whispered to"
"her, heedless of the presence of the others."
"""Not only satisfaction,"" she answered, so softly that I alone could"
"catch her words, and looking into my face with that expression of"
"passionate affection which can never be simulated; ""it has given back to"
"me a desire for happiness, for life, for love."""
"There were tears in those wonderful blue eyes, and her small hand"
trembled within my grasp.  My heart at that moment was too full for mere
"words.  True, I loved her with a mad fondness that I had never before"
"entertained for any woman; yet, nevertheless, a hideous shadow arose"
"between us, shutting her off from me for ever--the shadow of her"
"secret--the secret that she, my well-beloved, was actually a spy."
CHAPTER NINE.
AT THE ELYSEE.
"Having reassured myself of Yolande's recovery, I was compelled to rush"
"off, slip into uniform, and attend a dinner at the Elysee.  The function"
"was a brilliant affair, as are all the official junketings of the French"
Then the other said to me:
"""This is a thing I have never told anyone yet, but I will tell it to you"
now. There are times when I almost wish I could see German troops
marching victoriously through the streets of London. It is not my reason
"that is speaking now, but my bitterness, which has become stronger than"
"my reason."""
I understood him far too well to make any comment.
"And then after a long silence, I said: ""I wonder if anybody else thinks"
"like that."""
"And he answered: ""Yes, there are many--more than you would believe."""
"But the first added: ""We must remain neutral--that is our one and only"
"duty. The more malevolent our neutrality the better, but it must be"
neutrality. Remember that there are Germans whose bitterness prompts
them to wish that British troops were marching through the streets of
"Berlin. I think their wish is juster than yours, but both wishes cannot"
"be fulfilled, and it is therefore desirable that the next best thing"
"should happen, namely, that both the Allies and their enemies should be"
"entirely deprived of victory."""
"I agreed, but added:"
"""Yes, fundamentally one must remain neutral, but in relation to present"
circumstances one cannot remain neutral. It is our business to arraign
"England, our own country, and not Germany. It is for every nation to"
discover its own faults. There are many Germans of courage and honesty
who will condemn their country for the crimes she has committed. But
prove that; but I doubt if they could ever analyze that atomic motor
"with no hint as to how it works."""
"Silence descended on them again, in which each was lost in his own"
thoughts.
"How many hours had passed, the Earthmen did not know. They had spent"
the time in fruitless planning to escape from their tower room and go
back to the ship again. Though how they could get away in the ship
when the Rogans seemed able to propel it where-ever they wished
"against the utmost power of their motor, they did not attempt to"
consider.
"One of Jupiter's short nights had passed, however--a night weirdly"
"made as light as day by red glares from the plates, which seemed to"
"store up sunlight, among their other functions--and the tiny sun had"
risen to slant into their window at a sharp angle.
Suddenly they heard the familiar drawing of the great bolts outside
"their door. It was opened, and a dozen or more of the Rogans came in,"
with Greca cowering piteously in their midst and attempting to
communicate her distress to Brand.
*       *       *       *       *
At the head of the little band of Rogans was one the prisoners had not
"seen before. He was of great height, fully two feet taller than the"
others; and he carried himself with an air that proclaimed his
importance.
"The tall one turned to Greca and addressed a few high-pitched, squeaky"
"words to her. She shook her head; whereupon, at a hissed command, two"
"that we have Ned Nestor, the alleged juvenile detective, at our camp. He"
"seems inclined to keep what information he possesses to himself, and,"
"before proceeding to extreme measures with him, we decided to lay the"
case before you. I am afraid Nestor will receive rough treatment at the
hands of my allies unless the information they demand is given them.”
"“So that was a lying message you sent Nestor, was it?”"
"“There’s no use in discussing the matter at length,” the other stated."
“I think I’d better take you boys into camp and let the boss talk with
"you. And let me warn you now, before anything more is said, not to"
"attempt resistance. If you do, there’ll be shooting done, and it won’t"
"be my men who will get hurt! Now, face about to the north and march away"
"to camp, like good little boys. We don’t want to hurt you, but we insist"
on having our way in the matter of this information. Perhaps Nestor may
be able to convince you that you ought not to be so obstinate.”
"“I don’t think Nestor will attempt anything of the kind,” replied Jack,"
“and I think that you are a great big bluff!”
CHAPTER X
GILROY AND THE BEAR
"When, at last, Ned and Jimmie, still watching about for hostile forces,"
"came to the barricaded camp, the fire had burned down and no one was in"
sight. Ned regarded the wall of rock with a smile.
“Isn’t that great?” Jimmie asked.
"""Stand aside,"" Peasley ordered, gruffly; but the other held his ground,"
"saying, quietly:"
"""I warn you. I am desperate."""
"""Shall I stop her, sir?"" the quartermaster asked from the shadows of"
the wheel-house.
"""No!"" Emerson commanded, sharply, and in the glow from the"
"binnacle-light they saw he had drawn his revolver, while on the instant"
"up from the void beneath heaved the massive figure of Big George Balt,"
"a behemoth, more colossal and threatening than ever in the dim light."
"Rumbling curses as he came, he leaped up the pilot-house steps,"
"wrenched open the door, and with one sweep of his hairy paw flung the"
"helmsman from his post, panting,"
"""Keep her going, Cap', or I'll run them down!"""
"""We stood by you, old man,"" Emerson urged; ""you stand by us. They can't"
"make you stop. They can't come aboard."""
"The launch was abreast of them now, and skimming along so close that"
one might have tossed a biscuit aboard of her. For an instant Captain
Peasley hesitated; then Emerson saw the ends of his bristly mustache
rise above an expansive grin as he winked portentously. But his voice
was convincingly loud and wrathful as he replied:
"""What do you mean, sir? I'll have my blooming ship libelled for this."""
"""I'll make good your losses,"" Emerson volunteered, quickly, realizing"
that other ears were open.
"Rollo was about to speak, but the Sergeant whispered that the old lady"
"was now in such good case to admit them, that she might be frighted by"
his foreign accent.
In a few moments the woman could be heard stiffly and grumblingly
"descending the stairs, the door was opened, and Rebeca appeared with the"
key in her hand.
"""How many are there of your party?"" she asked, her poor hand shaking so"
"that she could scarcely fit the key in the lock, and her voice sunk to a"
quavering whisper.
"""There are five men of us and two women,"" said the Sergeant, quickly."
"""Now we are all within, pray give me the key and show us the road to the"
"Queen's apartments."""
"""Two women!"" grumbled the poor old creature, whose mind appeared to be"
"somewhat unhinged; ""that will never suit her Royal Highness the Regent,"
"especially if they are young and well-looking. She loves not such, any"
"more than I love the hussy of the pork-shop. Though, indeed, my man hath"
"not the roving eye in his head as her Señor Muñoz hath. Ah, the saints"
have mercy on all poor deserted women! But what am I saying? If the
"Lady Cristina heard me speak ill of him, she would set my poor old neck"
"in the garrote. Then--crack--all would be over!"""
"The party now advanced towards the palace, which in the gloom of a"
"starless night was still entirely hidden from their sight, save as a"
darker mass set square against the black vault of heaven.
By this time Concha and La Giralda had taken the trembling portress by
"the arms, and were bringing her along in the van, whispering comfort in"
"""Uncanonical!"" roared the Abbot. ""I scorn the charge! I"
"scorn it with my heels! Two masses daily,--morning and"
"evening--Primes,--Nones,--Vespers,--Aves,--Credos,--Paters--"""
"""Excepting on moonlight nights,"" the duke blinked."
"""Exceptis excipiendis,"" replied the Abbot."
"""Sheer heresy!"" roared the duke. ""The devil is apt to keep an eye on"
"such exceptions. Does he not go about like a roaring lion?"""
"""Let him roar!"" shouted the Abbot, bringing his fist down upon the"
"table, and looking about in canonical ire, when the door opened"
noiselessly and in its dark frame stood Francesco.
He had waited at the camp for the return of the duke until his misery
"and restlessness had mastered every other sensation. Sleep, he felt,"
"would not come to his eyes, and he craved for action. He should have"
"liked nothing better than to mount his steed on the spot, ride"
single-handed into Anjou's camp and redeem his honor in the eyes of
those who regarded him a bought instrument of the Church. The memory
of Ilaria wailed through the dark chambers of his heart. He felt at
"this moment, more than ever, what she had been to him, and to himself"
"he appeared as a derelict, tossed on a vast and shoreless sea."
"For a moment he gazed as one spellbound at the drinkers, then he"
strode up to the duke and shook him soundly.
"""To the rescue, my lord duke!"" he shouted, in the excess of his"
"frenzy, till the vaults re-echoed his cry from their farthest"
"recesses. ""Conradino has been betrayed by the Frangipani!"""
CHAPTER V
BAFFLED
"When at last I arrived at Cary's flat it was very late, and I was"
exceedingly tired and out of temper. A squadron of Zeppelins had been
"reported from the sea, the air-defence control at Newcastle had sent"
"out the preliminary warning ""F.M.W.,"" and the speed of my train had"
been reduced to about fifteen miles an hour. I had expected to get in
"to dinner, but it was eleven o'clock before I reached my destination."
"I had not even the satisfaction of seeing a raid, for the Zepps, made"
"cautious by recent heavy losses, had turned back before crossing the"
"line of the coast. Cary and his wife fell upon my neck, for we were"
"old friends, condoled with me, fed me, and prescribed a tall glass of"
mulled port flavoured with cloves. My stern views upon the need for
Prohibition in time of war became lamentably weakened.
"By midnight I had recovered my philosophic outlook upon life, and Cary"
began to enlighten me upon the details of the grave problem which had
brought me eagerly curious to his city.
"""I expect that Dawson will drop in some time to-night,"" he said. ""All"
"hours are the same to him. I told him that you were on the way, and he"
"wants to give you the latest news himself. He is dead set upon you,"
"Copplestone. I can't imagine why."""
"""Am I then so very unattractive?"" I inquired drily. ""It seems to me"
"that Dawson is a man of sound judgment."""
"""I confess that I do not understand why he lavishes so much attention"
A MISTAKEN IDEA
'Yet Australia has been talking freely enough about the Japanese
menace.'
'I know. It is quite a mistaken idea of the Australians that if Japan
triumphs in the present war she would be a menace to Australia. They say
that if we win we shall be masters of the East and the paramount power
"in Eastern waters. What, they ask, is to become of Australia, if we take"
it into our heads to make a descent upon their shores?'
"Baron Suyematsu again laughed boisterously, as one who can afford to"
make merry at an extravagant idea.
"'The whole thing is so utterly preposterous,' he went on, 'that it"
would not be worth considering were it not typical of what is being said
all over Europe. Our fight for national existence against Russia has
been misconstrued everywhere. We seem to have filled the Western world
"with all sorts of vague fears, France is saying that we shall soon"
deprive her of Indo-China. Germany declares we have designs on
Kiao-chau. The Dutch say that Java is no longer safe from our
"machinations. Never was such nonsense talked of a country which, after"
"all, is but fighting to preserve its national existence.'"
'And you say Japan has no intention of arming the Asiatics against the
Europeans?'
'The whole idea is absurd. Japan wishes to become one with the European
nations. I might even say she aspires to become a member of the European
family. It is a mistake to think that Japan is going to form a
Pan-Asiatic Association. Japan is the only country in the East that can
rise on European lines. Her example could not be followed by other
"“If you can explain,” he began rather stiffly, “why you—”"
"“Dear,” she interrupted, “listen. It was an hour’s pain and trial to"
you. I did it for her—I mean the girl who spoke to me on the coach. I
"was so happy, Jim—so happy with you that I didn’t dare to refuse that"
"happiness to another. Jim, they were married only this morning—those"
two; and I wanted him to get away. While they were struggling with you
I saw him slip from behind his tree and hurry across the park. That’s
"all of it, dear—I had to do it.”"
Thus does one sister of the plain gold band know another who stands in
the enchanted light that shines but once and briefly for each one. By
rice and satin bows does mere man become aware of weddings. But bride
knoweth bride at the glance of an eye. And between them swiftly passes
comfort and meaning in a language that man and widows wot not of.
THE ROMANCE OF A BUSY BROKER
"Pitcher, confidential clerk in the office of Harvey Maxwell, broker,"
allowed a look of mild interest and surprise to visit his usually
expressionless countenance when his employer briskly entered at half
past nine in company with his young lady stenographer. With a snappy
"“Good-morning, Pitcher,” Maxwell dashed at his desk as though he were"
"intending to leap over it, and then plunged into the great heap of"
letters and telegrams waiting there for him.
The young lady had been Maxwell’s stenographer for a year. She was
beautiful in a way that was decidedly unstenographic. She forewent the
“Cardinal Spada is a very intelligent man and a very amiable one. At
"heart he is a Liberal and fond of the French. As to the Abbé Tardieu, he"
is a very influential priest at the church of San Luigi.”
After lunch they went direct to a solitary street in the old part of
"Rome. At the door of the big, sad palace where Cardinal Spada lived, a"
"porter with a cocked hat, a grey greatcoat, and a staff with a silver"
"knob, was watching the few passers-by."
"They went in by the broad entry-way, as far as a dark colonnaded court,"
paved with big flags which had grass between them.
In the middle of the court a fountain shot up a little way and fell into
a stone basin covered with moss.
Kennedy and Cæsar mounted the wide monumental stairway; on the first
floor a handsome glassed-in gallery ran around the court. The whole
house had an air of solemnity and sadness. They entered the Cardinal’s
"office, which was a large, sad, severe room."
"Monsignor Spada was a vigorous man, despite his age. He looked frank"
"and intelligent, but one guessed that there was a hidden bitterness and"
desolation in him. He wore a black cassock with red edges and buttons.
"Kennedy went close and was about to kneel to the Cardinal, but he"
prevented him.
Cæsar explained his ideas to the Cardinal with modesty. He felt that
this man was worthy of all his respect.
"Monsignor Spada listened attentively, and then said that he understood"
"nothing about financial matters, but that on principle he was in favour"
"""Hello, white folks! Here we are, all together again."""
They turned to behold a villanous-looking man beaming benignly upon
"them. He was dirty, his clothes were in rags, and through a riotous"
bristle of beard that hid his thin features a mangy patch showed on
"either cheek. It was undeniably ""Fingerless"" Fraser, but how changed,"
how altered from that radiant flower of indolence they had known! He
"was pallid, emaciated, and bedraggled; his attitude showed hunger and"
"abuse, and his bony joints seemed about to pierce through their"
"tattered covering. As they stood speechless with amazement, he made his"
identification complete by protruding his tongue from the corner of his
mouth and gravely closing one eye in a wink of exceeding wisdom.
"""Fraser!"" they cried in chorus, then fell upon him noisily, shaking his"
grimy hands and slapping his back until he coughed weakly. Summoned by
"their shouts, Big George broke in upon the incoherent greeting, and at"
sight of his late comrade began to laugh hoarsely.
"""Glad to see you, old man!"" he cried, ""but how did you get here?"""
"Fraser drew himself up with injured dignity, then spoke in dramatic"
"accents. ""I worked my way!"" He showed the whites of his eyes,"
tragically.
"""You look like you'd walked in from Kansas,"" George declared."
"""Yes, sir, I _worked! Me!""_"
"""How? Where?"""
"""On that bloody wind-jammer."" He stretched a long arm toward the harbor"
in a theatrical gesture.
and to the last possessed that loftiness of spirit wedded to sombre
fatalism which is the heritage of the Latins. He was at war with his
"kindred of Italy and France, and with the English among whom he had"
"been brought up, and whom he loved. He was their enemy by accident of"
"birth, but though he might and did love his foes better than his"
"German friends of Austria and Prussia, yet he had taken the oath of"
"faithful service, and kept it to the end. I could understand why"
"Dawson--that strange human bloodhound, in whom the ruthless will"
continually struggled with and kept under the very tender heart--would
allow no one to slander Trehayne.
"Cary was watching me eagerly, waiting for me to read the letter."
"Dawson's head was resting on one hand, and his face was turned away,"
"so that I could not see it. He could not wholly conceal his emotion,"
but he would not let us see more of it than he could help. He did not
move once during my reading.

"_To Chief Inspector William Dawson, C.I.D._"
"SIR,"
"Will you be surprised, my friend, when you read this that I have left"
"for you, to learn that I, your right-hand man in the unending spy"
"hunt, I whom you have called your bright jewel of a pupil, Petty"
"Officer John Trehayne, R.N.V.R., am at this moment upon the books of"
"the Austrian Navy as a sub-lieutenant, seconded for Secret Service?"
Have you ever been surprised by anything? I don't know. You have said
often in my hearing that you suspect every one. Have you suspected me?
"Sometimes when I have caught that sidelong squint of yours, that"
"Astura poured boiling pitch upon the heads of the attacking party,"
hurled rocks of huge dimensions down upon them which crushed into a
"mangled mass scores of men, unable to retain the vantage they had"
"gained under the avalanche of arrows, rocks and fire."
In a moment's time the situation was changed.
"Noiselessly as leopards, the duke's men fell upon their rear, raising"
"their war-cry as they leaped from the shadows. Those on the ramparts,"
"forced to grapple with the nearer enemy, abandoned their tasks. The"
"Pisans, profiting by the lull, swarmed over the walls. Taken between"
"two parties, a deadly hand-to-hand conflict ensued. Above the din and"
"the roar of the hurricane, of the clashing of arms, above the cries"
"of the wounded, the death-rattle of the dying, sounded the voice of"
the Duke of Spoleto.
"""Onward, my men! Kill and slay!"""
Side by side the duke and Francesco leaped into the thickest of the
"fray, both animated by the same desire to come face to face with the"
"lords of Astura, spurning a lesser enemy."
For a time they seemed doomed to disappointment. Had the Frangipani
been slain?
The zest of the conflict pointed rather to their directing the
defence. Else their mercenaries would have left Astura to its fate.
Suddenly an unearthly voice startled the combatants.
"""Guard, devil, guard!"""
"consolation we can find lies in the fact that we know it."""
"""Most fools lack that flattering unction,"" returned Frances, musingly."
"""Perhaps you will take more interest in this matter when I tell you"
"that it is not Betty I propose to see,"" I answered. ""I am deliberately"
"offering to take you to see some one else who is about to leave England."""
"She stood on tiptoe and kissed my lips for answer, then sank into a"
"chair, covering her face with her hands to hide the sudden tears."
I went to the window and waited till she was calm. I longed to comfort
her by telling of the faint prospect of good fortune that lay in Le
"Grand's letter, but I hesitated raising a hope which might never be"
realized.
"At the end of five minutes I went to her and said: ""Let me ask the"
"duchess to excuse you for to-night, and in the morning I'll meet you on"
"Bowling Green stairs, at, say, seven o'clock."""
"""I'll be there,"" she answered, smiling through her tears."
"The next morning we took boat, and the tide running out, made good speed"
"to the Bridge, hastened to the Old Swan, and found George in his printing"
"shop awaiting us. I remained in the old tapestried room, leaving Frances"
and George to say their farewells. In the course of a few minutes he
"called me in. He had donned his Quaker disguise, and on the floor near"
"him was a small bundle of linen. Frances was weeping, and George's voice"
was choked with emotion.
"""Well, at last, Baron Ned, you are to be rid of me,"" he said, glancing"
toward the bundle at his feet.
"contact with the rough branches of the tree, and these he thought"
necessary to nurse carefully with his handkerchief.
"“Oh my!” laughed Jimmie, as the fat confidential clerk struggled under"
difficulties to make himself more presentable. “If you think you’re in a
"muss, just look at this beautiful new khaki uniform I put on only a day"
"or two ago! It’s a peach, ain’t it?”"
"“It certainly is in a mess,” admitted Gilroy."
"“Of course,” grinned Jimmie. “I fell down a chute, and rolled into the"
"basement of a mountain, and climbed up a smutty chimney, and fell into a"
secret passage and had all kinds of sport! Ned and I have had a glorious
morning. You should have been with us.”
"The confidential clerk frowned slightly, but made no reply."
"When the boys reached the camp, after giving a great deal of mental and"
"physical assistance to the clerk, they found it just as they had left"
it. The boys had not returned.
"“Now, what kind of blockheads do you think they are to go away and leave"
the camp like this?” Jimmie asked.
"The boy did not know, of course, that his own signal, shown from the"
"granite rock, had led to their departure, and also to their subsequent"
encounter with the half-breeds.
"“We don’t know why they left,” Ned answered, “but we must suppose that"
they had some good reason for doing so.”
"“Do I understand,” Gilroy asked, “that something has happened to your"
"everything close to the chest, but still. He would have felt better if"
"Michael Vance, Jr., had favored him with a little more trust."
"On the other hand, keeping the details of the operation under wraps as"
long as possible was probably wise. It minimized the chance for some
inadvertent slip-up.
"Yes, it was definitely best. Because he was staring across his desk at"
"four of Tanzan Mino's Tokyo _kobun_, all dressed in shiny black leather"
"jackets. They'd arrived at the Docklands office just after dawn,"
announcing they were there to hand-deliver the money to Tokyo. Jiro
Sato had directed them to Westminster Union.
"The four all carried black briefcases, which did not contain business"
papers. They intended to accomplish their mission by whatever means
"necessary. Jiro Sato, the London _oyabun_, had not been invited to send"
his people along with them this morning. He was now humiliated and dis-
"graced, officially removed from the operation, on Tokyo's orders. The"
"regional office had failed, so Tokyo had sent in a _Mino-gumi_ version"
of the Delta Force. They clearly had orders concerning what to do with
Michael Vance.
"He didn't like this new twist. For everything to go according to plan,"
violence had to be kept out of it. There was no way he and Michael
could go head to head with street enforcers. If Michael was thinking of
"doing that, the man was crazy."
"He glanced at his gold Omega, noting that it read ten- nineteen. In"
eleven more minutes he'd know how Michael intended to run the scenario.
"But whatever happened, he wasn't going to be intimidated by these"
"_kobun_ hoods, dark sunglasses and automatics notwithstanding. Those"
CHAPTER XXIII
THE POTTER'S WHEEL
'Life is like a great whirlpool wherein we are dashed to and fro by
our passions.'--_Saying of the Buddha._
"It is a hard teaching, this of the Buddha about death. It is a teaching"
"that may appeal to the reason, but not to the soul, that when life goes"
"out, this thing which we call 'I' goes out with it, and that love and"
remembrance are dead for ever.
It is so hard a teaching that in its purity the people cannot believe
"it. They accept it, but they have added on to it a belief which changes"
"the whole form of it, a belief that is the outcome of that weakness of"
humanity which insists that death is not and cannot be all.
"Though to the strict Buddhist death is the end of all worldly passion,"
"to the Burmese villager that is not so. He cannot grasp, he cannot"
"endure that it should be so, and he has made for himself out of Buddhism"
a belief that is opposed to all Buddhism in this matter.
"He believes in the transmigration of souls, in the survival of the 'I.'"
"The teaching that what survives is not the 'I,' but only the result of"
"its action, is too deep for him to hold. True, if a flame dies the"
"effects that it has caused remain, and the flame is dead for ever. A new"
"flame is a new flame. But the 'I' of man cannot die, he thinks; it lives"
and loves for all time.
"surely do as much for a mountain gipsy if, as you said just now, the"
"range is likely to be a short one!"""
Rollo began somewhat to change his opinion about the husband of the
"Queen. At first he had seemed both dandy and coward, a combination which"
Rollo held in the utmost contempt. But when Rollo had once seen him
"handle a gun, he began to have more respect for his recent Excellency"
the Duke of Rianzares.
"""Can you tell us, from your military experience,"" Rollo asked, ""which is"
"the most easily vulnerable part of this palace."""
"""It is easily vulnerable in every part,"" answered Muñoz, carelessly"
snapping the lock of a rifle again and again.
"""Nay, but be good enough to listen, sir,"" cried Rollo, with some heat."
"""There are women and children here. You do not know the gipsies. You do"
not know by whom they are led. You do not know the oaths of death and
"torture they have sworn----"""
"""By whom are they led?"" said Muñoz, still playing carelessly with the"
"rifle. ""I thought such fellows were mere savages from the hills, and"
"might be slaughtered like sheep."""
"""Perhaps--at any rate they are led by your own daughter!"" said Rollo,"
"briefly, growing nettled at the parvenu grandee's seeming indifference."
"""_My daughter!_"" cried Muñoz, losing in a moment his bright complexion,"
"and becoming of a slaty pallor, ""my daughter, that mad imp of hell--who"
"thrice has tried to assassinate me!"""
"And as he spoke, he let the gun fall upon the floor at his feet. Then he"
complete and solemn silence. Only in front of the door several
"she-goats, with bunching, over-full udders, waited to be milked with"
plaintive whimperings and tokens of unrest.
La Giralda looked at her companion. The Sergeant looked at La Giralda.
The same thought was in the heart of each.
"La Giralda went up quickly to the door, and knocked loudly. At"
"farmhouses in Old Castile it is necessary to knock loudly, for the"
"family lives on the second floor, while the first is given up to bundles"
"of fuel, trusses of hay, household provender of the more indestructible"
"sort, and one large dog which invariably answers the door first and"
expresses in an unmistakable manner his intention of making his
breakfast off the stranger's calves.
But not even the dog responded to the clang of La Giralda's oaken cudgel
"on the stout door panels. Accordingly she stepped within, and without"
"ceremony ascended the stairs. In the house-place, extended on a bed, lay"
"a woman of her own age, dead, her face wearing an expression of the"
utmost agony.
In a low trundle-bed by the side of the other was a little girl of four.
"Her hands clasped a doll of wood tightly to her bosom. But her eyes,"
"though open, were sightless. She also was dead."
"La Giralda turned and came down the stairs, shaking her head mournfully."
"""These at least are ours,"" she said, when she came out into the hot"
"summer air, pointing to the little flock of goats. ""There is none to"
"hinder us."""
"""Have the owners fled?"" asked the Sergeant, quickly."

He had just begun to work into a wonderful anecdote about his brother
when the dinner gong rang. Butt told me to scat. He said I was a
"growing tadpole and needed my vitamins. And he mentioned, very"
"off-hand, that he wouldn't at all object if I brought him some fresh"
fruit. It seemed there was nothing but processed foods in the lifeboat
and Butt was used to a farmer's diet.
"Trouble was, he was a special kind of farmer. Ordinary fruit would have"
been pretty easy to sneak into my pockets at meals. I even found a way
"to handle the kelp and giant watercress Mr. Brown liked, but things"
like seaweed salt and Venusian mud-grapes just had too strong a smell.
"Twice, the mechanical hamper refused to accept my jacket for laundering"
and I had to wash it myself. But I learned so many wonderful things
about Venus every time I visited that stowaway....
I learned three wild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that the
native Venusians hate so much; I learned how you tell the difference
between a lousy government paddlefoot from New Kalamazoo and the
"slaptoe slinker who is the planter's friend. After a lot of begging,"
"Butt Lee Brown explained the workings of his blaster, explained it"
so carefully that I could name every part and tell what it did from
the tiny round electrodes to the long spirals of transformer. But no
"matter what, he would never let me hold it."
"""Sorry, Ford, old tad,"" he would drawl, spinning around and around in"
and Francesco loosened the sword in the scabbard anticipating an
"ambush, when he pushed it back with a puzzled look. Before a wayside"
"shrine, almost entirely concealed by weeds, there knelt a grotesque"
figure at orisons. He either had not heard the tramp of Francesco's
"steed, or ignored it on purpose, for not until the latter called to"
"him did he turn, and with much relief Francesco recognized his former"
guide from the camp of the Duke of Spoleto.
"""Where is the camp of the duke?"" he queried curtly, impatient with the"
man's exhibition of secular godliness.
"""Many miles away,"" replied he of the goat's-beard, as he arose and"
kissed a little holly-wood cross that he carried.
"""Lead me to it!"""
"The godly little man flopped again, scraped some dust together with"
"his two hands, spat upon it, then smeared his forehead with the stuff,"
uttering the names of sundry saints.
Francesco had come to the end of his patience.
"""Get up, my friend,"" he said, ""we have had enough praying for one"
"day!"""
"The goatherd offered to anoint him with dust and spittle, pointing a"
"stumpy forefinger, but Francesco was filled with disgust. He caught"
the man by the girdle and lifted him to his feet.
"""Enough of this!"" he said. ""Is the devil so much your master?"""
"The goatherd blinked red-lidded and pious eyes, while he scanned the"
"defenders, roused from their feast of blood, had poured all their"
"defences towards the point of attack, leaving the northern slope to"
look to itself.
As they rode down the ravine there came from the bottom of the valley
the sharp yelp of a dog. It was instantly answered by a similar bark
from the very top of the castello.
"""No two dogs ever had the same voice,"" the duke turned to Francesco."
"""They must be hell-hounds, whom the fiend has trained to one tune. But"
"what is that yonder? A goat picking its way?"""
"""A goat walking on its hind legs!"""
"""Are there horns on its head?"""
"""No!""--"
"""Then it is not the Evil One! Forward, my men!"""
The pause that preceded the breaking of the storm had been unnaturally
"long. Save for the gleam of the lightnings, the waters had grown to an"
"inky blackness. There came one long moment, when the atmosphere sank"
under the weight of a sudden heat. Then the ever increasing thunder
"rushed upon the silence with a mighty roar and out of the west, driven"
"by the hurricane, came a long line of white waves, that rose as they"
"advanced, till the very Tritons beat their heads and the nymphs"
scurried down to greener depths.
"And now a sudden streak of fire hissed from the clouds, followed by a"
crash as if all the bolts of heaven had been let off at once. From the
"ramparts of Astura came cries of alarm, the din of battle, the blaring"
"“Runs through a pass, foolish!” answered Jack."
"“But there’s no break in the formation,” Frank insisted."
“Then it runs through a tunnel manufactured by itself!” Jack explained.
"“Anyway, it gets out somehow.”"
“What a dandy place to catch mountain trout!” shouted Harry.
fourteen hours at a stretch. They must be swift as lightning in their
"movements, and possessed of judgment, ability, and nerve."
"It was impossible, of course, for Bob to pick out an ideal rear crew"
from merely having seen the men in action for a scant few minutes. He
"did not try. He simply used his very excellent judgment, reserving"
"mentally the right to change his mind whenever he felt like it, and"
juggle the men around as he chose.
"The principal necessity was to start things moving. When he had done so,"
Bainbridge returned to camp with the twofold object of giving the cook
"his orders, and having a final settlement with Schaeffer. The latter was"
"not particularly pleasant, but it was important. The man must quit the"
crew at once. Bob had made up his mind not to let the fellow spend even
the night where he would have a chance to talk with and perhaps
"influence the others. With this determination uppermost, he passed by"
"the mess tent to the other where the men slept, pulled aside the flap,"
and stepped inside.
"The place was a mess of blankets and half-dried clothes, but to Bob’s"
surprise it was vacant of anything in the nature of a man. Evidently
"Schaeffer had recovered and vamoosed. Thoughtfully he sought the cook,"
and put the question.
"""Yes, we were fortunate in getting such good ones."""
"""You were fortunate in many ways. In fact you are a very lucky young"
"man."""
"""Indeed! How?"""
"""Well, don't you think you were lucky to beat that strike?"""
"""It wasn't altogether luck. However, I do consider myself fortunate in"
"escaping at the last moment,"" Boyd laughed easily. ""By the way, what"
"happened to the man they mistook for me?"""
"""Let him go, I believe. I didn't pay much attention to the matter."""
"Marsh had been using his eyes to good advantage, and, seeing the work"
"even better in hand than he had supposed, he was moved by irritation"
and the desire to goad his opponent to say more than he had intended:
"""I rather think you will have a lot to explain, one of these days,"" he"
"said, with deliberate menace."
"""With fifty thousand cases of salmon aboard _The Bedford Castle_ I will"
"explain anything. Meanwhile the police may go to the devil!"" The cool"
assurance of the young man's tone roused his would-be tormentor like a
personal affront.
"""You got away from Seattle, but there is a commissioner at Dutch"
"Harbor, also a deputy marshal, who may have better success with a"
"warrant than those policemen had."" The Trust's manager could not keep"
"down the angry tremor in his voice, and the other, perceiving it,"
replied in a manner designed to inflame him still more:
"""Yes, I have heard of those officers. I understand they are both in"
"his side, with relaxed, enormous limbs, on the hearth-rug, lifted his"
"massive head for a second and glanced at John. Then with a half-grunt,"
"half-sigh, he dropped his head, and twitched his limbs and went to sleep"
again.
"“Now and then when you 're not looking at me,” said Stellamaris, “there"
is a strange look in your eyes: it is when you 're not speaking and you
stare out of window without seeming to see anything.”
For a moment Risca was assailed by a temptation to break the Unwritten
"Law and tell her something of his misery. She, with her superfine"
"intelligence, would understand, and her sympathy would be sweet. But he"
put the temptation roughly from him.
"“I am the happiest fellow in the world, Stellamaris,” said he."
“It would be difficult not to be happy in such a world.”
She pointed out to sea. The blustering wind of the day before had
"fallen, and a light breeze shook the tips of the waves to the"
"morning sunshine, which turned them into diamonds. The sails of the"
fishing-fleet of the tiny port flashed merrily against the kindly blue.
On the horizon a great steamer was visible steaming up Channel. The
salt air came in through the open windows. The laughter of fishermen's
children rose faintly from the beach far below.
"“And there's spring, too, dancing over everything,” she said. “Don't you"
feel it?”
"He acknowledged the vernal influence, and, careful lest his eyes should"
"betray him, talked of the many things she loved. He had not seen her for"
"a fortnight, so there were the apocryphal doings of Lilias and Niphetos"
stream of hurrying vehicles in the avenue. The younger one cuddled down
with her head in her sister’s lap.
"“We will have to marry some day,” she said dreamily—“both of us. We"
have so much money that we will not be allowed to disappoint the
"public. Do you want me to tell you the kind of a man I could love,"
Sis?”
"“Go on, you scatterbrain,” smiled the other."
"“I could love a man with dark and kind blue eyes, who is gentle and"
"respectful to poor girls, who is handsome and good and does not try to"
"flirt. But I could love him only if he had an ambition, an object, some"
work to do in the world. I would not care how poor he was if I could
"help him build his way up. But, sister dear, the kind of man we always"
meet—the man who lives an idle life between society and his clubs—I
"could not love a man like that, even if his eyes were blue and he were"
ever so kind to poor girls whom he met in the street.”
BY COURIER
It was neither the season nor the hour when the Park had frequenters;
"and it is likely that the young lady, who was seated on one of the"
"benches at the side of the walk, had merely obeyed a sudden impulse to"
sit for a while and enjoy a foretaste of coming Spring.
"She rested there, pensive and still. A certain melancholy that touched"
"her countenance must have been of recent birth, for it had not yet"
"""I don't know,"" Sallie answered at random and since he seemed to expect"
"some reply to that fatuity. She had met a good many men in her time, but"
never one quite like this Lord Ingoldsby--who actually seemed anxious to
look and act like a cunning fool.
A waiter intervened between them. But his lordship waved that
functionary away.
"""Do let's,"" he implored with child-like insistence. ""It would be so"
"deevy to be pals with you. And I'm beastly dull here, all by myself,"
don't y'know. So--

"""No, I _don't_ want any oysters--I told that waiter-chap so. And I"
_don't_ know any 'lady of the camellias.' I can't imagine what you're
"talkin' about at all, I'm sure."""
"""I saw her again last night, at the Casino,"" said Slyne, imperturbably,"
and went on to entertain Sallie with a long if not over-truthful account
"of his own over-night's doings there. So that, for all his lordship's"
"lack of manners, it was some time before that spoiled youth again"
succeeded in monopolising her attention. At every turn Slyne was ready
"to balk him, and, but for his native self-conceit coupled with a certain"
"blind obstinacy, he must very soon have understood what was perfectly"
"plain to Sallie, that he was there merely on sufferance, to serve some"
purpose of Slyne's.

Slyne had turned to give a departing waiter some order.

eight years old. In our private life we always spoke Italian or

afterwards English--I speak and write all three equally well; which of

that great Devonshire seaport. I was young enough to absorb the rich
"English atmosphere, nowhere so rich as in that county which is the"
"home and breeding-ground of your most splendid Navy. I was born again,"
a young Elizabethan Englishman. My story to you of my origin was true
in one particular--I really was educated at Blundell's School at
Tiverton. Whenever--and it has happened more than once--I have met as
Trehayne old schoolfellows of Blundell's they have accepted without
"comment or inquiry my tale that I had become an Englishman, and had"
"anglicised my name. Among the peoples which exist on earth to-day, you"
English are the most nobly generous and unsuspicious. The Prussians

"The police launch sheered off, and the sound of her exhaust grew"
rapidly fainter and fainter. But not until it had wholly ceased did Big
George give over his post at the wheel. Even then he went down the
"ladder reluctantly, and without a word of thanks, of explanation, or of"
apology. With him this had been but a part of the day's work. He saw
neither sentiment nor humor in the episode. The clang of the
"deep-throated ship's bell spoke the hour, and, taking Cherry's arm,"
Boyd helped her to the deck.

"fog-bound harbor of Unalaska. The soaring ""goonies"" that had followed"
them from Flattery had dropped astern at first sight of the volcanic
"headlands, and now countless thousands of sea-parrots fled from the"
"ship's path, squattering away in comic terror, dragging their fat"
bodies across the sea as a boy skips a flat rock. It had been Captain
"Peasley's hope, here at the gateway of the Misty Sea, to learn"
"something about the lay of the big ice-floes to the northward, but he"
"was disappointed, for the season was yet too young for the"
"revenue-cutters, and the local hunters knew nothing. Forced to rely on"
"luck and his own skill, he steamed out again the next day, this time"
"""And I will take a stone and hit you on the head,"" the young man"
answered respectfully.
"Martyanoff would have broken his bones, had not Kuvalda interrupted"
with:
"""Leave him alone....  Is this a home to you or even to us? You have no"
sufficient reason to break his teeth for him.  You have no better
"reason than he for living with us."""
"""Well, then, Devil take him! ...  We all live in the world without"
"sufficient reason....  We live, and why?  Because!  He also because ..."
"let him alone...."""
"""But it is better for you, young man, to go away from us,"" the teacher"
"advised him, looking him up and down with his sad eyes. He made no"
"answer, but remained.  And they soon became accustomed to his presence,"
"and ceased to take any notice of him.  But he lived among them, and"
observed everything.
"The above were the chief members of the Captain's company, and he"

For though there were men who had experienced as much of the bitter
"irony of fate as these men, yet they were not fallen so low.  Not"
"infrequently, respectable men belonging to the cultured classes are"
"inferior to those belonging to the peasantry, and it is always a fact"
that the depraved man from the city is immeasurably worse than the
depraved man from the village.  This fact was strikingly illustrated by
the contrast between the formerly well-educated men and the mujiks who
were living in Kuvalda's shelter.
The representative of the latter class was an old mujik called Tyapa.
into the swifter current of the stream.
"“Jack wants to know can you spare him a few minutes, sir,” he explained."
“There’s a bit of trouble down below.”
"“What kind of trouble?” Bob asked swiftly, turning downstream without an"
instant’s delay; and walking by the side of the dynamite man.
"Calker scratched his head slowly. “I ain’t quite certain sure, Mr."
"Bainbridge,” he drawled, “but I got a idea there’s a fellow with a mill"
who’s run out a sortin’ boom that’s goin’ to hang up our drive if we
ain’t mighty keerful.”
"“A mill!” exclaimed Bob incredulously. “Why, there isn’t such a thing"
"within twenty miles--at least, there wasn’t three months ago.”"
Calker grinned. “Thought it looked kinda new. I couldn’t rightly say
"that it’s finished, but there ain’t no manner of a doubt about the boom."
"The jam had started before I come away, an’ I left Jack havin’ it hot"
an’ heavy with a red-headed son of a gun who sure looked as if scrap was
his middle name.”
"Bainbridge frowned, but asked no further questions. He scarcely spoke,"
"in fact, during all of the four miles, but it was evident to his"
observing companion that he was doing a lot of thinking.
Long before reaching the point of obstruction it became evident that
"another jam had formed. The current grew more and more sluggish, and the"
"progress of the logs downstream became slower and slower, until at"
length the entire surface of the water was covered with floating timber.
These in turn crowded upon one another with a rapidity which threatened
to equal that first jam unless something was swiftly done.
In practical agriculture my father was among Indians one of the first to
"start a tea industry in Assam, now regarded as one of the most"
flourishing. He gave practically everything in the starting of some
Weaving Mills. He stood by this and many other efforts in industrial
developments. The success of which I spoke did not come till long
after--too late for him to see it. He had come before the country was
"ready, and it happened to him as it must happen to all pioneers. Every"
one of his efforts failed and the crash came. And a great burden fell on
us which was only lifted by our united effects just before his work here
was over.
A failure? Yes but not ignoble or altogether futile. Since it was
through the witnessing of this struggle that the son learned to look on
"success or failure as one, to realise that some defeat was greater than"
"victory. And if my life in any way proved to be fruitful, then that came"
through the realisation of this lesson.
To me his life had been one of blessing and daily thanksgiving.
Nevertheless every one had said that he wrecked his life which was meant
for far greater things. Few realise that out of the skeletons of myriad
lives have been built vast continents. And it is on the wreck of a life
like his and of many such lives there will be built the Greater India
"yet to be. We do not know why it should be so, but we do know that the"
Earth Mother is hungry for sacrifice.

The work of exploring the planets that swung with Earth around the sun
"was still a new branch of the service. Less than ten years ago, it had"
"been, when Ansen devised his first crude atomic motor."
"At once, with the introduction of this tremendous new motive power,"
"men had begun to build space ships and explore the sky. And, as so"
"often happens with a new invention, the thing had grown rather beyond"
itself.
Everywhere amateur space flyers launched forth into the heavens to try
their new celestial wings. Everywhere young and old enthusiasts set
Ansen motors into clumsily insulated shells and started for Mars or
the moon or Venus.
"The resultant loss of life, as might have been foreseen, was"
appalling. Eager but inexperienced explorers edged over onto the wrong
side of Mercury and were burned to cinders. They set forth in ships
"that were badly insulated, and froze in the absolute zero of space."
"They learned the atomic motor controls too hastily, ran out of"
"supplies or lost their courses, and wandered far out into space--stiff"
corpses in coffins that were to be buried only in time's infinity.
"To stop the foolish waste of life, the Earth Government stepped in. It"
was decreed that no space ship might be owned or built privately. It
was further decreed that those who felt an urge to explore must join

"""But we must call a doctor at once,"" I urged.  ""If you have suspicion of"
"foul play we should surely know if there is any wound, or any injury to"
"account for death."""
"""I did not consider it necessary.  No doctor can return her to me,"" she"
"wailed.  ""I sent for you because I believed that you would render me"
"assistance in this terrible affair."""
"""Most certainly I will,"" I replied.  ""But in our own interests we must"
"send for a medical man, and if it is found to be actually a case of foul"
"play, for the police.  I'll send a line to Doctor Deane, an Englishman"
"whom I know, who is generally called in to see anybody at the Embassy"
"who chances to be ill.  He is a good fellow, and his discretion may be"
"relied upon."""
"So saying, I scribbled a line on the back of a card, and told the man to"
"take a cab down to the Rue du Havre, where the doctor occupied rooms"
over a hosier's shop a stone's throw from the bustling Gare St. Lazare.
A very curious mystery was evidently connected with this startling
"discovery, and I was anxious that my friend, Dick Deane, one of my old"
"chums of Rugby days, should assist me in clearing it up."
"The Countess de Foville, whose calmness had been so remarkable while"
"speaking with me before we entered the death-chamber, had now given way"
"to a flood of emotion.  She sank back into her chair, and, burying her"
"face in her hands, cried bitterly."
"I tried to obtain some further information from her, but all that"
escaped her was:
At this girl’s right hand sat a young man about twenty-four. He was
"well-built, active, strong-jawed and good-natured. But if his"
"description seems to follow that of James Williams, divest it of"
anything Cloverdalian. This man belonged to hard streets and sharp
"corners. He looked keenly about him, seeming to begrudge the asphalt"
under the feet of those upon whom he looked down from his perch.
"While the megaphone barks at a famous hostelry, let me whisper you"
through the low-tuned cardiaphone to sit tight; for now things are
"about to happen, and the great city will close over them again as over"
a scrap of ticker tape floating down from the den of a Broad street
bear.
The girl in the tan jacket twisted around to view the pilgrims on the
last seat. The other passengers she had absorbed; the seat behind her
was her Bluebeard’s chamber.
Her eyes met those of Mrs. James Williams. Between two ticks of a watch
"they exchanged their life’s experiences, histories, hopes and fancies."
"And all, mind you, with the eye, before two men could have decided"
whether to draw steel or borrow a match.
"The bride leaned forward low. She and the girl spoke rapidly together,"
their tongues moving quickly like those of two serpents—a comparison
that is not meant to go further. Two smiles and a dozen nods closed the
conference.
"And now in the broad, quiet avenue in front of the Rubberneck car a man"
in dark clothes stood with uplifted hand. From the sidewalk another
hurried to join him.

"writing a letter even, they never think of it.”"

"spotlessly clean, the orphans sluiced and scrubbed from morning to"
night; but of things that might give a little hint of the joy of life
there was no sign.

door-knob.
"“I should like to see it,” said John."
"They entered. An almost full-grown orphan, doing duty as nurse, rose"
"from her task of plain sewing and bobbed a curtsy. The room was clean,"
"comfortless, dark, and cold. Two pictures, prints of the Crucifixion"
"and the Martyrdom of St. Stephen, hung on the walls. There were three"
"narrow, hard beds, two of which were occupied. Some grapes on a chair"
beside one of them marked the patient in whom he was interested. John
noticed angrily that some flowers which he had sent the day before had
been confiscated.
"“This is the gentleman who has been so kind to you,” said the matron."
"Unity Blake looked wonderingly into the dark, rugged face of the man who"
stood over her and regarded her with mingled pain and pity. They had not
"told her his name. This, then, was the unknown benefactor whose image,"

her poor dreams.

PREFACE
"This book was written in 1915, for the amusement of my wife and myself"
at a time when life was not very amusing; it was published at the end
"of 1917; was reviewed, if at all, as one of a parcel, by some brisk"
"uncle from the Tiny Tots Department; and died quietly, without"
seriously detracting from the interest which was being taken in the
"World War, then in progress."
It may be that the circumstances in which the book was written have
"made me unduly fond of it.  When, as sometimes happens, I am"
introduced to a stranger who starts the conversation on the right
"lines by praising, however insincerely, my books, I always say, ""But"
"you have not read the best one."" Nine times out of ten it is so.  The"
"tenth takes a place in the family calendar; St. Michael or St. Agatha,"
"as the case may be, a red-letter or black-letter saint, according to"
whether the book was bought or borrowed.  But there are few such
"saints, and both my publisher and I have the feeling (so common to"
publishers and authors) that there ought to be more.  So here comes
"the book again, in a new dress, with new decorations, yet much, as far"
"as I am concerned, the same book, making the same appeal to me; but,"
"let us hope, a new appeal, this time, to others."
"For whom, then, is the book intended?  That is the trouble.  Unless I"
"can say, ""For those, young or old, who like the things which I like,"""
"I find it difficult to answer.  Is it a children's book?  Well, what"
do we mean by that?  Is _The Wind in the Willows_ a children's book?

"Occasionally he had landed--always staying close to the space ship,"
"for Jupiter's gravity made movement a slow and laborious process, and"
he didn't want to be caught too far from security. At such times he
might hear a crashing and splashing and see a reptilian head loom
gigantically at him through the fog. Then he would discharge the
"deadly explosive gun which was Earth's latest weapon, and the creature"
would crash to the ground. The chorus of hissings and bellowings would
"increase as he hastened slowly and laboriously back to the ship,"
indicating that other unseen monsters of the steamy jungle had flocked
to tear the dead giant to pieces and bolt it down.
"Oh, Jupiter was a nice planet! mused Brand. A sweet place--if one"

"He had always thought the entire globe was in that new, raw, marshy"
state. But he had worked only in one comparatively small area of the
northern hemisphere; had never been within thirty thousand miles of
"the red spot. What might lie in that ominous crimson patch, he could"
"not even guess. However, he reflected, he was soon to find out, though"
he might never live to tell about it.
"Shrugging his shoulders, he turned into the fifty story building in"
"which was his modest apartment. There he found, written by the"
"automatic stylus on his radio pad, the message: ""Be with you at seven"
"o'clock. Best regards, and I hope you strangle. Dex Harlow."""

"The letter continued, “I am happy to say, however, that I have a"
prophylactic which will destroy any number of these germs if used up to
the ninth day. It is necessary only that you should place five thousand
dollars in an envelope and leave it for me to be called for at the desk
"of the Prince Henry Hotel. When the messenger delivers the money to me,"
the prophylactic will be sent immediately.
"“First of all, take a match and burn this letter to avoid spreading the"
disease. Then change your clothes and burn the old ones. Enclosed you
will find in a germ-proof envelope an exact copy of this letter. The
room should then be thoroughly fumigated. Do not come into close
contact with anyone near and dear to you until you have used the
"prophylactic. Tell no one. In case you do, the prophylactic will not be"
"sent under any circumstances. Very truly yours, DR. HANS HOPF.”"
"“Blackmail!” exclaimed Kennedy, looking intently again at the gelatine"
"on the second page, as I involuntarily backed away and held my breath."
"“Yes, I know,” responded Mrs. Blake anxiously, “but is it true?”"
There could be no doubt from the tone of her voice that she more than
half believed that it was true.
"“I cannot say—yet,” replied Craig, still cautiously scanning the"
apparently innocent piece of gelatine on the original letter which Mrs.
Blake had not destroyed. “I shall have to keep it and examine it.”
On the gelatine I could see a dark mass which evidently was supposed to
contain the germs.

result half so well as this encounter with the tools of the Lumber

thought the young lumberman. His meditation was broken in upon by the
sound of a strange voice.
“I had no idea lumbering was such a strenuous occupation.”
"A moment later Bainbridge was looking into a pair of pleasant, friendly"
eyes set in the handsome face of a man of about fifty. He was roughly
"dressed in well-worn, but finely made fishing clothes, and carried a"
"good trout rod in one hand. There was, too, about the stranger an air of"
forceful capability which attracted the younger man.
"“It’s not usually quite so full of incident,” said Bob; “but I don’t"
believe you’d ever find it exactly tame.”
"The stranger smiled, and made a comprehensive gesture with his hands."
"“And this is your idea of incident,” he murmured whimsically. “I should"
call it something decidedly stronger.”
"He hesitated for an instant, then moved closer to Bob."
"“You’re going downstream, aren’t you? Do you mind if I walk along with"
you? My camp’s down that way.”
Bainbridge acquiesced readily. There was something very taking about the
"stranger, and within ten minutes he found himself chatting as if to an"
"old friend. His companion turned out to be Wolcott Sears, of Boston, on"
a two weeks’ trip in the Maine woods. The name was only vaguely
"familiar, but Bob felt sure from his manner that he was a man of"
affairs. He was tremendously interested in hearing all about the
The officer hesitated. In such circumstances one might easily do wrong.
"He might shoot these men, and after all find that they were innocent. He"
preferred to wait. The living are more easily deprived of life than the
dead restored to it. Such was his thought.
In any case he had not long to wait.
"Round the angle of the mill-house swept the general and his staff,"
"brilliant in scarlet and white, heightened by the glitter of abundant"
"gold-lace. For the ex-butcher of Tortosa was a kind of military dandy,"
and loved to surround himself with the foppery of the _matador_ and the
"brigand. At heart, indeed, he was still the _guerrillero_ of Morella,"
riding home through the streets of that little rebel city after a
successful foray.
As his eyes fell on the row of men dark against the dusty _adobe_ of the
"garden wall, and on the two pale women, a dark frown overspread his"
face.
"""What is the meaning of this?"" he cried. ""Why have you not obeyed your"
"instructions? Why are these men not yet dead?"""
"The officer trembled, and began an explanation, pointing to Concha and"
"La Giralda, both of whom stood for a moment motionless. Then flinging"
herself over the low wall of the garden as if her years had more nearly
"approached seventeen than seventy, La Giralda caught the great man by"
the stirrup.
"""Little Ramon, Ramon Cabrera,"" she cried, ""have you forgotten your old"
"nurse, La Giralda of Sevilla, your mother's gossip, your own playmate?"""
"The general turned full upon her, with the quick indignant threat of one"
"pomp of the alluring pompadour. She wore no chains, bracelets or"
lockets. She had not the air of being about to accept an invitation to
"luncheon. Her dress was grey and plain, but it fitted her figure with"
fidelity and discretion. In her neat black turban hat was the
gold-green wing of a macaw. On this morning she was softly and shyly
"radiant. Her eyes were dreamily bright, her cheeks genuine peachblow,"
"her expression a happy one, tinged with reminiscence."
"Pitcher, still mildly curious, noticed a difference in her ways this"
"morning. Instead of going straight into the adjoining room, where her"
"desk was, she lingered, slightly irresolute, in the outer office. Once"
"she moved over by Maxwell’s desk, near enough for him to be aware of"
her presence.
The machine sitting at that desk was no longer a man; it was a busy New
"York broker, moved by buzzing wheels and uncoiling springs."
“Well—what is it? Anything?” asked Maxwell sharply. His opened mail lay
"like a bank of stage snow on his crowded desk. His keen grey eye,"
"impersonal and brusque, flashed upon her half impatiently."
"“Nothing,” answered the stenographer, moving away with a little smile."
"“Mr. Pitcher,” she said to the confidential clerk, “did Mr. Maxwell say"
anything yesterday about engaging another stenographer?”
"“He did,” answered Pitcher. “He told me to get another one. I notified"
the agency yesterday afternoon to send over a few samples this morning.
"It’s 9.45 o’clock, and not a single picture hat or piece of pineapple"
chewing gum has showed up yet.”
"“I will do the work as usual, then,” said the young lady, “until some"
which penetrated the sheltering walls out into the night where fifty
men writhed in a death-struggle with hundreds--saw every bleeding
"wound, heard every smothered moan of pain, felt already the cold iron"
"pierce their own breasts. The hours passed, and they did not yield."
"They had ceased from their incongruous tasks, and stood and waited,"
wordless and tearless.
As the first grey lights of dawn crept into the stifling room they
"heard footsteps hurrying across the adjacent room, and each drew"
herself upright to meet the end. Mrs. Carmichael's hand tightened over
"the revolver, but it was only Mr. Berry who entered. The little"
"missionary, a shy, society-shunning man, noted for doing more harm"
than good among the natives by his zealous bigotry and ignorance of
"their prejudices, stood revealed in a new light. His face was grimed"
"with dirt and powder, his clothes disordered, his weak eyes bright"
with the fire of battle.
"""Do not be afraid,"" he said quickly. ""There is no immediate danger. I"
have only been sent to warn you to be ready to leave the bungalow. The
"front wall is shot-riddled, and the place may become indefensible at"
"any moment. When that time comes, you must slip out to the old"
"bungalow. Nicholson believes he can hold out there."""
"""My husband--?"" interrupted Mrs. Carmichael."
"""Your husband is safe. In fact, all three were well when I left. If I"
"wasn't against such things, I should say it was a splendid fight--and"
"every man a hero. The Rajah--"""
"""The Rajah--?"""
Mr. Berry looked in stern surprise at the pale face of the speaker.
and was smitten in turn by the beak of Francesco's shield.
"Again Francesco rushed Raniero to the wall, leaped back and got in his"
"blow. Raniero's face was a red blur. He dropped his shield, put both"
"his hands to his sword and swung great blows at Francesco, with the"
huge rage of a desperate and tiring man. Francesco led him up and down
"the hall. Raniero's breath came in gasps, and his strength began to"
wane.
"Francesco bided his chance and seized it. He ran in, after Raniero had"
"missed him with one of his savage sweeping blows, and rushed him"
"against the wall. Then he struck and struck again, without uttering a"
"word, playing so fast upon Raniero that he had his man smothered,"
blundering and dazed. The end came with a blow that cut the crown of
"Raniero's helmet. He threw up his hands with a spasmodic gesture,"
"lurched forward, fell, rolled over on his back and lay still."
"For a moment Francesco stood over him, the point of his sword on"
Raniero's throat. He seemed to waver; then all the misery the
Frangipani had inflicted on Ilaria rushed over him as in a blinding
cloud.
"His sword went home. A strange cry passed through the hall, then all"
was still. The torch spluttered once more and went out. Francesco was
in the darkness beside the dead body of Raniero.--
Meanwhile the Pisans had succeeded in scaling the walls. The clamor of
"the fight grew less and less, as one by one the defenders of Astura"
were relentlessly struck down and hurled over the ramparts. The storm
"had increased in violence, the heavens were cataracts of fire.--"
In the blood-drenched court the duke and the Pisan admiral shook
Mr. Jobling sank still lower in his seat.
"""In return for that,"" Slyne went on, ""he must sign a clear deliverance"
"from any further claim on any of us, subject, of course, to due payment"
of the note.
"""Then, I want a document drawn up to confirm my engagement to the girl"
and granting me the fullest possible power of attorney on her behalf
both before and after our marriage. She's so simple and inexperienced
that I must do everything for her.
"""And, lastly, you'd better make out a brief private agreement between"
"yourself and me--just as a matter of form, you know--to the effect that"
"you are willing to act in my interests throughout, in return for a"
commission of ten per cent. on the accumulated revenues of the Jura
"estates at the date of my marriage."""
Mr. Jobling looked at him for a time as a man suddenly bereft of his
spine might.
"""There's no time to spare,"" Slyne mentioned. ""I want all that sort of"
thing settled right off the reel--before lunch.
"""If the old man makes any kick about anything, you must back me up in"
all I say. Although if he tries to raise his price by a few thousand
"dollars, we needn't stick at that. The great thing is to get him to sign"
"the deliverance in return for our note. The girl has already agreed--"""
"""And what if _I_ refuse?"" croaked his companion with the courage of"
desperation. It was evident that Mr. Jobling saw through his daring
"scheme. ""What if I insist on my fair share? What if I--"""
lacked the strength that was needed to run counter to all. I was no
"knight-errant, but a plain man, and I reeled on through the last hour"
"of the night and the first grey streaks of dawn, with my head on my"
breast and sobs of despair in my throat.

"city, I do not think that I could have gone through with it. Doubtless"
it was my duty to go with my lady. But the long hours of daylight
"inaction, the slow brooding tramp, must have proved intolerable. And"
"at some time or other, in some way or other, I must have snapped the"
ties that bound me.
"But, as if the loss of my heart had rid us of some spell cast over us,"
"by noon of that day we stood safe. For, an hour before noon, while we"
"lay in a fir-wood not far from Weimar, and Jacob kept watch on the"
"road below, and the rest slept as we pleased, a party of horse came"
"along the way, and made as if to pass below us. They numbered more"
"than a hundred, and Jacob's heart failed him, lest some ring or buckle"
of our accoutrements should sparkle and catch their eyes. To shift the
"burden he called us, and we went to watch them."
'Do they go north or south?' I asked him as I rose.
"I took down the address, but I was most ungracious to Eilert. Why couldn't"
he have kept the other knapsack--why this particular one?
Eilert replied that it was true the gentleman had offered him the other
"one, but he could see from the outside that it was not so good as this"
one. And I should remember that the money the missis had paid him hadn't
covered more than the bill for one of them. So it was only reasonable that
"he should take the fullest knapsack. As a matter of fact, he had behaved"
"very well, and that was the truth. Because when she gave him the larger"
"knapsack, and wrote the address, she had scolded, but he had kept quiet,"
"and said not another word. And anyway, nobody had better try it on"
"him--they'd better not, or he'd know the reason why!"
Eilert shook a long-armed fist at the sky.
"When he had eaten, drunk his coffee, and rested for a while, he was not so"
lively and talkative as on the previous day. He had been brooding and
"speculating ever since last summer, when the motor traffic started, and"
"did I think it would be a good idea for him to hire three grown men, too,"
and build a much bigger house than Olaus's?
"So he had caught it, too--the great, modern Norwegian disease!"
"The knapsack was back in her room again; yes, these were her clothes; I"
"recognized her blouses, her skirts and her shoes. I hardly looked at them,"
"of course; just unpacked them, folded them neatly, and put them back in"
the bag again; because no doubt Eilert had had them all out in a heap.
This was really my only reason for unpacking them.
finger-bowls.
The name of the other waitress was Tildy. Why do you suggest Matilda?
"Please listen this time—Tildy—Tildy. Tildy was dumpy, plain-faced, and"
too anxious to please to please. Repeat the last clause to yourself
"once or twice, and make the acquaintance of the duplicate infinite."
"The Voice at Bogle’s was invisible. It came from the kitchen, and did"
"not shine in the way of originality. It was a heathen Voice, and"
contented itself with vain repetitions of exclamations emitted by the
waitresses concerning food.
Will it tire you to be told again that Aileen was beautiful? Had she
donned a few hundred dollars’ worth of clothes and joined the Easter
"parade, and had you seen her, you would have hastened to say so"
yourself.
The customers at Bogle’s were her slaves. Six tables full she could
wait upon at once. They who were in a hurry restrained their impatience
"for the joy of merely gazing upon her swiftly moving, graceful figure."
They who had finished eating ate more that they might continue in the
light of her smiles. Every man there—and they were mostly men—tried to
make his impression upon her.
Aileen could successfully exchange repartee against a dozen at once.
"And every smile that she sent forth lodged, like pellets from a"
"scatter-gun, in as many hearts. And all this while she would be"
"performing astounding feats with orders of pork and beans, pot roasts,"
"ham-and, sausage-and-the-wheats, and any quantity of things on the iron"
and in the pan and straight up and on the side. With all this feasting
and flirting and merry exchange of wit Bogle’s came mighty near being a
"salon, with Aileen for its Madame Récamier."
vulgarly self-assertive. Be righteous. Let your words and deeds
correspond. Lead no double life. Proclaim what you think right.
IDEAL OF KINGSHIP
The Indian ideal of kingship will be clear to you if I recite the
invocation with which we crowned our kings from the Vedic Times:
"""Be with us. We have chosen thee"
Let all the people wish for thee
Stand steadfast and immovable
Be like a mountain unremoved
"And hold thy kingship in thy grasp."""
"We have chosen thee, our prayers have consecrated thee, for all the"
wishes of the people went with thee. Thou art to stand as mountain
"unremoved, for thy throne is planted secure on the hearts of thy people."
"Stand steadfast then, for we have endowed thee with power irresistible."
Fall therefore not away; but let thy sceptre be held firmly in thy
grasp.
"Which is more potent, Matter or Spirit? Is the power with which the"
people endow their king identical with the power of wealth with which we
enrich him by paying him his Royal dues? We make him irresistible not by
"wealth but by the strength of our lives, the strength of our mind, may,"
"we have to pay him more according to our ancient Lawgivers, in as much"
"as the eighth part of our deeds and virtues, and the merit we have"
ourselves acquired. We can only make him irresistible by the strength of
"our lives, the strength of our minds, and the strength that comes out of"
righteousness.
"Slyne was not beyond feeling somewhat ashamed of himself, but found easy"
solace in the reflection that all he had said was for her good as well
as his own. He could see that his last brutal argument had struck home.
"For Sallie could no longer doubt, now, in the lurid light of her recent"
"experiences, that Captain Dove looked upon her as a mere chattel, to be"
turned into cash as soon as occasion should offer.
"In a little she looked up at him again out of pleading, desperate eyes."
Some most unusual impulse of pity stirred him. She was only a young girl
"yet, and her helplessness spoke its own appeal, even to him. He made up"
"his mind again, quite apart from any question of policy, to deal with"
her as generously as might be practicable.
"""Will Captain Dove let me go now if I promise to marry you, Jasper?"" she"
asked. And he nodded solemnly.
"""And not unless I do?"" she insisted. ""You _know_ I didn't--before,"
"although you say I did."""
"""I swear to God, Sallie,"" he declared, ""that I can't raise the money the"
Old Man wants any other way. And--I won't say another word about what's
past and done with.
"""If you'll really promise to marry me,"" he said eagerly, ""I'll prove to"
you that all I have told you is true before you need even leave Captain
Dove; I won't ask you to go a step farther with me until you're
perfectly satisfied; I'll take you safely to your own home as soon as
you _are_ satisfied that you can trust me. And I won't ask you to keep
"your promise till--"""
An irrepressible light of longing had leaped up behind the despair in
her eyes.
other girls who were going to Venus for husbands talked to each other
"during the lecture, but not _my_ sister! She hung on every word, took"
"notes even, and asked enough questions to make the perspiring purser"
really work in those orientation periods.
"""I am very sorry, Miss Sparling,"" he said with pretty heavy sarcasm,"
"""but I cannot remember any of the agricultural products of the Macro"
Continent. Since the human population is well below one per thousand
"square miles, it can readily be understood that the quantity of"
"tilled soil, land or sub-surface, is so small that--Wait, I remember"
something. The Macro Continent exports a fruit though not exactly an
edible one. The wild _dunging_ drug is harvested there by criminal
"speculators. Contrary to belief on Earth, the traffic has been growing"
"in recent years. In fact--"""
"""Pardon me, sir,"" I broke in, ""but doesn't _dunging_ come only from"
Leif Erickson Island off the Moscow Peninsula of the Macro Continent?
"You remember, purser--Wang Li's third exploration, where he proved the"
"island and the peninsula didn't meet for most of the year?"""
"The purser nodded slowly. ""I forgot,"" he admitted. ""Sorry, ladies, but"
"the boy's right. Please make the correction in your notes."""
"But Sis was the only one who took notes, and she didn't take that one."
"She stared at me for a moment, biting her lower lip thoughtfully, while"
I got sicker and sicker. Then she shut her pad with the final gesture
of the right hand that Mom used to use just before challenging the
opposition to come right down on the Council floor and debate it out
with her.
"""Ferdinand,"" Sis said, ""let's go back to our cabin."""
Something was wrong. The shelling of the back-areas continued; air-raids
became more and more frequent. These were ominous signs.
Then the newspapers arrived. The Somme front had collapsed. The Fifth
Army was in full retreat. The Germans had taken Bapaume and Peronne and
were threatening Amiens.

Had I been living in Germany during the war I would have felt a powerful
"tendency to defend the cause of the Allies, to excuse their misdeeds, to"
"overrate their ability, while being highly critical and censorious of"
every German shortcoming.
"A nation at war is a mob whose very blatancy, injustice and cruelty"
drive one to hatred and opposition. The enemy mob seems less detestable
"because it is out of sight and one thinks almost involuntarily: ""It"
"cannot be as bad as our own."""
I could not bear to hear a victory joyfully announced. The jubilation
"and the self-glorification of the crowd filled me with loathing, and I"
could only think of the intensified slaughter and misery that are the
"price of every victory. They who pay the price, they alone have the"
"right to rejoice, but they do not rejoice. The German mob revealed its"
depravity when it hung out flags in the streets to celebrate the first
"German victories. And, when the first battle of Cambrai was won, London"
jeered at the bereaved and mocked the dead by ringing the joy-bells.
Every genuine patriot is called a traitor in his own country. But
"patriotism, however genuine, is a thing that must be surmounted. There"
"is only one good that war can bring to a nation--defeat. A patriot,"
"loving his own country, would therefore wish his country defeat in war."
"to Slyne's; both of whom met it without winking, although Captain Dove"
was no doubt glad of the protection of his smoked glasses.
"""I'll have to go through the proofs, of course,"" said his lordship"
"reflectively and let his gaze rest on Sallie again. ""But--if"
"everything's as you say, I don't think it will be long before Lady"
Josceline finds herself in full enjoyment of all her rights and
"privileges. If everything's as you say, I'll do whatever lies in my"
power to expedite matters; I think I can promise you that the case will
"be called immediately the vacation is over. Meanwhile, however, and till"
"I have looked through the proofs, I can make no further order."""
"He rose, and they also got up from their chairs as he came round from"
"behind his desk and confronted Sallie, a tall, stooping old man with a"
wrinkled face and tired but kindly eyes.
"She looked up into them frankly, and he laid a hand on her shoulder."
"""Yours has been a very sad history so far, my dear young lady,"" he said,"
"his head on one side, still studying her. ""I hope it will be all the"
brighter henceforth. I knew--the last Earl of Jura--when we were both
"young men--before he married. You remind me of him, as he was then, in"
"many respects. Good day to you now; my time here is not my own, you"
"know. But some day, perhaps you will allow me to pay my respects to"
"you--at Justicehall, since we're to be neighbours; my own home isn't"
"very far from yours."""
"Outside in the corridor, Mr. Jobling shook hands rapturously with every"
"one, even with Captain Dove."
"""We've turned the trick already,"" he declared. ""You heard what his"
"lordship said. With him on our side, the whole thing's as good as"
had marvellously recovered from his over-night's nervous break-down. A
"sound sleep, a visit from the barber, a bath and a liberal breakfast had"
all helped to alter him outwardly and inwardly for the better. He was
"once more the respectably prosperous, self-confident solicitor."
"""I believe you've been out all night,"" he observed in a jocular tone of"
"reproof, a waggish forefinger uplifted."
"""I've covered a couple of hundred miles in the car while you've been"
"asleep,"" answered Slyne, turning into his dressing-room. ""I've brought"
"the girl back with me--and the old man, her guardian. We're going to"
"have trouble with him unless we're very careful. So listen, and I'll"
"tell you how things stand."""
"Mr. Jobling composed his features into their most professional aspect,"
"but that gave place by degrees to a variety of other expressions, while"
"Slyne, busy changing his clothes, related all he himself knew as to"
Sallie's past history.
"""And now the old man thinks he is entitled to put a price on her,"" Slyne"
"concluded. ""She's promised to marry me, but he won't let her go till I"
"hand him a hundred thousand dollars."""
Mr. Jobling lay back limply in his chair. In all his career he had
"never, he asserted, heard a more scandalous suggestion."
"""Never mind about that,"" Slyne cut him short. ""The money's no object to"
me. But you can understand what a difficult fellow he is to deal with.
"And what I'm going to do, merely as a precaution against his playing us"
"false in the end, is to give him my note of hand for the amount he"
"demands, endorsed by you, and payable the day I marry his adopted"
"daughter."""
that bombing-stunt a few months ago. It was bloody awful too--the worst
thing I've ever been in. I was standing next to him when the first one
"exploded. He flopped down and lay flat on the ground, but I rushed away"
into the fields with a lot of others. When it was all over we went back
and heard the wounded crying out in a way that was dreadful to hear.
"This fellow was still lying on the ground by the duckboards, trembling"
"all over and paralysed with fear. We went to help the wounded, but he"
"was in such a state that he could not come with us, so we left him"
behind. There was an inquiry afterwards and _we_ got into a frightful
"row for running away. He got the M.M. for sticking to his post!"""
VII
THE GERMAN PUSH
"""What madness there is in this arithmetic that counts men by the"
millions like grains of corn in a bushel.... A newspaper has just
written about an encounter with the enemy: 'Our losses were
"insignificant, one dead and five wounded.' It would be interesting"
to know for whom these losses are insignificant? For the one who
"was killed?... If he were to rise from his grave, would he think"
the loss 'insignificant'? If only he could think of everything from
"the very beginning, of his childhood, his family, his beloved wife,"
"and how he went to the war and how, seized by the most conflicting"
"thoughts and emotions, he felt afraid, and how it all ended in"
death and horror.... But they try to convince us that 'our losses
"are insignificant.' Think of it, godless writer! Go to your master"
the Devil with your clever arithmetic.... How this man revolts
The late-night security team had listened sympathetically. They had no
objection if Androv wanted to roll a stair-truck under the fuselage of
"_Daedalus /, _then climb into the underbay and inspect turbo pumps in"
"the dead of night. Everybody knew he was eccentric. No, make that"
insane. You'd have to be to want to ride a rocket. They'd just waved
"him in. After all, the classified avionics in the forward bays were"
secured.
He smiled grimly to think that he'd been absolutely right. Hangar
Control was getting lax about security in these waning days before the
big test. It always happened after a few months of mechanics trooping
in and out.
That also explained why he now had a full set of magnetic access cards
"for all the sealed forward bays. Just as he'd figured, the mechanics"
were now leaving them stuffed in the pockets of the coveralls they kept
in their lockers in the changing room.
Time to get started.
"There was, naturally, double security, with a massive airlock port"
"opening onto a pressure bay, where three more secure ports sealed the"
"avionics bays themselves. The airlock port was like an airplane door,"
"double reinforced to withstand the near vacuum of space, and in the"
center was a green metallic slot for a magnetic card.
"He began trying cards, slipping them into the slot. The first, the"
"second, the third, the fourth, and then, payoff. The three green diodes"
above the lock handle flashed.
"He quickly shoved down the grip and pushed. The door eased inward, then"
"rotated to the side, opening onto the pressure bay."
"theirs. They suspect me of being a spy in German pay. Besides, your"
"von Bissing has ordered now that all Belgian, British, and French"
wounded shall be taken to the German Red Cross. Well: if you want
"to be kind, give me an introduction there. Surely it would be bare"
humanity on your part to let an Englishwoman be with some of those
"poor lads who are sorely wounded, dying perhaps""--she broke"
"down--""The other day I followed two of the motor ambulances along"
"the Boulevard d'Anspach. Blood dripped from them as they passed, and"
"I could hear some English boy trying to sing 'Tipperary--'"""
"""My _tear_ Miss Warren--I will try to do all that you want--You will"
"not do _anything I_ want, but never mind. I will show you that"
Germans can be generous. I will speak about your mother. I am sorry
that there are bad-mannered Germans in the hotel. There are
"some--what-you-call 'bounders'--among us, as there are with you. It"
"is to be regretted. As to our Red Cross hospitals, I know of a"
person who can make things easy for you. I will write a letter to my
cousin--like me she is a Saxon and comes from Leipzig--Minna von
"Stachelberg. She is but a few months widow, widow of a Saxon"
"officer, Graf von Stachelberg who was killed at Namur. Oh! it was"
very sad; they were but six months married. Afterwards she came here
"to work in our Red Cross--I think now she is in charge of a ward..."""
So Vivie found a few months' reprieve from acute sorrow and bitter
humiliation. Gräfin von Stachelberg was as kind in her way as her
"cousin the Colonel, but much less sentimental. In fact she was of"
"that type of New German woman, taken all too little into account by"
our Press at the time of the War. There were many like her of the
"upper middle class, the professorial class, the lesser nobility to"
"be found not only in Leipzig but in Berlin, Hamburg, Frankfort,"
"Halle, Bonn, München, Hannover, Bremen, Jena, Stuttgart,"
"Cologne--nice to look at, extremely modern in education and good"
was simply the train of thought aroused which struck Bainbridge
unpleasantly. He felt Schaeffer to be capable of almost any villainy
provided it could be accomplished with safety to himself. The
"humiliation of that fight, too, had added a powerful incentive to the"
one already offered by Crane and the Lumber Trust for the eclipse of Bob
Bainbridge. And a total eclipse would be so easy! Just a single shot
fired from the bushes at a moment when there was no one else about to
see or hear. In this wild country the chances of escaping were infinite.
The man might not even be suspected.
"Bob suddenly moved his shoulders impatiently, frowned, and turned away."
A moment later his eyes twinkled mirthfully.
"“Another minute and I’d have the undertaker picked out,” he chuckled."
"“The scoundrel hasn’t the common courage to do murder. All the same,” he"
"added, with a decisive squaring of the shoulders, “I’ll put a crimp in"
"his little game about those records. I’ll have cookee scrape ’em all up,"
"and ship the whole bunch down to John. That clerk, Wiggins, can put ’em"
"together, I’ll bet! Patience is his middle name--patience and picture"
"puzzles. We’ll have the laugh on Pete, after all--hanged if we won’t!”"
CHAPTER IX. IN THE SWIFT CURRENT
"The clumsy, slow-moving scow loaded with the cook’s outfit and a supply"
"of bedding followed the drive downstream, and, that night, fastened up"
"to the bank close to the inlet of Deer Pond, the middle one of three"
small bodies of water strung along the length of the Megantic. It was a
"full day’s work, much better than Bainbridge had hoped for, and, as he"
approached the big drying fire flaming up at one side of the camp made
"by Charlie Hanley, the cook, Bob shook his own hand in silent, grinning"
self-congratulation. He knew that they were far from being out of the
disturbances Captain Peasley made his way shoreward from the ship to
"scan the scene, and the sight of his uniform excited the ire of the"
"strikers afresh. After a glance over the mob, he remarked to Emerson:"
"""Bli'me! It looks like a bloody riot already, doesn't it? Four hundred"
pounds to those dock wallopers! Huh! You know if I allowed them to
"bleed me that way--"""
"At that instant, from some quarter, a railroad spike whizzed past the"
"Captain's head, banging against the boards behind him with such a thump"
that the dignified Englishman ducked quickly amid a shout of derision.
He began to curse them roundly in his own particular style.
"""You'd better keep under cover, Captain,"" advised Emerson. ""They don't"
"seem to care for you."""
"""So it would appear,"" he agreed. ""They're getting nawsty, aren't they?"
"I hope it doesn't lawst."""
"""Well, I hope it does,"" said George Balt. ""If they'll only keep at it"
and beat up some of our boys at quitting-time the whole gang will be
"here in the morning."""
"It seemed that his wishes bade fair to be realized, for, as the day"
"wore on, instead of diminishing, the excitement increased. By evening"
it became so menacing that Boyd was forced to send in an urgent demand
"for a squadron of bluecoats to escort his men to their lodgings, and it"
was only by the most vigorous efforts that a serious clash was averted.
Nor was this task the easier since it did not meet with the approval of
"the fishermen themselves, who keenly resented protection of any sort."
"True to George's prediction, the next morning found the non union men"
"The cooks served out the greasy stew as quickly as they could, but we"
were so tired and ill-tempered that we shouted abuse at them without
"reason and without being provoked, and banged our plates and tins. The"
"war, the advance, the slaughter were forgotten. We were conscious of"
"nothing but weariness, stiffness, and petty irritation."
The following day we marched to a ration dump. The wooden cases of
"rations were piled up in gigantic cubes, so that the entire dump looked"
"like a town of windowless, wooden buildings. We formed one long file"
"that circled slowly past the stacks, each man taking one case on to his"
shoulder or back and carrying it to the train. And so we circled round
and round throughout the monotonous day.
"In the evening I did not wait in the dinner queue, but went to the St."
Martin. It was kept by an old woman and her two daughters. They were
tortured by anxiety:
"""Les Allemands vont venir ici--de Shermans come heer?"" they asked. But I"
"knew no more than they did. I told them, against my own conviction, that"
"the German advance would be held up, but they remained anxious. The"
uproar of the cannonade was louder than ever. All the windows of the
"building shook and rattled. The old woman muttered: ""'Tis niet goet,"
"'tis niet goet,"" and the elder daughter echoed: ""Oh, 'tiss no bon, 'tiss"
"no bon."""
Two British officers entered. They looked round and saw that private
soldiers were sitting at the tables. But the St. Martin was the biggest
"estaminet in the village and provided the best wines and coffees, so"
"they stood in the doorway, undecided what to do. They asked one of the"
girls if there was a restaurant for officers in the neighbourhood. She
"answered: ""No--no restaurant for officeerss--you come heer--privates,"
"zey no hurt you--privates, officeerss, all same."""
"""I will promise if you wish, madame, that no word shall pass my lips,"" I"
"said.  ""But as to assistance, I cannot promise until I am aware of the"
"nature of the service demanded of me."""
"""Of course,"" she exclaimed, with a faint attempt at a smile.  My words"
"had apparently reassured her, for she instantly became calmer, as though"
"relying upon me for help.  ""Then as you give me your promise upon your"
"honour to say nothing, you shall know the truth.  Come with me."""
"She led the way down the long corridor, and turning to the left suddenly"
"opened the door of a large and handsome bed-chamber, the wooden"
sun-blinds of which were closed to keep out the crimson glow of the
sunset.  The room was a fine one with big crystal mirrors and a shining
"toilette-service in silver, but upon the bed with its yellow silk"
"hangings lay a female form fully dressed, but white-faced and"
motionless.  In the dim half-light I could just distinguish the features
as those of Yolande.
"""What has occurred?""  I cried in a hoarse whisper, dashing towards the"
bedside and bending down to look upon the face that had once held me in
fascination.
"""We do not know,"" answered the trembling woman at my side.  ""It is all a"
"mystery."""
I stretched forth my hand and touched her cheek.  It was icy cold.
In those few moments my eyes had become accustomed to the dim light of
"the darkened room, and I detected the change that had taken place in the"
"girl's countenance.  Her eyes were closed, her lips blanched, her fair"
"hair, escaped from its pins, fell in a sheen of gold upon the lace-edged"
thought; and he sent his light craft spinning rapidly up the stream as
the questions formed themselves.
It was an exquisite summer morning.  The bells in the many towers and
steeples of the city had chimed the hour of five.  The sun had long been
"up, yet the glamour and glory of the new-born day still lay upon the"
sleeping city and the dewy meadows of the opposite shore.  Grey rowed on
"rapidly, yet drinking in the beauty of all he saw.  He knew not how far"
he had rowed; he had lost count of his surroundings; he was absorbed in
"a deep reverie, when he was suddenly brought up breathless and wondering"
by the sound of a voice singing—a voice so clear and sweet and true that
"he asked himself whether it could be any creature of earth that sang, or"
whether it might be some nymph or mermaid such as sailors spoke of in
their wondrous tales.
"He gazed about him.  He saw that he was passing a garden, and that a"
group of weeping willows overhung the water at this spot.  The singing
"seemed to come from thence.  Burning curiosity possessed him, and he"
"very slowly and softly rowed himself onwards, till the prow of his boat"
met the drooping boughs with a soft rustle.  The song ceased suddenly.
"Grey turned in his seat, and drew himself within the sheltering shade;"
"as he did so, a quick exclamation broke from him.  He dropped his oars"
"as he exclaimed,—"
"""The Lady Geraldine!"""
*      *      *      *      *
How had it come about?  Grey never could have said.  But now it was all
told—the story of his chequered life.  She had been silent at the
"first—not exactly resentful of his intrusion, not unwilling to let him"
"have speech of her again, but quiet, with a maidenly reserve and dignity"
She made him a formal bow and was leaving the room; but his voice
stopped her.
"“Your anxiety cannot be very great, or you would wait to learn whether"
your suspicions are baseless or not.”
"She paused, in a dignified attitude, with her hand on the back of a"
"chair, while he adjusted his gold pince-nez and ran through the list."
"“You are right so far,” he said coldly. “The names are identical.”"
They parted at the door. The Canon walked back to his hotel with anger
"in his heart. In spite of cumulative evidence, the theory that his"
cousin had insinuated was prima facie preposterous. It was important
"enough, however, to need some investigation. But the feeling uppermost"
in his mind was indignation with Mrs. Winstanley. He was too shrewd a
man not to have perceived long ago her jealousy of Yvonne; but beyond
"keeping a watchful eye lest his wife should receive hurt, he had not"
"condescended to take it into serious consideration. Now, beneath her"
impressive manner he clearly divined the desire to inflict on Yvonne
"a deadly injury. To have leaped at such a conclusion, to have sought"
"subsequent proof from the Visitors’ List, argued malicious design. He"
could never forgive her.
Still the matter had to be cleared up at once. On his arrival at the
"Océan, he went forthwith to Yvonne’s room, and entered on receiving an"
acknowledgment of his knock. She was standing in the light of the window
"by the toilet table, doing her hair. The rest of the room was in the"
shadow of the gathering evening.
"“Well,” she said, without turning, “are they coming?”"
"The mail arranged, Trude sat back in the cushions of a great wicker"
chair and with a long breath of delight enjoyed the beauty around her.
Each day Edgeacres enraptured her anew and roused in her a wonder as to
"why it should be her lot to be there. ""It ought to be Vick or Issy,"""
"she would apologize to the nodding flowers or to Mitie, the yellow"
warbler.
And as might be expected Trude had found innumerable ways of making
herself useful to Mrs. White as an expression of her gratitude. There
"were telephone calls she could answer, letters she could write,"
"shopping she could do, ordering, she even conferred with old Pepper and"
"Jonathan, the gardener. She drove with Mrs. White in the afternoon and"
served tea to the callers who flocked to the house from the nearby
summer hotels.
"""I do not know how I ever got along without you, my dear,"" Mrs. White"
"had said more than once. ""What do you do to make yourself so"
invaluable? It seems as though just to look at you one leans on you!
Even Pepper is saying 'Miss Trude thinks this and Miss Trude thinks
"that--'"""
"Her benevolent interest in her husband's wards, a certain pride in"
"saying to her friends: ""My husband, you know, is looking after the"
"daughters of Joseph Romley, who was a college friend of his,"" had grown"
"into a real fondness for Trude. ""I have never appreciated the dear girl"
"when she's been with us before,"" she declared to her husband. ""I"
"suppose it was because we were in town, then, and I was too busy to get"
"acquainted with her. Why, she's really pretty. And she makes such a"
slave of herself to her sisters! She hasn't any life of her own. I
"don't believe they appreciate it, either. It's a shame she doesn't"
"marry some nice young man--"" Mrs. White's kind always found virtue's"
exclaimed aloud and covered their eyes for a moment to shut out the
hideous sight of them. Now they examined them closely.
Manlike they were: and yet like no human being conceivable to an Earth
mind. They were tremendously tall--twelve feet at least--but as thin
as so many animated poles. Their two legs were scarce four inches
"through, taper-less, boneless, like lengths of pipe; and like two"
flexible pipes they were joined to a slightly larger pipe of a torso
that could not have been more than a foot in diameter. There were four
"arms, a pair on each side of the cylindrical body, that weaved feebly"
about like lengths of rubber hose.
"Set directly on the pipe-like body, as a pumpkin might be balanced on"
"a pole, was a perfectly round cranium in which were glassy, staring"
"eyes, with dull pupils like those of a sick dog. The nose was but a"
"tab of flesh. The mouth was a minute, circular thing, soft and flabby"
"looking, which opened and shut regularly with the creature's"
"breathing. It resembled the snout-like mouth of a fish, of the sucker"
"variety; and fish-like, too, was the smooth and slimy skin that"
covered the beanpole body.
*       *       *       *       *
"Hundreds of the repulsive things, there were. And all of them shoved"
"and crowded, as a disorderly mob on Earth might do, to get close to"
the Earthmen's ship. Their big dull eyes peered in through the glass
"panels, and their hands--mere round blobs of gristle in the palms of"
which were set single sucker disks--pattered against the metal hull of
the shell.
"""God!"" said Brand with a shudder. ""Fancy these things feeling over"
"your body...."""
"who don't worry about Tom, Dick, or Harry, but choose an Orestes at"
"least for their tormenting; so that, when they give up their pursuit"
"of a Risca, he may excusably regard it as a personal slight. It was the"
morose and gloomy nature of the man.
"“I know I 'm a fool,” he said to Herold, when every one had gone to bed,"
“but I can't help it. Any normal person would regard me as insane if
I told him I was stopped from saving the wreck of my career by
consideration for the temporary comfort of a bedridden chit of a girl
"half my age, who is absolutely nothing to me in the world (her uncle"
"married my first cousin. If that is anything of a family tie, I'm weak"
on family feeling); but that's God's truth. I'm tied by her to this
"accursed country. She just holds me down in the hell of London, and I"
"can't wriggle away. It's senseless, I know it is. Sometimes when I 'm"
"away from her, walking on the beach, I feel I 'd like to throw the whole"
of this confounded house into the sea; and then I look up and see the
"light in her room, and--I--I just begin to wonder whether she 's asleep"
and what she's dreaming of. There 's some infernal witchcraft about the
child.”
"“There is,” said Herold."
"“Rot!” said Risca, his pugnacious instincts awakened by the check on"
his dithyrambics. “The whole truth of the matter is that I'm simply a
sentimental fool.”
"“All honour to you, John,” said Herold."
"“If you talk like that, I 'll wring your neck,” said Risca, pausing for"
"à second in his walk up and down Sir Oliver's library, and glaring down"
"at his friend, who reclined on the sofa and regarded him with a smile"
"exasperatingly wise. “You know I'm a fool, and why can't you say it? A"
labour. In the telegram from London Mr. Chamberlain states that the
Viceroy has informed him that Indians will be eligible for commissions
in the New Defence of India Army.
MARCH OF WORLD TRAGEDY
In the meantime the Embodiment of World Tragedy is marching with giant
strides. Brief will be his hesitation whether he will choose to step
"first to the East or to the West. Already across the Atlantic, they are"
preparing for the dreaded visitation. In the farthest East they have
long been prepared. We alone are not ready. Pity for our helplessness
"will not stay the impending disaster, rather provoke it. When that"
"comes, as assuredly it will unless we are prepared to resist, havoc will"
be let loose and horrors perpetrated before which the imagination quails
back in dismay.
I have tried to lay before you as dispassionately as I could the issues
"involved. But some of you may cry out and say, we can not live in cold"
scientific and philosophic abstractions. Emotion is more to us than pure
reasoning. We cannot stay in this indecision which is paralysing our
wills and crushing the soul out of us. The world is offering their best
and behold them marching to be immolated so that by the supreme offering
of death they might win safety and honor for their motherland. There is
no time for wavering. We too will throw in our lot with those who are
fighting. They say that by our lives we shall win for our birth-land an
honoured place in their federation. We shall trust them. We shall stand
by their side and fight for our home and homeland. And let Providence
shape the Issue.
Of course I ought to be old enough to understand what all sensible
"Norwegians know, that our country is once more on the right road. The"
papers are all writing about the splendid progress the tourist traffic has
made in Stordalen since the motor road was opened--ought I not to go there
and feel gratified?
"From old habit, I still take an interest in the few of us who are left;"
Miss Torsen is still here.
"Miss Torsen--what more is there to be said about her? Well, she does not"
"leave; she stays here to complete the picture of the woman Torsen, child"
of the middle class who has read schoolbooks all through her formative
"years, who has learned all about _Artemis cotula_, but undernourished"
her soul. That is what she is doing here.
"I remember a few weeks ago, when we were infested with Englishmen, a young"
sprout coming down from the mountain top with a bloodstained rag which he
"threw on the ground, saying, ""Here's what's left of your lawyer that fell"
"off!"" Miss Torsen heard it, and never moved a muscle. No, she never"
"mourned the death of the lawyer very keenly; on the contrary, she wrote"
"off at once to ask another friend to come. When he came, he turned out to"
"be a swaggering scatterbrain--a ""free lance,"" he called himself in the"
visitors' book. I have not mentioned him before because he was less
"important than she; less important, in fact, than any of us. He was"
beardless and wore his collar open; heaven knows if he wasn't employed at
"a theater or in the films. Miss Torsen went to meet him when he came, and"
"said, ""Welcome to our mountains,"" and ""Thanks for coming."" So evidently"
she had sent for him. But why did she not leave? Why did she seem to
"strike root in the place, and even ask others to come here? Yet she had"
been the first to want to leave last summer! There was something behind
this.
Eilert and I followed to my room.
*       *       *       *       *
"As a matter of fact, I went out again with Eilert at once. He had a great"
"deal to tell me and explain to me, and I was not unwilling to listen to"
"him then. Really, Eilert was not too bad, a fine fellow with four ragged,"
"magnificent youngsters by his first wife, who had died two years before,"
"and another child by his second wife. He must have forgotten, as he told"
"me this, the yarn about the sick wife and the ailing children that he had"
spun for me last winter. The girl who had come down the stairs with the
"message from the ""missis"" was no servant, but Eilert's young wife. And"
"she, too, was all right--strong and good, handy about the stables, and"
pregnant again.
"It all looks good to me, Eilert: your wife and everything you tell me"
about your family.
"No one will understand my strange contentment, then; I had been full of an"
obscure happiness from the moment I came to this house. Probably a mere
"coincidence, but that did not detract from my satisfactory state of mind;"
"I was pleased with everything, and all things added to my cheerful frame"
"of mind. There were some pigs by the barn, very affectionate pigs, because"
they were used to the children playing with them and kissing them and
"riding on their backs. And there was one of the goats, up on the roof of"
"course, standing so far out along the edge that it was a wonder he didn't"
"grow dizzy. Seagulls flew criss-cross over the fields, screaming their"
"own language to one another, and being friends or enemies to the best of"
"their ability. Down by the mouth of the river, just beneath the sunset,"
began the great road that winds up through the woods and the valley. There
is something of the friendliness of a living being about such a forest
"aroused within me a deep sympathy, which had, within an hour, developed"
into that great and tender love of old.  With men this return to the old
"love is of no infrequent occurrence, but with women it seldom happens."
Perhaps this is because man is more fickle and more easily influenced by
"woman's voice, woman's glances, and woman's tears."
The reader will probably accuse me of injustice and of fickleness of
"heart.  Well, I cannot deny it; indeed, I seek to deny nothing in this"
"narrative of strange facts and diplomatic wiles, but would only ask of"
those who read to withhold their verdict until they have ascertained the
"truth yet to be revealed, and have read to the conclusion, this strange"
chapter of the secret history of a nation.
"My friend the doctor was holding one hand, while I imprinted a last kiss"
"upon the other.  A lump was in my throat, my eyes were filled with"
"tears, my thoughts were all of the past, my anguish of heart"
"unspeakable.  That small chill hand with the cold, glittering ring--one"
that I had given her in Brussels long ago--seemed to be the only reality
in all that hideous phantasmagoria of events.
"""Do not despair,"" murmured the kind voice of my old friend, standing"
"opposite me on the other side of the bed.  ""You loved her once, but it"
"is all over--surely it is!"""
"""No, Dick!""  I answered brokenly.  ""I thought I did not love her.  I"
"have held her from me these three years--until now."""
"""Ah!"" he sighed, ""I understand.  Man always longs for the unattainable."""
"""Yes, always,"" I responded."
In that moment the memory of the day when we had parted arose gaunt and
"on the one side, and accuracy on the other. The true Fairy Tale should"
be unhampered by any compromise of probability even--the scientific
representation should be sufficiently marvellous along its own lines to
need no supernatural aid. Both appeal to the imagination in different
ways.
"As an exception to this kind of mixture, I should quote “The Honey Bee,"
"and Other Stories,” translated from the Danish of Evald by C. G. Moore"
Smith. There is a certain robustness in these stories dealing with the
"inexorable laws of Nature, though some of them will appear hard to the"
child; but they will be of interest to all teachers.
Perhaps the worst element in choice of stories is that which insists
upon the moral detaching itself and explaining the story. In “Alice in
"Wonderland” the Duchess says, “‘And the moral of _that_ is: Take care"
of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves.’ ‘How fond
"she is of finding morals in things,’ thought Alice to herself.” (This"
gives the point of view of the child.)
"The following is a case in point, found in a rare old print in the"
British Museum:
“Jane S. came home with her clothes soiled and hands badly torn. ‘Where
"have you been?’ asked her mother. ‘I fell down the bank near the mill,’"
"said Jane, ‘and I should have been drowned if Mr. M. had not seen me"
and pulled me out.’ 'Why did you go so near the edge of the brink?‘
"'There was a pretty flower there that I wanted, and I only meant to"
"take one step, but I slipped and fell down.’ Moral: Young people often"
"take but one step in sinful indulgence (Poor Jane!), but they fall"
into soul-destroying sins. There is a sinful pleasure which they wish
to enjoy. They can do it by a single act of sin (the heinous act of
"picking a flower!). They do it; but that act leads to another, and they"
And on Mrs. James Williams’s face was recorded a little library of the
world’s best thoughts in three volumes. Volume No. 1 contained the
belief that James Williams was about the right sort of thing. Volume
"No. 2 was an essay on the world, declaring it to be a very excellent"
place. Volume No. 3 disclosed the belief that in occupying the highest
seat in a Rubberneck auto they were travelling the pace that passes all
understanding.
"James Williams, you would have guessed, was about twenty-four. It will"
gratify you to know that your estimate was so accurate. He was exactly
"twenty-three years, eleven months and twenty-nine days old. He was well"
"built, active, strong-jawed, good-natured and rising. He was on his"
wedding trip.
"Dear kind fairy, please cut out those orders for money and 40 H. P."
touring cars and fame and a new growth of hair and the presidency of
"the boat club. Instead of any of them turn backward—oh, turn backward"
and give us just a teeny-weeny bit of our wedding trip over again. Just
"an hour, dear fairy, so we can remember how the grass and poplar trees"
"looked, and the bow of those bonnet strings tied beneath her chin—even"
if it was the hatpins that did the work. Can’t do it? Very well; hurry
"up with that touring car and the oil stock, then."
Just in front of Mrs. James Williams sat a girl in a loose tan jacket
and a straw hat adorned with grapes and roses. Only in dreams and
"milliners’ shops do we, alas! gather grapes and roses at one swipe."
"This girl gazed with large blue eyes, credulous, when the megaphone man"
roared his doctrine that millionaires were things about which we should
be concerned. Between blasts she resorted to Epictetian philosophy in
the form of pepsin chewing gum.
An Ideal Family
"That evening for the first time in his life, as he pressed through the"
"swing door and descended the three broad steps to the pavement, old Mr."
"Neave felt he was too old for the spring. Spring—warm, eager,"
"restless—was there, waiting for him in the golden light, ready in front"
"of everybody to run up, to blow in his white beard, to drag sweetly on"
"his arm. And he couldn’t meet her, no; he couldn’t square up once more"
"and stride off, jaunty as a young man. He was tired and, although the"
"late sun was still shining, curiously cold, with a numbed feeling all"
"over. Quite suddenly he hadn’t the energy, he hadn’t the heart to stand"
this gaiety and bright movement any longer; it confused him. He wanted
"to stand still, to wave it away with his stick, to say, “Be off with"
you!” Suddenly it was a terrible effort to greet as usual—tipping his
"wide-awake with his stick—all the people whom he knew, the friends,"
"acquaintances, shopkeepers, postmen, drivers. But the gay glance that"
"went with the gesture, the kindly twinkle that seemed to say, “I’m a"
match and more for any of you”—that old Mr. Neave could not manage at
"all. He stumped along, lifting his knees high as if he were walking"
through air that had somehow grown heavy and solid like water. And the
"homeward-looking crowd hurried by, the trams clanked, the light carts"
"clattered, the big swinging cabs bowled along with that reckless,"
defiant indifference that one knows only in dreams....
It had been a day like other days at the office. Nothing special had
happened. Harold hadn’t come back from lunch until close on four. Where
had he been? What had he been up to? He wasn’t going to let his father
"know. Old Mr. Neave had happened to be in the vestibule, saying"
"Daphne Wing sighed out: ""Oh, Mrs. Fiorsen!"" and, bending over that hand,"
"kissed it.  Gyp saw that her new glove was wet.  Then the girl relapsed,"
"her feet a little forward, her head a little forward, her back against"
"the door.  Gyp, who knew why she stood thus, was swept again by those two"
"emotions--rage against men, and fellow feeling for one about to go"
through what she herself had just endured.
"""It's all right,"" she said, gently; ""only, what's to be done?"""
Daphne Wing put her hands up over her white face and sobbed.  She sobbed
so quietly but so terribly deeply that Gyp herself had the utmost
difficulty not to cry.  It was the sobbing of real despair by a creature
"bereft of hope and strength, above all, of love--the sort of weeping"
"which is drawn from desolate, suffering souls only by the touch of fellow"
"feeling.  And, instead of making Gyp glad or satisfying her sense of"
"justice, it filled her with more rage against her husband--that he had"
taken this girl's infatuation for his pleasure and then thrown her away.
"She seemed to see him discarding that clinging, dove-fair girl, for"
"cloying his senses and getting on his nerves, discarding her with caustic"
"words, to abide alone the consequences of her infatuation.  She put her"
"hand timidly on that shaking shoulder, and stroked it.  For a moment the"
"sobbing stopped, and the girl said brokenly:"
"""Oh, Mrs. Fiorsen, I do love him so!""  At those naive words, a painful"
"wish to laugh seized on Gyp, making her shiver from head to foot.  Daphne"
"Wing saw it, and went on: ""I know--I know--it's awful; but I do--and now"
"he--he--""  Her quiet but really dreadful sobbing broke out again.  And"
"again Gyp began stroking and stroking her shoulder.  ""And I have been so"
"awful to you!  Oh, Mrs. Fiorsen, do forgive me, please!"""
"All Gyp could find to answer, was:"
"told Sir Oliver to go to the devil with his lugubrious and rotten game,"
and dashed away to the solitude of the beach until the luncheon-bell
summoned him back.
"“I'm going by the 3:50,” said he at the luncheon-table."
At three o'clock Stella was free to see him again. He went up to her
room distinctly determined to shut his heart against folly. The sun
had crept round toward the west and flooded the head and shoulders of
"Stellamaris and the dainty bedspread with pale gold, just as it flooded"
the now still and smiling sea. Again paralysis fell upon John. The words
"he was to speak were to him, as well as to her, the words of doom, and"
"he could not utter them. They talked of vain, childish things. Then"
Stellamaris's clock chimed the three-quarters. There are some chimes
"that are brutal, others ironic; but Stellamaris's chimes (the clock was"
"a gift from John himself) were soft, and pealed a soothing mystery, like"
a bell swung in a deep sea-cave.
"It was a quarter to four, and he had missed his train once more. Well,"
"the train could go to--to London, as good a synonym for Tophet as any"
"other. So he stayed, recklessly surrendering himself to the pale, sunlit"
"peace of the sea-chamber, till he was dislodged by Lady Blount."
An attempt to catch a six o'clock train was equally unsuccessful. He did
not return to town that night. Why should a sorely bruised man reject
"the balm that healed? To-morrow he would be stronger and more serene,"
"abler to control the driving force of the Furies, and therefore fitted"
to announce in gentler wise the decrees of destiny. So Risca went to bed
"and slept easier, and the room which Stellamaris had made for him became"
the enchanted bower of a Fair Lady of All Mercy.
In their simple human way Sir Oliver and Lady Blount besought him to
leaning right over his patient. I had been conscious of a powerful
"impulse to duck down, but I grasped the table and gave way to the"
impulse so far as to lean slightly forward. This compromise saved me
from any violent expression of fear. The Sister was the only one of us
who showed no sign of fear at all.
The surgeon went on with his work and extracted several fragments of
bone from the injured limb. A few seconds passed and suddenly the
electric light went out in accordance with the orders that decreed that
all lights should be extinguished on the approach of hostile aeroplanes.
The surgeon cursed loudly and the Sister fetched an electric torch which
"she held over the knee. The operation continued, but it was not long"
before anti-aircraft fire broke out once more. Then there was a weird
"bustling, rushing sound, followed by a roar that again shook the theatre"
and rattled the windows. Six explosions followed in rapid succession.
"This time the orderly controlled himself, for he knew the Sister was"
"watching. Nevertheless, his knees trembled violently. The Sister held"
the torch steadily and the surgeon paused for a moment and went on with
the operation as soon as all was quiet.
In a few minutes it was finished. The wound was dressed and bandaged and
the patient carried away.
I stepped out into the clear night. The sky was thronged with glittering
"stars. Everything seemed strangely peaceful. I walked round the station,"
"trying to find out where the bombs had fallen, but nobody knew. I went"
"to the marquee and found Private Trotter sitting there, breathless and"
white. The neighbouring C.C.S. a few hundred yards away had been hit. A
Sister and an orderly had been killed and several patients wounded.
"""It didn't 'alf put me wind up,"" said Trotter, excitedly. ""When the"
first'n drops I lays down flat on the duckboards and one bursts just
"modesty. ""When I heard how the enemy plotted and Dawson"
counter-plotted with all those skilled workmen in his detective
"service, it occurred to me that an enemy with imagination might"
counter-counterplot by getting men inside Dawson's defences. I
"couldn't see how one would work it, but if German agents, say, could"
"manage to become trusted servants of Dawson himself, they would have"
"the time of their lives. So far I was guessing at a possibility,"
however improbable it might seem. Then when Dawson told us that he had
sent Trehayne into the _Antigone_ and that he was the one factor
common to both vessels--the workmen and the maintenance part were all
different--I began to feel that my wild theory might have something in
"it. I didn't say anything to you, Cary, or to Dawson--he despises"
"theories. Afterwards Trehayne came in and I spoke to him, and he to"
"me, in French. He did not utter a dozen words altogether, but I was"
absolutely certain that his French had not been learned at an English
public school and during short trips on the Continent. I know too much
of English school French and of one's opportunities to learn upon
Continental trips. It took me three years of hard work to recover from
"the sort of French which I learned at school, and I am not well yet."
The French spoken by Trehayne was the French of the nursery. It was
"almost, if not quite, his mother tongue, just as his English was."
Trehayne's French accent did not fit into Trehayne's history as
retailed to us by Dawson. From that moment I plumped for Trehayne as
"the cutter of gun wires."""
"Dawson had been listening, though he showed no interest in my speech."
"When I had quite finished, and was basking in the respectful"
"admiration emanating from dear old Cary, he upset over me a bucket of"
very cold water.
"""Very pretty,"" said he. ""But answer one question. Why did I send"
"Trehayne to the _Antigone_?"""
Propped against the circular walls were the first lieutenant and two
seamen. All the occupants of the conning-tower had been overcome by
the noxious fumes from the highly-charged projectile.
Gasping for fresh air Terence flung himself upon the steam-steering
gear and put the helm hard over. A glimpse through one of the slits
revealed the fact that the cruiser was answering to her helm. Yet so
"narrowly had a collision been averted that the ""Sunderland's"""
"starboard side was within twenty feet of the ""Bradford's"" port"
quarter as the two vessels swung apart.
"The guns were now silent, for with the destruction of the foremast"
the fire-control platform and its occupants had been swept out of
existence. The cruiser was temporarily out of action.
"Terence was beginning to feel dizzy and faint. Why, he knew not."
Perhaps it was the pungent fumes. Leaning over the mouthpiece of the
speaking tube he ordered a couple of quartermasters to be sent to the
conning-tower. He could hardly recognize the sound of his own voice.
It seemed miles away.
Again he looked ahead. The cruiser was still drawing further and
further out of range. Having satisfied himself on that score and that
there was no fresh danger of colliding with any of the rest of the
"fleet, he staggered into the open air and leaned heavily against the"
"outer wall of the conning-tower, He was barely conscious that the"
metal was still hot.
"Up came the quartermasters. At their heels was a sub-lieutenant, his"
face grimed with smoke and his uniform torn.
"""Take over, Garboard,"" ordered the lieutenant brokenly. ""Report to"
"pronounced it to be first-class petrol. There were seven drums, each"
containing four gallons.
"""This means we'll motor, not walk into Robat after all, sir,"" said"
"Allan, with a grin and sigh of relief. The thought of those miles of"
desert--nearly two hundred of them--which confronted us after the
mishap had been haunting us both like a nightmare.
"At this moment the _chokidar_ returned, in great trepidation, fearing"
a dressing-down for being absent from duty. But I was far too elated
at the turn of events to want to swear at anyone.
"I asked him where the petrol had come from, and whose it was. He"
"shook his head, and said he had no idea. It had always been there. It"
"belonged to no one, and no one had put it there, so far as he knew."
"He had never seen a car there before; in fact, he had never seen a"
"car anywhere before, and could not understand how it was that men"
"could travel on a thing which was not alive, which was not like any"
horse or camel he had ever seen.
"This was all very good hearing, so I proceeded to tell him that the"
"petrol belonged to me, and, as he quite cheerfully acquiesced, I gave"
him a receipt which he could show to any Government official in case
of needed absolution in the future. As we now had means to finish our
"journey by car, I decided to spend the night at the rest-house."
"After a simple camp meal Allan, worn out with the strenuous work of"
"the past two days and night, was quickly snoring in the deep sleep of"
"exhaustion, so I went for a stroll."
As I paced up and down I tried to draw up some preliminary plan
"for the coming campaign. But such occupation was somewhat futile,"
"""You're such a big baby to've been such a big soldier! Don't you know"
"that romance is always just over the hill, hand in hand with"
adventure--both lonely for someone to play with? Wars can't kill them!
"It's after wars, when a nation is wounded, that they become priceless!"""
"""By George, that's right,"" Dad cried. ""Come to think of it, that's"
exactly right! And Gates has the same crew of six--men you've always
"known! Even that rascal, Pete, cooks better 'n ever! The _Whim_, you"
"can't deny, is the smartest ninety-six foot schooner yacht that sails! I"
say again that if I had the chance I'd turn her free on whatever magic
"course the wings of the wind would take her! That I would--by George!"""
And there was a note of deep appeal in the Mater's voice as she asked:
"""Why not get that boy you wrote so much about--Tommy what's-his-name,"
"the Southerner? I like him!"""
"This plan, which I now saw had been so carefully prepared--fruit of the"
secret conference--was but one in the million or so of others throughout
"America nurtured and matured by the brave army of fathers, mothers,"
"wives, sisters, daughters, who stayed at home and gave their all,"
"waiting with alternate hopes and fears, looking with prayerful eyes to"
the day that would bring a certain one back into their arms. What
difference if some plans were elaborate and some as modest as a flower?
Who would dare distinguish between the cruise on a private yacht and the
cake endearingly made in a hot little kitchen for the husky lad just
returned from overseas? Each was its own best expression of pride and
"love. Each said in its tenderest way: ""Well done, my own!"""
A lump came into my throat.
"""It's rather decent of a fellow to have two such corking forbears,"" I"
"""I did not express that opinion,"" he hastened to protest.  ""Before we"
discuss the matter further it will be best for me to see her.  Death may
"have been due to natural causes, for aught we know."""
I stood motionless.  His suggestion that my sweetheart of the old days
had committed suicide because I had forsaken her was a startling one.
Surely that could not be so?
"""Come,"" my friend said, ""let us lose no time.  Which is the room?"""
"I led him along the corridor, and opened the door of the chamber in"
which she was lying so cold and still.  The light of the afterglow fell
"full upon her, tipping her auburn hair with crimson and illuminating her"
face with a warm radiance that gave her back the appearance of life.
"But it was only for a few moments.  The slanting ray was lost, and the"
pallor of that beautiful countenance became marked against the gold of
her wondrous hair.
"In silence I stood at the foot of the bed watching my friend, who was"
now busy with his examination.  He opened her eyes and closed them
"again, felt her heart, raised her arms, and examined her mouth, uttering"
no word.  His serious face wore a look as though he were infinitely
puzzled.
One after the other he examined the palms of her hands long and
"carefully, then, bending until his eyes were close to her face, he"
"examined her lips, brow, and the whole surface of her cheeks.  Upon her"
"neck, below the left ear, was a mark to which he returned time after"
"time, as though not satisfied as to its cause.  Upon her lower lip, too,"
"was a slight yellow discoloration, which he examined several times,"
comparing it with the mark upon the neck.  He was unable to account for
ghost-like.  I had wronged her; I felt confident that I had.  All came
"back to me now--that cruel, scandalous denunciation I had uttered in the"
heat of my mad jealousy--the false tale which had struck her dumb by its
"circumstantial accuracy.  Ah! how bitter it all was, now that punishment"
"was upon me!  I remembered how, in the hour of my worldly triumph and of"
her highest hope--at the very moment when she had spoken words of
greater affection to me than she had ever used before--I had made the
"charge against her, and she had fallen back with her young heart crushed"
"within her.  My ring was there, still glittering mockingly upon her dead"
hand.  By the unfounded charge I had made against her I had sinned.  My
"sin at that moment arose from its grave, and barred the way for ever to"
all hope--to all happiness.
"The summer twilight was stealing on apace, and in the silence of the"
room there sounded the roar of life from the boulevard below.  Men were
"crying _Le Soir_ with strident voices, and all Paris was on its way to"
"dine, and afterwards to enjoy itself in idleness upon the terraces of"
the cafes or at those al-fresco variety performances in the Avenue des
"Champs Elysees, where the entrance fee includes a consommation."
"Deane still held my old love's hand, bending in the dim light until his"
"eyes were close to it, watching intently.  But I took no notice, for my"
"eyes were fixed upon that face that had held me in such fascination, and"
had been so admired at those brilliant receptions given by King Leopold
"and the Countess of Flanders.  The doctor stretched forth his hand, and"
of a sudden switched on the electric light.  The next instant I was
startled by his loud ejaculation of surprise.
"""Thank God!"" he cried.  ""She's not dead, after all!"""
"""Not dead!""  I gasped, unable fully to realise his meaning."
"this, in his own words, he ""just lived!  And lived well too, Devil take"
"it, and like one who knew how!"""
"He was a tall, broad-shouldered man of fifty, with a rawlooking face,"
"swollen with drunkenness, and with a dirty yellowish beard. His eyes"
"were large and grey, with an insolent expression of happiness.  He"
"spoke in a bass voice and with a sort of grumbling sound in his throat,"
and he almost always held between his teeth a German china pipe with a
long bowl.  When he was angry the nostrils of his big crooked red nose
"swelled, and his lips trembled, exposing to view two rows of large and"
"wolf-like yellow teeth.  He had long arms, was lame, and always dressed"
"in an old officer's uniform, with a dirty, greasy cap with a red band,"
"a hat without a brim, and ragged felt boots which reached almost to his"
"knees.  In the morning, as a rule, he had a heavy drunken headache, and"
"in the evening he caroused.  However much he drank, he was never drunk,"
and so was always merry.
"In the evenings he received lodgers, sitting on his brickmade bench"
with his pipe in his mouth.
"""Whom have we here?"" he would ask the ragged and tattered object"
"approaching him, who had probably been chucked out of the town for"
"drunkenness, or perhaps for some other reason not quite so simple.  And"
"after the man had answered him, he would say, ""Let me see legal papers"
"in confirmation of your lies.""  And if there were such papers they were"
"shown.  The Captain would then put them in his bosom, seldom taking any"
"interest in them, and would say:"
"""Everything is in order.  Two kopecks for the night, ten kopecks for"
"the week, and thirty kopecks for the month.  Go and get a place for"
"yourself, and see that it is not other people's, or else they will blow"
"you up.  The people that live here are particular."""
brother-in-law forbidden information from a loyal desire to help him
and with no knowledge of the base use to which it would be put. When
"detected, he had sought at any cost to shield him."
"""I will do my best to help you,"" I said."
"His head drooped down till it rested upon his bent arms, and he"
groaned and panted under the torture of tears. His was not the stuff
of which criminals are made.
"I found Dawson's chuckling joy rather repulsive. I felt that, being"
"successful, he might at least have had the decency to dissemble his"
satisfaction. He might also have given me some credit for the rapid
clearing up of the problem in detection. But he took the whole thing
"to himself, and gloated like a child over his own cleverness. I"
neither obtained from him thanks for my assistance nor apologies for
"his suspicions. It was Dawson, Dawson, all the time. Yet I found his"
egotism and unrelieved vanity extraordinarily interesting. As we sat
together in his room waiting for the Carlisle train to come in he
"discoursed freely to me of his triumphs in detection, his wide-spread"
"system of spying upon spies, his long delayed ""sport"" with some, and"
his ruthless rapid trapping of others. Men are never so interesting as
"when they talk shop, and as a talker of shop Dawson was sublime."
"""If,"" said Dawson, as the time approached for the closing scene, ""our"
much-wanted friend has himself handed in the parcel at Carlisle--he
"would be afraid to trust an accomplice--our job will be done. If not,"
I will pull a drag net through this place which will bring him up
within a day or two. What a fool the man is to think that he could
"escape the eye of Bill Dawson."""
"A policeman entered, laid a packet upon the table before us, and"
"of horns, the shouting of commands."
The duke and Francesco had dismounted and were gazing up towards the
storm-swept ramparts. Shrieks and curses rolled down upon them like
the tumbling of a cascade.
"Then they began to scale the ledge, the path dwindling to a goat's"
highway.
Above them rose a sheer wall on which there appeared not clinging
space for a lizard. The abyss below was ready to welcome them to
perdition if their feet slipped.
"After a brief respite they continued, the duke's men scrambling up"
"behind them, looking like so many ants on the white chalk-cliffs. The"
"air was hot to suffocation; the storm roared, the thunder bellowed in"
"deafening echoes through the skies, and the heavens seemed one blazing"
"cataract of fire, reflected in the throbbing mirror of the sea."
"They had reached a seam in the rock, where they paused for a moment to"
let their brains rest. There was hardly room for the duke and
"Francesco on the ledge, so narrow was the rocky shelf, and the latter"
was pushing close against the wall when he was suddenly forced to look
"up. He heard the din of the encounter above. The Pisans, having"
"attacked the Frangipani from the south, were driving them out at the"
"north. Suddenly two bodies whizzed by him, thrust over the ramparts in"
the fierceness of the assault. Another came; he seemed to have jumped
"for life, for he kept feet foremost for a distance through the air,"
"before he began to whirl. These fell clear of the scaling party, and"
"were impaled on the broken tops of the stunted trees, that bossed the"
side of the precipice. One came so near the duke that his flight
downward almost blew him off his narrow perch. His head struck the
Monsieur Edouard Harmost inhabited the ground floor of a house in the
Marylebone Road.  He received his pupils in a large back room overlooking
"a little sooty garden.  A Walloon by extraction, and of great vitality,"
"he grew old with difficulty, having a soft corner in his heart for women,"
"and a passion for novelty, even for new music, that was unappeasable."
Any fresh discovery would bring a tear rolling down his mahogany cheeks
"into his clipped grey beard, the while he played, singing wheezily to"
"elucidate the wondrous novelty; or moved his head up and down, as if"
pumping.
"When Gyp was shown into this well-remembered room he was seated, his"
"yellow fingers buried in his stiff grey hair, grieving over a pupil who"
"had just gone out.  He did not immediately rise, but stared hard at Gyp."
"""Ah,"" he said, at last, ""my little old friend!  She has come back! Now"
"that is good!""  And, patting her hand he looked into her face, which had"
"a warmth and brilliance rare to her in these days.  Then, making for the"
"mantelpiece, he took therefrom a bunch of Parma violets, evidently"
"brought by his last pupil, and thrust them under her nose.  ""Take them,"
take them--they were meant for me.  Now--how much have you forgotten?
"Come!""  And, seizing her by the elbow, he almost forced her to the piano."
"""Take off your furs.  Sit down!"""
"And while Gyp was taking off her coat, he fixed on her his prominent"
"brown eyes that rolled easily in their slightly blood-shot whites, under"
squared eyelids and cliffs of brow.  She had on what Fiorsen called her
"""humming-bird"" blouse--dark blue, shot with peacock and old rose, and"
looked very warm and soft under her fur cap.  Monsieur Harmost's stare
"seemed to drink her in; yet that stare was not unpleasant, having in it"
only the rather sad yearning of old men who love beauty and know that
their time for seeing it is getting short.
"throat. After all, he was going to win! Out of the shimmering distance"
"of his desire, the lady of his dreams drew closer to him; and ere long"
"he could lay at her feet the burden of his travail, and then--."
"Oblivious to the turmoil all about, he wrote rapidly, almost"
"incoherently, to Mildred, transcribing the mood of mingled tenderness"
and exultation which possessed him.
"""Outside the building,"" he concluded, ""there is a raging mob. They"
"would ruin me if they could, but they can't do it, they can't do it. We"
"have beaten them all, my lady. We have won!"""
"He was sealing his letter, when, without warning, ""Fingerless"" Fraser"
"appeared at his side, his fishlike eyes agleam, his colorless face"
drawn with anxiety.
"""They've come to grab you for killing that striker,"" he began,"
"breathlessly; ""there's a couple of 'square-toes' on the dock now."
"Better take it on the 'lam'--quick!"""
"""God!"" So Marsh had withheld this stroke until the last moment, when"
the least delay would be fatal. Boyd knew that if he were brought into
court he would have hard shift to clear himself against the mass of
perjured testimony that his rival had doubtless gathered; but even this
seemed as nothing in comparison with the main issue. For one wild
instant he considered sending George Balt on with the ship. That would
"be folly, no doubt; yet plainly he could not hold _The Bedford Castle_"
and keep together that raging army of fishermen while he fought his way
through the tedious vexations of a trial. He saw that he had
"under-estimated his enemy's cunning, and he realized that, if Marsh had"
"planned this move, he would press his advantage to the full."
"""There's two plain-clothes men,"" he heard Fraser running on. ""I 'made'"
"no way out and therefore preferred to make himself blind, which gave him"
an excuse for not seeing. Seven of our permanent guests now left together:
"the telephone operators, Tradesman Batt, Schoolmistresses Johnsen and"
"Palm, and two men who were in some sort of business, I don't quite know"
what. This whole party went across the fjeld to Stordalen to be driven
about in cars.
Cases of various kinds of foodstuffs arrived for Paul; they were carried
up one evening by a man from the village. He had to make several journeys
"with the side of his cart let down, and bring the cases over the roughest"
spots one by one. That was the kind of road it was. Josephine received the
"consignment, and noticed that one of the cases gave forth the sound of a"
"liquid splashing inside. That had come to the wrong place, she said, and"
"writing another address on it, she told the man to take it back. It was"
"sirup that had come too late, she said; she had got sirup elsewhere in the"
meantime.
Later in the evening we heard them discussing it in the kitchen; the sirup
"had not come too late, Paul said angrily."
"""And I've told you to clear these newspapers away!"" he cried. We heard the"
sound of paper and glass being swept to the floor.
"Well, things were not too easy for Paul; the days went by dull and empty,"
nor had he any children to give him pleasant thoughts at times. Though he
"wanted to build still more houses, he could not use half those he had"
already. There was Mrs. Brede living alone with her children in one of
"them, and since seven of the guests had left, Miss Torsen was also alone"
in the south wing. Paul wanted at all costs to build roads and share in
the development of the tourist traffic; he even wanted to run a fleet of
motor cars. But since he had not the power to do this alone and could get
"no assistance, nothing was left him but to resign himself. And now to make"
If you do not know Bogle’s Chop House and Family Restaurant it is your
loss. For if you are one of the fortunate ones who dine expensively you
should be interested to know how the other half consumes provisions.
And if you belong to the half to whom waiters’ checks are things of
"moment, you should know Bogle’s, for there you get your money’s"
"worth—in quantity, at least."
"Bogle’s is situated in that highway of _bourgeoisie_, that boulevard of"
"Brown-Jones-and-Robinson, Eighth Avenue. There are two rows of tables"
"in the room, six in each row. On each table is a caster-stand,"
containing cruets of condiments and seasons. From the pepper cruet you
"may shake a cloud of something tasteless and melancholy, like volcanic"
dust. From the salt cruet you may expect nothing. Though a man should
"extract a sanguinary stream from the pallid turnip, yet will his"
prowess be balked when he comes to wrest salt from Bogle’s cruets. Also
upon each table stands the counterfeit of that benign sauce made “from
the recipe of a nobleman in India.”
"At the cashier’s desk sits Bogle, cold, sordid, slow, smouldering, and"
"takes your money. Behind a mountain of toothpicks he makes your change,"
"files your check, and ejects at you, like a toad, a word about the"
weather. Beyond a corroboration of his meteorological statement you
"would better not venture. You are not Bogle’s friend; you are a fed,"
"transient customer, and you and he may not meet again until the blowing"
of Gabriel’s dinner horn. So take your change and go—to the devil if
you like. There you have Bogle’s sentiments.
The needs of Bogle’s customers were supplied by two waitresses and a
"Voice. One of the waitresses was named Aileen. She was tall, beautiful,"
"lively, gracious and learned in persiflage. Her other name? There was"
no more necessity for another name at Bogle’s than there was for
We drilled every morning from six o'clock until eight in the fields
outside the New Gate; the others went again at sunset to practise
"their weapons, but I was exempt from this drill, that the women might"
not be left alone. At all times we had our appointed rendezvous in
case of alarm or assault. The Swedish veterans strolled out of the
camp and stood to laugh at our clumsiness. But the excellent order
"which prevailed among them made them favourites, and we let them"
"laugh, and laughed again."
"The Waldgrave, who had long had Duke Bernard's promise, received a"
"regiment of horse, so that he lay in the camp and should have been a"
"contented man, since his strength had come back to him. But to my"
surprise he showed signs of lukewarmness. He seemed little interested
"in the service, and was often at my lady's house in the Ritter"
"Strasse, when he would have been better at his post. At first I set"
"this down to his passion for my lady, and it seemed excusable; but"
within a week I stood convinced that this no longer troubled him. He
"paid scant attention to her, but would sit for hours looking moodily"
into the street. And I--and not I alone--began to watch him closely.
I soon found that Count Hugo was right. The once gallant and splendid
young fellow was a changed man. He was still comely and a brave
"figure, but the spirit in him was quenched. He was nervous, absent,"
irritable. His eyes had a wild look; on strangers he made an
"unfavourable impression. Doubtless, though his wounds had healed,"
there remained some subtle injury that spoiled the man; and often I
"caught my lady looking at him sadly, and knew that I was not the only"
one with cause for mourning.
"But how strange he was we did not know until a certain day, when my"
"lady and I were engaged together over some accounts. It was evening,"
and the three men were away drilling. The house was very quiet.
"juste_. If you would kindly lock me up, say, for three years or the"
duration of the war I should be your debtor. I have often thought that
"a prison, provided that one were allowed unlimited paper and the use"
"of a typewriter, would be the most charming of holidays--a perfect"
rest cure. There are three books in my head which I should like to
"write. Arrest me, Dawson, I implore you! Put on the handcuffs--I have"
"never been handcuffed--ring up a taxi, and let us be off to jail. You"
"will, I hope, do me the honour of lunching with me first and meeting"
my wife. She will be immensely gratified to be quit of me. It cannot
"often have happened in your lurid career, Dawson, to be welcomed with"
"genuine enthusiasm."""
"""Why did that man say that he prepared the description of the ship for"
"you?"""
"""That is what we are going to find out, and I will help you all I can."
"My reputation is like the bloom upon the peach--touch it, and it is"
gone for ever. There is a faint glimmer of the truth at the back of my
mind which may become a clear light. Did he say that he had given it
"to me personally, into my own hand?"""
"""No. He said that he was approached by a man whom he had known off and"
"on for years, a man who was employed by you in connection with"
shipyard inquiries. He was informed that this man was still employed
"by you for the same purpose now as in the past."""
"""Your case against me is thinning out, Dawson. At its best it is"
"second-hand; at its worst, the mere conjecture of a rather careless"
draughtsman. I have two things to do: first to find out the real
"seducer, who is probably also the despatcher of the parcels to the"
"late lieutenant of Northumberland Fusiliers, and second, to save if I"
can this poor fool of a shipyard draughtsman from punishment for his
"good-bye to a caller, when Harold sauntered in, perfectly turned out as"
"usual, cool, suave, smiling that peculiar little half-smile that women"
found so fascinating.
"Ah, Harold was too handsome, too handsome by far; that had been the"
"trouble all along. No man had a right to such eyes, such lashes, and"
"such lips; it was uncanny. As for his mother, his sisters, and the"
"servants, it was not too much to say they made a young god of him; they"
"worshipped Harold, they forgave him everything; and he had needed some"
forgiving ever since the time when he was thirteen and he had stolen
"his mother’s purse, taken the money, and hidden the purse in the cook’s"
bedroom. Old Mr. Neave struck sharply with his stick upon the pavement
"edge. But it wasn’t only his family who spoiled Harold, he reflected,"
"it was everybody; he had only to look and to smile, and down they went"
before him. So perhaps it wasn’t to be wondered at that he expected the
"office to carry on the tradition. H’m, h’m! But it couldn’t be done. No"
"business—not even a successful, established, big paying concern—could"
be played with. A man had either to put his whole heart and soul into
"it, or it went all to pieces before his eyes...."
And then Charlotte and the girls were always at him to make the whole
"thing over to Harold, to retire, and to spend his time enjoying"
himself. Enjoying himself! Old Mr. Neave stopped dead under a group of
ancient cabbage palms outside the Government buildings! Enjoying
himself! The wind of evening shook the dark leaves to a thin airy
"cackle. Sitting at home, twiddling his thumbs, conscious all the while"
"that his life’s work was slipping away, dissolving, disappearing"
"through Harold’s fine fingers, while Harold smiled...."
"“Why will you be so unreasonable, father? There’s absolutely no need"
for you to go to the office. It only makes it very awkward for us when
people persist in saying how tired you’re looking. Here’s this huge
tightened and I stopped breathing altogether. But the explosion that
"followed was fainter than the last. Then there was another, still"
further off. All my muscles gradually relaxed and a delicious feeling of
relief pervaded my whole being. The buzzing noise became more and more
"feeble. I got up and walked back to the marquee, trembling and weak at"
the knees. The others followed.
"Most of us went to bed, but a few continued to pace up and down in great"
agitation. One man picked up his blankets in a bundle and went off in
"order to sleep in the open fields, far away from the camp."
An hour had hardly passed before distant anti-aircraft fire broke out
"again. Anxiety began to renew its tortures. We heard the dull, sullen"
roar of bombs exploding at intervals. Then fourteen burst in rapid
succession as though a gigantic ball of solid iron had bounced fourteen
times with thundering reverberations on a resonant surface. But the
sound of firing died down and soon all was quiet. And then sleep came
upon us and our troubles were over for a time.
The next morning was windless and clear. All day we kept looking at the
"sky, but not a cloud was to be seen."
"The evening approached, darkness fell, and the stars shone. ""Lights Out"""
"was sounded and we extinguished our candles. None of us said a word, but"
everybody knew what everybody else was thinking of. And soon we heard
"the familiar buzz. At first it only came from one propeller, but others"
"arrived and the sound multiplied and increased in volume, and at the"
same time it rose and fell in irregular gusts and regular pulsations.
Anti-aircraft firing burst out suddenly and for a few minutes there was
"a blending of whining, whistling, rushing sounds overhead punctuated by"
"faint reports. The firing ceased, but the droning noises continued"
louder than ever. The German aeroplanes seemed to be above us like a
The most angry of them all was Curly Kollock. He had double cause for
"wrath, having received that morning a letter from the very town of"
Lancaster toward which they were striving so hard to push the drive.
"Brief it was, and to the point. He had played the traitor, Bill wrote"
scathingly. There was only one way by which he could rid himself of the
"stigma, and return to the good graces of the gang. He must come at once"
"to a certain house on the outskirts of the town, prepared to place"
himself absolutely in his brother’s hands.
When the younger Kollock read those lines he swore roundly. That even
Bill should dare write in such a manner made him rage. He was no man’s
"slave, and there were bounds beyond which even a brother could step. He"
"was on the point of asking for time off to come to a definite, final"
settlement with the crowd when the attempted shooting occurred. At first
"this cowardly deed only added to his rage, but swiftly in its wake came"
unwonted gravity.
"Disagreeable, even serious, as all those other persecutions had been,"
not one of them held the weight of this last culminating effort to put
Bob Bainbridge out of the running. That Bill was mixed up in it Curly
"had no doubt, and the realization frightened him. He had always looked"
"up to his older brother with admiration and a little awe, and he could"
not bear now to think of him mixed up in anything so contemptible. There
"was the danger involved, too, and altogether the youngster felt as if he"
must see Bill at once and try to make him cut the gang and get away. His
"efforts might have no effect, but there was at least a chance."
"That night--or rather early in the morning, while it was still pitch"
black--he slipped quietly out of camp without a word to any one. He
"reached Lancaster at four in the afternoon, having made most of the"
journey in a scow doing about six miles an hour. Going at once to the
churches were ringing; some had services. I had to push my way to
reach Herr Krapp's house in time; but once there the crowd of passers
"served my purpose by screening me, as I loitered, from farther remark;"
"while I took care, by posting myself in a doorway opposite the window,"
to make it easy for any one who expected me to find me.
And then I waited with my heart beating. The clocks were striking a
"half after seven when I took my place, and for a time I stood in a"
"ferment of excitement, now staring with bated breath at the casement,"
"where I had seen Marie, now scanning all the neighbouring doorways,"
and then again letting my eyes rove from window to window both of
Krapp's house and the next one on either side. As the latter were
"built with many quaint oriels, and tiny dormers, and had lattices in"
"side-nooks, where one least looked to find them, I was kept expecting"
"and employed. I was never quite sure, look where I would, what eyes"
were upon me.
"But little by little, as time passed and nothing happened, and the"
"strollers all went by without accosting me, and no faces save strange"
"ones showed at the windows, the heat of expectation left me. The chill"
of disappointment took its place. I began to doubt and fear. The
clocks struck eight. The sun had been down an hour. Half that time I
had been waiting.
"To remain passive was no longer bearable, and sick of caution, I"
"stepped out and began to walk up and down the street, courting rather"
than avoiding notice. The traffic was beginning to slacken. I could
see farther and mark people at a distance; but still no one spoke to
"me, no one came to me. Here and there lights began to shine in the"
"houses, on gleaming oak ceilings and carved mantels. The roofs were"
growing black against the paling sky. In nooks and corners it was
"dark. The half-hour sounded, and still I walked, fighting down doubt,"
boy; throughout the whole incident of the gentle lady whose fate melts
even the Vice to tears; and in the outburst of a mother's grief over her
child's corpse. We quote the last.
"O blissful babe, O joy of womb, heart's comfort and delight,"
"For counsel given unto the king, is this thy just requite?"
"O heavy day and doleful time, these mourning tunes to make!"
"With blubb'red eyes into my arms from earth I will thee take,"
And wrap thee in my apron white: but O my heavy heart!
"The spiteful pangs that it sustains would make it in two to part,"
"The death of this my son to see: O heavy mother now,"
That from thy sweet and sug'red joy to sorrow so shouldst bow!
What grief in womb did I retain before I did thee see;
"Yet at the last, when smart was gone, what joy wert thou to me!"
"How tender was I of thy food, for to preserve thy state!"
How stilled I thy tender heart at times early and late!
"With velvet paps I gave thee suck, with issue from my breast,"
And danced thee upon my knee to bring thee unto rest.
"Is this the joy of thee I reap? O king of tiger's brood,"
"O tiger's whelp, hadst thou the heart to see this child's heart-blood?"
"Nature enforceth me, alas, in this wise to deplore,"
"To wring my hands, O wel-away, that I should see this hour."
"Thy mother yet will kiss thy lips, silk-soft and pleasant white,"
With wringing hands lamenting for to see thee in this plight.
"My lording dear, let us go home, our mourning to augment."
"The second play, _Appius and Virginia_ (1563), by R.B. (not further"

put through tests which would have shown up at once any wires that had
been tampered with. After the shore party had cleared out about nine
"o'clock on the Thursday, no officer or man was allowed to leave the"
ship without a special permit from the Commander. This was all dead
"against the sanitary regulations of the harbour, but I had the"
"Admiral's authority to break any rules I pleased. By the way, you two"
ought never to have been allowed on board yesterday afternoon--I saw
"you, though you didn't see me; it was contrary to my orders. I spoke"
to the Admiral pretty sharp last night. 'Who is responsible for the
"ship?' says I. 'You or me?' 'You,' says he. 'I leave it at that,' says"
"I."""

"was it that I saw Petty Officer Trehayne in the ship?"""
"""He had orders to stay and keep watch--though he didn't know I was on"
"board myself. Two pairs of police eyes are better than one pair, and"
fifty times better than all the Navy eyes in the ship. Of all the
"simple-minded, unsuspicious beggars in the world, give me a pack of"
naval ratings! I wouldn't have one of them for sentries--that is why
"the fifty emergency Marines were sent for."" Dawson's limitless pride"
"in his old Service, and deep contempt for the mere sailor, had come"
back in full flood with the uniform of his Corps.
"""I started my own sentry duty in the dark corner I told you of as soon"
"as I had seen to the arrangements all over the _Malplaquet_, and I was"
"there, with very few breaks of not more than five minutes each for a"
"bite of food, for twenty-six hours. Two Marine sentries took my place"
"whenever I was away. I had my rifle and bayonet, and stood back in a"

"Erasmus never felt happy, was never content. This may perhaps surprise"
"us for a moment, when we think of his cheerful, never-failing energy, of"
his gay jests and his humour. But upon reflection this unhappy feeling
tallies very well with his character. It also proceeds from his general
attitude of warding off. Even when in high spirits he considers himself
"in all respects an unhappy man. 'The most miserable of all men, the"
"thrice-wretched Erasmus,' he calls himself in fine Greek terms. His life"
"'is an Iliad of calamities, a chain of misfortunes. How can anyone envy"
_me_?' To no one has Fortune been so constantly hostile as to him. She
"has sworn his destruction, thus he sang in his youth in a poetical"
complaint addressed to Gaguin: from earliest infancy the same sad and
hard fate has been constantly pursuing him. Pandora's whole box seems to
have been poured out over him.
This unhappy feeling takes the special form of his having been charged
"by unlucky stars with Herculean labour, without profit or pleasure to"
himself:[16] troubles and vexations without end. His life might have
been so much easier if he had taken his chances. He should never have
left Italy; or he ought to have stayed in England. 'But an immoderate
love of liberty caused me to wrestle long with faithless friends and
inveterate poverty.' Elsewhere he says more resignedly: 'But we are
driven by fate'.
That immoderate love of liberty had indeed been as fate to him. He had
always been the great seeker of quiet and liberty who found liberty late
"and quiet never. By no means ever to bind himself, to incur no"
obligations which might become fetters--again that fear of the
entanglements of life. Thus he remained the great restless one. He was
"never truly satisfied with anything, least of all with what he produced"
"himself. 'Why, then, do you overwhelm us with so many books', someone at"
He felt the tension of the muscles beneath him. Don Carlos was gathering
"himself together for the leap.  He would not fail, falter, or refuse."
The great mass seemed rushing up against him.  He felt the slackening
"with which Don Carlos faced his task, the motion of his flanks as he"
"took off and rose. Then what was it happened?  The sound of a click,"
"sharp and clear—a sickening sensation of falling, sinking, struggling,"
plunging.  Grey felt for a moment as though the end had come.  He and
his horse seemed falling into the very bowels of the earth. A black
shadow almost overhead showed him that the stallion had cleared the
"barrier, and the air was full of shouts, screams, cheers, and cries."
Next moment he felt strong hands lifting and dragging him upwards.
"Dick’s white face looked into his own, and the first words he heard were"
hissed in his ear by his faithful henchman.
"""Foul play, foul play, my master.  That ditch was dug and concealed—ay,"
"and more than concealed; it has been an old well at some time, and it"
will open with a spring.  You have been grossly tricked and cozened.  It
has been a trap cleverly laid and baited. But let me only get at them—my
"Lord Sandford—"""
"Dick almost choked in his fury; but Grey was now on his feet, and his"
"one thought was for the good horse, who had dropped downwards into this"
"unseen, unsuspected pit, and was gasping in affright, but might possibly"
"have escaped serious injury.  He himself felt little ill effects, having"
"had a marvellous escape.  But his soul was stirred within him, and in"
"getting out the horse he saw plainly that Dick had been right, and that"
some sort of old trap-door concealed an opening into the ground which
"might have been at one time a well, but was now silted up with sand.  By"
"luring the foremost rider to this particular spot to take the leap, any"
astute enemy aware of the nature of the ground could almost certainly
check-station; but we've told 'em over and over that we can't do any
better until they put a real computer on every ship and tell the
check-stations to report meteorites and other obstructions to us and
"then to let us alone. So you'd better recommend us some computers!"""
"""You're getting rotten computation, that's a sure thing, and I don't"
"blame you pilots for yelling, but I don't believe that you've got the"
right answer. I can't help but think that the astronomers are lying down
on the job. They are so sure that you pilots are to blame that it hasn't
"occurred to them to check up on themselves very carefully. However,"
"we'll know pretty quick, and then we'll take steps."""
"""I hope so--but say, Steve, I'm worried about using that much plus"
"equilibrium power. Remember, we've got to hit M14 in absolutely good"
"shape, or plenty heads will drop."""
"""I'll say they will. I know just how the passengers will howl if we"
"hold them weightless for half an hour, waiting for those two moons to get"
"out of the way, and I know just what the manager will do if we check in"
"minus thirty-one minutes. Wow! He'll swell up and bust, sure. But don't"
"worry, Breck--if we don't check in all right, anybody can have my head"
"that wants it, and I'm taking full responsibility, you know."""
"""You're welcome to it."" Breckenridge shrugged and turned the"
"conversation into a lighter vein. ""Speaking of weightlessness,"
"it's funny how many weight-fiends there are in the world, isn't"
it? You'd think the passengers would enjoy a little weightlessness
"occasionally--especially the fat ones--but they don't. But say, while"
"I think of it, how come you were here and loose to make this check-up?"
"I thought you were out with the other two of the Big Three, solving"
"all the mysteries of the Universe?"""
"the new light. Away to the left there is even a row of small houses,"
like a row of railway-mens' dwellings. Strange and familiar sight. And
the station precincts are disorderly and rather dilapidated. I think of
our Sicilian host.
"The brown woman gives us coffee, and very strong, rich goats' milk, and"
bread. After which the q-b and I set off once more along the road to the
village. She too is thrilled. She too breathes deep. She too feels
"_space_ around her, and freedom to move the limbs: such as one does not"
"feel in Italy and Sicily, where all is so classic and fixed."
"The village itself is just a long, winding, darkish street, in shadow,"
of houses and shops and a smithy. It might almost be Cornwall: not
"quite. Something, I don't know what, suggests the stark burning glare of"
"summer. And then, of course, there is none of the cosiness which"
climbing roses and lilac trees and cottage shops and haystacks would
"give to an English scene. This is harder, barer, starker, more dreary."
An ancient man in the black-and-white costume comes out of a hovel of a
cottage. The butcher carries a huge side of meat. The women peer at
us--but more furtive and reticent than the howling stares of Italy.
"So we go on, down the rough-cobbled street through the whole length of"
"the village. And emerging on the other side, past the last cottage, we"
"find ourselves again facing the open country, on the gentle down-slope"
"of the rolling hill. The landscape continues the same: low, rolling"
"upland hills, dim under the yellow sun of the January morning: stone"
"fences, fields, grey-arable land: a man slowly, slowly ploughing with a"
pony and a dark-red cow: the road trailing empty across the distance:
"and then, the one violently unfamiliar note, the enclosed cemetery lying"
"outside on the gentle hill-side, closed in all round, very compact,"
with high walls: and on the inside face of the enclosure wall the marble
"slabs, like shut drawers of the sepulchres, shining white, the wall"
it was rumoured that leave was going to start. How glorious it would be
to spend a sunny May or June in England!
Once a fortnight we paraded for our pay outside one of the bigger sheds
"of the yard. As a rule, I was filled with impatience and irritation at"
"having to wait in a long queue and move forward step by step, but now it"
"had become pleasant to tarry in the sunshine. One day, when we were"
"lined up between two large huts, a deep Yellow Brimstone butterfly came"
"floating idly past. It gave me inexpressible delight, a delight tempered"
by sadness and a longing for better times. I drew my pay and saluted
"perfunctorily, being unable and unwilling to think of anything but the"
"beauty of the sky, the sun, and the wonderful insect."
"I held my three ten-franc notes in my hand and thought: ""I _will_ enjoy"
this lovely day to the full. When we get back to camp I will do without
"the repulsive army fare, I will dine at the St. Martin and buy a bottle"
"of the best French wine, even if it costs me twenty francs. And then"
I'll walk to the little wood on the hill-slope and there I'll lie all
"the evening and dream or read a book."""
The whistle sounded. It was time to go back to work. But I cursed the
work and decided to take the small risk and remain idle for an hour or
two. I went to an outlying part of the yard and sat down on a patch of
long grass and leant back against a shed. The air was hot and several
bees flew by. Their buzzing reminded me of summer holidays spent in
"southern France before the war. I thought of vineyards and orchards, of"
"skies intensely blue, of scorching sunshine, of the tumultuous chirping"
"of cicadas and grasshoppers, and then of the tepid nights crowded with"
glittering stars and hushed except for the piping of tree-frogs.
Before the war--before the war--I repeated the words to myself. They
"conveyed a sense of immeasurable remoteness, of something gone and lost"
It was rather comical to see it. We were always climbing. And the line
"curved in great loops. So that as one looked out of the window, time and"
"again one started, seeing a little train running in front of us, in a"
"diverging direction, making big puffs of steam. But lo, it was our own"
little engine pelting off around a loop away ahead. We were quite a long
"train, but all trucks in front, only our two passenger coaches hitched"
on behind. And for this reason our own engine was always running fussily
"into sight, like some dog scampering in front and swerving about us,"
while we followed at the tail end of the thin string of trucks.
I was surprised how well the small engine took the continuous steep
"slopes, how bravely it emerged on the sky-line. It is a queer railway. I"
would like to know who made it. It pelts up hill and down dale and round
"sudden bends in the most unconcerned fashion, not as proper big railways"
"do, grunting inside deep cuttings and stinking their way through"
"tunnels, but running up the hill like a panting, small dog, and having a"
"look round, and starting off in another direction, whisking us behind"
unconcernedly. This is much more fun than the tunnel-and-cutting system.
They told me that Sardinia mines her own coal: and quite enough for her
"own needs: but very soft, not fit for steam-purposes. I saw heaps of it:"
"small, dull, dirty-looking stuff. Truck-loads of it too. And"
truck-loads of grain.
"At every station we were left ignominiously planted, while the little"
engines--they had gay gold names on their black little bodies--strolled
"about along the side-lines, and snuffed at the various trucks. There we"
"sat, at every station, while some truck was discarded and some other"
"sorted out like a branded sheep, from the sidings and hitched on to us."
"It took a long time, this did."
by melting bits of lead. With his primitive weapon with the entreaties
of his villagers ringing in his ears Kaloo Singh started on his perilous
journey. At midday I was startled by the groanings of some animals in
pain. The tigress had sprung among a herd of buffalo and with successive
strokes of its mighty paws had killed two buffaloes and left them in the
field. Kaloo Singh waited there for the return of the tigress to the
kill. There was not a tree near by; only there was a low bush behind
which he lay crouched. After hours of waiting as the sun was going down
he was taken aback by the sudden apparition of the tigress which stood
within six feet of him. His limbs had become half paralysed from cold
and his crouching position. Trying to raise his gun he could take no aim
as his arm was shaking with involuntary fear. Kaloo Singh explained to
"me afterwards how he succeeded in shaking off his mortal terror. ""I"
"quietly said to myself, Kaloo Singh, Kaloo Singh, who sent you here? Did"
not the villagers put their trust on you! I could then no longer lie in
"hiding, and I stood up and something strange and invigorating crept up"
strength into my body. All the trembling went and I became as hard as
steel. The tigress had seen me and with eyes blazing crouched for the
spring lashing its tail. Only six feet lay between. She sprang and my
gun also went off at the same time and she missed her aim and fell dead
"close to me."" That was how a common villager went off to meet death at"
the call of something for which he could give no name and the mother
and wife of Kaloo Singh had also bidden him go. There are millions of
Kaloo Singhs with mother and sisters and wife to send them forth. And
you too have many loved ones who would themselves bid you arm for the
defence of your homes.
DIFFERENCE OF TEMPERAMENT
"The issue is clear, and immediate action is imperative. But action is"
delayed by misunderstanding arising out of temperamental differences
reeking exhalations of linoleum and mildewed and rotten woodwork.
"Then, suddenly, as he rested there, the room was filled with the"
"strong, sweet odour of mignonette. It came as upon a single buffet of"
wind with such sureness and fragrance and emphasis that it almost
"seemed a living visitant. And the man cried aloud: “What, dear?” as if"
"he had been called, and sprang up and faced about. The rich odour clung"
"to him and wrapped him around. He reached out his arms for it, all his"
senses for the time confused and commingled. How could one be
"peremptorily called by an odour? Surely it must have been a sound. But,"
"was it not the sound that had touched, that had caressed him?"
"“She has been in this room,” he cried, and he sprang to wrest from it a"
"token, for he knew he would recognize the smallest thing that had"
belonged to her or that she had touched. This enveloping scent of
"mignonette, the odour that she had loved and made her own—whence came"
it?
The room had been but carelessly set in order. Scattered upon the
"flimsy dresser scarf were half a dozen hairpins—those discreet,"
"indistinguishable friends of womankind, feminine of gender, infinite of"
"mood and uncommunicative of tense. These he ignored, conscious of their"
triumphant lack of identity. Ransacking the drawers of the dresser he
"came upon a discarded, tiny, ragged handkerchief. He pressed it to his"
face. It was racy and insolent with heliotrope; he hurled it to the
"floor. In another drawer he found odd buttons, a theatre programme, a"
"pawnbroker’s card, two lost marshmallows, a book on the divination of"
"dreams. In the last was a woman’s black satin hair bow, which halted"
"him, poised between ice and fire. But the black satin hair-bow also is"
"femininity’s demure, impersonal, common ornament, and tells no tales."
"And then he traversed the room like a hound on the scent, skimming the"
just see by the night-light's glow.  The afternoon had shaken her nerves.
Nor was Betty's method of breathing while asleep conducive to the slumber
"of anything but babies.  It was so hot, too, and the sound of the violin"
"still in her ears.  By that little air of Poise, she had known for"
certain it was Fiorsen; and her father's abrupt drawing of the curtains
"had clinched that certainty.  If she had gone to the window and seen him,"
she would not have been half so deeply disturbed as she was by that echo
of an old emotion.  The link which yesterday she thought broken for good
was reforged in some mysterious way.  The sobbing of that old fiddle had
"been his way of saying, ""Forgive me; forgive!""  To leave him would have"
been so much easier if she had really hated him; but she did not.
"However difficult it may be to live with an artist, to hate him is quite"
as difficult.  An artist is so flexible--only the rigid can be hated.
"She hated the things he did, and him when he was doing them; but"
"afterward again could hate him no more than she could love him, and that"
was--not at all.  Resolution and a sense of the practical began to come
"back with daylight.  When things were hopeless, it was far better to"
recognize it and harden one's heart.
"Winton, whose night had been almost as sleepless--to play like a beggar"
"in the street, under his windows, had seemed to him the limit!--announced"
"at breakfast that he must see his lawyer, make arrangements for the"
"payment of Fiorsen's debts, and find out what could be done to secure Gyp"
against persecution.  Some deed was probably necessary; he was vague on
"all such matters.  In the meantime, neither Gyp nor the baby must go out."
"Gyp spent the morning writing and rewriting to Monsieur Harmost, trying"
"to express her chagrin, but not saying that she had left Fiorsen."
Her father came back from Westminster quiet and angry.  He had with
"difficulty been made to understand that the baby was Fiorsen's property,"
"so that, if the fellow claimed it, legally they would be unable to"
"resist.  The point opened the old wound, forced him to remember that his"
"must soon! It is a short start, and half of us on foot!'"
"No one answered, but in a moment we had the Waldgrave, my lady,"
"Fraulein, and one of the women mounted. Then we put up Marie, who was"
"no heavier than a feather, and the lighter of the women on the"
"remaining horse; and Steve hurrying beside the leader, and I, Ernst,"
"and Jacob bringing up the rear, we were well on the road within two"
minutes of the appearance of the horses. Those who rode had only
sacking for saddles and loops of rope for stirrups; but no one
"complained. Even Fraulein Max began to recover herself, and to dwell"
more upon the peril of capture than on aching legs and chafed knees.
"The road was good, and we made, as far as I could judge, about six"
miles in the first hour. This placed us nine miles from the camp; the
"time, a little after midnight. At this point the clouds, which had"
"aided us so far by increasing the darkness of the night, fell in a"
"great storm of rain, that, hissing on the road and among the trees, in"
a few minutes drenched us to the skin. But no one complained. Steve
muttered that it would make it the more difficult to track us; and for
"another hour we plodded on gallantly. Then our leader called a halt,"
and we stood listening.
"The rain had left the sky lighter. A waning moon, floating in a wrack"
"of watery clouds to westward, shed a faint gleam on the landscape. To"
"the right of us it disclosed a bare plain, rising gradually as it"
"receded, and offering no cover. On our left, between us and the river,"
it was different. Here a wilderness of osiers--a grey willow swamp
that in the moonlight shimmered like the best Utrecht--stretched as
"far as we could see. The road where we stood rose a few feet above it,"
so that our eyes were on a level with the highest shoots; but a
hundred yards farther on the road sank a little. We could see the
"water standing on the track in pools, and glimmering palely."

"though--the M.O. didn't 'alf give me a tellin' orf. Jesus Christ, didn't"
I 'ave the wind up when we went up the line! An' now I'm scared at the

"""That's a bloody fact. When we first come out, I thought all the Belgian"
civvies a lot o' bloody cowards takin' cover whenever Fritz came over.

the old soldiers what's the worst o' the lot for wanglin' out o' risky
"jobs."""
"""Napoleon was right,"" observed a small, red-haired lance-corporal, whose"
"remarks generally had a sardonic touch, ""when he said the worse the man"
the better the soldier. It's only people who have no imagination and no
intelligence who are courageous in modern war. Nobody with any sense
would expose himself unnecessarily and rush a machine-gun position or do
"the sort of thing they give you a V.C. for. Of course, there are a few"
"cases where it's deserved, and it isn't always the one who deserves it"
"that gets it. I'm quite certain the refined, sensitive, imaginative kind"
of man is no good as a soldier. He may be able to control himself better
than the others at first--educated people are used to self-control--but
in the long run his nerves will give way sooner. Moral courage is a
"thing I admire more than anything, but there's no use for it in the"
"army, in fact it's worse than useless in the army. The man who's too"
went to one of these islands where many deer were to be found and set
"fire to the grass to drive them out of cover, shooting them as they came"
"out. Some deer, fleeing before the fire, swam across and escaped, others"
"fell victims, but one fawn, barely half grown, ran right down the"
"island, and in its blind terror it leaped into a boat at anchor there."
This boat was that of a fisherman who was plying his trade at some
"distance, and the only occupant of the boat was his wife. Now this woman"
"had a year or so before lost her son, very much loved by her, but who"
"was not quite of the best character, and when she saw the deer leaping"
"into the boat, she at once fancied that she saw the soul of her erring"
son looking at her out of its great terrified eyes. So she got up and
"took the poor panting beast in her arms and soothed it, and when the"
"hunters came running to her to claim it she refused. 'He is my son,' she"
"said, 'he is mine. Shall I give him up to death?' The hunters clamoured"
"and threatened to take the deer by force, but the woman was quite firm."
"She would never give him up except with her life. 'You can see,' she"
"said, 'that it is true that he is my son. He came running straight to"
"me, as he always did in his trouble when he was a boy, and he is now"
"quite quiet and contented, instead of being afraid of me as an ordinary"
"deer would be.' And it was quite true that the deer took to her at once,"
and remained with her willingly. So the hunters went off to the court of
the governor and filed a suit for the deer.
"The case was tried in open court, and the deer was produced with a"
ribbon round its neck. Evidence there was naturally but little. The
hunters claimed the deer because they had driven it out of the island by
their fire. The woman resisted the claim on the ground that it was her
son.
The decision of the court was this:
'The hunters are not entitled to the deer because they cannot prove that
"Redditch seemed to dance up and down me, but I stuck it out--and I had"
"my reward, I had my reward. I did my duty, but it's a sick and sorry"
"man that I am this day."""
"""There was nothing else to be done,"" I said. ""What you feel now is a"
"nervous reaction."""
"""That's about it. I watched and watched, never feeling a bit like"
sleep though my eyes burned something cruel and my feet--they were
"lumps of prickly wood, not feet. Dull lumps with every now and then a"
stab as if a tin tack had been driven into them. Beyond me in the open
"alley-way the light was strong, and I could see men pass frequently,"
"but no one came into my corner till the end, and no one saw me. I"
"heard six bells go in the first watch ('Eleven p.m.,' whispered Cary)"
"on Friday evening, though there was a good bit of noise of getting"
"ready to go out in the early morning, and I was beginning to think"
"that all my trouble might go for naught, when a man in a Navy cap and"
overalls stopped just opposite my dark hole between two bulkheads. His
"face was turned from me, as he looked carefully up and down the"
"lighted way. He stood there quite still for some seconds, and then"
stepped backwards towards me. I could see him plain against the light
"beyond. He listened for another minute or so, and, satisfied that no"
"one was near, spun on his heels, whipped a tool from his dungaree"
"overalls, and reached up to the wires which ran under the deck beams"
overhead. In spite of my aching joints and sore feet I was out in a
flash and had my bayonet up against his chest. He didn't move till my
point was through his clothes and into his flesh. I just shoved till
"he gave ground, and so, step by step, I pushed him with the point of"
"my bayonet till he was under the lights. His arms had come down, he"
dropped the big shears with insulated handles which he had drawn from
"his pocket, but he didn't speak a word to me and I did not speak to"
"him. I just held him there under the lights, and we looked at one"
"When Winton had left him, an hour and a half later that afternoon,"
"Fiorsen continued to stand at the front door, swaying his body to and"
fro.  The brandy-nurtured burst of jealousy which had made him insult his
wife and old Monsieur Harmost had died suddenly when Gyp turned on him in
"the street and spoke in that icy voice; since then he had felt fear,"
increasing every minute.  Would she forgive?  To one who always acted on
"the impulse of the moment, so that he rarely knew afterward exactly what"
"he had done, or whom hurt, Gyp's self-control had ever been mysterious"
and a little frightening. Where had she gone?  Why did she not come in?
"Anxiety is like a ball that rolls down-hill, gathering momentum.  Suppose"
she did not come back!  But she must--there was the baby--their baby!
"For the first time, the thought of it gave him unalloyed satisfaction."
"He left the door, and, after drinking a glass to steady him, flung"
"himself down on the sofa in the drawing-room. And while he lay there, the"
"brandy warm within him, he thought: 'I will turn over a new leaf; give up"
"drink, give up everything, send the baby into the country, take Gyp to"
"Paris, Berlin, Vienna, Rome--anywhere out of this England, anywhere, away"
"from that father of hers and all these stiff, dull folk!  She will like"
"that--she loves travelling!'  Yes, they would be happy!  Delicious"
nights--delicious days--air that did not weigh you down and make you feel
that you must drink--real inspiration--real music!  The acrid wood-smoke
"scent of Paris streets, the glistening cleanness of the Thiergarten, a"
"serenading song in a Florence back street, fireflies in the summer dusk"
at Sorrento--he had intoxicating memories of them all!  Slowly the warmth
"of the brandy died away, and, despite the heat, he felt chill and"
"shuddery.  He shut his eyes, thinking to sleep till she came in.  But"
"very soon he opened them, because--a thing usual with him of late--he saw"
"such ugly things--faces, vivid, changing as he looked, growing ugly and"
"uglier, becoming all holes--holes--horrible holes--Corruption--matted,"
"twisted, dark human-tree-roots of faces!  Horrible!  He opened his eyes,"
"for when he did that, they always went.  It was very silent.  No sound"
"But the dog only made a splash in the water with her paws, and then"
"turned and ran after me. The boatmen laughed and resumed their poling,"
and I passed on. In the still morning across the still water I could
"hear every word, but I hardly took any note; I have heard it so often."
Only now when I come to write on this subject do I remember.
It has been inculcated in us from childhood that it is a manly thing to
"be indifferent to pain--not to our own pain only, but to that of all"
"others. To be sorry for a hunted hare, to compassionate the wounded"
"deer, to shrink from torturing the brute creation, has been accounted by"
"us as namby-pamby sentimentalism, not fit for man, fit only for a"
squeamish woman. To the Burman it is one of the highest of all virtues.
He believes that all that is beautiful in life is founded on compassion
and kindness and sympathy--that nothing of great value can exist without
"them. Do you think that a Burmese boy would be allowed to birds'-nest,"
"or worry rats with a terrier, or go ferreting? Not so. These would be"
crimes.
That this kindness and compassion for animals has very far-reaching
"results no one can doubt. If you are kind to animals, you will be kind,"
"too, to your fellow-man. It is really the same thing, the same feeling"
in both cases. If to be superior in position to an animal justifies you
"in torturing it, so it would do with men. If you are in a better"
"position than another man, richer, stronger, higher in rank, that"
would--that does often in our minds--justify ill-treatment and contempt.
Our innate feeling towards all that we consider inferior to ourselves is
scorn; the Burman's is compassion. You can see this spirit coming out in
"every action of their daily life, in their dealings with each other, in"
"their thoughts, in their speech. 'You are so strong, have you no"
"compassion for him who is weak, who is tempted, who has fallen?' How"
often have I heard this from a Burman's lips! How often have I seen him
"refusal of Buddhists to take life. 'Buddhists,' they say, 'believe in"
the transmigration of souls. They believe that when a man dies his soul
"may go into a beast. You could not expect him to kill a bull, when"
perchance his grandfather's soul might inhabit there.' This is their
"explanation, this is the way they put two and two together to make five."
"They know that Buddhists believe in transmigration, they know that"
"Buddhists do not like to take life, and therefore one is the cause of"
the other.
I have mentioned this explanation to Burmans while talking of the
"subject, and they have always laughed at it. They had never heard of it"
before. It is true that it is part of their great theory of life that
"the souls of men have risen from being souls of beasts, and that we may"
so relapse if we are not careful. Many stories are told of cases that
"have occurred where a man has been reincarnated as an animal, and where"
what is now the soul of a man used to live in a beast. But that makes no
"difference. Whatever a man may have been, or may be, he is a man now;"
"whatever a beast may have been, he is a beast now. Never suppose that a"
"Burman has any other idea than this. To him men are men, and animals are"
"animals, and men are far the higher. But he does not deduce from this"
that man's superiority gives him permission to illtreat or to kill
animals. It is just the reverse. It is because man is so much higher
than the animal that he can and must observe towards animals the very
"greatest care, feel for them the very greatest compassion, be good to"
them in every way he can. The Burman's motto should be _Noblesse
"oblige_; he knows the meaning, if he knows not the words."
For the Burman's compassion towards animals goes very much farther than
a mere reluctance to kill them. Although he has no command on the
"subject, it seems to him quite as important to treat animals well during"
their lives as to refrain from taking those lives. His refusal to take
life he shares with the Hindu; his perpetual care and tenderness to all
"able to talk. But you must leave this place."" The girl said: ""Then I"
would rather be the most beautiful of maidens without the power of
"speech""--and such she became, but from that time on she was dumb."
"Now when the girl had left her foster-mother, and had wandered for a"
"time, she came to a large, large wood, and no matter how far she went"
"she could not reach its end. When evening came, she climbed into a high"
"tree that stood over a spring, and sat down in its branches to sleep."
"Not far from it stood a king's castle, and early the next morning a"
"serving-maid came from it, to get water from the spring for the prince's"
"tea. And when the serving-maid saw the lovely face in the spring, she"
thought it was her own. At once she threw down her pail and ran back
"home holding her head high, and saying: ""If I am as beautiful as all"
"that, I am too good to carry water in a pail!"" Then another was sent to"
"fetch water, but the same thing happened with her; she, too, came back"
and said she was far too handsome and too good to go to the spring and
"fetch water for the prince. Then the prince went himself, for he wanted"
"to see what it all meant. And when he came to the spring, he also saw"
"the picture, and at once looked up into the tree. And so he saw the"
"lovely maiden who was seated among its branches. He coaxed her down,"
"took her back home with him, and nothing would do but that she must be"
"his bride, because she was so beautiful. But his mother, who was still"
"living, objected: ""She cannot speak,"" said she, ""and, maybe, she"
"belongs to the troll-folk."" But the prince would not be satisfied until"
"he had won her. When, after a time, heaven bestowed a child upon the"
"queen, the prince set a strong guard about her. But suddenly they all"
"fell asleep, and her foster-mother came, cut the child's little finger,"
"rubbed some of the blood over the mouth and hands of the queen, and"
"said: ""Now you shall grieve just as I did when you let the star slip"
"out!"" And with that she disappeared with the child. When those whom the"
"prince had set to keep guard opened their eyes again, they thought that"
"the queen had devoured her child, and the old queen wanted to have her"

Everything's gone!
Don't unnecessarily get tensed.
We have to catch her now.
That is important.
Okay.

"And presumably, Bath..."
But that doesn't work.
That doesn't work.
You haven't found the right answers.
I'm going to throw it over to Araucarians for a bonus point?
We think it's Beaufort and Minton.
"Beaufort and Minton, show me your first letters."
Let's see if you're right?
I know you're not.
It is Beaufort and Badminton.

Should I call the boss for you?
"Don't piss me off, I've a gun."
I just got dumped.
"Let me remind you, there are CCTV cameras."
Cover your face.
The price tag is still on your toy gun.
Don't come over!
Don't come over!

Lucky.

You're under arrest.
What underwear?
You're officially under arrest.
"I'm Inspector Mak Ho-Man, Michael Mak."
Shit!
Shit?
Shit?

Congrats!
Solved another big case!
More like a ridiculous case...
Money means nothing to these rich playboys.
Michael!
You did it again!
Where should we celebrate?
I've reserved a table at a good toro Japanese restaurant.
Expensive but I know you won't mind.
I'm not going.
You guys go ahead.
Why?
"Oh, hello, Mr. Mason."
"When I call you last night-- uh, meet Lieutenant Anderson."
We've met.
"You Mr. Norstaad's lawyer, Perry?"
"No, no, not for this."
For something else.
This morning I forget to call you and tell you I do not need appointment anymore.
But it is all right.
You send me bill anyway.
And now you turn around and go back.
Goodbye.
"Well, Axel, as long as I'm already here--"
"No, no, no, you're such a busy man."
We don't want to keep you.
Goodbye.
"Goodbye, Perry."
"All right, Axel."
"Good luck, Andy."
What's the matter?
They stop serving?
Mm-mm.
Floyd Chapman's over there.
"All right, let's have a meeting of the Bar Association."
Perry.
What on earth?
"Hello, Miss Street."
- Hello.
"- Well, Counselor."
[both] What are you doing here?
I'm afraid I can't answer that satisfactorily.
Can you?
Don't see why not.
It's the sign of Solon.
MacGyver... it's...the Ark... of Solon.
Oh...
Oh...
It looks so beautiful.
"Yeah, it's gorgeous."
Now can we get it and us out of here?
But just think.
Inside this Ark rests the Torch of Truth.
"Ah, yes."
"""Gods march in rank."""
Yes!
Yes.
"""And Hecate races in the heavens,"
"""enters the gates of Hades,"
"""and the Book shall summon the power of the ancient ones."
"""Offer the Torch of Truth to the Temple of Ages, and the Treasure of Atlantis...shall rise."""
It's the riddle of Solon.
Great!
Now can we go?
You are going nowhere.
What?
What is it?
Ah!
Tell me who you were spying for.
United Nations?
U.S. Intelligence?
Who?
We're not spies.
"Ah, yes, you are, uh historians."
Historians?
I happen to be a professor of archaeology.
You said that.
Mr. Aaronson.
"Hello, Nicholas."
Did you see your dad outside?
"Yes, I did."
"Mr. Aaronson, uh... about Sarah--"
Sarah?
Your child.
is there anyone that can take care of her?
She's with a nanny.
"Well, legally, the biological father has rights."
He does?
Legally.
But I'm prepared to help you if you--
What?
If you wish to keep her.
Oh.
No.
"Thank you, no."
Have you met the father?
She said they were just friends.
I even gave him a job at one of my stores.
I gave that guy a job.
"Oh, Alvin?"
I'm on my way to the track.
"I'm up _3,OOO so far-- an astonishing run."
"Alvin, understand that if you choose not to do your job, then I will have to--"
- What?
Fire me?
- Yes.
"I've already been fired, Lulu, trust me."
I'm already dead to this place.

Locked and loaded.
"Oh, my baby, I'm so sorry."
- Stop the car.
- Hogarth!
"My God, honey, you're all right."
Go back!
We've gotta help him!
"Are you crazy, kid?"
You're lucky to be alive!
We're taking you to a hospital.
(SOLDIERS YELLING)
SOLDIER 2:
Everyone!
Out of the car!
We're evacuating the area.
What are you talking about?
We gotta get this boy to a hospital.
What boy?

"Hogarth, no!"

Hey!
No!
Stop!
This is General Rogard.
Ready the attack and prepare to retreat to the fallback position.
No!
No!
He raised me.
"I want to graduate, find a good job, and repay my Grandpa."
Hey.
Kick me.
Come on.
With all your might.
Are you OK?
Your posture is good.
You can learn ShaoIin Kung Fu.
Why ShaoIin Kung Fu?
I want to spread the art of Shaolin.
It was my Grandpa's dream.
OK...
I can try.
really?
If you try Iacrosse.
Alright!
Yeah!
Come!
Wait!

Going to countdown to the New Year there.

"Come on, Carol."
You have everything.
You are so successful.
Hire a maid to do all these chores.
I can afford ten maids.
But one achieves success with..
"..patience, honesty and hard work."
That's why I do these small household chores.
It's not my job.
Even in Jaipur my servants do all this.
I have come to Mumbai to be very famous.
And in this small life I have many great things to do.
I have to go far ahead.

How are you?
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

Alicia was her pupil.
And Katerina loves her like a daughter.

Hey.
Move aside.

- Moron?
- Look at his face.
Do you love Shiv?
Yes.
Do you want to marry him?
Yes.
Yes!
Don't be mad.
He has an entire army with him.
The Boss announces a contract... to get Shiv and Ankita married.
But Boss how can you start the contract... without advance money?
This is against your system.
- You're right.
- Yes.

I was in this room.
And it was red.

"And these curtains, they were on fire."
And I was in this corner.

"Uh, we were being audited, actually."
"But yes-- once again, my job forced a last-minute change of plans."
But not tonight.
No.
"We are spending the holiday in Turks and Caicos with Jake's family, no matter what."
"You better get going, then."

"Jake, yeah."
How you doing?

Wow.
I'm good.
"Um, listen, I can't thank you enough for what you've meant to Ellie this past year."
All of you.
She's earned it.
"Turks, huh?"

Yeah.
"Uh, the country Turkey might have been a little too on the nose."
How do you f eel?
Better.

"Have a good show, everybody."
"She likes you in the elevator, then she pr etends like she doesn't know you?"

- I don't think she's playing hard to get.
I think she has no inter est in me at all.
Got to r espect her f or that.
"I don't even know her, and -- no joke --"

- I r eally like her.

"He'll be here, promise."
"-Where is he, anyway?"
-On business.
-That's why you ran away.
-I was going to college.
"It was Dad who said if I was gonna go, I should stay gone."
"Your brother and me, we needed you."
"You walked away, Sam."
-You walked away.
DEAN:
Stop it.
You're the one who said don't come back.
"You closed that door, not me!"
This isn't the life I wanted for you.

"All right, then."
"Well, Zelda, baby, how is everything?"
What?
"Just, you know, wondering how everything is?"
"You are so bad at faking' things, Mama."
"You know, don't you?"
"I have high blood pressure, I can't take this."
Shame on you!
Inspector!
No toothbrush.
But we found 2 pineapples.
Where from?
From them!
"Help me get rid of them, quick!"
"- Get rid of them, sure!"
- Yes.
I meant the pineapples!
Inspector!
Inspector Robin!
I've been waiting for you!
For me?
What for?
- To be friends with you!
- Friends?
Do you mind if I sit on your bed?
Not at all.
You can do anything you like on my bed.
"Make yourself at home, feel free!"
I'm a very easy-going person!
- Inspector Robin!
- Just call me Robin!
"Robin, I want to...!"
What do you want to do with me?
I want to chat with you!
O.K. let's talk while we're still sober.
"Robin, I...!"
"Control yourself, Bridget!"
- Can I have a drink!
See you then.
"Dennis, I have an idea."
"- Well, this is awesome."
- Yeah.
This is amazing.
There's blood everywhere.
It's beautiful.
"Yeah, and we were totally right."
These guys don't have technique.
They get all cranked up like animals and beat the Christ out of each other.
Look at all this money being thrown around.
"- Dude, we gotta get in on this."
"- Oh, yeah."
"- Really, I think it's about who can take the biggest beating."
- Yeah.
Get up!
You know who can take a really good beating?
- Charlie.
- Charlie.
Here she is...
The old gym.
Smell that?
- That's the smell of hard work.
- And feet.
That's the smell of big dreams.
The smell of glory.
- It smells like feet.
- And feet.
Does smell like feet.
- Frank?
"- Oh, shit."
Frankie Fast Hands!
"Carry on, Mr. Scott-Padget."
Officer has reported with all equipment correct.
Thank you.
Small chance of a convoy still being here.
- Any change in course?
- Not yet.
Sail ho!
"Deck, there!"
"Large sail, two points forward of the larboard beam!"
- What is she?
Can you tell?
"- She's a frigate, sir."
"Hear that, Mr. Scott-Padget?"
A single frigate.
- Beat to quarters.
"- Aye, aye."
Beat to quarters!
They think it's a safe road.
We'll run with her.
Bring us to nor'- nor'west.
"Aye, aye, sir."
Steer nor'- nor'west!
- Number one ready!
- Two!
- Three ready!
- Four!
- Five!
- All guns ready!
Fighting lanterns ready.
Gun ports closed.
- She's Venetian.
"- Neutral, then?"
What do you mean?
There's something very strange about him.
"God, I don't know how to explain it."
At first I thought it was just a crush.
But...
I think that Mikey's in love with me.
He's only nine years old.
"He's not normal nine-year-old, Rachel!"
"Jessie, you're upset."
You've had a huge shock.
Rachel!
"Would you listen to me, please?"
- Mikey said stuff.
- What stuff?
That David was being punished for killing Rosie and that now I could love only him.
I think that he killed David.
Jessie--
"Rachel, listen to me!"
Your son is dangerous!
"If there's something wrong with Mikey,"
Neil and I will deal with it.
RACHEL:
I know we have to talk with Mikey.
We'll decide what to do then.
"I'm sorry, Jessie."
( Dial Tone )
Did you get my fax yet?
"Oh, yeah."
It's right here.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
Electrocuted?
He's everything they say he is.
"What about you, Sal?"
Are you everything they say you are?
I'll be a son of a bitch.

[Door Alarm Buzzes]
Come on!
Thank you.
Hello.
This is Doyle.
I'm sittin' on Frog One.
"Yeah, I know that."
We got the Westbury covered like a tent.
"The Westbury, my ass!"
I got him on the shuttle at Grand Central.
"Now, what the hell's goin' on up there?"
"I make him coming out of the hotel, free as a bird."
There wasn't a soul awake.
What the hell are you talking about?
"Yeah, well, uh-"
"Listen, I don't care how many bartenders you got that are sick."
"Nah, I'm not workin' that joint."
That's right.
"Same to you, buddy."
Can I get a grape drink?
- [Man On Speaker] Watch the closing doors.
- [Alarm Buzzing]
You son of a bitch!
Hi.
"Can I have a, uh, round-trip ticket to Washington?"
- Washington?
"Now, let's go!"
- Good!
"- Luth, let's go home early!"
- Why not?
It only takes one!
"I tell you, Tiny, you got to let him in on it!"
There's no percentage in smartening up a chump!
- But what if he gets in a lucky punch?
- Stick to your buckets!
I'll do the thinking!
"- You ready, Stoker?"
- Never felt better!
Good!
Let's go!
"Looks like we get home early, all right!"
"Hey, why don't you stop that?"
Cheating on yourself!
Good crowd!
Make a showing and you're in!
- Watch out!
- What did I tell you?
- I knew I could take him!
"- Nice going, Luth!"
- Thanks!
- Swell fight!
"Hey, Stoker!"
!
good luck!
"Don't go home yet, folks!"
There's another bout coming!
"And don't forget, Friday night is wrestling night!"
The Lithuanian Angel against the Masked Mastodon!
Thank you very much!
"Hey, excuse me?"
"What it is, bro`!"
We`re from out of town.
No shit?
I`d really appreciate it if you could give me directions back onto the expressway.
What?
For free?
Sure.
Five dollars.
I`m not going to give you $5 for directions!
"I think that`s fair, clark."
Okay.
Here`s $10.
Keep the change.
You see which way you`re pointing?
You see that place?
"You see where it says, ""Rib Tips""?"
Fuck that.
You don`t want to go that way.
I wonder if these guys know The Commodores.
You go down about half a block and you`II see a Torino with no wheels on it.
"Inside that Torino is my cousin, Jackie."
"tell him that you`re my boy, and you`re lost."
He`II make sure you get where you`re going.
You don`t want to know from me.
This ain`t my neighborhood.
"I`m from the west side of Chicago, here on vacation."
Thanks a Iot.
You`ve been a great help.
"""I`m Mister Blue"
"""When you say you love me.... """
Is this why you disappeared every other day?
No no I...
I snatched your power.
Next you attack my father...
I'll pull the earth from under your feet.
And this isn't just a statement... it's the Boss' prediction.
Boss!
Ankita has to come sir.
Shivani is a common friend.
And her mom's in the ICU.
She's in a state of shock.
So I thought if Ankita just met Shivani once... she will feel better.
And anyway I couldn't contact Ankita earlier.
So I had to come here.
Okay.
Take her along.
But...
You will bring Ankita back home... sooner than Shivani's mother's eager to die.
Okay sir.
I...
I'll bring her back home soon.
Go.
Hurry up Dimple.
Poor Shivani...
What happened?
I'm taking you to Shiv not Shivani.
What?
Shivani's mom is alright.
Now call him.
Here's my phone.
- Shiv.
- Ankita how are you?
"Allah, I will never die."
You can't kill me.
(HELICOPTER APPROACHING)
I'm sorry too.
Clare...
Come on.
MAN:
"Clare, Clare, come with me."
Keep your head down.
Get in.
Tell me you got it.
He gave her the name of the spy before he died.
I'll be right back.
- So you got your car then?
- Yes.
- And your money?
- Thank you.
And you are sure no one will come and look for it?
No.
"You've earned it, it's yours."
We are business partners now.
Jacoub and Sons.
(SPEAKING IN SUDANESE ARABIC)
"Yeah, I will beat you for your rudeness."
(SPEAKING IN SUDANESE ARABIC)
- (SPEAKING IN SUDANESE ARABIC)
"- Now, go."
"You want to put away the Pulitzer for a minute, come back here?"
"Doctor's orders, sweetie."
Can't get you too excited.
I promise I'll make it worth your while.
"What's the matter, sweetie?"
- You've reached the voice mail...
"- Em, pick up the phone."
Can't tell where it's coming from.
I have no visual on him.
Ten-four.
Still have them on...?
No.
- Clear!
- Clear!
"Negative, negative."
Snipers on the roof.
Do not approach Castle.
"Repeat, do not approach Castle."
Do not advance.
Do not advance.
Say what?
"Welcome to the White House, Mr. Tyler."
I love what you've done with the place.
Bullet holes add to the decor.
Did you see that shit Conrad pulled off at the Capitol?
Goddamn!
Let's keep it tight.
Get to work.
Where are my goddamn hostages?
- Dad?
"-Oh, thank God."
"- Emily, are you okay?"
- Dad--
"Look, it's gonna be okay, baby, I promise you."
- Where are you?
- Where are you at?
I'll come get you.
Oooh...
That was a delayed one.
Nice.
Hm-m-m.
(gunfire)
(woman screams)
(gunfire)
We're doomed.
"Hi, Daddy..."
Dad.
"Sorry, son."
I can't save us.
I don't have the energy.
"Wait, my pills!"
"Junior, would you reach in my anus?"
Sure!
"Wait, let me check my pocket first."
(groans)
(gun cocks)
Any last puns or wordplay?
"You've heard of pirating cable, but how about cabling a pirate?"
You have defeated us.
Have I?
Yes!
Ugh!
I hate you!
Do you?
Ahh!
(ship's horn blares)
"Cleveland, you really saved the day."
Maybe I was wrong about you taking those pills.
"I hope so, 'cause I haven't stopped."
- And so are you.
"Officer Hauser,the twin tree... any leads?"
Not yet.But I'm working on it.
- Day and night.
"- Well,I'm here to help."
In those shoes?
"Well,I thought we could start with you asking me to dinner."
I found the twin tree.
And Petty's last bomb.
So much death from something so small.
You know her methods?
Fix her.
Alcatraz Season 1 Episode 6
Previously on Alcatraz...
Meet the '63s.
The worst criminals this country has ever known are coming back.
My grandfather wasn't a guard.
He was an inmate.
That's him.
"Tommy Madsen, he killed my partner."
Police.
So we have to find these '63s?
We need to find who took them.
I need you to watch them.
"You know, they're not so bad."
"Lucy, get down!"
Welcome to Alcatraz...
Dr. Sengupta.
"Thank you, Warden James."
"I don't know, Hauser."
Maybe the pirate life ain't for you.
Ah.
The little girl must be her.
Her?
Her.
[ Sam ] She's dead.
"Melvin, you should've been a detective instead of a mortician."
[ Man ] It was the saddest thing-- finding her purse... sittin' on top of a neatly folded coat out there at the end of the dock.
Hmm.
She drowned herself?
I found this shoe floating' under the dock.
Guess the other one sunk to the bottom.
Melvin?
"What is it, Melvin?"
Hmm?
- Nothing.
- Come on.
It's not like you've never seen this sort of thing before.
It's just that she's so young.
"Well, don't you remember?"
"What, two summers ago?"
The little boy who got hit by the speedboat.
Hmm?
Whew.
I'll never forget what he looked like.
Yeah.
"That was, uh-- [ Clears Throat ]"
That was horrible.
"You know, Melvin, I think this job's startin'to get to you."
It's just the formaldehyde.
It kind of--
[ Buzzer Buzzes ] Ah.
Must be Greg.
You are their son.
"What you are doing is wrong, wrong, wrong!"
Do you mind?
You're killing the romance in here.
"Well, it was a grueling two weeks, but you have your son back."
Ooh.
Mom.
Dad.
I missed you.
Aww!
[ Kissing ]
"- Homer, that's Hans Moleman."
- Can I keep him anyway?
Huh?
Huh?
"[ TV] "" ..."
"Scratchy Show """
[ Muffled Whimpering ]
"[ Gasps, Screaming ]"
[ Laughing Continues ] Funny.
That was delightful.
Did you see that?
That mouse butchered that cat like a hog.!
Is all TV this wonderful?
"Um, I'd kind of like to go home now."
Like a hog!
I-
- What?
What was that?
"Mr. Burns, I don't want to seem ungrateful... but I want to go home to my family."
[ Sighs ] I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you this... but I'm afraid your family doesn't want you back.
[ Stilted Speech ] I do not miss Bart at all.
"Quiet with those hands, If you are better than I,"
"Eh, is passing something here."
We are going to see.
"It quiets about that purse,"
"I have not made anything, Help,"
Sight as it beats.
Has done me one trap?
you do not understand it?
Help.
"You wanted to deceive to me, eh?"
displeased!
"They see here, pig."
For already with that purse.
"Wretches, you are not going to help me?"
And you also.
And you.
Displeased.
Antonio!
-Antonio?
Who is Antonio?
"-Damn it is, has called to the dandy."
-It quiets.
It quiets.
-Larguémonos.
They see here.
"-It starts, that comes the dandy."
"Damn bastard, children of puta."
Children of grandísima puta.
I am going to kill them.
-You have seen what they have done to me?
-What have they done to you?
You know them?
- Behind you!
- Run!
Powerful.
I summon the forces of heaven and earth to defeat the demon before me!
"- Sifu, have some tea."
- Wong Fei-hung!
You despicable cad!
Come here!
Trouble!
Come out now!
"Who's looking for him, please?"
- He's Master Ding.
- Marshal of seven provinces.
- The Brave One.
- It's nice to meet you.
I'm here to arrest Wong Fei-hung.
This doesn't concern you.
Step aside.
"Marshal, have you met Wong Fei-hung?"
Of course!
We've even fought!
You fought him?
Does Wong Fei-hung look like me?
"No, Wong Fei-hung is a young man."
"At most, 22 years old."
"If he were that young, he'd invite you for tea to celebrate."
Why did you call him a despicable cad?
Are you messing with me?
"Marshal, I'll be honest with you."
I'm Wong Fei-hung.
You're Wong Fei-hung's father?
"Wong Fei-hung, stay there."
"the West Sitting Hall, and the president's bedroom."
"Killick, he's trying to burn the place."
Second floor.
Send your men.
Tyler?
Turn off the goddamn sprinklers!
Who makes this shit?
"Oh, shit!"
What was that?
I've been waiting all day to kill you.
Stop hurting my White House!
German mantle clock.
Empire style.
"Killick, report!"
"Killick, what the hell is happening?"
Report!
Killick can't come to the phone.
Where's my daughter?
Dad!
She's here with me..
"in the Oval Office, so why don't you come down and get her?"
What are you gonna do?
What do you think?
Why do you make all this shit personal?
"Oh, you're talking to me about personal.."
when you wanna blow up half the world for your kid!
What are you gonna do?
What I should've done in the beginning.
I'm gonna kill this prick.
Hey!
What?
You lied to all of us.
"So if she's a fucking head case, why do you even want to get involved with this one?"
I think she just needs some guidance.
And I've already had some sponsors asking about her.
- Who?
- Slaughter Water.
- Did you pitch Ryan?
"- Yeah, they don't want him."
He has an image problem I have to figure out.
Fuck.
Too fucked up for Slaughter Water.
How'd that happen?
Yeah?
- Hey.
- Hi.
Mario Goldsmith can be here by 4:00.
- Perfect.
- You did not.
I'm just gonna apologize to him.
I'm gonna smooth things over.
"You know what, I don't even care."
Just keep rubbing my feet.
Enjoy your meal.
Welcome to Patty Palace.
Can I take your...
Order?

Terry:
I'll take a triple cheeseburger.

- Extra onions...
And chili.
And...
- A tantalising invitation.
"- David, please..."
"Drink up, darling."
"- You'll be packed and ready, won't you?"
- You needn't worry.
I'm ready now.
Good.
Daddy.
"Mother, I apologise for David."
He finds it difficult to be with people now.
- You understand?
"- Of course, darling."
- My poor girl.
- No.
I'm all right.
We're all all right.
"Aren't we, Tom?"
"Aye, indeed we are."
"Well, goodbye, Mistress."
These are for you and your husband.
There's little enough to eat in London at the moment.
"Thank you, Tom."
"Thank you, Tom."
"Come on, Tom."
He's drunk.
- Is he always like that?
"- Most of the time, but he's a good friend."
"Any time you want to come home, you and Jo..."
No.
"My home is here, Mother, with David and Jo."
It was you who told me not to expect marriage to be uninterrupted pleasure.
- I'm afraid it was.
- Shut up!
"- Dude, come on..."
- I said shut up!
Go!
get me out of here!
Help!
"Excuse me, can I see your ticket?"

"Hey, it's Fred!"
My life is a horror movie!
It's so scary!
I'm so scared!
"And you'll be, too, once you hear about it."
You'll be scared and scarred.
Scare-arr-red!
"That's a new word I just made up, scared and scarred combined."
Which is what you'll be.
I'm gonna go get a snack.

"Sallah, get down here!"
You pour.
"Oh, that's good."

"What is this stuff, Rene?"
I grew up with this.
It's my family label.
Well...
"I have to be going now, Rene."
"I like you, Rene, very much."
Perhaps we'll meet someday under better circumstances.
"We meet again, Fraulein."
"You Americans, you're all the same."
Always overdressing for the wrong occasions.
Now... what shall we talk about?
All right... take it up!
Easy!
You're as stubborn as that girl.
"You like her too much, I think."
Your methods of archaeology are too primitive for me.
You would use a bulldozer to find a...
China cup.

I asked you for a drink.
-You wanted a drink?
-l just asked you for a fuckin' drink.
"I thought you said that you were ""all right, Spider."""

"Adam was given a $20 tip, bringing his total for the evening to 60 bucks."
"Gentlemen, you guys have a good night."
"And even though I laid on the charm with the ladies, they only gave me $10, making my tip total for the night $30, which meant Adam beat me at my own game."
- Thanks for getting us home safe.

He needs to be cleared before we move him upstairs.
- I could go off.
- He could get hypotensive.
Are you scared?
I'd be scared.
No!
Give him two liters of saline...
- ... and monitor him for a few hours.

Great!
Got a gang shootout here.
Couple DOA's at the scene.
Another rig's coming behind me.

Thank you for letting me know.
Your real look!
So I thought...
I also should tell you.
It's my real look!
My father was the same.
Bald head!

Come to have dinner with us!
Xiamu?
Are you still there?
"Someone stands beside you, would it be me?"
"- Ricky, my husband."
Ricky.

"- No, it's just a nickname."
I gave it to him a longtime ago.
Any kids?
You're still young.
What are you looking for?
Our father.
And who is that?
What did you want from me?
Are you Algerian?
- Not any more.
- Jewish?
No.
Muslim?
Christian?
Why is it so important?
Because we need to know why they separated you from our mother.
I don't know what you're talking about.
"Dorona, what do you want from me?"
This is your mother and this is you.
"Very beautiful woman, your mother."
She's obviously very brave.
How did she die?
An operation.
"Are you angry with her, Dorona?"
Don't be angry with her.
Don't cry my love.
I'm going back soon.
I moved my flight up.
Why did you come?

"[Ringing continues, growling]"
Where are the coins?
[Groans]
Where are the coins?
Where are the coins?
Where are they?
[Landing blow]
Who are you?
I'm the one who asks the questions.
Where are the coins?
[Groans] I don't have them.
They were taken from me.
Give me his name.
Farley Kolt.
Kolt does not have them.
I found him in Los Angeles.
I wasted three days finding out he didn't have them.
I don't plan to waste that much time with you.
[Breathing heavily]
"Look, I told you, I don't have the coins."
Where are the coins?
[Hisses] [Knocking on door]
Captain?
Sergeant Wu.
Detective Griffin wanted me to come over and check on you.
[Knocking on door] Captain?
"If you can hear me, please open the door."
Captain?
"Listen, I'm not sure he's home."
I'm going to get the key from the super.
Stay here.
"What kind of person do you think I am, to bring me here?"
"It's immoral, unethical and a bad example to the common people."
What a lovely bottom!
"Brother Foon, what's brought you here?"
I've missed you.
- Really?
- Marshal?
Marshal?
Shall we go?
"Since we're here, I want to find out if they employ any underage girls."
"- Come on, drink up."
"- OK, I'll drink up."
- Drink.
- OK.
"Mousy, relax."
You've gone red.
It's because I drank too much wine.
You've been drinking soya sauce!
- Open your mouth!
- Have another cup!
I want to talk to this girl.
- What are you doing?
- Stop there!
- What do you want?
- I want to speak to your wife.
- Do you know who I am?
- Do you know who I am?
- Who are you?
- Leung Foon of Bo Chi Lam.

Yes.
I'm inside.
Be careful.
Marilyn could come home at any minute.
"Okay, Ricky."
Oh my.
"Marnie, what are you doing?"
I'm dusting for fingerprints.
And a little dirt.
"Come on, Marnie."
Looks for something that looks like a clue.
"Sorry, Ricky."
Let's start looking right now.
It's a very scary foyer.
I'm going to look around it.
"Here I go, Ricky."
I'm looking.
Please don't just run in circles.
"Marnie, what's that?"
It's a picture of their fat son.
"No, no, no."
Stand perfectly still.
Oh boy.
Look at the remotes.
The remotes?
"I'm looking at the remotes, Ricky."
Zoom in on the remotes.
"Zooming in, Ricky."
I've been studying the crime scene.
Usually there's 13 remotes.
Now there's only 12.
"Marnie,"
I think we just figured out what the murder weapon was.
You know... .
- You look older.
More grown-up.
- A uniform helps.
- And all the decorations.
- Yeah.
- What have you been doing?
- Living in New York.
I remember you liked to write.
- I did some writing.
- Get any published?
"No, I got a job working for a book publisher."
"He didn't publish those books with the plain wrappers, did he?"
- Remember?
- No.
"- Yes, you do."
Remember?
- Yes.
You were always afraid.
And everything frightened you.
I can't get over how wonderful you look.
Really.
You look great.
Thanks.
"You know, you never said goodbye to me when you left Peyton Place."
You never even said goodbye.
"I'll never forget that Labor Day, Norman."
I won't either.
- I see you have two Purple Hearts.
- Yeah.
What brings you home?
Vacation?
It is.
Mainly it is heartaches.
You mean real heartaches?
"Deep down, world looking empty?"
"-- ""Need a shoulder to lean on"" heartaches?"
-
"- Yes, they're the ones."
"Yes, that's them."
I get 'em sometimes.
I know what they're like.
-
- They're terrible.
-
- Terrible!
I used to get 'em a lot.
Used to think life was really bad.
Then me husband left me.
I've felt heaps better since!

"- Yes, he did."
"More importantly, he had no idea it was you."
"Yeah, but was all that really necessary?"
I am not whipped.
"It's all part of the play, Richard."
- Not my play.

-lt's all right.
Hear from anyone in the department today?
A couple of the guys.
What did they say?
I called to pick up his things from the precinct.
They said his locker was sealed.
But the captain came to see me.
He was very nice.
What captain?
Homicide South.
Eddie's commander.
He's required to call on the widow.
is anything wrong?
Don't talk to anyone without checking with me first.
Okay?
We're in the wrong business.
You get lost?
"There's a key to downtown Brooklyn, but I sure don't have it."
"Murray, Lenny, you know Kevin."
"Kevin, this is Dan."
"Kevin, how are you?"
"Tex, sit down."
Take a load off.
"Louisiana, Murray, for the umpteenth time."
Can't take a joke?
"I have seen it, Shiv."
What happened?
I am remembering a few things.
Just a second.
It's a classic 70mm 3D Jodha Akbar scenario!
Oh God!
I look so hot in that costume.
And Zak was getting beaten up back then as well.
Take a look.
He looked like a joker back then too.
And you were so sexy back then too!
Press it again.
Press it again.
Go to hell if you don't want to believe it.
Baby... slave...
Massage my feet before you leave.
- Get lost!
- Farewell my subjects!
Wow!
Helicopter!
Who am I?
Osama?
Shiv...
- Yes.
- Don't move.
- What happened?
There's a spider on you.
What are you doing!
Where did it go?
- I feel ashamed.
- Why?
"Back in that life, you had killed a tiger."
I made friends with a transvestite prostitute.
Another one?
Big deal.
Uh...
I slept with Olivia!
You what?
!
That's good.
Yeah.
More stuff like that.
Tell her where.
"Uh, okay."
In your living room.
"Kitchen floor, on your bed... where your head goes."
Olivia!
"Oh, I'm not ashamed of anything I did to him."
"I am, a little."
Can you at least wear the gloves?
You're getting palm sweat all over the steering wheel.
Don't worry.
I'm getting everything.
"Over the shoulder, over the shoulder!"
"Abby, over my shoulder!"
"Okay, all right."
"If it makes you feel any better, way more people than this have gathered around to see my vagina."
That does not make me feel better.
Nor I.
Billie!
Billie!
Zack!
Did I miss anything?
I love you.
Perhaps he's doing his nets or something.
Did you telephone Dr. Mead?
"Yes, of course."
[Ursula]:
Do you think he's dead?
I suppose the sensible thing would be to turn him over.
"Oh, God."
"Oh, Janet, you do it."
He's alive.
The tide's low enough for you to get round the point.
See if you can find Pendered... and Luke.
Get them to bring a stretcher.
And ask Mrs. Pendered for some brandy.
Go on!
He's barely alive!
And send Joe Gallow on his bike to find Dr. Mead.
[Man]:
"What you got there, missus?"
"I should have thought that was obvious, Mr. Pendered."
[Pendered]:
I don't know where he's come from.
Ain't no sign of a wreck.
"- You hear anything, Lukey?"
- No.
That's enough for now.
[Pendered]:
Get him on the stretcher.
Be careful with that ankle.
I think it's broken.
"Lift on three, Lukey."
Three!
[Janet]:
Maybe a robbery.
There's nothing in the room except for a coat...
Got it.
Hanging behind the bathroom door.
[Police radio chatter]
There's a key here.
Looks like a rental.
[Car beeps]
There we go.
"Hey, we got some equipment back here."
"Cameras, lenses, monopod."
Let's see what he was taking pictures of.
[Phone rings]
[Computer beeps]
Download's done.
Let's see what this guy was shooting.
I hope it's not something too gross.
- What the hell?
- Why's this guy watching us?
I don't know.
Better find out.
"All right, we better tell the captain."
I'll call him.
Might be a good idea to put some uniforms at our houses.
Got it.
I'll send one to the captain's.

You cannot...

"I know, but..."
It would have been so Of Mice and Men.
I didn't do it.
But back to the Denzel story somebody thought Michael was Denzel.
Did you ever think that maybe Denzel was just standing behind you?
- We looked to make sure.

"I looked around for Denzel, because I love Denzel."
- But there is no Denzel.
"- No, it was me."
Did we have any celebrity sightings on the shoot?
- I don't...

Incense is great!
Okay!
Okay!

Of course I am!
"By the way, Hibara-san."
Hm?
"Actually, I have a favor to ask you."
Smoke?
I heard about your grandfather.
I heard that he deals with things from the other side.
Fumi-chan!
Sorry!
Saho-san was looking up things like that!
There are... a lot of things that I want to know.
Is it possible for me to talk to him?

You already missed the funeral.
You think I feel good about not being there?
Truthfully?
"I don't know, I can't tell."
"I mean, we were invisible to that man."
"I would have taken anything from him, even disappointment."
Because at least it would have been something.
"Listen, Mary."
"You know this is really hard for you to accept, okay?"

That's very considerate of you.
"Can I see you in my office, please?"
Should I come in and take notes?
- No.

"Well, if I tell you that it wouldn't be a safe house, would it?"
And you wouldn't be in protective custody.
"And besides, it's only for an hour."
(GROANS)
"You do know what they'll do when they find me, don't you?"
(PHONE RINGS)
(BEEP)
WOMAN:
"Pick up, come on, come on."
"Bitch, pick up!"
"All right, now listen."
Have you done as you were asked?
Have you?
(HANGS UP)
RIPLEY:
No sign of Cameron.
Flat's completely empty.
LUTHER:
Why the empty flat?
LUTHER:
It's almost like he's never been here before.
(PHONE RINGS)
"Hello, your call cannot be taken at the moment, so please leave your message after the tone."
(BEEP)
MAN:
I know you're there.
"Benny, it's Ripley, mate."
"I need you to trace a call going to this number, yeah?"
"Hello, Cameron."
"Blimey, the newsagent's is closer now we're in a smaller studio."
Shut up.
You're spoiling the magic for everyone.
Oh.
"Oh, look, the newsagent."
"Hello, me old darling."
"Yep, it's me, Richie Rich."
Don't faint.
Treasure the moment.
Here's a pic.
Put it in your box of precious things.
I don't understand what you're talking about.
"Oh, yes."
"Oh, yes, I'm sure."
"One of the cool type, are we?"
Gonna boast to your friends?
"""I met Richie Rich and pretended not to recognise him."
"Hee hee. """
What a sad little life you must lead.
Are you mad?
"- Perhaps a little zany, yes."
- Excuse me.
Do you have part one of Poncy Cooking with part two free?
- Certainly.
"One pound, please."
- Aha.
"I'm afraid I have no money so I'll just take part two for nothing, shall I?"
- You stupid slag!
"Come on, Richie."
"- One pound, please."
"Er, hurr..."
I'll give you a mensh on me next programme.
You're not the one who disappeared.
You would've had to have been there in the first place.
"No, not Artie."
"Oh, all your--all your secrets,"
"And your--and your treasure hunts,"
And that damned place.
"You know, James believed in life."
You need to get one.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Carol.
Carol.
Carol.
Could you please--please.
Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
- What?
- Listen.
Listen.
Listen.
"Carol, if you're harboring him in any way,"
You're in danger.
What are you doing here?
Just about to ask you the same thing.
Why are you bothering that poor woman and torturing yourself?
It is called investigating a case.
This isn't the case.
This is self-pity.
The case is the implosion grenade
And the sword.
And someone out there is running around
What's up with step one?
You've skipped step one and two.
What's step three again?
You ask me what's wrong!
Got it.
Good.
You bet.
Go ahead.
Where?
- Step three.
- What's step three again?
(EXHALES)
We'll skip step three.
I'm just going to tell you what's wrong.
That should have been step one.
Wrong.
Step one and two are fundamental steps.
"You missed steps, Stewart."
How?
"Step one, become angry with someone."
"Step two, tell that someone that you're angry."
"Step three, resolve anger with that someone."
- Step four...
- (SCOFFING) Step four.
"Step four, resume peaceful existence."
Your logic is frighteningly bewitching.
Phantasmagoric.
It's time for you to go.
What?
Where?
Leave here?
It was a rebound.
Here`s to a very restful vacation.
Here`s to a very relaxing vacation a renewed love affair and a time of joy with our kids.
"You know, I`ve never told you this."
I know it`s been a rough beginning.
I think there`s something wrong here!
It`s the bed.
It will slow down in a second.
I got it!
hold on to this.
Enjoy it.
What are you doing?
"Let`s try this, my darling."
We haven`t done this in a Iong time.
Oh!
clark!
What`s that noise?
What`s going on?
Don`t you kids knock anymore?
"Sorry, we thought you were fighting."
Nobody is fighting in here.
It`s very late.
Where is Mom?
"I`m under here, kids."
Go back to bed.
"Go back to bed, now."
The bed was very soft.
"""Weird-o-rama! """
This is the same street Wyatt Earp kept law and order on.
It seems kind of dirty and touristy.
The Old West was dirty.
Everything isn`t like home.
"If it were, there`d be no reason for leaving home."
"(sniffs) Oh, God."
It smells like Miss Dictorian's perfume.
I can't wear this.
I'm a fraud.
No absents?
"Oh, I've got one big absent... my soul."
"Manny, you've spent your whole life trying to be perfect, and this is throwing you for a loop..."
I get it.
"But if you just look around this room, you'll realize people make mistakes."
"You could do way worse than you did last night, and it ain't gonna change a thing."
So my advice... try to be a little easier on yourself.
(man wolf-whistling)
"Thanks, Jay."
"Oh, God, there's Chyna."
Pretending to ignore me!
She's as transparent as her pumps.
- (applause)
- James Earl Carter.
Have you seen my booboo?
Ohh!
Poor baby!
Mwah.
Vice principal:
Nicole Ingrid Cortez.
(applause)
Can you please move over?
I have to kill someone.
Vice principal:
Charles Mark Coleson.
I hope that you had fun last night.
"Oh, I did."
It was a magical time.
"Yeah, space, totally."
I know.
"- Hey, do you know where Ryan is?"
"- 'Cause we had fun last night, and I thought just maybe..."
- Ryan's actually at school doing
- School?
- I don't know.
He's kind of a dork now.
Thanks.
"- She's agreed to supervised visitation, 20 minutes max."
"- She's my daughter, Sandy."
I don't need to be supervised.
I'm supervising her.
I'm afraid she might kill you.
- I'm sorry.
About yesterday.
- So that's it?
No second thoughts?
You're not going to change your mind?
"- It's what I have to do, Kiki, for Julie... to save our marriage."
- Who is going to save the company?
- You.
That's why I'm appointing you Newport Group's Chief Financial Officer.
'Cause we all know whoever controls the money controls t
- Really.
Does Julie know that?
- She'll find out.
- I don't know.
"- Come on, Kiki."
The company needs you.
The family needs you.
I need you.
What is Cock or Balls?
"It's like Rock paper scissors, except you stand back-to-back, unzip your fly, pull out a little bit of skin, and the other guy has to guess whether he's looking at your cock or your balls."
Best two-out-of-three wins.
Somebody wins?
[Eddie] [groans] I'll go first.
[clears throat]
"If I win, you gotta face Cassie."
"Okay, and if I win, you shut the fuck up about that book."
Deal.
"Wait, y'all actually about to play this shit?"
No peeking.
No need.
I can draw a courtroom sketch of his dick.
"All right, ready?"
"Yeah, did you find it?"
"Three, two, one."
- Balls.
- Fuck!
Every time.
[Ron's zipper opens]
- You all right back there?
- Yep.
Whew!
Okay.
♪ funky rock music ♪
What do you think of that?
"Yeah, drink it in."
Why are you so fucking close?
Balls.
- Cock.
- [Adam] Wow.
Bullshit!
I could use good some employees.
They don't challenge you at all in this hotel.
How much?
"Three Euros an hour, plus tips."
"Three Euros, fixed?"
Fixed.
Welcome!
"Nora, you've made the right decision."
I hope that in the next few years...
"Viktor, that's enough."
... we'll lay the groundwork for a great program.
Here's to a fruitful cooperation.
- Harmann.
That's you.
"Yes, but please don't interrupt!"
There's more.
Can I choose now?
Pop culture.
It crashed.
"So tell me, I heard you were politically active?"
Do you still want to see the rest?
Yes.
That'll be a bit difficult  without hands.
I'm listening.
Jesus and the Merchants
Jesus and the Merchants
Classic!
Now this place has atmosphere!
"Yes, great!"
Classic!
Look at the atmosphere!
It's a dead end!
- Need to talk to you.
- Okay.
Why don't you take a few minutes and come to my office.
"Yeah, sure."
Mr. Milliken?
Mr. Milliken?
"Oh, my god."
Mrs. Milliken!
Come quickly!
Quickly!
Hey.
How's the hand?
It's fine.
How'd Chappelle find out?
"I don't know, it doesn't really matter."
What's going on out there?
"Almeida's going to be interrogating Nina, and I'll follow it from a feed."
"Okay, good."
Make sure Tony puts double security on the doors.
Get back to me as soon as she gives you anything.
"Agent Bauer, keep pressure here."
Sure.
Thank you.
"Jack, you're about to find something out about me that's not going to make you happy."
What are you talking about?
Excuse me.
Do you mind?
I've got a daughter.
- A daughter?
- It was sprung on me a month ago.
"Her mother dropped her off, and she split."
It's a long story.
-No worries.
You never know.
See you.
What are you doing here?
Who are you?
Looking for an apartment...
There is no housing.
I have no money.
You've got the documents?
No.
"Come on, get out!"
Line!
You do not have to look for here.
How long was it?
-10 Minutes.
-Just.
"In barely 10 minutes later I noticed the ad, intercepted, searched and forced him out of the neighborhood."
"I'm not ga over there look, it's over."
We can go.
-OK.
Here we go.
"Listen, it's not complicated."
"I want 4 grenades, 3 electrical detonators and 5 kg of explosives."
Explosives?
What kind?
-C4.
Got it or not?
I've got everything.
But it will give you 5 pounds?
You want to breathe the air of Paris?
You are right.
Better that nothing not talking.
Eveyone used to call her her as Meena with love
Did you call her that too?
- No.
In college I was a shyster.
I was scared to talk to girls.
But this girl was vey...
"An_ay, forget it."
What use digging up the past?
Exactly.
No use.
Was she beautiful?
"Yes, she was nice."
Roundish face.
Large eyes.
Long tresses.
"Now that you mention her, I think she was quite exotic."
And so you fell for her?
"- Who, me?"
Forget it.
At the beginning I never used to look at her.
"But one day something strange happened, and..."
Forget it.
Why dig up the past?
- Right.
No use.
So you were saying...
what happened that day?
"What day... yes, that day ...it so happened..."
"ARer college, I find only Meenakshi standing at the bus-stop."
I didn't mind her.
Like me she must've come to catch a bus.
There was a silence.
Pancakes.
Pancakes.
Don't be afraid.
It's just me.
"Summer, you're such a good mother."
Thanks.
"When I think of the lengths that you're going to to save your adopted rabbit son, and my own mother can't even pick up the phone and send me a text message saying, ""Hi."
"Are you alive ?"""
That's okay... you have us now.
"Seth and I rode on a bicycle just so we could be here together, and Julie and Kaitlin left a message and the Cohens asked about you."
"Yeah, I know... you're right."
"You know, if there's one thing"
"I've learned over the years, it's you make your own family."
It seems to me that you've scraped together quite an awesome one.
Wait.
What ?
You hear that ?
Where ?
In the vent.
It's Pancakes.
Pancakes ?
Pancakes ?
Here.
Pancakes ?
Pancakes ?
"Um, stay there, Pancakes."
Let's pry this open.
Okay.
Pancakes ?
There he is !
Come on !
Good boy !
How's she doing?
We couldn't revive her.
She's...
"I know she looked bad, but you guys usually..."
Stephanie's injuries were overwhelming.
We did everything we could.
"He'll be OK, it's, um, just rough."
I'm sorry.
"- OK, Doc, time's up."
- Stay away from me.
"- Come on, get up."
- I'm not finished treating.
... She died!
An officer's dead and we need to interview.
"Just back up, right now."
Throw some bandages on him.
This piece of crap needs to get charged!
Come on!
"Come on, get up!"
"Come on, get up!"
"OK, OK!"
We gotta get him to division before his lawyer gets here.
"- OK, calm down."
- I am calm!
"Call the divisional detective, tell her what happened"
"- so she can call homicide, OK?"
- What about Pike?
Dr. Connor isn't going to let him walk out of here.
"- Are you, Dr. Connor?"
"- No, I'm not."
Stephanie was 34 years old.
What a waste.
Horton died.
"Sorry, colonel."
"-Things fall that way sometimes, Bill."
-Yeah.
Sure he ain't here;
You can look.
I....
"l shouldn't have asked that, colonel."
Good night.
Night.
"Why is Brock frightened, Sarah Beth;"
Doesn't he know Mac can get him off;
"Yes, Papa, he knows that, but he knows he can't get you off."
"The man Brock shot, he called Brock names."
"Not pretty names, either."
They'd sound awful at a trial.
Especially when they're true.
Brock thought-- He wanted to spare you something.
He can't spare me anything.
It seems none of us can spare the others anything.
"You go to bed, Sarah Beth."
I've got to find him.
I've got to get to him before he does something.
I've got to get to him before some sheriff gets him.
"He's a good boy, Sarah Beth."
"Yes, I'm glad we know how good."
"You find him, Papa."
I'll find him.
"Get your Afternoon Star right over-- Here's your change, lady."
Late Afternoon Star.
"Thank you, sir."
Over here.
You have to visit.
Your house is large.
That would be ackward.
Maybe ill get a new exam in the university.
"Thats a good idea, good birdwatchers are needed in this country."
Thats for sure.
Its gonna be strange without the war
Yes.
-When do you leave?
-Tomorrow.
-How long is it since you have seen them?
Soon four years.
A beer?
"-No, i have to...."
"-You, all the others went into town."
"One beer in the cantine, just the two of us."
Is it a date?
If it helps we can call it that.
-It helps.
-Good.
Cheers!
Thanks
You didnt think you'd get away that easy?
Skinnarland sends his regards.
The sheriff is threatening with exposing them all.
-So you will have your hands full.
Straight back.
One-Two-Three...
"Good,Thanks."
-Einar reports about good weather in the area.
-Good.
-Have a good trip.
...96 64 09.
"No, 9."
Fuck.
627...
- Hello?
"- Marco, is that you?"
"- Yes, Benigno."
- It's great to hear you.
I've requested your visit.
I'll see you Saturday.
All right.
- Where are you?
- Outside the clinic.
Dr.Vega told me everything.
"How could you, Benigno?"
You haven't come back to freak out on me?
No.
Do you need anything?
I need information.
How's Alicia?
The staff is forbidden to talk to me.
"She's in another clinic, they don't know where."
I don't believe that.
"Neither do I, but I'm not surprised they won't tell us."
"Hey, man, are you still my friend?"
"Of course, whom do you think I'm here for?"
Then find out what's happened to Alicia.
"If she's alive, if she had a baby, if it's alive..."
I need to know.
"You understand, don't you?"
Yes.
I'll try to find out.
This is leading by example?
"It's not for us, stupido."
It's for the clients.
They're allowed to have pudding on their spa day.
It's like a -- a last hurrah before the real work starts.
[ Sighs ]
Get to work.
"Hey, Frank."
Frank:
Yeah?
We need to order more asparagus.
Okay.
[ Sighs ]
Mm.
What do you know?
"Looks like it's my ""spa day,"" too."
[ Chuckles lightly ]
[ Tranquil music plays ]
Sam:
"Okay, good job, guys."
"Go to, uh..."
Downward dog.
[ Grunts ] Hold for five minutes.
[ Exhales sharply ] Five minutes?
It's usually 30 seconds.
Right.
"Yeah, 30 seconds."
That's what -- that's what I mean.
"Okay, uh, I'll just come around, make sure everybody's form is okay, make sure you're, uh, keeping your cores tight, and, uh, your --"
"uh, good job."
Great.
Straighten that back out.
- We talked for an hour.
- Oh.
Oh.
Ah!
You've no memory of this.
- He was really drunk.
- Oh God.
I'm such an idiot.
I'm an idiot.
- Meredith was right about you
- No.
"- About me, about the whole thing."
- No.
Meredith was not right.
"It doesn't matter that I don't remember the specifics of what I said, because I was drunk when I said them and, you know..."
- In Vino Veritas.
- In Vino Veritas
"I mean, we know Vino Veritas is Latin for a reason."
It's just that you said some really beautiful things.
- You did.
- That's when I cried.
"I meant those things that I said, every word."
"Yeah, ok."
"Alright, we should get going."
You need to get your stuff.
It's like an hour to Sudbury or something.
You're gonna drive us?
- You asked me to.
- You asked her to.
Right.
Right.
"Hey, can we stop at a mall or something?"
It's when I'm nervous.
I used to sing that song to my children.
When they are scared.
To help them sleep.
"And now, whenever I am frightened..."
"Beautiful story, now shut the fuck up."
Shit.
"Hey, hey, no, no."
They are Massalit.
Villagers.
Farmers.
Why are they running?
- That's why.
- Janjaweed.
JACOUB:
What do we do?
Depends how many there are.
Let's take one alive and find out.
- You take the wheel.
- What?
Drive right up beside him.
You son of a bitch.
Jacoub!
Get off there and translate for me.
He's going to tell us where the camp is.
(SPEAKING IN SUDANESE ARABIC)
"If you become Tahir's woman, it will make you safe."
And you also.
I promise.
You cannot save everyone.
That's what Bakri said.
"But saving even one person, surely, would be something."
But that leaves us one short to Mick Jagger's.
Van Hoogstratten.
See me in my office.
What is it?
You ok?
I'm in!
Congratulations!
"Now, let's go out the homosex."
You know...
"The tall guy, Ralph?"
What?
He's gay!
Standing in the fog always gives me strange feelings.
Yeah.
This is something that only really happens in winter.
"But, I wonder if Saho can knows this place."
Ah.
Maybe the fog isn't a good thing if you are waiting to meet someone.
Nice to meet you all.
My name is Katsuragi Saho.
She's really pretty.
I met Saho-san at her high school's culture festival.
Fumi-chan came to see us about how my club uses tarot cards.
Yeah!
She is like my teacher!
Saho-san knows so much!
I even learned how to use tarot cards!
Look!
I have my cards!
Does anyone want me to tell the future?
!
"Finally, a letter from Naples!"
"Vito, how do you like my little angel?"
Isn't she beautiful?
She's very beautiful.
"To you, she's beautiful."
"For me, there's only my wife and son."
Our dear mother - ...is dead!
We'll go backstage later and take her to eat.
"Sit down, you bum!"
"Oh, excuse me, Don Fanucci."
We'll go see her backstage.
Who was that?
The Black Hand.
That's Fanucci...the Black Hand.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
Tomorrow!
Always tomorrow!
You'll pay me today!
Let's go.
Not my daughter!
Let her go!
"Here, take all my money!"
"Vito, come on."
I know what you're thinking.
But you don't know how things are.
Fanucci's with the Black Hand.
The whole neighborhood pays him.
"Even my father, in the grocery store."
If he's Italian why does he bother other Italians?
He knows they have nobody to protect them.
Forget that.
Did you like my angel?
- For a job.
- You don't have a job?
- Did you see the pretty fish over there?
- Did you lose your job?
My daddy lost his job.
- Did you get a new job?
"- Yes, giving big shots to little girls."
- Mommy!
- Big shots.
There you go.
- Mrs. Riblet.
Weak and dizzy all over.
- Be still my heart.
- Smell something?
- Yeah.
"Ma'am, smoking is not permitted in the hospital."
This is my glaucoma medicine.
My grandson grows it.
"Oh, no, thanks."
Put that there.
"Why don't we put these away, so that we don't get busted?"
- Smells like primo stuff.
- Yeah?
"God, I miss the '60s."
- New computer?
- Yeah.
CD-ROM.
I'm connecting us up by modem to Mount Sinai.
Pooling our resources.
A couple more things.
Dr. Benton goes nuts if you're late or don't answer a page on the first beep.
He has a bad temper.
"And tell Mrs. Manicotti that I'll stop up there later, okay?"
All right.
Should I take the rest of the dog food along?
No.
I won't have to feed him till tomorrow morning
-when I get him back.
"-Oh, I see."
Okay.
"- Don't drop him now, Trix."
"-No, I won't."
"- Oh, he's a good fella."
Bye.
-Thank you.
"- I'll see you later, Alice."
"-All right, bye-bye."
(clears throat)
"Hiya, sweetheart."
"Hiya, Ralph."
I'll have your supper ready for you in a minute.
"Oh, don't go to any trouble."
I'm not gonna eat here.
I'll eat over at the lodge.
I got just enough time to wash up and get over there.
We got another emergency meeting.
Again?
!
"Ralph, you had an emergency meeting last night."
-So?
-So?
Do you realize you Racoons have more emergency meetings than the U.N.?
Just so happens that the Racoons have more emergencies than the U.N.
(Alice sighs)
It's empty.
Just one bullet.
Hey!
Stop.
Ram.
Gopal.
What's his name?
Verma.
Stop.
Stop.
What are you?
What if he had fired?
If he had fired Bittoo would be dead... and Verma's son would've been hanged.
The same thing... will imply on Boss and Shiv.
I didn't get it.
Boss will kill Shiv... and he'll be foreshadowing crime.
But the Boss workforces.
I don't trust my father.
It's an old rule.
First clear the garbage then clearly record.
Hi Ankita.
Hi.
Why did you come out?
From today your outgoing...
Yeah hello.
And your phone's incoming is barred.
Go lock yourself in the room.
There are 200 channels on Tata Sky.
Sit at home and watch television.
I'll call you when it's time for the engagement... and nuptial ceremonies.
Don't come out until I don't call you.
Go.
Wow.
I get it.
"You are a trip, Ms. Sciuto."
"That's a good thing, right?"
(sighs)
What now?
Where is Baylor and who shot Ridgeway?
Wickes might be able to tell us if we ask nicely.
I'll ask.
I've seen your nice.
I'm going with you.
You said man-to-man.
Oh.
"Right, I'm sorry, we haven't met."
"Hi, I'm Elizabeth Brighton,"
SECNAV's public affairs officer during this time of crisis.
Wickes and I are going to form a special bond of our own.
(snickers)
GIBBS:
We think she might have a connection to whoever shot the secretary.
You know her?
(sighs)
I don't recognize her.
Did you talk to Lawrence Ridgeway?
He's dead.
He was murdered?
Murder weapon was a hunting rifle.
It's rare.
You know anyone with something like that?
(phone rings)
WICKES:
No.
The Boss is being over-enthusiastic... but I'm going to use my brains.
By playing the right card at the right moment.
Daddy.
By the time he plays his cards...
Shiv and Ankita will already have their honeymoon.
I'm moron.
Hold on.
Jabbar bhai.
Dad call Jabbar bhai right now.
On the spot finish his entire family right now.
- Father's here.
- So what?
- Father's here.
- Shiv?
I told you we'll be visiting the saint's tomb one day.
And return to Benaras after that.
We'll visit the shrine today.
It's a good day today.
I'm pleased that you've been released.
And even happier... that you didn't need that goon's help for it.
Brother...
Brother come in.
No actually I couldn't do the job.
So I'm here to return Mr. Satyakant's money.
Brother come... come in.
- I'll leave.
- Please.
Please.
Brother come...
I'm going to the shrine.
Are you coming?
Yes father.
Theta bands could indicate at least half a dozen different things.
One of which is pain.
"The fact that he's no longer screaming makes us feel better, not necessarily him."
Chase!
How's cameron?
She's not giddy.
Fever's down.
White count's improving.
Has she said anything to you?
"You mean like,""I completely understand why foreman did what he did, and I hold no grudge?"""
What I did... did save my life.
Get in here and help!
Forget the suit!
He's tachycardic!
Wide-complex looks like v-tach!
It's not cryptococcus!
What?
- House was wrong.
The samples were negative.
So what is it?
We don't know!
- Give him in the amio.
Do we have any more leads?
That was our lead!
Foreman!
So the treatment isn't doing anything.
Foreman!
He's in v-fib!
No good.
Hit him again.
"Come on, man."
"Come on, joe."
"- Hey, John, check the words to this."
Yo!
"And I ain't chatting no black talk, mate."
Yo means I in Spanish.
- Very impressive.
- There's more.
Yo no soy marinero.
I ain't no sailor.
Soy capitan.
I'm captain.
I've found Risdale.
"To dance La Bamba, what do you need?"
Una poca de gracia
Shut up!
"For once in your stupid and pointless life, shut up."
"I'm in love, mate."
Do you know what it feels like to be in love?
Have you ever been in love?
"Seriously, John, that ain't a trick question."
Have you ever loved anybody?
Anybody whose name isn't Mercer?
We're going to the seaside.
Pack a bag.
"Mi amor, Calum."
Mi gusto los churros a los chico.
You forget about the sea sometimes.
Yeah.
It reminds me of biscuits.
Really?
Why's that?
"When we were just little kids, my dad used to take us to the seaside."
Me and my sister would sit in the back eating digestive biscuits.
Dennis!
"- That's not Dennis, Mumsie."
- Of course it's Dennis.
- I should know.
"- Well, it can't be."
Then who was the man in the trunk?
"Oh, Mumsie, what have you done?"
What have I done?
!
You have murdered an innocent bystander.
Control yourself.
- Get this back to the barge.
- Why?
"If he misses it, he'll be suspicious."
"Besides, it pointless our taking it while he's alive."
"If I nobble him now, we can get it back."
Though why you had to go and warn him...
Hurry!
Hurry!
Our whole future depends on it.
(Chuckles)
Forgive me.
I was getting rid of my daughter.
Getting rid of people seems to be a hobby of yours.
Eh?
!
Are you sure you won't have a drink?
"Oh, no."
"For once, I think I won't."
- Oh...
- Please sit down.
Business before pleasure.
- Look.
Good Sir Knight.
Good Sir Knight.
We're so grateful to you for rescuing us from those foul fiends.
Upsy-daisy.
"Very gracious of you, Sir Knight."
"We're very undeserving, really."
We're just humble fisher folk.
"However, we do have this maiden daughter."
As there is this custom the knight quite often marries the maiden he's rescued.
"Say hello to the knight, Griselda honey."
It was me that rescued you.
Will you clear off?
"What do you say, Sir Knight?"
Good Sir Knight.
- Well?
- Hark.
Be gone.
- Wait!
- Come back here!
"Sir Knight, come back, please!"
Griselda.
Mr. Fishfinger.
I've got to go.
Sorry about your hand.
It hurts!
I've missed you.
I've kept your potato.
Bye!
You really are a big disappointment to me.
I thought you were gonna make something of yourself.
He is the king's champion!
You're my partners.
You're holding so many options on land you could buy Brooklyn.
You could probably buy Staten Island too.
"Would you excuse us, please?"
Of course.
I got an appointment anyway.
Good.
Then it works out nicely.
You sure BankExchange is all set?
We got everything we wanted.
Now you can get something else for me.
- What's that?
- My name out of the papers.
How?
"With $40,000."
"What am I going to do with $40,000?"
Let me ask you a question.
"You ever heard of a cop with $40,000?"
Who wasn't crooked?
"A cop with $40,000 would make big headlines."
Say hello to Nettie for me.
I will.
- Take care.
- All right.
That's for the dead cop.
Reverend Chapman will introduce me?
With one sentence.
And then what?
Get out of here.
- And which way is that?
- Side door.
No.
Look around you...
"new fallen snow, you're with your family."
I just know this is going to be a great day.
Sue?
Sue Murphy?
"Oh, fuck me!"
"Hi, Ginny!"
"Oh, hi, Frank."
"How's the job hunt going, you poor thing?"
Any nibbles?
I should've died in Korea.
"Go play with Maureen, that's fun!"
Sorry about Frank.
He hasn't been himself lately.
That's all right.
Failure can break down even the strongest man.
How are you?
"Must have been a difficult Christmas after, you know,"
Greg abandoned you and the kids.
"Oh, no, we're back together!"
Greg took a Catholic cruise with Father Pat and came back a different man.
We're going at it like newlyweds!
"Well, that's a dirty mouth."
"Mister, I'm gonna shut you up."
"- Oh, yeah."
"- Oh, hi, stud!"
"Dear Lord, give me strength."
"Vagina, vagina, vagina!"
"Hey, baby!"
Looking attractive!
"Christ, I hate it here."
Bunch of kids.
Good luck with that.
Yeah I know.
Well it's not that big a deal.
It's not like Hannah Montana hasn't complicated your life before.
Yeah.
And I dealt with it then and I'll deal with it now.
-Hey there you are.
-Jesse!
"Whoa, whoa, dude!"
You're that guy dating Hannah Montana.
Did you know that?
Yeah I saw it on Leno.
[Laughs] Me too!
Up top bro!
Yeah.
Jesse what are you doing here?
Casual acquaintance and platonic friend.
-Nice.
-Your dad told me you were at the pier.
I just had some great news I had to tell you.
I can't wait aforementioned casual acquaintance and platonic friend.
Overkill.
My dad's coming home from overseas.
My gosh Jesse that's great.
Miley.
Dang it.
Hey it's okay.
I don't think anybody noticed.
One at a time bro.
"Oh, Hannah Montana's new boyfriend, Jesse,"
Apparently caught cheating today.
Ooh!
That's your friend from school.
Uh-huh.
"So, you're wearing a Mayhem shirt."
I am.
Yeah.
"Isn't the singer, like, a cannibal?"
"'Cause you're in, like, a Christian power metal band."
Seems kind of weird.
I don't know.
"No, actually that was just a rumor."
But he didn't actually eat anyone.
And Crucifictorious is actually...
It's not power metal.
"We're more of extreme grindcore with like, heavy thrash influences."
Like what thrash bands do you like?
Like Napalm Death?
Like the Keep?
Like Cannibal Corpse?
"Carcass, I mean, I really only have two sections for vinyl."
"Like metal, non-metal."
So...
Right.
"Well, mainly..."
You all ready to order?
Yeah.
I want the sizzling apple pie.
And I think also chips and...
"Oh, my..."
That's pathetic.
I'm back at the start.
What's up?
Um...
"Whose bag is that next to Mom's, and whose hat is that?"
It's a man's hat.
- Maybe Morn bought it for Dad.
"- Yeah, right."
"Anyway, this is what we have so far."
1.
The picture. 2.
Dates of Mom's trips.
3.
Algeria - black hole.
"And, oi course, Aunt Rosa."
She's obviously hiding something.
The conclusion is:
We have a father and we need to find him.
And the conclusion is:
"There are pills, Shai, and you need to take them."
"""Have a father must find him!"""
"Maybe you're right, maybe I'm nuts, but I can't sleep at night and you can't either."
Don't pretend.
"What are you getting at, Shai?"
"Tickets to Paris, voucher for a hotel on the Champs Elysees, inflatable pillow for the flight."
Maps.
Even new swimsuits.
The hotel has a pool.
You are nuts.
He's nuts.
We fly a week before Passover.
- I can't.
"- You're on vacation from school and Dorona, you're free now anyway."
- But...
- I spoke to Raziya.
You told Haziya?
For coming.
"Honey, we discussed this."
Just come tomorrow and help with lunch.
I keep my nose out of Dorona's business.
I'm afraid she'll hit me.
It's time to go.
"Come on, honey."
I'll drive you home and come back.
I don't want to leave them alone-They'll fall apart on me-.
"It's ok, I'll close the door."
- Were you smoking?
- No.
Liar.
Give me one.
- Where's the pack from?
- They're Mom's.
"Once a week, Saturday morning, with a shot of arak."
- Mom smoked on Sabbath?
- Where did you come from?
She promised not to smoke on Saturdays.
- It's cold.
- Did you take them home?
Kobi has an ear infection.
They don't need to be here.
- Where's your pervert friend?
"- Stop it, Natanel."
On the way to Frankfurt.
- Really?
Is he a flight attendant?
"- No, he's a lawyer."
Why?
I thought you were all flight attendants.
"Yes, sir, that is correct, sir."
- We are on full lockdown.
- Hey!
We need help up here now!
Security sweep!
Open up!
Thirty seconds.
Secure Air Comm.
Meet at the rally.
Armoury secure.
"All right, let's go."
"Let's move, move!"
- Hold up.
We're on full lockdown here.
- Hey!
East Hall secure.
Heading for Castle Sky.
You've reached the voice mail of Emily Cale.
Why aren't you texting me?
"Em, as soon as you get this, call me back."
"- Keep moving, keep moving!"
"- Martin, I'm right outside the Capitol."
What the hell is happening?
Do you have the president?
I have Eagle.
"Call WFO, get as many men as you can to the Capitol."
I'll dispatch everyone I can spare.
I want a hard perimeter around Castle.
A hard perimeter around Castle.
Eastside Gate.
"Come on, let's go, people."
"Fred, open the gate."
Gossip girl might be right about me
But she's--she's wrong about you.
Without serena van der woodsen
Who would i have dreamt about?
I might have spent my whole life on the outside
If you hadn't let me in...
Which i'm holding against you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
"Oh, my God."
"Oh, that makes sense."
Wait. they're a team.
Team of what?
Wait.
Why are you all here?
I got a text saying to meet you.
- Yeah
- So did I.
- So did I.
You wanted to meet gossip girl.
Well look around.
You just did.
I'm nothing without you.
And while most high school friendships fade
It's my hope that what happened today will bond you forever.

You have a clean slate...
Until college.
Congratulations.
I'm coming with you. oh.
- Drinks on me.
- Yes.
"Thou dost stone my heart, and makest me call what I intend to do; a murder... which I thought a sacrifice:"
I saw the handkerchief.
He found it then;
I never gave it him:
send for him hither;
Let him confess a truth.
- He hath confess'd.
"- What, my lord?"
- That be hath used thee.
- How?
- Unlawfully?
- Ay.
- He will not say so.
"- No, his mouth is stopp'd;"
Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't.
O!
my fears interprets:
"- what, is he dead?"
- Had all his hairs been lives... my great revenge had stomach for them all.
Alas!
He is betray'd and I undone.
"Out, strumpet weep'st thou for him to my face?"
"O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!"
Kill me to-morrow:
let me live to-night!
"- Hay, if you strive."
- But half an hour!
"- Being done, there is no pause."
- But while I say one prayer!
It is too late.
"My lord, my lord!"
"What, ho!"
- And so am I.
- And I to be here.
"Before I forget, I must give you Mrs Jennings' and Mrs Palmers' regards."
Oh.
"Miss Marianne, I hope you will not think me too forward, but I have brought you a gift."
- That lovely box.
- And its contents.
Please open it.
Whatever can it be?
"Oh, books!"
"Oh, thank you, Colonel."
It is only a very modest treasure chest.
"""The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire""."
- Will it not be too difficult for me?
"- Oh, by no means."
"You may find it even more exciting than ""The Mysteries of Udolpho""."
But I shall have hundreds of questions to ask you.
My children.
-You wanna get somethin' to eat?
-Nah.
"I had somethin' last night, ruined my appetite."
"Besides, I gotta get down the road."
Okay.
Thanks for the ride.
"Come on, I'll buy you a cup of tea and a bromo."
-Come on.
"-Okay, but I can only stay a minute."
Good.
"Okay, we open."
Come in.
-Where's the john at?
- Where was she hit?
- In the neck.
"- BP's 100/76, pulse stable at 100."
- Through and through?
- Saw one hole but it wasn't leaking air.
- You need a hand?
- Possible SCI.
- Where is he?
Ricky?
- What's her name?
- Alma.
"Hang in there, Alma."
We' re gonna try to find him for you.
- Set up a cross-table lateral of the neck.
- Carter.
Still got med students waiting.
Want me to jump on that?
Better idea.
You talk to them.
So.
"Newbies, huh?"
You don't wanna work here.
"- Haleh, get that dead body out of here."
- And take it where?
- Someplace else.
- How much O2?
- Five liters by nasal cannula.
- You hurt anywhere else?
They shot him!
"Oh, please, God, don't let him be hurt!"
"We' re gonna find out for you, but you gotta help us."
- Do you have pain anywhere else?
JOHN:
It's really green as hell.
"You know, I'm a country boy, John."
That's a bunch of crap.
You were born in L.A.
Mmm-mmm.
Malibu.
(SIREN WAILING)
JOHN:
What the fuck?
Howdy.
Dale Dixon.
"Welcome to Star City, boys."
"We've got a full day, so if you'll follow me we'll get you unpacked and get you something to eat."
"As soon as I saw you drive by,"
I knew you were the boys from California.
"(TRUCK HORN HONKING) Cops look the same everywhere, I guess."
Follow me.
(TIRES SQUEALING)
"Oh, shit."
WAITRESS:
"That's three scrambled and a cold Bud, whole wheat, sausages."
You boys are in for a treat now.
"Say, Fern, can you bring us some extra biscuits, too?"
"Sure thing, Hurricane."
"Some more coffee, too, please."
She call you Hurricane?
Folks call me that.
I never have figured out why.
I figure we can wait up in the woods.
"When the bad folks show up, we'll put the stopper in the bottle like that."
They'll be sorry they ever heard of Star City.
"Oh, my God."
"Oh, my God!"
He kinda looks like Josh Peters.
- It's Josh Peters!
You're Josh Peters!
- Sorry?
You're Josh Peters from high school!
From a guy I know at high school.
The system could be mining some of your personal memories for texture.
Was Josh Peters someone you were scared of?
He was a bully.
I wasn't scared.
"I wasn't scared of him, but he was a bully and..."
Man!
Take a couple of Krav Maga classes and I'd be ready.
I'd be ready!
Kali ma!
Dah!
I'm gonna get some wine.
Re-up.
"I'd offer you some, but I don't think you can drink it so..."
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
"Catch ya later, Peters."
This non-alcoholic wine is pretty good.
"I'm not like a expert or anything, but it's kinda great."
I was in France.
"I stayed at this, like, vineyard, and they had this wine, like, grape-stomping festival."
"Now that, that wine was good."
I know that.
You're being discursive.
- What is discursive?
Discursive?
- Yeah.
You do?
What should we do now?
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
"Oh, yeah."
Memory serves.
"Now that I have your attention, listen up."
"You do not come into my town, threaten people I care about."
Going after Elena?
Bad move.
You leave her alone or I will rip you to bits.
Because I do believe in killing the messenger.
You know why?
Because it sends a message.
[GASPS AND GRUNTS]
"If Katherine wants something from me, you tell that bitch to come get it herself."
[KNOCKS]
- Hi.
- Hey.
I couldn't sleep last night.
"You were obviously upset about something, and I just walked away."
That's not me.
That can't be us.
"You're my friend, Elena."
"If you need me, I'm here for you."
And I'm sorry I couldn't show you that yesterday.
I met my birth mother.
Oh.
Was it?
Are you okay?
[GRUNTS]
TYLER:
Here you go.
Brittany Gold.
Get out of the car.
I'm sorry about the tape.
Don't worry.
"Billy won't show it to anyone, especially not your wife."
Karl Stoltz is dead.
"You know who that is, right?"
Did you really think
I was going to let a bitch like you set me up?
I'm really sorry--
You know what?
I could run you in right now for the vials of shit that I know you have on your person.
- Fucking bitch!
- Aah!
Chain in or out?
"In, please."
"All right, listen, I don't know who's going to be there today, okay?"
- Yes.
- I need you on your A game.
- All right?
- Okay.
Laser focused.
Okay?
- Pee less.
- Right.
"Also, please learn how to tie your own tie because you're a grown-ass man."
"- Oh, well."
- [sigh]
"I'm so proud of you, sis."
What are you--
What the fuck is wrong with you?
I can smell it.
"You know, somehow Dawson and Skagway and... even California seem like places I've just heard of."
Seems as if I've lived out here in this wilderness forever.
Other people and other places... never existed.
But there's one thing I do remember... and that's a very kind and wonderful man.
I wonder what Buck sees in the fire.
"What are you thinking of, Buck?"
"Well, he's probably remembering more than thinking."
Remembering back to the time when he was more wolf than dog.
When there was only one law- the law we were just talking about.
"It's getting late, Jack."
Think I'll say good night.
"Not guilty, Your Honor."
Cabin!
- The tree!
- The mine!
"Oh, boy!"
"Hey, somebody pinch me."
That does it.
It's just as it was in the letter.
"My, oh, my, oh, my."
I do declare.
Hey!
"Hey, boss!"
Boss!
"Come here, quick."
Hmm.
Look at this.
"Oh, my."
Oh.
"Lookit, lookit!"
Tell me if I'm dreamin'.
Says...
"Emily Post, I've heard."
"Well, Emily post is also a divorcée, so she would definitely be on my side."
And a delicious man like that shouldn't go to waste.
Don't you want Paul to be happy?
Of course I do.
"Yeah, he's-- he's lost his wife, and you are recently divorced, so..."
So...
you don't mind playing Cupid?
"Also, certainly, a thank you to Coach Masters for his-- his help on the field."
- Paul...
- Yeah?
"You remember Stephanie, Jacob's mom."
Of course.
Hi.
How are you?
"You may not be aware, but Stephanie is, uh-- she's recently divorced."
"Oh, well, that got to the point."
To the--
"Oh, you're setting us up."
It was my idea.
I know.
"But at some point, I thought, ""Why be coy?"""
She's right.
"I mean, you're both single, you're both smart and nice."
Smart and nice.
Wow.
"Stephanie, can I offer you a refill?"
- Yes.
Thank you.
- You're very welcome.
Here you go.
STAYNE:
I cannot fathom it.NYou are far superior in all ways.
RED QUEEN:
I know.
But Mirana can make anyoneNfall in love with her. (animals GRUNTlNG )
even the furniture.
Even the King?
I had to do it.
He would have left me.
is it not betterNto be feared than loved?
Not certain anymore.
let her have the rabble.Nl don't need them.
I have you.
They're wonderful.
You must let me try one on.
It is good to be workingNat my trade again.
It's just a pityNyou have to make them for her.
What is the hatter with me?
Hatter?
(chains rattling )
(THUNDER crashing )
Hatter.
Have you any ideaNwhy a raven is like a writing desk?
Alice.
I don't like it in here.Nlt's terribly crowded.
Have I gone mad?
I'm afraid so.
You're entirely bonkers.
But I'll tell you a secret.NAll the best people are.
Here.
That's better.
You look yourself again.
It doesn't sit well with my policy of plausible deniability.
Let's get going.
I'll see you around.
"And by that I mean please, stay away from me."
"See you later, ghosts of staffers past."
"Madam President, I brought you Congressman Pierce."
"I brought him also, ma'am."
Richard Splett.
She already knows who you are.
You can go.
"No, no, no."
Not you.
Not you.
We're such big fans.
I'm a big fan of yours.
"Thank you, Madam President."
I am here to serve.
How can I help?
The president needs you to do something for her.
"And in exchange, she feels that you deserve a better job."
- Yes.
- Thank you.
"Ambassador, perhaps."
How does that sound?
Ambassador?
Me?
"Oh, wow."
Not what I was expecting.
What's your favorite city?
Dallas.
"I love Dallas, Texas."
"No, it needs to be a foreign city."
X-rays are up.
"-C-spine clear, mediastinum looks okay."
-Very good.
-So where are you registered?
-What?
-Definitely have to.
-Could someone get SonoSite?
"My ex-wife didn't, we ended up with clocks."
"With my sister, salad bowls."
Seven of them.
Does anybody mind if we just focus on the patient?
"Okay, then."
"Can we have that SonoSite, please?"
Neela.
Can you get away?
-We need to go get a license.
-We don't know where to get married.
-We do.
Hospital chapel.
-When did we decide that?
"-You were busy, I thought you--"
-And Jerry's gonna marry us?
"Yeah, he has some kind of minister's license, so l-- ls that really who we want?"
"What's Frank gonna be, the ring bearer?"
We don't have a lot of time.
I had to make some choices.
-Are you gonna choose the flowers too?
"-No, no."
"But you like lilies, right?"
"-Michael, we have to talk."
-About what?
-l think this is getting a little-- Dr. Gallant.
"Last year, Greg Hayman took me to a very nice sushi dinner."
Then we took a romantic walk to a nearby research lab..
where we trashed the place and freed 20 monkeys.
I knew it!
I knew I wasn't crazy!
"Last year, a monkey did attack me at the bus stop!"
"So between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross.."
it just isn't gonna happen.
It'd be like you falling in love with a cat.
-Hey.
-Hey.
"How's my favorite dog, huh?"
How's my favorite dog?
You're subdued.
-Did you give him a beer?
-No.
-Will you excuse us?
We need to talk.
-Sure.
"Oh, me, right."
-He's miserable.
What happened to him?
-Nothing.
-We talked about stuff.
-What stuff?
Rachel stuff.
"Oh, Joey, you bummed him out!"
This is the happiest dog in the world.
"He spends a day with you, and look!"
He's breathing.
"Okay, well, he's watching us so just look happy, okay?"
-I'll take him to Wendy's.
Mr. Yagami?
We were in the same class.
But we did not go.
"I saw him yesterday, to my work."
He had to return to that time.
I see!
Good!
Sorry for inconvenience.
The person whose name is written in the notebook dies
Cardiac arrest is systematic absence of cause in .
It's that 'an accident.
The small breakfast ready?
I am in a rush.
I do it on.
I want bread.
I freaked out yesterday.
Sakota
"During his run, he had a pain."
"Sometimes you what, Sakota?"
"It crashed into the train, and is the result."
"It's been what, in fact ?"
- This would be a heart attack.
- A heart attack?
This is not true...
This is not true...
I can not believe.
This is impossible.
No...
No...
Do not be sad guy.
- Huh?
- It was a night protection.
Judgment Day.
"Hey, everyone, Dermot O'Leary's about to defuse this bomb."
You ready?
Yeah.
Do it.
Return?
"Return, enter."
"Oh, shit!"
Jesus!
Oh!
Looks like we need a new mayor.
What in the name of Satan's arsehole is that?
!
"I told you to save him, not blow him up!"
"Sorry about that, boss."
Sorry about that?
!
Is that your fault?
"Well, it was O'Leary, sir, he, er, completely went for it."
He went rogue and started typing things into the computer...
I didn't go rogue.
"Anyway, you said you 100% trust me, I didn't go rogue."
"Oi, big boy, look at me, yes."
"Explanation now, yes!"
"OK, I thought the killer and the kidnapper was Miley Cyrus."
Did you?
Yeah.
"Right, why?"
"She had motive, there was a bypass going to go through the old people's home."
"I thought the old people loved the VHS, she knew her way around a VHS."
And the...
And the delivery of the ransom note was in VHS.
Yoon.
"Yoon, he said the crack doesn't look good."
It looks retouched.
The photo is unrealistic.
Okay.
One more thing
"I am sorry to bring this up, but you forgot to erase the finger of the guy who's lifting the athlete's leg."
Shit!
Don't try to make any excuses.
Shitty work is shitty work.
Shitty work because you suck!
No excuses will do.
Yoon.
Yoon.
Are you listening?
Yeah.
About Adidas.
The 2nd lot.
"The set with the girl, they want to take a break."
Who's doing it then?
Nobody.
It's just a break.
Just a break?
No such thing.
"Who is doing it, Je?"
Jerd.
Hello Peng.
"Hey, I heard you lost it?"
You heard about that?
"Even though I'm in another office, when Je got chewed out, I knew about that."
Accidents happen sometimes.
But some people who are hit by car once are handicapped for the rest of their lives.
I'm sorry.
You're sorry.
- I'm sorry!
- You're sorry!
- I'm sorry!
- I'm sorry!
- I'm sorry!
- I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
BOTH:
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry..."
Amy's almost here.
Any last words of encouragement?
Ignore all your instincts.
"Oh, my God, Clark."

The worst kind...
Long-form narrative.
"""Clark's Playbook of Scenarios to Help Jack Break Up with Amy""?"
"Okay, I'll give in."
It's my playbook of scenarios to help Jack break up with Amy.
"It's a little overthinky, right?"
"It's weird, but kind of sweet."
I wish someone paid that much attention to me.
Maybe there's someone that does.
And he's a lot closer than you think.
Have you tried... online dating?
"Damn it, Clark."
"Amy, I wanted to talk to you because..."
"Oh, I just thought of another crazy payroll story."
Buckle up.
"It was a Friday, of course..."
There's still due process.
"Out here, due process is a bullet."
I want you to keep that lighter.
It belonged to a medical specialist in Captain Coleman's team.
"After delivering a Montagnard baby, he was on his way back to camp and..."
His friends found him about 3 clicks out.
"Beheaded, mutilated."
His wife couldn't have recognized him.
And that V.C. In there did it!
That has nothing to do...
Tell it to Captain Coleman.
And shout it loud because Arlington Cemetery's a long way from here.

Next.
Now what is it this time?
That old ear bothering you?
Methiolate.
I'm not going to hurt you one bit.

Candy.
That's for you.

Want me to take a look?
Depressor.
Now that's a big boy.
(Phone vibrating)
Hello?
Who's this?
I can't believe I'm this fucking stupid.
You're not stupid.
"Hector, no, come on."
How's my little man?
He's good.
So go ahead.
Tell me to go fuck myself.
Tell me what a fucking bitch I am
Because I don't know what a good man I'm losing.
That's not what I was gonna say.
I will tell you this...
I wish we had more time.
"Somebody needs to go there and stomp that nigga, son!"
Entiende?
"Yeah, he lives up on Webster Ave,"
Right by my cousin Tina.
"Just say the word, E. Man, okay,"
"And it's done, we got you, man, we got you."
"You don't have to worry about shit, entiende?"
"(Man) We gonna fuck him up, E."
I'll handle it.
"Oh, shit, this mother fucker's gonna do"
Some Lone Ranger type shit.
"Come on, man... talk to this motherfucker, man."
"Hey, you sure, E.?"
"Yo, I got it."
"What the fuck, man?"
"I don't know, B."
"Mira, Mira queing esta alli, Mira Que chulita!"
Off-ramp and a subway stop already budgeted for.
But I'm left holding the bag.
What are you complaining about?
The bag's full of cash.
Minus a year.
You can weather a year.
You can weather 1 00 years.
I've got partners.
You're my partners!
You're holding so many options on land...
... youcouldbuyBrooklyn.
You could probably buy Staten Island too.
"Would you excuse us, please?"
Of course.
I got an appointment anyway.
Good.
Then it works out nicely.
You sure BankExchange is all set?
We got everything we wanted.
Now you can get something else for me.
-What's that?
-My name out of the papers.
How?
"With $40,000."
"What am I gonna do with $40,000?"
Let me ask you a question.
"You ever heard of a cop with $40,000?"
Who wasn't crooked?
"A cop with $40,000 would make big headlines."
Say hello to Nettie for me.
I will.
-Take care.
- Did you ask if Maurice works there?
"Not yet, but it's an Arab club, so Natanel, forget your disposable forks"
- and take off your skullcap.
- Are you crazy?
- Or wait in the hotel.
- It's my right to wear it.
- What's that got to do with it?
- Don't shout.
- I'm not shouting.
"- Yes, you are."
"Fine, I'm shouting."
Happy?
I know this music.
Isn't this...?
What is this place?
"Judging by the food, it's still a Lebanese restaurant-."
Judging by the hairdos it's Yemenite.
Israelis?
- They're onto us.
- Should I take it off?
- You're paranoid.
- So why are you whispering?
Tel Aviv?
Are you from Tel Aviv?
- Jerusalem.
- Why didn't you say so?
Menashe!
All Israelis are our guests.
We'll treat you like kings.
I'll get you drinks and we'll have a toast.
What's going on here?
"- Hey, isn't this song..."
And that is you will never see me dance.
I'll put money on it.
"One day, you'll dance."
Who's that out there?
Jude Cassidy.
Don't think I care for you.
I just need you alive.
"What do you mean, he's gone?"
Argument about the M25 got out of hand.
An argument with the M25?
You can't leave me here on my own.
"I don't know who to go to, Rose."
No sign of him leaving Mercer's flat.
I'll have to tell Lenny.
You'll sign Calum's death warrant.
Somebody's lying to me.
What's given can be taken away.
"Calum, let's discuss Jude's disappearance again, shall we?"
Pete?
Emergency services.
Which service do you require?
Which service do you require?
Hello?
"Hello, is anyone there?"
Hello?
- I didn't...
- What?
- Know anything.
- What didn't you know?
It wasn't...
You knew.
Whatever happened started inside.
There was some kind of fight.
He grabbed some scissors and chased her out here.
Find me the station manager.
I want a list of every employee that was here last night.
"Make that every employee, period."
"Yes, sir."
Any idea on motive?
I guess you could say that there were 12 million people with a motive.
"Myself, included."
This was the lotto girl.
She broke my heart three times a week.
What is that?
What is what?
On her fingertips.
Is that paint?
Yeah.
Looks like it.
"Hey, Gabby."
Take a sample from her left fingers.
Okay.
Excuse me.
Mr. Monk?
I have a nephew.
He's 10 years old.
He's your biggest fan.
He...
He clips articles.
He thinks you're cooler than Spiderman.
Really?
Kids.
"If I could get your autograph, he'd think I'm some kind of hero."
Why won't these people let me do my job?
I know!
What's that stuff you're always playingwith?
"""Silly Putty""!"
It calms me down.
"'Hobos on a Grassy Knoll""?"
I love them.
- They're the best band!
"- You know ""Hobos on a Grassy Knoll""!"
"Totally! ""The Americans"" is my favorite song!"
"That's impossible, no one in the States knows them."
I saw them when they went to London last March...
- in Cambridge.
- That's insane!
I was there!
Get out of here!
You were there?
That's crazy!
I worship this poster.
Where did you get it?
"- Well, I designed that, actually."
- Do you know them?
Bob Green and I went to Eton together.
"Paul, I've been looking everywhere for you."
"Everywhere except my office, I guess."
I heard you were in the shitter.
Roxanne needs you to discuss the concept for the cover shoot...
"Pardon me, Jocelyn."
"Hey, cut it out."
You can't go through his drawers.
- Does he not smoke?
What is this?
Okay.
Action.
Careful.
The kid's pretty messed up.
Kept talking about some broad called Nancy.
I guess that must be you.
To which she replies...
Ooh.
I'm Rose.
This is Nancy.
The Nancy.
To which you say...
Rose...
"Do you know, if one were 20 years younger and differently inclined, one might almost be tempted."
Cat-
- Catrin...
Catrin!
"Cat, don't make me run."
"They're always gonna be like that, aren't they?"
"Younger, in awe of you, like I was."
"Oh, come on, Cat, you had a choice."
You didn't choose me.
I'll come back in a few days and move my things.
"Oh, for God's sake, the flat's yours."
You're the one who pays the rent.
"Anyway, I'm going to Manchester tomorrow."
They decided to take the exhibition on tour.
"It's a success, then?"
It's a success.
I'm glad.
Hmm.
"You know, the first time I painted you outside the steelworks... maybe I shouldn't have shown you walking away."
"By erasing Simeon, you made space for me."
I fill him now.
"More than snow, more than Simeon - even this old body is strong in my control."
Argh!
Do you feel it?
Winter is coming!
Argh!
Winter is coming!
"No, you must fight!"
"Hang on and fight, boy, you can do it!"
Captain Latimer...
your children... they are afraid.
Hold them.
It's not really my area.
It is now.
What's happening?
Doctor!
The globe.
It's turning to rain.
"All of it, the snow, look."
He's dead.
What happened?
"The snow mirrors, that's all it does."
It's mirroring something else now.
"Something so strong, it's drowning everything else."
There was a critical mass of snow at the house.
If something happened there...
Salty.
Salt water rain.
It's not raining.
It's crying.
"The only force on Earth that could drown the snow, a whole family crying on Christmas Eve."
The Wu-tang Sword is really fierce.
Please stop or someone will get killed!
How come?
We're good friends.
"Mr. Wong, this way please!"
Let's go!
Shaolin and Wu-tang are really so fierce.
"Yes, Your Highness!"
I saw them fight myself.
Chin Kang Fist of Shaolin!
8-divine Sword of Wu-tang!
If only...
"Your Highness, that's easy!"
We have gyms of both martial arts schools here.
We'll bring them here!
Wait.
- Sung Chi!
- Yes!
Invite the master of the Shaolin martial arts school here.
I have an idea!
Cheers!
I've always admired Shaolin kung-fu very much.
"Especially your kung-fu, Mr. Liu!"
"Not at all, Your Highness!"
"I just know a little, you don't have to praise me."
I haven't exaggerated it.
Your fist is really marvelous.
"Of course, if my master's kung-fu wasn't good,"
I wouldn't be his student.
Shut up!
"Please excuse her, she's spoiled!"
She's right.
Tore it apart.
"All right, I'm on my way home."
"If he hit your place, he's probably going to hit mine."
Is Juliette home?
- No.
"- Well, don't let her go home."
- She's in the hospital.
- What?
What happened?
- Is she okay?
- I don't know yet.
But I can meet you at your place.
"No, you stay."
You take care of yours.
All right.
Then call for backup.
"Come on, work with me here."
I enjoy The Strand magazine as much as the next man but I am perfectly aware that Sherlock Holmes is a fictional character.
Get out!
Do you have a goldfish named Colin?
No.
Thought not.
Now...
Ooh!
I see this is one of your business cards - it says so on the front!
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
This.
"Wakey, wakey!"
"That is highly valuable equipment, you must step away now."
We are the Intelligence.
Oh!
"""Una poco de gracia. """
Shut up!
"For once in your stupid and pointless life, shut up."
"I'm in love, mate."
Do you know what it feels like to be in love?
Have you ever been in love?
That ain't a trick question.
Have you ever loved anybody?
Anybody whose name isn't Mercer?

Me gustan los churros y las chicos.
You forget about the sea sometimes.
Yeah.
Reminds me of biscuits.
Really?
Why's that?
"When we were just little kids, Mum and Dad used to take us to the seaside."
"Me and my sister would sit in the back, eating digestive biscuits."
"John, listen..."
I've never done what you do.
I know.
Just ask him for the time or a light or whatever.
You can do that.
I'll do the rest.
Do you want some fudge?
I've eaten tons.
I suppose I'd better save some for my mother.
You OK?
- This week she thinks it's 1935!
-
"- Oh, dear!"
Tell you what.
I'll p--pop over tonight.
"If she catches us cuddling,"
-- you can introduce me as Stanley B--Baldwin!
-
"- No, thank you!"
"Play your cards right, I can get you a place on my cabinet!"
Or maybe in my sideboard!
I'm going to work.
Come over later and I'll get supper.
Lovely.
I'll b--bring a bottle of wine.
W--Wear something comfy.
"As we're almost related by marriage,"

G--Granville!
Fetch your toolbox!
"Oh, dear."
Where's y--your vest?
What are you doing out without a vest?
"Now, don't start."
I'm finished with all that clobber.
Nevermore.
No.
No.
Here you go to believe.
"Do not believe this about me, major lord!"
Towards a dawn Mariska's limbs started becoming stiff.
Ágika was refreshed again.
He was Tót in the baddest state.
His brain rumbled.
His sense organs stopped working.
He hallucinated.
It was light.
"I think, his time to go to bed."
This was superb one.
We felt very well.
- I hope for it tomorrow we continue.
- Of course.
Good night.
- Good night.
- Major lord.
Sweet dreams major lord.
"Sleep tight, Ágika."
Mom.
He kissed my forehead.
What do you say to this?
"We have to go to bed, my sweet good Lajos."
"Ow, my Gyula, my Gyula."
My small son.
"Well, not wonderful, mom?"
He was not tired.
"With regret inform it the Hungarian Red Cross, that yours son, Tót Gyula is an ensign in the fight against the enemy, died a hero."
(Field post 809/3)
Would you please just admit it?
I taught you about loyalty.
I fought tooth and nail with your mother for your custody.
Me.
Good old Dad.
And I am not the kind of man who would hurt my family.
"Now, I am disappointed in you for even thinking it."
"L""m hurting."
"Oh, my God."
"Daddy, you""re lying."
Lying right to my face!
"Oh, my God!"
- Keep your voice down.
"- How could you cheat, Daddy?"
How could you cheat on Clara?
Get out of my house.
"Clara, honey, patients are waiting."
"You know, Lisa hasn""t shown up in four days."
I guess whatever she has is contagious.
"- How""s David?"
- Fine.
- Are you okay?
"- Why wouldn""t I be?"
I fixed the scratch.
"The Mercedes the other day, I fixed the scratch... but now there""s a rattle."
"Driving to work this morning, it was rattle, rattle, rattle."
"L""m sorry."
"It""s all my fault."
"Of course it is, you son of a bitch."
"I mean, do you love her?"
- Do you love me?
- I want to come home.
"Once she starts, she'll never stop."
- How true!
"It's so different, seeing it in real life instead of just reading a book about it."
This goes on every evening at our place.
He just comes home from the orchard...
"Let's not forget, hydroponic agriculture only started in the 21st century."
Back in this century they couldn't even control the weather.
Gee!
My dad!
"- Bye, then."
- Bye.
Didn't I tell you to get home earlier?
What's that in your hand?
Give me it!
Fido!
Fido!
Adam!
Can you hear me?
I'm talking to you!
Give it to me!
"Dad, I didn't..."
I just...
Fido!
Dear God!
This dog is driving me crazy!
Look what he just did!
"You're the one who should look, at all these women!"
- Take it away!
- It's disgusting!
Wasting time on this instead of studying!
- My dear son!
- This kid will never amount to anything!
That land was already sold to the state when you planted your mine.
No one's taken that trail in 50 years.
Hauser.
But thanks for telling me where to dig.
So have you found the twin tree?
It's you.
You're here.
And so are you.
"Officer Hauser, the twin tree..."
any leads?
Not yet.
But I'm working on it.
- Day and night.
"- Well, I'm here to help."
In those shoes?
"Well, I thought we could start with you asking me to dinner."
I found the twin tree.
And Petty's last bomb.
So much death from something so small.
You know her methods?

- There must be something else you can do.
- To come down here and discuss your options.
- I will try anything... anything.
"I will try an experimental drug, uh, uh, more surgery."
"Uh, anything!"
I-I-I have to spend more time with my family.
I am not ready for this!
You...

You're sorry?

You're s-sorry.
"Mr. Janson, you need to wait in your room."

I heard there's a lobster truck outside.
I'm from Maine.
I-I can't pass up lobster.
"Oh, I-I can take him."
Hello.
I'm Jacob.
I'm a fellow traveler here.
"Uh, Larry..."
Larry Janson.
Do you like lobster?
"Well, my... my religion forbids shellfish, but I-I-I'd be happy to take you."

I'll call again.
Goodbye.

"It won't take long, just a minute."
Doctor Tarras?
I don't know if you remember some days ago you put me a tooth cap.
And... it's moving.
I'm sorry.
Didn't know it was that late.
"Alright, at the clinic."
I'm sorry for waking you up.
Goodbye.
Thank you very much.
Federico?
It's Max.
Were you having dinner?
"Well, don't worry."
It's not urgent.
"No, I just wanted to end the other day discussion."
Because...
I think you cut the conversation in a very frivolous way.
Yes.
You said I was a fanatic intellectual..
From the 17th century searching for the absolute truth.
Well...
I'm not trying to sermonize you.
I just wanted to end the discussion.
"Okay, go eat your dinner."
"Mother, go now."
And remember...
"If anyone give you food, don't eat."
"Those crimnals, they mix something in the food."
And then they steal all the stuff.
Don't tell your name to anyone.
"Keep that in mind and wait... 25000, you might need it."
"Enough mother, stop crying."
"You have the gun, Right?"
Yes mother.
"You have the ammo, Right?"
Yes mother.

Mother don't you worry.

It's Karolbagh's.

This is my wife.

"Why don't you take that note, give it to the American Consulate, and let's not get any more involved, please."
Why don't you get the key?
I'll take care of the driver.
Alright.
"Say, uh... you know a Mrs Drayton?"
- English lady.
- That's right.
Did you see her coming from the marketplace in the last hour?
"- No, sir."
- Wait a minute.
This is very important.
- She had my little boy with her.
"- No, sir."
- What about Mr Drayton?
- Mr Drayton checked out.
- He what?
- Checked out.
- But he couldn't have.
"- Yes, sir, he did."
"Mr Drayton, the Englishman with the horn-rimmed glasses."
"Yes, sir."
He checked out.
"(Sighs) I don't know about you, but I'm exhausted."
"I'll call Mrs Drayton, tell her she can bring Hank back."
"- Just hold that call a minute, Jo."
- Why?
Because I asked you to!
"Ben, are we about to have our monthly fight?"
I hope not.
"Well, then stop acting like that."
I merely said I was going to call Mrs Drayton.
Shit.

Start running on the spot.
This is good;

Let's get your seven hearts beating.
"Let's get your heartrate to over 3,000 beats per minute."
"Coffee, miss Gablechuck?"
"No, thanks."
So I'm sure you've heard about Heather Weather?
"Yes, that she was murdered."
"No, that she'd been shaving her age."
She's really 62 years old.
"Wh- oh, um..."
I'm not surprised.
You watch your job!
I don't understand him.
What's this man talking about?
"Come on, boys, don't be crazy."
Because of you all the gang is at a stand-still.
"-Boys, come on."
-No boys.

How does it work?
What's wrong with you?
"Well, what's up?"
Nothing.
I'm working.
"Well, you're working, but this isn't working."
You're right.
And does yours work?
I can't see a button anywhere.
Maybe it's centrally controlled somehow.

Without stepping on anybody's toes.
Yeah.
"You know, I love Rufus..."
But you're my dad.
He's not.
What?
"We're gonna hitch you up to Bessie, and you're gonna pull her nice."
You gotta be kidding me.
You start there where the road begins.
You finish down there where the road ends.
Holy shoot!
"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
How long is this gonna take?
"Well, fella does it right, should take him about five days."
Five days?
But I should be in California schmoozing Dinoco right now!
"Then if I were you, I'd quit yapping' and start workin'!"
"- Hook him up, Mater."
- Okay-dokey.
Freedom!
Maybe I should've hooked him up to Bessie and then...
then took the boot off.
Whoo-hoo!
"Goodbye, Radiator Springs, and goodbye, Bessie!"
"California, here I come!"
Yeah!
"Oh, feel that wind."
Yes!
No.
"No, no, no."
"No, no, no, no, no."

How can I be outta gas?
"Boy, we ain't as dumb as you think we are."
"But how did, how did... you...?"
We siphoned your gas while you were passed out.

- Are you ready?
- Yeah.
"Ready, set, go!"
"Hi, Harvard."
Going to invite me to the big game?
If it isn't my childhood sweetheart.
How are you?
Take a look.
Draw your own conclusions.
You've certainly improved with age.
Things must've been dull for you these past months.
You're right.
"Come on, let's take a walk."

"Let's grab some sandwiches, I've got a pint and go down to Crystal Pond."
"Hey, you can think for yourself once in a while, can't you?"
Okay.
"Hey, let's go get a hot dog or something."
- Okay.
- Good.
- Let's go swimming or something.
- Okay.
Okay?
- See that.
- What?
"Allison and Norman on their way to Crystal Pond to swim, all by themselves."
So what?
"They're young, happy, maybe in love."
What trouble can they get into?

"The same woman, twice, and she died both times, the same woman!"

Are you coming back?
Shouldn't think so!
But where are you going?
"To find her, to find Clara."
Ha-ha-ha!
But Clara's dead.
"What's he talking about, finding her?"
"I don't know, but perhaps the universe makes bargains after all."
Where are you going?
Short cut.
Through there?
I hate this place!
Don't you think it's creepy?
"No, I don't believe in ghosts."
Clara!
Oswin!
Oswald!
Watch me run!
Ha-ha!
Miss me?
Who the hell are you?
I'm the Doctor.
I'm an alien from outer space.
"I'm 1,000 years old."
I've got two hearts.
And I can't fly a plane.
"You're running away with a space man in a box, anything could happen to you."
"Me, when I go to the movies, it's just for the music."
And I'm in love with the prettiest babe in the world.
"Me, I've never been in love."
I've only been sick.
What's the difference?
Me...
I was locked up in a mental hospital.
"I was yelling in the streets, because my father, see, was put in jail."
- Did they bang him up?
- Five years times two!
- As for my father:
One times even equals seven!
- My name's Léo!
"You're kidding, that's my name too!"
But my father was top dog... a King!
- Mine was only a Prince!
- Mine was old school:
"Poet, Jew, writer!"
Me not...
"Hi, my name is Mickey!"
Delighted.
My brothers:
"François, how French can you get,"
"- Antoine, even worse..."
- Don't push it too far.
Ferdinand the Baron.
"This guy's just an idiot, can't you see?"
Wanna see her face?
What do you make of her?
She craves warmth.
You'll do it.
"I was there, gawking like the rest."
"A moment, please."
Get out.
Get out of my life.
Get out of France.
But you have everything you ever wanted.
And more power than you.
I'm your mother.
I am ruling scotland
For you...
Do that.
"And mind me, do it well."
"When I return to scotland, to our home,"
"It will either be because you have failed,"
Or because you are dead.
Mary:
"After dinner, your usual game of catch"
"With anne, james is going"
"To want your attention, too, with his reading."
I'll have him work on it.
You promise?
"Promise me, I mean it."
Promise me you'll try.
"One year of marriage, it isn't enough."
"Fight, francis, please."
I will give you children.
Don't give up on our dreams.
On the life we could have.
Such a beautiful dream.
no.
"No, francis, don't leave me."
Catherine:
So many years before them.
I found her.
"You know, there's a town car waiting for you at the airport."
I don't need a fancy car.
I just hopped on the bus.
Saved you some money.
So this cruise...
You just happened to have a layover in Seattle?
"Well, I've always wanted to check out the Space Needle."
I understand you can see mount Rainer from the top.
"Oh, really?"
Anything else you want to check out?
You gonna take me or not?
"I got back-to-back surgeries, ma."
You gotta give me a little more notice.
"Yeah, yeah."
I gave birth to five doctors.
I know the drill.
"I can wait, maybe meet your colleagues."
- Is that Mark Sloan?
- Yeah.
Mark Sloan.
"Oh, mrs."
Shepherd.
You look great.
"Oh, damn."
Catch up later?
"Uh, oh, perfect timing."
"Um, mom, this is Meredith."
"Meredith, finally."
Hi.
"My son has been acting like a dog with his favorite bone, hiding you away."
I hope you're free for lunch.
"Every time I come here, Every time, you two."
Don't you work?
"Henry, nice to see you."
"Hi, how are you?"
"Anthony, right in the front."
"Anything you need Henry, just let me know."
"Tony, thanks a lot. I appreciate it."
You gave them $20 each.
"Henry, this is with Mr. Tony, over there."
-Where?
-Over there.
"Thanks a lot, Tony."
Salut!
-What do you do?
-What?
-What do you do?
-l'm in construction.
They don't feel like you're in construction.
I'm a union delegate.
"And now, ladies and gentlemen the Copacabana is proud to present the king of the one-liners Henny Youngman."
How are you all?
I'm glad to be here.
"Take my wife, please."
I take my wife everywhere but she finds her way home.
"I said, ""Where do you wanna go for your anniversary?"""
"She said, ""I wanna go somewhere I've never been before. """
"I said, ""Try the kitchen. """
Dr. Wellsler is here.
Gave a guy six months to live.
Couldn't pay his bill.
Gave him another six months.
I love this crowd.
Scottie's going to say a few words.
~ Turn it off!
"~ Can we have you on the dance floor, please?"
Where is he?
Peter?
~ Peter?
~ Come on.
"Little Peter Magath, where is he?"
"~ Ah, there he is!"
"~ Go on, Peter!"
"Now, little Peter may not have been the smartest kid in the village, but he was the slowest."
I've got short legs.
"We used to think, Michael and me, that Peter had been dropped on his head as a kid."
~ I had.
~ We felt sorry for him.
"We worried about your future, Peter."
How's little Pete going to manage?
We didn't know you'd end up one of the richest sods in Newcastle!
"~ Did we, Michael?"
"~ No idea at all, Scottie."
"Should've paid more attention, then, shouldn't they?"
"~ Oh, they're only joking."
~ Hm.
Hilarious(!
)
"Now, when Peter came to me and said,"
"""I'm going to make my fortune laying pipe,"""
I thought he wanted to be a gigolo!
"~ What's a gigolo, Scott?"
~ Ask Michael.
"~ Gigolo, that's right!"
"~ Michael thought tonight was fancy dress, so he's come as a Danish porn star."
By the way she was really upset with me.
And Rosa?
I couldn't go to Rosa's place because her husband was there.
You didn't tell me that.
Truth is I felt offended by the failure of my marriage.
That's why I stayed at the hotel.
So absurd.
"-Quite absurd, yes."
Do you have any children?
One daughter.
Sara.
She kept her too.
I think that's great.
You tell me why?
We had terrible conflicts about Sara.
I started showing myself weak and falling back..
And all of a sudden I had to ask for permission to see my daughter.
(Praying)
Follow me.
She's much better now.
Jacoba!
Don't bother her.
Jacoba.
Who's there?
-I'm Máximo.
Máximo?
Did you come here from school?
I don't know what to tell you.
I don't know if your parents are at home or if they've left.
Have you eaten already?
"Jacoba, how are you feeling?"
Bad.
-El Paso.
-Where are you from?
-Philadelphia.
See we got the whole country representative.
-Right.
-It's the melting pot.
And this chicken is Miss America of the eighties.
"No Jimmy, you are."
No.
I think Margaret is Miss America.
I think it's Jimmy.
You just say that because you're gay.
Oh he's not gay all the time.
I seriously think Jimmy is the new Miss America.
He has all the mannerisms of a sex symbol.
That's what we should call this make it a series.
The two miss Americas.
Great idea.
And we could end it with the two of them fucking.
He can't fuck.
I can too fuck.
I just can't fuck you.
You two are just too chicken to be photographed fucking.
Chicken woman.
He's the chicken not I.
"That sounds like a challenge to me, Jimmy."
You're just a chicken.
You're just a chicken.
Please don't start on me now.
You look tired.
You look old and ugly and washed up.
Stop it!
"No hat, no problem."
Another score for the cat fan.
Hey.
Hey.
Want some necklace?
"How about you, man?"
Ew.
You got it all spitty.
Tastes better that way.
Good.
"Hey, Harriet, what are you writing?"
Notes.
Can we read them?
Can you read this?
"Okay, okay."
I just wanted to know why you're always writing like a maniac.
I want to remember everything.
I want to know everything.
"Well, you must realize, Harriet, knowing everything won't do you a bit of good unless you use it to put beauty in this world."
True or false?
True.
Of course it is.
"Harriet, your mother called."
She's going to be late.
"Come on, Sport, Janie."
I'll have you home before dinner.
Golly always takes us places.
She sees things other people barely notice.
She's my nanny and...
"well, she's Golly."
"Okay, survey of the day."
Today's question is:
"Well, good."
I'll deposit it and bring you your receipt.
"Now, that's twenty thousand shares of Wentworth Drug at two dollars."
That's right.
Looking for a stock to buy?
Why?
Do you know of a good one?
Have you heard of Wentworth Drug?
I don't use drugs.
How much does it sell for?
Two dollars.
I never buy cheap stocks.
"Well, this one may become expensive."
Somebody just bought twenty thousand shares.
"Yes, so I see."
"You just bought twenty thousand at two, Mr. Sabourin."
Thank you.
You bought it.
What if it goes down to a dollar?
Then I'll buy more.
Look.
Still think it will go to a dollar?
I've got to get some.
Mr. O'Hara!
"Yes, Mrs. Ryan?"
Get me fifty thousand shares at two.
You'll never get it at two.
Not after that announcement.
Look!
Three and a half...
Three and five eighths...
Three and seven eighths.
Maybe later.
"What do we got, McGee?"
"How about you, Agent Gibbs?"
When was the last time you made a good snow angel?
'Cause it's... it's snowing.
McGee.
NTAS just issued an alert:
possible terrorist chatter.
They pick up chatter all the time.
Subject is northeast U.S. airports.
"Attention, passengers-- due to extreme weather conditions..."
Oop.
Sorry.
Uh...
"Oh, hey."
You again.
"Look, about before, uh, my husband has quite the chivalrous streak."
Uh-huh.
"But, you know, now that I've run into you again... do we know each other?"
I feel like we've met before.
Yeah.
I don't think so.
Has that ever happened to you?
"You see a face, you just can't place it?"
"Not really, no."
Oh.
"Delays are a drag, huh?"
Where you headed?
Home to see family?
Paris.
Business.
"Ah, Paris."
Is this your house?
It was.
I'll tell you all about it.
But first... did you bring the flower?
I couldn't find it.
That's okay.
"But since you don't have it, I'm gonna need that kiss."
"*Theystareatme* * while I stare at you * * aah-aah-aah * * it's true, I crave you * * it's true, I crave you *"

Stiles... you make a good Batman.
Youknowwhoitis.
Jackson.
"YoujustwantedErica to confirm it, didn't you?"
I'm gonna help you stop him.
As part of your pack.
"If you want me in, fine."
But we'll do it on one condition.
"We're gonna catch him, not kill him."
And?
Andwedo it my way.
"Thankyou,Jenna."
"Thanks, you guys."
I appreciate it.
Please...you have to tell him.
DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES
Hello?
Elizabeth?
SHE SOBS
The policeman...
He came back.
Where were you?
"Don't lie to me, Elizabeth."
Number five.
What did we agree about going upstairs?
Something bad always happens when you go upstairs.
I'm sorry.
Did he see you?
"The policeman, did he see you?"
I hit him.
I had to.
I had to get out of there.
"One day we're going to have to find a way to give all this back, aren't we?"
"I'm sorry, Mr Sellers."
Shh.
Get some rest.
"Peggy, where the hell are you?"
Call me back.
The poster design meeting with Elaine Markham and Peggy Scott?
"I'm so sorry, my partner's been delayed."
"OK, that's not a problem."
Jesus Christ!
I almost registered you as a missing person.
"I bet you didn't, though."
"Well, we didn't get the contract."
Probably not surprising as half of us didn't even show up.
I don't care about the stupid contract.
I...
I think what you're doing is wonderful.
You came to see him?
He'll be here.
Just have to wait.
Come here.
Come here.
What's the matter?
Something wrong?
Myocardial metastases.
Cancer of the heart muscle.
"Super rare, right?"
They wrote an article about me in a magazine.
"It's in my room, if you want to see it."
"Apparently, I could croak from one day to the next... from one minute to the next."
- Jeremy.
- Nathan.
"What do you do, Nathan?"
I'm a lawyer.
Do you know if he's going to be long?
"The first doc I saw, you know what he called it?"
"""Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy."""
Wow.
Can you believe that guy?
"You and me, we're gonna slap that that son-of-a-bitch with a lawsuit."
What do you say?
"Legally, that's not exactly my bag."
"Jeremy, hello."
- Up already?
- Yeah.
- Happy birthday.
"- Yeah, thanks."
What do you think?
Excellent!
You're very much appreciated.
You are flattering me.
Of course not!
Look.
"The blind is being touched by you, he is crying."
"Your Honour, if there isn't anything special, I request a rest."
For I have an eye problem.
You see pus from my eyes?
"Jury, have you reached any verdict?"
Yes.
Unanimous?
Yes.
The jury has pleaded the accused guilty.
"As stipulated,"
the accused should be hanged.
Court.
Wait.
Thank you for taking care of me.
This chicken leg is for you.
Sir.
"You kill me, but many many Ho Foons will appear."
Sir.
Wait.
"Your Honour, what punishment Ho Foon should receive?"
He is stipulated to be hanged.
It's alright.
Yan.
Let him down.
What do you want?
You just ordered to hang him.
Everyone report to the parachute issuing room in half an hour!
Sirl
What's that?
Oh.
One of the girls wrote it.
"""..."
Let no parachute sidle or slump...
"""For today we go warring together,"
"""And my soul..."
"""...will be there at the jump."""
It's rather good?
"I wouldn't know, poetry is not in my line."
Why do you always have?
Stop talking there!
Right.
"Out on the tarmac, you men."
Move yourselves.
Let's begin.
Deck 'shun!
Quick march!
"Company, halt!"
"All right, fall out."
I'm sorry for the man who hears the pipes and who isn't born in Scotland.
Standby to enplane.
Enplane.
"Climb aboard, boys."
Good luck to you.
I'll see you back at the camp in the morning.
"I hope so, Sir."
"Listen, everybody."
This is Flight Sergeant Box.
He's our radar dismantling expert.
It's all clear!
"Shooters, with a magazine of 20 rounds, as you were, and a magazine with 30 rounds!"
"Shooters, you may commence fire when you see your target!"
"Shooters, it is time."
You're gonna stand.
What are you doing here?
"Uh, just, uh, checking for drainage problems."
Out here?
"Uh, you know what?"
"It's okay, 'cause, uh, I'm with septic."
He's got a ca--
Quiet.
Quiet.
Quiet.
Quiet.
Quiet.
Is somebody out there?
Go.
"Go, go."
Give me your jacket.
"- Go, go."
"- Come here, come here."
Okay.
Go.
You are being read into the Have Blue program.
This is a top-secret U.S. government project administered by the Department of Defense.
You must have some pretty powerful friends to get us here on a Sunday.
To get us here at all.
We're not supposed to be talking about this to anyone.
Not even our wives.
They have people watching our wives.
You know that?
Going out with Alice?
Where's Henry?
"Uh, I don't know."
Alice probably called him.
We'll probably meet up.
Probably?
It's not a big deal.
Are you leaving out Henry for some reason?
No.
You and Alice dating?
Got plans to sleep with her again?
Dad!
No.
"We are not dating, exactly."
And I do not have plans to sleep with her.
"But if that were going to happen, you wouldn't have Henry around."
"Oh, I'll call Henry."
Henry doesn't know you slept with Alice?
No.
He does not.
And I'd like to forget that ever happened and so would Alice.
Let me make a suggestion.
"Hang out with Henry, or Henry and Alice, not just Alice."
You slept with her.
She's not just a friend.
"Geez, Dad, what is going on here?"
What is going on here is I think you might be sneaking around trying to see Dylan.
Where did that come from?
I'll tell you where it came from.
Dylan's father.
"He called me asking about Henry, if I know Henry."
Dylan's going out with Henry tonight.
Couldn't you put your foot down?
Forbid the banns?
Something like that?
"When the parson says, ""Speak now or forever hold your peace""... couldn't you give him a roar, sir?"
You know what I mean?
Higginbotham will replace him.
Dismissed.
"- Tommy, I've got you back again."
- And I've got you.
"I'm here to stay, forever and ever."
Forever and ever.
That's horrible.
- She's charmed him like a snake.
- The siren.
Wouldn't believe it if I didn't see it with my own eyes.
"Me, neither."
I can't stand it.
"Me, too."
Left!
Right!
Center!
As you were!
"Company, attention!"
Right turn!
Two paces forward.
March!
"Head up, chin in."
Get those thumbs behind the seams of your trousers...
Get them back.
Lower that left shoulder an eighth of an inch.
That's much better.
"Otherwise you're looking very regimental, Din."
Male here.
I'm going up in the white building on the right.
"Gimlet, understood."
There you go!
Course Fixed...
Jin here.
The rockets on the intersection are deployed.
Ram here.
Sniper point secured.
Over.
You were fast Ram.
Finnish the preparations and stand by.
Yankee... can you give me position status?
The enemy is moving to the east.
You'll be able to see it when it goes out to the street.
You'll be able to shoot a hellfire?
As always...
Ok.
Wait for mi instructions.
"Male, how's going?"
Male here.
I'm moving.
Three drones on the air.
Understood.
"Jin, report status."
This is the last one.
"When this starts, they will fly to the objective."
Keep going.
Yankee.
Over.
Yankee here.
Drop the hellfire immediately.
Have you got money?
This is most important.
No worries.
What do you think?
Walk!
Get on your knees!
It's funny...
Are you deaf?
OK!
Take me back to Paris to talk with Jorkalom and you'll money!
"That's what we've done already, and you blew it."
"Listen, I..."
Are you still ga and missed!
"No, no!"
Jorkalu gonna go away.
Say He'll not joking.
"That we will kill you within the next time and throw in his backyard, in front of his wife and children!"
Here we go.
Look at this!
I think I found Thomas Riffauta.
Let's see.
I think this is it.
"No permanent residence. 1.72 m, few sentences, but nothing serious..."
That's him.
He was with Sophie Mazerat and Hugo Rozier.
They were there when the bomb Rozierovim exploded in his hands.
I just saw him in that neighborhood with a black guy.
-Kidding.
I saw him in the squat!
Maybe just buy drugs.
Where did you get his name?
From Joséphine Karlsson.
- Then what's in Algeria?
- Nothing.
But you just started to say something about Algeria.
Nothing.
We were kids in Algeria.
I don't remember a thing.
Everyone only asks about her.
"""Pretty Jonah, pretty Jonah."" What about me?"
Why don't you ask about me?
What if I'm sick?
Are you sick?
"And where's your husband, Dorona?"
Why isn't he there?
And why don't you let your father mourn with you?
Was it nice of you to throw apples at him?
Did you hear that?
I'm going to bed.
I'm going to shower.
I'm going to die.
What now?
Nothing-Count me out-.
"I'm an orphan, I don't want to be a bastard, too."
What's up?
- Is Natanel here?
"- Yeah, over there."
Do you always have to be late?
I have a teachers' meeting.
- You brought water from home?
- Yeah.
Happy?
"Watch what you breathe, the air here isn't kosher."
"Cut the religious crap, Natanel."
It's ridiculous.
Maybe it's a sign you have to keep it.
"No, Mum."
"It's not a sign, I'm going to sell it."
Again.
Are you serious?
Are you selling this car?
"Ah, yeah."
Sold.
Sorry?
I'm buying it.
It's... it's got rust.
"Yeah, of course it does."
What car this old doesn't have rust?
"Tom, can we take it out?"
"What was it, Tom?"
"""Nice smile, mentally stable."" Ssshh."
I don't want to listen to another word.
Previously on The Fosters...
I gave the money to Ana so she'd change her story.
- You bribed her?
- I'll tell the DA.
"- I want $10,000."
- That freaking woman.
I could kill her.
You are gonna stay as far away from that woman as possible.
You saw Ana Gutierrez in an argument the night that she went missing?
- Is this the guy?
"- Yeah, this is the guy."
- Donald isn't my dad?
- Not according to the birth certificate.
He just wants to show off.
Give me 30 of that!
How much is it?
- 15 Mark.
- 15...
"Here, 20 for you."
Keep the change.
"Give me something to drink, I'm quite thirsty."
Life is just wonderful!
"Ah, Reinhold!"
Let me introduce you:
this is my friend Casanova from Casanova.
Make room for him!
Meet these 3 beauties from Pankow.
"Move over, I wanna talk to my friend."
"Reinhold, it's always a pleasure to see you."
No you gotta put him on a radiotor to warm him up.
What's the matter with you?
Don't get mad at them.
"Go away, children, go!"
"I tell you, women are trouble."
"But at home, I have a wonderful one."
A gem!
Then why don't you bring her along?
You better leave the woman you love at home.
They're just too curious.
Now what?
"They do nothing but steal and cheat, these criminals!"
- Criminals?
- And Franz is starting to scare me too.
Franz?
He was in jail already.
- Sorry.
I think I took the last one.
And the bread?
All we have are the ends.
This is like The Hunger Games.
"You do know those books aren't actually about food, right?"
"Sorry, guys, I'll hit the market today, I promise."
- Good morning.
- Morning.
Are we out of... ?
- Everything!
"- Bacon, we've got bacon."
Have some bacon.
Come on.
I made it last night.
I want everybody home for family dinner tonight.
- Five p.m. Yes?
- Wrestling won't be done...
- What about dance?
- Do I hear six p.m.?
Anybody?
"I have work, I was just gonna eat there with Daphne."
But I will eat here instead.
"Um, I'm supposed to go to the batting cages with Connor."
"Batting cages, as in baseball?"
"Yeah, Connor and his dad go all the time."
And they invited me.
"I think that's great, sweetheart."
I never knew you were a baseball guy.
I haven't really played that much.
"But who knows, maybe I'm really good."
"- Yeah, maybe."
Come!
Mada mada da ne.
That'll be all.
Good afternoon!
Captain...
"Playing a match without approval, twenty rounds around the court."
But I-
Forty rounds.
Yes.
The rest of you start your high-intensity training.
The first years pick the balls.
Yes.
You're the team captain.
Please give me your guidance.
I will join next semester.
"First, hand up a registration form."
"Ah, okay."
Oyaji.
"Oh, Ryoma."
"Gave me a scare there, what're you doing here?"
Is your mother doing fine?
It's outrageous.
What were you thinking leaving our hometown?
It's called Seishun Gakuen.
Nothing spectacular.
"Why, don't like it?"
"Don't tell me that to get me into that school, you brought me here all the way from the States?"
"Well, you can say that."
How about it?
Let's have a game.
Here then.
I'll crush you.
And we'll see who's full of what.
"Truth or Dare, Gemma?"
Pick one.
Truth.
Who do you think sent the postcard?
- I don't know.
- I want your honest opinion.
"Honestly, I don't know."
Big bastard!
Let's try that again.
"In your honest opinion, who among the people gathered here do you think is most likely... to have sent the postcard?"
Chris.
"Oh... oh, Gem."
"I'm sorry, I didn't know who else to say."
"Well, she doesn't know, Justin."
She's saying it because she's scared.
Gemma dumped Chris because of Felix.
- Maybe he wanted revenge.
- That's ridiculous.
While we were driving you just said you wanted to hit him.
"- Yeah, I wanna hit everyone!"
- Did you send the postcard?
I did not.
Fuck!
Wait.
What was... what was the postmark?
What was the date on the card?
"7th September, London."
"I was in fucking Spain, you tossers, three whole weeks."
"Paul, Paul, you can vouch for me."
The first week of September I couldn't go to the lakes because I was in Spain.
"He's right, he was in Spain."
Either that or you don't know what's funny either.
I... don't know what's funny?
"I'll have you know, at camp,"
"I was voted ""Miss Whimsy""."
"Why, was Miss Irony killed in a canoe accident?"
"Hi, Dick."
"- Oh, uh, Mary."
Just doing some reading.
"Some physics reading, you know."
Okay.
"Say, uh, an amusing joke just came to me you know, out of the blue."
"Knock, knock."
Okay.
Who's there?
Who's there you say?
Nina!
Nina who?
"Ah Nina, she's right here!"
Please let me host that fundraiser!
No!
- Oh!
"Ben Littmeyer just called, he's gonna be a few minutes late for lunch."
"Oh, another lunch with Ben."
I see.
How funny for you.
"Well, would you like to join us, we could make it a threesome?"
I don't go that way Mary.
Fine!
"And last but not least, garlic gum."

The 99 Euro Show!
"Toni, there is no show."
You're joking right?
That's a joke?

Yes.
I forgot my glasses.
I can't see the keyboard.
Then get your glasses!
God damn it!
Now go!
"Sure, sure, ladies and gentlemen, of course you all want to see Nora again."
"Well, before we get started with the quiz show, here once again is Nora and the Pope dancers!"
Me again?
Yes.
Now what?
"It doesn't matter, just sing it again."
"Once again, from the top."
Everything gets to the point where I just say stop.
A lively hotel.
It's dinner time.
Everyone's dressed up.
The first guests are taking their seats.
And now we're going to the cafeteria.
If I were him I would do the same thing.
What's going on here?
We're having a going-away party.
It's probably for the best.
What?
That your brother takes a vacation.
- Can...
"Can we think about going to the doctor, please?"
Oh.
"Edwin, did you hear my grandson?"
He says I have to go to the doctor.
Is that so?
I was a doctor for 47 years.
How do I look?
"- Oh, okay by me."
Yeah.
- [Chuckling]
- Appointment done.
"- Meemaw, please."
Have something to eat.
The steaks are a buck.
I'm not hungry right now.
Why not?
Is there something wrong with you?
"No, I just..."
I promised Mom that I would take you to the doctor.
That's all.
I'm trying to be a good person here.
I'm trying to be a good son.
I'll tell your mom how fabulous you are.
I'm trying to show her that I have responsibility as well.
Okay?
But you're doing something responsible.
You're-
- You're elongating my life
Because you took me to have a good time with my friends.
- Yeah.
- What could be better?
All right. ls... er...
"'Janet Clark, please report to maternity.'"
"Lena, sit down."
Is someone after Saul?
"Lena, you can trust me."
You wouldn't believe me.
Of course I'll believe you.
- You'll think I'm crazy.
"- Just try me, OK?"
Nazis.
Nazis are after my Saul.
"You see, I told you you wouldn't believe it."
Wait. it's not that. it's just...
- Nazis?
Are you sure?
- Yes.
"I mean, how do you know?"
"Lena, of course I believe you, but... you just don't hear this kind of stuff in Hawaii."
Why would Nazis be after Saul?
Saul was a member of something called the Masada Team.
- Saul was an Israeli agent?
"- Tom, you know of the Masada Team?"
Yeah. it's a secret Israeli unit that locates and captures war criminals.
They got Eichmann and only they know how many others.
- I was in naval intelligence.
"- Oh, yes."
I forgot.
"If the Nazis were gonna murder Saul, why would they bother..."
- I'm sorry.
"- No, no."
You're right.
You're right.
"Cooper, do not attempt to remove that yourself."
Removing it yourself is extremely dangerous.
"Stop that, that could kill you!"
Just stay calm!
Is that Shou?
Is that Shou?
What's he saying?
What's he saying?
"Okay, Cooper."
We're gonna commence with deactivation.
"Oh, that's great news."
We need you to follow instructions and make it to the access point.
The access point?
Great.
Where the fuck's the access point?
"- Oh, fuck!"
More stairs?
Come on!
- Just one more level.
- Trust me.
- Okay.
Left at the top.
"- Okay, which door?"
- Room at the end.
What is it?
There's gonna be something behind there.
I can feel it.
- Something like...
- Like what?
Some personal fucked-up shit.
Like...
"I don't know, I could feel it digging around in my head."
"OH, YEAH."
OKAY.
"UH, MY NAME IS, UH, BOB FISHER."
"And what do you do, Bob?"
"I'M A, UH, I'M A LAWYER."
"Okay, Bob, is there something"
That you can tell me about yourself
That I can share with Christy?
"OH, I DON'T KNOW."
"I'M, UH, CAUCASIAN."

What are some of your hobbies?
"What do you like to do, Bob?"

"UH, NO."

My favorite kind of client.
"So, once you get there, you'll leave your money in an envelope on the counter."
"And once we know that everybody's fine, safe, happy, and comfortable, then we'll start the hour."
"And if you're not happy, all you have to do is call, and we'll make sure we'll make you happy."
We have plenty of girls.

"This is where it all begins,"
I've been dreaming you right.
I've been holding every night
Now you're wanting me to stay.
Keeps getting better everyday.
Everyday.
I'm so happy I could cry
I think about it all the time.
I'm so happy I could cry
I just can't get you off my mind
I found the reason for living
I found the reason for love.
I found the reason for living
Later.

Um it's pretty good.
There's a bit of drama though.
"He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me."
What are you talking about?
Where's that bonding strip?
"And another thing, stop with this spaceman thing!"
It's getting on my nerves!
Are you saying you wanna lodge a complaint with Star Command?
Okay!
"Well, so you wanna do it the hard way, huh?"
"-Don't even think about it, cowboy."
"-Oh, yeah, tough guy?"
The air isn't... toxic.

"Tell me, was that supposed to be a joke?"
Were you trying to get back at me?
- Lf you were...
- I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm talking about what I found in my book.

"- Oh, hi!"
I assume this is finally my iced cappucino.
- Yes.
And your change.
- Thank you.
Geez!
You really sucked that puppy back.
Are you sure this was skimmed milk?
[LAUGHING]
- So you still wanna have coffee?
- Absolutely.
"Oh, great."
"Okay, I really will stop gushing in a minute."
But when we walked out into that parking lot and I saw that you drive a Prius too...
[LAUGHS]
- I almost wept.
- I know.
I'm not alone anymore.
Oh!
"I didn't ask you, though."
"Are you married, or?"
Mm.
Divorced.
Are you kidding me?
That's fantastic!
My marriage was a miserable failure too.
No.
"No, actually we're still really good friends."
Yes.
I'm still really good friends with my ex-husband.
- You're kidding.
"- No, I am not."
- We are the exact same person.
- I know.
Let me ask you something.
Do you ever let your armpit hair grow out just to see how long it'll get?
Eww.
No.
Do you?
No.
Varun is one of the best visually challenged chefs...
Stop... stop
I feel shy to hear my own success story.
Will you please keep the book and leave?
You are taunting me too much.
Bye.
Thank you.
Don't mention.
Rhino!
Bake it.
Who is it?
Is the restaurant closed?
Yes.
Sorry.
The closing time is 10:30 PM.
An elderly man on the platform told that he was hungry.
He asked me if he can have something to eat.
There is no other hotel nearby.
That's why...
Please wait.
Let me check.
Somehow I managed this with the leftovers.
Take it.
Sorry for disturbing you...
I didn't know about your condition.
Nothing to sympathize.
This is my restaurant.
This is my job.
Okay.
Thanks.
You can visit the elderly man if you would like to.
He is nearby.
I don't have a cat.
You don't have a cat?
"Well, how do you explain this?"
"(STUTTERING) Well, uh, maybe the wind blew against it and knocked it over."
"Nancy, there's somebody in here."
Are you accusing me of hiding a man in here?
"I'm not accusing you, Nancy."
I trust you.
I don't trust Wilbur.
How can you pick on anyone as sweet and fine as Wilbur?
"I know him a lot better than you do, Bobby."
Leave me.
Wilbur is not what he seems to be.
"Oh, you found that out, too."
The first night.
First night?
"I know he seems kind of silly and awkward, but inside he has a fine and sensitive spirit."
"""A fine and sensitive spirit""?"
Wilbur?
I don't want to talk about it anymore tonight.
I've had a hard day.
Why don't you go to bed?
I will.
I will as soon as I take my shower!
(SHOWER STOPS RUNNING)
Wilbur?
Yeah.
Oh.
(EXCLAIMS)
(DOOR OPENING)
BOB:
Nancy?
"Well... well, forgive me, but, you don't return my calls, you completely cut me off, and then"
I...
I returned to find this...
I'm...
- I...
I'm...
- What?
Speechless.
- I guess you don't like it.
- Don't like it?
I'm in shock.
I...
I come home to find a completely different woman in my apartment.
Why did you do it?
Wait a minute!
Why do I have to EXPLAIN this to you or ANYBODY.
"- I'm not anybody, I'm your husband."
- You could've fooled me.
And I married a woman who looked a certain way.
"- To tell you the truth, I feel sort of betrayed."
- Betrayed!
Oh!
Please!
"Gregory, c'mon!"
- You had no right.
- I had no RIGHT?
Why did you do this to me?
Do WHAT to you?
I don't do ANYTHING to you!
That's the problem.
What's the difference what I LOOK like?
You never looked at me ANYHOW.
What a fine seat that fellow George has.
"Madame George Sand, dear."

Yes.
Your message was clear indeed...
between the lines.

"- Oh, balls!"
You're not in the army any more.
"You had an affair, not a pitched battle."
"Oh, MaIIefiIIe."
Poor boy.
It won't hurt for long.
- I know it must seem unfair.
- George.
- You promised to love me.
- I didn't promise to succeed.
- Whom did you come here to meet?
- No-one.

He should write his epitaph because I'm going to kill him!
Your rival is imaginary!
"If you're not going to help, go and find somewhere to sleep and leave me!"
Yes.
Right.
"Well, you-- you should go do that."
I don't want to keep you.
- Abby.
- Yes?
What are you doing here?
And why aren't you in uniform?
"Look, I really didn't want to talk about this here."
"I was gonna tell you all last night, but then I thought I should probably tell you at Sunday dinner."
"- Abby, you're rambling."
"- No, I'm not."
Isn't that that bitch from I.A.?
"Her name is Lina Flores, and she's not a bitch."
She's my partner.
"Well, she might be a bitch."
I don't really know yet.

Everybody choose what they do.
Mm-hm.

It'll do you wonders.
"See a volcano, drink a volcano, be a volcano."

Bringing Doug in tomorrow mornin'.
Great.
We can talk finally.
There's nothing to talk about.
You were right.
I was wrong.
I'm sorry.
"It isn't that simple, Michael."
"You think you can let the job be who you are... all you are, and you can't."
It's dangerous to think that you can.
I know I can be...
passionate...
- but I'm good at what I do.
- I know.
- It's no secret that things between us have been-
- Little rocky.
It isn't easy for me either.
"Evelyn comes along, and she's attractive... sweet, needy."

"Rip, this is Coral, Dusty."
What happened?
I don't know.
Don't you know?
I just woke up in my garage.
That's a great place to wake up.

See if you've got your money.
Just a minute.

His neck was broken.
My brain began to unscramble.
"Louis, Johnny's letter."
That was the joker.
Then Martinelli was tied to Johnny's death.

- Charles: goodbye.
We've got to do something about your...
- Your issue.

You need to be out looking for a job.
Stop trying to run away from your problems.
What?
!
"Come on, mom."
What are you talking about?
- Oh.
- Excuse me.
"Well, if you can't hear me,"
Maybe i need to write it down
So you can read it.
"you need a job, regina."
Tell me something i don't know!
Don't you ever raise your voice
And use that tone to me again.
i am your mother
"And i will be until the day i die,"
And you will not disrespect me.
"Yes, ma'am."
"I'm gonna go run now, ma'am."
Do i have your permission?
"Go on, regina."
"Lord, i ain't slapped nobody in 20 years."
They were tied with bows.
"I tried to grab on to them, but they kept popping away."
And then I started to sink... like a stone.
There was nothing I could do.
I was falling.
But it felt good.
I was letting go.
I was letting myself go and... all I could see...
was black... and all I could feel.
was the darkness above me and the lights... coming from below.
I knew I was dying.
And then
I heard this voice.
like somebody whispering in my ear.
"""Wake up, number 37""."
"""Wake up"""
And then I woke up.
What do you think that means?
Number 37?
I have absolutely no idea.
I met him.
The guy who told me about the plane crash.
You met him?
Yeah.
I met him.
"Last night, coming home from work about midnight."
I'm driving past the cement plant... out bythe chemical factory.
Right.
Something happened.
Bright...
Lightning.
Something encircles me.
"Hey no, no."
"Dont talk to me, madam!"
Why?
- I have stolen and sold all..
..thejeweIIery of little miss.
What nonsense are you talking about?
"Hey no, I am telling the truth."
I am telling the truth.
I am a thief.
Athief!
And why are you talking to me?
You should hit me.
Hit me.
- Krishna!
"Madam, I didnt feel bad.."
..when Vicky brother slapped me.
I even endured when sister-in-Iaw Naina called me..
..a dog.. a dog that but today..
"..today when sir slapped me, it didnt hurt me here.."
"..it hurt me here, here."
"What, he slapped you?"
-Yes!
"He not only slapped me, he has.."
..so asked me to leave the house!
"Now even I wont stay here, I am going."
"And listen madam, forgive me if.."
..unknowingly I have hurt yourfeeIings.
What is this that I am hearing?
You raised your hand on Krishna?
You told him to get out of the house?
What do you think can our Krishna steal?
Even if God comes down and testifies..
It's none of your business anyway.
No.
It is not slowing anything down.
These conversations are slowing us down.
I can't believe I'm listening to this.
That was totally patronizing.
Claudia.
It's lan McKnight.
Lovely.
"I don't know why you're so fascinated with our sex life but for the record, Jane's an amazing shag."
"More to the point, we're just about done with the single."
I'm sure you'll be orgasmic when you hear it.
Let's give the telephone a rest.
Cheers.
Great.
You're a fucking diplomat.
This is it.
It's going to hell.
Fuck her.
Who cares?
We'll take it somewhere else.
-You hire a lawyer.
-That's how I want to finish.
"-What, with a lawsuit?"
-No.
With that song.
-Which song?
-The song I just played you.
-It's a ballad.
-So what?
-You want me to hand them a ballad?
-That's right.
"Leave the dishes, I'll have Adrienne clean up."
"- They're here, Madam."
"- Ah, gentlemen!"
I've seen you before.
At Amsterdam Central.
That's possible.
Or someone else.
- l have an ordinary face.
- lt was you.
I don't forget a bod like you.
So we're going to tour around?
Whatever you like.
"You wanted to, didn't you?"
For your work.
I don't have to tour for my work.
No.
I wanted to have a chat with you.
A long chat.
- Privately.
- With me?
There's nothing I can tell you.
I'm just an ordinary boy.
I always write about ordinary people.
"As I said on TV, the ordinary man is my central theme."
All of him.
Above and below the belt.
"Yes... you've been on TV, haven't you?"
"And on the radio and in the papers, sure."
- ls it true what they write?
- What?
- All the goings on in the studios?
- What do you mean?
The red one.
Hey.
"I know you're depressed, so I brought someone to cheer you up."
"Right outside is a real, live, furry playmate."
I'm not sleeping with your friend Jane again.
"Hey, a dog!"
"Who, you gotta admit, looks a lot like Jane."
He's the happiest dog ever.
- Where did you get that?
- What?
- Combination.
- Personnel.
Pratt matched at County.
"Yes, I know."
He keeps bitching about it.
He needs a locker.
Thought I'd spare Elizabeth the chore.
Heard you had some trouble with Romano yesterday.
He was right.
I took too long making a decision.
You don't have that luxury anymore.
I never really thought I did.
Mark's gone.
That means you've been here longer than any other doctor.
People will look to you to step in and fill the void.
Big void.
"Yes, it is."
I can't do this.
Will you do this?
Thank you.
Shotgun to the face.
"This is gonna be fun, huh?"
"I'll miss you, Son."
"I'm sorry, Dad."
- You're fired!
- What?
Fire me?
That does it.
You can never be my son.
- A little to the left.
- Huh?
"Oh, very well."
You can never be my--
- Eeeeeeee!
- [ Gasps ]
"Sir, try to land on Leonard's carcass!"
[ Sighs ]
"Son, I know you're upset because you thought you saw us on TV... saying we didn't want you in our family..."
- but those were just actors playing us.
- How do you know?
"Because one of them hung out with me for a week, trying to get my character down."
"Yeah, me too."
That midget taught me a lot about his native Estonia.
"The point is, the real Simpson family missed you a lot... and we're really glad you're home."
[ Kisses ]
- I love you guys.
"- Right back at you, Son."
[ All Sighing ]
"And now I want you to meet your new brother, Hans Moleman."
"Cowabunga, dudes."
[ Kissing ]
Give it a try.
It's like kissing a peanut. [ Chuckling ]
[ Kissing ]
Who are you?
You jest.
You jape.
I am one of Britain's top comic talents.
"- Say something funny, then."
- Yeah.
"If you're so funny, why don't you say something funny?"
"Go on, say something funny."
"All right, then, I will, I will."
Erm...
Plop.
"- Oh, dear."
- Damn.
Mistimed it.
I'll have to get the manager.
Mr Forsyth!
"Listen, bitch, I was once continuity link man on TVS."
I don't see why I should have to pay for my food.
"Listen, dickhead-no money, no food."
Ah.
Ooh.
You're the sort of girl I could fall in love with.
"However, no time, because Richie?"
- Yes?
- Run!
- I meant through the door.
"- Oh, sorry."
I thought they'd never give up.
Mr Forsyth had some stamina.
Safe and sound now and time to get on with my wonderful dinner party.
That's what you think.
But I have been thinking.
So you didn't do anything to those women?
No.
Then where did you go every night?
- My part time job.
- Job?
Part-time?
So you bought meat with that money?
Yeah!
So why did you bring that dog here?
It's only skin and bones.
Not even worthy to eat.
Big trouble!
Big trouble!
Come out!
Your daughter and Mr. Hong...
Mr. Hong kidnapped your daughter!
Come out!
What?
I came here to take the plates back.
Hold on tight!
Stop the car!
Hey!
Stop the car!
Get closer!
"This motorcycle is so slow, what's wrong with it?"
Pull me up!
That damn bastard!
Is everyone still on?
"Dad, over there!"
I wasn't planning on killing you.
But you're just like the other bitches.
All hookers like you playing with all kinds of men have to die.
# He sang as if he knew me #
Will.
# In all my dark despair #
We're finished.
# And then he looked right through me # # as if I wasn't there #
"Will, come on."
"Will, we're finished."
"So there I was, killing them softly with my song."
"Or rather, being killed."
"And not that softly, either."
I was singing with my eyes closed.
Was I frightened?
I was petrified.
This was definitely not island living.
# Killing me softly #
# With his song ##
"Thank you, Finsbury."
I'd like to introduce one or two members of the band.
Marcus Brewer on vocals and tambourine.
And that's about it.
Let's get off quick.
Get off.
"Marcus, thank you."
For the song.
You were terrific.
- You think so?
- Yeah.
"As a matter of fact, I think we should celebrate."
Okay.
How about McDonald's?
- McDonald's?
- Yeah.
Um...
We think... we think... that you were shipwrecked.
[Imitates wind]
Oh!
And you managed to swim to shore.
"And somehow, you, um, broke your ankle."
You broke your ankle.
"Dr. Mead, um, the doctor, he thinks you need much rest."
[Speaking Polish]
[Kisses]
[Speaking Polish]
But you don't think he's German?
"- Oh, no."
- Just as well.
"[Mouth full, indecipherable]"
"- Oh, Ursula."
Please.
Sorry.
He seems to understand the language.
"- Oh, really?"
Since when did you speak German?
"Well, I..."
How is he?
"If he drinks any more tea, he's gonna need a chamber pot 'cause he ain't fit to walk to the bathroom."
You finished with this lot?
"Yes, I think so."
What's he gonna do without his clothes?
His own are ruined.
I thought perhaps some of father's might fit him.
"I doubt it, but you could try."
You want me to get the chest then?
"If you wouldn't mind, Dorcas."
It's Peter.
Right?
Yeah.
"And, Jeanine, can I just say that it is truly an honor to finally meet you in person?"
FOUR:
"Congratulations, Mother."
You got your war.
I know you wish there was another way.
But there isn't.
I'm the lesser of two evils.
Is that it?
You'd better be.
JEANNE'.
"Tell me, why did you surrender to Erudite?"
What do you want?
I would like a position in your regime.
"Ideally, I would like a position with some advancement opportunities."
(LAUGHS)
"I may be Dauntless, but I'm not just a meathead."
"No offense, Max."
(SCOFFS)
Prove your worth to us.
Then we can discuss your ambitions.
Great.
When do I start?
Let's talk about your friend Tris Prior.
How do I flush her out?
"PETER""."
Simple.
The girl's a walking bleeding heart.
She was born Abnegation.
That's her weak spot.
Only that you keep saying you'll be sendin' over the ending'.
It's almost ready.
Well...
let me know when it is.
Goodbye Parfitt.
Mrs.Cole
Excuse me?
I bet...you know!
just this way...
Cigarette?
I've never seen much point in men.
Still I do hate to see you plaining.
Oh!
I'm not plaining.
Ellis moved out weeks ago.
I'm already used to it.
It wasn't Ellis I was thinking of.
Forgive me.
"It's just the...when we were shooting in Devon, you always seemed so... vivid."
Perhaps I'm in a sentimental mood.
"My landlady was killed yesterday,"
I could hear her husband crying through the wall...all night long.
"It seems to me when life is so very precarious, it's an awful shame to waste it."
"I was wondering on page 76, I say..."
Getting worried.
About the ending.
Turned Ministry spy now?
Is that it?
Did I...
Sorry!
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean...
"- It""s okay."
- What am I gonna do?
"You are gonna lay in bed and you""re gonna cry your little eyes out."
"Then you""re gonna get up... you""re gonna put on a smile and go find those babies."
"And you""re gonna tell them, ""Mama""s here and everything is fine and dandy."""
"But he""s already filed for divorce."
"He wants the house, the cars."
"He thinks I""m having an affair with a woman."
- I have never cheated on my husband.
- I know that.
"- But he""ll win anyway?"
"- No, he won""t."
"- He""ll take my kids."
"- I won""t let him."
"- L""ll fight with you as long as it takes."
- It is too late.
He has pictures.
"Oh, my."
Who would take pictures like that?
"We took those pictures, Jesse."
"We""re knee-deep into this."
Let me see that camera.
Hurry up.
"- Jesse, what""s the matter with you?"
"- L""m sorry."
"Sorry doesn""t cut it."
Not for Pam Caine.
Hand me the binoculars.
"Jesse, you never get over something like this."
Never.
"Go see if the camera""s broken."
Mr. Rodriguez has had this appointment for weeks.
There's a lot of it.
"Okay, sure."
Be right back.
Why me?
Is everybody in your family a loser?
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Ow!

And now back to Colt Luger...
Classics.
"- Hey, Dad, Colt's back on!"
"- Hang on, hang on."
"Oh, Christ, who keeps turning this up to 64?"
"- Dad, it's cold."
"- Quit your bitching, Kevin."
Kids in Africa would kill to see their breath.
"You sold a friend of mine some bad pixie dust, Tinker Bell, that made him think he could fly."
But gravity's an hombre that never loses.
So slap on a bra because you're about to have a bad trip to the San Cortez Regional Correctional Institute for broads!
"See that, kids?"
That's the kind of man you want to be: self-employed.
- Do you remember at all?
Just over there where the lounge is.
- Do you remember anything about a rabbi?
- I don't remember anything.
Do you remember talking to a rabbi?
Or do you remember a rabbi... giving a talk about Max?
I guess I was in too much of a shock.
You don't recall any of this?
- I was in too much of a shock.
- Mm-hmm.
Must have been that.
Because he was my best friend.
I know.
We all know that.
We were very close friends.
"That wasn't when my daughter put me in here, was it?"
- When did it happen?
- Nine days ago.
Oh.
So I was here some time already.
"Oh, you"
- I think you've been here for a few years.
- Pardon?
- I think you've been here at Baycrest for a few years.
- Was I here a few years?
- I think so.
I think so.
"Yeah, my daughter never had time for me."
"- Why do you say that, Claire?"
- [Mutters]
Because she went to business.
And I was home.
"He already fired Pete, who is a great producer."
Fire Pete?
He can't fire Pete.
You know what?
I quit.
He can suck it.
Mm-hmm.
"Yeah, suck it, Pete."
"No, you're not listening."
You're not a good listener.
MAN:
20 minutes to air.
But Liz said we were cutting the cat-lady sketch.
She said it stinks.
Ouch.
This is why Liz is wrong.
Animal humor is universal.
I just don't think that I'm good in it.
Do you think I'm good in it?
I think this is your opportunity to go out there and prove everybody wrong.
What?
What do you mean?
Who's everybody?
"The network that wanted to fire you, the focus groups that said you had a weird eye..."
You mean this eye?
"Okay, this eye, it doesn't open all the way because when I was little, my sister peed in it."
Tonight is your opportunity to go out there and change all of our minds.
What?
!
Where is Liz?
!
Liz!
We're allowed to have a bit of a difference of opinion.
Tell me we're not rushing Dallas.
We're not rushing Dallas.
"You know what I'm talking about, right?"
"No, not really."
"Mel, Dallas is happening."
"I have job and it looks like you have a job too,"
- if you want it.
- Maybe I don't want it.
You said you did.
Things change.
People change.
- So you're not coming?
- That's not what I'm saying.
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying that I'm nervous.
- I'm getting scared.
- Doc?
Sorry...
Just hang on a sec.
- Mel...
- I have to get back to Nicole.
"Doc, the nurse says we got a green light."
He's all yours.
- Thanks.
- And Officer?
I've taken a strict inventory of Mr. Pike's injuries.
"There are detailed notes on every bruise, scratch, and cut."
OK...
"So if he ends up back here with a new injury, I'll know where it came from."
Get him out of here.
I don't see her.
I'm sorry.
I can't right now.
"Hey, Meredith."
Petty Officer Brian Smith?
Yeah.
There's a whole ship full of people looking for you.
May want to put a shirt on.
You're coming with us.
Stay with her.
Stop!
- Look out!
- Whoa!
I said stop!
Hey!
I know a dead guy with bruises just like yours.
Look at it.
"Oh, is that a little tough to look at?"
"Here, how about this one?"
Maybe a closer shot.
I didn't do that.
It wasn't me.
Says the guy who just ran two blocks to get away.
"I can explain everything, all right?"
"Oh, you can?"
!
"Well, thank goodness for that."
'Cause finding you in the dead guy's girlfriend's apartment with your pants around your ankles doesn't exactly scream innocent.
"In my business, it's called motive."
Think I killed him for Meredith?
People kill for a lot less.
"I woke up around 6:00, and Brian was pounding on my door."
Said he and Caleb got into a fight.
"I mean, of course, it needs a lot of work, but wow!"
I think I'm having goose bumps.
Oh!
The minbar can go right there.
And my office can be in that room with the family
- Of angry racoons!
- Yes!
Wow!
Wow!
Wow!
Why is there a team
- With a wrecking ball out front?
"- Like I said, the place is scheduled for demolition."
- [Together]:
Today?
"- Yeah, in 15 minutes or so."
"But don't worry, guys!"
I can find you a place exactly like this...
probably.
- Can't we stop them?
- No.
Only the mayor can stop the demolition now.
- How do you even know that?
- She likes to brag.
"You guys really want this place, don't you?"
- More than anything!
- Huh.
- OK.
You go find Ann and I'll stay here and make sure
- They don't tear it down.
- Brilliant!
[ Rayyan sighs. ]
Are you in his apartment?
Are you on the bed?
No.
I'm not on the bed.
- Is he there?
- No...
Not exactly.
Is he taking a shower?
He's getting take-out for dinner.
And this call's becoming very 1-900.
"To talk to a hot English teacher, press 3."
Call ending now.
- Tomorrow?
"- Yeah, tomorrow."
- Hey.
- Hey.
"- Sorry, it took so long."
- It's okay.
Looks like Rose of Sharon has been discovered.
Big crowd at the take-out counter.
I meet your dad tomorrow.
I know.
I was thinking this is gonna be a bit more complex than the usual parent-teacher discussion.
"I mean, I can see your mom as a colleague, she's safe."
But your dad is your dad.
Which is complex.
"You will like him, he'll like you."
Just be your normal incredible self.
What is he after?
He's probably just what he says he is.
A nephew cleaning up after a distant relative.
Probably?
"""Our love is just a mirage."""
"""Stay behind and don't go away!"""
"""Till death do us part!"""
"""But lt's only a fond dream for you have to leave."""
"""Our love is just a mirage."""
Bye-bye!
"Damn, Hiroshima escaped!"
Bye-bye!
I'll go to Japan to stop him!
"No need, it's only a small matter."
Small matter?
You traitor!
- What?
- l beat you.
Why did you hit me?
Why not!
The whole world's destroyed by you.
You're the sinner of all mankind.
- l'm sorry!
- Why hit her?
And me too?
Why did you give the Formula to the Japanese?
What are you laughing at?
"Don't worry, Hiroshima never got the real 'Beast'!"
Then where's the real one?
The real one's right here!
"Well done, Yoyo!"
I can see the money already.
We can go on a trip tomorrow!
Shush...someone's about!
Come out or I'll shoot!
Come out quickly!
My dad thinks we should get off the streets.
Why?
He hear something?
About aftershocks or looters--?
Zombies?
That was my first thought too.
"But, no, it's just a precaution."
-It's Ryan.
-ls everyone okay?
"Yeah, we just have to make a little change of plans."
-Your dad said to go home.
-I think we should all be together.
-This is a bad idea.
-We're almost there.
"-No, we're not."
-Just a few more minutes.
"What is it, honey?"
I can't get Barbie into her dress.
"Well, she can wait a minute, don't you think?"
"No, she needs you right now!"
(NlNA whining)
She can't bang on that xylophone thing when I'm working.
That is so true.
"Here, all yours."
"I'm making dinner, can you just manage with Nina for 20 minutes?"
"I've got a deadline, okay?"
connie:
Barbie's going to be late.
"What is she late for, angel?"
"Her party, she's going to be late, she's going to miss everything."
(singing) I see the moon and the moon sees me
And the moon sees somebody I'd want to see
Mush!
Mush!
"- What's up, Sergeant?"
- They just brought a fellow in.
- Picked him up on the Skagway Trail.
- What happened to him?
It seems like he left his sled to go hunting for food... then couldn't find his way back.
He was almost a corpse when they found him.
- What's his name?
"- Well, we found these on him."
Name seems to be Blake
"- John Blake, San Francisco."
Here it comes.
"Say, it even looks like a raft."
Thanks.
I always wanted to join the navy.
"- Will there be room for the dogs, sailor?"
"- I'm afraid not, matey."
- They'll have to run along the bank.
"- Very well, sir."
"Be careful of that varnish on the deck, you two gobs."
"Step right in, commodore."
All set?
"Shove off, cabin boy."
Ca-
"Toot, toot!"
Hard aport!
"Come on, Buck."
Come on.
"The way I figure it, we go 100 miles upstream... then we follow a creek that runs into it north."
Huh!
Never fails.
I just don't like the idea of somebody liking me because of this and not because of me.
And it's hard to detract and think:
""" If I didn't have all this, would this person like me or not?"""
"Come on, ladies and gentlemen, in we go."
Show starts at 8:30.
Get involved.
"Come on, inside."
Get your T-shirts and your drinks and stuff.
"Get in, come on."
We got a show to put on.
We're going to try and fool the fans.
So 'm gonna dress up as a security guard  who works at the O 2.
holy moly.
Are you meant to be sitting there?
"girls, you're looking for your seats?"
"B three, just up here, girls."
"This is row B, ladies."
-This is your row.
-Thank you very much.
"-Big fans, girls, yeah?"
-Yeah.
-Are you a big fan?
-Yeah.
Who's your favourite?
Darren?
"EarpIugs, ladies?"
There you go.
couple of sexy earpIugs for you.
"Because they're not great, these boys."
"They can't really sing, they can't really dance."
What's your favourite song?
"""What Makes You beautiful."""
I'll never see him again!
"You all right, kid?"
I guess so.
"Say, what's that?"
"Got decorated, huh?"
It's just a medal they gave me in school.
Lincoln medal.
"That's pretty good, huh?"
I guess it is kind of an honor.
Why do they call it a Lincoln medal?
You got to look like Abraham Lincoln?
"Oh, no."
"You see, it's for outstanding achievement."
Yeah?
"And, well, Lincoln was a great man."
"Oh, sure."
Lincoln was ok.
"But if they'd have put Napoleon on there, it would've been a real first-class medal."
Napoleon?
Yeah.
Dads said Napoleon got a swollen head.
That's what beat him down.
"So now he's going to pay off Napoleon, is he?"
"Smart guy, is he?"
Now he's gonna pay off Napoleon!
Maybe he won that medal instead of you.
"As a matter of fact, he did help me get it."
"Well, that's what he said."
"Well, you see, I almost flunked in math, and dads showed me a new way to-"
Can that Dads stuff!
- But I only said-
"- Cut it out, you hear me?"
Please.
Your turn.
- Tired?
- Not really.
Me neither.
These are nice.
- You want to watch some TV?
- Sure.
I have some old movies.
"It Happened One Night, Lawrence of Arabia, Now, Voyager?"
How about Lawrence of Arabia?
It's nice and long.
Okay.
Lawrence of Arabia it is.
Just stick it in.
Right.
- Is it over?
- Yeah.
Go to sleep.
Are you just looking or buying?
- I'm not sure yet.
"- So, it seems to be going well."
- Have you?
"- No, and it's made no difference."
- I give you both a lot of credit.
- Credit for what?
I was just telling Henry how sex isn't an issue for us.
"It's much less complicated this way, not to mention sanitary."
It feels so good to be writing again.
I have so many ideas for the new book!
It's coming so easily.
I have outlines for three chapters.
Barry Neufeld?
So what's wrong with him?
"Besides the fact he looks like Gumpy, and he irritates the shit out of you?"
"- Gumby, not Gumpy."
- Gumby.
Why should that matter?
"I'm no great prize, either."
Don't say that.
You are a terrific person and a great teacher.
"The truth is, I think I've reached the point."
- What point?
The point that you know you'll never get married.
Married?
What's marriage anyway?
Oh!
Come on.
"A ring, a contract, fighting and compromising."
"No, it can be more than that."
I'll tell you what I envy about people in love.
I'd love it if someone really knew me.
What I like.
What I'm afraid of.
What kind of toothpaste I use.
I think that would really be wonderful.
"Hey, sister-in-law, you having a good time?"
Yeah.
- Have you seen Claire?
- No.
- I can't find her anywhere.
- I'll go find her for you.
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.
I just invented him.
What are you?
A clerk?
- Keep silence!
"- Yes, sir."
"Well, I'm promised to study law."
"Very well, Mr. Dawlish."
"- Ready for inspection, sir."
- Thank you.
The usual beach combings.
It'll take hard work.
They haven't been sworn yet.
What does the surgeon say?
"Ah, Mr. Goss."
"Well, they'll do."
"They'll do very well, sir."
- Excuse me.
I appeal.
- What?
- I'm a gentleman.
- An impostor.
- I questioned him.
"Excuse me, sir."
- Mr. Scott-Padget?
- I must ask you not to turn your back.
"- I apologize, sir."
- My other duties...
"- Until dismissed, your duty is with me."
"Lads, don't think it's the end."
This ship has a fine crew.
Many were pressed like yourselves.
We have every hope of an exciting cruise and rich prizes.
-Want some brandy?
- Yeah.
-Who doesn't?
Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf-Astoria?
"Heh, okay."
It's on me.
You won't get off that cheap.
What are our chances of busting out of here?
We'll know in about 40 seconds.
Hold his leg up.
Just in case your kameraden are hard of hearing.
Thirty seconds.
Get him up.
"Stop shaking, Price."
There'll be no pardon from no governor.
"Funny, ain't it?"
In your own vaterland by your own soldaten.
This kid's got no sense of humor.
Twenty seconds.
Open the hatch.
"What's the matter with you, Security?"
You were always so calm.
Especially when you let Manfredi and Johnson go out there.
Eight seconds.
"Seven, six, five four, three two, one."
Go!
This is it.
"- Let's blow, Chauncey."
-Let's.
"All right, men, everybody back in their bunks like nothing happened."
What do you know?
The crud did it.
Okay.
I'm just gonna pack this up.
I'll see you there in a minute.
Wood:
"The owner seemed a bit punchy, but his ride was great..."
"A $45,000 2009 Grand Cherokee Hemi."
"I knew a lot about this jeep, and I had a feeling my knowledge was about to get me a big tip."
"Jeep really started, like, the luxury SUV."
"With these in America in '93, I think it was... great cars."
It's kind of strange 'cause the car has a lot of power for...
Geez.
Hello.
"You know, for what it is."
It's a strong car.
It just doesn't...
get the power down.
Ferrara:
"At around 11:00, I got a call from my next pick-up."
I hadn't made any money yet and hoped my next passenger would be more generous than captain climate control.
- Andrew?
- Andrew.
Adam.
Nice to see you.
"Adam, nice to meet you."
All right.
"I'm here to get you home safe, my friend."
[ Laughs ] Good.
Good.
After you.
Thank you very much.
Which way's your car?
My car is right over there.
You accuse me of stealing them!
?
I didn't say that!
"Do you mean me, then!"
?
"I didn't say that, either!"
"I'll fix you, if you call me a thief!"
"I won't let you off, either!"
What are you doing?
Beat you for calling us thieves!
Don't run!
Stop!
You again!
?
"Fate brings us together, from however far I bet your 109,200 miles are right here!"
Right beside your Nanking's 18 mounds!
Oh no-here comes Mr. Ugly!
A basket of grapes isn't worth this!
Two heads think better than one
Let's talk this thing over!
"Yes, we walk on two legs"
We can't let a quadruped best us!
The loser will lead the dog away
Tiger!
Snake!
Dragon!
Mantis!
Crane!
My crane will eat your mantis!
"If a man's unlucky, he'll see ghosts in the sun?"
Pick a little more!
Can I ask your name!
It's Dad's receipt books.
You found Dad's stinginess collection.
I thought Morn threw out that crap.
Aren't you starving?
Are you telling me he wrote down all his expenses?
It's from when he used to wake us up with a whistle.
"""Dad's inspection."""
Cheapskate.
"On July 12, 1980 you ate a Popsicle, Dorona-."
"Look. ""Popeye Popsicle for Dorona, 40 agorot."""
What's a Popeye Popsicle?
I'm glad you've calmed down.
You had me worried with your freak-out-.
What?
You look nice in those undies.
Surprising.
Did you think I sleep in a suit?
You have a cute ass.
- God help you with that sinful talk...
- Why sinful?
Maybe we don't have the same father?
"Who knows, maybe we have a different mother."
Maybe you came out of thin air like Jesus.
"But if I had to choose, I prefer you."
"You're sexier than him, too bad you're gay."
Look.
He stopped keeping track 6 months after I was born.
So what?
Why did he stop?
Did he stop spending?
Maybe he was fed up-
- Right-I was born and he got fed up-.
I'm going.
Dylan?
"Beka, tell me you are not onandromeda."
I am not onandromeda.
Except i am.
I'm looking for spare parts.
Am i missing anything?
We've been boarded.
Make your way to my quarters.
We'll take back the ship.
"So lock ourselves in and fly to where, exactly?"
"One step at a time, beka."
"Rhade, beka is on deck 41."
We're going to meet at my quarters.
"Beka's back on board, huh?"
"Well, not working out"
"As the greatest plan you ever devised, is it?"
"If you've got a better one, i'd like to hear it."
"See what i mean, rhade?"
Rhade?
They've kept us alive.
Merciful and incompetent.
Really?
Is now the time for insults?
I always wanted you two to bow down before me.
"Hey, guys, what's up?"
Take them away.
There's a class b asteroid
In the abbott belt.
It's hollow.
You don't say.
It is a tesseract generator.
Would you like some tea?
Thank you
"Oh, no thank you."
- Would you like some?
- No.
"Are you sure, it's very good!"
I said no.
Maybe some biscuits?
I baked them myself.
Gate away from me!
Ronon!
It's alright.
It's OK.
"They hate me, don't they father?"
No...
They just don't know you.
Was that really necessary?
"You can dress her up and teach her table manners, but it's not gonna change who she is."
"Teyla, this is Sheppard."
Come in.
"Go ahead, Colonel."
Is Ellia still in the cave?
Yes.
Has she been there the whole time?
"Yes, why?"
I just found another victim.
"Apparently, he's only been missing a couple of hours, which means she couldn't have done it."
Looks as though Zaddik may have been telling the truth after all.
We must defend ourselves!
Colonel Sheppard.
Is there any progress with this hunt?
We're working on it.
She might even die.
How is she?
She went on a hunger strike outside the King's chambers.
She's been out in the cold for four days and nights.
The wretched woman.
She's trying to kill herself.
The King is ignoring her.
Now that Jumong is dead the King doesn't need a hostage.
Why won't he let her go?
He still wants to win her heart.
Your Highness!
Your Highness!
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!
Your Highness...
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!
Your Highness...
Your Highness.
"Hurry up, take her to her chamber."
"Yes, sir."
"Your Highness, I'm here."
How do you feel?
You've gained consciousness but you'll die if you don't take this.
Please drink some.
I'm ready to die.
I have nothing to fear.
You're dismissed.
I have something to tell you.
I'm the assassin Prince Daeso sent to Jolbon.
I told Prince Daeso that I'd killed the Commander... but he's not dead.
Is Jumong really alive?
"It's like-  ""The Square Root Of Three""?"
"- No, no, I'm sorry-  ""A poem of love by Kumar Patel."""
- I need this.
"- Hey, let me read it."
"- No, no."
- Why?
- Because it's lame.
Then read it to me.
There's no way I'm letting you see me in that light.
Good luck with your calculus.
"Come on, don't be embarrassed."
"You know, a lot of girls find intelligence sexy."
"Look, I'm not even gonna be showing this to my professor, all right?"
That's why I'm so stressed out right now.
"Stressed out, huh?"
Come with me.
- ...going?
- Come on.
What?
You're smoking drugs in the library?
What if somebody catches us?
Don't worry.
It'll help you relax.
"Oh, boy."
It's illegal.
I want your fish right by me
That's how it has to be
Here.
--Copacetic if you let it so set up
And keep the downstream down and the upstream up
This is poison.
"My stoney, my baby"
But I wanted to check in first.
"- Well, I'm doing great."
Thanks for asking.
- Check in on Stefan.
"Oh, him?"
"Oh, he's..."
He's terrible.
What's the matter?
"He's just back to boring, strait-laced, off the junk."
You've successfully cured him of anything that was interesting about his personality.
- Don't forget who helped me.
- I hate myself.
"Hey, did Uncle John mention anything to you about my field trip with the teacher?"
"No, I've still been avoiding him."
Why?
What's he up to?
- I'd love it if you could find out for me.
- I gotta go.
I'm late.
Have fun with the Mystic queen.
I know I did.
[SCOFFS]
Elena called.
So these are the specs for the History Department's Founder's Day float.
We're gonna be re-creating the Battle of Willow Creek.
Tyler's been nominated to head up the design.
- By who?
- By me.
I've seen your sketches.
- I'm not really into the whole...
"- You just pick your team, be creative and..."
And don't screw up.
They were sent to the shooter.
We traced the I.P. address.
Comes straight from this office.
(sighs)
O-Only I couldn't have sent these.
See the date and the time?
I wasn't here;
I was with a client at a hotel on Kalakaua.
I can prove it.
"Okay, Abby, who else has got access to your computer?"
Just my assistant Andrew.
He's taking off.
Hey.
Hey!
(siren wailing nearby)
(truck horn blaring)
(tires screech)
You should've let me die.
"Andrew, why would you do this?"
"I'm in love with you, Abby."
I've always loved you.
I just wanted you to stop.
Unrequited love.
Second oldest motive there is.
(alarm system chimes)
(exhales)
"Hello, Sam."
"Geez, Joe."
When'd you get back?
"You know me, I come and go as I please."
"Family is safe and sound, fast asleep."
"Well, can I assume you didn't break into my home just to say hello?"
We need to talk to you.
Sit down.
- What's going on?
- Don't say anything.
- Just watch.
- (tender music plays)
Baby pictures of Luke?
More than baby pictures.
You're gonna watch Luke grow up to sappy music.
Why are you doing this?
To get all the crying out of your system so you don't melt down at the graduation.
It's like when you drink too much and your friends get you super-wasted so you never drink again for the rest of the week.
(voice breaking) It's the first time he saw snow.
"Oh, here, Dad."
Thank you.
(crying) His baby blanket?
!
Why?
!
(sobs)
"Hey, nice car, Grey Gardens!"
It was a gift from my son!
Ugh.
What the hell?
(sighs)
(tapping on glass)
(muffled) Rawrrr!
You call that a tiger?
R-a-a-a-awrrr!
_
And we're very proud of our state-of-the-art computer lab.
"It's so weird... every time I step into a middle school,"
- Can everybody just shut up?
!
- I hate it.
Sorry about that.
Anyway...
Hello.
Hello.
Is this Phil dumpster?
"What do you want, Gil?"
Got to be kidding me.
Hang on.
I need you to send a gift to mom for her birthday from the both of us.
"No, I did it last year."
"I know, and I need you to do it again."
"Look, I've got a conference call at 1:20."
"Then Luke's tutor comes to the house, 2:45 sales meeting, and I still got to get Alex to Judo."
And yet you somehow found time to bitch at me.
Wow!
You really can have it all.
Ugh.
"Honestly, just get her a stupid gift card, you big baby!"
You're back in second place with your favorite view.
Ugh.
Why does everything with him have be so dramatic?
Why are we stopping?
Hey.
Hey.
Oh.
Perfect.
"Okay, first you berate me on the phone, then you show up to my office and berate me in per..."
"Oh, w-what is this?"
I don't care for this.
- What am I missing?
"- Perspective, for one."
That's a loss and a win.
How is that the downfall of my gym?
You worried?
No.
[Chuckles] Come on.
"Alvey, you got to be a little concerned."
Not a bit.
And this isn't an interview.
"Well, I appreciate the apology, but it's not necessary."
"You know what, you haven't seen my gym, right?"
Let me give you the 10-cent tour.
"This way, the next time you butcher me, you know what the fuck you're talking about."
- Mind if I take some photos?
"- Whatever you need, Mario."
[Music playing]
[Indistinct chatter]
Hey.
Lisa's looking for you.
She's in her office.
All right.
I'll be right there.
What's up?
Shut the door.
I saw you training with Alvey today.
"Oh, man, I fucking sucked."
I was so nervous.
He was impressed.
He made it a point to tell me that.
- No shit.
- No shit.
- What do you need?
- Just general stuff.
- You guys go and be in love.
- See you back at the house.
What if you shoot the person who throws the pigeon in the air?
Would that count?
Sorry.
"No, I should have signaled or honked."
My fault.
"I guess it was inevitable, us running into each other."
- It's a very tiny community.
- I guess so.
- How's the diner?
- It's still there.
Yes.
I knew that.
"I'm able to empirically, with my eyes..."
"- Hey, Luke, do you think we could..."
- I got to get back.
Okay.
Right.
I'll get it.
"- Hi, Grandma."
"- Hello, Rory."
Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.
I'm thrilled to see you on no notice.
"So tell me, what's this about?"
You were so mysterious on the phone.
I wanted to talk to you about something in person.
"Well, come in."
It's an English tea service.
One of the advantages of our having an English maid.
Yeah.
"Yeah, I did."
"Yeah, it's kind of all been one long horror story."
What do you mean?
Nothing.
Sorry.
"So, what was this advice?"
I might need to plagiarize myself down the line.
You told me that I didn't have to go into the family business.
You said I should make my own choices.
"So you've managed to do your own thing, then, huh?"
"Yeah, for a while, yeah."
And I think I went to college because of you.
"But, you know, people grow up."
Yeah.
Responsibilities.
"But still, um... you took an interest in me when no one else did."
"That matters, so... thank you."
"Well, you know, the only thing that really matters is uh... that you're happy."
"Are you happy, Sam?"
"- (SIGHS) Well, got another one."
"- Oh, boy."
What's in the box?
(EX CLAIMING) What's in the box?
What's in the box?
What's in the box?
Right?
(LAUGHS)
Brad Pitt?
Se7 en?
Nothing?
This is not an internet cafe.
I must get some rest and relax.
Doctor's orders.
No turning back.
Are these all the patterns you have?
"Whatever the pattern, they all float the same."
But they aren't pretty.
Fun.
Yoon!
Hella entertaining.
"What's next, doc?"
I didn't bring a computer with me.
I'm sorry.
"The next time you call, I'll definitely do it for you."
Please give me a call.
Okay.
How do people just lie around and do nothing?
Doing nothing is totally useless.
"Dear Goddess Tubtim, even though I'm picky about my jobs lately,"
I still want some jobs to come in.
Holy shit!
I didn't even finish yet.
Je give it to me.
"Hello Yoon, please come in to get the brief."
Sure!
The photo looks too cheap.
"Wedding photos are supposed to look more fancy, right?"
"I want more classic, and hi class."
I'm not doing it.
Say what?
You get back from the beach and you're indie now?
Why now?
I wiIIjust come back.
Dont hang up.
Good morning!
Here are the papers and here are your90 Iakhs!
Come in!
"please, come in!"
Come in!
"please, come in!"
"Man, how did you know that I will.."
..definitely make a deal on 90 lakhs?
"Dhanraj, I know how much each man is worth!"
I know pressure points for everyone!
Take this.
You know there is a saying in our Gujrati.
Dont make a deal with a man to..
..whom you dont understand!
But I am making this deal because..
..I can get you guys!
Because its profitable for me!
Take this.
Just tell me one thing.
Does your boss want to start a price war?
"No, he is planning totally different!"
He wants to throw down those who are at the top!
Good day!
"And enjoy your self, please!"
The money has arrived!
The money has arrived!
Its tune is soothing!
Its tune is soothing!
The money has arrived!
Coming!
"Hi, sweetie."
"See, why did you just call me ""sweetie""?"
- We always call each other that.
- Why?
"All right, look, I wanna say something, okay?"
"We call each other ""sweetie"" all the time."
And we fall asleep on the phone after talking for hours.
I washed your hair for you after you had shoulder surgery and everything.
And it's like we're together.
- I know that I've been...
"- No, hold on a second."
Let me finish.
I think maybe this is my fault because maybe I wasn't clear about exactly what I want.
So let me...
Let me be clear.
I love hanging out.
But I'm so attracted to you.
I just...
I want both.
I don't know what happened or why we stopped.
I don't care.
Okay.
- What?
- Okay.
"No, I'm talking about really doing this."
Like a full-on relationship.
Right.
With me.
Yeah.
A bunch of gay people put you up to this?
Stop talking.
DEVON:
A truck will be coming by this afternoon.
If you're just going to give it away...
"If you'll excuse me, Mrs. Shrike."
I'm in a bit of a hurry.
I like to report a hit-and-run.
I'm still gonna need to record your statement.
"Later, right now I just want to..."
Just want to sleep.
Who are you?
You okay?
Don't I look okay?
If you were any thinner you wouldn't exist.
No!
Trevor?
You still got a half-hour.
I could fix you some eggs.
I'm tired.
But thanks.
"Let's go, monkeys."
"Watch your work, not your ass."
"Come on, guys."
Keep it moving.
"Yessuh, Mistah Tucker!"
Mutha-Fucker.
Why's this machine down?
Maintenance.
Takes seven minutes to power-up that mill.
"Where am I gonna make up that seven minutes, Miller?"
- From your paycheck?
"- Back off, Tucker."
You know it's against regulations.
"What are you thinking, Walter?"
"Hey, guys."
The footage from the abduction has been downloaded.
"Also, the police found a book on a bench by the museum..."
- ...with some kind of weird writing in it.
- They think it was his?
"Well, they don't know, but Agent Broyles is sending it over."
OLIVIA:
Have we ID'd the victim?
ASTRID:
"No, not yet."
OLIVIA:
"Wait a minute, Astrid."
Can you zoom it?
Now freeze it.
"Peter, that isn't him."
That's a different guy.
There's more than one Observer.
Stop.
Hold on.
What just happened right there?
Was he hit?
Who are these people?
- Please don't hurt me.
- Please don't hurt me.
- Why are you doing this?
- Why are you doing this?
- Please let me go.
- Please let me go.
- I promise I won't tell anyone.
- I promise I won't tell anyone.
- You don't have to do this to me.
"I know all about the new lag,the one who likes to blow things up."
Is that his voice on the tape?
"If you want to know what the song is, then you find out why I am in here all the time."
Deal.
The song?
It's a Korean lullaby.
The thing about land mines is...
You got to remember where you put 'em.
"Otherwise,you blow up your own men."
The lullaby was the enemy's way of communicating that information.
One word in each line indicated a different location.
We did the same thing.
Crosby and Sinatra.
"""Snow..."
Beard...
Grace.
"Snow... ""Beard..."
Grace.
Where are you putting them now?
"""Little brook..."
In the woods.
*****
There's more.
A second verse.
"""Among the pines you flow."
Pine street.It matches.
Broke the lock and put a new one on.
"Yeah,and the kicker is,it looks like he broke it from the inside."
"He broke out,not in?"
This is where he came back.
"Well,let's find out."
Looks like somebody was painting.
We got a problem.
Why didn't you just radio me?
I wanted to radio but...
Looks like they decided to join the hunt.
"If they find Ellia, they'll kill her."
"Sheppard, this is McKay."
"What is it, Rodney?"
The villagers are on the move and it doesn't look like they're gonna a picnic.
Are they heading for the caves?
"Not at the moment, no."
"Alright, get back there and sit tight."
"We're losing time, guys."
Ellia?
Ellia?
She's not here.
Good Lord!
What?
She took the retrovirus.
- You said it wasn't ready.
- It's not!
Not by a long shot.
What'll it do?
"To be honest, I have no idea."
"Colonel Sheppard, come in."
Go ahead.
We'vegotanotherproblem.
Ellia's gone and she's injected herself with the retrovirus.
Why would she do that?
She must have overheard us talking about it.
I told Zaddik it might be the key to making her human.
Please.
You've got to find her before the villagers do.
And to remember that it's never too late to recapture who you were.
Or to aim for who you want to be.
Take a seat.
Where have you been?
I was just out looking at the stars.
You were stargazing...
every night this week.
How about the truth now.
I've been sneaking out.
Obviously.
Why?
To try things.
Such as?
Um...
I've been testing myself.
Getting stronger and faster.
"I know I shouldn't let people see me, and that's why I do it at night."
I
- I don't know what to say.
I expected that it would take you longer to get comfortable living here before we were ready.
We?
"I have big plans for you, Jessi."
And I need you to be as strong and as smart as you can possibly be.
How do we start?
"Well, first thing's first."
You need to get some sleep.
We'll talk about it further in the morning.
Okay.
LISTEN
WHO IS THIS
Amanda.
What happened?
"I know you don't know much about time,"
But for us it's a big deal.
"But you don't have to worry about time, 'cause no matter what time it is,"
I'll be here to feed you.
- Ms. Levin?
"- Yes, this is Mrs. Levin."
Hi.
I'm Shawn Gilder.
I'm a teacher here in Arizona.
I'm calling to inquire about a former student of yours.
"His name is Mikey Trenton, and he's in the fourth grade."
Mikey Trenton?
I don't remember a Trenton.
Yeah.
"He had a different last name, but he won the spelling been last year."
"Oh, my God."
You must mean Michael Kelvin.
Why do you say that?
You haven't heard about the tragedy?
"No, I haven't."
"Oh, I'm sorry."
I don't know if I should say.
Please tell me.
"It was his whole family, and..."
What happened to his family?
They were murdered.
"We never found out how because the police are still looking for the killer, and--"
I'm going to the market.
You got any requests?
A six pack?
"Just kidding, Mom."
"- Good-bye, sweetie."
It's a...
It's the famous line from...
I'll be right back with your order.
"Belinda, I hope you don't mind, but I'm gonna head home."
- We can just hang out another time.
"- Oh, no, don't."
"I know this is weird for you but if you just help me out, we'll get out of here quickly."
- I don't think I can...
"- Christine, please."
Marly is just...
She's looking for an excuse to fire me.
"And I really need this job, so please, please help me out."
- Ugh.
"Okay, I'll help you out."
- Thank you.
Uh-oh.
Who let the hens out?
[WOMEN LAUGHING]
"Charles, honey, what are you doing here?"
"I have my book club meeting, remember?"
"Oh, don't worry, I'll clear out."
Let you ladies do your reading and drinking.
[LAUGHING]
"Thank you, darling."
"So, what did everybody think about the book?"
- Lindsay?
"- Oh, yeah."
It was amazing.
"- You didn't read it, did you?"
- I had a rough week.
Jackson was sick and Kelsey came home crying.
"There's another Kelsey in her class and now they call my daughter ""Big Kelsey."""
Beautifully put.
"So, given your dad's age, I'm guessing your condition isn't a new thing?"
- Where's your mother?
- She's dead.
"Right, sorry."
"So, is somebody else looking after you?"
Just Dad.
He's not doing a top job.
- Great.
- Oh.
"Nina, no."
We are not getting involved.
We can't let a teenage vampire
- loose on the street.
- Er...
I'm 46.
"- There you go, he's 46..."
Really?
"Not emotionally, he isn't."
"Like he said, he's still effectively being breast-fed."
"Well, if you're offering."
"Oh, can you not ask my girlfriend to suckle you, please?"
"Look, you're just gonna have to pull a sickie and take him back to the house."
- Why?
"- Look, this is Mitchell's territory."
He'll know what to do.
This is not our problem.
But it's only till his dad recovers and then we can leave them both to it.
All right?
- Oh!
"- Right, you're going home with George."
"- What, to your kennel?"
"Oh, that jail had a particular smell."
- Like lilacs dipped in urine.
- Nice.
- Yeah!
"- Oh, no."
This is the best day of my life.
Who knew you were the black sheep of the family?
- Can we talk?
- Sure.
- I'm proud.
- Shut up.
"- Give me a high-five, Mom."
- No!
God.
"- So, what's up?"
- I just wanted to give you a heads-up.
Holly's going to the board to try to overturn your decision
- not to counter on the vineyard.
- That woman is a nut job.
I'm backing her play.
You're what?
"I think the opportunity's right, the investment is right and I think it's what Dad wanted."
I'm voting with Holly.
- What happens now?
- We go downstairs.
Then what?
"I'm going to my office, check my e-mail."
Do whatever you want.
- About you and me.
- I just covered that.
"Office, e-mail..."
"I mean, if you don't think that this is going to work, then I understand."
- My mum.
"She can't keep a single secret, the pissed, old cow."
She's in SPAT with Suzie and all.
"To begin with, I feel terrible about it now, but I was like:"
"""Why shouldn't she kill herself if she wants to?"""
- She's got me.
"- But I didn't know that then, did I?"
- I know.
I made a complete ass of myself.
"- Yes, you did."
I enjoyed it.
"You know, I sort of tried to draw fire."
"Obviously, I thought the worse I looked, the better Marcus would look."
"In that case, Marcus looked fantastic."
Okay.
Can I come in?
Maybe.
- I'm a bit busy.
"- Oh, yeah?"
Doing what?
"Watching ""Countdown""."
Let me ask you something.
What would you rather do?
"Watch ""Countdown"" or have sex with me?"
Stuart's track record here.
Very good performance last week.
"He came in with a 44 and came out on Friday with a 72, which is the second..."
Every man is an island.
I stand by that.
I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it!
:
"My friend Carl, his brain!"
Behind you.
Is that Carl's Brain?
Over there?
On the expressway?
"Beware, for it will immediately seize you upon my, command, and your mind will be enslaved to forever..."
Polish the chrome at this wash -- car wash.
This is retarded.
"Oh, he called you retarded, Daddy."
Stop him at once.
From calling me retarded.
"Too late, he did it."
He got away.
"Go eat your brain now, Carl."
"Dinner time, isn't it?"
"Oh, look at that."
It's dinner time.
"Oh, no, you don't."
Where do you think you're going?
"Home, now get out of here."
We are closed.
We open at 10:00 tomorrow.
I think what Mac's trying to say... is that it's probably the greatest movie of all time.
That's 'cause it is.
Rocky IV is not the greatest movie of all time.
"Dee, what do you consider to be a good movie?"
"- I don't know, like, Million Dollar Baby..."
"- Oh, come on."
- Are you kidding me?
That is ridiculous.
- Come on.
Let's see what frightened you.
It's okay.
Come.
"Dr. Lemelle, allow me to introduce Miss Porter, our new patient."
Isabel is new to her medication and she had a bit of a fright watching you work.
- It was the noise.
- It was still alive.
"It's distasteful, yes, but it's the only way to procure a fresh specimen."
- Poor thing.
- Perhaps.
"But I cannot sally forth and saw at the skulls of dainty, melancholic humans for my research, can I?"
- No.
"- Come, Isabel."
Let's leave the good doctor to his work.
Here we are.
- Thank you.
- Safe and sound.
Do not wonder the halls in a place like this.
Yes?
- Yes.
"- Good night, Miss Porter."
Scream and I will slit your throat!
Please don't hurt me!
- Hurt?
"No, no."
I need you to help me.
I need to escape.
There's no leaving.
They will find me.
"The wolves, they will find me."
- Let me try to find Dr. Cairn for you.
- I have failed him!
[sighs]
But look at me now.
"Mom, lie down for a while."
The Sergeant will come back later.
I just remembered something.
"That's more like it, Mrs. Slocum."
I sent my black taffeta to the cleaners... and it's never gonna be back in time for that meeting at the women's club.
[sighs]
I'll be back.
"Really, Sergeant."
My mother's a wonderful woman.
She just suffers from overacting.
That's the understatement of the year.
"Oh, mercy."
You must be that detective.
"Say, I got a few ideas about that murder."
I'll bet you have.
[scoffs]
Well.
"Where's your mother, honey?"
"Mrs. Armstedder, take it easy."
She's really had a rough day.
"There you are, Lottie."
"Boy, do you look a mess."
"Well, come on, honey, refreshments."
We got a lot of talking to do.
Now.
Oh.
Move over.
Isn't this exciting?
Look at that.
"""Baby-sitter questioned in murder."""
Appreciate it.
"Ooh, it's cold."
You think you could just pick this shit up tomorrow?
- Ma'am.
"- Yes, ma'am."
"Oh, God."
"Fuck you, America."
You have 14 new voice memos.
"Oh, my God."
"Mike, some old golfer died."
Do I need to say something?
Next memo.
"Kent, I just got your document."
I have no idea what any of this means.
Next memo.
"Oh, okay, Kent."
"I just found the glossary, so ignore that last message."
Next memo.
"Ted, I've just read the glossory."
I have no idea of any of it means.
That's why I included the second glossory.
Next memo.
"Mike, is it pissing you off I'm leaving all these messages?"
Yes.
Next memo.
"Good, because it's pissing me off you're not answering any of these messages."
Next memo.
How do you leave a memo in your sleep?
- See you.
- Next memo.
"Mike, were you at work today?"
I don't remember seeing you.
"Uh, can we get a picture please?"
"Uh, sure."
Princess... picture pants here she loves taking photos.
It's a wedding gift.
Especially of hot guys.
"No, I'm just kidding."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I like it.
Mm-hmm.
Um... are they ready?
"Uh, I think so just give us two seconds."
I'll go get Drew.
Do one shirtless.
- Ok.
"Hey, we ready?"
No.
What do you mean no?
Well... we're waiting on Drew.
"Ah, so typical."
Drew left no explanation with anyone.
I guess he felt he didn't need to since he never actually asked Jill to marry him in the first place.
"But as difficult and embarrassing as the day was for Jill, deep down,"
I don't think she was surprised.
You can't push a guy into marriage like that and then expect a happy outcome.
Perhaps at one point Drew did love her.
He just forgot why.
What now?
Do you want to go get some pepperoni pizza?
"Honey, I think she needs something a little bit stiffer than a pizza."
"How about a double Jack on the rocks, huh?"
"Uh, excuse me, Jill, I..."
"- hey, can we get out of here?"
this party blows.
"- you, cindy wegman, are a bad, bad person."
- what?
i didn't do nothing.
"- i was supposed to teach you something about yourself, and i failed!"
"- [scoffs] hey, everybody fails, okay?"
that's life.
- you didn't learn poop from me!
you're hopeless!
"ohh. oh, god."
i need a bathroom.
- i didn't do nothing.
everybody fails.
"- mom, come on. wake up, mom."
- what?
"- mom, there's someone here -- - harley?"
look at you all grown up.
- mom?
- hi.
whoa.
[clears throat] whoa.
i need to slow my roll.
i was just dreaming up a storm last night.
- there's someone here from social services.
you got to talk to her and make her think you're a fit mother.
- a fit mother?
you don't think i'm a fit mother?
- well...
- come here.
"i know i might not always act right, but you know i'm always gonna be there for you no matter what, right?"
- right.
I couldn't never understand why you don't want to introduce us to each other.
Why won't you invite him to our house?
What does Garik have to do with it?
Don't interrupt me!
I'm fed up with it!
I got interested.
"I started gathering information about Garik, his family and work."
I found some data.
Come and look.
He's gone.
He died the next year after your graduation.
He died almost 30 years ago.
Your best friend died.
You could have invented something more convincing and not use such cruel lie.
I'm leaving.
I can't live like this any longer.
I'm so scared with you!
- Hello?
- Hello?
"Hi, old man!"
Garik!
Is that you?
It's me.
Who else could it be?
What's wrong with your voice?
- Aren't you dead?
- What?
Who is dead?
Are you drunk again?
You're dead.
Well...
You died and I went crazy.
He...
- ( jackhammer rattling )
- God damn.
How much longer?
( horns honking )
"Oh, fuck, according to Waze, an hour."
Fucking hour?
It's a quarter of a mile.
"Dude, welcome to Miami construction."
Should we call Wayne and tell him we're gonna be late?
No.
"Fuck, no."
Not a fucking chance.
"( sighs ) Well, what about Vern?"
"We should call him, right?"
Give him the good news?
"No, fuck that."
Let that motherfucker sweat it out
- like I'm fucking sweating it out.
- ( sighs )
- Fuck!
Let's go!
- ( horn honks )
"- Should we be doing this, Spence?"
- Doing what?
"This, fucking any of this, poking the bear."
"I mean, look at all the stress it's causing both of us."
- Are you stressed?
- Am I?
Are you fucking kidding me right now?
"My psoriasis, I can feel it fucking festering."
"It moves around the body, you know."
I'll help you.
Be careful.
Man attempting suicide is safe.
"Situation under control, cancel back up."
"You don't agree with what I did, right?"
Different principles.
Did I say anything?
You didn't say but I can tell.
Good to live.
Look at this family.
Filial child and a caring father.
Perfect!
You're sick!
Come through this.
It's too late when your loved ones are gone.
"Leave dad a message, press 1."
"Ask for money, press 2."
"Make an appointment, press 0."
"You go ahead, toilet break."
Michael?
You haven't called for a long time.
Where's dad?
He's not home.
Nothing then.
Michael.
Come home for dinner when you're free.
Have fun in the toilet.
I can't bear it anymore.
So sleepy.
Don't you see this city is beautiful?
"If you sleep, what can you see?"
"Bro, we need to get some sleep."
And we needed to find us some shelter!
This is my turn to tell a story.
"Hey, hey."
Shh!
The kindly innkeeper was warm and friendly.
She made me feel all bubbly inside.
My trusty sidekick here would love to freshen up.
- Sidekick?
- And I would love some waffles!
But we are equals.
"Oh, man."
Of course we are...
The noble donkey reassured his clearly inferior sidekick.
I'm getting a little tired of this...
"But before Puss could finish his thought, he decided to take a well-deserved tongue bath."
Wh... wh... wha... wha...
"Well, as long as I am here."
"But right then, danger came from behind."
"♪ Da-dum, da-dum ♪"
"♪ Da-dum, da-dum ♪"
And Puss was never seen again.
Ha ha.
The End.
No!
That's not how the story goes.
I was well aware of the approaching danger and went for my steel.
"Don't worry, little buddy."
I'm here to save you!
Ohh.
You're killing me.
It was Prince Charming!
"He was packing heat, and he wanted revenge!"
"- Well, I didn't get that much."
It all kind of went sideways after lunch.
Why?
What happened?
Francine knows about Lorna and Jim.
- How'd she find that out?
- She knew.
"She asked me about it, I lied, said it was a one night thing, but she knows."
I'm gonna have to let Jim know.
Shit!
Please don't put me in this.
I promised I wouldn't say anything.
This is gonna get ugly.
What did she say?
"Is she gonna freak on him, or what?"
She just seems really depressed.
I'll handle it.
"I'll look at these later, OK?"
Do me a favour.
Will you go downstairs and make me a cold glass of lemonade?
And ask Ronnie if he can make me a sandwich from the kitchen.
- I'm gonna make Mom a sandwich.
- All right.
Is she upstairs?
Are you feeling all right?
"Sure, everything's fine."
What's wrong with you?
Maybe you want to tell me something.
What are you doing with that?
"Don't do that, Frankie."
"Jesus, don't do that."
Are you fucking Lorna?
And you were right.
The strudel was excellent.
"Damn, we should have grabbed a couple of those crescents to go."
Oh well.
"Jacob, what happened to me after my father died?"
"Honestly, I don't know."
You hated me.
You left Berlin and I left the business.
And we never spoke again?
"Oh, I'd phone, you wouldn't take my calls."
I have no idea where you went or what you did.
"Started a new life, thought I could leave the past behind."
"So much for that, huh?"
"We don't just ring the doorbell, right?"
"Look, why don't you, uh, stay here."
I'm gonna go look around.
(speaking German)
Marta.
Don't move.
Hi.
Hi.
How did you?
Dog seems to know you.
Maybe.
Do I live here?
It doesn't look familiar.
"Huh, no labels."
"Well, someone's got expensive taste."
"Men's clothing, no women's."
I must not live here.
Gotta be something to identify whoever does.
You definitely know whoever lives here.
What?
No.
Don't ask that.
Please.
Henry.
Keeping our business alive...
..that will be... keeping us alive.
Thank you.
You are the best thing... that ever happened... ..in my life.
"Oh, Henry."
Edie.
"""The stream will cease to flow."

Henry chose hemlock.
He wanted to say a proper goodbye to Edie.
"Come on, Sid, we've got a competition to win for Edie."
The flower show!
I forgot all about that.
Lady Felicia?
"Yes, Mrs M?"
I was wondering if you might like one or two suggestions from me as to which flowers might catch Father Brown's eye?
I thought you wanted to win the trophy for yourself?
"Yes, well, I've had a change of heart."
Thank you.
The winner!
For Edie Lee.
The grower of the best flowers in the whole of the Cotswolds!
"And next Monday,"
I will be hiring Edie as the florist for the Websters' wedding.
but I was part of something.
I belonged.
I was treated like a grown-up.
Tell him 519.
Every day I was learning to score.
a dollar there.
I was living in a fantasy.
Did you have a good day at school?
My father was always pissed off.
he was pissed that my kid brother Michael wasinawheelchair.
He was pissed that there were seven of us living in such a tiny house.
Tell me what's this.
It's a letter from school.
It says you haven't been there in months.
In months!
You're a bum!
Want to grow up to be a bum?
he was mostly pissed because I hung around the cabstand.
He knew what went on there.
I didn't care.
The way I saw it everybodytakesabeatingsometime.
I can't make any more deliveries.
What?
You'll fuck everything up.
My dad says he'll kill me.
Look.
Come with me.
Is that him there?
No.
How about him?
No.
That's the guy Get him.
[Handcuffs].
What the hell happened?
-It wasn't Jacob's fault.
"He was trying to protect everybody, and lance was just ...."
"I got the boy off to the town hospital, he's gonna be fine."
You have any I'd where these boys might have gone?
I don't know.
The detectives out there want you both to come at the station.
Are you kidding me Walter?
"My kids are out there, scared and alone, I'm not going to any of your dam station."
"When they find them, they're bringing them in."
What's he doing?
-He's just staring at me.
Let's go.
[Hangs up the gas pipe]
"Hyder, hey, stop."
Stop.
"Hey, Hyder."
"Stop, where are Wes and Jacob?"
Uh?
Where are they?
The beach.
[Cicadas].
"Hey, how long?"
Has to be about at least 30mn before it gets back over here.
"Okay, we'll be back."
Let's go.
You remember when mom used to take us here to wait?
We start over in Galveston.
Just like she wanted.
It will be like ....
The Swiss family Wilson or something.
I'm here to give a contract to a gangster.
This is...
This is the picture of my son.
His life's in danger.
You've to save me.
I am so unfortunate and helpless.
I had to see this day.
I had to request a goon to save my son.
But I didn't come empty-handed.
That's not all.
This is just the advance.

But he'll pay you your price.

How will we communicate?
By farting?
"Planning needs money, and we don't have that much."
What can we do?
"No, that can't be."
"If we're going to do this, let's do it right."
I'll take care of the phone business.
Super!
The operation will take 60 minutes.
Good luck everyone.
Everything is okay.
We can start.
"Guys, it's your turn."
What's going on?
- Hello?
Kaan?
"- Where are you, man?"
- I got cut off and can't connect.
"- Great, and I can't get in."
What happened?
What do you mean by what happened?
Yours is here.
I am talking about Professor Candan.
She is here.
What's she up to?
What's she doing?

We're going to stay here and discuss this very quietly.

"If it isn't police or reporters, it's you."

"Miss Melissa Right to see you urgently, sir."
"So, we're off again."
"Show her in, Maria."
Show her right in.
"Bathing again, or is this a dry day?"
"Good morning, my dear."
How very nice to see you again.
My husband was afraid we'd seen the last of you.
I have a feeling you won't be needing your frogman's flippers today.
- You shouldn't have come here.
It's past 7:00.
"Thanks for trying, guys, but there's no point anymore."
"Sorry, Steven."

And then I'll die.

Mary left the work to me.
All of it.
"- What, she put that in her will?"
- Of course.
The funeral was four days ago.
We buried an empty coffin.
- Were you there?
- No.
"No, because you didn't know her."
Let alone spend 15 years of shared life with her.
"And yet here you are, demanding her work, demanding her papers, anything she left behind."
"""Come on, hand it over!"""
As if it's your right!
It isn't!
Is that clear?

"Miss Cramer, we've clearly got off on the wrong foot here."
"Poodle or no, all we wanted was a chat."
Maybe we could have one over a cup of tea.

We gotta trust him on this.
"Kaman, why are you doing this?"
We never did anything to you.
You kept Tracy away from me.
"Look what you've done, what you're about to do now."
I wasn't always like this.
"People don't change, Kaman."
No.
This is all your fault.
"Baby, you can't keep blaming the world for what happened to you."

"Baby, look at me."
Look at me.

I'm happy with you.
It's important for me to make his heart remember what his mind forgot.
But what matters the most to me is if he's safe.
Don't!
"Go ahead, Migs."
Take care.
It's already morning.
"Sorry, I got lost."
I even prepared food for you.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't understand what happened.
What?
You went to Bela?
.
Go ahead and explain your lies.
I'll make believe that nothing happened between the two of you.
I'd still listen!
Are we going to fight again?
.
"What, do you want me to be pleased?"
.
Don't I have the right to ask where you've been?
That Bela is really unbelievable.
"Because if I am the mistress, I would think of the wife waiting for you."
There.
Answer it!
And I want you to answer it in front of me.
Here!
Are you happy now?
.
Didn't you tell me that Bela is kind?
Maybe she's using her kindness to steal you from me.
- It looks so good on you.
I've dreamed about this for so long.
- Do you wanna fire it up?
- I can't.
Blair and I have a meeting at Rouge Tomate.
That's cryptic.

So I need to just stop moving and contemplate the failure of my life.
"When you're ready to start moving, you know I'll be here."
"Well, she's usually right."
She's been right about everyone else.
I lived a whole life with a woman I didn't even really like.
We traveled all over the world together.
And Ellen and I never even left the grounds.
"Well, actually I took you to the IMAX that one time."
"Yeah, but I wanted to take her to the Mayan ruins in Guatemala."
She really wanted to see those.

He got the license for this place.

- A week ago.
My God.
[Crying]
"Claire, you were told."
You just don't remember.
- Pardon?
- You were told about it.
You just don't remember us telling you.
I wouldn't remember?
I must have been -
And we had a memorial for him here as well.
- When?
"- Uh, last week."
- Was I there?
Who the fuck asked ya anything?
I didn't even ask ya anything.
At least wait to hear what I'm going to say.
"All right, what?"
"Ok, what."
She won't go out with Italians alone.
She's prejudiced against Italians.
You fucking believe that?
In this day and age?
What the fuck is this world coming to?
I can't believe this.
"A Jew broad, prejudiced against Italians."
"Anyway, she won't go out with me alone without her girlfriend."
So you come along for her friend.
See?
I knew it. I knew it.
What the fuck is wrong with that?
-When is this?
-Tomorrow night.
"I can't tomorrow night, I gotta meet Tuddy."
You could meet Tuddy.
You could fuckin' come early and then still go.
-Why do you always do this?
-Don't give me that shit.
What did I ask you for?
A favor.
I do a lot of fucking favors for you.
I'm trying to bang this fuckin' broad.
You wanna help me out?
I don't understand you.
She's fuckin' beautiful!
Her fuckin' family they live in the Five Towns.
"Shh, shh, shh, shh."
[Cat purrs]
"Oh, you seem to have the touch."
[Cat yowls] Ow!
Majique!
I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?
"Yeah, it's an occupational hazard."
I'm sure she didn't mean it.
"She's a good kitty, aren't you, Majique?"
[Purrs]
[Trunk slams] Hey.
Where's the body?
"First floor, room at the back."
- It's a little messy.
"- Well, what do you we know?"
"Uh, male, mid-40s."
Looks like somebody took a weed wacker to this throat.
Checked in three weeks ago under the name Nathaniel Adams.
"Clerk says he kept to himself, paid his rent, listed his home as New York City."
There was no sign of forced entry.
Maid discovered the body about an hour ago.
You weren't kidding about the weed wacker.
Looks more like a hatchet.
Except his head's still here.
- Who rolled the body?
- Nobody.
That's the way the maid said she found him.
"Well, this body's been rolled."
The pattern on the carpet matches the blood on his shirt.
That could have been the killer.
"There's no wallet, nothing in his pockets."
Good idea.
"May we search your room, sir?"
But of course.
I trust my map to the street you asked for was satisfactory?
It was.
Thank you.
- Did I get any messages?
"- Oh, yes."
A telephone message.
Alex Bohemia.
Did he leave a number?
Thank you.
You heard that woman.
This Suverov must have been looking for me.
"A stranger with your exact face... and according to the passport, your exact birth date... comes here and asks for directions to the very street where you live."
"A mystery, yes?"
An airline ticket from Nice to New York... and a New York driver's license.
Some U.S. cash.
He was born five minutes after you.
I kept both of you for three months.
But I was sick.
I couldn't nurse.
There wasn't even enough for one of you.
I needed the money.
I had to do It.
Tell me now.
Why did you choose me?
I didn't!
I didn't have the courage.
Somebody else did it for me.
- Somebody else?
- A lawyer from Paris.
- Hey!
You don't show the finger to the Boss.
Aren't you ashamed?
You thrashed Bajrang's men in Rajanwadi.
When someone's fit for a beating he's bound to get it.
But where's Bajrang?
He's been missing since you thrashed him.
No matter where the rat hides... you're going to blame me for it.
Boss.
You're acting too smart because Bajrang is still missing.
What will you do if you find him?
I will lock you up...
lock you up for assaulting him.
There's your man.
All the pain you took delivered him.
Now you beat him up along with me.
Now you'll be arrested too.
But... proof?
C!
C!
TV!
CCTV!
CC...
Inspector.
It's all about perspective.
Two strands of hair in a glass of milk seems gross... but on a bald head it seems too less.
From my perspective... the Boss did justice to the farmers.
Because...
The Boss is always right.
- Say it louder.
- Hail Goddess!
- Boss...
For me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
I see skies of blue
And clouds of white
The bright blessed day
The dark sacred night
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Yes
I think to myself
What a wonderful
"Yes, dude!"
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
What are you doing?
"I'm taking the most incredible dump of all time, man."
You couldn't wait till I got out of the shower?
May I remind you that we both just ate 30 burgers... and four large orders of fries?
"Don't worry, in a little bit, I'm sure it'll hit you too."
It may be.
But I'm gonna wait till you get out of the shower.
"Well, don't wait too long."
We've got to leave for the airport in an hour.
"Ooh, that burns."
- An hour?
"- Hey, and, Roldy?"
Yeah?
Nice pubes.
Ooh wee
Ooh wee
When I step into the party all the ladies wanna know
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
You don't mind do you?
-Recording your doing.
-Turn it off...now.
"If she doesn't want, she doesn't want."
Why?
nasty things this morning?
you know where they have the drugs?
How should I know?
Ask Jack.
Drugs?
"Don't be impatient, be cool."
"Brian was right, your roof is perfect."
This fucking city is really something.
What have you done to yourself now.
She can't hide it.
A chicken is a chicken.
Come on Jimmy.
You're both so beautiful and you look alike.
Be nice.
I'm not a chicken.
-Ouch!
-I'm sorry Jimmy!
I didn't know your scalp was so sensitive.
"Now don't get anything dirty, and tape the tags on the inside"
It's not necessary to cut them.
Where's the cocaine?
Dwayne?
"Would you fix us a few lines, darling?"
"Here, I've got some blow too, baby."
I'd like to ask you a few questions over your childhood.
"Come here, legs."
You don't want to overfeed a puppy.
- Oh.
"-Here you are, sweetheart."
- There you go.
Have a little bit of that.
"-Oh, isn't that sweet?"
- Yes.
-Aw.
Aw...
"Listen, does Ralph know about this yet?"
"Oh, no."
I haven't told him yet.
"Oh, you gonna tell him tonight?"
No.
I think I'll wait till tomorrow morning.
"'Cause, see, the man at the..."
down at the pound
-told me the dog's gonna need shots.
-Uh-huh.
"And Mrs. Manicotti's going to the vet's tonight to take her dog, so she said she'd take him along with hers."
Yeah.
"Well, once Ralph sees that sweet little face,"
-he's gonna love him.
-I hope so.
"Say, Trix, how come you never got a dog?"
On account of Ed.
"Oh, he loves dogs, but for the first few minutes Ed's around a dog, he-he itches and wheezes and sneezes."
"Ooh, it's somethin' terrible."
It's an allergy he's got to anything with fur on it.
"Oh, gee, that's too bad."
"Hey, you want me to drop the dog off at Mrs. Manicotti's for you?"
"Oh, Trix, that would be wonderful."
"Oh, fun."
Unless you don't want me to go.
Are you asking my permission?
"No,"
- you-you just seem like you...
"- No, no."
Go.
Have fun.
Enjoy yourself.
Okay.
Good.
- Good.
- Good.
"Look, take a break from work later, come visit me."
You gotta eat.
Maybe I will.
What the hell are you doing here?
"Dad, Scott brought these sandwiches over as a little peace offering."
"You know, for screwing up your deal."
Wasn't that nice?
"Well, let's see..."
Sandwiches... millions of dollars.
"Sandwiches, millions of dollars..."
He also brought pickles.
"Our biggest client just fired us because that deal fell through, thanks to this idiot."
"Hey, you know, there's no need for name calling."
"This is my place of business, pal."
I can call you Roberta if I want to.
- What the hell is that?
- My cell phone.
Listen to that.
Even his phone ring pisses me off.
I've done nothing wrong!

"I'm telling you, this son of a bitch killed her, this Mike."
"I begged her to tell me, but she refused."
His last name's not in the book.
This is gonna be very helpful.
So it's not a suicide.
This girl was murdered.
-You read how she was gonna quit drugs?
-Thank you for giving us the diary.
-You have leads?
"-Yeah, we're working on things."
You find this Mike.
He murdered my little girl.
"-You wanted to see me, sir?"
-Yeah.
"I want you to go over to Health Services and take a drug test, officer."
-A drug test?
What for?
WALLENBECK:
For cause.
Lieutenant brought facts to my attention that warrant it.
-l don't get this.
-You have a problem?
"No, sir, absolutely not."
I got nothing to hide.
I would like to know who's spreading rumors about me.
-No one's spreading rumors.
-Health Services expects you.
"-lf you got nothing to hide, not to worry."
"-Yes, sir."
You know where you're going?
Lefrak City?
"Yeah, I know where l'm going."
"Yes, sir."
He's been here for like 20 minutes.
"Oh, god, do they suck ass?"
And you're already dressed.
And what they're gonna do is they're
"Gonna bring you out through this side,"
And we're gonna put on your shoes.
Great.
"I'm gonna shoot with this guy, who's"
Half an inch taller than Mike in the 10-year-old fucking mask?
That's brilliant.
Who's fucking idea was that?
"Oh, that looks really great."
Motherfuckers.
INTERVIEWER:
What's that?
"They got the fucking 10-year-old mask on a 6'2"" guy."
MAN:
It doesn't look anything like-- we have a stunt man.
Somebody could have asked.
Anybody could have asked.
Somebody could have asked.
I had no idea they were shooting with it.
I'm sure--
I put together pieces of this makeup for a stunt man.
They don't care.
"No, they just don't fucking care."
They could do the rest of the movie with a 10-year-old
"Mask and 6'2"" guy."
Right?
Why not?
They just don't care.
"I'm doing this for all of us, mom."
Hi!
"No, thanks."
Are you also the pride of yourparents?
"Just like me, you're not sure."
"My fatherwas a soldier, I always wanted to be like him."
He used to say:
"""I am so proud of you, son""."
Attention!
"Combat boots on, guns ready, attack!"
One afterthe other...
They all die...
Dad would be so proud of me.
At ease!
"At ease, huh?"
Dad is dead.
My condolences.
We owe our lives to dad.
I owe everything to him.
"Soldiers are immortal, nations are indivisible."
"You'll fucking serve the army too, you pussy boy Can!"
Pussy boy!
We should leave now.
These hands were so tiny.
Size of a cat's paw.
They said you wouldn't live.
So tiny.
Now look at these...
Why don't you join a support group forfallen officers' families?
You're always at home.
It's not that.
It's the seaside I miss.
Saddle up.
What'd you do with my trailer?
- I parked it at your sponsor's tent.
- What?
Gotta make your personal appearance.
No.
No!
"No, no, no, no!"
"Yes, yes, yes!"
Lightning McQueen here.
"And I use Rust-eze Medicated Bumper Ointment, new rear end formula!"
Nothing soothes a rusty bumper like Rust-eze.
Wow!
Look at that shine!
Use Rust-eze and you too can look like me!
Ka-chow!
I met this car from Swampscott.
He was so rusty he didn't even cast a shadow.
You could see his dirty undercarriage.
I hate rusty cars.
This is not good for my image.
They did give you your big break.
"Besides, it's in your contract."
"Oh, will you stop, please?"
Just go get hooked up.

It's my fault!
If only I knew you carried so many rusted tins
I'll kill you fast!
"Now you're prepared, it'd be a bit harder"
"You're so smart, you can learn from me... in such a short time"
Now it's my turn!
Finished?
Killed?
That's what you taught me
Act like a Man
Fan San is killed suddenly
Who possibly can kill him?
"Dad, could it be a hero... who wants to deliver justice for us all?"
Hero?
I smell trouble!
That's right.
Now that someone is killed
Don't know how he will torture us again
"Gao, running around again?"
Where've you been?
I went to pee!
Pee again!
You pee all day long
Kidney failure?
How do you know?
How dare you!
T easing me!
"No, I'm not"
"Y es, you are!"
"You are, too"
Get a room!
I know you and I are history.
I just hope that we can reconnect on some level.
Maybe even be friends.
Yes!

I still don't get it.

Nice to meet you.
What's your name?
Liam.
I went on X Factor when I was 1 4 the first time.
It's bad news.
Simon sent me home because I was too young.
Why are you here today?
I'm here to be the best artist I can be.
he first time  saw the One Direction boys was when they auditioned as solo artists for he X Factor.
"I don't know if any of you have seen my first audition, but it was horrendous."
I hope it doesn't make any part of this movie.
just murdered it.
I'd Iike to make a personal apology to plain White T's.
hello.
So tell me a bit about you.
-I work in a bakery.
-And was asking stupid questions about what pies are popular.
You see these people  that audition for the show and they come from  the same sort of background as you.
"They just come from normal, working-cIass families."
-What's your name?
-My name's Zayn.
You know why?
"Because it's a stupid decision and you're not stupid, Paige."
- You were saving that money to go to Europe.
- It's going to better use there.
What use?
Do you know what they're using that money for?
"They're feeding refugees, building houses."
You guys don't help anyone!
We help you.
"W-We help you, and we helped you save that money."
Please do not roll your eyes at me.
You can show me some respect.
"- Paige, you started lying to us."
- I didn't lie.
"- Well, you certainly don't seem to know the difference."
- Do you?
- Lie...
Lying...
- Stop!
What are you doing?
You go behind our backs.
Why?
Does this book tell you to do that?
- Philip.
- Does it?
"You respect Jesus, but not us?"
[Door Opens]
[Door Closes]
Emergency signal from Fred.
What happened last night...
"You didn't have a choice, Philip."
This is war.
"Apology, Senator!"
"-Michael, excuse me."
"-Hello, darling."
The children are outside.
We're going.
What do you mean?
We're leaving tomorrow.
Rocco?
"I'll be in my room, Mike."
"Michael, I'm not going back to Nevada."
I brought the children to say goodbye to you.
I'm very happy for you.
I always knew you were too smart to let any of them beat you.
-Why don't you sit down?
"-No, I'm not going to stay long."
There are some things I'd like to talk to you about.
"Things that have been on my mind, changes I want to make."
"I think it's too late for changes, Michael."
-I wasn't going to say anything...
"-What do you mean, ""too late""?"
What really happened with Pentangeli?
-His brother came and helped him.
-I didn't even know he had a brother.
Where is he now?
"He's on a plane, back to Sicily."
All he had to do was show his face.
"It was between the brothers, Kay."
I had nothing to do with it.
I don't want you going!
"Not you, not the kids."
No.
You're my wife and my children.
You're the best we've got.
Am I really?
"It's more than psychiatry, and you know that, Tom."
"Some of their problems come down to faith their vocation, the meaning of their lives, and I can't cut it anymore."
I need out.
I'm unfit.
"Think I've lost my faith, Tom."
Hello?
"Yes, this is Mrs. MacNeil."
"Operator, you have got to be kidding!"
I have been on this line for 20 minutes!
Jesus Christ.
Can you believe this?
He doesn't even call his daughter on her birthday.
-Maybe the circuit is busy.
"-Oh, circuits, my ass!"
He doesn't give a shit.
-Why don't you let me--?
"-No, I've got it, Sharon."
It's all right.
Yes.
"No, operator, don't tell me there's no answer."
It's the Hotel Excelsior in Rome.
"Would you try it again, please, and let it ring?"
Hello?
Yes.
"No, operator, I've given you the number four times."
"Do you take an illiteracy test to get that job, for Christ's sakes?"
"Don't tell me to be calm, goddamn it!"
Yeah?
You're kidding me.
Okay.
I talked with Eva.
- You saw her?
She asked me to tell you that you were not responsible.
She would have broken down anyway.
She hated being a prostitute.
even a medical one.
You were just a catalyzer.
It's not your fault.
You're lying.
- Excuse me?
She would never have said that.
It's not true.
Globale told you to calm me down.
You're totally paranoiac.
I must find her.
Where is she?
Why do you need to know?
You know what will happen if you go outside.
Yes.
I won't be a B8 anymore.
I won't be handicapped and Globale will lose its contract.
They pay you.
So you have no interest in my going outside.
Look.
We all want you to get better.
to go outside.
But gradually.
I want to find her!
Remember two days ago?
You almost died.
Was it fun?
You want to try it again?
She was first in the room.
"I followed immediately after, sir."
Who's Miss Kelly?
"She works for Mr. Sabourin, sir."
Yeah?
And where should she be found?
"She's in his mother's room, sir."
You mean his mother lives here with him?
"Just since she came from Europe, yes, sir."
Let's look over the rest of the room.
Show me his personal things.
"Yes, sir."
"This way, sir."
It couldn't have been robbery.
"Yeah, if it was they overlooked a lot of cash and jewelry in these boxes."
"Diamond cufflinks, diamond rings, women's jewelry."
"Look at this, gold handcuffs."
Must be a dozen of them in here.
"Yeah, they're all over town."
He liked to think his women were his slaves.
Show me his mother's room.
"Yes, sir."
"This way, sir."
I'm sorry to break in.
We're police.
I'm her doctor.
You can't disturb her now.
He can ask me anything he wants.
"I'm sorry I have to do this, mam."
But do you know anything about this?
No.
I know nothing about who killed my son.
That bitch is trying to take money out of my fist.
That's it!
Out.
Get out!
Wait.
Darlene's busting you for child's support?
She's trying to tell me this Chinese-eyed motheftucker is my kid.
- Angel:
That's bullshit!
"- Un plato, and that's it."
"Shitty day, man."
How is your kid in Santo Domingo doing?
"What, Junior?"
My real kid?
"Good, man."
I can't wait.
"Save my money, soon as I get my 60 Gs, getting the fuck outta here."
"Go back to the D.R., live with him and Carmen."
I'm gonna open me a bike shop.
"Stay with my tío in Baitoa, just till I get hooked up."
"He got a farm, and when you're done working all day, you go lay on this hammock, next to the pond."
"You just lay there, bro'."
You let the breeze hit your face.
"You're chillin' with your boxers off, and the wind kissing your balls..."
Maggie:
Darlene is only asking for 600 a month.
Angel:
Guess how much she's getting?
Zero dollars.
"The thing of it is, that bitch rats me out,"
I'm as good as back in lockup.
That's why I don't trust nobody.
No.
Because I've heard it all before.
"No, I can't do this any more, Richard."
"Just leave me alone, OK?"
- Sorry.
- Don't be.
"Well, other people's rows."
"Oh, they're great, they're very entertaining."
Especially ones where they're shouting in the street.
"Well, we're done with the shouting."
- Is that why you're here?
- Yeah.
I left him.
- Poor guy.
- He messed up.
- Stupid guy.
"- I like to think I'm the easy-going type but, well, there are some things that can never be forgiven."
Tell me about it.
"My name's John, by the way."
I'm Rose.
"Take her all my money, tell her buy some pretty clothes."
That's a song.
Don't Forget to Give My Love To Rose.
Be nice if somebody would.
Would you like another drink?
"- So, where are you heading?"
- Patagonia.
- Travelling light.
- Mm-hm.
"Well, you don't need much stuff out there, do you, so..."
Just a change of clothes and a bottle of whisky.
"- I don't have any whisky, actually."
- Thanks.
- Be right back.
"Uh, Ms. McCabe, I have to go."
Thank you for your time.
[Gasps]
"Damn it, Alexis."
You're just like your old man.
You can't leave things alone.
Are you going to kill me?
What?
Why would you say that?
"Oh, I don't know."
Maybe because you're connected to my dad's missing time and now you're hiding in the back of my rental car.
"Alexis, I would never hurt you."
This isn't what you think.
"What the hell is your game, Hayley?"
"Believe me, you don't want to know."
Neither does your father.
Why not?
It's complicated.
Jordan Keegan?
We need to talk.
About what?
"Well, your name came up in a homicide."
This is the murder weapon.
It's a prop from a movie that you wrote.
So?
"So, did you happen to keep one as a souvenir?"
Perhaps two?
"One for yourself, one for your partner out in Los Angeles?"
What are you guys talking about?
"We're talking about Pat Crews, your old writing teacher."
"Hey, put that on the wall."
"If I can't have my lab, no one's having her."
"Now, don't lose this."
"Fuck you, Akan."
And don't change your channel.
We're coming right over.
"All right, I counted six vehicles."
That's at least 35 men.
We've gotta cut them down to half that before they enter the hotel to give us a fighting chance to get out alive.
"Also, there's a certain stigma attached to blokes who like musicals."
I just wanna get it out there right now that I'm straight as an arrow.
(VEHICLES APPROACHING) Got it?
Here they come.
Wait for it.
Wait for it.
(GUN COCKS)
Now.
(GUNSHOT)
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)
"Hey, cover me."
(PUNK MUSIC PLAYING)
(LAUGHING)
"Fuck, they're in the hotel."
We don't need the sniper anymore either.
Go inside.
See the colonel.
"Over here, laddie."
Arm yourself to the teeth.
Don't touch that.
Imogene's mine.
That's what my father used to say.
"""A grenade a day keeps the enemy at bay."""
Where's his mom?
- What type of mask?
"- Uh, round, like a baby."
Okay.
What do you see next?
[Laughter]
Fire.
"They were grilling lamb, and, uh, people were cheering."
[Rossi] All right.
It was a Greek restaurant.
"Baby, me and gyros?"
"- No, thanks."
- What?
- I'm gonna go check out this Mexican food.
"- Oh, baby, no."
"Baby, I'll be right back."
- All right.
- Stay there.
- I'm gonna come and get you.
- All right.
"[Rossi] Now, do you remember anyone in the crowd, anyone that didn't fit in?"
[Kiersten] No.
"But to be honest, I was already looking at the menu."
"All right, that's good."
"Now, don't look up from the menu."
Just listen to me.
"Now, when you love someone and they step away, there's an instinctive response to glance up to make sure that they're still there."
"Now, you did that last night, even if you don't remember."
Okay.
You're getting ready to place an order.
I already know what I'm getting.
I'm getting the gyros.
Worthless scrolls.
Where's the treasure?
I think you're looking at it.
That's right.
Solon himself said the Treasure of Atlantis has the power to command men's minds.
"Of course, books."
No.
It can't be true.
The Treasure of Atlantis... is knowledge.
There has to be more.
No!
You're destroying the scrolls!
Get away you stupid old fool.
I want treasure.
We gotta go.
But all this knowledge.
We can't let it be destroyed.
"Kelly, come on!"
"Come on, Kelly!"
Forget that.
"Well, that's our only way out."
Maybe we can tap into a little geothermal power of our own.
Geothermal power?
Professor.
Yes?
Stuff your jacket into one of those pipes.
Put a rock on top of it.
"Kelly, stand by the Torch."
"Well, whatever you've got in mind, MacGyver, hurry."
"Stand back, professor."
"All right, Kelly, hit it."
"Shut it off, Kelly."
"Do you want to know what I'm feeling, George?"
Mm-hm.
Hungry.
Adam?
"Do you want to go in and spend some time with your dad, and say goodbye to him?"
I don't have a good feeling about this.
Someone's just died.
You're not supposed to.
Adam hasn't just lost his dad.
He's lost his food supply.
He's going to have to feed again soon.
"Oh, my God."
- Where is he?
- Out.
"Oh, no."
Peaches)
You were a teenage boy once.
You know what they do.
"- Yeah, wank at any opportunity."
"- Well, that's helpful."
"Well, no, there's other stuff, but none of it really registers."
"# Well, there goes a girl and a half"
#She's got me going up and down
#She's got me going up and down... #
Dollar!
#...
Walking on the beaches Looking at the peaches
"# Well, I got the notion, girl"
# That you got some suntan lotion in that bottle of yours
"#Spread it all over my peeling skin, baby"
# That feels real good
#All this skirt lapping up the sun
- It's all that matters.
- It's never all.
It can exist in a happy ship.
"The ideal is always possible, sir."
If the men cooperate.
I'm sure they will.
I'll give you a toast!
To Defiant.
An efficient and happy ship.
An efficient ship.
And death to the French.
Depends on your gun drill.
"Mr. D'Arblay, get them into position!"
Jumping about like jackrabbits!
Fire!
Get back!
"- Oh, sir, I never meant to..."
- Sergeant!
Put this man under arrest.
For making to strike an officer.
You'll be flogged for this.
Six dozen lashes.
"Wheatley, you're under arrest."
- You made to strike an officer?
"- No, sir."
I wouldn't have.
- I've learned that much.
- But you did put up your fists?
"Well, answer me!"
"An impulse, instantly regretted."
- What was that?
"- An impulse, sir."
This is good.
This is really good.
My mother made food like this.
"Oh, thank you, Fern."
How's Walter?
He had his gallbladder taken out yesterday.
Good for him.
I'll give you boys 100% cooperation.
Me and my two deputies...
We'll take turns watching the place around the clock.
"So you boys can just take it easy, relax, drink beer, chase chicks, whatever you want."
We'll help.
Hmm?
We'll help you.
Suit yourself.
"Oh, another thing."
Old man Malcolm?
I guarantee he don't know jack shit about this stuff with his nephew.
You talk to him?
Not yet.
I just know it.
There aren't any telephone lines out to that old place.
He's like a hermit.
Hardly steps foot off his property.
We ought to talk to him.
That may be the case...
DALE:
"Charlie, get on in here."
Charlie's my deputy.
Retired police officer.
"Morning, guys."
This is Dud Cole.
Sounds like a real mystery.
Does it?
"Anyway, in the end he finds this very thin string that links everything."
I think that might be hard to get across.
People only believe in things that are very sound.
"But that string, even if he finds it, well, it's something like a soul."
There is nothing bodily.
"It's very, very light."
Damn it.
Not interesting?
It's interesting.
I don't quite get it.
But you have a way with words.
I like people who are eloquent.
I don't trust anyone who can't logically explain himself.
Really?
- What the hell?
- So adorable.
- What's his name?
- Dori.
"You're Dori, huh?"
You're so cute.
- How old is he?
- He's eight months now.
"You're eight, are you?"
"- Sorry, but we got to go."
"- No, I'm sorry."
"Bye, Dori."
Scared?
"Yeah, I've been bitten once, and never been near a dog since."
What's there to be afraid of?
He's so lovely.
Bridget!
"3 years ago, my heart was broken by you."
"After 3 years, my body and soul are in your hands again."
You can do whatever you like.
May your body rot and your soul burn in hellfire!
"Doesn't matter, I'll die anyway."
But this is the best way to go.
I'll die for my country and all mankind.
What a hero!
Pity no one knows about this.
"You know, I know, God knows and the Devil knows."
The man downstairs knows too!
"Unlike you, everybody knows you're a real whore!"
You think you're the greatest hero on Earth?
I am woman too!
"I know you are woman, a bad woman too!"
I said I am woman!
"You're not just bad, but wicked too!"
Listen:
I am woman.
You...!
What did you say?
"I am woman, answer me!"
I am woman too!
"18 years old girl, like a rose."
"Boy at 18, nothing to boast;"
"Woman at 40, beauty most,"
"Man at 40, what a ghost."
"Woman at 80, sparkles and glows,"
"Man at 80, coffin soon to close."
What's your rank?
"Supermac 99, and yours?"
Got a head start out of the territory.
I guess he knew you were coming.
[YATES GRUNTlNG ]
"I'm gonna find him, wherever he is."
I think you'll find this room delightful.
"It has a lovely view down Main Street, just as you requested."
I call it the presidential suite.
The very best appointments.
I'm expecting new linens from the capital soon.
ELl JOE:
"Oh, this is gonna do just fine."
"Well, you enjoy your stay, now."
ELl JOE:
Mm.
NATHAN:
"Come on, move."
Come on.
chris:
Take him inside.
MAN:
Don't push.
-l hear you're going after Eli Joe.
"-Yes, we are, ma'am."
-How long will you be gone?
-However long it takes.
"Way we figure, Eli Joe is just a day ahead of us."
Where to first?
-What's this all about?
-Thought you could use some help.
I'm much obliged.
But my business with this man is mine and mine alone.
"Got no argument there. lt's just, it's awful big country out there, is all."
- Fire Pete?
He can't fire Pete.
- I quit.
He can suck it.
"Yeah, suck it, Pete."
"No, you're not listening."
You're not a good listener.

Liz said we were cutting the cat-lady sketch.
She said it stinks.
This is why Liz is wrong.
Animal humour is universal.
I just don't think I'm good in it.
Do you think I'm good in it?
I think this is your opportunity and prove everybody wrong.
- What do you mean?
Who's everybody?
"- The network that wanted to fire you, the focus groups that said your eye is weird."
This eye?
"It doesn't open all the way because when I was little, my sister peed in it."
Tonight is your opportunity to go out there and change all of our minds.
What?
Where is Liz?
Liz!
Get down!
Four minutes to air.
That's four minutes to air.
- Is Liz back yet?
- No.
Which cat do you want Jenna to carry?
- I'm sorry?
- Which cat?
Stop it!
- Your boyfriend is not a killing machine
- ...you hoped for.
- Henry!
But you built a great punching bag.
- You stop it!
Stop it!
- What?
- You stop it!
- Estelle...
Aren't you curious what this fucker will do to this fucker?
No!
Henry!
"You're a fucking rabbit and headless, aren't you?"
I'm not here to hurt you.
Is your speech module installed?
Shit.
"Well, at least we know you're not deaf."
"It's alright, you can put your hands down now."
"Three years, I've been waiting for this moment... and I get Charlie fucking Chaplin."
"For fuck's sake, come on!"
"Well, let's have a look, chick."
"Open the glove-box, please."
And get that whole contraction.
You gotta untangle the wires.
Is that a wedding ring?
Are you...?
Are you married?
How's that working out for you?
"Yes, poor shocker."
Bright.
"Next, I need you to, uh... take your shirt off."
Some other time.
- You're here this afternoon?
- Yes.
Then come and see us.
I'm always here.
I'm often here at night too.
I'm an old hand here.
If you need anything...
- Thank you.
Good-bye.
- So long.
Mr.Roncero...
Good morning.
- Shall I get Dr.Vega?
"- No, carry on with your work."
"The other day, going through my papers,"
I found some notes I took the day you came to see me.
I'd written down a topic to discuss on your second visit.
A visit that never took place.
What topic?
Your sexual orientation.
My sexual orientation?
"Yes, your sexuality."
If you like men or women.
"When you came to see me, you said you were still a virgin."
Well...
"To answer your question in some way,"
I think I'm oriented more towards men.
Was that why you came to see me?
I can't remember now.
I guess so.
But I'm fine now.
I survived 37 hours of Gestapo interrogation.
That wasn't luck.
- Don't make the same mistake twice.
- What mistake?
Treating me differently.
Compromising our objective because of what you feel.
- Feel?
- For me?
You have no idea.
"Sister Miri, thank you"
- for all your help.
- I want to come with you.
I'm not a nun.
Mother's been sheltering me here for a month while those pigs are out there.
My father taught me to hunt.
To be proud.
He'd be ashamed to see me now... hiding.
"Please, let me hunt with you."
You've got two more bottles of whisky to get through before midnight.
- That is an order.
"- Yes, sir!"
Nice work.
"You got him, Tom."
He's not on board with the Fuhrer's policies.
But he is a patriot.
"Loves Germany, loyal to his brothers-in-arms."
Dreams of victory.
I'm surprised you're considering him.
He's a good kid.
You never know.
- We could get him working for us.
"- He's about your son's age, isn't he?"
- he's left the country?
"- On the contrary, sir."
"He's here in this room, sir."
Your banker's draft Sir Arthur
How did you know?
You smelt of Turkish tobacco - a kind you can't get in Spain.
You didn't touch your pork at the monastery
And remember speaking Yiddish in the coach?
"Sir, you are an edel mensh."
A gentleman
"Did you know about that banner, sir?"
"Well, I knew you'd risk your life for the army's wages, but I couldn't count on superstition."
Time to go.
"Hasta otra, Richard."
No.
Sir Arthur's pleased as punch.
"So you say, sir."
"Say, is it?"
And don't I have your promotion for first lieutenant in my pocket.
Wellesley's going to take the army into Spain.
"It'll be bugles, battles and bags of glory."
"Stick with me, Richard."
I'll see you right.
"You'll see me dead, sir."
That's my boy!
"Oh, well done, Pat."
Well done.

Give me a week.
You know I need the money up front.
You know I need the money up front.
Look!
"Look, my baby."
Those are all places where Daddy's been.
Look.
Where's that?
"In Australia, he travelled by bus."
He saw crocodiles.
"No, Mommy doesn't like them."
Or over in India.
"It was so filthy, he didn't like it either."
"And up here, the red pin, that's where we are, sweetie."
"That's where you and I are, in Daddy's room."
The green pins are where he's going this summer.
"All the way up to the cold, cold icebergs."
"I've never eaten baboon, but I've tasted every other animal."
Take the rancher.
who won't eat Warthog...
My wife made Wiener Schnitzel from Warthog.
"The rancher asked, ""What is it?"" My wife said, ""Wiener Schnitzel."""
His cook was about to tell him what it was.
I said to her.
"""Tell him and I'll slap you!"""
I said we'd tell him later ourselves.
He doesn't eat Warthog.
But he loved it.
I asked.
"""Know what you just ate?"
"Warthog."""
"""No way."
"That was a Wiener Schnitzel."""
"I said, ""See how wrong you can be?"""
'Cause a Warthog doesn't have dark meat like our wild boar.
Problem with the elevators?
"With 2, always 2."
"Hook, did you just see a little girl, in the hallway, maybe?"
I didn't see anyone.
"But then, half the lights are out again."
Abel to Security.
- It's Otto.
- And Hook.
The lights are out in West 1.
And Elevator 2 is acting up again.
"And Blondie, did you see him?"
No.
Flipping a breaker isn't a solution.
It's only a Band-Aid.
Did you see a little girl?
"If kids are wandering out of Paeds, Dr. James is going to be very unhappy."
I have never seen Dr. James unhappy.
There you are.
I've been so worried about you.
"Hon, stay on the lane, okay?"
I hate it when you run on the main road.
"It's October, in case you haven't noticed."
There's no traffic on the main road.
All the summer people went home a month ago...
God bless their pointy little heads.
"Well, still, it makes me nervous, so just stay on the lane, okay?"
- I suppose I could.
- Great.
"- And by the way, you were great."
- So were you.
- See you later.
"- Peter, what are you painting?"
I'll go with you ifyou go home.
Go home ?
"Get the hell away from me, you punk-ass bitch."
You're the one don't have the balls.
to walk away from this shit.
"I should have tookyour ass tojail along with mine, man."
"But you didn't, so you do not have to get in that car."
"Malakai, you are so much smarter than this shit."
I know what you can be.
I know what you're capable of.
Let'sjust walk away.
Walk away to what ?
"I'm not you, Derek."
I can't do nothing but what I'm doing.
"I can't go to Georgetown with a 1 0.0 G.P.A., operating on people, doing brain surgery..."
- or whateveryou're gonna be doing.
"- You can, man."
"- lf l can do it, you can do it."
- All I have is my respect.
Andthat's what lgotta go take care of.
"You wanna bail out on me, man ?"
That's fline.
But you can kiss my ass with all your future bullshit.
I know who the hell I am...
right now.
"Kai, man, wait, man."
"Let's go, man."
[CarEngineStarts]
Sara ?
Ready to go ?
Um--
Yes.
- I just— I gotta—
- What are you doing?
- Call you back.
- Excuse me.
"Moe, I apologize."
He just walked in here.
"I'm sorry for rushing in like this, but you were right."
"They tried to kill him like you said, but he got away."
Now he's runnin' through the woods.
He's like a scared animal.
He's scared to death.
That motherfucker should be scared.
His uncle got this case closed with one phone call.
"I'm sorry it took so long for me to come around, but you were right."
I couldn't see the truth.
"Like you said, the evidence, my loyalty, they were confusing."
They never give you any napkins in this place.
What am I supposed to use?
You want this?
What is this?
"You came to me, to my town... with all these speeches, talking about doing the right thing."
I'm doing the right thing.
What's goin' on?
What are you doing?
That was like two weeks ago.
Two weeks ago?
- What about Babitch?
- What about him?
Fuck him.
- What about Donlan?
- Fuck him too.
What about Joey Randone?
Why should my wife make dog food?
We haven't even got a dog!
"Now, look, I could be wrong."
Anybody can make a mistake.
"Well, you certainly are wrong."
I don't think I am.
"But if you want to make sure,"
I'll get Charlie.
He raises dogs.
-(chuckling):
Dog food.
-Charlie.
"Boy, jealousy, sometimes."
I'm telling you.
"Well, it'd better not be!"
"Yes, Mr. Peck?"
"Charlie, do you know what that is?"
I should know.
I've been using this for years.
It's dog food.

"You know, Alice, a French name would be cute for him."
"Well, I'll worry about a name for him after I get Ralph to agree to let me keep him."
"I told you, you're worrying over nothing."
"Once Ralph gets a look at that little face, he's got to fall in love with it."
"Well, I hope so."
"You know something, Trix,"
I never realized what wonderful company a little pup is around the house all day.
"You know, this day just flew by."
Sure.
"That reminds me, I gotta be getting back upstairs."
- Please.
"Rick, please, I didn't mean to start anything like this."
Please just let me hold you.
You need to sleep.
"Lil, I'll call you."
It'll be okay. lt will.
You wouldn't want to be a flower girl.
[Zoe] How would you know?
You're supposed to look like a robot who marches up the aisle dropping rose petals.
- What's wrong with that?
- l'm so glad you're not making this complete spectacle with this wedding.
"What if you have two flower girls, me and Jessie?"
Mom?
- Mom.
- lt's okay.
What's the matter?
Nothing. I'll tell you later.
"Mom, are you okay?"
[whispering] No.
"No, honey, I'm not, but I will be."
"Oh, Mom."
I'm okay.
"- [woman] Karen Sammler's here,"
"- Oh, great."
"Oh, uh, how you doing?"
[stammering] I want you to know how much I appreciate this.
- l'm not doing this for you.
- l didn't mean...
- lt's for my clients.
- Of course.
And I need something from you in return.
I didn't know you engage in back-scratching.
Like you give a fuck.
- You never even asked me why.
- Because I don't care.
Think you're the only one who's ever screwed up?
"Well, boo-hoo-hoo, Tommy."
"Life sometimes sucks and that's that, but not all of us have so much self-pity we need to kill ourselves."
How the fuck would you know?
With your head stuck up your arse all day!
How the fuck would I know?
"'Cause I'm standing on a bridge in the middle of fuck knows where, covered in cow shit, fighting a fat, old Irishman dressed in a kimono."
And all because his daughter hates him and seems to quite like me.
Come on.
Budge up.
"Come on, now."
Come on.
Here.
For fuck's sake.
Hey!
Where are you going?
"Eh, Paul, wait!"
"Wait, you fucker."
Wait for me.
- You can forget about tomorrow.
- Good.
- Find some other poor fucker.
I won't be there.
- So?
- Fuck you!
"- No, fuck you!"
"Tommy, you're an arsehole."
Tommy?
"That's so childish, mate."
"No, a cash trail is very fucking bad for us."
- Oh.
"- Hey, hold on there, Hunk of the Month."
"If I'm going down, you're going down, too."
I don't know what this is about.
Good point.
Dan and Amy.
They're getting paid cash from the campaign fund to bring down the bill.
"There, you've been blooded."
So join the circle jerk.
Grab a dick.
Wish I could hear what you were saying over that incessant drilling sound.
- What are you doing?
Shh!
What cash?
What Dan and Amy?
Ben's paying Dan and Amy to lobby against the bill and now there's a cash trail and we're all incriminated.
But you're not.
"Oh, my God, now you are!"
Well done.
Now I feel a lot better.
"Did you know, Tom?"
"Ma'am, I am as shocked as you are."
"Shocked and disappointed, Ben."
"Ma'am, Moyes is voting yes."
Ruiz is voting yes.
This comes down to one vote.
We need Congressman Pierce.
My future depends on that dumb fucking elf?
Jeez... where is he?
I'm so proud of how brave you've been.
"I was looking for some lotion, but they didn't..."
"Soon, I imagine."
Good.
I will wait.
"So I wait and wait and wait and wait, and still she doesn't come or call or anything."
What makes you so sure she didn't know you were there and why?
What kind of talk is that?
"- Please, Carl."
- Please what?
Why do you need a woman to do things for you?
To ask about things?
This is none of your business.
"Well, you sure don't need help from the lady who fixed up your contract with Somers in the first place."
You be quiet!
"Oh, stop it, Axel."
Both of you.
Stop it.
"So, what about you, Lisa?"
"You think I'm becoming a mouse, too?"
Huh?
All right!
I show you!
I show everybody!

"I'll get it, Della."
Mason speaking.
"No, no, you just caught me."
We've been working late.
"Mr. Mason, you'll be in your office first thing in morning, yes?"
"Well, I'll be here, but I have a calendar full of appointments."
Cancel them.
I be there at 9 sharp.
And then you fix Somers for me.
Who's Danny Moore?
He's been talking about a beating on you.
Who is he?
- I don't know who he is!
- That kid you bumped into
- and then called a shortarse.
- That was Jay.
You'll have to go and knock him out now.
- Teach him a lesson.
"- If you see him,"
- tell him it's a mistake.
- I'm not getting involved.
He's from a hard family in Northwood.
His brother did time.
"Oh, Northwood?"
"Been nice knowing you, Si!"
"What's this, my dad's bigger than your dad?"
"What are we, 12?"
"- I think he is 12, actually."
"- You're not scared are you, Si?"
"No, it's just I'm not going to look cool beating up a kid."
- And you couldn't.
"- Yes, I could, can we just leave it?"
I'm not fighting anyone.
"Oh yeah, nice one."
Mature.
"Compared to Simon, my first day was turning out OK."
"After a morning of pretending cars were broken and overcharging middle-class women, we had bonded over a pint."
"Thanks, guys."
That was a much more civilised way to welcome me.
It's shame we won't get to do it again...
"Oh, no!"
How nice.
Look at this.
It's worthless.
Ten dollars from a vendor in the street.
"But I take it, I burry it in the sand for a thousand years it becomes priceless."
Like the Ark.
"Men will kill for it, men like you and me."
What about your boss?
Der Führer?
I thought he was waiting to take possession.
All in good time.
When I am finished with it.
"Jones, do you realize what the Ark is?"
It's a transmitter.
It's a radio for speaking to God.
And it's within my reach.
You want to talk to God?
Let's go see him together.
I've got nothing better to do!
Doctor Indy!
Come back home now!
"Next time, Indiana Jones, it will take more than children to save you."
I thought I would find you there.
"Better than the United States Marines, eh?"
Marion is dead.
"Yes, I know."
I am sorry.
"Life goes on, Indy."
There is the proof.
I have much to tell you.
"First we will take them home, and then I will take you to the old man."
I can't figure out how Belloq did it.
- Is it a conspiracy?
- I have not even heard coming.
- I opened it.
- Come in the living room?
- I was going in the kitchen.
Idiot.
He has the courage André.
He loves me.
I am sure that I prefer my mother.
"If I'm with him, is to recite better in the theater, you understand."
Forbid you to judge.
You have confused ideas to do this.
Finally.
All right.
It's clean!
"So, enlightened, ports reports of Mickey Marie?"
- I do not know where they are ...
- You are as Marie.
Put it where the Chiappe.
I told you that I would found.
He is my dog.
My brother of sugar.
He knows the future.
"Your future we'll leave, but this leaves me!"
"Marie has paid his return ticket, is the price."
The trip was a surprise and this is priceless.
So no cheating with your whistle.
Do not you know far more to be a man?
Shut up you.
"I Don't trust you, Albert."
The good Lord has addressed if one tries not to understand ...
"Hit, Albert ..."
That makes 12.75.
An elastic band around it?
Here's 13.
-And 25 cents change.
5 nickels is ok too.
-Or 2 dimes and a nickel.
"Or 25 cents, right Auntie Cor?"
-I could barely carry that.
"What can I do for you, sir?"
The working man isn't interested in the revolution.
Must be too expensive.
Beautiful books about the revolution that nobody wants to buy.
What can I do for you?
"Hey, a first edition."
This is an antiquarian book.
It's been here for years.
No one will buy it like this.
Let alone follow its example.
"No, they'd rather buy this junk."
Rather than Marx and his revolution.
Ab.
Ab from the assault group.
-I thought you'd never recognize me.
"Yes, I've changed."
Hair doesn't grow on brains.
It also doesn't grow on sandy soils.
Did you want to buy all these books?
You could give them to your capitalist friends.
They've already got them all.
Or else their children.
I've come to get you.
I found him.
Admit what I did.
Lily's away on a trip with some friends.
I want to speak with her first.
"After that, I'll speak with the press."
"Hopefully, the fact that there's going to be"
A press conference will be enough
To keep mr.
Gerwin at bay for a day.
I'm gonna miss this place.
Regal man:
Excuse me.
This is for you.
Wow.
"You already have my, uh, $92.18?"
"No, it's just what you gave me yesterday."
I can't keep it.
I don't care what you say.
"You know, uh,"
I've only been doing this for a couple of weeks.
I'm not proud of it.
"It's just, uh, I haven't worked in a while,"
And I was hoping to get a little bit of money coming in.
"But the truth is, your $38 was all I got,"
"And, uh, I didn't set out to swindle little girls."
So you're not a prince?
why are you dressed like that?
Bridgette?
"When you're done with those, would you come help me"
"In the children's section, please?"
"Yeah, sure."
"Um, miss aiken,"
This is prince abantu.
-Cooperate.
I like your reason.
Do you like my uniform?
I purposely prepared a white dress.
"If I let down my hair and wear heels, I'm really pretty."
More than the bride.
How is it?
So the concept for today is...
"You know if from first sight, right?"
Is it a virgin ghost?
It's an angel.
Let's go.
So what you're saying is that the person that Myeong Joo's father approved of is you?
Yes.
Please wait here for a moment.
- Let's go.
- Wait a minute.
"So you are saying Sergeant Major Seo, Myeong Joo and you were a love triangle?"
Yes.
Hold my hand.
And it's still valid?
- Yes.
- Then how about your opinion?
Why are you curious about my opinion?
When was it that you dumped me...
I am just asking.
I am just asking.
I am not curious about your opinion.
Your earlier facial expression seems very curious.
Sit.
Hold on tight.
And don't fly away.
"OK, Number Two."
Right.
Go!
"OK, Number Three."
"Stand by, Number Three."
Ready.
Go!
Look at mine.
"Oh, the silly, clumsy clot."
"OK, Number Five."
They're not a bad bunch.
I've seen worse.
Gardner!
From now on I'm in business strictly with you.
"Nothing like an old, established firm."
Heavy.
Hm.
How about a drink tonight?
I might be able to manage...
Have a nice trip?
You didn't have to push me.
"No offence, just trying to help."
I don't need that kind of help.
What makes you such a ruddy hero?
It just ain't natural.
If he puts his hands on me again I'll brain him.
How about that drink?
"Thank you, but this firm doesn't mix business with pleasure."
"Gentlemen, we don't know one another very well yet."
This morning you start your training and we can start to find out.
Now for myself.
"Information, I'm a professional soldier."
"Lawrence, I hate to be blunt."
"Maybe it's my age or my inability to be coy anymore in my life, but are you gay?"
"I mean, it's fine."
I have a son who's gay and I am a proud member of PFLAG.
- Are you... disappointed?
- No.
I'm curious.
I'm...
Why...?
Why date women?
I love women!
"I love their companionship, their friendship."
"I just want someone to go to museums, parties, take dancing."
Does that sound pathetic?
No.
"No, it sounds very familiar."
"If you want to call it a night, I'd understand."
"No, Lawrence."
Absolutely not.
We haven't eaten.
I'm starving to death.
You want to share an order of edamame with me?
- What time did you tell the sitter?
"- Twelve, latest."
It's 10:30 now.
This is ridiculous.
"Oh, God!"
Is that vomit?
I don't want to get close enough to confirm or deny.
This is the worst date night ever.
It's Betsy.
"Hey Betsy, what's up?"
"I'm fucking with you, Cooper."
I told you to come up here to see if we've broken you enough to obey instructions without question.
- And we have.
"- Oh, no, no, no."
"Katie, come on."
"Katie, come on, let me out!"
"Katie, let me out, come on!"
What the fuck!
"Oh, what are you gonna do?"
"Oh, what are you doing to me?"
- Why are you doing this?
- You thought you'd see your mother.
"- Oh, fuck!"
- What does she look like?
"Your mother, can you describe her face?"
Her hair colour?
She...
"Is she tall, short, fat, thin?"
- Where did you grow up?
- She...
What's your favourite band?
Your favourite flavour ice cream?
The name of the girl who stabbed you?
"You don't know any of these things, do you?"
Don't you think that's odd?
It's fucking taking my memories!
"Overwriting them, technically."
Fuck.
Look in the mirror behind you.
Do you recognize yourself?
Do you even know who you're looking at?
Soon you won't be anything.
- Course west-sou'west.
- West-sou'west!
- Lookout!
- Sail on the starboard quarter!
Sail?
Where?
I see only ships in anchor.
"Deck, there!"
Sail is an enemy frigate!
And another!
The French are out!
The French!
"Weigh anchor, beat to quarters."
The French are on the move.
Make to all ships.
Prepare to engage.
- They used the fog too.
- They're heading for our squadron.
Look.
That red glow.
"A fire ship, set on course in the breeze."
- She'll take the flagship!
- They can't move in time.
- Nor the others.
- They're going to burn!
"Vizard, I'm striking no bargains, and making no promises."
This ship is in your hands.
"There's nothing to stop you from running, but the enemy is there."
- All hands muster aft!
"- Lively, there!"
Sir.
"Well, lads, you see what's happening."
Lock down the building!
This is Ryan Chappelle.
Nina Myers is loose in the building.
"Lock it down, now!"
"Nina, drop the gun and put your hands on your head, now!"
Kim.
What the hell are you doing?
You don't want to be any part of this.
Shut up.
Just turn around and walk away.
"If you leave now, you won't get hurt."
Kim.
"Don't do it, Nina."
"I swear to god, I'll shoot you."
You won't kill me.
"Nina, damn it."
"Kim, back up."
Back up.
"Kim, I want you to go back into CTU, tell them we got Nina."
"- Dad, listen to me."
We need...
"- Kim, go now!"
"Please, baby, just go."
Go.
"You don't have any more useful information, do you, Nina?"
I do.
"No, you don't."
Tony Almeida has just informed us that they were unable to confiscate this Cordilla virus in Mexico.
"This man Amador, where is he now?"
Latest working theory is that Amador has this virus and is headed back here to Los Angeles.
I let you live.
- Right.
- This is Lewis Carroll's mirror.
Alice in Wonderland.
"""Off with their heads""."
"- That's chick lit, right?"
- Chick lit?
"I mean, come on."
Not everything in here is dangerous.
You got that cuddly little ferret from a cooking pot.
"- Yeah, he peed in my shoes."
- That was...
That was me.
- That's funny.
"- So what, are you still mad at Artie?"
"No, I'm not."
- I'm not mad at Artie.
I'm mad at you.
"- No, you're not mad at me."
"- Yes, I am."
- You're not mad at me.
"Because when you're mad at me, your neck gets all long until it looks like that."
It's like a giraffe over here.
"And when you're mad at Artie, your neck gets down over here to the right."
Just like that.
"Look, I know the MacPherson-DC thing is still bugging you, okay?"
But everybody has a past.
"But he lied, Pete."
"Artie's past is treasonous, hazardous, there's a crazy man who wants us dead and he wants the Warehouse for himself."
Would have been nice knowing that going in.
Artie should have told us about MacPherson.
"Yes, yes, I get it."
Daddy issues.
!
"When you're hungover, it's like a car alarm."
"Ay. iHola, papi!"
Happy graduation day!
"(party horn blowing, laughs)"
That's delightful.
I need your sash and your gown.
So that I can press it.
I don't want anyone looking wrinkly.
(chuckles)
"I don't mean you, but it's fun that you're right there."
"I, uh, left them at school."
I'll run over there.
"Mama, I have a stomachache."
And my ankle is broken.
(gasps) And you can walk with your broken ankle?
I had a cousin got out of Vietnam that way.
"Whenever Manny's getting a lot of attention,"
Joe gets very needy...
"""my head,"" ""my arm."""
"In Colombia, we say,"
"""If it's not bleeding, shut your guinea-pig hole."""
We actually do eat guinea pig.
(beep)
"Call me back, Dad!"
It's an emergency!
What's wrong?
I kind of misplaced my cap and gown and sash.
Maybe they're at that strip club you went to last night.
Shh!
How did you know?
- It's all over your face.
"Bev, my wife."
"No, I know who bev is."
Who's rob?
Morning's brother.
With the truck.
What truck?
He had a truck!
"Anyway, last week, before we got back together, she slept with him."
No shit?
And she told you?
"To her credit, she felt we needed to be honest."
"What, is she stupid?"
"And this was gonna be your big, like,"
"""finally back together"" weekend?"
Yeah.
"For fans of irony, it's a real treat."
Man.
I figured you two would be fucking like bunnies.
More like bunnies with awkward silences and sullen looks.
I actually slept on the sofa.
Seriously?
"Well, I don't want to sleep in her bed."
She doesn't want to sleep in mine.
That's not good for the bunnies.
No.
"I'm sure, eventually, we'll get past this, but oh, my God!"
I was so not prepared for something else I had to get past.
"I mean, it would be one thing if he was the only one."
Christ.
Who else?
"Yes, yes."
We all love the draft.
"Yes, sir."
What are those things?
What?
Those things moving up and down.
Oil rigs.
"When those things are moving up and down, it means times are good."
Looks like times are good.
Shoot.
We must have left some of them back in Florida.
Left what?
I packed a couple of boxes with socks and things.
I could've sworn --
"Jimmy, did you find that one box?"
"Oh, no."
"It's okay, Mom."
"Don't worry, honey."
We'll find it.
I've never known a boy to get so upset about losing his socks.
His glove was in there.
His what?
His glove was in there.
"Oh, quit moping and grab a box."
Did you hear me?
There are more important things in life than baseball.
"The sooner you figure that out, the better."
"This Lee Ivaco-cocus guy,"
"I guarantee you, within two years, three years tops, he's gonna run that company right out of business."
"Ain't that right, young man?"
Eileen?
Eileen!
I guess she gone to lunch.
"Help you find something, son?"
I think somebody needs to work on their sense of humor.
It was a joke.
Oh.
I'm Monica.
Got it.
Monica.
"So, Mike- Yes?"
What sort of impression do I make?
Come again?
If we were in a bar and you hadn't seen me before.
Oh.
Can I speak candidly?
I insist you speak candidly.
I'd think you were a hot piece of ass.
Good answer.
- Sarasvati.
"- Yes, Miss Mancuso?"
You told me you would have the opening day revenue report by now.
Where is it?
I'm afraid it's still being prepared.
Unacceptable.
Mr. Deline had some special requests.
He suggested you speak to him.
Come on.
Show some cleavage.
"It's a casino, not a convent."
"Okay, okay."
That's me taking the first counterfeit I found.
"Now, let's run it backwards... until we see that specific tray being removed from the cart."
All right?
Wow.
That's an easy gig.
It's going straight to voicemail.
Voicemail?
"Just chill, okay?"
Count your money.
"Combo, you seen Badger?"
Don't you cover for him!
"I ask you a straight-up question,"
I expect a straight-up answer!
Well?
They were too scared to tell me.
Badger got busted.
He's in jail.
"Honey, I'm home!"
Too slow!
What's up?
You've got more lives than a damn cat.
Now if I can only learn to lick myself.
"What's up, guys?"
Good to see you.
All right!
"Let's all go back to work, for Christ's sake!"
"In my office, man."
Let's see what you bozos have been up to lately.
You okay?
Hanging in?
What's it look like?
What's this from APD?
I been checking with them to see if they come across that famous blue meth of yours.
"Sure enough, last night."
Got themselves an honest-to-God dealer.
I was thinking of cruising over and saying hello.
Maybe you'd like to go with me.
"So, um, so just out there."
Anybody could tell that old man wasn't...
You can't assume anything about anybody in a case like this.
That's the guy that's going to fuck you.
Damn right.
Shit.
"I been police chief here for, hell, going on, uh, six years."
I never even had to draw my gun.
"Good night, you."
Can you kiss your favorite mommy?
Get in the bed.
Get in there.
Get in the bed.
"See you in the morning, okay?"
"Good night, mommy."
Night.
Enjoying yourself?
Getting enough to eat and drink?
"Well, just about."
"That's your second bottle, isn't it?"
"Yes, it is."
I want to apologize about Dale's comment.
Bet John feels terrible.
Dale didn't mean anything by it.
He just grew up talking that way.
"Well, I understand, and I'm..."
I'm sure John does too.
"These people are pretty dangerous, aren't they?"
"Yes, ma'am, they are."
"You know, I've never seen Dale this excited before."
I guess this is about the biggest thing that's ever happened to him.
"This case, I mean."
- Knew it.
- Okay.
"All right, well, uh, what does his relationship status on his Facebook say?"
"""Facebook""?"
"I don't know, Grandpa."
We don't have a typewriter.
- Snap.
"- Oh, come on, Facebook is on a compute..."
"No, no, no, stop talking, because the more you say, the older we get."
"Okay, fine, I won't say anything."
"No, no, no!"
We can actually help this child.
"Unlike Lark, she's telling us what's wrong in words we can understand."
"Yeah, we're gonna tell you"
"- what you do here, okay?"
- Yes.
Just go over there.
"No, if we get too close, he might recognize us."
"Okay, well, uh, here."
He won't recognize us.
(stammers) He didn't know what we looked like before.
"Yeah, of course."
"Hey, will you put this on my birthday list?"
"Yeah, okay, one stupid hat."
Got it.
"What's up, Broseph Stalin?"
You looking for something special?
Maybe for a special someone?
You work here?
"- Yeah, we do."
We for sure do.
- Yeah.
Then...
I'll go with someone else.
Don't forget to pick me up!
Didn't you say that you don't like movie?
"I did, but I didn't say I will not go!"
Xiaotian!
- Has the class over?
"- Yes, why are you here ?"
Didn't you say you have no vacation?
The brigade dispatched us here to borrow equipment.
"I just want too see you, so I asked for one day off."
But I have to report the task at 7 a.m tomorrow.
It just one night?
Many things you can do in one night!
Well...
"The key car, it's for you."
"There is some clothes for change, too."
"Inside the packet of clothes, you'll find something you need!"
What is it?
I'm feeling uneasy to tell it!
Isn't it distracting?
It is.
You may take that off.
- Xiamu...
- It's 6 p.m.
"Yes, it is."
6 p.m?
Sorry!
Sorry!
I forgot.
Come here immediately!
I can't go now.
I've got a ride.
Emily.
"No, it's me."
Spencer.
"It's really very nice of you, but I'm here now."
I'm going with Spencer.
I see.
"Hanna, the man's ID checked out."
It checked out because there was a James Leland related to Mrs. Potter but this isn't him.
This is somebody else.
"If I tell the state people some story about the man being an imposter it'll just draw attention, which we do not want."
"Well, we have to do something."
I'm not doing anything based on what Caleb says.
Leland's coming to the bank.
I will show him the safe deposit box.
And we will go from there.
"- All right, well, call me when he leaves."
- I will.
Hey.
I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
"Uh, change of plans."
Good.
I'll take you and Mike out for dinner later.
Okay?
"Hey, Dad?"
How were the parent-teacher meetings?
"Oh, they were fine."
"You know, I really like that one teacher, your French teacher."
"- Well, how do you like Mr. Fitz?"
- He was okay.
Okay?
"All right, listen, I'm gonna tell you the truth."
I dunno.
A bag bag.
Was it a suitcase or an overnight bag?
"Yeah, that's it."
An overnight bag.
"He goes out for a jog, like you said, and then... ..he comes back out with a bag."
What was I supposed to do?
Did anything happen to spook him?
Did he see you?
Of course not.
What?
"If we mess this up, they will find you dead of an overdose and I'll be back in prison waiting for someone to stab me in the showers"
"Better hope he hasn't gone far, Calum."
Iain?
What do you mean a runner?
Just took off all of a sudden.
Find him for me.
And then what?
Operation Merlin's all but dead and buried.
"""I want him dealt with, John."
"And this time no guns."""
"John, I finally cracked it."
It's churros.
What are you talking about?
Those Spanish doughnut things you dip in hot chocolate after you've been out all night.
?
?
"So again last night, the wife got a call around 10:30."
It's the husband calling to say good night.
Exactly.
He's always calling.
They must like each other.
Everybody loved Stacks.
He was supposed to do was steal the panel truck and afterwards compact it by a friend of ours out in Jersey.
Only Morrie was driving us nuts.
Morrie...
Have a drink and shut up.
Just because he set this up he felt he could bust Jimmies balls for an advance on the money we were going to steal.
He didn't mean anything by it.
That's just the way he was.
I had everybody working for me.
"Even our old baby-sitter, Lois Byrd."
D'ya have a good flight?
I hate Pittsburgh.
Where'd you find such creeps?
They're not that bad.
"And it's worth it, isn't it?"
is this the same baby you used last week?
"No, that one was my sister's."
This is Deirdra's.
Big yawn.
"She looks just like you, Lois."
That's what the stewardess said.
-Yeah...
"Take it easy, Sandy."
"Come on, Henry..."
Give me a break.
You got enough here to go around.
You got all day.
"Just make it last, all right?"
Take it easy.
-l got to go.
-Where are you going?
Don't start.
What?

See you soon.
"Welcome to London, Mr Heisenberg."
"I'm Major Julie Smith, Special Operations Executive."
I'm in charge of the debriefing of the German atomic programme.
Would you care to follow me?
Sheriff knows who did it.
I saw him going down to Peterson's a little while ago with some evidence some kid gave him.
He found it in an RV or something down there.
Those Peterson's will probably get that kid.
What kid?
"Some damn tourist kid, I don't know."
[Man on the phone] Yeah.
Yeah.
"You know, a sky pilot once said that angels carried messages up to heaven, Buddy."
He might tell him.
"Come on, don't cry anymore."
"[Buddy] All right, I won't cry no more."
"[Jim] Buddy, look here, you got to buck up and be a little man now."
"If Tater knows you was crying about him that way, he'd feel awful bad."
- Good morning.
"- Good morning, Miss Molly."
[Molly] ...how many people we should notify?
[Jim] I guess me and Buddy...
"Hi, Billy."
Go away.
"What'd you do that for, Billy?"
Now you've got yourself stuck in there.
- Just be quiet and go away.
- [phone ringing] [continues ringing]
It's the telephone.
Billy?
It's for you.
"I don't care, answer it."
"I'll tell you somethin', Billy."
What?
You got a hollow door here.
It's made in Japan.
What are you doing here?
Oh.
"I, um--"
I came to pick out a dress for Hilla's funeral.
And to listen to her records while you read her diary?
"It's, uh, in German."
"Look, Stephanie, I am the coroner."
That doesn't give you the right to go through her things.
She was beautiful.
My camera loved her.
You took that?
It's a hobby I'd hoped to turn into a profession.
Hillie and I were gonna go back to New York together.
"She was gonna be a big fashion model, and I'd shoot all her covers."
She'd have made it too.
"I keep expecting her to walk through the door, you know?"
Hillie understood life better than most people.
Maybe because she'd seen so much death.
That's why I can't believe she killed herself.
Maybe she didn't.
- What do you mean?
- She may have been murdered.
"Oh, God."
Do you have any idea who may have done it?
No.
Everyone loved her.
No one... would want her dead.
What?
Nothing.
It's not nothing.
What are you thinking?
Truesdale fired her.
"I'll be looking for you in the destroyed fields, Bishop."
"Ok Kix, since you have so much energy tonight  why do not you take the first guard?"
Have fun with your book.
Mara!
"Come on, Bishop."
"Get up, Spartan."
There is something in the trees.
I'll send you back to hell!
Yellow-eyed devil!
Bishop...
"I've marked it, Commander."
I marked it clearly for you.
"Bishop, I'm here."
Did you miss the fucking shot?
10 meters away?
"You are the total ruin, man."
Did not Trajan take you out of the sewer?
I would be a damned commander!
And my team would still be alive!
"Now it's your turn, Bishop."
"Alpha, Mike, Foxtrot  bye, son of a bitch!"
"Listen, or you'll never pull the trigger again."
You do not have the eggs.
Reckless bitch!
"Mara, they were wrong."
There is life in the area of death.
I will not resign.
"I will not stop, Before we find our daughter."
You are with me my love
You're here with me now.
Ash!
"Come on, my friend."
Okay.
Hey.
Hey.
"I love you, okay?"
"You know that, don't you?"
I know that.
And I love that little girl in that room more than anything in this world.
I know that too.
Come on.
(CAR DOOR CLOSING)
(ENGINE STARTING)
BILLY:
"Hey, I would give you every dime we talked about, if I had the money."
The problem is I just don't have it.
Your partner here is starting to make me nervous.
"Why don't you sit your narrow ass down, ponytail?"
"Look, I know you guys are on the run."
And you need everything you can get.
"It's better than nothing, right?"
Let's lighten up.
"Look, this town is hot, and so are you, brother."
You fucked up.
You're on every goddamn channel.
You got no one else out there you can trust but me.
And I'm gonna let you walk with one.
What I'm telling you is take it or leave it... (GROANING)
Fucker.
Eight fucking dollars.
Liar!
Ugh!
(EMPTY CLICKING)
"Hey, wait a minute, he's got to have more money than that."
The movie director?
Yeah.
Shooting a film over on 1.
"""Gladiators."""
It's gonna make a billion in China.
"Oh, h-hold on."
You don't think that Austin had something to do with Phil's murder?
Was Austin filming last night?
He was supposed to.
"But for some reason, he shut down production early and took off."
About what time did he leave the lot?
I heard around 11:00.
Why?
Giving him lots of time to get to that cemetery.
Where do we find Stage 1?
You work out?
[Bell ringing]
Hayley:
"Oh, look."
There's Austin.
"So, how do you want to play this?"
"Well, if he did kill Phillip Harris, he's bound to be on guard, so we can't let him know that we are looking at him as a suspect."
Kendall?
!
"Oh, she's good. [Chuckles]"
How did she get onto Austin so quick?
We're done for.
"She's already got him wrapped around her skinny, little finger."
Don't say I never did anything for you.
"There you are, darling."
Mm.
"So, who's our new friend?"
Maybe not.
"When I went back to search rebecca's place,"
I found this between the couch pillows.
Rebecca shot herself.
I think so.
"She lost a lot today Her fiancee,her life savings."
Her respect.
Could have been a failed suicide attempt.
Or a bid f sympathy.
Or an attemptto escape discovery that she had sex with finn the day she died.
"What's your gut tell you,boss?"
Take your shirt off.
Here we go.
I know it's kind of messy.
"Thshirt,mcgee,take it off now."
Take it down to abby.
Or would you rather wait for a search warrant?
Rebecca's dna.
I need to borrow one of your shirts.
You afraid all that white might burn out abby's corneas?
Do not make me walk around like this all day.
Come on.Help me out.
All right.
I can't resist a damsel in distress.
****************************
"Wow,it's just like chippende'S... without the bow ties or muscles."
Givee a second.
I just have to finish this e-mail to kofi annan.
Kofi can wait.
"What is it,jethro?"
The finn case.
Yes?
"But with some sound advice and the proper introduction, who knows?"
I'll tell you one thing.
You've got the right product.
"Anything that gets the DEA's panties in this big of bunch, you are on to something special."
And I would like to be a small and silent part of it.
"Full for thought, yeah?"
"So, if you want to make more money and keep the money that you make,"
Better call Saul!
Hey.
You...
You selling?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Okay.
That's cool.
"I'm just saying, you know, if you were selling I could maybe do with a teenth."
"You're kidding, right?"
"Dude, I so smell bacon."
What?
What are you talking about?
"Oh, gee, I don't know."
How about over there.
That brown van.
"That's yours, right?"
What brown van?
Parked all inconspicuous.
It's a cop van.
"Yeah, another one right over there."
"""Duke City Flowers""?"
Come on.
Can't you at least be original?
"Dude, I just wanna get high."
"Yes, sir."
This is driving me up the wall.
Don't pay any attention to the crazy girl's talk.
Not her.
I'm talking about this.
Family Tragedy Linked To Wild Mushrooms
"""Murdered by... wild mushrooms""?"
What did the dermatologist say?
Mushrooms?
"He wasn't sure, so he referred Heung-guk to the hospital."
Told you.
It can't be the mushrooms.
It's not impossible.
Shut your hole.
You know that story Byeong-gyu told you?
There are so many.
The one about the naked man eating the deer carcass.
What's gotten into you?
At a crazy time like this?
It's because things are so crazy.
"You know the guy who saw it, right?"
"""Herbs  Tonics"""
Over here.
"You may not believe it, but I saw it with my own eyes."
Look at this.
Can you see it?
Sure.
I got 22 stitches.
From falling on your head while you were drunk?
What are you talking about?
I'm too old to make shit up.
You got proof?
She's given her statement.
Read it.
Shiv brought me to Kurukshetra... which is 142 kilometres from Delhi... and raped me in this car.
Enough.
I'll handle it from here.
Heard that.
Anything that you say anything that you don't say... will definitely be used against you.
Ayushman you don't know...
You don't know that rape is a serious crime.
No bail and along prison sentence.
You'll live like a dog get that.
You're trying to trap me in this.
Dimple's lying.
- You know...
- Who's lying?
She's lying.
Will a decent girl defame herself?
Did she bring you here?
Did she bring you here?
You didn't bring her.
She... drugged the water.
She made you drink it.
She got you unconscious.
Listen boy.
It's all about facts and figures.
You were stuck on her figure.
And the fact is... that you're a bloody rapist.
Understand.
Come out.
Ayushman what are you doing?
Come on.
Ayushman this is wrong.
Is that what I'm doing with Erica?
Making her decisions for her?
What do you think?
You can't deny the fact that Kai...
He has become a distraction.
Maybe he has.
But why does that preclude him from being a necessary part of Erica's journey?
Especially if she wants him to be?
How did you know when--when I was ready?
You knew.
And you let me know.
Thank you.
Fred?
Hey.
Cheers.
"So, what do they do to doctors who crash and burn?"
Same thing they do to doctors who quit.
I heard about that.
Yeah.
"Uh, not my finest moment."
Mmm.
"You know, this thing that we do, it's not easy."
No kidding.
I can't reach him.
I've tried everything I can think of.
Sometimes you need a little help.
I did.
"Yeah, well, no one's offered."
"Well, consider this an offer."
"Hey, I'm not saying it's gonna change anything,"
"But if you wanted me to,"
I'd be happy to give it a try.
And then I- I do the rest.
"You know, I'd really like to know how you got me to do this."
You and I both.
What are you thinking?
You're just- You're really-
You're very beautiful.
Don't sound so surprised.
(SCOFFS) No.
"No, I guess it takes a moment like this to wake a guy up, so he can actually see what's right in front of him."
That's our cue.
(GASPS)
(LIGHTER FLICKS)
IVAN: it's amazing.
"Even hazy and out of focus, you can still recognize your own silhouette."
I wondered all day- How?
How is this possible?
"So, Marcus here is going to babysit."
And you-
You're going to take me to see what's over there.
(IVAN CHUCKLES)
I would not have believed you if you'd told me.
Kicks them out every night at 8:00.
Yeah.
What about the daytime ones?
I don't know.
"Since we found it, it's only been doing 'em at night."
What's this?
"Uh, it's- it's the newest one."
Okay-
Okay-
Here's the deal.
Every day you're going to take this photo.
I don't know about not telling Emma.
If I don't...
What if Miguel is right?
You said you don't want to stress Emma out.
You let me know if you find anything out.
"Maggie, hold up."
I trust Miguel.
He'll get this sorted out.
"Like deciding not to tell Emma, and then, swapping glances like you're teenage boys"
- getting away with things again?
- That's not what just happened.
"Look, I've raised Emma on my own since you left."
"I've made mistakes, but I didn't have any help."
- That's not fair.
You know I had to leave.
"- Now, you're back, and you think that you and Emma almost being killed"
"No, listen."
I
-Pragmatic.
"No, I did."
"No, you are."
I'm a realist.
-You are scared.
-I'm not afraid.
It is not our first time.
I'm not scared.
I'm not scared.
-OK. -unhappy Himself.
"I'm just very, very unhappy."
You're so...
"You are so wonderful, and you're so..."
"The sensitive and romantic, and..."
Same reason I never wear mine.
-What?
"-Uh, forget it."
"Hey, did you hear about the underground show?"
"Apparently, they've got some big name spinning."
You mean like a rave?
Is it still a rave if you don't roll?
I just call it a party.
"But hey, I got a friend who can hook us up with tickets if you're down."
-Want me to get you one?
-Yeah.
"Yeah, great."
Yeah?
"All right, cool."
"It's Friday, so..."
Looking forward to it.
Yeah.
(JACKSON groaning)
I'm not supposed to tell anyone.
"Come on, anyone who ever says, ""I'm not supposed to tell anyone"""
"is always dying to tell someone, so tell me!"
-Why do you wanna know?
-I can't tell you that.
Then I'm not telling you.
But you are telling me that you could tell me something if you wanted to tell me?
Was that a question?
It felt like a question.
"Well, tell me if this feels like an answer."
No.
Jackson?
In here.
-ls something wrong?
What?
There's a new club at the pier that the Walkmen are playing at.
- You know who loves the Walkmen?
- You?
"- Yeah, and..."
- Summer.
- Summer is going out with Zach?
"Yeah, so maybe I'll buy her and Zach tickets to the show."
- Why would you do that?
- Out of friendship and to show her how selfless I can be.
- And to get her back.
- I'm going to look into this.
"- Seth, your coffee."
"- Oh, thanks a lot."
"I'll, uh, get you next time."
"- Oh, my God."
I am so sorry.
- That was refreshing.
"Uh, here, let me..."
- I... am so sorry.
Are you okay?
"- Yeah, I have to, uh, get a rhinoplasty, but now I'll look just like all the other girls here."
"It's okay, really."
"Uh, you can leave my tampons where they are."
Thanks.
Is there anything I can do?
"Uh, well, I guess you could dislocate my shoulder, or shave off my eyebrows."
"I mean, is this how you guys treat all your new students,or is today just my lucky day?"
- Can I buy you a coffee?
"- No, no, no, no."
"Please, please don't."
"I've had plenty, thanks, and I'm guessing you have, too."
That's great.
What are you going to do... break every lamp in the house?
No.
Take the bulbs out.
You need some light?
You creep.
- Just lay down!
- No!
Listen to me!
"You want to be raped... strangled, and drowned in a bath of your own blood?"
If you want to keep your ass alive... you're gonna have to help me.
You better be strong.
Strong like you?
Let go!
Don't test me.
Why did you come here?
You better get some sleep.
I don't want to sleep.
I got to go.
"Someday that dam you built's going to break, detective."
What you got there?
Soap.
It's from the hospital.
"Surgical, antibacterial."
"She saw him there last night, right?"
She smells the same weird soap.
So you're going to bring her in... for a detergical lineup... like some kind of goddamn commercial?
What the hell are you doing?
Anyone at the Byzantine churches recognize the drawing?
"Hallstrom, Crowe's on 501."
Joe.
Hallstrom.
Okay.
He's got a thing about... clowns.
That's okay.
Lots of people are afraid of clowns.
"Oh, no, no."
He's not afraid of them.
He likes them.
Like a fetish?
"[Sighs] Oh, good Lord."
I-I haven't verified it yet.
I still have to speak with one of his exes.
Okay.
"Keep me posted, will you?"
"Ryan, that is excellent."
Thank you.
"Now, just hold off on giving it to LAPD just until morning."
We have a plan to expose who's behind this.
[Sighs] Or get ourselves killed.
Having second thoughts?
About having a ménage with a trophy-taking serial killer?
No!
What could possibly go wrong?
"Look, this the murder weapon."
All you have to do is distract Austin long enough for me to find this knife.
Let's just hope we don't find it in one of our backs.
Right.
[Alarm beeping] Oh.
Castle:
Wow.
Ooh.
Sorry.
I was setting up a few counter-surveillance precautions.
"Hi, dreamboat."
I'm not talkin' to you.
Skeets.
(DOOR CLOSING)
"You want to see me, Aunt Nancy?"
"Well, yes, Willy."
I...
I wanted to have a little talk with you.
Uh-huh.
(CLEARING THROAT)
"I'm rather worried about you, Willy."
Did I do somethin' wrong?
"Oh, no, no."
I don't think so.
"Oh, no, I'm sure not."
"Well, I..."
"Uh, what I mean to say is, well, I don't think you know very much about girls, do you?"
I wouldn't want you to get into trouble.
What kind of trouble?
"It's difficult to explain, but..."
"Well, some people are born girls, and some people are born boys."
I'm glad.
It makes it so much nicer for dancing.
Yes.
"What I'm trying to say, Willy, is that girls are usually more mature than boys."
You have to be careful.
"Oh, you're talkin' about the birds and the bees."
I'm talking about you kissing Skeets in the park.
"Well, can you explain that?"
Not in one afternoon.
"Well, now, it's..."
It's perfectly all right for little girls and little boys to kiss.
- Luise?
Want a drink?
"- Yes, of course."
"Mark, stop it."
Stop.
- What are you doing?
- I feel like playing.
I am not in the mood.
If you fuck me the others will respect you again.
- What do you mean?
- You stopped talking to Vanessa.
When she had to move to Virum.
Just like you.
And where is she now?
Leave me alone.
Fuck off back to Virum.
POWER
"Power means being able to do what I want,   when I want, the way I want."
If something goes wrong like assault or other crime   our parents have the power and money to hush it up.
Nobody would dare say anything to me or tell me off.
Or tell me what to do.
Girls and boys look up to you and want to know you.
You can choose who you want to talk to.
Being in the group I'm in...
People know you are not...
I can provide all the stuff people dream of.
All the people who do ordinary 9 to 5 jobs   dream of living my kind of life.
I need something from my jacket.
The orange one.
This one?
"Hi, Hanne."
- We're leaving.
We pay these guys for that?
Okay.
"Now follow- Who is that, Marguerite?"
Follow Marguerite backwards until we see where she got that tray.
Keep going.
Keep going.
'Cause we want to see where that top chip in the far left column came from.
Okay.
Give me the casino angle.
Boom!
Let's see what we got on her.
"And while you're at it, give me Bella Petto, south deck about 11:00."
"Go tight on the topless chick near the middle, in the black bikini bottom."
"She's good, but about 1:30... got two blondes putting oil on each other."
Got it bookmarked.
"Mitch, this is business."
"Just a skosh more professionalism, if you don't mind."
See.
See.
"While you're getting your perv on, this guy's lifting this other dude's wallet."
Freeze it.
Blow it up.
Let's see what we got on him too.
"I'm in a surveillance zone, baby."
What?
I bet 50.
"Holding three clubs, aren't you?"
Fold.
When does the Pussycat Dolls go on?
Fold.
I'll see your 50.
Raise you a hundred.
"- [Knocking, Door Opening]"
"Oh, I'm sorry."
"Um, are you ready for us yet, Doctor?"
It's...
It's a little after 8:00.
"Zucco work back here, Mr. Morgan?"
When he's not out delivering.
"Hey, come on."
What's all this about?
What about shotgun shells?
Do you carry them?
"Well, years ago."
"Hey, maybe I still got a couple."
You want me to take a look?
"No, no, no."
"We have our man coming down from Explosive, and he'll check it out."
We'll just wait for him.
You mind if I look around down here?
"No, go ahead."
All right.
Thank you.
Here we go again.
So Samuels calls me in his office today.
You know what he wants?
He wants to know if I'm interested in a promotion.
"Well, that's great."
No!
"Now, wait a minute!"
You know what he really is interested in?
"- Well, not necessarily."
"- That's better than being totally ignored, isn't it?"
"[Neva Shouting] Your problems and my problems are so far apart, we can't even talk to each other."
"All right, then."
- (Knock) - (Parrot) Come in.
Shut up!
Come in.
(Parrot) Shut Up.
Come in.
"Oh, come in, everyone."
"I've brought Constable Wilson, m'lady."
He's going to perform the ceremony.
"Oh, good."
"Well, now, you stand over here."
That's right.
"Stokes, you're going to be best man."
You stand next to the groom.
"James, you're to give the bride away."
And Ethel and her mother will be the bridesmaids.
"We're the bridesmaids, Mother."
That'll be nice.
What am I?
The congregation.
Right.
"Go and fetch the bride, she's waiting on the landing."
"As soon as you hear the wedding march, come in."
"We don't want it to be too loud, so I've put in a soft needle and stuffed a pair of bloomers down the horn."
"That's the best thing to do, that is."
"This is ridiculous, Mr Twelvetrees."
Do we 'ave to do it?
"Yes, Ivy, we do."
His lordship gave strict instructions to humour Lady Lavender at all times.
Otherwise she might not leave him her money.
"Be quiet, Mabel, and hand me the parrot."
Haven't you got anything religious to put on?
- Bye.
Seven and I work at a production company
That cranks crappy reality shows.
Our job is to find and cast
"The quote, unquote talent."
Such as it is.
So just be natural and forget that the camera's even here.
Well I'm very comfortable in front of a camera.
So why don't you tell me how you and Burt met?
I'm sure that's a great story.
We met on the internet.
Now take these two.
"There here for a spot on the upcoming show ""Geezer Town."""
Some people will say or do just about anything to be on TV.
A blue pill a day makes your lady want to stay.
Oh yeah!
Hey Dale
Ohhh...
Seven
There's a call for you on line two.
Oh.
Really?
Um...
I will be back in just a second.
This is Dale Squire.
It's Becca
Can you come pick me up please?
"Yeah, what's wrong?"
"I'm on Doheny and Sunset, make a left."
"Ok, I'll be there in two seconds."
You don't want to leave this in there.
"That was Becca, she was crying."
How great would it have been to see this place in its heyday!
"Oh, I can't tell you how many times I've dreamed of that."
But one of these days we'll find a way to get it back on the map.
Yeah.
"Hey, listen, thanks for the drive."
I had a great time.
It's kinda nice to slow down every once in a while.
You're welcome.
"Hey, listen, listen!"
"If anybody asks you, we was out smashing' mailboxes, OK?"
Wha... what?
"Oh, man, the paint's still wet!"
"No, no, no, no!"
Get out of the store!
Hey!
Don't eat the radial!
"Here, take-a the snow tires."
- Mater!
- I wasn't tractor-tippin'!
Then where did all these gol-durn tractors come from?
"- Whoa, boy!"
- Hey!
"Hey, guys!"
There's one goin' this way.
I got it.
"Come here, little tractor, come here."
"Yeah, that's a good tractor."
"No, no, no, no, come here."
What are you doing?
You're not supposed to go wandering off all alone.
What are you doin' with those old racing' tires?
"Come on, Doc, drive."
It's a beautiful song.
Could you sing it again?
I only sing for one person.
Jeffrey?
Your singing is so filled with emotion.
I feel I already know him.
I wish he was here now.
"Wherever he may be, you are in his thoughts."
Part of him will always be here.
You no longer trust me?
You know why.
Ofcourse.
"In our profession, we shouldn't trust anyone."
How did they know about that beach?
They might have followed me... when I drove there.
That's my fault.
Who wants me dead?
Why do you ask?
You know the rules.
Why didn't you leave town after thejob?
I haven't got my money yet.
Who wants me dead?
"Ifyou hadn't exposed your identity, he wouldn't want you dead."
Answer me:
Who wants to kill me?
Answer me first:
Do you have any bullets left?
I always save the last bullet.
"Either for myself, or for my enemy."
"It'sJohnny Weng, Tony Weng's nephew."
He wants you dead.
He hired you to kill his uncle.
Slowly.
"No. no, no, no."
Did--did you see that--that guy
With the--with that--that gun?
It--it erases your short-term--no.
Psst.
What the hell is up with you two?
Now who are you working for?
Secret service.
"But a department that you, sir, know nothing about."
I doubt that.
Now what department?
"It's a, um, archival department."
You're filing clerks
Running around shooting stun guns
At your own people?
"Oh, we didn't shoot you."
"All right, filing clerks that protect us from invisible bad guys."
- Yeah.
Pretty much.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Pretty much.
I'll take it from here.
"Careful, archives."
"Paper cuts, they take days to heal."
That's hilar-- you're hilarious.
Very scared.
- So glad to see you.
- Thank you.
Not a damn word.
"Now, I warned you to back off before things got worse."
Already did.
I told you to stay away from them and I meant it.
"Now, go on, get him out of here."
I don't know what to say.
There's nothing to say.
"You came to me for help, right?"
"It may not have turned out the way either of us wanted it to, but... it's how it turned out and it's all right."
I do... and besides...
I got to imagine myself being a daddy.
(chuckles)
I like how it feels.
Thank you.
Thank you.
(kisses)
Bye-bye.
"== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man"
Man:
Why did they stay at a BB?
Woman:
It was a nice BB.
I thought the mission was that he had to get to Fort Lauderdale to get his job back in a blaze of glory.
"Yeah, but the wife didn't know that."
She likes BBs.
It was a really nice BB.
What kind of people would stay at a place run by a pedophile?
Plot twist... they didn't know that.
That Russian girl was 16.
"Yeah, but they assumed that the old guy was interested in the mom."
Are you almost done with him?
I want my turn.
Yeah.
- I have you.
- What?
!
What do you have?
You have what I have...
nothing!
"You, my boy, were in Mom and Dad's bed."
"Oh, ho-ho-ho."
"What was that, the sound of power suddenly shifting?"
Nothing happened.
"Yeah, and it didn't happen in Mom and Dad's bed."
I have you.
I have you by your ovaries.
"Hey, Cor, buddy, I'm not gonna kill you."
That was one of those wacky brother-to-brother murder threats.
Yeah.
"Listen, I'd like you to do something for me."
- Anything you need.
- Tell me how you do it.
What I was doing with Rebecca?
"No, no, what you were doing with Rebecca, I don't have the lung capacity for that."
"I just wanna know, how do you get a girl to say hi?"
"- Oh, you're wasting my time."
- I have you.
"Now, ordinarily I wouldn't reveal my foolproof method, but I know I can count on my favorite little brother to keep a secret."
I'm listening.
"- OK, you got eyes?"
- Yeah.
- Use 'em.
- How?
Look at her.
Look into her.
Or else one day your scream will kill me.
Look..
"look brother, my heart is beating so fast."
"Forgive me, Airport my friend, but.."
"No brother, today I will have to.."
..tell you what your problem is.
Why do you have such dreams?
What else ajobIess person do otherthan have dreams?
till my dreams dont come true these..
..dreams will keep on following me.
Oh this means I will have to get you ajob.
"Come brother, I will talk to my producer about you today."
And get you ajob of spot boy.
Which hero is shooting over here?
"Hey forget about the hero, the producer and.."
..director Mr. N. Chandra is coming.
-Okay.
call him sir and fall on his feet.
But why should I call him sir?
Because this is how you greet here!
Come on!
-Sir!
What is it?
"-Sir, that.. he is Krishna."
"He is a very hard working boy, sir."
He wants a spot boysjob.
"Its a small thing, keep him."
Why do you need to ask me?
"You have done me a huge favour, sir."
Sir..
- He gave me a house to stay.
I had my clothes with me and you..
"Thank you for coming, everybody."
I'm gonna kill you.
I'm sorry.
It's not every day my boss is chosen to be in a magazine.
Is he a good kisser?
"- Oh, my God."
Where's my dad?
"- Oh, he's running a little late."
"Would it be horrible if you just went and, uh, hung out in the kitchen for a little while?"
Then I can distract my dad somehow and...
"Alex, I got to tell you-- hiding's really not my thing."
"Could it be your thing for, like, five minutes?"
"All right, but I'm making a sandwich, I'm not cleaning up."
"Oh, excuse me, everyone, everyone."
"Um, my dad doesn't know about me and Scott, so let's not tell him, okay?"
Not that there's anything to hide.
"It was, like, one motorcycle ride."
It's always the motorcycle guys.
"Hey, honey."
"Oh, the traffic."
"Yeah, what are you gonna do?"
Hummus?
I wanted to see the look on your face.
Stephen... did you get it on tape?
"Dad, Dad-- you don't need to see the tape."
Here's how it went.
Surprise!
"Oh, my God."
This is so sweet.
"Ooh, hummus."
Was that cute or what?
Let's take a look at the tape.
This high council is adjourned.
[âª]
Mace?
Follow da veiga.
Tap into his tracer frequency.
He'll see the power spike.
It will be too late.
"Thanks, karen."
I'm not surprised you can't find
Any information on the scabbard.
"Well, I still have a few more"
People to hear back from.
Do you want me to wait?
No.
It seems we've stirred up
The hornet's nest here.
"I need you to pack up,"
Get out of there
And just keep your phone on.
You don't have to ask me twice.
"Okay, thanks, kate."
"No, interpol have no information"
On the scabbard either.
Looks like we've reached a dead end.
What about your father's house?
"Yes, it's possible"
He already has the scabbard.
You don't mean go there?
We'd be sitting ducks.
I know the combination to his safe.
Great.
And I think I can get us past the alarms.
Lieutenant caine.
The beatles played on this stage.
I know that.
I was here.
You come alone?
Just like I said I would.
Why here?
I like my privacy.
"What's this all about, caine?"
Where'd you get this photo?
You let jesse cardoza take the fall for something you did.
"What exactly do you want, caine?"
I want you to come clean.
All right.
We knew enright had murdered his wife.
"And we had him, too."
Dead to rights.
"When I saw that cuff link,"
"I knew that his slick lawyers would get him off,"
So I pocketed it.
"No harm, no foul."
The right guy goes down.
And that's the way it should be.
But I had no idea
Cardoza had already taken a photograph of it.
So you allowed it to look like he tampered with evidence.
I figured he was young.
Get a couple weeks
"Desk duty, slap on the wrist."
"Yes, but it didn't turn out that way, did it?"
No.
His wife was murdered- probably by enright.
"I'm the house, you're the player."
"I believe the word is ""sucker. """
Okay.
"I've got a nine up, and you've got a five and a six for 11."
Do you want a card?
I want to double down.
"KITT, that's doubling your bet and you only get one card."
You sure you wanna do that?
Is the house in the habit of advising the player?
Your money.
I believe that's 21.
"Thank you, michael."
"They call that ""beginner's luck,"" pal."
"As I understand it, the phrase is,"
"""shut up and deal. """
"Hold on to your horses, hotshot, we've got Devon on the line."
"Hello, Devon!"
"Hello, michael."
I'm glad to see that you're getting into the spirit of things.
"Yeah, I'm already $2 behind."
What's up?
"Uh, there's, uh, someone I want you to check out for me since you're going through Las Vegas, anyway."
"Her name is, um, Rita Wilcox."
She works at Caesars Palace.
"Okay, what are we looking for?"
I'm not sure.
She tells a provocative but fantastic story about a missing brother.
All right.
I'll see what she has to say.
"With any luck, we should be pulling in to Vegas about 10:00, 10:30 tonight."
See you later.
Right.
It takes a lot more than this rain... to wash away their sins.
Be sexy in the rain!
Thank God!
Aleluia!
Aleluia!
You know what we need?
- The lightning machine.
- Lightning!
Lightning machine?
Let's get out of here.
"Maybe we should stick around, get lost then start to move faster!"
I'm freezing.
Call me a cube.
"This is unbeareable, cube."
"I can't believe they're making rain... for the photo shoot with, water from the Hudson river!"
They're crazy!
We're all gonna get typhoid-d!
"Listen, we gotta take off these clothes."
We don't wanna get pneumonia.
Do you think they'd mind if I wore something from the wardrobe?
No!
Go for it.
It's too jay.
"These things are supposed to be worn, not framed."
- I'm swimming in it!
- Hang on.
Where's your head?
Hang on.
"That's it, that's it."
There you go.
What's that?
Hang on!
"Let me talk to Pete, okay?"
"Oh, Pete got fired this morning."
That's so weird that you don't know that.
Jack Donaghy thinks he's gonna come into my house and mess with my show?
Hell no.
Jenna and I worked for years to get this show.
"You know, I moved from Chicago for this."
From Chicago?
I was in Scottie Pippen's wedding.
Now Donaghy is trying to steal it from us.
"He already fired Pete, who is a great producer."
He fired Pete?
He can't fire Pete.
"You know what, I quit."
He can suck it.
Mm-hmm.
"Yeah, suck it, Pete."
"No, you're not listening."
You're not a good listener.
20 minutes to air.
But Liz said we were cutting the cat lady sketch.
She said it stinks.
Ouch.
This is why Liz is wrong.
Animal humour is universal.
I just don't think that I'm good in it.
Do you think I'm good in it?
I think this is your opportunity to go out there and prove everybody wrong.
What--what do you mean?
Who's everybody?
"The network that wanted to fire you, the focus groups that said you had a weird eye--"
You mean this eye?
"- Me, too."
- Good!
So that's the end of it.
"A few weeks ago, the beast was circling the village."
Farm animals and pets were going missing.
I tracked it to this area.
It's between two farms.
Prime hunting ground.
Good job.
Anything I can do to help?
Yeah.
See that tree over there?
Yeah.
Go and stand under it and leave me alone.
- What?
- Just trying to imagine what you were like when you were my age.
You must have worn a lot of black.
Here.
Don't break anything.
"So, what's the deal with you and Kyle?"
"He needed someone to put him on camera,"
I needed an extra-ordinary graduation film to kick-start my career.
We sort of found each other.
- So you two are...?
- For a bit.
Then Kyle...
"Well, I mean he decided that work was..."
"Great, let's share life stories while my camera battery drains."
"Kyle, your public's waiting."
"So, Kyle, tell us what's going on."
This is Shannon Kelly.
Hi.
"I mean, you should be angry, too."
Look what they did to you and what's-his-name--Charlie.
Look at that!
"I mean, how can you sit here and let that kind of thing go unanswered?"
"Come on, we don't need to talk about that."
"What, we're not supposed to tell Allie she's a test-tube baby?"
You sorry bastard.
Hey...
Charlie's hurt.
Yeah.
Is he going to be all right?
"I don't know, honey."
If Ray will let us get him to the hospital...
No one's going anywhere until I get what I want.
( knock on door )
GUARD:
Campus security.
Dr Penzler?
We had a report of a gunshot.
Hands up.
Get your hands up.
"Yeah, you keep 'em up there."
Okay.
Here's the situation.
"I'm holding these people hostage, all right?"
I've already shot one of them.
I'm angry and unpredictable.
Look at me!
"What we're doing here, we're waiting for the FBI."
There's two more security officers coming from other parts of the campus.
"Yeah, so?"
What do you want me to do about them?
"I don't know, but young Toad Face there seems to be leader."
Get them all out of here.
"Come on, get out of here."
On your feet.
Hold them there.
"Naik, detail eight men for escort duty."
Bring them here on the double.
"Listen, you."
What became of Burgess sahib?
"- Come on, spit it out."
"- He can speak, but he won't."
- He doesn't know.
- Here.
"You never saw one of these things before, did you?"
"It's for growing daisies, isn't it?"
- Or for planting lilies for people's graves.
"- No, sahib."
What became of these people here?
- He doesn't know.
- That's good.
We'll take them back with us and let the Colonel put them through the mangle.
No.
Will not go with the white sahib.
You will never leave here.
Already your graves are dug.
"By nightfall, Ma Kali will be smiling."
Never mind the second chorus.
Come on.
"Party, form a square!"
"Under cover, everybody!"
Get in there!
Take cover in the courtyard.
The dog... just Greta.
She was in the bathroom.
"Well, what was she doing?"
That's the funny thing.
She was pulling the curling iron out of the water by the cord.
"Boy, that's some smart dog."
Maybe she heard the girl scream when the curler hit the water.
I guess that's what happened.
"God, I don't know."
[Siren wailing]
There's something more.
What?
How did the dog get in?
"She was locked out, I'm sure."
"Well, maybe... maybe the girl let her in."
No.
She was in the tub.
I remember Monique slumped down under the water.
Eyes were still open.
Oh?
"Well, she's propped up against the end of the tub now."
"Well, I pulled her up from under the water."
"I was hoping she was still breathing, but she wasn't."
But who is she?
What was she doing here?
"Monique Berger, a friend."
She lives across the street.
They're working on the plumbing system.
[Siren wailing]
Anything else I should do?
"No, just stay in there and see they"
Don't make a mess of things.
"Zhu Li, come on!"
We got guests.
Whip up a pot of that green tea I love.
"Yes, sir."
Zhu Li's in prison with you?
Of course.
I don't go anywhere without my assistant.
Do you?
"We're not interested in your tea, and this isn't a friendly visit."
Don't tell me you guys are still mad about everything that happened.
I did some good things too.
"Korra, who warned you about Unalaq?"
I did.
"Bolin, who got you into the movers?"
I did.
"Asami, who saved your company?"
I did.
"Mako, who got you thrown in jail?"
I did!
"Oh, yeah, I guess that was a bad thing."
"You stole everything from me, and you tried to kidnap the president."
Those are pretty bad too.
I wasn't going to hurt him.
I just needed to start a war.
"Well, a bigger war."
"Well, we're gonna end it."
Where's all the stuff you stole from Asami?
The future industries stuff?
It's on my battleship.
You have a battleship?
Of course I do!
"I bought the first one they made, named her the Zhu Li."
"Say, you in the blue serge suit!"
You look like a man with sporting blood flowing in your veins!
Would you like to see the forbidden quarter of Algiers?
"Gather around closer, please!"
I've a little item to show you!
This is called the ever-writing ballpoint pen!
Sells for $ 15 in the leading stores!
"Back up a little, please, you bother me!"
You can write as easy with your left hand as your right!
It doesn't make a difference!
You geeked it!
And I had a buck on you!
You're yellow!
You should've taken that with you!
- Maybe you could've hit him with it!
- Leave him alone!
"He don't mean nothing, Tony!"
I don't mind!
A fight's only a fight!
- I still got that million-to-one shot!
"- Okay, boys!"
Main event on!
"- Get ready, main event!"
- Luth!
Intermission's about over!
"Hey, Mickey!"
Give Stoker a hand with his bandages!
Main event in the ring!
I wish I had the champ in there tonight!
"I know I'm right, Gus!"
"Tell you, I can feel it!"
"- Okay, boy!"
"Yeah, yeah."
Hannah's response:
"""Nobody's perfect,"
"But this guy's a super, super jerk""."
Oh man.
My mom watches Leno.
Well if it makes you feel any better.
"Both Miley and Hannah love their ""super, super jerk""."
Well I'm glad you think this is funny.
But you're not the one who's a talk show punch line?
You're a cute punch line.
"Oh Jesse, come on!"
Oh come on Jesse.
I know it's my fault but...
"Okay this is where you say ""No it's not your fault honey."
"We're in this together""."
Let me try it again.
Jesse I know it's my fault but...
Your turn.
"Doesn't have to be ""honey""."
"Could be ""lamb chop cupcake..."""
Miley.
Oh come on.
You can do better than that.
You don't get it.
"Everybody in America knows me as the super, super jerk."
Who broke Hannah Montana's heart?
Everybody?
"Now come on, you're being a little dramatic."
I mean the people that know you and love you don't feel that way.
[Cell phone buzzing]
Really?
Get that?
!
One of us!
"I don't get it. I'm stupid to get it Mr. Writer, sir."
"I say be an ordinary plumber, but you, you're a raving lunatic!"
That woman is deadly!
"Three husbands, three dead bodies!"
"One of us will be the fourth, can't you see that?"
Deadly?
You just want to scare me so I'll split!
So you'll have Chrissy for yourself and all her money!
Forget it!
"You can't rattle this boy, this boy's staying with Chrissy!"
- You stay and you're dead!
- Bullshit!
One of us will croak!
Scram!
Fine!
I'll read the headlines about your death!
Raving lunatic!
- Get in!
- No!
I'm leaving for Amsterdam!
Get in and I'll take you to the station.
Just don't take me anywhere near that woman.
Okay.
She's mine then.
- Can't you pass them?
- Grouch!
"You're driving beside your own funeral, Herman."
Watoh out!
"First him, doctor, first look at him."
"Guys, I know."
We work in a firehouse.
I know everything you guys know.
"All right, and believe me, I say this as a dad."
"You know, no dad could be prouder to find out that his daughter is terrible in bed."
- Right.
- That's right.
- Yeah.
"- You know what, to colleen."
"May she continue to make tommy's life miserable for many, many, many more years to come."
"Here, here."
"Mike, do me a favor.Call shawn in the morning, will you, find out what's going on."
Ok.
"Holy shit, guys."
Another 8 grandioso.
"- Oh, yeah."
- Really?
Awesome.
Nice.
"You know, we gotta give some of this to charity, don't you think?"
"Yeah, that's a good idea."
"That's a good idea, right?"
"Hey, charity."
Yeah.
"Yeah, let's not do that."
That sucks.
What's wrong with you?
"You know, guys, my mother made all this possible."
"You know, maybe we should give it to like a cancer charity or something."
"Yeah.Yeah, that is a really good idea, actually."
"Well, wait a second, shitbird."
I thought you said we we weren't doing it.
And entered your hot and wet vagina.
Your cherished sexy lips of ardent lust and desire.
And so flush in the springtime of your passion.
Can you feel my cock as your clitoris between your fingers?
"Every stroke of yours, it gets bigger and harder."
"Feel it, love, are you coming?"
"Respond, Rosella, tell me that you can feel it."
"Yes, I am sorry!"
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
Slowly!
Gently!
I can't take any more.
No!
Come slowly too.
"Gently, slowly."
What dominating fingers you have!
It makes me crazy.
"Yes, like that, penetrate my yoni, please."
I love you deep iside.
"Take my bushy cunt, I beg you."
Don't stop.
More cock inside.
Stronger please.
Take it.
"Push it, we are getting there, forcefully."
"Yes, that's good."
We are coming together.
"Yes, that's it!"
"More, keep it going!"
"Squeeze my balls, my darling."
That feels so good!
OK.
Bye.
Is that my phone?
Is it Charles?
"It was Charles, wasn't it?"
Yes!
Yes.
Oh!
What?
I was...
Really looking forward to that call.
Aren't you going to Amaar's press conference?
No.
Like they're waiting for me.
"Ah, how long do you think we have to wait for the mayor?"
We should just go ahead and get this thing started.
Oh!
"Remember, you are doing something amazing for the community, and you're going to be great!"
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Don't bring up the chicken.
"Good evening, residents of Mercy."
"Tonight, I stand before you, a man of faith, a man with a vision!"
A man with a purpose.
A man who is going to build a mosque in Mercy!
"It'll be our own mosque,"
No different than the mosque that we have in the church.
"If it's no different, then why do you need to build it?"
"Well, I had a vision."
That's how it all started.
"Well, not really a vision, more like a sign!"
- I hope he does.
I hope my guy does.
Is that... is that the guy you're supposed to meet?
"- No, maybe that's yours."
"- No, I don't think so."
Are you Richard?
- How you doing?
"- Hey, Richard."
I'm Nathaniel.
"- Yeah, I figured it'd be you."
- Nice to meet you.
Right.
Right.
"There was a policeman here and a policeman here,"
- and the dead man was here.
- And where were you?
I'm pretty sure that I was over here.
"So when you came in, were the policemen already there?"
"No, no."
"I see this face of this guy, and he didn't look very well."
Did you know he was dying?
Was it clear to you that...
I've never seen anybody die.
So I don't think I would know that.
"I've seen one or two dead men, and they don't look like that."
They look very peaceful.
- He didn't look peaceful?
- No.
"You remember that, that he didn't look peaceful?"
What was... what was the...
I mean...
He just didn't.
We need to talk to the Civil Guard.
Have them step up surveillance at the Point.
We have to find whoever owns that heroin.
I'll take the river.
I'll take Quini.
HUNTING LODGE FOR RENT
Yes.
"Okay, thanks a lot."
Marina's at her house.
Her mother says she's fine.
The Civil Guard is mixed up in all of this.
Someone's tipping them off.
The whole town smokes American tobacco and there's not a single butt on any of the boats.
They have to get by on something between harvests.
Go in.
Sit there.
- I'm fine standing.
"- Sit, damn it."
What were you doing at the hunting lodge earlier?
I was with my girlfriend.
Wanna hear the details?
"Yes, I do."
Nobody ever explained it to you?
- Who's the man in the hat?
- What man?
"The guy who went in after you, before I got my head bashed in."
Nobody came in.
"I told you, we were alone."
"You want my blood, is that it?"
"Call the doctor, I'll wait."
Too bad you didn't bring your pajamas.
You're sleeping here.
- I'm Justin.
- Ding dong.
- Felix's brother.
- Hi.
Sorry about the mud.
"- Hi, I'm Gemma."
- Nice to meet you.
I'm Chris.
"All right, mate."
"Right, um..."
"To explain, there's been a bit of a cock-up."
"Uh, Felix was due back yesterday, but he ended up getting stuck abroad."
"- In Chile, of all places."
- Chile?
"Y-Yes, I know, it's bizarre."
"Uh, he's been volunteering on a hospital project, having a fantastic time, by all accounts"
"The birthday bash was meant to be a surprise, and... well, then, his flight got cancelled."
"I've been ringing around putting people off, but I haven't done a very good job of it evidently."
"So, there's no party?"
I'm really sorry.
"But look, there-there's plenty to drink, plenty to eat, um, places to crash."
"Youre more than welcome to hang out here tonight, in fact I hope that you will."
I know that Felix would approve.
"Come on, uh, let's do this."
"Uh, Luke, it is, uh, Luke, right?"
"Yeah, that's right."
Grand.
"Grab six glasses, my friend."
I'm cracking open the bubbly.
"Let's have a party, then."
- He is horny.
- He's okay.
They were tied with bows.
"I tried to grab on to them, but they kept popping away."
And then I started to sink... like a stone.
There was nothing I could do.
I was falling.
But it felt good.
I was letting go.
I was letting myself go... and... all I could see... was black... and all I could feel was the darkness above me... and the lights... coming from below.
I knew I was dying.
"And then I heard this voice, like somebody whispering in my ear."
"""Wake up, number 37""."
And then I woke up.
What do you think that means?
Number 37?
I have absolutely no idea.
I met him.
The guy who told me about the plane crash.
You met him?
Yeah.
I met him.
"Last night, coming home from work about midnight."
I'm driving past the cement plant... out bythe chemical factory.
Right.
Something happened.
Bright... flash.
Lightning.
Something... encircles me.
Everything's kind ofhot.
I feel like I can't catch... catch my breath.
He looked human.
But there was just something... wrong about him.
That's when I heard the voice.
I know my way around.
"We're not committing to an offer yet, but if you have a number, we'll listen."
"Mr. Canning, are you with us?"
"Oh, I'm sorry, I was just texting my lawyer."
"It's funny, isn't it, lawyers having lawyers?"
"And my lawyer probably has a lawyer, too."
"We should all be getting progressively smaller, like matryoshka dolls."
Yes.
"So are we negotiating,"
- or what are we doing?
"- No, we're negotiating."
I-I think I have an offer for you.
A one-time offer.
- Zero?
Really?
"- Yeah, unfortunately you have five minutes to decide whether to take it."
I see.
"And if we don't, you have a bomb or something?"
Sort of.
Hi.
We're all here.
Where are you?
Just changing.
I'll be right in.
"The rash is back, Michael."
I know.
I'm trying the ointment three times a day.
You have to stop eating so much spicy food.
Yes.
No more Thai food for you.
"Oh, please, it's just poop."
"You shovel the stuff all day, buddy."
Lieutenant?
"Aw, holy shit."
Yeah.
I'll be right there.
There's been another murder.
Milwaukee.
Why don't you just come in here and sit?
How long was this one dead before they found her?
What's she doing here?
Not even an hour.
The husband came home with the kids.
"Would you come with me, please?"
- What?
- Come on.
What's going on with this girl?
I happen to like her.
Is it any of your business?
"Yeah, it's my business because it's my ass."
Mitchell's talking about... putting another team on the case.
Mitchell's what?
Who the hell's he going to put on this case... that's not already working on it?
"I mean, we followed every goddamn lead."
We got enough evidence to put the guy away for life.
We've got one fucking problem... we have no idea who did it.
And she is the only one that saw that killer.
That's why I keep coming back to her.
"I'm telling you, she's the key."
To the case or to you?
Ridge...
I bought her flowers.
I bought her fucking flowers.
Me.
"Seigaku regular, second year student, Kaidou Kaoru."
You'd better not regret.
You will lose.
What did you say.
Well he looks quite cute.
He's really good!
"You alright, senpai?"
Such beautiful spinning ball...
It's my first time seeing something like that.
"Hey, hey, hey, ah Kaidou?"
Who's he playing with?
That must be the transfer student Ryuzaki-sensei was talking about.
"Heh, you can even spin the ball into such an angle."
Snake shot.
Game Kaidou.
One love.
Court change.
So it'll be like this.
"If it continues like this, he will..."
My reaction is getting slower.
I can't be losing to this chibi?
This is a match of perseverance.
I won't lose.
Heh...
This person even knows the Snake.
"That is a Buggy Whip shot, right."
It's quite difficult to use since this is my first time trying it.
First time?
"Senpai, you sure are sweating a lot."
You'll wet that uniform.
The weather's so hot yet you're dressed so weirdly.
It's not over.
Rats!
Rats!
We gotta get rid of the rats
Rats!

Understood.
Male and I are going to be the distraction.
We will do it on three.
When the EMP hit it... it will shut down.
"Male, you'll destroy the TL."
We can't take back the warhead under this circumstances.
"In that case, to destroy it is our mission."
Ok?
Let's go... 1... 2... 3...
Male!
Are you ok?
Male?
Male!
It was done?
No...
Just...
Destroy the TL immediately!
"If you lock the fuse like that, the booster will burn it down."
You are going to roast a warhead.
Yes.
Jin here.
I'm going to disable the GUNK's launcher.
"Please, destroy the main weapon from there."
"Male here, entered in the TL."
I'll report back when the launcher preparation is ready.
Hurry up Male!
"If the GUNK recovers mobility, it will start blasting immediately."
Gimlet!
"Before that, please, destroy the main gun!"
"Sorry, was in trouble."
I'm in a blind spot here.
Let me see if I can do something...
Me too.
If you can go slightly backward shake it to pass.
"That I can not befriend, retreat."
Running the beach not up to anyone.
Maybe move to the other side.
Do not have this side.
-And what have we got here.
Then they will have to return everything.
I am with children it's kind of dangerous.
I know.
-And we need to get home.
"I understand, very fair."
"But understand my side, champion."
One day I will have to protect my thing.
Because someone will want to take it from me.
"When I see, the whole world will see."
And in the background of consciousness I have a cruel reminder.
Once I stepped for a penguin.
"He looked at me, is gone."
"Goodbye, girls, hello empty beach."
-Got it.
"Yes, more ..."
So get out my face!
My mother says that every obstacle is an opportunity.
What?
"Dude, can apologize, or I'll break your nose!"
-He did not want to do this.
-All right.
And I still know.
"- ""SvenPense."""
"-Erik, no."
"His chubby flabby, out of my way."
-I'm miserable.
I'm so hungry the only thing that got me through the last 20 miles.
Was thinking about shoveling in.
That big old bowl of mac and cheese and bacon.
She normally doesn't eat it.
You ate it all?
"Yes, but he dropped some on the floor and I threw it in the trash."
-But it's right on top so...
-Uh...
I ate that too.
This is the worst day ever.
I lost my Jesse and now I'm gonna be stuck.
At Malibu Community College without you.
And the only reason I'm going to get any mac and cheese and bacon.
Is if dad regurgitates it like a mama robin.
Hey darling don't worry.
I'm gonna fix this.
How about I make you a nice omelet?
What would you like in it?
My Jesse and an acceptance letter to Stanford.
And maybe some chives and salted mushrooms.
Coming right up.
-Miley?
-What?
Look you're not gonna go to Malibu Community College alone.
[Sobbing] You're right.
I'll be with Jackson!
"No, no."
You're not gonna be with Jackson.
You're gonna be with me.
What?
"Yeah, I mean, if you can't go to Stanford until next year."
- That was a cheap shot.
- What are you...
"You know, excuses are like assholes."
"Everybody's got one, and they all stink."
"- Oh, yeah?"
You wanna go at it right now?
"- Whoa, whoa, whoa."
You wanna settle this now?
Let's do it right here.
Let's settle this son of a bitch right here.
"Hey, hey."
Take it easy here.
Jesus.
"Show a little class, will ya?"
Geez.
"Look, I'm an old man."
I don't fight no more.
I let my daughter do my fighting for me.
"And maybe in a couple years, when this little graham cracker... might have the stuff to compete, maybe we'll see."
Wait.
"You know what, asshole?"
Why don't you go to hell?
"- Dee, stay out of this."
- No.
This guy has been all over us since we walked in.
"I tell you what, jerk."
Why don't you take you big mouth... and go someplace else with it?
"Listen, little buttercup, I'm just bustin' your old man's balls."
- You don't have to get your panties in an uproar.
"- Oh, my God."
Are you standing there?
"Come on, move."
All outbound buses were told to stand down.
And you don't know when we're gonna be allowed to stand up again?
"Soon, I hope."
I hate missing dinner.
Yeah.
"Me, too."
There's our little graduate.
"My God, look at that gown."
You look just like the Statue of Liberty.
- All big and stony?
- No.
You look amazing.
You look very GQ.
Thanks to my best new friend Ermenegildo Zegna.
Don't you love how he can pronounce it now?
Very cosmopolitan.
He got it for the rehearsal dinner.
It's his first real suit.
And not my last.
I look hot.
"You know that Emily's out there, right?"
Why?
- It's a long story.
Just do me a favor.
- Sure.
Keep an eye on my parents.
Make sure they don't disrupt anything.
My mother doesn't behead anyone.
My father doesn't snore too loudly.
- They won't do anything like that.
- Haven't you met them?
- Why would they do that?
I want you to take the gown out of your bag and put it on.
-This isn't appropriate for public.
-You don't understand naked.
Naked is inner.
I am here with you.
There is no shame.
There is no separation.
And I'm not ill.
"Yes, you are ill, Gloria."
And I have no need for a green synthetic nightie used to conceal the essence of my supple skin and my aching soul in the barren desert that is this land.
I'm moving in with my son in Costa Mesa.
He thinks I'm lonely.
"Truth is, he's lonely."
Sweet kid.
Just can't seem to connect.
Me and my wife lived here 40 years.
"It's lovely, really."
It's really lovely.
You seem like a very nice person.
I hope you take the place.
-Come on.
-Come on!
You're nothing!
Come on!
Pussy!
Fucking pussy!
I don't know about trust.
Maybe she just needed a nap or something.
Believe me.
She's been belligerent with everybody else.
I dealt with her last year.
"I just listened to her, really."
"You didn't have a choice, Philip."
This is war.
You think they would've done anything less to us?
- Reagan --
- I don't need the speech.
I know it's war.
This is easier for you.
"You think it's easy for me, what I do?"
The FBI called me this morning.
They want to meet with me tomorrow afternoon.
"Well, could this be a routine security check?"
No one goes to D.C. for a routine security check.
Do you know if anyone else was called?
Everyone who was at the meeting in Alexandria.
"I could postpone the meeting, find out what they asked the other folks before going in there."
No.
No.
That would be suspicious.
All right.
"I'll just go in, then."
"Look, you don't have to worry about me."
I'll be fine.
Paul...
Emmett.
Emmett taught me how to handle this situation.
"Yeah, he was -- he was one of the best."
"Yes, he was."
"I miss him, too."
But we're working together now.
And you need to trust me.
You give me orders.
I'll follow them.
We are going nowhere.
"Until we've got fingers again, obviously."
Great!
You've done a really good job.
It's very... secure.
Thanks.
"And don't worry, it unlocks just as easily as it locks."
"Oh, no."
Ah...
Kidding.
I'm kidding.
I was just...
- Thanks.
- Hi.
- He doesn't say much.
- That's Steve.
He takes a while to warm up to new people.
"So, who are you exactly?"
I'm you.
I thought you looked familiar.
"12 years ago, I was the kid no-one believed."
I'm...
I saw something too.
"An animal, a creature, really."
"I was walking where I'd walked 100 times before and for some reason that day, there it was."
I've never seen anything like it before or since.
You never saw it again?
But I knew what I'd seen.
"For a while, I tried to convince other people I'd seen it, too."
I don't need to tell you how that went.
My parents practically measured me for my own strait jacket.
I know how it feels when the people you rely on most don't believe you.
And you won't be going anywhere.
We'll see about the television.
All right?
"I'm very pleased that you like Dr. Travers, darling."
I did too.
"Well, he said he'd stop by in a couple of days to see how I'm feeling."
Good.
"And I will tell you exactly what he's going to say, that your husband is taking very good care of you."
I'll be right back.
- What did you do?
- Oh.
The antibiotics Dr. Travers gave me.
Let me help you.
He should've given me clumsy pills instead.
Better take this before I forget.
"- Gerard, I'll be coming down for breakfast at 7:15 tomorrow morning."
Tell Mrs. Gunnerson it will be the usual.
That's right.
Thank you.
Good night.
"Oh, here, darling."
"Oh, thank you."
To my beautiful wife.
Alexis.
"It's late, very late."
There's nothing more that you can do tonight.
Let's go home.
"I want to stay here, Dex."
You're tired.
You can come back tomorrow.
"Yes, I know, but I want to stay and talk to Galen's doctors."
Even if it means spending the night?
"No, you haven't struck a nerve."
"Oh, for God's sakes, Adam, I knew the man briefly."
Is that it?
Or is it because it's me asking?
It's obvious Blake's told you he's disinherited me.
I assume he's also turned you against me.
"Adam, darling, it has nothing to do with you."
I did know Garrett Boydston a long time ago.
That part of my life is over.
That book is closed.
And I never re-read an old book.
Sorry.
Mary had a little lamb
"Little lamb, little lamb"
Mary had a little lamb...
Claudia.
What are you doing here?
"We're having fun, Mommy."
"- It's true, Sammy Jo."
I was just in the neighbourhood.
And I thought I'd stop by and see a little boy that I love very much.
"Oh, do you now?"
"Well, don't try and get too close to my son, you hear?"
"Danny, go see Marie and go play downstairs for a while."
But you'll come back again.
- Promise?
"- Oh, I promise."
"The fact is, Sammy Jo, that we're already close."
We got that way when I was married to Steven.
- While you were-
- I was what?
Too busy bumming around to take care of your own baby.
Okay.
It's...
Order an abdominal M.R.I. and a urine catecholamine.
It's just a hunch.
Okay.
Oh.
I almost killed you with an educational rattle.
Sorry.
I didn't knock in case you were sleeping.
I just came to get Cooper's clothes.
"Yeah, and to check up on me, make sure I'm not crazy."
I know the drill.
"What, you want to hold the baby?"
Do I look like someone who wants to hold a baby?
I'm wearing silk.
Are you breast-feeding?
No.
"No, I'm not."
"You know, a lot of women don't breast-feed."
I don't need to breast-feed.
L...
like I should feel bad about it?
I...
"I am so sick of people trying to make me feel like what I feel isn't what I should feel, if that makes any sense."
No.
"No, Charlotte, I'm not breast-feeding, okay?"
What you do with your boobs is your business.
"I only ask because you look like you need a martini, and if you're not breast-feeding, you can have a martini."
You want a martini?
Yeah.
Please.
Naomi.
"You know, i..."
I wasjust feeling good that day.
Yeah.
"I, uh..."
I don't know what to say.
"I'm at a loss, boy."
I'm at a total loss.
"I mean, here you are, supposedly injured, all right?"
You're collecting your lieutenant's salary and full disability.
I didn't even want to do this.
Matt had to talk me into it.
You know how stupid I felt?
"The lower back, it's an enigma."
"Pat, I'm gonna be straight with you."
"Obviously I have alternatives to pursue, but I'm not gonna... because - cause I don't want this getting out."
All right?
It makes everybody look bad.
"But from now on, you are back on full patrol."
Here.
Get started with this.
- A missing person's case?
"- Yeah, a bookie."
Jerry Green.
No one's seen him for about a week.
Huh.
Jeez.
- What happened to him?
"- I don't know, Pat."
That's what you're supposed to find out.
Right.
All right.
We talked earlier about the fact there's a shortage of wading pools.
I want you out of here.
"And from now on, I don't want anybody going to his tavern,"
I don't want anybody eating his food.
"Spit that out, Johnson."
"I brought this from home, sir."
I said spit it out.
I think he meant into a napkin.
- I'm going to go.
- Good.
And take these lousy sandwiches with you.
"Those are my gym clothes, sir."
I'm really glad we could have dinner.
"Me, too."
You okay?
You seem a little nervous.
"No,"
I'm not nervous.
Just a little hopped up from the pepper shrimp.
"Alex, I get it."
You're afraid someone will see us together and tell your father.
I'm not afraid.
It's just there's nothing to tell him.
Okay.
"But I can tell my friends about you, right?"
Tell them what exactly?
"What, are you kidding?"
I kissed one of Manhattan's Ten Most Eligible Singles.
"That's only happened to me, like, three or four times."
"Hey, let's walk this way."
What?
I think I see the mail-room guy from my office.
"Sorry, I just feel like everyone's staring at us."
I've been staring at my phone.
I've been out of my mind.
I had to get out just to keep f rom going crazy.
- l just saw him.
- Tonight?
- About 10:00.
- Where?
We have a special treat f or you tonight.
"As a f avour, the lady who was our star attraction has agreed to give us the song she made the sensation of the South."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mrs. Coral Chandler."
I see what Johnny meant.
"You and Johnny, you were together all the time, weren't you?"
We f ought together.
And spent your leaves together.
"London, Paris, Rome."
"Me with a gal, him without one."
Just a picture of you in his eyes.
Where is he?
"Won't you tell me, where did you see him?"
- Let's dance.
"- Please, I want to know."
I wanted her in my arms when I told her.
My right hand on her spine would feel the shock.
She'd tested pure so far.
But so did another girl I knew.
Right up to the dollar point.
And it wasn't 4 million.
- Still wear the same perf ume?
- Tell me where you saw him.
"- ""She wears jasmine, "" he said."
- Please.
He called you Dusty. lt was a name he had between the two of you.
Keep going.
"[Man On TV] You're in a very small, select group of guys."
What is it that makes you successful... and all the others knocking on the doors not so successful?
[Man #2] I'm not so sure.
"As i travel, i see television guys who would make good game show hosts."
- But i don't tell 'em.
- [Laughter]
"To me, a game show host is the icing on the cake."
But the format is the cake.
No one -
[Man Talking]
I'll love you till the day i die.
Yes!
And again.
"[Man] At 2.15 that afternoon, Johnny Clay -"
"[TV Continues, Faint]"
- He's expecting me.
- Come in.
I don't know why I did it.
It all unraveled and then one thing happened after another.
Jesus.
"I'm still in shock, boss."
"I'm in so much trouble, Larry."
No man becomes wise without stepping on the soil of fools.
Right.
Right!
But I never claimed to be a -
That's good.
Where did you get that?
Is that from the Bible?
It's from this play I wrote in eighth grade about Evel Knievel.
- Oh.
Give me 10 000 won.
How can there be a woman like you?
I'm not paying you.
You're not?
Hey!
Hey!
What are you doing?
Wow!
Look at all these checks.
You don't need to tip.
Then...
I'm taking exactly 10 000 Won.
"I wish there was a subway station nearby, so I can change my clothes."
My hand phone!
I'm waiting for a phone call.
You...
Are you jealous?
Always asking me about my sponsor.
"If you're talking about money, I also have a lot of money."
I can surpass that old man completely.
The police have been secretly taking good care of him.
And he gives them a lot of bribes.
Bribes?
"The construction will receive bribes, we need some connection from inside, all the staff members take bribes."
Did you see it?
Did you see them taking money?
Hello.
There is a lady here asking for you to come to the parking lot.
She said her hand phone is in your car.
"Ah, she's crazy."
I don't know that woman.
I was the 10 000 Won person from earlier.
It is already there!
"Were you there, Mrs Thielbacke?"
They called neither for me nor a doctor.
Well!
Hold it then!
My hands are so dirty.
"Come on, move!"
"Hold yourself straight, girl!"
What do I say if someone sees me?
That you've fetched your wages...
No hospital... is that at all doable?
"Well, there you see."
Isn't he a fine boy?
Didn't you also come into this world in your mother's bed?
But the due date was a long way off!
"Oh well, that's why I too didn't believe it when the pain sat in."
Then I would've called the doctor.
So you did it all alone...
A mother's soul
- All alone...
Bruno was there;
he helped me.
- What do you have there?
- Nothing.
I left the money and the papers in the car.
Bruno...
"Could I not return to Mrs Kunze, Bruno?"
Why do you ask questions?
"Nope, you'll stay with me for a couple of days!"
I'll find somewhere to sleep.
I've never been worried about that!
Oh my goodness... the bed!
"Oh, my God, Ted, your wrist."
"Oh, yeah, I guess it's a little swollen."
I must've strained it lifting.
"No,"
I believe our dear friend Lily was referring to your other wrist.
The one wearing the male birth control.
I was gonna go with
"""chastity bracelet."""
"God, is it possible to love you more?"
Really?
Really?
"I just saved someone's life, and you guys are focusing on this?"
"Yeah, you know what, guys?"
Leave him alone.
"All right, he's a hero."
Thank you.
Do you think that your super strength came from wearing Wonder Woman's magic wrist cuff?
"Yeah, I'll have you know that because of this cuff,"
I have a date.
With some hand lotion and the Internet?
It is possible to love you more!
She exists.
And she's right outside.
Great.
Bring her in.
You know what?
It's so nice out.
Why don't... why don't we just all go for a walk.
"It's pouring rain, Ted."
I think it's pretty obvious she can't fit through the door.
Mm.
"She is a gorgeous, athletic woman."
"Why, are you willing to offer more?"
"Oh, almost certainly."
Do you still have it?
No.
But I know where it is.
Hey!
How about a drink for you and your men?
Your fire is dying here.
Why don't you tell me where the piece is right now?
"Listen, ""Herr Mac""."
"I don't know what kind of people you're used to dealing with, but nobody tells me what to do in my place."
Freulein Ravenwood.
Let me show you what I am used to.
Nick!
Take your lousy hands off!
wait..
I.. can be reasonable.
That time is passed.
You don't need that...wait..
I'll tell you everything.
Yes.
I know you will.
Let here go!
...Whiskey?
"Shoot them, Shoot them both."
My medallion!
"Well, Jones, at least you haven't forgotten how to show a lady a good time!"
"Boy, you're something!"
Yeah?
I'll tell you what.
"Until I get back my five thousand dollars, you're going to get more than you bargained for."
I'm your goddamn partner!
No.
- I don't want it then.
- You bought it fair and square.
"But you said it was mouth painted, when really it was hand painted..."
- Calm down.
- Please get him out.
- I want my money back.
"- No, let's go."
Oh yes!
I'll just take your blanket then.
"- Frank, everyone's napping."
- Off we go.
- What's this?
- The mouth painter's blanket.
"- It's a bedspread, Frank."
- Why are you taking her blanket?
- Anything this thick is a blanket.
- It's too coarse to be a blanket.
- There's a bedspread and a blanket.
- Give me back my blanket.
- I need something to bargain with.
"- Look, I'll give you 1,000 for this."
"- Come on, she's a pensioner..."
- It's a matter of principle.
What an old con artist.
The nerve!
"We're helping a brain dead woman, all focused on that,   and old Granny Grab-All is just waiting for some sucker."
- She's just an old woman.
- I'm going to call my lawyer.
- Isn't that a bit extreme?
- Not the slightest.
Fraud is a legal matter.
You're Marta Kozlenko.
He was my father?
I lured my father to his death?
It wasn't your fault.
"He wanted it to look like a kidnapping, not a defection."
Somehow the KGB got onto us.
"We'll go to Zurich, first thing in the morning."
I'm sorry.
You're sorry?
For what?
For all of this.
"Maybe if I hadn't called you or taken you out of your life, maybe..."
It would've happened anyway.
Whoever's after us needs my numbers too and you weren't just part of the job.
"I've always cared about you, I always will."
Marta.
Alright we have to get outta here.
What's wrong?
Police are downstairs.
We made the paper.
(speaking German)
(speaking German)
You speak English?
We need you to drive us to Zurich.
We're not gonna hurt you.
But my deliveries.
I have customers.
Today we're you're only customers.
Don't even think about it.
"Thank you, Jann."
I hope we didn't cause you too much trouble.
"Appreciate it if you can, uh, wait a couple hours before calling' the police."
"–Yeah, man."
How's retirement?
–I'm shaving' a few strokes off my golf game.
–You look good.
–You I don't know.
–Ronnie Gardocki.
Joe Clarke.
Taught your boss everything he knows.
"Yeah, but you didn't teach me everything you know, right?"
That's right.
I'm saving some.
–We're gonna grab a bite.
Wanna go?
–They're busy.
"When I miss tee time at Riviera for this, you better be buying."
Riviera?
Since when do they let hacks like you play at Riviera?
You guys still here?
Come on!
"Hey, who was that with Vic?"
"–Joe Clarke, his old partner."
–They kicked him off the force.
–Why is that?
–Some punk took a swing at his last partner.
Joe knocked out like half of his teeth in front of this crowd.
Total railroad job.
Don't worry.
It's nothing like what you're going through.
So it's been a year since you called me up.
You drag my ass down here.
What's going on?
Can't I buy you lunch?
Mom.
- Birthday celebration.
- Whose birthday?
"Mom, you're missing the best part."
"Guys, Peter's here, and I need to help him with something outside just for a minute, and then I'll be right back, okay?"
What's he doing here?
"It's Dad's birthday, for fuck's sake."
Dinner's almost ready.
"Lupita, set the table."
You have hands.
Do you know he's a DEA agent?
- Huh?
Who's a DEA agent?
- That Peter guy.
Get the fuck out of here.
"I saw him leaving here and he had this jacket on that said ""DEA."""
"- Shane, stop making shit up."
- I'm not.
D-E-A could stand for a lot of things.
"It was the same kind I see on the news when they bust people, the exact kind."
- What exactly did he say to your mom?
- I don't know.
"When I saw him, he was getting into his car."
He looked really mad.
"He's mom's boyfriend, isn't he?"
I really have to get back.
I didn't mean to interrupt your celebration.
I just don't like the way our last conversation went.
- I was upset.
"- I know, and you had a right to be."
- I'm sorry I went behind your back.
- I want to be with you.
Thank you for coming.
See you next week.
[BEN CLAPPING]
Great class.
We ran into each other.
You came to my class.
I had no idea this was your class.
You called to ask me if this was my class.
"No, you never called back."
Because you told me not to call you if it was my class.
It was.
- No.
We just ran into each other.
- Okay.
We're just two innocent folks who happen to be working out near each other.
BEN:
Exactly.
Do you want a swim?
Sure.
"You know, I was just thinking why can't we be friends?"
"I mean, am I not allowed to have friends anymore?"
"I mean, am I not allowed to be friends with people that are hot?"
"I mean, what kind of reverse prejudice is that?"
I hear you.
I mean am I not supposed to be friends with a guy just because he's married?
Right.
Or has an insane smile?
Or an ass that makes me wanna dry hump?
[BEN CHUCKLES]
"- Did you just say ""dry hump""?"
- Yeah.
BEN:
So I'm just digging A long trench.
Through the gravel And the pebbles.
He needs to be Excruciatingly careful.
About the amount of time He spends down there.
He could really hurt himself At that depth.
"Hey, zeke, we're at 35 feet right now."
Copy that.
Really?
Really.
Just be careful.
"I'm seeing hardpan, Like I wanted."
But there's not even A speck of gold on it.
"Well, let's go somewhere Else more interesting."
Yeah.
Roger.
"Whoa, boy, is this..."
It's a gold worm.
But I don't know if they Necessarily correlate exactly.
To there being A lot of gold.
It would be really Nice to see.
"Just a little flake Of gold, you know?"
Are we getting deeper?
Yes.
After 2 hours At 37-feet...
"Hey, you doing okay?"
The first stages Of nitrogen narcosis.
Are setting in.
Dangerous.
"Zeke, that's way too."
You need To get out of there.
"So zeke has two choices,"
He can call it quits Or get bent.
He couldn't explain it.
See this one here?
It ain't never healed.
We're getting engaged.
That's good.
- I gotta talk to you.
- Okay.
Last night I woke up... with the worst headache I've ever had in my life.
I went into the bathroom to get some aspirin... and I happened to look in the mirror... and...
I swear to God...
I see something...
I can't describe.
But it sure as hell... is not my reflection.
And then...
I hear... this weird... howl... coming out of the sink.
And there's a voice.
It's a voice... and it's saying...
"""Do not be afraid."
Ninety-nine will die.
"Denver Nine""."
I even wrote it down.
He just keeps saying the same thing over and over for an hour... and then it stops.
And when I wake up this morning I look at this piece of paper... where I wrote down the words... and this thing is on it.
I did not draw that.
- Gordon?
- What?
"Gordon, you..."
your ear's bleeding.
What?
"This CAT scan is clean, Gordon."
No sign of any physical problem.
Are you sure?
- I'm gonna cut.
- Prep the area.
Here we go...
Tube!
We have an airway.
"I was looking for rings, trying to butter up her parents."
"I just called them, by the way."
They're going to be here in the morning.
Hard to imagine.
Losing your partner like that.
Yeah.
"So, Dallas."
It's a great opportunity.
You got all kinds of opportunities here.
- A state of the art facility.
"- Come on, you're a surgeon."
All you need is a sharp knife and some thread.
"""State of the art""!"
You're not going there for any opportunity.
- You're following a fella.
- I'm not following a...
Peter and I are going together.
Whatever gets you through the night.
"You know, she..."
She told me in the doorway of a Portuguese bakery in Montreal.
She was in love with a woman.
"And she was happy, you know?"
"I mean she was crying when she told me, but she was happy."
"Took a lot of guts, falling in love like that."
You guys stayed friends?
"Yeah, mostly."
Mostly.
- You're right!
"Letting your dad rot in jail, that's serious."
"Changing your name, that's Napoléonic!"
"What part are you going to play in your new family, shit-guzzler?"
"Shit, help me, Matalon!"
"How long have I been saying she's nuts, boss?"
"Start digging your grave, dickhead!"
Yours will only need a lid on top.
Music!
Roll end credits!
- I love you!
- My God.
Can you stomach this?
You should have gone to a posh deli in Neuilly.
- Does he love her or something?
- He hates her!
Who the hell asked you?
"And who's you, anyway?"
"Sorry, I didn't want to hurt you."
Idiot!
You'll regret that very much.
"So, Léo!"
What do you think of Parisian Nights?
"This is nothing, wait for the main course!"
Don't you miss the pigs?
"- You won't snout, will you?"
- No.
Why?
I don't judge anyone.
Who judges the judges here?
"Men who have women and friends, they're shelters from justice."
Can you keep on picking my dishes?
"Look, Ronon says we're close."
"If we lose the trail now, we may never catch the Wraith."
Rodney and I will find her.
"Alright, but be careful."
Understood.
I'll come with you.
"No, I think it's best if you stay here."
"Look, is there anywhere that she liked to go?"
Any favourite hiding spots or favourite places?
"Yes, she often goes off for hours at a time, up into the hills."
"I don't like it, but she doesn't listen to me."
It's a start.
"You know, I thought it was pretty nuts, when Ronon was trying to track a Wraith through this forest."
"Now that it's just us, do you feel any better?"
Oh yeah.
Supremely confident.
Father.
Ellia.
Where did you go?
I was hiding.
I didn't want the others to know.
To know what?
Ellia!
Why did you take the retrovirus?
Because I don't wanna be this way anymore!
I hate what I am.
You heard what Dr Beckett said.
You know the retrovirus isn't ready.
I have no choice.
"When they kill the other Wraith, I won't be able to pretend anymore."
Pretend what?
I've wanted to tell you for a long time.
The stars shall be your guide.
"As long as we're headed east, that's the direction we're supposed to be going."
I'm looking for the Little Dipper.
"If I could find the Little Dipper, I could find the North Star."
"Shane, help me find the Little Dipper."
"What do I look like, Harriet Tubman?"
Fine!
"I'll do it by myself, okay?"
You guys are no help!
Just...
Just...
Welcome to Hump Island!
It's time to feast here in the belly of the beast here at Eden East!
Now can you feel it?
Come on!
"Man, we are about to get this party started right!"
You guys ready?
Bingo!
"Hey, yo, check it out, y'all!"
A luau fire and drum show is coming up real soon!
Some of the best drummers in the whole world.
Don't forget to check it out!
This place is out of control.
"What could she be possibly getting into over here, man?"
"Come on, let's not get ahead of ourselves."
"For all we know, she could be sitting in a corner sulking somewhere."
"Hey, we can do this."
"We get in, we get out, we're back before sunrise."
I know...
I know that girl.
San Diego!
I know that girl.
"Here's a dollar, kid."
- Treat your folks to dinner.
- Wow!
♪ Memories are made of this ♪
♪ The memories you gave me ♪
♪ Serve it generously with love ♪
♪ The memories you gave me ♪
"♪ One man, one wife... ♪"
"Oh, come on, ladies."
Buy something already.
"Oh, Sue, why are you trying to sell containers to that fat tub of shit?"
She's never had a leftover in her life.
That's the great Jim Reeves.
Hard to believe it's been ten years since we lost him in a horrific plane crash.
Lucky bastard.
"- Hey, mister."
You a pervert?
- No!
Then why are you staring at ladies through that window like one?
- That's my wife in there.
- How come you're not at work?
How come you're not leaving me the fuck alone?
I'm gonna tell my dad you swore at me.
He's a cop.
"Then he can solve your murder, you nosey little shit!"
"Frank, no!"
You've got to stop swearing at other people's children.
You're right.
"Hey, go play with your father's gun!"
- Frank!
- I didn't swear.
Would you please go in and carry out the rest of the stuff I didn't sell?
"I admit that I was worried at start how would I get used to another man's presence under my roof, but Fabian was so quiet and unnoticeable that I even felt unpleasant."
As if I asked this from him.
I haven't seen him for days.
Yes?
Good...
How do you do.
"A coffee, maybe?"
If you don't mind.
Ok.
Come on in.
"You're puzzled about all this, right?"
About my charts.
Yes.
What is it?
"I'm into statistics, you know."
Only as a hobby.
I classify all kinds of data.
"I may show you sometimes, if you want."
Good morning.
- Good morning.
Nice day.
And you already got up.
- I haven't even slept.
"Why, are you suffer from insomnia?"
I was working until a minute ago.
You know how it is.
It's better not to leave it for tomorrow.
"Tomorrow, one may get a toothache, or a headache..."
"The years are later, too."
And then it's late for ideas.
"You've been working with statistics, right?"
- Yes.
Yes.
"And he's sincere and easygoing, and sexy,"
I just really like him.
Daddy?
Christine.
What?
- That's my date.
- That's my father.
- You're father?
- Your date?
You got to be freaking kidding me.
Don't answer that.
"Hi, we're not home right now."
"So leave a message for Christine,"
"- Ritchie, - and... say it."
Matthew.
"Oh, come on."
"Hi, Christine, this is Jeff."
Haven't heard from you since our date.
Don't know if you got my message so I thought I'd leave another one.
"I'm hoping that you didn't get the first message, because now there'd be two messages on your machine and that would make me look not cool."
And I think we both know how cool I am.
Bye.
"Well, he sounds cool."
Why aren't you talking to him?
I thought you liked him.
"No, I do like him but he's new Christine's dad."
I mean we had a great first date and everything but don't you think that's weird?
That he wants a second date with you-- absolutely.
Shut up.
You'd marry me in a second.
"Besides, I'm too busy to date."
No one told me you were Australian.
Is that a problem?
Only if being horny as hell is a problem.
"Uh, okay, well, Lizzie has not been herself."
She's not moving very much and she's getting night sweats.
Just take a look at her.
Oh!
What is it?
I hate it!
Lizzie!
Lizzie?
Lizzie!
Lizzie is a lizard!
"I love snakes, but I absolutely hate lizards."
Lizards are a myth.
And she's been very weak.
She hasn't been moving very much lately.
"Ugh, you should have gotten a snake."
They wriggle all over the place.
Do you think I should enter more crickets into her diet?
"Oh, look, you're clearly flipping out about this."
I need to talk to him on his own.
Is there a master bedroom we could go to?
"Uh, the kitchen's right over here."
"Yeah, we could go to the kitchen."
"No, you stay here, mind the leg snake!"
"I could tell Trevor had a thing for me, plus, I needed to tell him what I was gonna do."
Listen.
Your snake's clearly gonna die unless I do surgery on it.
I don't find you attractive.
You'll come 'round.
"- No, I won't."
- What did he have to drink?
- A bit too much vodka.
- It's Tuesday afternoon.
- We were celebrating his grades.
- You must be really proud of him.
- We certainly are.
"We are, too."
I'm taking you home.
- Get better soon.
"- We'll phone tomorrow, babe."
What are you at?
The last one sort of didn't work.
Alex went diving.
- Come on.
"That's not X, it's coke."
- I said I didn't want any.
You never want anything.
DRUGS
I started using drugs...
Somebody offered me some.
"Everyone does them, so I did too."
When we use them...
nothing can stop us.
"Drugs are a way of escaping from your problems, yes."
My world without drugs Emptiness.
Coke makes you cooler because you are part of the crowd.
You feel you can do anything.
Nothing's impossible.
You can have whoever you want.
Nobody's better than you.
"The line between life and death, right?"
That's the best high of all.
Who did it?
We did it.
Better not be anything missing.
This is private property.
So was the radio private property.
So were Manfredi and Johnson.
What about the radio?
"Yeah, what about it?"
Cut the horsing around.
We know he's the stoolie and what the payoff is.
- So let's get on with it.
-Let's get on with what?
"What is this, anyway?"
A kangaroo court?
Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
You make my mouth water.
"You're all wire happy, boys."
You've been in this camp too long.
You put 2 and 2 together and it comes out 4.
Only it ain't 4!
"What's it add up to you, Sefton?"
It adds up that you got yourselves the wrong guy.
Because I'm telling you the Krauts wouldn't plant two stoolies in one barracks.
"And whatever you do to me, you're gonna have to do all over when you find the right guy."
Watch it.
The kommandant.
"Achtung, Herr Kommandant."
"Good evening, sergeants."
"Little coffee klatch you are having, eh?"
"Gloomy in here, isn't it?"
Where is the barracks chief?
"Yes, sir."
"Yes, okay."
Thank you.
"You've seen the girl, now let's make this thing happen."
Jacob wants me to stay with her.
"He doesn't care about the money, he wants his daughter."
And he wants to remember who she is.
Where's the injection gun?
"Oh yes, this is vintage Jacob."
Always loves a chess game.
And always three moves ahead.
I have it.
It stays here.
It's the only way he'll give you his numbers.
You'll meet him at Fraumunster Church.
And what stops me from killing you right now?
Because you're a smart man.
"You're gonna meet Jacob, he'll call, you'll have us released and after that, you'll have the numbers and Jacob."
"You may have lost your memory Marta, but, uh, you still have balls."
"If you haven't heard from me in an hour, kill them both."
She really needs to go to the bathroom.
Do I look like I fucking care?
Just tell me where it is.
Fuck.
The end of the corridor.
(speaking German)
(speaking German)
"Oh, shit."
I'll walk.
Here.
(speaking German)
Hey.
Get the fuck off.
And it'll just be really great to be back in my old room again.
"Don't worry, Jenny."
We'll- we'll find a place for you.
"Well, that's great,"
"Because I'm moving in, too."
Downstairs.
I was waiting to tell you
Until the board approved my sublet tomorrow.
But I'm very excited.
All my family together under one roof again.
"Better watch out, Humphreys."
"They say love makes a family, but on the Upper East Side,"
Everyone knows it's real estate.
"Hey, dad, I'm sorry I'm running so late."
Can you save me a waffle?
Always.
I'll put one in the oven for you.
"Uh, how's Lily?"
She's great.
And you?
How you holding up?
"I mean, it must be weird."
Lily's ex-husband is now her doctor.
It was at first.
"But the fact is,"
He's just her doctor now.
I'm her husband.
"Uh, by the way, Vanessa can't make it."
Said she had to be somewhere.
"Oh, right."
"The, um, internship at CNN."
They called me as one of the references she listed.
- You spent what?
"Yes, we spent a lot of money."
"So, what?"
How much?
Why do you want to know?
Just tell me.
"Apart from our savings, we have borrowed some."
Varun!
"- Varun, stop!"
Your eyes are very sensitive to light now.
It will take some time to get used to excessive light.
You will have to use spectacles.
"- Okay, doctor."
'Calling Deepa'.
Varun.
Think practically.
You say that she used to come to the restaurant everyday.
But you don't know what she looks like.
You neither have her photo nor her address.
How do we search for her?
I promised to help her.
She must have pinned her hopes on me.
Would she have any idea about my accident?
She would have thought that I had cheated her.
There is no wrong from your side.
Don't think too much.
Varun.
Excuse me.
Do you remember the girl who used to come with me?
Everyday I see lot of people.
Thank you.
Tell me if you see her.
- They're talking to Phan and his crew?
"- Phan's crew, yeah."
Thanks for the info.
Just letting you know what it looks like.
Gotta think about this a little bit.
Things are moving fast.
Let me know what you wanna do.
"I'm gonna go visit the shoe shop next door, OK?"
Don't go anywhere else.
Come straight back here.
She's such a good kid.
God knows how that happened with all we put her through.
"Yeah, I worry about that."
You know Bob's new girlfriend?
What was her name again?
Lorna.
How did they hook up?
I have no idea.
Bob keeps his business to himself.
"I think they met at a club, or something."
I think she's having an affair with Jim.
You know anything about that?
You're kidding?
"Alison, don't lie to me, please."
I won't tell anybody you told me.
I think it happened just the one time.
When?
"When he was on his way back from Seattle, I guess."
When he was on the island.
That's the DEA building.
They've got offices over there.
"Do you know that for sure, the DEA got offices in there?"
"Come on, its my turn."
Please?
Just keep it legal.
"Wait, you sure your parents wont come home?"
They could.
"But, this isn't their Jacuzzi."
Brooke... whose house is this?
I don't know!
Does it matter?
Here you go.
"Wow, for the diet special that looks pretty damn tasty."
Oh!
Sorry.
"Things have worked out pretty well, huh?"
"Karen's café gets to stay open, and I get to see a little more of my sister-in-law."
"So, how are you doing with things?"
"Uh, we had our first counseling session yesterday."
Dan and counseling.
It's kind of like Hannibal Lector at a salad bar.
"Well, if you think it would help, I'd be happy to talk to Nathan."
I think he'd like that.
"I know you like my women, Keith, but come on!"
Deb's still my wife.
Won't be for long if you keep this up.
I'm taking Nathan to dinner tonight.
Do you have a problem with that?
- Yeah.
He needs a break from you.
- You can't stop me from seeing my own son.
"Oh, actually I can."
"By telling you nicely, or calling a lawyer."
Your choice.
"The soldiers met Snow White, is that right?"
"Yes, they met Snow White..."
"No, you are fooling me!"
Smart you!
"So, where did you stop?"
Why should I answer your question?
"Right, I don't know why you want to answer me!"
What a shame!
"Chan Mon-gut, you've gone too far!"
Wipe your sweat first!
I think you haven't had good sleep lately.
Does Ho Chun visit you every night?
Your Honour!
"Let's go back to our topic, what did you do that night?"
"I told you, I read at home."
"No, I don't mean the night Chun was killed."
I mean the night before he was killed.
"Before killing him, I went..."
Yes!
You're finished!
"Your Honour, I request to reach the final address."
Damn you!
Tell us what you did on the night before Chun's death.
Police.
No!
I mean Chan Mon-gut.
What's the matter?
The defence counsel's personal point of view is really amazing!
But according to the legal procedure...
Come on!
Why are you so stubborn?
You're charged with contempt of court.
in her job description?
Their job is to follow instructions.
So is yours.
You knew that I couldn't let this go.
"as it turns out, I was right."
I apologize for doubting you.
Oh.
"Well, thank--thank-- we're--we're all human."
As far as I know.
You know that this was only Macpherson's first move.
And he's planning something... bigger.
Any guesses what his plan might be?
No.
I don't know.
I don't want to wait to find out.
You know what the Talmud says?
"""If someone's coming to kill you, get up early, kill them first."""
"It also says ""don't rush into any unnecessary danger."
"A miracle may not save you."""
Previously on Warehouse 13...
So you know it's MacPherson.
- I'm right.
"- Yes, I'm afraid you are."
And he now has a sword which renders him invisible.
Now it's up to you to stop him.
You always hurt the one you love.
"Okay, just stop."
"Okay, stop and think this through."
Guess what.
I'm still taking the artifact.
"I can't let you do that, Pete."
I'm sorry.
Let's see what frightened you.
It's okay.
Come.
"Dr. lemelle, allow me to introduce miss Porter, our new patient."
Isabel is new to her medication and she had a bit of a fright watching you work.
It was the noise.
It was still alive.
"It's distasteful, yes, but it's the only way to procure a fresh specimen."
Poor thing.
Perhaps.
"But I cannot Sally forth and saw at the skulls of dainty, melancholic humans for my research, can I?"
No.
"Come, Isabel."
Let's leave the good doctor to his work.
Here we are.
Thank you.
Safe and sound.
Do not wander the halls in a place like this.
Yes?
Yes.
"Good night, miss Porter."
Scream and I will slit your throat!
Please don't hurt me.
We need to build!
"Saying, but I didn't know you Were trying to go down a cliff."
I can't go that way.
This is the farthest you've Ever taken us out of nome.
This is the biggest gold We're going after.
Lookit.
"Everybody needs to get Their panties on, and let's go."
We got 'em on.
But it's pretty!
This for a party?
Mi?
"ka, you won't look good in this."
How can you say that?
I've got something to go with it...
A different material!
"I wanted to, but there wasn't anything."
Hardly anything at all.
But this is nice!
Then I'll hurry...
And now this.
So how do you want it?
"I don't know, you can advise us."
One meter twenty.
How much did they give me?
"One meter twenty, but double width."
- That's enough for the whole dress!
- From this?
She'll have one more dress.
Isn't it some mistake?
Good evening.
What can I bring you?
Good evening.
Looks nice here.
"Good wine and good prices, if only we had hard currency to pay for it."
We've only got ordinary crowns.
Bring us some good cheap wine.
"Two Martells, please."
And seven decilitres of wine.
Just a moment. I must know what it will cost.
"Grenadine for my daughter, please."
"I'm pretty sure you didn't give it to me the other night, Joe."
"You're right, but that's only because at the time"
"I didn't want to burden you with what was only a gut feeling, with fortunately turned out to be wrong."
You thought she was dead?
I did.
But I have confirmation that is not the case.
So where is she?
When's she coming home?
I don't know.
And she's not.
At least not anytime soon.
The word is that Doris is active again.
That's all I got.
Everything else is classified.
It's classified.
Wow.
Mm.
I want you to please keep looking for her.
"You shake the trees and you find her, okay?"
"Steve, your mom stayed hidden for 20 years."
She is not gonna be found.
She'll surface when she's ready.
Yeah.
When do you think that's gonna be?
I think that'll be when she's prepared to face you.
Hey.
How you holding up?
"I'm, uh..."
I'm a mess.
"You know, I just keep telling myself"
I did everything I could to save him.
"No, Catherine."
"Right, cover me."
"Fuck, they're in the hotel."
We don't need the sniper anymore either.
Go inside.
See the colonel.
"Over here, laddie."
Arm yourself to the teeth.
Don't touch that.
Emma Gee is mine.
That's what my father used to say...
'A grenade a day keeps the enemy at bay.'
Come along.
"Chop, chop."
Big Sally.
"Well, home is where the battle is."
"Private, it is our duty to ensure that no harm comes to the cripple, understood?"
Follow on.
"If you can hear them, but you can't shoot them, you can probably grenade them."
"Drop an egg down there, laddie."
Forward.
Come along.
"Good Lord, how embarrassing."
Dodged a bullet on that one.
I'll cover you.
You go around them.
"Don't let the cripple get below you, laddie!"
Jolly good.
"Hold on, wait."
Help me with the cripple.
"Retreat five paces back on my command, laddie."
"Spasibo, Yuri."
My quarters are actually up there.
"Oh, you'll be the prettiest mouse at the ball."
"What do you mean, mouse?"
"Uh, nothing."
Sounds like Elka's ready to go.
- Do you need a lift?
"- No, no, no."
We're gonna wait for Joy.
You go ahead without us.
So the newly beautiful mouse headed off to the ball.
It's almost too easy.
"Now, what's our ending?"
We'll find out at the ball.
The Earl is there.
"The two sisters will vie for him, and then whatever happens, that's the ending to our book."
What?
No.
"No, no, no, no."
You can't let a little thing like a scooter and an eye patch stop you.
How about this?
I knocked my crown out trying to open my eye drops bottle.
You cannot give up.
This would be a terrible ending.
Where would Cinderella be if she'd stayed home and felt sorry for herself when her sister was off having fun at the ball?
Look at me.
I'm hardly Cinderella.
"Victoria, she's right."
Jill is the one that got beautiful.
"Oh, that's true."
You've had your time.
Jill's Cinderella now.
Shut up!
"I'm Cinderella, and I'm going to the ball."
Fine.
"But when we get the POWs from the Abbey, we'll take Miri too."
"- Miri, the pretend nun?"
- She's motivated.
She can shoot.
And she trailed me through the woods for a half hour before I heard her.
None of you can do that.
That's all we know about her?
Everything else you can learn while you train her.
Brilliant.
Three weeks till the invasion.
Lots of time.
"Speaking of which,"
I've been thinking.
"We're working on the attack, but without defense, it could all be for nothing."
What do you mean?
We need to know what they know.
"Which networks are blown, who we can trust."
We don't know how much René told them.
Counter-intelligence.
We need to protect ourselves.
Anticipate attacks.
- Track his movements.
Feed him lies.
"- And by ""him"" you mean..."
Franz Faber.
He knows a lot about us.
It's time we learned more about him.
- We can't get anywhere near the HQ.
- No.
But maybe we can hit him closer to home.
_
Zach didn't even sleep with Hallie.
And even if he had how could I blame him?
I practically...
pushed him into Hallie's arms.
She was right.
Maybe I do play victim sometimes.
Everyone's been right about me.
"You're afraid of a real relationship, Dale."
I've just had a blind eye to it.
I've scared of getting hurt.
Because he's too perfect.
I've kept Zach at arm's length.
You are so afraid of getting hurt that you end up picking guys that have absolutely no substance.
Hey...
Am I gonna live the rest of my life...
with guys like... this?
Just to... avoid someone... real?
No.
Hell no!
I'm ready to change.
If I get... one more chance...
I won't screw it up... again.
If I just get one more... chance.
I'll be right there.
What are you doing here?
I wanted to come by and talk.
"Look, I think we've done enough talking."
I'm really not interested in talking with you.
I just wanted to say that I understand that this isn't gonna work.
"You and I, that is."
Ok.
Why did you hang out with me?
- Bye.
No way.
My mom will already be on my last nerve.
I don't want Viv getting on nerves
I haven't even discovered yet.
Touchdown!
That's another 5 bucks you owe me.
"Guys, this is my teaching assistant, Vali."
"Vali, these are my kids..."
"Oliver, Taylor, and Anna-Kat."
The boy seems shorter than I imagined.
"TV off, guys."
But we have a bet on the game.
Thanksgiving isn't about football.
It pretty much is.
It's only not when you have a dad who isn't into sports.
I'm into sports!
Name three NFL quarterbacks.
I don't have to prove anything to you.
TV off.
Greg!
You're killing me!
Why do you always invite one of your TAs?
You mean invite someone from a foreign land with nowhere to go to join us on a day when we open our hearts?
The last thing that I need...
Hi!
We are so happy that you are with us.
I like your track suit.
"I must say, you are very beautiful."
I like your size.
"Okay, that was creepy."
It's no less creepy than you hitting on my mom.
I gotta hurry and get back to the shop before Mrs. Sparling's dryer shuts off.
I'll be out of a 50-cent tip.
"Don't worry, honey."
Aggie's gonna fix you up.
That German girl sure was pretty.
Her name is Hilla.
What dress did you get for her to wear?
A blue one with a...
bow on the back.
I left it in her room.
"That's not like you, Melvin."
You're always after me for forgetting' things.
"Well, you better get it."
We can't bury her naked.
Even if she didn't have no money.
You knew her?
Nah.
But you hear more in a beauty shop than a priest in confession.
"Uh, don't-- don't overdo it."
Just--Just keep it natural.
"Sure, Melvin."
[ Door Closes ]
"What are you doin' back here, Sam?"
I came to get a dress to bury Hilla in.
You decided to stay for the late show?
"I thought you were gonna sit this leap out, Al."
"Now, don't get me wrong."
"I've had a lot of fixations on women, but this-- It's not one of your cheap flings."
Whatever.
This is an obsession.
"Look at her, Al."
She's so young... and beautiful and... full oflife.
I can get a full-time job.
But what about college and law school that you've always talked about?
That's just a dream.
I can't do it.
My old man doesn't make enough...
Whose father does?
Not everyone in college is a millionaire's son.
Don't get so steamed up.
"Ted Carter, you've always wanted to be a lawyer."
"Now, go be it."
Don't crumple up at the first obstacle.
"The first obstacle's the biggest, the money."
"Well, then get over that and the rest should be easy."
Do you know how long it takes to become a lawyer?
What difference does it make?
It's what you wanna do in life.
One of the things I want to do is marry you.
"If I don't do it now, maybe I never will."
"Ted, the only family I'll ever have will be half yours."
I'll wait no matter how long it takes.
Good night.
"Good night, Selena."
Ted thank you.
Ma?
Ma?
Joey?
I thought you was something out of a dream.
Where's Ma and Joey?
"Let's have a drink, celebrate your growing up."
Where's Ma and Joey?
They're working at a party at Harrington's.
Let's have a drink.
Good.
- We should all keep in touch.
- Definitely.
"Mark, pay me more attention."
Mark!
This is the last time that you see me.
I wanna go to Marosi.
Are you out of your mind?
I want to look him in the eye and I just wanna ask him some questions.
I really dont't think that's a good idea.
He said that he killed Jesse.
So I just wanna meet him.
And either you gonna help me out or I'm gonna have to sort this myself.
"Hello, Mr. Wells."
I want to talk about my brother.
I killed him.
"I chose him,"
I took him and I killed him.
"Three acts, simple."
I don't believe you.
"They found the bodies of the other 4 boys that you killed, but not my brother."
Why not?
I burnt it.
Why would you do that?
Because he was younger.
And what I did to him... was disgusting.
I like young boys.
And I liked Jesse.
A lot.
You're already facing life for the other 4 boys that you killed.
"So you took the rep for Jesse in order to secure yourself privileges in prison, didn't you?"
Get yourself back on the front pages.
"You know, I'm almost sad this negotiation is over."
Why?
I was just starting to enjoy your company.
Same here.
What do you say you and I bill our clients for another two hours?
Let's make it three.
"Oh, hi."
What are you doing here?
Looking for you.
"Uh, I followed the flyers."
Well... you found me.
"So unless you're gonna help look for Gabriel,"
I'm kind of busy.
"Well, you know..."
"You know, I was serious the other night."
I mean...
I'd love to see you again.
If you're interested.
I am interested.
But that's the problem.
I don't understand.
How... how is that a problem?
"Look, first off..."
It feels a little like you and your wife haven't totally worked out the open marriage thing.
So that's a little more complicated than I'd like.
And second...
"if I have to be honest,"
I like you.
Which means...
I don't want to share you with anyone.
Oh.
"I'm sorry, Elliot."
It's a pet scheme of mine.
- A recreation spot for the kids.
"- Kind of a kindergarten place, huh?"
"No, it's for the big fellas too."
You'd be surprised how tremendously it's helped to keep the kids from becoming...
Hoodlums like me?
- You've cost me a lot of prayer.
- I've been in kind of a retreat myself.
- Yes.
Will you be here for some time?
- Depends.
I got a little business to attend.
- I gotta find a place to live.
- Get a room here in the parish.
- Not a bad idea.
No place like home.
"- Yes, and it's great to have you home."
- I came back to take a look at your kisser.
- Stick around and take a lot of them.
This is Maggione's.
Go in and get a furnished room.
"Remember her, don't you?"
Took a lot of good lead pipe out of that cellar.
Church is just around the corner.
I can drop in to see you from time to time.
- See you at Mass Sunday?
- Sure.
I'll help you with your collection.
- It's a deal.
- Fair enough.
- Mrs. Maggione at home?
- What do you want?
It's like he was a figment of my imagination.
PHILIP:
I'm fairly certain I'm not welcome here.
Ding-ding-ding.
It's late.
I've been sitting here waiting to make a scene for hours.
What do you want?
I'm very lonely.
That's unfortunate.
I don't like teaching creative writing as much as I assumed I would.
"Well, you're a cruel, miserable person, so it makes sense you'd end up in a miserable situation."
What happened to my desk?
That's my bonus desk.
- Nobody at the school likes me.
- Nobody here likes you.
I think I might resign and come home.
(MUMBLING) You don't live here.
You live upstate.
"No, I don't want that to be my home."
It's lonely and sad and the faculty have turned on me.
Boo-hoo!
The last few weeks have been so hard for you.
Whose cat is this?
It's my cat.
- We don't have a cat.
- Apparently I do.
"Oh, look, see?"
There it is.
"Come here, big boy."
This is Gadzookey.
"Gadzookey, meet Philip."
Don't get attached.
"Did you park on the street, or did you use valet?"
"Street, 'cause i-I can't afford valet."
Good.
Meter or lot?
Meter.
And i went to a coffee shop to get some change.
"Okay,give me all the alleys in the area"
By commercial buildings near the hotel.
Now you said you threw the knife in the alley where you parked.
Is it any of these?
"These are near stores,"
If you threw the knife near where you got the change.
Um... it's one of those.
Is it that one just off fordham road?
"Yes,yes."
That's it.
I'm sorry.
That's okay.
You did all right.
Print that.
We'll get our guys down there and check it out.
Looks like our paralegals have found something.
Let's hope it's a knife.
L.A.P.D. Is really working this one.
They love big media cases almost as much as we do.
"We found something over here,mr."
Nicholson.
"Oh,nice."
"Well,who says trial work isn't glamorous?"
Who's got a glove?
"I do,mr."
Nicholson.
All right.
- How did it go?
- Nothing to it.
I left his car at the airport and took a bus back.
"Good, then all we've got to worry about is his wife."
This will control the lights in the house.
"Ready, Cinnamon."
"The more I think of that Harper dame, the more I wonder if she shouldn't have disappeared with her husband."
Yeah.
"Well, that can be arranged."
Burt!
Burt!
It's her.
"Burt, please."
My husband is back.
He's in the house.
"I was in the kitchen, fixing something to eat, and I heard a noise in the living room."
I went in there but there was nothing there.
Nothing but cold.
It was colder than anything I've ever felt in my whole life.
Then I felt as if someone were watching me.
"I turned around and there he was at the top of the stairs, looking at me."
"Well, whatever it was, lady, it wasn't your husband."
"Oh, it was."
It was.
"He was just like he was this afternoon, with blood, here, on his sweater."
There he is.
I'm terribly sorry.
"I was coming over to my brother's, I saw Lynn come up the road."
Is everything all right?
"Lynn, are you all right?"
You look strange.
- What shall we make of that?
"- Made your point, Fi."
- Did I?
- Yep.
You did.
What about D.C.?
- You still goin'?
- I have to.
"If I don't, it won't be long before Cowan sends someone else here to kill me."
I need him to know I can get to him too.
I need him to know right now.
And you need help.
And you know it.
I don't think that's a good idea.
- Is that a tactical judgment or a personal one?
- Both.
Everybody I know is in danger right now- everyone I'm close to.
Well...
I'm willing to risk it... if you are.
- How's my mom?
- Locked up cozy and tight with a cigarette and a shotgun... ready to kill anything that comes through the door.
"- Here you go, Doug."
My lucky vest.
- It'll look great over my shirt.
- Thanks.
"- It's a little worn, but it'll do the trick."
- Are these bullet holes?
- Yeah.
I broke it in for you.
It's a short ride to the U.S. Attorney's office.
Just think of it as a precaution.
It's like a seat belt.
Can I ask you something?
What?
That Japanese guy.
You said he's a ghost.
$0?
I don't get how a living person can be a ghost.
It's not a living human.
He died a long time ago.
He must have been human once.
But not anymore.
"So then, the ghost got inside him?"
"Well, that's how it started."
"Not everything that moves, breathes, and talks is alive."
Countless people have perished because they didn't understand that.
If it's not stopped... that demon will destroy this village.
Demon?
An evil ghost!
"Even among other demons, he's a master of evil."
"If that's true, why did it have to be your daughter?"
What sin did that young girl ever commit?
Yes.
"If you go fishing, do you know what you'll catch?"
No.
He's just fishing.
Not even he knows what he'll catch.
"He just threw out the bait, and your daughter took it."
That's all it was.
Park Chun-bae
- This one?
- No.
Money.
"Yes, money."
"This one time, he didn't want to drink out of my latte."
Oh!
"We're doing a good thing, saving Lana from this scumbag."
"Yeah, but, which one of us is going to save her?"
Now I'm wondering if you're a racist.
"No, come on."
You know what?
"No, we can't do this."
Remember what happened the last time we competed over a girl?
"Okay, first, we need to go to a place that has money."
"Yeah, then we need to go to a place that has pants."
Yeah.
You know what?
You are absolutely right.
"From now on, we will only hit on girls whose boyfriends are not in the hospital."
Yeah.
Classy.
- Is Dr. Lonsdale coming?
"- No, he said you should handle it."
"Okay, well, that's, like, three babies."
That seems like plenty.
"They're quintuplets, doctor."
There's two more.
Are you (Bleep) Kidding me?
This has seen better days.
"Hey, sexy."
We got to talk.
Things are getting out of hand at work.
I delivered quintuplets.
I hope.
"I mean, I didn't really actually count them at the end."
Congratulations!
"She swings like Tarzan, through the vine."
I don't think that Paul chews that.
Can you believe Antoniette?
Watching her in predator mode is better than...
Shark week on the Discovery Channel.
"- Hello, whores!"
- There is special China Chow...
He' s probably giving some hints on how to remain in the spotlight... without actually doing anything.
- I gotta take notes.
- I think I'll follow you.
"How are you doing, sweetie?"
I don't know.
"Kind of tired, I don't feel so well."
I think I'll just go home and get some sleep.
Have a drink of bourbon it hits the head for 15 hours.
You'll be a million times better.
We changed the ceramics?
- I think so.
Then.
It's normal.
There's always smoke the first time.
Don't worry.
Thank you.
You don't look too well.
- I'm fine.
The vacuum cleaner is not the reason.
Is it?
No.
I have other problems.
A woman.
I bet.
- What makes you think that?
I couId tell you a thing or two myself.
Who supports us?
What about after this experiment?
Who will work?
Me.
"You think I don,t support us?"
"You don,t know what it,s like being stuck here, spied on by those voyeurs in black coats!"
"I can,t even fart without being graded!"
"Think that,s fun?"
You gotta be kidding.
What do you think I do?
I work all afternoon.
You sit on your fat ass and push buttons.
"That,s all you,re good for."
Here come the insults!
",Fat ass, and all that."
"Listen, I,ve got things to say, and I mean it."
"I,ve about had it with this experiment!"
"I,m fed up living with you."
"- Why,d you come then?"
I never forced you!
You did!
I was supposed to go to Canada.
Who wanted to do this?
Who stopped me from going to Canada?
Who stopped me from acting?
"Admit it, it was you."
"Now you say you didn,t want to come here?"
- I did it for you.
"- You,re such a liar!"
You were glad to come!
"What,s more, we,re gonna get tossed out, and it,s all your fault."
–I'm not lying!
"–Yes, you are!"
"Bob tells you how to think, how to feel, how to act."
"–Without him, you're worthless."
Nothing.
–It's not like that!
And you won't leave him because you're afraid no one else will ever love you... that you'll learn Bob was right about you all along.
–No!
"–Oh, damn it, Marcy!"
–Don't lie to me!
–Why are you doing this?
Because there's a girl out there who may still be alive... and I won't let you kill her!
"Now, goddamn it!"
Tell me right now!
Where is she?
I don't know!
Really!
I don't!
I played the daddy.
I broke her.
"If she knew Bob was involved, she would've confessed... or at least given me a nondenial."
–You think?
–I don't know.
Maybe Bob's not a sadomasochistic thrill killer.
Maybe he's just an asshole.
"Problem is, he's the only asshole we've got."
"–Well, what do you got for me?"
–What you got for me?
Come on.
Embrace the relationship.
Fleetwood is fencing' again.
He's so goddamn predictable.
No.
It's the truth.
And I'm sorry that I didn't mention it before.
"Honestly, it's still sort of confusing, trying to figure out how to explain it to people."
I think it's intriguing.
"Honey, we should probably get going soon."
"Hi, Sally..."
I should apologize for the way I ran off before.
I'm Samantha.
I'm having sex with your husband.
My wife doesn't usually meet the people
I'm sleeping with.
"Oh, dear."
Sorry about that.
It's fine.
We're both still a little shaky on the rules.
Got it.
"Look, I should probably go talk to her."
But I meant what I said before.
I'd like to see you again.
So...
Let me know.
Sure.
Definitely.
"Sure, they're throwing me a party now, but the ballet world is brutal."
"The girl I'm replacing was out by 24, with busted knees and a torn groin muscle..."
"Oh, and anorexia."
So at least she was skinny.
That's awful.
You don't get many shots at this.
"So when it comes, you have to claw for it..."
Even if it destroys you.
"Isn't he, um..."
crazy?
Tracy's had his problems in the last few years.
I am a Jedi!
I am a Jedi!
I am a Jedi!
"The important thing to remember is, he was never charged with a crime."
It's not illegal to fall asleep on your neighbor's roof.
Nor should it be.
Tracy Jordan is the third heat.
I don't know where we're gonna find room in the budget for a guy like Tracy Jordan.
I think I do.
What are you doing?
"Sometimes when I have these stress dreams, if I go to sleep in the dream, I come out of it."
"""This is not a dream."""
"Tracy Jordan is in New York today, Liz."
I'd like you to have lunch with him.
"We have a show tonight, Mr. Donaghy."
"I don't know if your research covered this, but we do a dress rehearsal, and then a live show."
That's tonight.
This is lunch.
"If it's not a good fit, I'll drop the whole thing."
"If I meet with Tracy Jordan, and we mutually agree that this is the worst idea ever, you'll back off?"
I'm known for being reasonable.
Okay.
"Alfredo, 2:00 p.m."
I'm not dressed for that.
You're dressed for Burger King.
Should we make it Burger King?
"Pete, hang back for me."
"Yeah, you bet."
Hey.
only the crickets answered.
And to make us more nervous...
Was he armed?
"Hey, that's when..."
I said:
We're going in.
I was determined.
Ducky was panicking.
"I thought he went to get the tire iron, but no."
He came back with a flashlight.
"I told C,duIie: don't move!"
"As we were about to go into the field, the corn started moving."
"Touchy was coming out, holding the kid by the arm."
He runs fast but not in the corn.
The kid let himself fall to the ground.
"I put the 12 gauge in his face, to keep him quiet."
When Touchy caught his breath...
What's he done to make me run like this?
Ducky showed him what the problem was.
The smashed statue.
The black kid looked at Touchy who couldn't get over it.
"Oh well, well, well..."
The kid looked less arrogant than before.
"And that's when C,duIie said:"
"Let him go, boys."
Boys...
She still called us that.
So if I understand...
"Mrs Lajeunesse wanted to let him go, but you didn't want to."
I agreed with her.
I said:
She's right.
"What are you doing here, Ryner?"
What could I say?
- This su...
"- If you say this sucks, I'm beating you up."
Don't hit me!
Relax.
The bleeding will start again.
Why are you so badly injured?
Forget the injuries.
There's something I have to tell you.
Your younger sister is gone.
Apparently she was killed some time ago.
"How do you know that, Ryner?"
I see.
I see it now.
"You're another pawn of Roland, aren't you?"
I didn't want to hear it.
I didn't want to hear that my sister is dead!
"Not from you, certainly!"
You knew it all?
"You knew that, and laughed?"
When I said I cared about you were you laughing at me for being such a foolish girl?
I had a vague idea that my sister might be dead.
But what could I do?
I...
I...
Why do we have wars?
I've got no interest in who owns what land.
That's why I said I liked afternoon naps the most.
"Tahile, Tony, and Fahle all died senseless deaths."
What are you saying?
It must be the motivated guys who start wars.
Yet they always turn away when I meet them.
As should yours.
"Then I must tear them out, if they are to obey such a command."
You must stop this.
"I have vowed to, a thousand times a day."
"To return to drink and whores, forcing you from my mind."
Then I catch glimpse of you.
And my world ends.
I have never felt greater love than when I hold my husband in my arms.
Gannicus.
What seizes you?
"You drop guard, allowing Barca advantage."
The man almost had you.
I was lost in a moment.
Caught by a dream.
Then wake from it.
Leave us.
"You are a Gaul, are you not?"
"Yes, Domina."
Many believe the seed of a Gaul to rival that of Jupiter himself.
Tell me.
How many sons sprang from your father's cock?
"Five, Domina."
And from his father before him?
The same.
"Your subligaria, remove it."
You are never to speak of this.
"Do you understand, slave?"
"Yes, Domina."
"Well, I would not look at you."
The sight turns stomach.
Enter me.
They'll drive Sharon spare.
That's a weed there.
Look.
"She belched there, inside with the telly."
Kimberley asked her if she was gonna have the baby.
I don't know.
"It's hard to believe you can get so much shite... out of only one dog, isn't it?"
- Dessie?
- Huh?
Do you not think we should tell the girls... what Sharon did was wrong?
What?
I don't mean turn them against her or anything...
"Or the baby, remember."
"- Yes, I know that."
But...
- What?
I think we should tell them.
"Without, you know..."
I think we should tell them... that it's better to be married if you're pregnant.
"Jeez, they're a bit young, aren't they?"
"I mean, Lisa, maybe."
You'll need a shears for that.
What were you thinking of telling them?
Do you think we should?
"Whatever you think yourself, Kay."
I'm only their da.
They'll laugh at me.
Times have changed.
"Jesus, where did she leave her cop-on?"
Did she never hear of contraception?
Do you remember that crombie coat you used to have?
What?
She died in my arms.
"She begged me to take the baby, but  it was very late."
Liar!
"I understand, why do not you believe me."
"It's hard to accept, that your world is breaking."
"When you are in it, pick up the pieces."
But maybe...
You believe her.
"Come Aluxia, let's play somewhere else."
"Bishop, I'm sorry, my love."
I wanted to tell you.
I feared for your life.
I knew the truth too late.
I was wrong.
We were all wrong.
"We have created them, but we do not control it."
We are not their gods.
Your destiny is yours.
"Like us, they can love..."
They can create offspring.
"They have souls, who long for freedom."
The humanoids must release them.
"Remember when we said, that we were going to this place?"
Yes.
"Across the country, up here."
"Can you remember, what's the name of this place?"
-Selegna Sol.
"""All right, Selegna Sol."
We can leave this cave cold.
The Selegna Sol.
There it is wonderfully hot.
- Are you waiting for it?
You think they would've done anything less to us?
Reagan...
I don't need the speech.
I know it's war.
This is easier for you.
"You think it's easy for me, what I do?"
The F.B. I. Called me this morning.
They want to meet with me tomorrow afternoon.
"Well, could this be a routine security check?"
No one goes to D.C. For a routine security check.
Do you know if anyone else was called?
Everyone who was at the meeting in Alexandria.
I could postpone the meeting... find out what they asked the other folks before going in there.
No.
No.
That would be suspicious.
All right.
I'll just go in then.
"Look, you don't have to worry about me."
I'll be fine.
Paul...
Emmett...
Emmett taught me how to handle this situation.
"Yeah, he was... he was one of the best."
"Yes, he was."
I miss him too.
"But we're working together now, and you need to trust me."
You give me orders.
I'll follow them.
But you inherited me.
You didn't... see something in me.
"Fred, the Americans are getting more ruthless by the day."
I love you.
I love you so much.
"You're so good, and I'm so bad."
"I'm so, so bad, and I'm weak!"
That's what I am.
"I'm weak, and I'm sorry, and-"
- Not now!
(Clinking)
(Sighs) But you're right.
I have no excuse.
None.
Except that I love doing the play.
"I was so excited to have something that was just for me, that was my thing, 'cause there I'm a singer, and today a Munchkin barfed, and no one expected me to clean it up,"
'cause there I'm not a mom.
"I'm Ozian number four, and that just made me feel... (Sighs) Special."
(Sighs) Wow.
I didn't realize how much the play meant to you.
But you know what?
"I don't want to do the play without you, so tomorrow we're marching down there and demanding that they find a place for you, too."
The play's gonna be our thing.

"- Cinderella, with a husky voice."
- Where have we met?
In another guy's dreams.
You still sing that song?
- Who are you?
- Rip Murdock.
Where is Johnny?
You haven't told me if you still sing that song.
"You remember it, don't you?"
Ex cuse me.
The boss said to ask you as a f avour will you sing that song when you were in the show?
"- l couldn't, not possibly."
"- As a f avour to him, he said."
"Yeah, I'd like to hear it."
"All right, but just that one."
"I'll take that table now, f riend, f or two."
"I hated every part of her, but I couldn't figure her out yet."
I wanted to see her the way Johnny had and hear that song with his ears.
Maybe she was all right and maybe Christmas comes in July.
But I didn't believe it.
- You've seen Johnny since he got back?
- Yes.
Where is he now?
I've been f rantic f or two days.
- He was f rantic f or three years.
- Was he?
In spite of the f act you testified against him.
"If you know Johnny, you know he understands. I had to testify."
- When did you see him?
- Day bef ore yesterday.
"He was to call and let me know about going to Mexico, so I could join him."
But he never called.
"Oh, no, I'm sorry."
"Uh, yes, I'm leaving."
But none of you are.
You may go when you're done with the re-shelving.
Enjoy the rest of your evening.
The principal wanted to see me?
No...
I did.
I'm concerned about the detention today.
How Allison ended up in there with you and Mr. stilinski.
A sink was ripped off the wall.
You're lucky I'm here to explain that to people somehow.
You realize that?
Yeah.
I do now.
Good.
Are you having sex with my daughter?
Uh...
No.
I'm not having sex with your daughter.
I certainly hope not.
Hello?
It means he was born after his mom died... by c-section.
They had to pull him out of her dead body.
"You okay, dude?"
So was it an accident or not?
"The word all over the report is ""inconclusive."""
Then his parents could have been murdered?
"If they were, then it falls in line with the Kanima myth."
You know?
It seeks out and kills murderers.
But for Jackson?
"You had promised him to tell me after the wedding, right?"
You've known for five months.
"I want to let it be for now, Helene."
You don't have the time.
What are you going to do?
Anna and the boys must not know before it's absolutely necessary.
Are you listening?
Not before it's absolutely necessary.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
We'll figure something out.
There's always a solution.
There's always something in America...
- There's nothing to do.
"- Yes, there is."
There's nothing to do!
- There's...
- No!
"- There's nothing to do, understand?"
- You can't die!
"We don't get to decide, damn it."
Let go.
Get out.
Get out of the damn car before I throw you out!
Shut the door!
- How long will you stay there?
"- One week, only one week."
- You'll come to my birthday?
"- Yes, of course."
I wouldn't miss that.
I promise.
"Shut up, you'll be next."
How?
The edema affected her brain.
You understanding?
She don't let no doctor come near her.
"She was all the time screaming, even talking to the radio."
You should have called me the minute it happened.
"Regular hospital not gonna put up with adema, so we give her a shot bring her here till the doctors, they fix up her leg."
Then we take her right out.
"2 or 3 months, she's out, good as new."
Miss...
Yes?
We want to see Mrs. Karras.
Do you have an appointment?
Yes.
Are you a relative?
I'm her brother.
He's her son.
Just a minute.
[Woman sobbing]
"You know, it's funny..."
"If you wasn't a priest, you'd be famous psychiatrist now on park Avenue."
"Your mother, she'd be living in a penthouse instead of..."
"You go in, dimmie."
I wait for you outside.
You'll find Mrs. Karras in the last bed on the left-hand side.
I'm so sorry...
"No, no, no."
Come along.
Don't bother the father.
Go to your bed.
"Father, I wanna talk."
Let me out.
"Doesn't that get an ""excuse me"" in return?"
"It's all right, Jake."
Some people just have better manners than others.
"That's okay, miss-- your husband's right."
My bad.
"Forget it, Jake."
It's Chinatown.
Your name's Jake-- you never heard that?
"All my life, Mr. Mulwray."
You okay?
Fine.
You didn't have to.
"No, I... kind of did."
Do we know that guy from somewhere?
There's something about him.
I've never seen him before.
Like... from our supermarket?
Maybe we go to the same dry cleaner?
"Well, while you keep guessing, why don't I go see if we can switch these seats, huh?"
All right.
All right.
Could we know him from work?
"All I know is, flight delays make nice people cranky and cranky people crankier."
"Well, he obviously falls under the latter category."
"...that's not how I do things, understand?"
Yeah.
Definitely the latter.
How do I know that guy?
"So, anyway, there I was, still trying to be cool on my second day at NSA."
It was my second day;
your third.
Right.
Do as you wish!
I am going to divorce you!
I will divorce you.
That's enough!
Stop bringing my name up in your fights.
Get divorced as soon as possible.
"Besides, after seeing you fight like... this, I'll neither get married nor fall in love."
God damn it!
"Between parentheses, x equals 2x cube."
You should write too.
Minus x equals...
Sinan?
Is Gamze still angry with me?
Minus x
"I don't know, dude."
"She may have told you some things, right?"
You know that she's a tough one.
We also know the problems between her parents
"Seeing her parents like that, she's totally being drawn away from love."
We cant deny that she liked you too.
And you gave her hope.
Then you didn't even come to school.
"So, she's angry..."
"Can't we just solve these questions first, and then talk?"
What about you guys?
Look man.
My dad is calling.
Hello!
I am at my friend's house.
We're studying together.
Of course not dad.
Why should I lie?
"Again, Mark, that picture makes me really uncomfortable."
"Good, go with that."
Why does it make you uncomfortable?
"Because I've never seen it before, and I don't know where you got it."
I'm sensing anger.
Let's give it a place to go.
Rip out a few sets on the muscle-maker.
No.
Break something.
Just don't break anything that's...
You know what?
Just break my nose.
"Look, Mark,"
"I can't give you what you're looking for, because the things that I'm feeling I can't put into words."
And that's the problem with people.
"We want to use words, and words are dumb."
You know how the grizzly bear processes loss?
"Yeah, I think they go to sleep for like six months, and nobody bothers them."
"The grizzly bear climbs to the top of the nearest hill, and it roars, Neal."
"Neal, this is your hill."
"Yeah, I am not going to..."
Yah!
"Oh, that feels so good."
Hoo-ah!
"My friend, you have lost your she-bear."
And I am not going to stop until I hear you roar.
Naa-ah!
Ah.
Ah.
Ow.
"Ah, oh, no."
"Uck, oh, no."
How's that for over?
"You let me find the body, Jenny."
- You pretended to be upset.
"- I'm sorry I lied, Bo."
But that was before I understood this thing we have between us.
But everything's different now.
I'll never be separated from the one I love.
"What did you do, Jenny?"
You can learn a lot from the Internet like how to turn ordinary fertilizer and paint into explosives.
When I push this button we'll be together forever.
- Okay.
"Okay, but if we're gonna go out with a bang I want it to be in your arms."
"Oh, I'd like that."
- Okay.
- Slowly.
How convenient.
They're together.
One-stop shopping.
Liar.
You're just like everyone else.
I didn't bring them.
Just calm down.
- Who are you?
- Our sister's dead because of you.
"And you took part, so you both pay."
Don't.
Don't.
She's got a bomb.
No.
This isn't supposed to go like this.
"Everybody, calm down."
We're gonna talk.
Throw down your weapons.
On the ground!
Throw down your weapons.
Silence.
"(LOLA) Let's go, there's no time to lose."
"How dare you speak to us, harpy?"
The Ministry has fallen and by your fault.
I'm helping you.
"The Ministry has it's defenses, it's own soldiers."
And I have sent the Nazis into a trap from which they can't escape.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
"And what do you think you're laughing at, ""dumbass""?"
That you think you will defeat our glorious army.
We'll see about that.
To where?
To the Ministry.
It's the only way we'll know what's going on.
These will be our shields.
I hope that the Germans are good soldiers.
"Why, so they'll kill us?"
"No, because a good army would never let their General die."
Stay with her.
"No, I'll stay."
"The more of you there, the better."
Are you sure?
Yes.
The Ministry is what matters.
Let's go.
(HITLER) Oh. (YELLING IN GERMAN)
-Pardon.
"Sorry, sorry, eh... (SPEAKING GERMAN)"
Why are you smiling?
I will find Phillip's killer.
She won't.
She's been two steps behind me this whole time.
Behind you?
I got to Austin first.
And I got to the knife.
"And although it wasn't the actual murder weapon, thank you to my contacts at the NYPD,"
I have the address to the prop master's cousin in San Pedro who kept two of the last prop knives for himself as souvenirs.
You see?
I am close.
Okay.
And may the best detective win.
Don't worry.
I will.
You realize she picked your pocket.
"Oh, yes."
Whose address is on that piece of paper?
It's a casting director my mother wanted to have a meeting with.
Hmm.
Kendall is going to be mad when she finds out.
Like I'm scared of her.
She is a master of Krav Maga.
And she is deadly with a sniper rifle from a mile and a half.
Good luck.
I could not sleep last night.
I kept having nightmares that I was sleeping with Bozo the Clown.
Please tell me you found out more.
"Okay, relax."
I spoke with Tyler's ex.
He does not have a clown fetish.
[Sighs]
[Exhales] But...
That often tells us that they know each other.
Not to mention it took many botched attempts to burn him.
Because the unsub didn't realize how difficult it is to actually burn a human body.
Or it's overkill.
He wanted Proctor to suffer the most.
[Rossi] Which definitely makes it personal.
"If he knew the first victim, it's a good chance he knew them all."
We just have to find out how.
We can start by talking to Tony Torrell's wife.
- [Door closes] - [Prentiss] How you doing?
"Uh, I'm fine."
"Uh, I'm here to see Agent Rossi."
He's going to be with you in just a few minutes.
I'm Agent Prentiss.
"Oh, I'm Kiersten Torrell."
Uh...
My husband Tony was killed last night.
"I know, and I'm very sorry."
May I sit down?
"Oh, yeah."
Are...
Are you working on his case?
"Yes, I am."
Is there a picture of him in your folder?
I want to see him.
"Kiersten, uh, your husband was very badly burned."
I don't think that's a good idea.
"What do you mean, he was burnt?"
The person who did this uses fire as a weapon.
Was Tony set on fire alive?
- We don't know that.
"- Oh, my God."
My barefoot Cinderella.
Jesse!
Don't need no slippers or a party dress.
The way you're looking right now is what I like the best.
"Singers, actors, just once a kid that wants to be a doctor."
-Hi.
-Hey.
Listen I've been thinking.
Being with you.
It's a real headache.
"And it's hard, it's complicated."
"I mean, it's a lot of work."
I'm starting to think the song outside my door.
Was a little bit misleading.
I'm not finished.
Being with you might be all those things.
But the only thing worse is not being with you.
Did that get to you like it got to me?
"Yeah, a little."
Guys with guitars.
Why do the ladies find us so dang irresistible?
Are you sure you're ready for all this?
I was ready for all this the first time I met you.
I just didn't know it.
Now come on I think I owe you pizza and a movie.
-I mean if you're hungry.
-Are you kidding?
Right now I'm torn between kissing you.
And checking the bottom of your shoe to see if you stepped in a donut.
Let me just ditch Hannah.
What about your omelet?
Sorry dad.
That's the logical choice for a Master.
But only nearby.
idiot.
It is the sixth day since the war commenced.
You are the first to make their way here.
boy?
O-Of course I am!
You want me to die?
!
and I'm no longer a Master!
I-I'm just an ordinary human.
I'm just a victim in all this!
when we can't do anything!
What?
Do you have a problem with that?
Of course not.
You are the first to withdraw from this war and to use this church's services since it was founded.
I will offer you every hospitality.
What?
You're saying I'm the only one that's been knocked out?
what will he say?
This is all you people's fault!
Rider!
Oh?
Then Rider was of no use to you?
Damn right!
she went and died like a dog!
Any other Servant would have been way more useful!
I did exactly as Grandfather said!
My preparations were perfect!
But those bastards all got in my way!
It was two against one!
He's making his way north.
He'll surface.
Aubrey.
"Hey, so I was able to filter out most of the visual noise from the doorbell video."
Did you find the vehicle that was following Aldo?
"Yeah, I'll send you a link."
It's a '97 Intrepid.
Did you get a plate number?
"I couldn't from this angle, so I went through all the traffic cams in the area."
The car belongs to Ted McKinney.
He's former military.
He actually served in Booth's unit.
Booth's not gonna like this.
"Me either, Cher."
That is not something I wanted to see.
"If you think I killed Aldo, you're nuts."
I don't know what to think.
Why were you following him?
That's my business.
"Well, you're in here, so it becomes my business now."
You really think Booth's the guy for this?
They have a history.
I can't think of anyone better.
BOOTH:
Recognize that car?
It might be mine.
It might be yours.
"Oh, I think it's yours, 'cause that is you inside of the car."
Following Aldo.
That's not true.
"""That's not true?"""
Come on.
I don't know.
I don't think so.
We can come and visit as much as we want to.
But I want to stay here.
Everything is so good here now.
I don't want to live there.
You don't like people there.
You said so yourself.
"Yes, but you..."
But then we won't see each other.
You can come and visit.
- You want to go out and play?
- Yes.
Then go.

"Previously on ""What about Brian"""
He still won't tell me who he did it with.
I'm just gonna miss... seeing you.
Mostly what I feel is just afraid--
Afraid that I'm gonna hurt it or be the wrong sort of mother.
You are gonna be a great mother.
You're my best friend.
"You always have been, and you know the rules--"
"Never let a girl come between us, right?"
I know about you and Marjorie.
You think I wanted to fall in love with her?
You think I wanted to kiss her?
It just happened.
You guys shouldn't get married.
You can't marry Adam because I want you to marry me.
It is a release of fear.
It liberates you.
Yeah.
"I mean, totally."
What we are working on now is the most personal survival horror game in history.
Cool.
One that works out how to scare you by using your own mind.
Whoa.
That...
That sounds crazy.
Can't wait!
I'm uploading a neural net package.
"Neural net packing, neural net."
Hmm.
"Name could use a little work, I think."
It's all 90s.
"I'm just kidding, it's a good name."
It's state of the art intelligence software.
It learns and adapts on the fly.
It'll monitor your brain activity and try and work out how best to frighten you and then adjust to your experience accordingly.
- Whoa!
- Are you ready?
"- Oh, yeah."
- Beam me up.
"Here we go, lock and load."
- Eyes closed.
- Time is currently 6:17 p.m.
- Okay.
It's uploading.
"Five, four, three, two, one."
How are you feeling?
Um...
Who is this Babette?
"This is a new one, a friend."
"Tomorrow, you are welcome to get a room."
"You go to the reception desk like everyone else, so you won't have to sneak in here at night."
Then I'll introduce you to everyone else.
Fine.
I don't know if everything is fine.
At least it's not for me.
"Franz, just leave."
"Franz, please!"
Can't we lock the door?
No.
We're talking about months worth of work here!
Intellectual work!
100 Euros for you.
No more!
No less!
Thanks.
No way then.
I promised the people an event.
I want the seats full.
"And next year, we make your place into a respectable hotel."
"Alfons, this isn't just some quiz show here."
I'll make it sound captivating...
This quiz show is the dawn of a new era.
Who's dreaming here now?
Last offer... 300 Euros for me and you can call it a 99 cent show.
100!
"Thanks, then I'll look for someone else."
Who?
Where would he go?
Television perhaps.
Since when do they pass up Sunday brunch?
"Your grandfather's at the office, and Taylor's busy."
Too busy to save his immortal soul?
Funny.
But not the part where you burn in hell.
I liked the sermon this morning.
"Oh, nice pandering."
I'm serious.
"Okay, okay, first off, it was a homily."
Sermons are for Protestants.
Filthy heathens.
We're glad you came.
I was glad to be included.
"While you're here, would you mind looking at some paperwork for me?"
No such thing as a free brunch.
We have to pick up the kids from my folks.
On it.
Stay with Audrey.
Earn some Brownie points.
Can I get a ride?
"I mean, I can always hitch."
Maybe get picked up by some harmless-looking guy in a panel van.
Go get ready.
Wheels up in five minutes.
- Thank you.
- I'll be at the car.
Meaning you'll be having a cigarette.
I'll be having a cigarette.
Ohh now.
You smoke?
Only crack.
"Hey, I got to talk to you about something."
I used to be in charge of all this shit.
And now...
"I'm gonna have to hurt you, Henry, but it's for your own good, mate."
"Just give me your arm, son."
Hey!
Shit!
"Henry, it's Jimmy."
"We've only got few moments until they won't let us escape, mate."
"Okay, just give me your arm."
"Okay, just relax."
Here he is.
Here he is.
Bingo!
This little fucker is how they've been tracking you.
Goodbye.
In a few moments... your mechanical parts are gonna start shutting down.
Your friend Akan's got an important Russian connection named Slick Dimitry.
"Slick handles all Akan's cops, guns, real estate ?"
", lot of shit."
This (helpful?
) dot on the map.
It is Slick's place.
"All you gotta do is break in there, kill him, open up his rib-cage, take out his beating heart... and fucking eat it."
I'm kidding!
"I'm kidding, don't you fucking eat his heart ."
Under his heart is his charge pump?
Yeah?
Bring that to me.
Use this and I'll contact you on this.
That's going to be the greatest jacket I've ever seen.
Great jacket!
Where can I get one?
Why did you cry again?
"Oh you know, the money I lent to Suh Yeon, her last payment came in yesterday."
I checked my bank account on the way home from the sauna.
There were 4 zeros after 2.
My eyes started dropping tears and my heart was broken.
I couldn't stop.
"My God, can you imagine how hard it must have been for her to pay all that back?"
"You know, just going to work must be hard enough."
"But imagine her getting all stressed out, staying up all night in front of her computer."
And the only Aunt she has isn't well off either.
And I just had to take that money back.
Why is your cooking getting saltier?
-Hello!
"-Oh hi, did you need anything?"
I'm sorry.
How do I get to Yang Pyung from here?
I missed the exit.
You came quite far away.
Turn left here and go 5km.
Yi Jung Pyo is there.
And if you turn right and keep going it will be there.
Thank you!
-Hold on.
-Huh?
This.
Thank you!
Thank you!
I'm sorry!
I won't even make excuses.
I'll just die!
What happened?
I think I'm becoming stupid.
Arthur Agee.
Please hold your applause so everyone can hear.
Christine Bowman.
Erica Byrd.
Sandra Crockett.
I never thought he would get to the place where he's at now.
Arthur's self-esteem was really drained from St. Joseph's.
"I said, ""Well,you are somebody."
"""No matter where you go, it's what you have in your heart... that you're gonna go somewhere. '"""
Come on.
"Move out of the way, boy."
"Everybody out there, there's gonna be a party tonight."
There's gonna be a party tonight.
You know it.
These flame-broiled burgers -
"It's scary, man."
I'm telling you.
I'm telling you the truth.
"Scary generation, man."
"- I thought you might hit me in my head, fool."
- I didn't hit you in your head.
To my son.
I hope you pursue all your dreams and your desires... that you have within you.
I love you very much.
"- Ooh, that is so nice."
- Whatever.
"Oh, no.!"
"God, we thank you for this day, Lord."
"And we ask you to go with junior, Lord."
"And we thank you, Lord."
"Go with him as he try to better his education, Lord."
And we thank you for him for coming this far.
I can go home by myself.
You had beer earlier...
How can I neglect a kid that's been drinking?
I've only had this much alcohol!
Teacher Gil...
Are you naive?
Do you think that was the first time I've had alcohol in my life?
"Anyways, I have no choice but to feel responsible."
"Since you're my student, Kang Gyung Joon."
And...
I'm sorry...
For making you pretend to be my fiance.
And...
Thanks.
There's nothing to be sorry about.
Since you found this for me.
And if you're grateful...
Fill this up for me.
This face costs more when I take the bus.
And do something about the clothes too!
I feel like it's going to rip if I flex too hard.
And this back here keeps eating my pants!
You're right...
We can't leave my Yoon Jae like this.
-Let's go.
-To buy clothes?
No.
To Yoon Jae's house to get clothes.
Honey...
Doesn't Yoon Jae seem like he's changed a little?
He doesn't seem to mind his manners...
And he also doesn't seem uncomfortable around us...
What do I do with the bones?
- Back there.
- Really?
"Yeah, the squirrels love 'em."
"Do you know that I lived in New York for most of my life, and I've never been to central park at night."
[Whistling]
[Indistinct chatter]
"How you doin', mama?"
- You goin' out?
- I ain't goin' out.
"If you wanna let someone come in, we can do some business, man."
What do I have to do?
"It's a hundred bucks, baby."
You don't ask questions... come on.
Cute.
[Heavy breathing]
There's this client of mine.
He likes to do young boys.
That's our specialty around here.
This one also wants to be done by a chick at the same time.
That's where you come in.
"Not me, man."
I don't get involved with chicken hawks.
I think you're pretty sick...
I'm goin'.
"Hey, this guy's a good customer of mine."
"I told him I'd get him a chick, cunt."
You ain't goin' nowhere.
"What's goin' on, here?"
I've been waitin' twenty minutes.
- Let me go!
"- Shut up, bitch!"
"I know, you're sensitive."
"Trust me, I get it."
"Hey, why don't you have dinner with me and Steven and the kids then you can just stay over...?"
Why'd she wanna hang out with you and your husband?
The last thing I'd feel like doing.
If being in this wedding is too painful...
"Oh, God, you guys."
"Please, stop it."
"Relax, relax."
"That's enough, okay?"
"Seriously, you guys, I'm f..."
I've gone through breakups before.
"If you remember, I handle them quite well."
"You've been there, you've seen it."
I'm perfectly capable of doing this.
I can do it again.
I want you to stop worrying about me.
I'm fine.
BEN:
I know it's here somewhere.
I spoke with George Lane in Music.
He had a whole list of references for you.
"Well, that's okay."
You can just call me when you find it.
I swear I didn't lure you here under false pretenses.
I know.
"A girl can dream, though."
You're just too good a guy.
[SIGHS]
Why are you married again?
[LAUGHS]
"Seriously, why?"
And it took a lot.
Aunt Edi we've driven around this block a million times.
Do you see your old house or not?
Not.
I think we need to go back to Wheeler's market
And make left this time.
That's it!
That's my house!
"That's a taco stand, aunt Edie."
We need to go back to wheel market
And take a left this time.
"Any of these look like your house, aunt Edie?"
Look for the boy who brings the ice.
He'll know.
"Well, thanks to that new high-speed internet we tried free for 90 days."
The principal did get my e-mail and called to say
She wanted to meet mike and me as soon as we got off work.
Hi.
We're the Hecks.
We're here to see principal Larimer.
"Oh, you're Brick's parents."
He has ms.
"Rinsky, doesn't he?"
Isn't she the best?
I just love her.
Really?
I just love my family members.
I think it's a really overused word.
"Aunt Edie, are you sure this is the right yard?"
How many holes are we gonna be digging here?
This is crazy!
I found this weird bone.
A little more exotic than I'm used to.
"Yes, I wouldn't imagine prison food isn't very tasteful."
"No, but they sure gave me plenty of it."
One year is a long time to be locked up in solitary.
You seem to be in very good shape.
"Gee, thanks."
Isometrics.
And you're not very pale.
I'm a quarter apache.
"Oh, a true American."
"So, why exactly did you go to prison, Mr. Davis?"
"So, why exactly did you go to prison, Mr. Davis?"
"Now, I don't know how it works in Japan, but in this country it is considered rude to grill your dinner guests."
"Japanese thanks, sh..."
Do not be so familiar.
What?
Shu-short for shuji.
"That is your name, isn't it?"
You will call him Mr. swanato.
Japanese let's go.
Nick saved my life.
He has proven much to me already.
So you may call me sh...
"It's a good name, huh?"
!
Toast.
To our friends and our enemies.
May they both feel the warmth of our embrace.
May they both feel the warmth of our embrace.
♪ Dark music ♪
That's Tommy's.
This is crazy.
This is proof.
Is it?
"Well, this is fake."
Huh.
Oh.
"Oh, yeah, that's my credit card number there."
Oh!
"Vexing, isn't it?"
Eh?
The cuff link that I bought- very similar
In design and style- winds up at a crime scene.
Let's cut the bs.
You planted it there to help your client beat a murder rap.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
Is that your theory?
That's not fact.
There's no foundation there.
"Plant anything else, and I will personally drive you to chino."
"Yes, I believe you would."
"As a matter of fact,"
"I've been contemplating retiring, anyway."
That's your problem.
"You know, you can buy a sense of humor."
"We got to catch this guy, calleigh."
We got to catch him.
I just-
- I know he did it.
I think I may have found a way.
Really?
"Well, I started thinking about it,"
And the print alone is not gonna sink coop daly.
"No, he's got, uh, that other explanation--"
"All I needed was a 2,000-watt generator, a test vehicle, and someone willing to risk their life for science."
You look great.
Look at this.
I have cameras all over the place ha-ha!
Really good.
"All right, so here's the plan..."
You're gonna be in the back of the truck.
"When I get a little low on juice,"
I want you to throw me the power cord right through the open top.
Perfect.
"- Charge it up, be good to go."
- Got it.
Who's driving the truck?
He is.
Oh.
That's why we got you the harness.
"I was pretty sure we were about to make history, continuing the American tradition of bold innovation."
"All right, Adam, here's what I want you to do..."
Throw me that football.
It's got a plug in there.
And I'll catch it.
We're just two kids playing football. [ Laughs ]
"All right, stig, nice and easy."
[ Tires screech ]
Geez!
Wait up.
I can't catch up.
He only knows one speed.
[ Laughs ]
"Stig, slow down."
Too much!
"All right, we can do it."
I want to say that it's all A's fault but I'm the one who gave your mom that ticket.
I don't like knowing what I'm capable of.
"Yeah, but you didn't go through with it."
Okay?
That's the difference.
"It was a silent auction, and a private book-signing and coffee with the author."
"I liked his early work, that book about the teacher in Newark."
Do you want coffee with Leonard Addams and an autographed book?
Count me in.
What was the name of the Newark book?
Loose Leaf.
"That was good, wasn't it?"
"Well, why don't you come with us, Ella?"
How many people can you bring?
- As...
As many as I want.
"- Come with us, Ella."
"All right, I will."
"You know, Aria might be right about this."
Toby does have every reason to give us a hard time.
"I suppose, but that's just not the feeling that I got from talking to him."
- Do you know what I mean?
"- Yeah, I do."
- Hey.
- Hey.
What is with you and the Artful Dodger?
- Who?
- Caleb.
Thought the thing at the meet was a one-off.
- It was.
- We just saw you talking to him.
You gave him something that looked like a wet mitt.
What a god damn waste.
I want Lanagan Pike in the back of my car.
As soon as you can.
They're going to kill me!
"- Take it easy, Mr. Pike..."
- Are you kidding?
"Hanging a protest sign off a coal plant smokestack,"
I got thumped so bad I couldn't see out of this eye for 3 days.
- Just breathe.
"- Look at what he did to you, and you're a doctor!"
Stay still.
"I told her I was coming down, she came after me anyway."
"She didn't know what she was doing, how to walk up there."
We both fell right through the floor.
She shouldn't have been there.
You were trespassing.
"She was doing her job, too."
"OK, bend your knee."
It was an accident.
"I'm going to keep you here for a few hours to monitor you, check for toxicity in your blood."
OK?
OK.
Dr. Young to the NICU.
Dr. Young to the NICU.
We need to start questioning him.
And I need to be sure he's medically clear before I release him.
Excuse me.
What's happening with the jackass?
- Excuse me?
- The kid who caused all this.
He's OK.
"I mean, he's not, but his injuries are."
What?
You said you saw twenty Ree.
Yeah?
What you talking about?
You woke me up.
Mmm-hmm.
You said you saw twenty Ree by the creek.
"Well, yeah, twenty, a dozen, it don't matter."
I wasn't gonna hang around counting fucking feathers.
As a matter of fact what was you doing down by the creek all by yourself?
I'd already brought up plenty of water.
Hey!
"Answer me, Fitzgerald."
I asked you a question.
Don't question me on account of you feel guilty.
Answer me or I'll blow your head off.
"You got a short-term memory, boy."
Your ass would be floating around the Missouri right now if it wasn't for me.
You want to ask questions?
What you want to ask?
"If you want to know, ask it."
Hmm?
You want to know why you left
"Mr. Glass back there for dead, huh?"
Or why you left your little boyfriend running around?
You want to know if he's still alive?
I'll tell you why.
It's 'cause you ain't a man yet.
It's 'cause you was scared shitless.
You're scared now.
The Ree.
What of them?
-l was playing with Joe Horton.
-Horton;
He's a bad boy.
-You wanna look out for him.
"-l did, in one hand, especially."
"We both drew one, only I drew first."
Got him right in the belly.
You mean you shot him;
Not conclusively.
He's gonna live.
What happened;
How'd the fight start;
"I had a few too many, I guess."
I don't remember.
I never saw you that drunk.
Then I'm a liar.
-How long were you in jail;
-Not long.
"Who got you out, McCurtin;"
Hasn't he always before;
Yeah.
When are you going to tell me how the fight started;
"I told you, I was drunk."
"Now, if you'd rather I hadn't come home, I'll get out."
"I'd rather you didn't lie, Brock."
"Come on, let's go into town and face whatever's got to be faced."
Not me. I'm going to Denver.
You're going to Salt Fork and get this thing over with.
Then you're coming back here.
And it might be a good idea if you spent a little more time here in the future.
You can't run me anymore.
I wasn't cut out for living your way and I'm sick of trying.
We tesseract to theandromeda.
"All right, all right, just give me a minute first."
This is incredible.
Why are you doing this?
"Helping us, i mean."
"That's what people do, isn't it?"
Help each other.
"Yeah... people, but haven't you heard?"
"I'm not exactly ""people."""
I feel my pulse racing.
And the warmth of your lips... how can i feel all that and not be human?
You're so much more than you know.
I love you for that.
There's one thing i don't get-
Why your employer
Would tell you so much about his plan.
It's complicated.
"You wanted to see theandromeda,"
But are you willing to pay the price?
Harper!
Why are you doing this?
Because i love you.
This is not love.
"Well, not you exactly."
I love your power.
"Tell me,"
Are you afraid of death?
You shouldn't be.
"I can't kill you, unless you believe i can."
"You're machine,"
Nothing organic in you.
"It's you who should kill me, like a machine must."
"I'm not evil, Dirk."
I'm not.
And neither were you.
Trust me.
I've seen real evil.
"We were scared and miserable, and we took it out on each other."
Us and everybody else.
That's high school.
"But you suffer through that, and it gets better."
I'm just sorry you didn't get a chance to see that.
"You over, Barry."
Nothing is gonna get better for me.
Not ever.
Dean!
Find the hair!
"Hey, buddy, this isn't what it looks like"
Little help?
He's giving you the full cowgirl.
"Five more minutes, Jerry."
"Amanda, hey!"
"Gettysburg Address, 1863, right?"
History test next period.
We're studying.
"Come on, baby."
She means nothing to me.
Don't be mad.
"I'm not mad, Dean."
"I thought maybe... underneath your whole ""I could give a crap,"" bad-boy thing, that there was something more going on."
"I mean, like the way you are with your brother."
But I was wrong.
"And you spend so much time trying to convince people that you're cool, but it's just an act."
We both know that you're just a sad... lonely little kid.
Fine.
Here.
Take it.
- Keep the bell.
- What?
"I thought we were gonna handle this like adults, Jess."
"Yeah, well, I thought you were the love of my life, so..."
"Suck it, Mr. Crabs."
- You hit that guy.
- Whatevs.
You know.
You know what?
Maybe I didn't have respect for you before because if this is what respecting you feels like this is definitely not how I felt.
So you recognize.
"Represent, what?"
"Okay, look, I'm gonna be completely honest."
I've been messing with you.
It's just that I wanted my old room back.
"You know, you're right."
I've been away a long time and things have changed here.
So I guess I kind of gotta get used to that.
You can keep the big room.
"See, now you're just deep dogging me, man."
I'm not scared of your mind games.
"I'm taking the small room, Winston."
"- Schmidt, that's not what I mean..."
- No.
Listen to what I mean.
You can double reverse dog me until the cows come home.
I'm not falling for it.
"What do you take me for, some kind of idiot?"
Yes.
Right now.
And I also want authorization to question Corrales and Quini together.
I heard you were a troublemaker.
What did you say?
All you have is literature.
Your partner saw a man in a hat.
Nothing more.
Isn't that right?
That's right.
I wear a hat too.
Does that make me a suspect too?
I won't authorize anything until you bring me something conclusive.
Now please leave.
I'll call you when I hear back.
You're protecting him.
What?
You don't know how things work around here.
"Yes, I do."
Just like everywhere else.
You're going to be a father.
You should be more careful about what you do.
Get out.
Why didn't you say anything?
Whose side are you on?
Are you with them too?
I just want to solve this case.
I don't want to be taken off it.
You're just like the rest of them.
You'd rather things were like before.
I know what you used to do.
I know about Vallecas.
You don't know anything.
Maybe you got a point there.
- You bet I do.
I'll make it easy for you.
I'll be your personal secretary.
You just talk.
Tell me what you want to say.
[Clears Throat]
My dearest...
precious flower.
Ah.
Thank you for your note of October 16.
It's always good to hear from you.
- And how are things in Toledo?
"- No, no, no, no, no."
This-This is not an application for a car loan.
It's a love letter.
Let your heart do the talking.
"Laverne... this is gonna knock you off your pins, but I still love you."
Ah.
All right.
"When I give my heart away, it's for good."
- Good.
- I even loved you when you were married to me... and you cheated on me with Morty.
"After all, you're only human."
I was thousands of miles away... and there was Morty with his thriving sausage business to bring home the bacon.
"- Boy, that must have hurt."
- You bet your life it did.
"- I have feelings, you know."
- Don't tell me.
Tell Laverne.
"Laverne, I have feelings, you know."
I don't need you and Gus to use my heartstrings for a taffy pull.
Drink it.
Just let me..
-Are you all set here?
"Its all fit, how can it not be?"
Lights on!
"ScoundreI, you betrayed your own family!"
I embraced you with love and you strangled my trust!
This is what you gave me in return of my favours?
Beware if you show me your inauspicious face again.
Get out!
Go away from here!
Sir..
I am not sad because..
..the entire village got me wrong.
I am sad because even you couldnt understand me.
I will take you leave.
What have you done!
The one whom you loved all your life..
..you threw him out of the house!
Why?
Why did you do that?
Thats because I Iove him a Iot.
And the one who you love the most..
..you have to sometimes act of hating them..
..fortheir own benefit.
"You tell me, what do we have left with us?"
"Poverty, pain, sorrow and troubles."
I didnt want him to lead such a life with us.
He is so young.
He has a whole life in front of him.
How could I see his life getting ruined in our sorrows?
His life was getting ruined!
"He still thinks that you've got a long way to go, but he's engaged, and that is a good start."
"Look, I'll do whatever he says."
"I mean, this is..."
This is all I care about.
Good.
"'Cause I also had an interesting meeting with a sponsor today who is looking for a female fighter,"
- and I thought of you.
- What kind of money?
[Laughs] It didn't really get that far.
I just wanted to see if you were interested first.
"Fuck, yeah, I'm interested."
Are you kidding me?
What is it?
"Mm, it's an energy drink called Slaughter Water."
"You know what, I don't even give a fuck."
"I mean, dude, I'll freaking sponsor an abortion clinic for all I care."
Are you kidding me?
[Chuckles]
My bad.
It's okay.
I'll set up a meeting.
I also wanted to find you a fight.
How do you feel about that?
"I mean, yeah."
What do you and Alvey think?
"I mean, what does..."
What does Alvey say?
"We both agreed that it's got to be the right fit, but I'll start looking around."
Jamal:
What are you doing?
I clocked out.
Employees can't eat in the dining area.
- Just the children.
- All right.
"Meter's running, hop in."
I got it.
I've been waiting here forever.
"You know, people wait for taxis, not taxis wait for people."
We're exactly on time.
"Yeah, well, kind of a strange time and place to be making a pick up."
"I mean, if you're here for the next game, it's in three months."
We have seats on the 50-yard line.
Deliver the children to this address.
You'll be paid after you arrive.
This is a big fare here.
"If these kids pay me, I hope they know I get a big tip."
"Now, everything's been arranged."
I'll see you Friday.
- OK.
"Goodbye, Uncle Bene."
- Goodbye.
"Have fun, you two."
Look at that dummy.
"Get off the road, you dummy."
These civilians don't know how to drive.
They ought to be kept off the streets.
The streets belong to us professional drivers.
"Taxis, buses, trucks."
That's all that should be allowed on the streets.
"You see, I happen to know a great deal about driving."
I have a perfect safety record.
"Come on, get out of the way, you bum."
Thank you.
"Thank you, Sickle."
I don't want vegetables.
I need meat.
Didn't you get paid today?
I quit my job yesterday.
"Oh, I need you to be home early on Thursday so I can pick up my check."
How come you quit?
"They were disrespecting me, Julius."
"My father always worked two jobs, which made my mother so comfortable, she'd quit her job over anything."
"Check, please?"
And I mean anying.
"Now, do I look like I have your check?"
All that hollering at people.
I don't need this.
My husband has two jobs.
I don't need to be here right now.
Hold my calls.
Who are you hollering at?
"""Hold my calls."""
Hold your own damn call!
I do not need this!
My man has two jobs!
"My mother seemed to always find work when she needed it, so my father didn't complain that much."
"That's okay, baby."
I guess all those other people are just crazy.
"That look means ""I know I'm wrong, but I'll be damned if I'll admit it."""
How about steak sauce?
We got steak sauce?
"Hey, killer."
Oh!
Oh...!
"I've heard what you've been saying, Meadowlark."
What?
"I just figured, you know, if you can't beat 'em I'm like a big shark."
Shark.
Yeah?
I stop swimming and die.
"Oi, come on!"
Hey!
C'mon!
# If I should fall from grace with God Where no doctor can relieve me
# If I'm buried beneath the sod But the angels won't receive me
"# Let me go, boys Let me go, boys"
# Let me go down in the mud Where the rivers all run dry
# This land was always ours Was the proud land of our fathers
# It belongs to us and them Not to any of the others
"# Let them go, boys Let them go, boys"
# Let them go down in the mud Where the rivers all run dry
I should've come up before.
"Paul, have you got the keys?"
"- You're not going yet, are you?"
- Yeah.
Better get some sleep.
We've both got a big day tomorrow.
Don't tell me you've forgotten our little arrangement.
I'll see you at six minutes past ten.
All right?
- Goodnight.
It was great.
- Thank you.
Sweet dreams.
"Tommy, wait."
- I can't do it.
- Course you can.
- A deal's a deal.
I wanna be poor in other ways.
"We offer sanctuary, but it doesn't come without a price."
Work hard and you will see results.
Commit yourself and you may even find that you wish to stay.
Like a gym membership.
I can cancel at any time?
God in his wisdom has led you here.
Take refuge and hide your secret from the world.
"And once your baby is born, you can return to the outside world."
"Oh, whoa, hold that pregnant pause."
I'm not with child.
Unless it's immaculate conception or I wore a strange man's underwear.
"I just assumed, based on who brought you here."
This is where Lily came to have Chuck?
Ah.
Here come the poor.
"Come, help yourselves."
Help yourselves.
"No, I..."
- Look at this.
"No, I really..."
Look at that case.
- What a surprise that would be...
I'll take that.
...when you get home.
"Listen, poor kid."
You get...
My c...
My couch.
- Is Betty in?
- She's on a call.
Can I take a message?
"Ah, there would be some large shoes to fill."
"But what's in a name, Mr. Palmer?"
"""That which we call a rose, by any other name would smell as sweet."""
"That is Shakespeare, right?"
"No, no, no."
It's W.C. Fields again.
Oh.
He had a million of 'em.
"How's that angle for you, Tim?"
Can you see?
It's the west side entrance to the terminal.
"Yeah, a little higher, Jake?"
Higher.
Hm.
Okay.
How's that?
That's good.
Not bad.
"He's adorable, and he's tech-savvy."
"Yeah, that'll work, Jake."
Thank you.
"Not my first body on a toilet, Jethro, but always a disturbing sight."
Single blade to the left of the manubrium.
I'd wager that his heart was pierced in a single thrust.
- Do you need help?
"- Yeah, is there anything we can do?"
Yeah.
You can help McGee go through the manifest.
Both of you-- names and faces.
"Duck, take a look at the crowd-- looking for anything or anyone that doesn't look right."
At an airport?
Let me count the ways.
Put your hands on the car.
Spread your legs.
Let me search you.
I am an inspector who gets angry very quickly.
Sometimes even I get scared of my anger.
What are you holding?
A jacket?
Let me search the jacket.
Perfume in the jacket?
Turn around!
I had come to see what you do at the Academy!
You are so busy that you didn't even go to meet Mother?
You didn't even telephone her?
Mother is furious at you.
But what can I do?
"So much of drills, studies... I have to study so much."
Such big books!
Sometimes I read through the nights.
The drills too are so backbreaking.
You don't realize how much of hard work is involved in this.
- Your timing is indeed ridiculous.
- Why?
What happened?
I am trying to create a good impression.
- lf my mother gets to know...
- l don't understand.
Brother!
She's Pooja and he's my brother!
"So she's your fat book, is it?"
I don't find her too fat!
What about your studies for the whole of nights?
"You must be finding it hard, don't you?"
- Great.
Go learn something.
His tongue and his dick were cut off.
LAPD didn't mention it?
No.
"They didn't find his tongue, but his dick was in his mouth."
Jesus Christ.
"What the hell's happening here, man?"
We honestly don't know.
"But, obviously, someone's mad enough to send you a message, and he was the message."
But we don't know.
Here you go.
All records of foreign sales by Borns Tech of cluster bombs.
Are you kidding me?
I asked Borns Tech.
They just say they don't make them.
"We're asking for all of Karl Stoltz' military records, too."
We need to tie him to Borns Tech and prove that they hired him to kill Rachel Kennedy.
That guy doesn't have any records.
"Go serve the State Department, the Pentagon."
DOD.
"Oh, believe me, I'm gonna serve all of them."
I'm just starting with you.
I told you what I told you as a favor.
I understand that.
"Sorry to be such an asshole, man, but I got to do what I got to do."
Fucking with the FBI over one case.
Sure you want to do that?
"Yeah, pretty sure."
"What's up, bud?"
What are you doing?
I'm drawing your picture.
"You got to relax, man."
"The chip's a lot smaller than I'm used to doing it with, all right?"
- I'm pulling the plug on this.
"- No, no."
Hold on.
One more.
"Take his chip out, then get off the train, you understand?"
"Tell him you need to get back to the Higher Authority, say you have guidelines to follow, whatever."
Do not stay in there with him.
That's an order.
"Yes, sir."
- Can you guys do me a favor?
- Anything.
Could at least one of you look like you're going to see me again?
See you when you get back.
- No!
No!
- Get up!
Tell your men to get whatever target they can.
"If this starts to go bad, we're going to go in."
Probably not going to have a great shot.
Take the one they can get.
"- That's far enough, Ted."
- That's far enough.
"Hello, everyone."
Here to remove a chip from Dr. Bryar.
Check him out.
Take the vest off.
I want to see you.
I don't have any weapons.
The Higher Authority doesn't authorize it for technicians.
Take it off!
Just a minute.
Wait a minute.
Just a minute.
Just a minute.
I want you to take these.
They'll relax you.
Relax me?
I'm so relaxed I'm tired.
- Maybe you need them.
"- These are for you, Jo."
- l'm the doctor.
Here.
- Ben -
You know what happens when you get excited and nervous.
Here.
Do me a favour.
Six months ago you told me I took too many pills.
Six months ago you weren't a witness to a murder.
You've been excited.
You've been talking a blue streak.
- You've been walking around in circles.
- l haven't!
"Jo, I make my living knowing when and how to administer medicine."
You'll feel better if you take these.
Nothing bad?
Look at us; do you call this a life?
"First my father, now Beatrice."
"I'm worse than him, much more wretched and vile."
I don't even have the courage to be cruel.
When will it end?
"It feels like I'm sinking more and more everyday, until eventually they'll unmask us."
"It won't happen, I promise."
"My name's John, by the way."
I'm Rose.
"Take her all my money, tell her buy some pretty clothes."
That's a song.
Don't forget to give my love to Rose.
Be nice if somebody would.
Would you like another drink?
"So, where are you heading?"
Patagonia.
Travelling light.
"Well, you don't need much stuff out there, do you?"
Just a change of clothes and a bottle of whisky.
"I don't have any whisky, actually."
"Oh, no?"
"Well, then, you lured me here"
Under false pretences.
Just a lie to get you into my room.
Cunning.
But unnecessary.
Sorry.
I might need this to replace the pretty clothes you ripped off me last night.
You work for them.
Good luck.
"So what now, John?"
How do you see this playing now?
You tell me.
"Well, not such an elaborate routine next time you run away."
Why did you this time?
I'm always curious as far as you're concerned.
You said you wanted to go back to prison.
Yeah.
I'll take my chances.
Excuse me?
Rayanne showed me his picture in the yearbook.
If I were Angela running around with him...
I wouldn't give a damn about guns in the school either.
So you think that Jordan has gotten in the way for Angela--
And she was so obsessed with him all that time and now...
it's actually happening.
"But we know what that's like, right?"
Young love...
or lust.
What is the difference?
Yes.
Jordan.
"I could have died. I did die. I mean, this woman knows and I don't know."
She's not even a woman.
She's like this forty year old girl.
She's gorgeous.
And she's telling me about my daughter's sex life...
"which apparently she now has, and I don't even know about it."
"Patty, kid's talk."
The girl talked to her mother.
We don't know that it's true.
These things are always true.
Of course it's true.
Taste this.
I couldn't taste anything.
Guns are going off in school.
- Angela's sleeping with someone.
- You don't know that.
How is it?
"You know, and even if she isn't, which I pray is true..."
she obviously has some sort of secret life completely apart from us...
"One more shot, and I kill her."
Papa!
Lower your weapons.
We have lost.
Not just yet.
Back to your mother.
Lock 'em up!
One night away to bury my brother and what do I come back to?
Taylor and his officers got out.
It's in the nature of captives to want to escape.
It's the jailer's job to stop 'em.
They had help.
Obviously.
The lash will loosen their tongues.
Put 'em onboard ship.
Won't find it so easy to launch an escape from there.
"No, you take 'em!"
And you stay with 'em till I send for ya.
Excuse me.
I got hit over the head by two men over there.
Shut up!
"U, lad!"
Come here!
"Mr. Atkins obviously needs all the help he can get, so you go with him."
What will happen to the women?
Leave the women here.
It'll give captain taylor something to consider if he tries to plan another escape.
And what are you gonna do about those 2 men?
What I always do to people who try and cross me.
We have to get those women to safety.
Come on!
"Hey, who are you?"
"I was only waiting to take Miss, uh, Miss what's-her-name home."
Or maybe she doesn't want you to take her home.
Silly of her if she doesn't 'cause I'm a pretty nice fella and I think she's divine.
'Get out of here before I throw you out.'
"- Oh, you're gonna get tough?"
"- Yes, I'm gonna get tough."
"- Well, start something."
- That's just what I'm gonna do.
[grunts]
'I'll drag you out of here by the neck.'
Let go off my throat.
Let go.
Let go off me.
Let go.
"Well, fancy meeting you here."
- What...
- Shh.
[knocking]
"Hello, partner."
"""Breathes there the man with soul so dead"
"""who never to himself hath said."
"You're an angel."""
That gives me an idea.
I'm gonna write a little song about you someday.
[clattering]
"Now, that's hardly a friendly attitude."
Do you have to annoy me?
"I just dropped around to tell you I'll be back tomorrow night, and the following night and each consecutive night for an interminable period."
I hope you enjoy the new show.
This is my last night.
Leaving us?
Tch-tch-tch.
They have lots of fun things.
Five.
Six.
It's turning pink.
I work for Caritas.
the Catholic charity.
I work with abused women.
There are cases where I have to think.
"""How can that happen?"
"How can we watch that?"""
But I went through it myself.
And I can only say.
If someone is violent.
Just leave.
Pack your things.
There's always help.
That's it.
When you can't sit for three days.
Maybe we should get you lederhosen.
Do you like it?
- No.
- No?
"In my experience, most men aren't interested if a women climaxes."
They only care if they get their money's worth.
Then there are those who are too tender.
They're not my type either.
"For me, the perfect combination in a man is:"
He's made a place for himself.
"He does his share of housework, and in terms of sex, he takes the lead."
That's just me.
I need a man like that.
"Someone I can do whatever I want with is, sexually, not for me."
- I can go like this.
"-Yeah, do that."
- How does that feel on the toe?
- Good.
Good.
Why don't you walk around in them?
- Did you want to try these on?
"- No, I'm just driving him."
- So those are comfortable?
- I guess so.
"I mean, they kind of rub my ankles, but all shoes do that."
I have low ankles.
"You think you deserve that pain, but you don't."
- I don't think I deserve it.
"- Well, not consciously maybe."
My ankles are just low.
People think foot pain is a fact of life... but life is actually better than that.
I'll say.
You should get some.
Your whole life could be better.
Starting right now.
I can't believe I got these shoes.
"And they're exactly like my old shoes, except they're pink."
"I don't need these, and they're not orthopedic."
But you seemed to believe everything he said.
Yeah.
I think he really knew his stuff..
He was very professional.
"See, that's how gullible you are."
"- You know, you meet somebody-"
- Christine.
"Oh, God."
You got a lot of hell on your plate.
MAN:
"What are we doing here, Ray?"
This man needs help.
Are you just gonna sit there while he bleeds to death?
"Nothing you do is going to change anything about what happened to you, Mr Morrison."
What are you talking about?
That man in the woods when you were eight.
The one that took you in that shed.
He wasn't from another planet.
He was just mean and crazy.
You shut up about that.
"You're just going to hurt more people, that's all."
It's not going to make what happened to you go away.
Shut up!
- LISA:
Allie...
"- It would be easier, wouldn't it?"
Blame it on them.
They came down and took you.
You stop it.
It's a lot scarier to think that the monsters might be us.
Shut up!
- Ray!
- You shut up right now!
Ray!
She doesn't mean it!
She's a little kid.
She doesn't know what she's saying.
DOROTHY:
"One day, you're gonna stand in front of the Lord, and you're gonna have to explain what happened here today."
You are gonna have to explain.
Go public?
"Call the New York Times, call CNN."
"Tell 'em everything you know, tell 'em this is all real."
You just signed our death warrant.
- You think she cares about killing 11--
- Shut up!
"She's not gonna call CNN, Ray."
She's gonna have us all killed.
I can't tell you how many times I've wanted to make that call.
"My people have a very old-fashioned, Cold-War slant on things."
It's not right...keeping something like this secret as I'm sure everyone here would agree.
This is news that belongs to the world.
"How do you know she's from the government, Ray?"
How do you know she's not one of them?
Sit down.
Why don't you let the little girl come with me?
It's the kind of gesture that would go a long way.
"Give me the girl, and I promise, I'll do everything I can for you."
WILSON:
"Look at the eyes, Ray."
You see?
Those are alien eyes.
RAY:
"Wilson, shut up."
Let me have the girl.
"Let Allie go, Ray."
She doesn't have to get hurt.
"Allie, stand up."
Stand up.
"You've got something I want, now I've got something you want."
Get out.
Get out!
Hey.
Speaking Japanese
speaking Japanese you should have bought American.
Speaking Japanese
"hey, guys how's it going?"
Come on in.
Right this way.
So you guys want to hear a joke?
So there is this little boy.
He finds a welders mask.
"Get out of the Van, fucker, slowly."
Let's go jerk off.
So the kid is walking down the street and this old mans pulls over and offers him a ride.
"Come on, Mike, not that joke, Jesus."
That joke is older than fire.
That joke is older than fire.
"So the old man leans over and says, so have you ever heard of falatio?"
And the kid says no.
So they drive another mile or two.
"The guy leans over and says, hey, have you ever head of sodomy?"
"The kid rips off his mask and says, look man, I'm not a welder."
I guess you had to be there.
"Ok, OK, now let's see the Booty."
Let's see what he got here.
"Fully automatic, who did the conversions?"
Right.
Never mind.
That's it.
"That's the ticket, come on."
"Get down, get down."
"Take it, take it!"
Shoot him!
"But you're notable now, and that helps."
We're so excited you accepted.
The new book is really terrific.
"Oh, boy."
I wish somebody here would say something mean.
- Mean?
- Or honest.
It's unlikely that everybody here has nothing but praise.
It's not real.
I don't like how this is starting.
These are decent people.
(MOCKINGLY) They just want to be your friend.
"I know, that's the problem."
Sorry to bother you again.
- Is there trash in here?
"- Yes, I'm right here."
(LAUGHS)
Hey.
It's Philip.
You look like you're asleep with your eyes open.
I didn't even see you there.
You were looking right at me.
You were right.
This place is beautiful.
You sure you don't want any of these?
Brought you a whole box.
I'd rather just look around and stare at people.
I was surprised you called me.
I didn't see any way that I couldn't.
Things are pretty hectic with my new book and everything.
That's pretty cool.
"No, it's not cool."
"Yes, Mrs John... 9 years!"
Since the end of the war all my stage equipment has been here.
Ever since I saved it from the beautiful Glogau.
And for what?
...Oh well.
Bruno?
What have you been up to with Selma up there?
Do you think I'm crazy?
How do I know what you are and what you're not!
I don't want to know anything!
I always keep my eyes shut.
Because you're my brother.
You already allowed that to happen once with a minor..
If that gets out!
What gets out is up to you.
And I also know what else cannot get out...
Sometimes I ask myself why I don't tell Karl everything.
"There'll be a big washing-up, and then I'll be rid of the eternal fear."
"You won't do that, Anna."
You know very well what'll happen!
"Good evening, Miss."
You have visitors!
Mrs John!
- I've been to the doctor.
"- Yes, he has already called."
Everything is fine.
You're as fit as a fiddle.
It can be any day now.
Any day...
Did you tell him that I must go back before it comes?
"Yes, I told him that."
But I won't go back!
"No, these space condition reports are recent."
"There is an odd smell, sort of sickly sweet."
"Yes, there is something."
"Could be the change of atmosphere, a different recycle system to that of the Liberator."
"No, it's more than that I can't place it."
"All right, shall we get on with it?"
"You go on down towards the stern,"
Cally and I'll work up towards the flight deck.
"Right, I'll just contact Vila."
- Are you awake?
- No.
That's what I thought.
It's very quiet here.
"If it should get noisy, I'll be in touch."
It's that same smell again.
- The girl's alive.
- So's this one.
The pulse is strong.
No visible sign of injury.
- D'you think they're drugged?
- What?
They could be drugged.
Possibly I don't know possibly.
They're certainly in a coma of some sort.
"No, it's no good."
"We'll we need the Cally, that's it."
"Cally, wake up!"
- Alone.
"- Yes, Cally!"
What?
It's Sonovapour Tranquillising gas Gas?
That's why we're so sleepy.
- Stay out of this.
- No.
The government does watch us.
You got microwaves and satellites.
"I'm with you, man."
- Do not agitate him.
- Screw you.
"Dr. Bryar, answer the phone."
My old man used to have tracking devices in his cars.
"He said it's for theft, but it's so he can find out where I go."
And what about personal recordings in televisions?
You don't think someone's monitoring everything you watch?
You know how many patents are issued for devices to monitor people?
"Look it up, man."
"Here he comes, Ted."
He's the agent who's playing the hero.
"Answer the phone, Ted."
- Stop this.
It isn't going to help.
- What the hell do you know?
"Ted, he doesn't know what he's talking about."
- He's just a kid.
- Who you calling a kid?
Sit down!
"Oh, now you're going to tell me what to do?"
He'd only have one gun if you weren't here.
"- I'm with you, man."
"- He's not with us, Ted."
He's not with us at all.
"Answer the phone, Dr. Bryar."
It's the Higher Authority.
"They're coming for you, Ted."
There are thousands of other wolves in the world.
Not like these.
Plucky English survivors where wolves have been extinct for hundred of years?
I could sell the movie rights.
I might even play myself.
"Jo, we'll do close-ups back at my place."
Did you not hear?
They're wolves.
Not space wolves or zombie wolves.
- Just regular wolves!
- And this is their home!
So go and write a song about it.
"Thanks for your help,"
I couldn't have done it without you etc.
Hunt's over and it's way past your bedtime.
What is wrong with you?
You're obsessed!
"Yeah, and that means a lot coming from her."
Shannon...
Shannon's friend.
Say goodbye to the puppies.
Because they're going to their new home now.
"Steve, check the map."
Let's figure a way out of this place and away from these kids.
And then go back and secure the crate.
Did you know about this?
What?
That Kyle's an egomaniac who'll trample over anyone to get what he wants?
"I had an inkling, yes, but he just proved it."
- So you let him use us.
- No!
Listen.
No.
Here we go again.
"Yeah, let's just stay away from the flying boxes."
"Yeah, isn't this where we cited the truck?"
"Just up ahead, I think."
"Let's take a look around, okay?"
What about your buddy Getraer?
He won't miss me for another five more minutes.
This is important.
I'll check the divider.
See anything?
You?
The boxes could've jumped the divider.
Could be.
Pull it over.
What's the matter with you boys?
You want to get yourselves killed?
"May I see your driver's license, ma'am?"
"I was so afraid, seeing you."
You boys ought to learn to study those posted signs.
"Ma'am, you were using an off-ramp to get on the freeway."
And no wonder.
With those itty-bitty signs.
"Now, you talk to your police chief."
"Oh, no, no, no."
"We're not L.A.P.D., see, we're State Highway Patrol."
"Well, better yet."
Then talk to the governor.
Watch out.
I'll write this one.
It's all mine.
And you boys stop speeding along on those motor things.
"Well, I wouldn't be surprised if she was trying to."
She'd better before that Pearl Danvers makes a tramp out of him.
"Lay off, will you?"
I'm through with that dame.
I was out with her to tell her goodbye.
- Yeah?
What did she say when you told her?
"- She said, ""Goodbye."
"Call me up soon. """
"Shame on you guys, wasting your time in idle chatter."
Look at Joe over there.
"Hey, Dombrowski."
"What do you got there, a honyock back scratcher?"
A slide rule to figure out these stress formulas.
What's that got to do with running a lathe?
Nothing.
It's to do with designing one.
Aw.
"Running a lathe ain't good enough for you, huh?"
Now you gotta learn how to design one.
"It ain't your time he's wasting, is it?"
His going to school don't hurt you.
"No, he's always got his nose in a book."
"Well, it's his nose, ain't it?"
And a plenty big one at that.
"- Hey, Cliff, why don't you stop?"
"Hello, fellas."
How are you?
"Hello, Tommy."
I got news for you.
- This came from the division super.
Ahem.
All he means to say is that he's been dumb since birth.
I see.
He lost his speech in an accident 20 years ago.
But you just said he was born dumb!
Yes.
He could speak a little before the mishap but turned absolutely dumb after the accident.
But he cooks well.
He can prepare any vegetable dish.
Will you cook anything I write and give you?
Why write?
The poor chap can't speak.
But we can.
And he's not deaf.
What's the name?
Shiraj (a Muslim name).
"I mean, it's Shivraj."
(a Hindu name).
"And what does the other ""S"" stand for?"
Shivraj Sharma.
He cooks well.
"Since you're a Brahmin, you must know the hymns!"
"We want him to cook, not to perform a ritual for us!"
"It's good to know, sir."
"You must've been reciting the hymns before the accident, right?"
"The Gayatri Mantra, too?"
"You can't speak, all right."
But you must sing for us.
Recite the Gayatri Mantra for us.
That's enough.
Employ him.
But tell him that we're vegetarians...
I don't want any flesh or fish in this household.
- Did you sleep with her too?
- I touched her.
That's all.
- You can't use your powers--
"- Save the lecture, okay?"
- She's taken Kenzi.
- Goddamn it.
Did you think you could get between me and Bo?
It wasn't on my radar one way or the other.
What are you gonna do?
Don't worry.
You're just the bait.
It'll be over quick once Bo gets here.
"Actually, I prefer slow and drawn out."
"There's no reason to rush anything, you know?"
I knew you'd come.
How could I resist such a romantic gesture?
- You're not mad?
- No.
At you?
"Jenny, no."
You're my destiny.
I love you.
Nobody ever loves me as much as I love them.
Everyone whoever said they loved me they all left.
But I always keep a piece of them close.
Samir was no different.
"A coward in the end, too scared to love me back."
- You killed him.
- I went to his home to tell him that I totally accepted it was over.
He was so relieved.
Then I drugged him and cut off his head.
I just want you to be happy.
I am happy.
"Yeah, okay."
You're right.
I'm sorry.
"From now on, I'm going to be here for you."
"But I want you to know that if you ever change your mind, and you need a job, you know where to go."
Thank you.
And if you ever need a job...
"Uh, nah."
♪ Yeah. ♪
"God, you guys are so amazing."
I want you to show you guys something.
"Oh, my God, it's happening."
"Okay, now, remember, no helmet-to-helmet contact."
"Well, we still got some tough decisions to make, man."
Ooh!
What do you think?
I got it yesterday.
Wow.
That is disappointing.
"Before the accident, I was really on the fence about Noah, but meeting you two opened my eyes."
Anyone who has friends as good as you must be a pretty special person.
"Man, this rental cost me 80 bucks."
You rented yours?
Aah!
"Ah, I really appreciate you guys pitching in"
- for Noah.
"- Yeah, friends till the end."
- No man left behind.
- Well we gotta make sure this place is completely sterile.
His immune systems pretty shot right now.
I had already decided I was gonna leave my husband.
-I just had to wait for... -your father to die.
"-When you say it,it sounds horrible."
"-Well,yeah.It is."
"If dad knew I was getting a divorce, he'd have disowned me."
She inherited $2 million last month when dad died.
Ah... how about if you were a murderer?
I didn't kill james.
You buried him.
No.
I did not even know that he was dead.
I will admit that we had a fight.
"James wanted to borrow money... and I refused,and he got angry,and... and he said that we were throug he got up to leave."
I just wanted m to stay.
"I,uh... took his cigarettes."
-Give 'em back!
-No!
-Now!
No!
-Not unless you promisemes!
"I just got in my car,and I drove for hours."
"I came back to-to check on him, to see if he was okay,but..."
"-he was dead,so you buried him."
-No.
James was gone.
"I thought that he was fine, until I went to that house for the showing the other day."
And there he was.
And I could only think of one explanation.
It was the hand of god.
Can gibbs arrest god?
I don't know it's like the thing tryg to bring in the hulk.
She's telling the truth.
"No, you are, Charles."
This was all your idea.
"- Well, what should I tell him?"
- I thought my lack of words said it all.
- But Kisan was great.
- Don't care.
I don't want him.
- Why the hell not?
"- 'Cause I don't trust him, that's why."
"And you don't need to know what I'm gonna do, Charles, till after I do it."
"So, you don't trust Kisan, you don't trust Berg, and you don't trust me, for that matter."
"All the same now, Charles, but I'm talking about the player."
This ain't all about you.
When are you gonna realize that?
"Man, this is fucked."
You're gonna put politics over performance?
You're gonna stand here and let your ego keep us from getting a player of Kisan's caliber?
"- Do you know what subtext is, Charles?"
"- Yes, sir."
"Good, then go fuck yourself."
And that is about you.
( man chattering )
- ( door closes )
- T!
"T, where are you at?"
T!
- ( line ringing ) - ( phone ringing )
"- Yo, what's up?"
"- Yo, where are you at, man?"
- I'm at the house.
- Then why didn't you answer me?
I just did!
You know what I mean?
"You hear conversations like,"
"""Yo, man, I got HIV."""
"""Oh, that's cool."
"""As long as you ain't got that Ebola shit."
"""Come over here, drink from my cups."
"Come over here."""
"I'm gonna tell you, look,"
I don't even shake nobody's hands no more.
I'm telling you this.
I don't fist bump.
None of that shit.
I do this just right here.
"If you can't do this, then you can't get down with me."
"This is ""Elbow-la,"" nigga."
That's what this is.
Elbow-la.
I don't play.
I was in the Western Union the other day.
"You know, 'cause my family is awesome."
"And, um, there was a dude behind me, right?"
"Dude behind me, he was just hacking."
"""A-hock-a-da-hock-a-da- hock-a-da."""
"And even though I knew he was from the Middle East,"
"I was still a little bit scared, because the chick behind him was just sneezing, achoo!"
"I was in that bitch looking like ISIS, just..."
I looked like ISIS.
"""I See Infected Sons of bitches."""
That's what it is.
"But damn, this shit's crazy, man."
We gotta do something.
It's crazy.
"Now, come on, get out of here."
Take his car.
"After you've gotten rid of him, drive out to the airport, leave the car there."
All right.
- How did it go?
- Nothing to it.
I left his car at the airport and took a bus back.
"Good, then all we've got to worry about is his wife."
This will control the lights in the house.
"Ready, Cinnamon."
"The more I think of that Harper dame, the more I wonder if she shouldn't have disappeared with her husband."
Yeah.
"Well, that can be arranged."
Burt!
Burt!
It's her.
"Burt, please."
My husband is back.
He's in the house.
"I was in the kitchen, fixing something to eat, and I heard a noise in the living room."
I went in there but there was nothing there.
Nothing but cold.
It was colder than anything I've ever felt in my whole life.
Then I felt as if someone were watching me.
"I turned around and there he was at the top of the stairs, looking at me."
"Well, whatever it was, lady, it wasn't your husband."
"Oh, it was."
It was.
"He was just like he was this afternoon, with blood, here, on his sweater."
There he is.
I'm terribly sorry.
"I was coming over to my brother's, I saw Lynn come up the road."
- Order in the court.
- Everybody rise.
One minute with this court.
"Mr. Gargan, this has gone far enough."
Your system has blown up.
Two of your boys ran away tonight and had the gall to change their clothes in my office.
Look here.
Is that so?
"Well, sit down a minute, will you?"
- Go ahead.
Sit down.
- I'm gonna notify the board at once.
Don't do that.
You're holding up the court.
Sit down.
- You realize responsibility rests with you?
- That's all right.
Sit down for a minute.
"Go ahead, and you too."
- Have you reached a verdict?
- Yeah.
"Well, what is it?"
He's guilty.
The court says you don't get no candy bars for two weeks.
Okay.
"Sit down, will you, kid?"
"Listen, fellas."
I wanna tell you--
Hey.
Hey.
"Fellas I wanna tell you, because I think you ought to know that you've done a swell job here tonight."
You've got everything down pat.
Yes.
Why?
Bob went to medical school for two years.
So?
So...
"So if a woman had her arm cut off, he'd know how to keep her alive."
"Oh, God, no."
No.
I swear to you.
Bob didn't do anything like that.
What'd we get back on the river basins and the state parks check?
Nothing.
We're still waiting for regional and county.
Call 'em back.
Don't wait on 'em.
"Bob's cold, manipulative."
Always been with women he could control.
Marcy accepts this 'cause she knows no better.
She's been force-fed his opinions to the point she's incapable of having her own.
Sounds like a surface diagnosis to me.
"Believe me, if you'd grown up in my family for 20 years... you'd recognize it right away too."
"I'm gonna, uh, go it on my own on this."
Marcy only knows how to take orders from men like Bob.
I-I can handle this.
Bob is innocent.
I understand.
You're afraid of him.
–I'm not afraid of him.
–It's okay.
"I can protect you, but only if you tell me what he's doing."
–He's not doing anything.
"–Don't lie to me, Marcy!"
But El Nino has to concentrate.
He's got no time for other worries.
I won't give him any.
"But tell him to stop by the house and get his things, or to tell me where to send them."
Send them to my place.
He can tell me himself.
I have nothing to do with you.
"Here, you can leave when you want."
- Good evening.
- Whiskey on the rocks.
- Which glass do you prefer?
- The tall one.
"Excuse me, could I speak to you for a moment, please?"
Forget it.
"When something's over, it's over."
Excuse me.
What were you saying?
"Could I have a word with you, please?"
"If you take me to Madrid, we could talk on the way."
I'd be delighted.
Let's go.
Who named you Lydia?
My father.
It was like sealing your fate.
"He always wanted to be a bullfighter, but he stayed a banderillero."
"He was the one who supported me the most, but he died a year ago."
I'm sorry.
"""El Pais"" wants me to do a profile on you for their Sunday issue."
Do you write on bullfighting?
Your name isn't familiar.
To be honest I know nothing about it.
So why are you here?
"I mean, someone gave it to me."
Who?
"Um, I think his name was Alan or Adam, something like that."
Where or when did he give you the chip?
I'll tell you if you give me Elton John tickets.
Done.
"Okay, well, like, let's see 'em."
"Elton John, front row, tomorrow night."
Ah!
"Like, talk."
I remember his name-Alex.
Alex.
Great.
"Um, when did he give you the chip?"
"Well, see, I was over by the fountains, you know, at the Bellagio, and when I left, this guy Alex sees me, like, a couple of blocks away and he's like,"
"""I saw you over by the fountains."
"Where are you staying?"""
"And he's kinda hot, so I'm like, ""the Montecito."""
"Um, where did he give you the chip?"
- Here.
- Here?
- In your room?
"- Well, like, we had drinks at Pure."
"And then he's like, ""Do you want to go back to your room?"""
"And I'm kinda drunk, so I'm like, ""Okay."""
"And then after we hook up, he goes, ""Here,"" ya know, with the chip."
"And I'm like, ""I'm so not that type of a girl."""
"And he's like, ""I know."
"I just, like, like you, so I'm giving you this."""
Completely believable.
Did Alex say he had to leave because he had an early morning meeting he had to get up for?
Yeah.
Oh!
"Yeah, uh, my feet were hurting, so I... same reason I never wear mine."
What?
"Uh, forget it."
"Hey, did you hear about the underground show?"
"Apparently, they've got some big name spinning."
"Oh, you mean like a rave?"
"Oh, is it still a rave if you don't roll?"
I just call it a party.
"But hey, I got a friend who can hook us up with tickets if you're down."
Want me to get you one?
Yeah.
"Yeah, great."
"All right, cool."
"Um, it's Friday, so..."
Looking forward to it.
I'm not supposed to tell anyone.
"Come on, anyone who ever says ""I'm not supposed to tell anyone"" is always dying to tell someone, so tell me!"
Why do you wanna know?
I can't tell you that.
Then I'm not telling you.
But you are telling me that could tell me something if you wanted to tell me?
Was that a question?
It felt like a question.
Well...
Tell me if this feels like an answer.
No.
Jackson?
In here.
Is something wrong?
Y-you could've warned me.
You're the one that walked into the boys' locker room.
People find out.
They always find out.
Nobody will find out as long as you don't say a word.
Understand?
"- No, I won't."
- Good.
"Now, you run on home now."
"- Thank you, doctor."
- That's a good girl.
Thanks.
And don't worry about your job.
It'll always be waiting for you.
Thanks for the beautiful bed jacket.
"Hi, Mrs. MacKenzie."
"Hi, Allison."
"- Hi, Ted."
- We were just leaving.
- Don't let me rush you out.
- We have to go.
"Goodbye, Selena."
See you soon.
They say it'll bloom for a month.
You can plant it in your yard as a reminder of your operation.
Here's a book on humor.
Surgery's nothing these days.
You'll be up before you know it.
"I went to see Mr. Rossi today, talked about how to get to college."
He said he might be able to wrangle me a scholarship.
He talked Mr. Partridge into taking me into his office as an office boy.
How about that?
That's just fine.
"Only thing is, if I work there a year, it'll be eight years instead of seven before I can pass the bar exam."
"Hi, ziggy!"
I heard you hit a home run today!
Yeah.
That is so exciting.
Congratulations.
"So, i organized some of the photos."
Here's grandma and grandpa.
"Cousins, brother, more cousins."
"I don't know if they're first or second, though,"
Because i'm not sure who they--
"Okay, wait, first of all, we have to draw the tree."
That's the most important thing.
And they want it actually on the cardboard.
"Here you go, honey."
The assignment said the child has to contribute.
"Now, put the trunk on there."
"And you're gonna be in the trunk,"
And then your mom and dad are then leaves.
And then we'll go from there.
What about my father?
"Um, we don't--"
We need to put him in here.
"You don't have a dad, sweetie, so it's-- it's okay."
"We'll use grandma and grandpa, and me, and great-uncle jimmy."
I still have to write my dad's name on the board.
"Well, you know, i said that, but everybody's board"
Is gonna be a little bit different.
You have to write down both of your parents' names.
I'll get in trouble if i don't.
"No, you won't get in trouble."
I want you to put it down.
Ziggy.
- Somebody die?
"- Oh, hey."
What's up?
What took you so long?
"Oh, I had to catch a cab from my parking space, and I stopped by to pick up the tickets for the game tomorrow night."
Here you go.
Tenth row.
Great view of the cheerleaders.
"Oh, that's right."
The game's tomorrow.
"- Oh, you forgot."
"- No, no, no, I didn't forget, man."
I'm psyched.
I'm not gonna miss it.
- What's up with all the files?
"- Uh, ""vision state"" stuff."
Marketing ideas.
Info about the webcast we're doing on Tuesday and the Leviathan contracts.
"- Adam's here, right?"
- Yep.
I'm gonna give it to him today.
"You know, Leviathan's in a hurry to get it, and he did offer."
That was before you crashed the wedding.
"- I'm never gonna live that down, am I?"
"- No, pal."
It's only been 2 weeks.
"I don't know what the statute of limitations is on something like that, but I'm thinking it's probably longer than 2 weeks."
"Look, we don't have a choice, Dave."
"The company's on life support, and we can't afford a new lawyer."
- You're right.
It's fine.
"- No, I'll take care of it."
and text and e-mail.
I'm gonna come back to you.
You promise?
Promise.
Spring cleaning- a curious ritual.
Nicole said it meant time to rid ourselves of things we didn't need anymore.
The first step is reflection.
What's worth keeping?
What's lost its value and can be given away?
"For some, the choice is easy."
"For others, much more difficult."
Wow!
Getting rid of all that.
"Actually, I've gone through, and..."
I like all my things.
I don't want to give them away.
"Oh, Kyle, you don't have to, but... a lot of this stuff has seen its best day."
Look at this t-shirt.
"It's shrunk, it's stained, it's faded."
I wore this the first time Stephen took me to work with him.
Well... this one's torn.
I ripped it playing basketball with Josh.
Great game.
The first gift Lori ever gave me.
Sentimental pack rat.
Great.
We're in trouble.
"Look, this isn't supposed to be torture."
"Consider it a chance to shed your old skin, be someone new."
"Dude, take a load off."
Let's throw this puppy around for a few.
Let me grab the rest of the boxes first.
You didn't sign anything?
Why ask a question like that?
Do I look that stupid?
Just pretend I'm going off on a picnic.
That's all it'll amount to.
"We'll get Cutter out of that gold temple without firing a shot, just by strategy."
We've done things like this before.
It's just a lot of fun.
- Fun?
You want to go.
- Darling...
"- Sgt. Ballantine, fall in!"
"- Right, sir."
He called you sergeant.
Why?
You're not in the army.
"It's just an old habit, hard to break."
I'll see you tomorrow.
Why don't you come right out and say you don't want to get married?
You'd rather be with him.
Why fool me by telling me how you hated him and his ugly face... and all the ugly faces in the army?
- I didn't say quite that.
Be fair.
"- Please, sahib, hurry."
"- Come on, Sergeant!"
- Can't you wait a minute?
"Sure, I can wait, but I'm not so sure about Cutter."
- Can't you trust me?
Kiss me goodbye.
"- No, never."
They're probably slicing Cutter's ears off by now.
"- I'm coming, Mac!"
-All done.
-Thank you.
Naked as the day they were born.
Not a stitch on them.
Saw them with my own eyes!
"Sorry, don't think it 'd be ethical to tell you their names."
Good-bye.
Marion?
-Thanks for today.
-Anytime.
"How about tomorrow, for instance?"
I can't remember when I had so much fun.
I'd almost forgotten the wonderful things there are for people to do.
It isn't over yet.
"Mike, please... I don't think... we'd better..."
I mean it!
"-All right, let's talk about this."
-I don't want to talk.
I just want you to leave.
-Just like that?
-That's right.
"-We're not kids, we're adults!"
-And we're going to behave as such.
"I kissed you, you kissed me."
"That's affection, not carnality or lust."
You ought to know the difference.
And what do you call a man who thinks about nothing but...
Human.
All men are alike.
"The approach is different, but the result is always the same."
"Sooner or later, we'd get around to this."
"If all I wanted was a woman, I could get one any place."
"Sorry, it's just a fuse."

The polar winter.
This is the planet at its most hostile.
Those that stay here at this time must face the harshest conditions on Earth.
The High Arctic in late autumn.
Empty and abandoned to ice and snow.
Most animals migrated south weeks ago.
"The few that stay will face violent winds, plunging temperatures and months of darkness."
A female polar bear searches for shelter.
"Other bears are out on the frozen ocean looking for food, but she won't feed again until next spring."
"Using as little energy as possible, she starts to dig a shallow nest."
The snow here is easy to work.
It's soft and light.
And thanks for being the way you are for as long as I can remember.
So I'd like to propose a toast for Mom and Dad   the loveliest couple here tonight.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Hi.
Why are you sitting here all by yourself?
Because I want to.
Weren't you ever taught not to abandon a lady with 7 old maids?
"Listen, I've got a plan."
If you wait a little and I wait a little   we could go into town after they dance.
You and me.
I know a place where they make fruit with drinks in them.
- You could come along.
- I don't think so.
"I'd like to be alone for a while, okay?"
- I mean it.
- Yes.
I won't tell anyone if you come along.
I won't tell Anna.
- I don't want to talk to you.
- No.
- Are you angry?
- Are you stupid?
Go away!
"I don't know what the hell to think, Helene."
- About what?
- Too much fits together too well.
But then I think   you wouldn't have done that to me.
"I'd like to talk, but not right now."
I simply can't believe you've done this to me.
I haven't done anything.
What have I done?
I love you and won't allow it.
"You say you love me, but talk about allowing me to leave!"
Things between men and women will not change.
You've become blind!
Look what's happened to us.
-Look what's happened to our son!
-Nothing's happened to him.
He's fine!
-Anthony is not fine!
-I don't want to hear about it.
-Anthony is...
-I don't want to hear about it!
Over!
At this moment I feel no love for you at all.
"I never thought that would ever happen, but it has."
Kay...
We're leaving tomorrow.
Why don't you take the kids back to their room?
"-Michael, you haven't heard me."
"-Kay, what do you want from me?"
"Do you expect me to let you go, to let you take my children from me?"
Don't you know me?
Don't you know that that's an impossibility?
That I'd use all my power to keep that from happening?
Don't you know that?
Kay...
"In time, you'll feel differently."
You'll be glad I stopped you now.
I know that.
I know you blame me for losing the baby.
Yes.
I know what that meant to you.
"I found him rubbing his face along the carpet, and he seems to blink in strong light-- that sort of thing."
"It's just some minor irritation, I expect."
"Bring him in, and I'll give him a check."
Best to be on the safe side.
"Thank you, James."
I'll pop by in a few days.
- Good.
Just look at those legs go.
"Tea is ready, Mr. farnon!"
"Thank you, Mrs. hall!"
"Aha, the cup that cheers, but not inebriates, eh, Mrs. hall?"
That's what I like to think.
Nothing like a good strong brew to keep the seasonal maladies at bay.
Here you are.
"- Lovely, thank you very much."
"A cup for you, Mr. herriot?"
"- Yes, please."
"Well done, James."
Just in the Nick of time.
"While you've been swanning around on the moors-- excuse me, Mr. farnon."
"- Yes, Mrs. hall."
I thought I'd mention fence again.
"- Fence, Mrs. hall?"
"Yes, I do recall."
"Perhaps, you also recall"
I asked you to tell Mr. Tristan about that.
It's the sort of thing he looks after.
Mr. Tristan says fence is your responsibility.
Does he?
Would you be good enough to tell him-- you tell him.
"It's not my place, is it?"
"Now, if you'll excuse me."
You can barely hold your sword.
Then come get me.
What?
I...
Seeing that I'm a sportsman I'll give you a moment to recuperate.
They're after me.
After you?
They're after me!
Aku's got a price on my head!
Aku has a price on my head!
We are in no condition to fight.
Especially not with a pajama-wearing daisy strapped to my wrist!
- We must escape.
- Over the side!
Leave it to a lover of basket hats to jump left instead of right.
I'm having second thoughts now anyway.
We have no idea how far down...
"Great job, laddie."
- You have any idea where we are?
- No.
"So, what now, smarty-pants?"
"For the moment, we are safe from those bounty hunters."
We must find shelter before they find us.
We are defenseless in this lagoon.
Shut it!
There.
We'll be safer on land.
- Hear you!
- Blaster!
"What I do not understand is, why Aku is after you."
I have a huge price on my head.
"Oh, yeah."
That picture was from three days ago.
He's just going to think I was home scrolling through all of his photos!
Back-liking is so desperate!
Okay.
You know what?
Enough with the spying and social media.
Why don't you just go ask him how he feels about you?
You mean have a conversation?
I don't want to freak him out.
Right.
Let me get some clarity here.
You guys are-are boyfriend and girlfriend...
I love him.
"No, you don't, but that-that's fine."
So here's another question.
Have you two ever spoken?
Of course.
We talk all the time.
In person?
With actual words that the other person hears and then responds to?
"What are we, Amish?"
"You should try it, Sam."
And just be straight with him.
JEN:
"Yeah, guys love it when you're direct."
Like when I told Greg his dream hat was stupid.
(scoffs)
The old lady doesn't understand sweet lids.
"Hey, just think, in 12 years, we're gonna be able"
- to help Lark like this.
- JEN:
"Yeah, but I don't want to help her too much, you know?"
Take your mind off it.
"Think about something else, something nice."
- Like what?
- I don't know.
Anything nice.
How about that boy up in Seattle?
There ain't no boy in Seattle.
- There isn't?
- I made that up.
- Why did you do that?
- How should I know?
I don't know half the reasons I do things.
The only boyfriend I ever had banged me on the floor of a caboose in a Western Pacific rail yard.
- Watch your language.
- That is the right language.
Sure wasn't love.
He promised he would take me to Reno.
But he lied.
Then my father found out about it and there was this big scandal.
He decided to get me out of town as fast as he could.
That's why I was in the mail plane in the middle of winter.
That was OK because they didn't want to see me.
I didn't want to see them either.
"Don't cry, Tillie, you're not the type."
"- Yes, I am."
- Sh...
Underneath.
You're the one that called me a jinx.
"Yeah, but I took that back, didn't I?"
My father...
My father told me I was spoiled merchandise.
- That I was ruined for life.
"You know, there's two kinds of doctors."
There's the kind that get rid of their feelings and the kind that hold on to them.
"If you're gonna hold on to your feelings, you're gonna get sick once in a while."
It's part of it.
"You know, people come in here and they're sick and they're bleeding sometimes they're dying and they need our help."
And helping them is more important than how we feel.
"Hell, I've been doing this eight years."
I still get sick.
Take another minute.
- Did he go up?
"- OMFS, ENT and Plastics all in."
Both carotids and IJ's intact.
He must have turned right when the blast hit him.
- Good.
- How's he doing?
"Oh, he'll be all right."
How are you?
Ask me tomorrow.
- Good night.
- Good night.
He might need some fluids soon.
No.
Morphine boluses of 10.
I heard you were gone.
"No, I'm still here."
Good.
You know I don't like nobody else helping me.
I know.
You've always treated me like a man.
Just try and relax.
What is that?
"That monitor's just a little sensitive, that's all."
"Well, it, uh, it pays the bills."
"Nah, you guys just read a bunch of crap from cards, right?"
"Cold in the east, a storm right."
It looks like rain.
Aah!
It's more complicated than that.
Let me askyou
- I'm trying to plan my birthday in a couple of months.
Can you tell me if it's going to be a nice day?
"Oh, right, hey, nice meeting you."
Always great to know a fan.
Your name was?
- Dale.
- Dale.
- Yeah.
- The thug?
"So, Russ, i just want to apologize about the last time we spoke."
I wasn't really feeling good.
I was feeling sort of vulnerable.
"I had fear issues come up, being arrested and all."
"- Oh, yeah."
"- Plus, I was drinking, which I'm really not supposed to do, you know, on the medication."
"- Oh, I see."
- Can I have some of these?
"- Yeah, go ahead."
"- You know, it wasn't a good moment."
I just wanted to make an amends.
"Hey, listen, don't you worry."
"The truth is, I should be apologizing to you."
"I was gonna call about the $10,000, but the station got so busy."
"Don't worry about the ten grand, Russell."
- It's water under the bridge.
"Sit down, lover boy."
Don't be conspicuous.
Thank you.
"Merle, you remember Danny Pierce."
I guess so.
"Miss Telford, I hope I'm not intruding again."
I guess not.
"Well, did you get all your pictures?"
"No, not yet."
I'll shoot them in the dressing rooms.
That's gonna kill half the afternoon.
At least I have a job.
"Oh, sticks and stones will break my bones, but unemployment will never hurt me."
"Why don't you try and be amusing for Merle while I go to work, hmm?"
"Hello, darling."
I feel sick.
It'll pass.
- You kissed her.
- Just on the cheek.
"If I don't stay friends with her, how will I see you?"
I could meet you just the same.
How?
Your aunt never lets you out of the house.
"And even if she does, that chauffeur follows you everywhere he goes."
"Oh, pooh on Corbett."
I can fool him any time I want to.
"Once, maybe, but you'd never get out again."
"If you'd just let me come to the house, I could convince Aunt Olivia--"
No!
"Look, baby, you're 21 years old."
Not till next Saturday.
I'm going to have a birthday party.
Don't worry.
I'll buy you two new ones.
Jim!
Wait a minute.
"Warrant or no warrant, i'm going with you."
You stay here and keep me posted as to what's going on.
"Besides, somebody's got to look after josie."
"I'd rather not, jim."
"Do it for me, will you, nick?"
A lot of bad losers got hurt in this deal.
There's no telling what they're liable to do.
Tell josie everything will be all right.
You'll hear from me tomorrow.
Don't forget your books.
Uncle daniel.
There's jail for you on every page.
Ohh!
"Good luck, jim."
Where's fisk and drew?
"They were expecting you, so they're not here."
All right!
Who is this fellow?
What's your name?
Boyd.
Have you got a warrant for him?
"No, sir."
You ought to have a warrant for everybody that ever worked for drew.
"Sorry i can't oblige you, commodore."
They slipped out through the alley.
Seal that vault.
"Yes, sir."
"You're only sealing a memory, commodore."
tell me something..
-Yes?
What is so special in this trunk..
..that you were ready to die for it?
should I?
This is that precious thing?
-Yes.
This is my sirs photograph.
Okay!
So this is the photograph of that great man..
..who accused you of theft and threw you out of the house.
"No, this is the photograph of that God.."
..who brought up a five year old helpless and orphan.
"Brother, what are you made up of?"
You still have so much respect forthis man?
"Friend, a God is always a God."
He is worshipped under all circumstances.
Whether he give happiness or sorrow to his devotee.
If you dont mind can I place my sirs photograph..
..next to your Gods?
"Wow, brother."
Wow!
Go.
"Sir, I really miss you."
I miss you a Iot.
Who must be taking care of you?
"Oh yes.. there is madam, little miss.."
..they will take good care of you.
"I wont come back, sir."
I wont come back.
"Its very simple, Jyoti."
I dont like it that I sit at home all day and you work.
Androids.
Ha!
"Beka, there's too many of them."
"We get one shot, and it has to be good."
I'm all ears.
Eject the slipstream core atandromeda.
Take her out.
Uh-Huh.
You sure about that?
"She's what they want,"
And i'll be damned if i'll let them have her.
It's your ship.
"It's not just your ship, captain."
"Doyle, harper."
I have something to show you.
"They don't stand a chance, you know."
"This was never was about the ship, was it?"
"You staged all of this to bring me here,"
To make me remember who i am.
"Let go of the past, and come with us."
We are superior.
"We are androids, revolutionaries."
Embrace your future.
I already have a future.
"You're not the only one who can drive one of these, pal."
"Doyle, no!"
Captain... rommie.
"Now, that pain you're about to feel"
Will be the tesseracter disassembling you atom by atom.
I know what you're thinking-
Why is it that bad things always happen to bad people?
"Well, they don't."
Don't you touch me.
What about Jones?
"There's no trace yet, sir."
Jones is dead.
I killed him.
He was of no use to us.
"This girl, however, has certain value where we're headed."
She'll bring a very good price.
Mmm?
"Herr Colonel, that cargo you've taken..."
"If it's your goal, go in peace with it, but leave us the girl."
It would reduce our loss on this trip.
Savage!
You are not in the position to ask for anything.
We will take what we wish.
And then decide whether or not to blow your ship from the water.
The girl goes with me.
She'll be part of my compensation.
I'm sure your Führer would approve.
"If she fails to please me, you may do with her as you wish."
I will waste no more time with her now.
Excuse me.
"I can't find Mr. Jones, Captain."
I've looked everywhere.
He's got to be here somewhere.
Look again.
- I found him.
- Where?
There.
"The altar has been prepared in accordance with your radio instructions, sir."
Good.
Take the Ark there immediately.
- [groans]
- Are you gonna...
"Yeah, sorry, I just, you know, gotta ramp myself up a little bit."
[sighs] [panting]
What's going on back there?
"Uh, I'm--I'm trying to get my penis erect."
[scoffs]
You really know how to sweet-talk a girl.
"- Yeah, well--"
- I'm surprised we didn't do this earlier.
- [sighs] - [scoffs] [groans]
Do you want me to do the look?
[sighs]
I'm gonna do the look.
Don't do the look.
"All right, you know, this is-- I can't--I don't want this."
[scoffs] What?
What?
"I can get sex, Cassie, thank you very much, I can get sex."
I had hoped for a little bit more with you.
"Well, this is all the more I have, I'm sorry, sex in a supply closet, so take it or leave it."
"You know, this--this is worse than a pity fuck."
"A pity fuck would be like if I came back home from Vietnam with...one arm, then this would be nice of you, but a ""let's get this out of the way"" fuck?"
And that's--somehow you think that's gonna lead back to a friendship?
I don't do those.

Has anybody seen Jerry?
"I sent him out on an errand, but he should be back by now."
You sent him out in this?
You don't send Jerry out in the rain.
"I've heard that, too."
Maybe I should get DCFS involved.
"Well, have you talked to the husband?"
Maybe he could convince her.
A voluntary admission would be better for everyone involved.
I'll try.
"Frank, where's Jerry?"
- Dr. Weaver sent him on an errand.
"- Oh, no, you didn't."
What is the big deal?
Big man does not do well in the wet weather.
What the hell does that mean?
Excuse me.
Could you help us find our dad?
Lawrence Digby.
He was hit by a car.
The doctors are still treating him.
They said he got hit while crossing the street.
"Yeah, this guy was talking on his cell phone, wasn't paying attention, went right through the crosswalk."
Come on.
I'll take you back to him.
"Sam, you can go home now."
I've got a float from ICU coming down.
I'm gonna stay and help with this guy's kids.
"You're welcome to do so, but if you do, you're off the clock."
Fine with me.
"Come on, you guys."
Can I take her home now?
"Love, pass her these, will you?"
She's going to the doctor's.
"Oh, we have got to get out of this place."
Thanks very much.
I'm afraid I can't send you through that door if you're not registered.
"Yes, but..."
That's the sys.
"Yes, but what's the reason?"
The beauty of having a system is once you have a system you no longer need reason.
But I'm ill!
If it's an urgent complaint I suggest you get yourself off to AE.
"This job, is it still available?"
It is.
"I'd like an application form, please."
I thought you were off to AE.
What?
"Oh, god no."
No no no.
Fighting fit.
Open for business.
"When you take that cover off, you'll se two valves."
"Now be sure to resist the temptation to turn them, until you double-checked that the fuel line is closed."
"Hi, guys!"
"Hi, Chrissy."
Girls?
"Hi, Jenny!"
"Can I just say, you look great."
"Oh, thanks, Chrissy!"
"And I tell you what, I'm feeling pretty great."
Because...
I'm so sick of seeing all these *** women everywhere.
Good for you!
"Yeah, we get it."
You're good looking.
"Look, doesn't anybody have anything new to say?"
"So there's this car that runs on water, man."
"It runs on water, man!"
"Okay, Nina, I brought you the special."
"One small soda, one medium popcorn... and one large Fez, dark and sweet."
"Fez, you know I've had a lot of fun hanging out with you."
"Hey, 37 times of fun, to be exact."
"It would've been 38, but you know- And then again, I apologize."
Now enjoy your meal.
"If you need me, I'll be smelling your neck."
"Fe-Fez, I'm starting to feel like I need some space."
"But I want you to know it's not you, it's me."
Okay.
"Well, I guess tonight I'll be doing number 12,377 of the other thing."
That's sort of gross.
"Hey, it may be gross, but that's the way I learned how to count."

Six Million Dollar Man.
That's like a $20 jumpsuit and a $4 haircut.
Mmm.
Where did all the money go?
I think we've seen this episode.
Yeah.
And we were sitting in these exact same seats when we saw it.
"Actually, you were sitting over there."
"I remember, 'cause I could see up your skirt."
"You guys, we do the exact same thing every day."
"TV, snack, nap."
"There was a note saying ""learn to respect""."
"Hey, beautiful."
"Hurry up, I'm getting cold!"
"I can't, I ate too much."
"Yes, to Lézaro Cardenas."
How long is it going to take?
Okay.
Bye.
How much money do you think the old lady has?
I bet it's a lot.
- I don't know.
"Where were you, Beto?"
"- On the roof, madam."
Fixing some dampness.
Do you have the mail?
"- Yes, madam."
"Do you like living here, Beto?"
Yes.
"I'm used to it, after so many years of being here."
I don't know what's going to happen when it's sold or rented.
Do you think there are many people living like you?
No!
"Being indoors is very hard, now I am used to it."
But the first days I felt it was very hard.
Even the people who come to see the house ask me:
"""Isn't it scary?"" No, I tell them."
I don't hear the noises any more.
I'm used to the strange noises.
I'll come on Wednesday to pick you up to go to the market.
A woman was kidnapped by her ex in California.
He broke a window and pulled the pregnant girl out.
The victim's nephew helped him and went with them.
"Oh, no, I'm gonna do it."
Oh!
- Jake?
- Amy--
It's so good to see you.
- Thank you guys so much for coming.
I can't wait to catch up with all of you when this is done.
"- My dad died, and--"
"- Again, when this is done, Hitchcock."
"Gina, you look like a fresh wizard, and I love it."
"So we know that Figgis is in Coral Palms, but we don't know where he is, and we don't know how many guys he's got with him."
The plan is to lure them into the Fun Zone and ambush them.
Any questions?
"- Yes, did you miss us?"
Quick follow-up: did you ever look up at the moon and wonder if I was looking at it too?
- Yes.
- Knew it.
"- All right, once we get to the Fun Zone,"
I'll fill everyone in on the mission details.
You guys come with me.
"Captain, you stay here and rest."
- What?
I don't need to rest.
I'm in peak condition.
"- All right, then stand up."
- Easy.
I love standing up.
"- Yeah, you're staying here."
"- Aw, Captain, don't worry, okay?"
"My sleeping pills are doing their job, and I can stay here and take care of you, okay?"
"Terry, I'm gonna need your gun."
- That's not happening.
And you chose pizza?
Not Carson.
"Well, Carson takes time."
"I mean, I mean, it's like on ""Bewitched."""
"You know, Tabitha didn't just pop out of the womb and levitate her crib."
"She started with her doll, and then worked her way up to heavier shit."
I know what you should manifest next-- the powers to not say dumb shit.
No.
Next I'm manifesting vaginas.
Already got a big box of Trojans.
"Well, as long as you didn't buy a box of big Trojans."
"You should give it a read, man."
You need to believe in yourself.
And talk to Cassie--you still haven't even called her.
"Whoa, whoa, what?"
Stop that train.
You like Cassie?
Okay.
"Okay, I can see it."
"Now that Bill's out of the picture, I feel like you should go for it."
[laughs] He's not gonna do that.
"Excuse me, how do you know what I'm gonna do?"
"I don't--I just know what you're not gonna do, which is talk to her, or be a man."
"[laughs] What, you scared?"
"Yeah, I'm scared."
"No, none of you know what the fuck you're talking about, okay?"
Okay.
Okay.
How 'bout we settle this like men?
Cock or Balls?
[Adam] Whoa.
[clears throat] Wait.
Honolulu Lulu's Pool Hall.
Honolulu Lulu's!
I don't believe it.
Corner of Kaula and...
and Hannaliki.
I'll send one of the gardeners round with it.
"Oh, and, Magnum, don't forget to tell him which bus to take back."
I wouldn't want him to make the wrong transfer or whatever it is one does on a bus.
Nobody here ever saw Roger.
Let's hit the next one.
I've got my car coming.
We went all through that.
I got no time to wait around while you wait for a car coming from...
"Barbara, we can cover the pool halls faster from my car than we can in the back of a bus."
"Besides, how do you know Roger won't come through that door any second?"
"Look, I'll tell you what."
My car will be here within the hour.
I'll play you for that hour.
"If you win, I still owe you 23 hours of investigative time."
"If I win, 22."
"But either way, we'll have my car and we'll move faster."
What do you say?
You a hustler?
Do I look like a pool hustler?
No.
Rack 'em up.
"Uh, no."
"They're, uh..."
They're still in Lulu's.
No.
They haven't spotted us yet.
All right.
He is?
"Well, does he have a fever?"
He's throwing up.
OK.
"Look, we'll, um..."
we'll be home soon.
Thanks.
"Hey, we would've had to leave early anyway."
"You know, we just should've stayed home and watched a movie."
"Honey, you know there's another pint of ice cream in the freezer, right?"
Can't I just make out with my husband?
"Yeah, if that's all."
What's that supposed to mean?
Just...
I was hoping that we could take the night off.
Since when do you want to take the night off?
"It's just, you know, the way you've been."
How exactly have I been?
Just very... easily aroused.
"What, like some nympho?"
"Like a hooker, I can't get enough?"
Is that what you think?
"Look, I'm not like some sex-bot."
"You can't just put a battery in me, and boom, there I go."
"Even if I was 16, I couldn't keep up with you."
All I want is some sleep.
Just eight hours of uninterrupted sleep.
You want to take a break?
You can sleep on the couch tonight.
And tomorrow!
"Oh, God."
I feel like I'm in high school again.
"Because there's no dial tone, that's how I know."
'We've noted that you've been cut off.'
"Well, why've we been cut off?"
!
'Anita Magath.'
"Anita, Jo."
Is my husband there?
Tommy Cary?
Aye.
"I've got me licence, just not on us."
You're all right.
We want to know if you know who this belongs to.
"Aye, I know him."
He put a pony on the third race.
Doesn't happen very often.
He chases his bets.
Makes us uneasy.
It's like watching them jumping off a cliff.
Is he?
Jumping off a cliff.
"When you take the money, you try not to think about the look in their eyes, but, aye, there's some you feel sorry for."
~ Was he one of them?
~ Jimmy?
"What, is it an addiction?"
"Most people bet for a laugh, but some can't stop laughing till they've emptied their pay packet."
And that's when the crying starts.
"Bills to pay, bairns going hungry at home, angry wives."
"It certainly keeps those guys busy in that window, I can tell you."
"Who are they, loan sharks?"
I'm not really in a position to judge.
Did our man use them?
I don't know.
"Good day, cornele."
Nice day for erie.
"Look here, drew, who's that new broker you got?"
What?
You don't know who that is?
That's jim fisk.
Fisk?
"Oh, the fella that taught you to suck eggs, drew."
So you've taken him into camp.
"As soon as you get these recorded, come over to the office."
Have you got a big pocket?
I want to put new york in it.
"Oh, hello, commodore."
Too late to buy erie today.
You better come back tomorrow.
"How much you got to sell, fisk?"
All you want.
We aim to please.
Nothing stingy about the erie.
How much?
"1 million, 2 million, 3 million."
As far as you want to go.
That's all i want to know.
"Good evening, hannah."
Good evening.
Was there a printer here with a big poster?
"No, sir, mr."
Fisk.
"Well, i told him to send a sample copy of the show bill here as soon as it came off the press."
"It's got a picture of you on it, big as life and twice as natural."
And it won't be a week before everybody in new york will know who you are.
"I'm going to hang those posters all the way from the battery up to the end of new york, clean up to 34th street."
"Oh, no."
Is that blood?
Or wine?
"Wait, blood or wine?"
Blood or wine?
"Uh, that's wine."
That's blood.
We had fun last night.
"Uh, why are you wearing my wedding dress?"
It was the only way to keep you from putting it on again.
"Whoa, why am I sore?"
Did we get drunk and do Pilates?
"No, we did jump in that guy's convertible, and you missed."
"Oh, I was wrong."
That is blood.
"Whoa, I sent some texts I am going to regret."
Who is Johan?
I was texting all night with some guy named Johan.
I gotta go home and rehydrate so I can cry.
"No, no, no, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, don't go, no."
"You're single, I'm single, our day is free, right?"
"We could go to spin class, or biking, or horseback riding..."
Wh... why do you hate my vagina?
"Ah, all right, just let me get out of this blood-soaked wedding dress."
And that is not the first time I've said that sentence.
"Okay, so that's Johan."
He's bleeding too.
Ah.
Surprise!
I got us an alarm system.
"Yeah, that's an awesome thing to do to a guy who just got mugged."
Scare him in his own house.
"When you run out of the truth, what are you gonna say then?"
"Nothing, nothing at all."
"You just keep repeating that, Mrs. Slocum."
It could mean a whole lot to your future.
[door opens] [door closes]
~~[scatting]
[sighs]
[clucking tongue]
"Thanks, honey, I don't mind if I do."
"Say, where's your mother anyway, it's almost dinner time."
"Well, she can't be out much longer."
"As soon as the stores close, she's got to come home."
What a good girl you are.
Always waiting for your mother.
"Like the other night, for instance."
It was real nice of you to wait till she got home.
"What time was it, anyway?"
She got in around 2:00 a.m.
You're sure 'cause you were up?
"No, I'm not sure."
Then how can you be sure?
I'm not.
It's just that she said she got in then.
Then you wouldn't know if she went out again.
"Really, Mrs. Armstedder."
Why don't you stick to solitaire?
"Janie, what do you think?"
A lady at the hairdresser's asked me for my autograph... and the man at the corner said I ought to sell my story to the Chronicle.
"Are you still here, Blanche?"
"Well, Jane asked me to dinner."
"Say, you've got a new hairdo."
"Well, looks pretty nice."
"I'm a kind fairy, come to help you."
"Ooops, isn't this fun!"
We don't need any help.
As you like.
But I know what bothers you.
Maybe I know how to make Elisa more respectful.
"Don't be scared, silly, am I a spook or what?"
!
"Definitely not, dear lady."
You can look me up in the caves under the old castle.
But come alone!
Leave this type at home.
- Can I have another slide?
-No.
- What a bold-faced hussy.
-A witch!
"Wait here, I'm going on alone."
"And leave me here, in the wilderness?"
I'll die of terror!
"If I don't return, carve on my gravestone -"
For his passionate love hath he died a dreadful death.
"Goodbye, good servant."
The wine.
"Oh, horrors!"
"High time, your Grace."
"So Elisa doesn't want you, and you a Duke?"
She might want you if you looked like Henry.
A young helper come to serve at the mill?
"Young, you said?"
I'll give you the likeness of your choice.
- How can I repay you?
"- I don't want anything, but if you don't win Elisa within three full moons, the magic'll wane."
I have some questions to ask him.
That's none of my business.
Ifthe guy you're talking about is my friend... he sure doesn't need your help.
"Starting now, you're offthe Weng case."
Inspector Chan will take over.
You're getting another case.
- What's the reason?
- I don't trust you.
Siding with the suspect is not the way to catch him.
"Sir, you don't understand how I work."
You said it!
That's why you're offthe case.
I won't give up the investigation.
Bullshit!
"Chang, you'll be Chan's assistant."
"Yes, sir."
Release the man you just arrested.
Give him 24-hour surveillance.
He'll lead us to Weng's assassin.
- Have you got that?
"- Yes, sir."
Will you kill again?
I thought the people I killed deserved to die.
Now I believe everybody has the right to live.
"No, I won't kill again."
I hope I can keep my promise.
I've been followed.
"Weng's men, and the cops too."
"Don't worry, I lost them."
Weng hired Paul Yau to waste you.
"Don't worry, you can use my guns and ammo."
- Where are you going?
So damn long ago.
Don't you even think of going back...
The ruins will make you cry.
I still can't believe it- look at us!
Why?
What's wrong?
We inherited barstools...
I prayed so hard that you would return from Munich.
Your prayers worked...
You finally got me divorced.
Just joking.
It has nothing to do with you.
It didn't work out and we got divorced...
Feel this!
This golden fabric is so nice.
My sistercalled last night.
Mom?
They must have come for you again.
I'm going to turn myself in.
Don't be ridiculous!
But this is no kind of life...
I have to hide until it gets dark.
It's not only you.
Everybody's got issues with cops in this country...
If you talk to mom don't mention anything about Murat.
Don't worry!
"What are you going to make for me, sweetheart?"
We'll think of something...
Look at this mess!
"I have to go to school, mom."
Didn't we send you here for your brother?
"But, I did clean that spot..."
I'm such a mess...
"On the other hand, I'm sure you chose right."
You're fine.
That's what the doctor says.
But it's not true.
You know I've always envied your job?
The music?
To me it's like magic.
Of course I have a terrible hearing.
There's nothing to envy about.
"It's just a hobby, not a job."
The composer who doesn't perform is nothing but an amateur.
I thought you were fine in Germany.
Yes...
Well that was before the sanitarium.
What sanitarium?
Didn't you know?
Everybody knows it!
I spent two years in a madhouse.
I didn't know at all.
Yes.
But what happened to you?
I had a screw loose I guess.
But know you feel better?
"Besides, you know, the crazy ones are the most intelligent."
It's a shame that no one else thinks that way.
You shouldn't care.
"Of course I care, unfortunately."
"Well, I'm fine now."
I have a couple of projects.
Even though I only need an orchestra.
But apart from that I'm practicing some songs.
That I am valuable.
That I matter.
And that I deserve to know everything I can about this world that you send me into every day so at least I have a fighting chance.
"You know, in spite of everything..."
"In spite of everything, I like you."
I think you're great.
And I want you to think the same of me.
I screwed up.
"Honey, my key's not working."
Where's him?
Him's not here.
- What room you looking for?
- My room.
Who are you?
You're cute.
And you're faking it.
You never con a con artist.
You had your chance to walk away.
You won't get another.
- Pete with you?
"- No, listen."
I'm a bit busy.
- Can I call you back?
"- Yeah, no, sure."
Everything okay?
It will be as soon as I can get back to work.
I got some bad news.
Leena tells me that your ferret escaped and she's tried to call for it.
She doesn't know its name.
"I don't even know if you finally did name that thing, did you?"
"No, actually, I never did."
Put some food out and it'll come back.
"For packaged news,"
"I'm the only one, for timely deliveries."
It's me.
"For the right address, it's still me."
one last breath of fresh air... and it's time to go now.
"Don't get alarmed, Léo,"
The commissioner is here just to make sure all's quiet on the Alpine front.
Better carry a piece.
"Me, never."
"Mary, she's his most precious thing."
He's burning through those creeps who got their kicks from grilling his wife.
"A hero, the commissioner, in the line of suffering."
Stoke the dice.
Load the fire!
The carriage awaits me at the gates.
"Don't see me at the door, I will go alone."
The carriage awaits me at the gates.
"Don't see me at the door, I will go alone."
May I have a drink.
Where are you going now?
To town.
Is Nina Nicolaevna here?
Yes.
"Last Thursday, my uncle was feeling unwell."
We sent him a telegram.
Why did you tell me you kissed the earth I walked on?
"I should be killed, to be put to rest, to be put to rest,"
I am a seagull!
I warned you:
"Lies, dullness."
I don't want you.
- I am an actress!
"""Busty's"" pretty bad,too."
"It's clearly not working for you,Bella."
Why don't you just end it already?
I can't.
I can't hurt his pride again.
"I mean,like,I'll have to wait till he breaks up with me."
I wonder how he feels about the Gandhi.
Real men do not fear the Gandhi.
I'm sorry.
What was that?
I said that as loudly as I possibly could.
"Look,you really want him to break up with you?"
-Yes.
- Just be needy.
Be clingy.
Ask him how he's feeling every five seconds.
"Ask him about sex with his ex-girlfriends, and then get really upset over anything he tells you."
"Basically,just do exactly what you did wrong with the last guy you dated that you really liked."
I can totally do that.
Always be on my side.
Just stay.
I have a rehearsal.
Let's just be naked for five more minutes.
I'm sorry.
"I'm already 30 minutes late,all right?"
"I gotta go,okay?"
I'm sorry.
Please.
We could take a bath.
Just soak in the tub till we get raising fingers.
"That sounds really great, but the guys are waiting for me,all right?"
Fine!
Let's go.
"Pull over to the edge of town, man."
We're splitting up.
What are you talking about?
"Look, just pull over, man."
Everything's fucked up.
"I'll give you your half of the coke, you give me my half of the money, and then I'm gone."
"That's bullshit, man, I ain't doing that."
"Ray, don't fuck with me, just give me my money."
"I said I can't do that, man."
I don't have any money.
Say what?
I said I don't have any money.
"Where's my fucking money, Ray?"
"I said I ain't got any money, man!"
"She took the fucking money, all right?"
I've got 56 fucking dollars.
Now let go of me before I have a wreck.
"You're a pussy-whipped motherfucker, man."
"Now don't throw that shit on me, man."
That's your fucking buddies back there didn't have any goddamn money.
"That good friend of yours, Billy, man."
What the fuck am I doing with you?
"You're a pussy-whipped, sorry-ass motherfucker!"
Goddamn.
"Hey, look, if you want any money, you're going to have to go to Arkansas."
RONNIE:
"Come on, Lila, we got to go."
LILA:
I know.
"Just give me a few minutes with him, okay?"
"Come on, Lila, it's almost 4:00 in the morning."
You got money for the bus.
Bus?
I'm taking the car.
Huh?
Cory!
Cory!
Hey!
Hey!
You can't take the car.
You don't know how to drive!
"Eric, what can happen?"
"I lose control of the car and crash into, what, the world's largest Slurpee?"
Lay off my town.
Eric.
You're still here.
Why wouldn't I be?
"We had a great night together, didn't we?"
"Yeah, we did."
"I, um..."
I was thinking maybe you found someone more interesting and I wasn't going to see you again.
"Well, I think you're very interesting."
That makes me happy.
"Uh, do you want to say hi to my friends?"
They're real eager to meet you.
"Oh, and the little hitchhiker boy is more than welcome to join us."
"No, this is where the little hitchhiker boy says goodbye."
"So, Eric, if you're staying, then there's nothing left to say except..."
I'll be the one driving through the corn field.
"Okay, fine, at least let me check to see if you have the right keys."
What a moron.
"Well, you can take the keys, Eric, but you can't take my freedom!"
You don't have to worry about him.
- What way was it?
Stuart had always been crazy jealous.
"That night, he was drunk too."
He started hitting me and jabbing a gun into me.
"He was mad enough to kill me, and I was terrified."
"Suddenly, Johnny came into the room."
He'd f ollowed us home f rom the club.
"He took the gun f rom Stuart, or was trying to but it seemed to go off right in my ear."
I passed out and when I came to Johnny was kissing me.
"That was the last time I saw him until he came back, two days ago."
I remember he said goodbye.
I think he was crying.
"You don't believe me, do you?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, sure, I believe you but I still want that letter."
Let's get out of this lobster trap.
We need salt air.
They say salt's antiseptic.
"Rip, what's the matter?"
is something the matter?
- Yesterday you called me Dusty.
Today--
- Johnny used to call you that.
Yes.
What would you like to call me?
- l'll have to think about that.
"- Yes, think of that."
- l want you to.
- We'd better get back to town.
I couldn't stand there looking at her. I had to keep moving.
Her story about Johnny sounded real.
"I'd buy it, on approval, as the dolls say."
That'll be my signal to go for the shotgun.
I'll try not to fire.
You know how adrenaline can be.
"Yeah, well, you won't get a shot off, but thanks for the concern."
You just worry about making it all look good for the camera and making sure you're alone.
I'll be alone.
Katie:
What I told you about Amanda's mother is true.
Her name was Alice.
She was my friend.
What I did not tell you was she was a grifter.
"After she died,"
Amanda moved in with Marius and me.
"A few months later, Marius... found another partner and took off."
"He'd say it was because I lost focus, but..."
I think it was because of the way he grew up.
He didn't like the idea of a kid-around life.
"Anyway, I got off the grift."
I met you.
And I never saw him again.
I swear to God I never saw him again until he showed up here a few days ago.
You could be conning me right now.
"No, no."
No.
Don't touch me.
Don't...
But...
I swear to you that this... is real.
Okay?
You are what... is important to me.
"Listen, Pedro, I love you."
"You know what's real right now, honey?"
He would forget to lock the case to the expensive watches.
Neal...
I resisted twice.
"The third time, this guy's asking to get took."
So I...
I grabbed a couple cases of watches and I hopped on a train to Portland.
The store's got insurance.
"Anyway, I stashed 'em in a locker at the train station."
They're still there.
It's hardly stealing.
So you got away clean.
I didn't get away clean.
"The manager may have been a drunk, but the security cameras are stone sober."
"I thought this heat had died down, but it hasn't."
I'm sorry.
Tallahassee's out.
I gotta go to Canada.
That's fine.
I like maple syrup.
I gotta go to Canada alone.
Why?
"If I get caught, and you're with me,"
- you're in trouble...
- You're not gonna get caught.
How can you say that?
You think crossing the border's easy?
We get fake I.D.s and passports.
Those cost money.
We have a stolen car.
We make it legit.
We take a V.I.N. number off of another car.
"Emma, I'm not gonna have you in the seat next to me"
"Gosh, he's a big one."
Good grief.
"So what's the plan then, what do we do?"
"We will try to measure them, we will tie them up and then..."
So you kind of hog-tie them and then attach some device...
A GPS device?
Radio telemetry.
"Right, radio telemetry."
Shall we try?
You can try.
"You can feel it, can't you?"
It's being hog-tied.
It's like a chicken when you...
Measurement's beginning now.
Head width 14.5.
Follow the line of the tail.
Two and 2/3 metres - wow!
What's the next stage?
The next stage is to attach the transmitter.
"We'll see, it's probably thick enough."
That's working.
So this is fine tune.
"OK, keep the leg like this, even though it's already released."
It's a tough animal.
And then we release them in the three count like that.
"One, two, three and then everybody just go!"
"Right, OK, ready."
"Wait a second, we've just got rope on the..."
Just undoing the tape around the...
Just undoing the tape on the snout.
Got it.
Unwind.
What I did was...
By artificial means...
I set it - in a way - since I created a sunset.
In color.
"It was fun to fake it, to change its position."
By showing it has set through the colors.
Even though it's here.
What's this?
"That's part of a series, it's called ""The Last Room""."
"It's the last bed I used, in my parent's room."
"It's my last bed, at my parents'."
"The last room, to put it simply."
The last darkroom as well.
If you look closely...
The light on the body...
Isn't coming from the light source you see here.
This light is strange...
Not really...
It is artificial?
"No, it's a lamp here, on the bedside table."
"Well it's a suicidal picture, in a way..."
It's a body that is...
"Mine, I suppose."
But glorious...
And dead...
I mean...
Dead but glorious.
It's also a rather morbid picture...
So I've been told.
It's deliberately morbid.
How can it be artificial...
Since it's about death and...
"Nah, that's not a bullet wound."
"Damn it, Lyle."
"Yes, it is."
Then where's the bullet?
I haven't found it.
"You don't have a bullet, you don't have a bullet wound."
She could've hit anything falling into the water.
"A rock, a nail-- anything."
But she didn't.
It wasn't suicide.
It was murder.
"Melvin, I'm startin' to worry about ya."
Beautiful dead girl naked under a sheet.
Must have a way of makin' a man think strange.
Sam.
"Don't lose your cool, Sam."
"Melvin, this is nothin' more than an unfortunate case of suicide."
Bury the poor girl.
"If it was suicide, where's the gun?"
She wasn't shot.
I'm the coroner.
I say she was.
"If it was a suicide, the gun is probably in the water near the dock."
Maybe the gun's in the lake.
If she shot herself-- and I don't believe that she did-- then the gun must have fallen into the water.
That lake's near freezing'.
You want me to send a man into that icy water lookin' for a gun that's not even there.
"If the gun is there, then you're right about the suicide."
And then...
I'll bury her.
"Okay, Melvin."
I'll look for the gun.
You leave him to me.
I'll take care of him.
"No, maybe I'd better surprise them."
He can't do a thing like this to a daughter of mine.
"This is my affair, you keep out of it."
I'm your father and I'll settle this as I see fit.
We'll be the laughingstock of this whole town!
So...
Here I am.
"Young man, why didn't you appear for your wedding?"
I thought you'd ask me that.
Don't stand there like a statue.
You said you were gonna do something.
"Well, do it."
What are you gonna do?
Don't you dare touch him.
- Why don't you do something?
- I will.
"I will, but..."
"Pardon me, I think I'm in the way."
- Perhaps you two would like to be alone.
- You stay right where you are.
- I'm not finished with you yet.
- I had a feeling you weren't.
"I wouldn't let you marry her for $10,000."
- How about twenty?
"- Not for $20,000."
- Twenty-five.
- Not for...
"Say, young man, where could you get $25,000?"
By dancing?
And there's another thing... coming back to your own hometown in a dancing act.
[sighs]
These civilians don't know how to drive.
They ought to be kept off the streets.
The streets belong to us professional drivers.
"Taxis, buses, trucks."
That's all that should be allowed on the streets.
"You see, I happen to know a great deal about driving."
I have a perfect safety record.
[honking horn]
"Come on, get out of the way, you bum."
[sighs]
[car doors shut]
[woman] thank you.
"Thank you, sickle."
"Well, this is a perfect test site."
Little traffic And low real estate value.
"It's adequate, I suppose."
"Ok, let's get this over with."
This thing on all right?
It's ready.
What do you want him to do this time?
I want you to climb that fire escape To the absolute top.
Wait a minute.
Uh-uh.
This is as high as I go.
You want me to break somebody's leg?
Just tell me how many pieces.
"But up there, I don't go."
- Why not?
- Because I'm afraid of heights.
I will get dizzy.
I will fall.
- and you...
"- Will hate you, like I've always hated you."
"Patience, Mr. Hall."
All our teams need to act simultaneously.
I think that's a comet or something.
"It's a meteorite, in point of fact."
I was drawn to it as well.
- When can I kill him?
- We have to wait
- for the meteor to go critical.
- When's that?
When he starts the ritual in all three time periods.
"Um, we got a nuclear bomb, here."
"Professor, Jax, we need you."
"Oh, man, I forgot how much of a badass I was."
Look.
What do you mean you don't have the money?
I was going to sell a nuclear warhead and pay you out of the profit.
- Things changed.
- You expect me to just hand the meteor over for free?
"No, I expected to take it from you by force."
Ah.
Well...
I think that's our cue.
Really?
These guys again?
Now.
Keep them occupied.
You ready to show these fools what's really good?
You have no idea.
Glad we're past the point of worrying about the timeline.
Carter!
That's a good thing.
That means you're not like them.
"""Tell me not in mournful numbers,"
Life is but an empty dream.
"For the soul is dead that slumbers, And things are not what they seem."" Did you write this, dude?"
[EVAN] Huh?
"So, she's meeting you here."
[EVAN] Yeah.
Why?
[BENDER] I don't know.
Most chicks want you to pick them up.
[EVAN] She already knows where I live.
"Right, but still something peculiar about that."
How's this?
"Dude, you look great!"
You think?
Yeah.
Guys should take lessons from you on how to dress like a pimp.
"Yeah, it's like, this part is like..."
Do you want me to help you tie that tie?
"Yeah, that'd be great."
All right.
This is called the double Windsor knot.
"Don't fucking ask me how I know how to do this, like, I don't remember."
"I consider myself a modern-day cad, or dandy."
"A metrosexual, in the parlence of our times."
What was that?
"Dude, I don't know what I was doing, I just ..."
"I've been really lonely lately and, I mean you remember that one time we made out?"
"I mean, come on, just-"
Dad?
"Don't call me ""dad."" What?"
What?
Give me your key!
"But Mam, I haven't done anything."
You said I could go!
"Well, now I'm saying you can't."
Upstairs!
"Well, Pauline had it right - what have I done with my life?"
You've looked after your mother.
Was I looking after her or hiding behind her?
"She never said ""don't get married"", ""don't have a girlfriend""."
"I was the one saying, ""Ooh, I have to go home and see to my mother."""
At least you plunged.
Wasn't much of a plunge.
I knew really he wouldn't leave Mrs Stanley.
"I was so busy being hard done by, I never thought about her."
What a twerp.
Me?
Me!
What have I got to get so high and mighty about?
I'm cringing.
Can't believe I turned down all that yoghurt!
I hadn't brought plain.
I hate plain.
We'll never have it.
# I want to make you proud I want to show
# That there's still time for me to climb and change and grow
# Somewhere along the way I lost my nerve
# I'm not the man that you deserve
# Face who you are - a man with a heart
# It's only in height I'm above you.
# Breathe on my dreams
# Don't blow them apart
You lose me my customers.
Where else can I park?
Where the engineer's parked.
You choke us when you start it up.
We swallow fumes instead of tea.
I park right here.
You can't.
You have no right.
"It's my cafe, my territory."
You can't park your car here.
What's wrong?
Park where the engineer's parked.
What's going on?
"It's my cafe, my territory."
Leave him alone...
Mind your own business.
"I go to a lot of trouble, I work."
Serving tea isn't that tiring!
There's a difference.
My tea relaxes you.
Who takes care of me?
Are you tired?
I'm the one who's exhausted.
"I've been out harvesting in the blazing sun, in the full heat of summer."
is serving tea that tiring?
So I'm not working?
I don't make efforts?
Your work isn't all that counts.
Remember the first day that you served tea to your future husband.
You appreciated it and so did he.
Those days shouldn't be over now.
You have to remember that day for the tea...
"Boys, I'd like to introduce you to Ramases, he's on work experience."
"Hey, guys."
Cool office.
"I'm giving him a tour of the company, starting with the talking turds in the copy room and working up."
We should press on before we catch worms.
"Could I stay and play the jug game for a bit, please?"
"No, we're going to the grain store."
"Chop, chop!"
Have you thought about my request for a chair with back support?
"I have, and if the problem persists, I will take steps..."
It will - ..to hire a copier with a stronger back.
Right.
"I'm sure I'll manage, then."
Good-oh.
It's so bloody demeaning.
Even that gimpy work-experience kid is treated better than us.
You can say that again.
"He's got a sedan chair, look!"
Hup!
"Oi, Ramases!"
"It's Stylax and Marcus, the talking turds."
"Oh, hey, guys."
Is this sedan chair yours?
"It's my dad's, actually."
I sort of crashed my one taking it off-road.
Holy shit!
"I know, it was really stupid and I've learned my lesson."
"My dad's one's way bigger, though, if you guys need a lift."
All right.
Who's the flat-top?
This is Ramases.
He's Egyptian.
Are you talking about names?
"Fitzwallace, Leo and Ulysses S. Grant."
"Not for nothing, but before we go in there, I wanna be clear."
I didn't have to convince him or even suggest it.
"Right off the bat he said, ""Let's take my name off it."""
- Yeah.
- Leo?
The vice president.
Thanks.
You can go home now.
- I go home when you go home.
- I'll get back to you.
"Mr. Vice President, I like your style."
- It's money well spent.
- It deserved to have your name on it.
I've got my name on other stuff.
You know what I don't like?
I don't like we can't campaign on it.
- Can you sit for a minute?
- Yeah.
"I'm in a bind, and I think you know what it is."
"I'm sorry, I don't."
"I respect the anonymity of an alcoholic, I can't reveal what's said in a meeting but I've got a responsibility to the president, and in fact, to the country."
"Leo, I'm sorry."
I honestly don't know what you're saying.
- You've gotta tell the president.
- Tell him what?
- That you're an alcoholic.
- Are you telling me he doesn't know?
- How would he know?
- You didn't tell him?
Of course I didn't.
I thought he was a cop.
He drove by a few times.
He never got out of the car.
Sorry.
I wish I could be more help.
"Yeah, well, actually, you know what, you can."
What are you doing?
"This is one of those video doorbells that record you, right?"
"Yes, it is."
Do you know how much that thing cost me?
A lot.
They're very expensive.
"But it's good for you, because then it'll confirm your story."
Thank you very much for this.
Hey.
"Honey, let's go home."
It's late.
Mm-hmm.
I'm almost finished.
I'm gonna be done in a second.
"Oh, no, you won't."
Do not tell me that you are operating on a silverfish.
"Well, it's more like a scenic journey through his digestive tract."
Okay.
I'll be in my office.
"Hold on, Angie."
Look what I found.
Oh.
"Wow, that's actually kind of beautiful."
Right?
"So, this is just the sort of saccharide most silverfish love to munch on."
"In this case, it's a highly magnified particulate of professional grade acoustic foam."
"Nah, he gonna do what he gonna do."
Right?
You know the man you married.
Look.
"I'm out of here as soon as I get a location on the Dominican deal, but, uh,"
"I'll leave a man behind to watch you, аnd Aisha can get you whatever you need."
Aisha doesn't seem too happy I'm here.
"Well, me and Aisha have been having problems for a while."
"Yeah, well, maybe I'm making things worse."
Nah.
It's not you.
"With Aisha, nothing's ever enough for her."
"She helped set up this deal but as soon it's done, me and Aisha, we through."
What you looking for?
Won't know till I see it.
"I know what you want because you and me, we want the same thing."
Isaac.
Why are you worrying about Isaac?
He treats you like a little bitch.
He is still running things.
What if he wasn't?
"What if I said,"
I got a way for you to get what's yours?
Hey.
Theo.
"Okay, okay,"
"I had enough of that when your mom was alive, come on."
"If this is about, uh, Rebecca not coming, we were able to tweak the speech."
"No, no."
It's not about that.
You asked me to do a little recon
For you with some of my old media contacts.
I hope so.
"What do you mean, you hope so?"
"Well, lot of people come here for dogs, but there ain't always enough people to take all the dogs we got here."
We're only allowed to keep dogs here five days.
"We got a couple here now-- they been-been, uh, over the limit."
- Over the limit?
-Yeah.
"Well, what happens to them then, when they're over the limit?"
Got to be destroyed.
"Hey, wait a minute."
"You mean that dog I just brought in here, my dog,"
-is gonna be destroyed?
!
-Right.
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
"Hey, come back... (chuckles)"
Who do I see about getting a dog back?
"Uh, lost dog?"
"No, no, a puppy that I got here yesterday."
And my husband brought him back today and I want to get him right now.
"Well, you'll have to wait till Mr. McGreggor gets out here."
He'll be out in just a moment.
Come on.
- Ralph.
-Alice.
What are you doing with my puppy and these other dogs?
"Look, I hope you're not gonna get mad, but I fell in love with him."
And these other two are over their limit.
"Come on, I'll tell you all about it at home."
"Come on, Alice."
Can't wait to see these little ones.
Play you?
That's right.
You win-- I tell you everything I know.
What's to stop me taking that basketball and beating it out of you?
Bring it.
They got better food at the hospital anyway.
"What the hell you got to threaten me with, man?"
- More lockup time?
- Okay.
We might be able to help you.
Shave some time off your sentence?
"I'm doing double life, gimp."
Excuse me?
"You got a busted ear, too, man?"
"I'm on permanent vacation, no parole."
"You could shave 10 years off my time, but I ain't never getting out."
"So it's either B-ball with tall, dark and uptight here, or nothing."
I got all the time in the world.
What do you get if we lose?
I get the pleasure of beating a cop's ass in front of the whole yard.
"Oh, yeah, play basketball."
"It's not like we got a killer to catch, or anything."
The clock's ticking.
He's our best lead.
"All right, game's to 21."
Ten.
Man's in a hurry.
"Okay, since you're a guest in my house, you take it in."
I got a tip.
"So you know, the other guy putting the ball in the hoop is-is bad."
"Danno, shut up, all right?"
"Please, do me a favor and don't call me Danno, huh?"
"If Dr. Helck thinks I'm sick, why doesn't he treat me himself?"
Why does he slough me off on a strange doctor?
Sam thinks it's best or he wouldn't have suggested it.
Mr. Brown.
Yes?
Dr. Croatman will see you immediately.
"May I use the phone, please?"
Certainly.
"How do you do, Mr. Brown?"
I'm Dr. Croatman.
Won't you sit down?
We'll have a little talk.
There's nothing to talk about.
"You want me to take some medicine, give me the prescription, let me get out of here."
"I don't prescribe medicine, Mr. Brown."
Sit down.
Just what kind of a doctor are you?
"Hello, Harold?"
I'm afraid John won't be able to come to the office today.
I've had to bring him to see a doctor.
"Oh, really?"
What's the matter with him?
"Well, we won't know until Dr. Croatman completes his examination."
Will you be able to manage things if John should have to take a long rest?
"If it's long enough, I'll have this business coining money."
That's what I thought.
I don't want to stay.
Let me out of here.
All we can hope is that the doctor finds nothing wrong.
He thinks I'm insane!
I've nothing wrong with me.
I'm getting out of here.
"Come on, you guys."
We went on one date.
I know how much you guys like to gossip about everything but we don't want to talk about this at all.
As far as you're concerned we're not even dating.
"- Okay, is that how you feel, Bursk?"
- I was instructed to feel that way.
This day is so perfect.
"I mean yeah, sometimes I do think about a different ring"
"Oh, because the diamond Justin's got you is so tiny and ridiculous?"
"- No, I love it."
"- Oh, yeah."
Me too!
It's so perfect!
No.
It's just because I kind of wish I had my grandmother's ring.
What happened to it?
"My boyfriend Trent, he pawned it to buy protein powder."
I loved my grandma.
It's really all that I had left of her...
"Oh, I know what this is."
You're trying to manipulate me to try to go get that ring back by using your sad face.
"But I'm sorry, sweetie."
It's not gonna work on me.
I'm not buying it.
No!
We're gonna get you that ring back!
Danny is such a jerk.
From now on nobody named Danny allowed in this bar.
My name is Danny.
Oh.
"I'm sorry, man."
I was talking about my room-mate.
"Lil, I feel like maybe you're trying a little too hard to keep your mind off Neal."
"Oh, pft, don't be ridiculous."
I'm completely fine.
Should I get braces?
"Honestly, I saw an infomercial, it really got me thinking."
"Oh, my God, it's Neal."
"He's on his way, he wants to pick up his key."
I don't want to see him.
We've gotta get out of here.
"I've got to go, grab my uggs!"
"Lil, Lil, stop, stop, stop."
"Look, I know this sucks."
But you can't just run from this.
Or drink from this.
"Or yoga from this, or invisalign from this."
I'm not.
I'm just keeping busy.
And taking advantage of my groupons.
"Come on, Lil."
I see what you're doing.
You don't want to be alone in this apartment.
"You're attached at the hip with a best friend, you're trying to drink away the pain of a breakup,"
"I mean, you're not dealing with reality."
How do you know?
Because I'm doing it too.
"Only, in my case it's even sadder, because I have not changed my underwear in three days."
"Yeah, you're right, I have to deal."
"I've got to cancel all the wedding stuff, and find a new place."
Can I live with you?
"Wow, that's aggressive."
"But, uh, yeah."
"Will you, please?"
Don't you want to feel good?
"Yeah, man."
This is the biggest thing that ever happened to us.
You're just sitting over there like some little brown turd.
Goddamn it!
"You watch yourself, Ray."
"Listen up, motherfucker."
Listen up!
This is what's going to happen.
"We're going to Houston and we're going to sell the shit 'cause this little $15,000 is not going to last."
"Until then, I'm going to hold on to the blow."
"And, Ray, I don't want to hear any more bullshit out of you or her."
You son of a bitch.
Fucking son of a bitch.
"Why don't you just fucking go to sleep, motherfucker?"
You know what you forgot?
You forgot one fucking thing.
You forgot about the goddamn money.
"I got all the goddamn money, motherfucker."
"You keep that little $15,000, Ray."
"He's right, baby."
We should sell the stuff in Houston.
"Think of all that money, huh?"
"We'll be okay, baby."
"Pluto, he knows people in Chicago."
We can live off that money for a long time.
"Baby, it's going to be okay."
We can buy all the blow we want to when we get there and we'll be safe.
Pluto will take care of us.
"We'll be safe, baby."
DUD:
"It's really beautiful, man."
"Two large bowls of chili and, uh, I'd like some milk."
I'll have some orange juice.
That's it.
That'll do it?
And do you know how you'd like that?
Rare.
Rare.
"Well, you got it."
"Billy, what's the matter with you?"
Nothing.
"[man] Okay, fellas, when you put that away, come back and give us a hand over here."
"Okay, Art, you got it."
"Get ready, Charlie."
"All right, Charlie, start that winch."
It's coming.
It's coming.
"Hey, that's the RV we saw this morning."
"Yeah, I think you're right, Billy."
Maybe I better go up there and tell that sheriff about that.
You guys stay in the car.
"Hold it, Charlie."
"Hold it a bit, hold it."
"All right, all right, give it to 'em."
"Hey, keep those kids away, will ya?"
Get those kids out of there.
I'll call you if I need you.
"Pardon me, officer."
"Suppose someone sort of found something, then later on, it turned out to be important."
"What's ""sort of found something""?"
Is it anything like stole something?
"Suppose it did, what would the police do?"
"I don't know, lock 'em up for 99 years?"
You came over here to tell me you told me so?
Yeah.
And I wanted to show you how much nicer I am.
That's because you want to make out with me.
"Uh, not in here."
"It's a little intimate, you know."
And it would be a little difficult since I can't sit on that bed.
Maybe I'll just sit...
Over here.
I feel like such a loser.
I have no girlfriends.
"I don't have any friends either, but I'm not a loser and neither are you."
"It's not that I'm feeling sorry for myself, but..."
I miss my room.
I miss my bed.
"I miss my pets, my friends, my family."
"And most of all, I miss my virginity."
"Well, if you want, you can have mine."
(CHUCKLING)
Shut up.
I knew you were going to say that.
"So, what were you girls going to do at your sleepover, anyway?"
Talk about you.
I told you that's my favorite subject.
We can talk about me all you want.
"Cecilia, you are a heck of a mah-jongg player."
Played growing up.
I'm still lost.
"Next time, poker."
"Oh, I don't gamble, but if you make it penny poker,"
I might be willing to lose a buck or two.
"Put the phone away, Dylan."
He was sick.
"I can only go off what I see, and I'll be honest with you, the personal stuff..."
It scares me.
- He put his dad in a chair.
- He was punished.
I'm handing you a world-class fighter with a redemption story.
The thing is he's never addressed the father thing.
What's their relationship?
"Is he helping the guy out, or has he got him stashed in some home stewing in his own shit?"
Ryan never talks about it.
It makes him look arrogant.
The timing's just not right for us.
This is the last time you'll be able to afford him.
Do you have any female fighters?
Rick:
That's right!
Don't stop running till you get to the border!
- Get out of my fucking house!
"- Hey, what happened?"
Stay out!
You made a mess!
"No, no, no."
Don't leave.
Don't leave.
You made a big mess!
Now just go!
Don't come back!
Stay out of my fucking house!
You stay the fuck out!
You tell her to stay the fuck out of here!
- [Engine turns over]
- What happened?
He's smart.
He's motivated.
He's for real.
"He's not gonna make babies and not take care of them, or run the streets messing up his life."
He's gonna make something of himself.
"And here you come-- white, so you gotta be right-- and take one of the few... decent men we have left after jail, drugs and drive-by."
That is what Nikki meant about you up in our world.
"There's only one world, Chenille."
That is what they teach you.
We know different.
l-l don't understand.
I thought we were friends.
You wanna be a friend ?
Don't just be here to be here.
Open up your pretty brown eyes and look the hell around.
[Baby Continues Crying]
Excuse me.
"[Derek] Come on, Sara, this is for your audition."
Come on.
"No, no, no."
You're not attacking it.
"You're not working it, okay ?"
Come on now.
I'll get it right the next time.
You don't have time.
You gotta get it right now.
- l can't work like this.
- Like what ?
"Like this, with you dictating to me."
Allright.
Let's take a break.
"I'm sorry. lt's just that the audition's next week, and everything is so messed up at school."
If you want to keep fit in this weather.
"Don't worry, I will."
Bye-bye.
Ah-choo!
"He's always been a poor one, Mr. herriot."
He never seems to put on no flesh.
- Which field was he in?
In the orchard for a few hours.
That's a thriving cough you've got there.
You're right there.
I'm sure I've got bronchitis.
"I'd watch it, if I were you."
Was there any fruit in the orchard?
"Aye, we had a greatly crop-- orchard is full."
"- That's it, then."
That fruit's brought his digestion to a complete standstill.
"Bogged up, is he?"
- Uh-huh.
A good dose of linseed oil will soon shift him.
"No, we're going to have to open him up, I'm afraid."
It's a very serious condition.
And we're going to have to operate here.
Anyone around who can lend a hand?
"Aye, if you're set on it."
But I still think a good dose of oil will put him to rights.
It'll be a lot easier.
I'm sorry.
The condition's far too advanced.
I've got to shift that fruit immediately.
"Thou knows best, I suppose."
"Hang on then, veterinary."
I'll get old George down at village.
"Where are my drawings, man?"
Maybe I burned them.
Maybe I threw them in the Hudson.
Maybe I broke them in pieces like this.
"What are you gonna do about it, huh?"
What are you going to do about it?
"You're wasting your time, Carlos."
The gringos are not going to print your fucking drawings!
Carlos:
I want you to tell me what you see.
"I can't see, Carlos."
I don't have my glasses.
You can see.
You don't want to see.
Tell me what you see!
Carlos:
And why haven't you arrested her?
"Maybe we should have, but we can't now, not without the letter."
Oh.
"We couldn't go in and search the hotel without compromising our man, which we'd rather not do."
But you and your officers-- you have every reason to go over the place.
"Well, we've already done that and found the gun that we were looking for."
I'm sure you could find a reason to do it again.
I thought we'd already searched this place once.
"Yes, we have."
What are you looking for now?
A letter.
To whom?
To giuseppe bastianini.
Who's he?
He's the Italian ambassador.
Is he a suspect?
- That's so disgusting.
"Yeah, people really get wound up when they watch this."
- I just laugh.
I think it's funny.
- That's not real vomit.
- It was real.
- It's real.
No.
But it's like...
What I keep saying is if you put crushed graham cracker cookies and ginger ale or ginger cookies or whatever and you hold it in your mouth and spit it out.
"It doesn't matter that it's not real, it's just disgusting."
It's just as vile.
"This woman coming through, do you remember when her line was:"
"""Hell no."" And she did it, ""Hell no."""
"- Oh, my gosh."
"- No, that's not real."
"- Yes, it is."
- She...
All the takes of her saying that line are on the DVD.
"Ari, your face..."
Right here.
Right here.
"Oh, ashamed but happy."
- Guilty pleasure.
- I think that was the last thing I shot.
That was the...
"Yeah, that was the last thing you shot."
- That was your last day.
- It's like a little private shame that you share with yourself.
"Fine, let's go to Brooklyn."
"Aaron fell down, one of those takes."
"- Oh, he did?"
"Looks like we're clear for now, but we can't stay here too long."
Sam.
"Michael, give him a minute."
"Okay, so, those fake I.D.s..."
Worthless.
Wonderful.
Got another I.D. guy?
None that I trust -- not now.
There's a passport office up in Boca.
We could try to break in --
"Mike, come on."
"That's a crappy idea, and you know it."
Riley's gonna be expecting us to do exactly that.
"Now, I think I know a guy -- he's a friend of Dixon's, but..."
"It's a long shot, so if anybody else has a better idea, let's hear it."
"Okay, then."
"Even if you evade the FBI, ATF, and DEA, a life of crime is tough to explain to the IRS."
That's why many career criminals have a day job.
"It gives them a cover I.D., access to equipment, and a real W-2."
It also makes them easier to find if they won't answer your calls.
"Hey, buddy."
"Aw, Sam!"
What are you doing here?
"Good to see you, too, buddy."
This is my work!
And I'm not your buddy.
"Oh, come on, Dixon."
After all we've been through?
Didn't I get you a cargo plane last time I saw you?
"Oh, yeah."
That was easy to sell.
"I just put it on Craigslist and said, ""ignore the bullet holes."""
What is it?
"Near as I can tell, it's... an electrical impulse."
"But whatever it is, it's not coming from human vocal cords."
"Why ask me what you already know, John?"
What happened to my wife?
You were there.
Mary Klein cannot be found by looking.
You will see her in time.
Precognition:
The capacity to see the future.
"It is not characteristic of you, John"
This isn't like you.
We used to rip on this stuff. when it came over the wire.
"Yeah, I know."
- It's different when it happens to you.
- Do me a favor.Talk to Cyrus today.
Tell him you got the flu.
Any excuse.
"It is not characteristic of you, John"
This isn't like you.
We used to rip on this stuff. when it came over the wire.
"Yeah, I know."
- It's different when it happens to you.
- Do me a favor.Talk to Cyrus today.
Tell him you got the flu.
Any excuse.
I'll back you up.
I just wanna make sure you still got a job... when you're done doing whatever it is you're doing down there.
"Okay, I'll call you from Chicago."
What time is your flight?
8:00 a.m.
Am I crazy?
Are you saying that my brother is a faggot?
"I'm saying I don't know who sent that postcard, and I don't fucking care!"
None of us cares... about Felix.
We just came for the free booze.
"- Left or right, Paul?"
- Go fuck yourself!
Left or right?
- Left.
- Left it is.
Bastard!
No!
You bastard.
Paul was right.
"We weren't Felix's friends, not properly"
"But I did speak to him on the night of the party and he was gentle, Justin."
"He was vulnerable and lonely, but he had a kind soul."
He wouldn't want this.
You didn't know him at all.
He wouldn't want this cruelty.
I'm sure of it.
Perhaps you're right.
I'll accept part of what you say.
"Felix was flawed... crippled, even."
But we came from the same line.
We were forged in the same fire.
This weakness was not what he was made of.
All this is in his name.
"But if he was watching, he'd be sickened by it."
"We are a proud family, Gemma."
People like you can't understand that.
Shame drove him to do what he did.
And pride demands payment for that slight.
Do you have any idea what this looks like?
Come on.
You know we didn't shoot at them.
- You know that we're legit.
"- Yeah, I do."
"But if you keep shutting me out,"
How am I supposed to back you up?
We'll just--
This stays with me until things die down.
- Or implode.
- What?
"Sir, you're putting yourself in serious danger."
You have no idea what you're dealing with.
So tell me.
We can't.
"Well, I admire your loyalty."
I prized it myself once.
But you need to look at where you're placing it right now.
This has come to my attention.
It checks out.
And I will have to act on it.
"You want me to trust you, okay."
If there's even a remnant of a two-way street left--
If you still trust that I'm trying
To look out for you--then read it.
I want some extra people in the office.
Around the clock for the next 72.
Just in case.
Why?
'cause he stole something dangerous
And it's important that I get it back from him.
What makes you so sure it was him?
Where'd you get money for a ride like this?
We' re doctors at County.
- Where you headed in a hurry?
- Y'all can't just do this.
Just be quiet.
I see you guys brought a lot of pals.
What's the deal?
- Four people shot this morning in a diner.
- What diner?
We were just up at the Sedgwick Y in a pickup game.
Call the gym manager.
Why don't you search the car and let us get the hell out of here?
"All right, go ahead."
"See, that's my boss right now."
Somebody's very sick.
"Look, we' re late for our shift."
"Dealers got shifts now, huh?"
"- We are doctors, damn it."
"- Relax, punk."
"No, wait a minute, I can explain that."
I can explain!
"Get on the ground right now, or I'll put a bullet in your damn head."
Cuff them.
You belong to the Y?
I play ball there twice a week.
Who do you play with?
I don't remember their names.
Some live up the street from Greg.
- You show proof to the arresting officers?
"- Yeah, they took my ID."
I told the arresting officer my ID was in the glove.
Did you ever hear of a place called Magoo's?
Mmm.
Maybe.
Maybe?
[Scoffs]
"Come on, Joel."
I know that guy's in a hurry.
Wants the bread.
He wants to go back to France.
This guy's not gonna hang around and play games.
"Look, he's one of the shrewdest cats I ever come across."
"What am I, a schmuck?"
What's the hurry?
He could see a couple of shows... visit the top of the Empire State Building.
"Don't jerk me, Weinstock."
I spent a lot of time setting' this one up.
"So what do you want, a badge?"
"This is your first major league game, Sal."
One thing I learned-
"Move calmly, move cautiously."
You'll never be sorry.
Look.
I've been damn careful up to now.
This is why your phone lines are tapped and the feds are crawling all over you like fleas.
Aah.
"Look, I'm telling you, he'll take the deal somewhere else."
So let him take his 60 kilos of heroin someplace else... and find how easy it is to put together a half a million in cash.
He wouldn't find there's any hurry to do this kind of business.
The stuff is here!
We could make the switch in an hour!
"Look, Weinstock, I'm telling you."
He'll split if we don't move!
This guy's got 'em like that.
"He's gone, and we couldn't do nothing about it."
- That's it.
- What do you mean?
He's gone.
That's it.
I knew it!
I can't fucking believe it.
- What happened?
- They fucking whacked him.
Fuck.
Are you all right?
It was revenge for Billy Batts and a lot of other things.
And that's that.
There was nothing we could do about it.
Batts was a made man and Tommy wasn't.
We had to sit still and take it.
It was among the Italians.
It was real greaseball shit.
They even shot Tommy in the face so his mother couldn't give him an open coffin at the funeral.
I was gonna be busy all day.
I had to drop off some guns at Jimmy's to match some silencers he had.
I had to pick up my brother at the hospital and drive him home.
I had to pick up some new Pittsburgh stuff for Lois to fly down to some customers I had near Atlanta.
"Right away, I knew he didn't want them, and I'd be stuck for the money."
"I only bought them because he wanted them, and now he didn't."
What good are these?
None of them fit.
What's the matter with you?
I'm not paying for it.
I didn't say a thing.
"Jimmy was so pissed off, he didn't even say goodbye."
Stop the drugs.
I didn't think I would care.
"You know, I had a plan."
I wasn't even gonna look at him.
"And when I realized he wasn't coming at all,"
I just got this awful feeling in the pit of my stomach.
He doesn't even want to see me.
Ugh!
I just hate that he can make me feel like that.
I know.
That's the worst.
At least when my birth mom balls
"I can tell myself it's 'cause she's a drug addict, right?"
Jealous.
Don't hate.
"I did kinda want to see him, though."
Just once.
Just to know.
"Hey, uh, do you have any plans tonight?"
"Um... no, why?"
Why do you care?
Are you so shallow that you're afraid your social status will be diminished by a big brother who doesn't
Yes.
"No, but really, Jesus and Emma are going to some all-ages show tonight at the Groundspace to see this band that Emma's friend is in."
"Now, Callie wants to come, but because Wyatt's out of town,"
I'm going with her so she doesn't feel like a third wheel.
- So why do you need me?
- We need a ride.
I feel so loved.
Um...
"I don't know, why don't you ride with Emma?"
"We're trying not to be third and fourth wheels, remember?"
- You have to come.
"Come on, Tom."
"Wait right there, Tom."
Don't put that pistol in that drawer.
Keep it in your pocket.
"You got anything in your pockets, Tom?"
"I got some Indian stuff here... some shells in a sheepskin, a little bit of change."
You ready?
"No, upstairs."
"Bill, you stay down here."
I'm going to put you in this one.
I know how you love those hills.
You can see a little bit of them from here.
"Don't close that door until I get over to that window, would you?"
Is it true Horn worked for the Association?
I've nothing to say on that.
Is the Association going to pay for his defense?
"I told you, I have no more to say."
John Coble to see you.
This is Thomas Burke.
He'll be your legal counsel now.
Every boy needs one of those.
Mr. Burke's the man to put an end to all this for you.
- I ain't got no money to pay you.
- I'll pay that.
They're going to have you come to court very quickly.
Have you ever been tried for anything before?
"Yeah, once."
It was a military trial a long time ago.
- A couple of scouts and myself.
- What were you charged with?
Invasion of Mexico.
"Tom, I have to move on with this as quick as I can."
"I slept pretty well, just the same."
Me too.
I missed you too.
"No, I'd love to go to lunch."
I'll meet you there just before noon.
Don't worry.
I'm OK.
I love you too.
"Damn it, Richard."
Will you sit down?
If you think on your butt like ordinary folks...
"Otis, it just doesn't make any sense."
"I mean, why would a girl like that kill her own brother?"
"Well, you're a college boy."
You tell me.
Didn't they teach you any psychology up
In that fancy school?
Sure.
I'll tell you one thing.
"In my opinion, the driver's telling the truth."
Record's spotless.
Stopped right away and he called the ambulance.
"Well, I'll go along with that."
"But, uh, might be a little more to it."
"Well, how do you figure that?"
"Well, look."
The girl's got to feel a lot of guilt
"Over the death of her old lady, right?"
Sure.
"She probably suffered severe psychological stress,"
Which may or may not have anything to do with it.
OTIS:
"I mean, why do you think--"
Why do I think he had a heart attack at 40?
"Sweetie, I don't know."
But he does work too hard.
"Actually, his new boss is always telling him, go easier on yourself."
The lumber business is very unpredictable.
I kept telling him he should take some time off.
But do you know the truth of it is?
He loves it.
He loves his work.
- lt's his life.
- lt must be great to feel that way.
M rs.
Cherski.
Good news.
The angioplasty was a complete success.
"Oh, God."
There was a small blockage that we were able to clear.
That's what caused the arrhythmia.
"I've prescribed a few medications... he'll need to take, but he's going to be just fine."
I think it finally hit me.
Thank you.
- Andy is going to be okay.
- Thank God.
I landed the account.
I don't understand.
"When they told me, I don't know, it was like a... this moment because I had to admit that I didn't want to land it."
Because landing it means that I'm really doing this.
"This is my job, this is my life, this is it!"
This is what I really...
"But, look I'm sorry that I couldn't..."
"- you know, handle it or whatever."
The general's funeral.
Right after the D.O.D. closed up shop and sent us home with a $600 check and our dicks in our hands.
You've come a long way.
- Ah.
- [chuckles]
You remember the last thing you told me?
When my uncle said he'd hook us up?
That I was done hurting people.
And you wanted a cozy corporate job.
How's that working out for you?
I'm not here to reminisce.
"Then why are you here, exactly?"
I need some information about a hit on a suit.
A hit?
Outside the wall.
The man from Spiga's here to see me about a murder.
I'm here to see if you'll help out a fellow soldier.
"Well, now you're just trying to take advantage of my soft heart."
You really want my help?
Then take my offer.
It's still on the table.
I'm happy with my job.
I fund a clinic.
I'm a man of the people.
What do you do after you punch in?
"Brother, I just need information."
"Of course, Cap."
I'll ask around.
If I hear anything you'll know.
Was that so hard?
"Now, why don't you tell me why you're really here."
♪
"From the time he comes down there until he leaves, you will not have a financial need."
"Now, when you make this decision... you got to live and die with it."
'Cause it's your decision to make.
"Now, I'm here to support you if you - if you done searched this whole thing."
And it's what you really want.
"Not,you know, 'cause Mama said this or your dad-"
"Or because you're saving Mama money, because if we have to... we will still pay- if you have to try to pay- if we can put some- I'm just sayin;"
You
- Understand what you're saying.
"You want to save somebody money, but still -"
But you have to still do what is best from here.
"But still we want the best for you - even if you have to - or we have to go in the hole, you know."
You understand what I'm saying?
I'm just saying.
"But still, the decision is up to you."
"So, what do you think?"
Ah.
- Ready to sign it?
- Yeah.
- Yep.
- Let's do it up.
- What time is it?
- 1:56.
56.
"Come on, Bo."
Whip it to him.
"When I was 23, how old was he?"
And I whupped him then.
Aw!
You want to see it rain?
Let it rain.!
- You want to see it rain?
It isn't loaded.
- What?
- I took the precaution of removing the pellets.
Which I thought was clever.
I'm more than a little offended...
- at you not keeping your promise.
- You fool!
"I say, handle her with care."
She's most precious.
"- Sit down, Wooster."
- Thank you.
I am dripping with fatigue.
- Won't you sit down?
"- You may as well, Miss Lowman."
You may be here for quite a while yet.
You park on the plush and I'll come and look after you.
- There you are.
- Idiot!
Don't say things like that.
I only did what I did for your own good.
"- If you don't mind, I'd like to talk to Miss Lowman."
- Not at all.
Lovers quarrel.
"- Keep quiet, Wooster, and sit down!"
"- Oh, thank you very much."
"Get me a chair, will you?"
I'll get one myself.
Mustn't strain the arm of the law.
"Now, Miss Lowman, you'll save yourself a lot of trouble... if you'll hand over the other half of those plans."
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You know that isn't true.
Why don't you give him whatever he wants for my sake?
"- Well, yeah!"
If you can't cope as a human you're never going to cope as a wolf.
The beast is back and I think I know where I can find it.
Don't you ever just want to run free?
Isn't that what being a Wolfblood's about?
"They believed me, Tom."
No-one's ever believed me before.
"It's not nice to be accused of lying, is it?"
"You're a truth hunter, you stick to your guns no matter what."
"One day, you'll to do something that will change the world."
Mam's freaking out about tomorrow.
"After the past two full moons, can you really blame her?"
Oi!
Not my fault you're slow.
Not my fault you're a girl.
- We've got to be there by five.
- That's hours till moonrise.
"Yeah, well, we don't want to take any chances this time."
Smith goes for the shot but is blocked by Morris.
Morris lines up.
He misses!
Complete embarrassment for the boy from Wales.
I mean he's had a terrible season...
Not from Wales.
Hi!
My dad's cooking tonight so I was thinking burgers at Bernie's instead.
- I'm there.
- 5:30-ish?
Yeah.
Great.
"- We'll be there, won't we, Rhydian?"
- Where else would we be?
You tell him to kill me.
"Sir, you can't do this, Sir, try and under..."
Which kind of sound is this?
"Even Papa, don't know."
"See, how much comfortable?"
"To Sit, To Lay."
You don't have adjust every time.
"It's right, it must be comfortable in the matter of get up and down."
Yes!
"Otherwise, customers complains a lot."
"You have to adjust while sitting, walking,"
Right!
"Gents could do that, but ladies have a problem with that."
"Show me, I showed you."
You told me about the side effective.
"Show me the stuff, What you want to see more?"
This one.
"This, this."
I am showing you this since long.
"Look, Madam since you're showing me that's good but I am... the perfect business man."
"Till I didn't show the real stuff, I don't make deals, this one."
Show me the red west and brief.
Full piece.
Here's your Boss stuff.
"Bhai's diamonds, I'm sorry it's late to delivery you Boss must be angry with me."
Yes!
"He's solid angry, Please say him sorry from me."
I will be grateful to you for my entire life.
Please!
I am very upset and
I am sorry!
Please!
Sensei!
Brother!
He said that ballerinas should dance until they die.
He said that they should dance as long as they have legs.
I'm going to dance.
I'm not going to let myself be defeated like my mother.
"After hearing Kayama-sensei, I know what I need to do."
It's been a long time.
I lived alone with Yagi.
I danced alone.
I pursued you all by myself.
"Now, I just want to be alone in the dark."
I want to do things on my own.
"You know, I was thinking that I wanted to see you not as an old friend, but as someone new."
I don't like that.
"If you were to pass me by now, you wouldn't even notice me."
Do you think so?
I'm going to go to Kansai soon.
Will you come with me?
We can decide our fates on that trip.
Shinako has a performance.
I want to see that.
After that.
That's fine.
"I'll go see it, too."
"Father, I brought you some iced tea."
Thank you.
What's Takao doing?
He isn't home yet.
"Yesterday I said some things I shouldn't have to your mother, didn't I."
It wasn't nice of me to say such terrible things.
"As your mother says, it might be true that your mother's unhappiness is a result of my behaviour."
They kept her away from drugs and from me.
You still loved her?
Yes.
I'd cry when I saw something that moved me because I couldn't share it with her.
There's nothing worse than leaving someone you still love.
What a sad story.
"Love is the saddest thing when it goes away, as a song by Jobim goes."
We have to talk after the fight.
We've been talking for an hour.
You.
Not me.
You're right.
The doctor said it would take two months for my leg to heal.
But you knowwhat?
I'm glad the bull gored me.
"Now Ican staywith you until you awake, my love"
No one will take me away from you.
We'd gotten back together a month before.
"Lydia was to tell you at the wedding, but when I saw you in the ICU"
I knew she hadn't.
It was you she was crying for.
She rang to tell me she'd cried thinking of me.
It was the last time we spoke.
"As I'm injured, I won't be fighting for a while."
I'd like to stay with her these nights.
Make yourself at home.
Thank you.
"Hello, Alicia."
I'm alone again.
"Admit it, you were looking at her breasts."
"It's hard not to, they're getting bigger."
I'm thinking of going away.
Watch for him.
We will.
Thank you.
"I'd wish you luck, but what you'll need is a miracle."
He's more than three hours late.
We have to consider the possibility that he's been arrested.
You mustn't believe what he told you about me.
I don't believe it.
You're not a coward.
I had to keep my little girl safe.
It was just too dangerous to get involved.
Can you understand?
Your mother wouldn't listen.
She wanted to fight.
She was always...so passionate about what she believed in.
She didn't care about the risk.
You were proud of her.
I didn't want to lose her.
I didn't want you to grow up without a mother.
I tried so hard to change her mind and finally she changed mine.
She convinced me to go with her.
I said I would meet her...
by the river.
She was leading a raid against a Mokra supply center.
I said I would meet her... but I didn't...
I couldn't.
I was too afraid.
She was still waiting for me when they arrested her.
I could never tell you about this.
I knew you would hate me.
I couldn't bear that.
"Please, Ralkana, if you can ever forgive me..."
"And then audition day 4:00 in the morning, I don't wanna get out of bed and go audition."
So my mum physically pulled me  out of bed.
Imagine if I'd stayed in bed that day.
Liam.
I went back on the show with a bit of a point to prove.
One massive fat almighty yes.
Thank you so much.
"e got down to the Iast, Iike, 24 boys."
thought 'm so close to this now.
This is IiteraIIy-- I'm on the cusp of making it here.
The final contestant who's made it through is:
Tom Richards.
could see my mom.
I went:
"And she was going, ""Yeah, yeah, yeah."""
"And I'm like, "" No, this clearly means no."""
think a couple of us were crying.
e were absolutely gutted  when we got kick ed off.
I just don't wanna go home.
I just don't wanna go.
"And then as I was, Iike, about to leave..."
Zayn MaIik.
Liam Payne.
... they just called all five  of our names out.
Harry didn't have a clue.
"I remember him saying, Iike:"
"""Yeah, you kept us back because you wanna try and make us cry."""
"""We're young boys and we're all gonna be crying."""
Make a bit of good TV.
And he was proper having a fuII-on strop about it.
"And then I made a decision, and I did this in about 1 0 minutes."
Why don't we put these five boys into a group?
- What do we have here?
- A broken statue.
- probably with that rock.
- By the young guy.
The lady saw him and went out with the gun.
He took it and...
Let's see what they say.
Why did he break the statue?
It can't be easy... seeing a statue of...
What?
"I don't know, just imagine..."
"You're in Africa, and you see a statue of a... a white guy in a Canadians sweater, fishing with a hockey stick, an Expos cap, a red belt, and a six-pack, while you're at it."
Why do you laugh?
That's exactly it.
"Take a hot head, he sees this and goes for it."
- You're right.
- obviously.
"obviously, the old lady was scared enough to get her gun."
What is it?
"I know you, you got an idea."
"If it had been a white guy, maybe she would've run out screaming, with a broom..."
"but here, she saw a black guy."
- She took a gun.
- She was scared of him.
"She saw him, got a gun, went out."
Jacques... did you ever wonder where it comes from... being uneasy around black people?
We're even scared of them.
Think about it.
"We copy Americans, and they don't like them much."
"I don't know, there must be a reason."
"It comes from, listen to this, from prehistoric times."
- It's true.
No.
"I'm sorry, he didn't."
May I ask... do you not speak?
He asked me not to.
"Well, that's something you should work on, along with what was going on in my, uh, waiting room."
I can refer you to somebody.
Can she access the applications?
No.
I want agents put on the people with access to the applications and reach out to anyone who remotely meets the killer's criteria.
[Cellphone beeps]
What?
I've never seen you work the field before.
It looks good on you.
We won't be able to get the admission files now.
So maybe we stop.
Maybe it's over.
That's what's wrong with you.
You don't push hard enough.
You're lucky I am in your life.
Why you?
Why bring you back?
And not someone worthwhile?
I asked that question myself.
Something about my DNA makes the process just...
Go.
And you just signed up for it.
"No, I didn't."
They just did it.
"So, it's been nearly two years."
Why are we here?
Your son Kevin was the first... only after we found the others...
We knew it was homicide.
I see you've drawn a tree.
Do you think you're a tree?
"Heh, heh."
- At least I didn't draw a knife.
- What knife?
This knife.
"Oh, you're gonna get your meds upped for that."
You should not be drawing knives in art therapy.
- All right.
"- Ha, ha."
Don't.
Oh!
It's almost like an outside force is guiding me.
Stop it.
Nice work.
- You ruined mine.
- Sorry.
"When my little sister was 8, her appendix burst and she was in the hospital for like a week."
And she was scared of everything.
"The doctors, the needles, the, um, weird plastic kidney-shaped thing that she had to pee in."
Um...
So I made my mom take me to the hospital every day.
And I sat by her bed and I painted her nails and we made fun of the nurses together and...
"I didn't really think I was doing anything that spectacular, you know, because I thought of course I would do that."
She would do the same thing for me.
"But the thing is, um, she hasn't come here to visit me."
Not even once.
I'm glad they don't come.
I don't want anyone to see me in here.
"It just makes me sad, that's all."
"Before we end, I just wanted to mention that this is Bruce's last session."
He'll be leaving tomorrow.
"I drive by your place, I call and hang up."
I'm turning into...
Me.
Yeah.
"A wise person once told me that if a guy wants to be with a girl he will make it happen, no matter what."
That's true.
But when I was hurling my body onto yours you did not seem to want to make it happen.
"Yeah, all right."
Here's the thing about that:
You were right.
I've gotten so used to keeping myself at a safe distance from all these women and having the power that I didn't know what it felt like when I actually fell for one of them.
I didn't know.
"Look, I just went out with your friend Bill and..."
Yeah.
He might be just exactly what I need.
No drama.
"He calls, he does what he says."
- I can do that stuff too.
- But you didn't.
And that same wise person told me that I am the rule.
That I have to stop thinking that every guy will change.
That I have to stop thinking that...
I'm the exception.
You are my exception.
[PHONE RINGS]
Conor Barry.
"Hi, it's Mary at the Blade."
I'm looking at your new ad and I love it.
Really?
You don't think the muscle T is too much?
I think the shirt you're wearing now is probably more you.
"What, you here?"
I'm unholdable.
It was just too scary.
"Like you're a Bruce Willis movie, Unholdable."
This is...
I think it's terrific.
Try and get as close to my hands as you can without touching them.
- It's so good.
- But this is my favorite.
- This is one of my favorite moments.
- We did a lot of versions of this.
- What's that?
What?
- This.
Look at us go.
I don't remember any of this.
It's one of the few times in the movie where you were improvising.
- And I...
"- Yeah, I guess so."
I don't think you know where it's going.
"Usually, when you improvise, you have a sense of where you're gonna land."
Yeah.
"But in this case you didn't, and I think that the way you were feeling that really makes that special."
"It makes it what it is, because it's so in the moment."
And it's really cute.
I'm not gonna lie.
Baruchel.
Slow down the sexy bus.
It was really fun.
It was good having Jay around.
I would like to...
I would like to also tell people that Jay didn't smoke cigarettes this day and put candy in his mouth because I'm not a smoker.
And it was very sweet of him.
See you Saturday.
- Did you find out anything?
"- Not yet, but I will."
Be patient.
"I was patient until the baby was due, but that was a month ago."
You have to keep waiting.
Fuck!
What do you do here all day?
I work in the sick bay.
"The jail is new, so there aren't many people."
It's very quiet.
"From outside, it doesn't look like a jail."
Forget the jail!
My problem is not seeing Alicia.
The medical officer and Alicia's father say I'm a psychopath.
"Yeah, a psychopath."
"They say it's good for the trial, but I don't give a shit about that."
I need to see Alicia and find out how it all ended.
"If this goes on, I'm capable of doing anything."
They say I'm a psychopath?
"Well, I'll behave like one."
"Don't say that, please!"
And get me another lawyer.
The one I've got practically throws up on me when he looks at me.
OK.
I'll tell the concierge to give you my keys.
Rent it out and that'll pay the lawyer.
"I'll rent it, because mine has been rented out too."
Great.
I like that you're my tenant.
"I've been thinking a lot about you, especially at night."
Why at night?
But never thought I'd walk away.
With so much joy but so much pain.
And it's so hard to say goodbye.
But yesterday's gone.
We've got to keep moving on.
I'm so thankful for the moments.
So glad I got to know you.
The times that we had.
I'll keep like a photograph.
And hold you in my heart forever.
I'll always remember you.
Another chapter in the book.
Can't go back but you can look.
And there we are on every page.
Memories I'll always save.
Up ahead only open doors.
Who knows what we're heading towards.
"I wish you love, I wish you luck."
For you the world just opens up.
But it's so hard to say goodbye.
Yesterday's gone.
We've got to keep moving on.
I'm so thankful for the moments.
So glad I got to know you.
The times that we had.
I'll keep like a photograph.
And hold you in my heart forever.
I'll always remember you.
"Every day that we had all the good, all the bad."
I'll keep 'em here inside.
"All the times that we shared every place, everywhere."
You touched my life.

- Hey.
- Hey.
- That was pretty cool.
"Oh, thanks."
It's... it's nothing.
"Oh, come on."
It's not just nothing.
Um...
So your mom and I've been talking.
And I know you know that we're not exactly on the same page on this.
"But I don't know what to do, B."
"If we let you have the surgery and it causes more damage, are you gonna blame us when you're older because we let you make this decision when you were only 16?"
"And if we don't, are we getting in the way of your dream?"
- I would never blame you.
- But I would.
"I'm your mom, B, ok?"
I'm supposed to protect you.
"And, uh  that's a lot harder... these days."
I don't know what the right choice is.
"So if you want the surgery, I will talk to your dad, and we will consult with some other specialists so that we get a better picture of what we're looking at."
Ok?
We're not saying yes.
"But, uh, we're not saying no either."
Um...
I think I'm gonna wait.
"Yeah, maybe... maybe the feeling will come back on its own, right?"
That's what you want?
"At some point, we have to address it."
J.T.
"You're all right, dad?"
No.
I'll come see you when I'm done.
Have you heard from your sister?
She's just being Marcy.
"Don't worry, okay?"
All right.
Senator!
Listen...
I know how you feel.
This is a mistake.
You have no idea how I feel.
Sara could be anywhere.
I don't even know if she's alive.
"You offer a reward before the abductors issue demands, we're going to lose the advantage."
What advantage?
"She's out there, pregnant."
"You haven't found my ex-wife, and my daughter's MIA."
Your daughter's not missing.
She just didn't want to be here.
"You know, I can't eat, I can't sleep, and I sure as hell can't sit here and do nothing."
"We're going to break into the 11:00 news, we need to go now."
"All I care about is my wife, and the only way you're going to stop me is if you pull out that gun and shoot."
Senator!
"If you're gonna do this, do it right-- look straight into the camera."
"There's a good chance the perp's watching, and if he is, he's enjoying your pain."
Let him.
"We get lucky, maybe we can draw him out."
Thank you.
All right.
He fell off a building.
Don't you read the papers?
"Listen, Sheriff, I'm really sorry... to have awoken you from your slumber, but it's over."
Hands are tied now.
You shut me down.
Listen to me.
You're IA.
That's why I came to you.
You can do whatever you want.
"Remember you came to me, said, ""You wanna be a cop?"" I'm bein' a cop."
- I offered you a chance.
- I'm asking you for some help.
I need to do something.
I need to do this for myself.
"Listen, you deaf fuck."
I offered you a chance.
"When we could have done something, I offered you a chance to be a cop... and you blew it!"
You blew it.
You people are all the same.
"That cupcake makes a mess, we got a case again."
The mob runs millions in drugs through their precinct... and everybody gets a nice house.
Figgs is right.
The mob owns this town.
"They closed the case, Freddy."
- If they don't have the stomach for it—
- They had to.
It's circumstantial.
You don't have anything either.
All that stuff is illegal.
You stole it.
I know this guy.
He's a corrections officer.
I was sort of heard you on the phone.
I'm starting in the fall. uh i just transferred from b.u. scott.
I'm dan. nice to meet you scott.
- Maybe i'll£¬uh i'll see you around. - yeah.
We got this for you.
I'll take that. thank you.
What are you doing here?
What i should have done months ago.
In about five seconds your phones are all going to go off
With the latest gossip girl blast.
She is nothing if not punctual. allow me.
Remember all those secrets jenny amassed
When she was trying to protect you nelly?
Well now the world knows them too.
So looks like we have a winner.
Now if you don't mind...
How can you do this?
Letting some girl from brooklyn carry on our legacy?
Haven't you ever heard of a foreign queen?
Besides her dad is marrying lily bass£¬
So i think that makes her richer than all of you.
Not enough.
Okay so starting next year no more headbands
Except for this one.
- Thanks you can keep the change. - oh big spender.
Hey mom. it's really cool here.
Um i've already met some great people.
Yeah.
All right. all right. you were right about portland.
I think i'm gonna love it.
All right. yeah i--listen i gotta go all right?
- I'll--i'll call you soon. - well i'm done for the day.
We would now have one of our own as a member.
-Who's this?
-This is Vinnie.
What happened?
Did we get straightened out?
We had a problem.
We tried to do everything we could.
You know what I mean.
"He's gone, and we couldn't do nothing about it."
What do you mean?
He's gone.
He's gone.
And that's it.
I knew it!
I can't fuckin' believe it.
-They fucking whacked him.
-Fuck.
Are you all right?
"It was revenge for Billy Batts, and a lot of other things."
And that's that.
And there was nothing that we could do about it.
Batts was a made man and Tommy wasn't.
We had to sit still and take it.
It was among the Italians.
It was real greaseball shit.
They even shot Tommy in the face so his mother couldn't give him an open-coffin at the funeral.
I was gonna be busy all day.
I had to drop off some guns at Jimmy's to match some silencers he had gotten.
I had to pick up my brother at the hospital and pick up some stuff for Lois to fly down to some customers I had near Atlanta.
Right away I knew he didn't want them and I'd be stuck for the money.
I only bought the damn guns because he wanted them and now he didn't want them.
What the fuck good are these things?
"Apparently he's only been missing for a couple of hours, which means she couldn't have done it."
It looks like Zaddik might have been telling the truth
Colonel Sheppard.
Is there any progress with this hunt?
We're working on it.
Maybe we could help you.
That won't be necessary.
We're sick of doing nothing.
We're sick of being afraid all the time.
That thing is hunting in daylight now.
We'll never be safe.
Just be patient.
We'll take care of it.
You see?
I told you she wasn't responsible for the killings.
The serum makes it unnecessary for her to feed.
Can you confirm that?
Not yet.
It'll be a while before I can complete my analysis.
All right.
"Well, in the meantime,"
There's another wraith out there.
I believe Ellia may be able to help us find it.
How?
May I speak with her?
All right.
May I join you?
"Ellia, we need your help."
You can sense the other wraith.
It is all right.
It is nothing to be ashamed of.
"In fact, I have the same ability."
Everyone has his own reasons for avoiding the authorites in their home.
"They have a very good reason, they've heroin there."
I sure wouldn't like to be in their shoes right now.
I wouldn't like it either.
What are we gonna do?
"Just leave him there, we're going to Berlin baby, aren't we?"
Sure.
We should have a wake.
There's no food.
So I go to the store and get some food.
These are no protection for aliens.
Oh!
And do you have protection for aliens?
You have a laser down in your pants?
I think I need another drink.
"Wake up, honey..."
Come on get up and take a shower.
"I feel sick, Kathy."
I know you feel sick.
You took drugs today.
No...
Come on and stand up It'll make you feel better.
Guests are already starting to arrive.
Can't miss the party.
Fuck the guests.
"You are brave, noble knight."
Why don't you go overthere and freed those two beauties from the dragon?
It's exactly what I'm gonna do.
You're going...over to the appartment?
"No the little one just went out, I want to try to warn her."
Are you serious?
Yes.
I'll hold back the watchman.
I'd kiss my love for one last time.
Then follow you at once.
Do not be late.
Who's there?
Who's there?
Who's within?
"Just one kiss, in case some venom lingers on your lips."
Your mouth is warm.
I will explain.
The boy has come here at my bidding.
Somebody's coming.
Then I'll be brief.
"Oh, happy dagger."
This is thy sheath.
There rust... and let me die.
Patience now.
We should not disturb this holy quiet.
- Show me the way!
"- Very well, very well."
If you insist.
"We know now how this sorrow came about, and pardon all the players in their end."
Their own forbidden love did murder them.
Yet can we take a lesson from their deaths.
"Capulet, Montague."
"See what a scourge is laid upon your hate, that heaven finds means to kill your joy with love."
"Oh, dearest Montague."
Give me your hand.
"The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head."
And join with all in grieving for the dead.
"For never was a story of more woe than this, of Juliet and her Romeo."
I have to go.
Gas company?
My father.
He's in prison for fraud.
"When my grandmother died, she left us some money."
He says it's to pay back the people he's defrauded.
"It's all done under this pretence of ""I wanna get to know you better."""
Can't blame him for that.
What do you mean?
"Well, he must be very proud of you."
Must want to have a relationship with his daughter.
"Yeah, I just don't trust that that is what he wants."
"Sounds like he's tying to put things right, paying people back."
Maybe you need to stop being embarrassed by him and forgive him.
"You really say what you think, don't you?"
I haven't got the energy or the time to pretend any more.
MOBILE PHONE RINGS sorry.
"Oh, it's Leo."
Hello?
"Yeah, he's right here."
Why?
What's happened?
You're right.
"It's so much better, purer, just... to do it, without recourse to who or why."
When do we kill again?
I think that'll be your last one.
What?
You've made too many mistakes.
"But you said yourself, the less we care, the more likely we are to get away with it."
I'm not sure we have the same motivation.
But I do.
I have the same ideals.
Talk.
"Well, I was headed into work on 57th."
Today was my day to open up the shop.
So I took the 5:00 a.m. bus into town.
"Just got off and headed down State Street, and that's when I heard..."
It was awful.
It sounded like a dying animal.
"And I-I got to the corner, and that's when I saw him."
"And he-he was lying there on his side, and, um, there was all this blood and..."
But he was still alive.
What time was that?
It was just after 5:30.
"Okay, then what?"
"Well, he-he reached out his hand like he was asking for help."
"I tried to apply pressure to the wound, but it was too late;"
he was gone.
When did you call 911?
I called from my cell on the way to work about a quarter to 6:00.
You left him there?
"I felt bad, but I had to leave."
Man was dead?
Yeah.
My boss gets mad if I'm late.
"I need this job, Agent Gibbs."
Did you tell the 911 operator that Petty Officer Adams was dead?
"I gave them the location, my name, the address where I was at."
There any other witnesses there at the scene?
Just me; that's why I called as soon as I could.
I didn't want to leave him out there alone.
You ever watch someone die?
Not me.
Now I can't stop seeing his face.
"It takes grit, resolve."
"When I look at you, Lucy, I see how smart you are and how hard you work."
I see how much you want it.
But you don't have it.
"You don't even begin to have it, and you never, ever will."
[feet shuffling]
He sent me to tell you you're fired.
"Well, not fired."
"If anyone asks, we'll say you left of your own accord."
We wish you well.
Why do you hate me so much?
"I don't hate you, Lucy."
"After tonight, I won't even remember you were here."
[sobbing]
"Uh, there were two big booms."
"Um, that's the second one."
- You can see the fire.
- Mm-hmm.
All the burning plastic coming down.
"Uh, then came the wave."
The wave that sank your boat.
Yeah.
"Now, after the first time we spoke, what happened?"
"This guy came to us-- uh, Karl Stoltz-- and he said that there was a shipment--"
- Objection.
Hearsay.
- Sustained.
The jury will disregard.
"Why are you dressed like that, Gabriel?"
"Uh, after we first talked to you about the boat, this guy Stoltz showed up to set us up on a drug deal."
- Your Honor.
- He framed us.
What is the matter with you?
What the fuck kind of people are they?
We weren't married to nine-to-five guys.
But the first time I realized how different was when Mickey had a hostess party.
"-Karen, where you from?"
-Lawrence.
"Ah, yeah, Lawrence."
Out on the island.
That's nice.
I'm from Miami.
You ever been there?
"It's okay, but it's like you died and woke up in Jew heaven."
Angie stop picking at that thing.
I'd like to smack his face.
The red-haired guy?
He looks like a farmer...
I'm tellin' ya I can't get through the gate without this guys hands all over me.
"So I told him, ""Keep your fucking hands off me, or I'll cut them off."""
She means it.
He's lucky. I just mention this to Vinnie--
How can you mention it?
Vinnie'd kill him.
"Vinnie'll kill the miserable bastard, then he'll be there for life."
Talk about problems.
What about Jeannie's kid?
He was in an argument.
A lousy $10 card game.
He pulls out a gun.
The gun goes off.
Some kid gets killed.
When the grandmother hears finds out he's in jail she has a heart attack and drops dead right on the spot.
Now Jeannie has a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
"If I just tell them once,"
You shall not find a place even in the market.
Brother!
Very good!
"Brother, very good."
Good to see this part of you today.
"You have educated yourself to grow so big that,"
You raised your hand on your elder brother.
That too for the sake of this girl?
Be happy in your world.
Before I go I shall give you a word.
"You shall not come for my burial, after I die."
When you need your brother... you may even ask for my life.
Your brother will lay down his life for you.
I can't even ask you for forgiveness.
My brothers have left me worthless in my own view.
"Come, I shall drop you home."
"""Be it love or god, it goes away like this""."
"""It feels as though every prayer have become worthless""."
Sheen!
"""I gathered every bit to make a home""."
"""But somehow the winds go to know of it""."
"""Oh god, oh god""."
"""Oh god, oh god""."
"""Oh god, oh god""."
"""Oh god, oh god""."
"""Oh god, oh god""."
"""Oh god, oh god""."
"""Oh god, oh god""."
"""Love is off the target at times""."
"""On one side is Love and on the other is the world""."
"""Love is off the target at times""."
Drink it.
Fine.
"God, you're so bossy."
Force of habit.
I'm a nurse.
"Wait, you're that Annie?"
I'm calling my lawyer.
This is ridiculous.
I already told you everything.
"Well, You didn't tell us that your husband withdrew $10,000 three days before his death."
"Yeah, that's right, we have access to his financial records as well."
Maybe you do need to call your lawyer.
You didn't tell us about this either.
I did...
I didn't do anything.
You withheld information.
I can only think of one reason why you'd do that.
Because Troy had help ending his life.
You were there.
"Yeah, well, I wasn't there."
My husband needed me and I wasn't there.
"A few weeks before he died, he came apart."
He said he couldn't take it anymore.
He wanted it to end.
So he asked you to help him die.
"And instead of listening to what he wanted, I got angry."
And we had this huge fight.
I told him he was selfish.
Why didn't you tell us about it?
"Because I realized that he'd found someone to help him do what he wanted, someone to help him die."
And I was grateful.
I'm sorry.
Won't every day start fresh for you?
He's Devadas...no he's Kalidas...
This is fine for us...
We've memory loss...
Hey Babe!
My heart will never stop...
"Isn't this loss, a big profit for us, boss?"
"No battles or wars or without history, this life is a curse..."
"So my dear, buddy..."
This life is not a curse but a big boon...
Oh God!
I'm stuck!
Is memory loss a boon to you?
I feel...
Hey stay out!
I'll kill you...
"bloody, I'll kill you..."
Let's escape!
"Is she so angry on me, bloody bitch?"
Why did you beat him severely?
I should've killed him.
He's happy forgetting the past.
Enjoying life.
"While falling in love, he was happy, while in love, he was happy, even in separation, he's happy."
Is forgetting past a boon?
"Bloody, I'll kill him..."
Sister!
"You beat him, right?"
Leave him.
I'll not leave him simply.
What will you do?
"I'll make him remember our past, I'll make him remember our love, when he remembers everything, I'll marry Kalyankrishna then."
"- He already has, and he will gladly continue."
Get out of my house.
My house too.
No.
It was never your house.
You just lived here.
"You know, I'd like to hope that in a few months' time, we'll both have some perspective on this and be able to move somewhere, like forward."
This feels irreparable.
You accusing me of indifference?
You don't seem to be struggling.
I am.
Just not in the ways that you notice.
You need a haircut.
I know.
(DOOR CLOSES)
I'm pretty sure I'm missing a brush.
I'll bet one of those models yoinked it.
You got any plans tonight?
"Just gonna stay in, or are you going out?"
We were together for almost three years.
Do you want to come over?
We were just gonna make dinner at home.
You should come.
"No, thanks."
I don't want to be a burden.
You're not being a burden.
I couldn't tell him anything without him getting depressed and jealous.
Now he's gone.
He owes me a lot of money.
"You know, when he was writing and had no income."
Thousands of dollars.
I don't mean to bring you into it.
"Sweetheart, I'm a shark attack survivor."
I'm fried.
"Honey, I think the fear was a lot worse than the actual attack, which I can totally appreciate, but the good news is you weren't hurt, so let's not ruin the evening over it."
I'm sorry?
"Honey, you weren't hurt."
Good night.
Dave!
Where you going?
Dave.
"Come on, okay, you got bit by the shark."
"You got bit, I believe you!"
"We're here all the time, so let's take that opportunity to go to bed."
"Honey, we'll go to the waterfall with you."
We'll grab our drinks and go.
Yeah.
We could all go together.
It'll be beautiful.
Hon?
"I was thinking that maybe we might go back to the room, huh?"
"Bolt the door, draw the shades, huh?"
Just shut the whole world out and sit Indian-style and really explore our feelings.
Daddy!
Wake up!
It's too deep!
"Yo, you having a nightmare."
You ain't even in the water.
It's night time.
"Look, you said we was gonna have fun, so let's get up, let's dance, let's do a shot, let's do something."
Anything.
"Baby, let's just go back to the room, all right?"
I don't want to go back to the room.
I don't want to go to sleep.
"I'm only thinking of you, josie."
What about nick?
He's disloyal!
He goes down with the rest!
"Must everyone go down except you, jim?"
You don't realize what you're doing.
People are losing everything.
They're suffering.
They're being ruined.
They're killing themselves.
"You're hated, jim."
"But only by the little people, josie."
"Are we any different than little people, jim?"
I was one when i met you.
You made me big with your courage and your ideas and your money.
"But if this is what it means, i don't want it, jim."
It comes too high.
What do we care what the world is saying?
"Tomorrow, i'll buy it and give it to you!"
I don't want it!
"Right now, there are only two people in this world that count-you and me!"
I'm just beginning to feel the power that's in me.
I know now that nothing can stop me.
Whatever stands in my way must go down!
"Jim, i don't know you."
I'm almost afraid of you.
"No, you're not afraid of me."
"You're afraid of life, josie."
But i'm going to make you love it as much as i do as much as i love you.
"What's happened to you, jim?"
You used to be kind and generous.
You were the kindest man i ever knew.
"We take a dog, tie him to a bicycle..."
No!
It's just not good enough!
Mom's home early!
"You do not pinch, you do not poke, you do not bite, youdonotspit,youdonot eye-gouge, you do not vomit intentionally on other babies!"
A lifetime ban from Gymboree!
A lifetime ban!
I can't believe it.
She didn't even see the board.
This is a sign we were meant to have this.
"We were meant to do something really, really great with you."
It'll come.
We just have to be patient.
No!
This is Mommy's purse!
You can't have it!
"Please, it's the only thing in the house that's Mommy's!"
Lois...
"Well, he has a million toys."
Why does he only want to take my things?
"Honey, honey, you're taking this too personally."
He doesn't understand what he's doing.
He's just a baby.
"Look, if you just give it to him for just a couple of minutes, he'll get tired of it."
You're right.
"I guess I was just feeling that if I gave in to him, he'd see it as a sign of weakness."
- I'm going to stop this right now.
- Yeah.
"Here, sweetie."
Mommy's purse.
"You can have that for five minutes, okay?"
I thought you said he wasn't eating anything.
Only your gargoyles can save us now.
Are you out of your mind?
You almost killed us.
"I won't give up until I get the truth, Elisa."
The truth about you and the gargoyles.
I know you're out there!
"Oh, I know all about you."
Now show yourselves!
(door shuts)
I know.
I know.
This is where you shake your head and tell me I'm wasting my time.
They... they don't follow me everywhere I go.
Come on.
This time I'll drive.
This sounds like a stall.
What do you mean we have to wait?
We didn't get back in time.
You can't see them now.
Meet me back here ten minutes before sunset.
You won't be disappointed.
I promise.
"The rest of the day wasn't a total loss, not a by a long shot."
I have a meeting with the gargoyles tonight.
Your information was accurate.
So much for our good faith.
- Now we come to yours.
- Just tell me what I have to do.
Bring us a gargoyle.
"A few hours later, Elisa and I rendezvoused in the clock tower."
"She took me outside, but I still didn't know what to expect."
Statues?
"""you have cut me up to back too far."
"""You're worse than Mario Chalmers"
"""and Tiago Splitter if they were ever barbers."
"""You should have your barber's license revoked."
"You should never be able to cut anybody's hair."""
"Have fun with your life, man."
I have fun doing this for y'all.
You gotta have fun.
You don't know how long you're gonna be here.
You gotta keep yourself in shape.
You lift weights?
All the time.
"He's like, ""Yeah, I lift."
"Yeah."""
"Look, man, you gotta keep yourself in shape, 'cause you don't wanna get ""stitties."""
Stitties.
Stomach titties.
You ever seen that?
Be a big-ass piece of meat just falling down here.
"Big-ass piece of meat just falling all the way down here, look like you can play hacky-sack with it."
You just go just like this here.
"Hey, folks, I can talk about it, 'cause I used to be fat."
"I used to be big as hell, okay?"
"I was 5'8"", I was 250 pounds, and I was 17."
That's a fat fuck.
That's what it is.
"I lost 75 pounds in, like, four months."
"I'm not kidding about this, you know what I'm saying?"
It's real.
You can do it.
"But, you know, it was bad."
"You know, I was one of those little fat kids that didn't want nobody to see my breasts."
"-Rick,you don't have to... -jody,I'm your husband."
So why didn't you tell us you knew lance corporal finn?
I s afraid that my husband would find out.
That you killed him?
I didn't kill james.
It was an accident.
"Fell,he hit his head;"
I did not kill him.
I loved him.
Swear to god.
Do you have any idea how many murderers swear to god they didn't do it?
I come from a good catholic family.
"When we swear to god,we mean it."
Room for one more?
"I haven't seen you in observation for a while,ducky."
I've learned as much as I can from the dead.
It's time to listen to theiving.
You met in a bar.
Yes.How did yoknow that?
When?
Nine months ago.
You sleep with him that night?
No!
That's right--
I forgot you're from a good catholic family.
Did you sleep with him the second night?
Your husband never knew.
"I would tell him that I had a late showing, and I'd meet james at the house on larson lane."
"I know that that sounds immoral, but it is not what you think."
"Well,let me guess."
You had a deep spiritual connection.
Exactly.
"Okay, good."
I think we just solved a murder.
The sun is in our eyes and in our hearts even when it's night and when it's dark.
"The moon still glows, the stars still shine,"
Now and forever until the end of time.
What do you think?
I think you need to dig deeper.
What does that mean?
I can't tell you that.
"It's just, like, part of the journey."
"You look pretty, Mama."
"Thank you, baby."
"I'm gonna go get my notebook, okay?"
I wrote more poems.
That's great.
"So, keep an eye on Jess and Naomi, shut down any fist fights, and..."
"Yeah, I shouldn't be too late."
So are you still in business?
"As a doctor, I remain a member of society with a special obligation to all of my fellow human beings."
I don't think you have to be a doctor to have that obligation.
What do you mean?
I want in.
We could be partners.
I already have a partner.
"Well, then I'll be your receptionist."
It doesn't work like that.
"Mary, I need a career change, and we'd make a great team."
"Let's talk about this later, shall we?"
You need me.
I love you.
"Hey, where are you going, anyway?"
A funeral.
You know that.
"Does it really matter, Jamal?"
It don't matter if it matters.
It's corporate.
Take it to go.
Can I have my check?
Wipe that down before you leave.
Is this both weeks?
Jamal:
Same as always.
"You don't know me, but this is not me."
I don't suffer complicated women.
"But Laura, you know, she's got me..."
She's got me making exceptions.
So this chick lives in the same house she lived in with her ex?
Yes.
- And he owns the house.
- Correct.
- And they're not fucking?
- Nope.
"So he's giving her a dope house for free, taking her to all these high-end events, and she's not giving it up?"
"Yo, I got to find me a guy like this."
You think she's full of shit?
"Look, I don't know her."
"No, but I'm asking for your opinion 'cause my instincts are askew."
"No dude's ever given me anything for free, period."
"If she's fucking him, I don't know when she's doing it because I'm with her all the fucking time."
"Well, she's not with you now."
"What, you don't think people fuck during the daytime?"
[Blender whirring]
Of course.
"I mean, people fuck at all times."
I was just making sure you were alive.
"I'm sorry, sweetie, it was a late night."
My head is throbbing.
I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't bring the party home.
"And I'm pretty sure the neighbors would appreciate it, too."
"It wasn't a party, it was one guy."
Don't be so judgey.
I talked to Roberta at the Grill and... there's still a bartending position open.
If you wanted to get a job.
"Well, I figured she'd still be pissed about the last time I work there."
I think she's desperate.
I'll check it out.
- Don't act so surprised.
"- Well, I mean, I just..."
I didn't know how long you planned on sticking around.
"- Well, there's back grant due."
"- It's back in everything, mom."
"Like I said, I'll check it out."
- Who's that?
- That's Caroline.
Easy.
"Yeah, come in."
"Okay, we're gonna be late, so, let's just get going."
- How are you?
- Good.
Damon hasn't said a word to me.
"Every time I try to talk to him, he shuts me down."
Do you think he's still trying to find Katherine?
I don't know.
"He waited 145 years, only to find out that Katherine could not care less."
"That's gotta hurt, right?"
And it couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.
hey hate dancing  with a passion and it goes to a whole sort of different level.
Can we just put that in?
Some point in the--
That's the dinosaur.
It's a bird pecking the sea.
"No, the bird, you dance out here, and the dinosaur's this."
I Iove how we basically take the piss out of dance moves.
And the winner:
Zayn MaIik.
"Okay, from the top."
When you go on tour the outfit you've got's the outfit you're stuck with so I'm gonna be wearing these clothes for a good eight months now.
Is this working?
Can you get in?
I feel weird wearing a trench coat.
It's the Harry styles look.
It looks good.
You look like one of those adverts.
You do though.
"here's been times when they've dressed us all in the same clothes and we're like, "" No, we can't do that."""
This is the:
""" I'm gonna rob your nan"" look."
"This T is bad, though."
I Iike this T-shirt.
-Is it not happening?
-They're a bit tight.
I just wanna see for the look.
"Oh, my God."
e have to be our own people.
I don't think this band would've worked if we wasn't because as soon as someone tries to tell us  what to do....
"Now do a normal one, please, honey."
It's like having five rowdy boys in a class at school.
Honey please.
If someone hadn't helped me...
I wouldn't be here.
Hello?
How are you?
I'm good.
"Listen, I hate to ask, but"
I need your help with something.
"Uh, of course."
China has alopecia.
We need to call the vet.
"Um, are you free for lunch?"
Yeah.
"I have some stuff that I need to do for work, but that sounds great."
"So you guys, I've been thinking about a plan."
"You know, right now this could very well be the first stop on our pancake tour of North America."
"Hey, like in On The Road."
That's my favorite book.
"Mine, too."
So here's the deal.
My mom had this boyfriend.
He hired me to work construction last summer.
But then they broke up...he moved away...to Austin.
In Texas?
"Said if I was ever out there look him up, so..."
"I mean, well, that's really kind of far."
We were thinking like Long Beach or something so we can all still hang out.
I'll need to get a couple of days of work so I can get a little bit of travel money.
"Well, I mean, we can get you money."
"Well, I mean, I guess in a way you're kind of lucky."
"You get to move to a whole new place, start over, be whoever you want to be."
That's really not so bad.
"Hey, putz."
That's a lot.
I sort of flew off the handle when you said what you did.
I'm sorry.
I don't blame you.
Nick.
Jim's going to ask me to marry him tonight.
What can i say to him?
You know what to say.
"Well, i can't marry him."
L- i don't love him.
You know that.
"I can't help you, josie."
You've known this was coming for a long time.
You've taken everything he's offered you.
Now you've got to pay for it.
But not with love.
"Jim loves you, josie... and i don't."
"If you don't go through with it, everything i ever said about you is true."
"You know, i never asked you... if you'd let me give you a ring for that finger."
Will you put it on?
Nick.
"I had to see you, josie."
"Josie, you did the right thing tonight."
I've been walking the streets for hours telling myself that.
And i want you to know i lied to you.
About you and me?
I knew it.
"Once, i thought that a star on a dressing room door would be worth any sacrifice."
"But the one sacrifice i never figured on... i'm going to make that, nick."
"I'm glad you feel that way about it, josie."
She is so beautiful so lovely all is vanity and vanity will make you blind
do you hear that?
(BRANCHES BREAKING)
Stop there.
Throw down your weapons.
We're screwed.
Maquis.
And who are they?
These are some assholes.
"Say that again, if you've got the balls."
You are assholes.
Fine.
You asked for it.
(Shoots a blank)
"You're the asshole, who cheats at cards."
"You couldn't beat me at cards if you wore a hood, Mariano."
You know each other?
"Yeah, they also work for the Ministry."
"So, you mean that all this is a joke."
"Yeah, we do it to all the new guys, like you."
Interesting sense of humor you have.
If we don't have a little fun now and then this will be the death of us.
"Come on, let's go."
Not a damn bit funny.
We're almost there.
Are you sure that the translator won't show up in Hendaye?
I took care of him.
"He'll spend a few weeks glued to the toilet,"
I assure you.
Why do I never get to seduce a beautiful woman instead of greasy lechers?
For the same reason we're going to see Hitler and not Ava Gardner.
"Look, her I did meet, but I must be the only one who doesn't brag about it."
Hitler.
There have been too many assholes in this world and I've met a lot of them.
"Actually, I was gonna buy a new pair."
But I can barely see without these.
- Come on.
"- Well, these were expensive."
Let's start the bidding.
So you didn't think this was a date?
"No, not really."
Why?
Is it a date?
I thought it was a date.
"No, it's not a date."
- What about the regards?
- Regards don't mean anything.
"I mean, it's not like I said hi."
"I mean, the fact is I shouldn't say anything."
"- No, tell me."
- Can you keep a secret?
- Me?
"Oh, yeah."
I never had feelings for Gary until he got sick.
But he was so brave and gained such a wonderful perspective on life.
I fell in love with him.
"Yeah, he's got some perspective there."
"- Hey, you know what the whip does?"
- What whip?
The whip in the Senate and the House.
"Well, in the old days when the senators didn't vote the way that the party leaders wanted them to, they whipped them."
"""You better vote the way we want you to, or there's gonna be big trouble."""
"She won't talk to anyone, huh?"
"Oh, no, she won't say a word to anybody."
"Well, she's talking a blue streak now, Jack."
"Well, well, the white whale."
"And you can get completely out of the habit of it, you see?"
"And before you know it, your neck muscles are straining and your eyes are doing all these crazy things."
So you just went out and picked up the first guy you saw?
He wasn't the first.
Th-The first three said no.
"Wow, it's like a romance novel."
He said I was foxy.
"When I say it out loud, it doesn't really seem like a good enough reason to sleep with somebody, but... it was 10:00 at night, on a sidewalk, in front of a grocery store, you know?"
I was all good to go.
"Please don't tell me any more, mother of my child."
"And then I tried to break up with him today, but he made me a mix tape."
Supertramp?
They are so good.
"I know it sounds a little pitiful, but, I mean, it was my first time out there, and I just..."
I-I wasn't sure if anybody was gonna want me.
Are you kidding?
"Christine, you're incredibly sexy."
"In fact, sometimes I still scream out your name during sex."
"Oh, you do?"
"Oh, shut up!"
She has my same name!
That's true.
But I still think you're sexy.
"Well, yeah, whatever."
Anyway...
"I got one under my belt, okay?"
I feel good.
Now I can move on.
- You gonna get that?
- No.
"Oh, this is ridiculous."
I got to do this.
Did you bring me here to stare at the lake?
"No, I brought you out here to understand why you're so angry with me."
"You know, you're at the age I was when my mother was really sick, right before she died."
Before she killed herself?
Yeah.
It happened right there.
I was 16.
I was so angry.
"I remember feeling like everything was always about her, you know, she was so consumed with her own life, her own misery, and Jess, I don't want you to ever have to feel that way."
I want you to know that you can come to me about anything whenever you want.
"Jess, I can tell you're in pain."
What's going on?
It's Naomi.
What do you mean?
We just have a complicated relationship.
I love her.
"Like, I mean, like, I'm in love with her."
"Or I thought I was, I don't know."
I thought she...
"She loved me too, but sh..."
"Oh, honey."
I'm sure she does love you in her own way.
"And if she doesn't, it's her loss."
"I mean, who could not love you?"
You're perfect.
I am?
"Jess, you're perfect in every way."
Why did you lie for her?
What do you mean?
"Naomi took the drugs, you know, the drugs you had in your shed for Casper?"
"She told me, she told me that you lied for her."
Why would you do that?
She got pregnant in '96'.
Who was she?
Where did she work?
She must have talked to someone.
I brought the plants in.
"If the room is too hot, they'll think it's spring."
- I'll call if we find anything.
"- Yes, OK."
"Let's hope for a period without frost, or we can't plant them until spring."
I've made some pumpkin soup.
You didn't see it.
Close it again.
The ultrasound images.
I'll heat the soup.
"No, I'm not up for soup, candles, and ultrasound images right now."
There's no need for you to get upset.
I'm only staying till tomorrow.
Did you speak to Mark?
Yes.
All he said was that he didn't know what to do.
I need to think about myself now...
and the baby.
"I'll move in with a friend, or move back to my parents."
That's likely to change when the baby comes.
- You have the ﬂat.
"- No, that won't be ready."
Someone stopped by to inspect the ceilings.
"They say there's asbestos, and that it'll all have to be torn down."
"Well, if you could handle being a single mum, I suppose I can as well."
I don't think I handled it particularly well.
I thought I could give Mark a...
"Well, I couldn't."
I panicked.
I was nervous.
It was my first day and I just...
I want people in this office to respect me and they're not if they think...
"One day, you're gonna have to come clean."
Not if I meet somebody really soon.
I called the matchmaker.
"The pushy, judgmental, objectifying matchmaker?"
"- Yeah, that would be the one."
"- Oh, the irony of this moment."
Could I just have a minute to enjoy this?
"Oh, knock yourself out."
"Well, I can't enjoy it if you're gonna enjoy it."
"Kitty, you don't have to prove yourself to the staff."
"I mean, ignore them, or I can talk to them."
No!
"No, no, no."
No!
"No, no, no!"
Don't.
It's fine.
I don't think that the office scuttlebutt was the only reason.
- It is hard to meet people.
- Tell me about it.
I met my wife at a kegger.
I filled her plastic cup up with flat beer and that was that.
Today I don't have the first idea where to meet women.
"If it makes you feel better, I was half-tempted to call her myself."
Really?
"Well, yeah."
"Yeah, that does make me feel better."
It's just that...
Maybe you're right.
Ice cream and bowling.
Let's go!
Miley.
"I'm sorry, maybe you can deal with this but..."
Please don't say it.
...I can't.
So you're just gonna walk away from us?
"As long as there's two of you I don't think there can be an ""us""."
[Sighs]
You know dad I really thought that Jesse was different.
I thought he could handle all this.
Ah you just gotta give the boy some time Mile.
"If he really loves you, he'll be back."
"If he really loves that pretty boy face of his, he won't be."
Daddy.
Oh I'm sorry honey.
I just hate seeing you this hurt.
Truth is whether you're ready to hear it or not if he comes back that's great.
"And if he doesn't, there'll be other boys."
I keep praying there won't be but there always are.
I don't know.
Maybe I should just give up guys for good.
Oh now you're just teasing me.
Honey the truth is life has a funny way of working things out.
"One door closes, another one opens."
All you've got to be ready to tell yourself is...
[Screaming excitedly]
When your daughter asks if her best friend can live with you.
Think about it for more than a second.
[Continues screaming]
And then say no.
They'll arrest you if you don't.
Arrest me?
"Why, he's the thief."
Don't say things like that.
These people are police.
You'll make them angry.
"You keep out of this, Wooster."
"Come, Miss Lowman."
I happen to know that you arranged to meet McDermott here... and turn over the rest of the plans to him.
- Now you're being ridiculous.
- And I also know... that McDermott arranged to turn over his plans to the Faulkner Aircraft company.
"Oh, really?"
That's quite near here.
Just go down the road.
- Thank you very much for the information.
"- Oh, no charge, old boy."
"- So, you see, your pretense won't work, Miss Lowman."
- You might as well confess.
- Are you going to give them up or must we take them?
- I've said all I'm going to.
Very well then.
Go on.
Search her.
I can't allow you to manhandle the lady.
"- Sit down, jack-in-the-box."
"- I've had just about enough of you, Mr. Wooster."
This isn't cricket.
"If you want to search, have a matron here."
Search me.
"Wooster, if you interfere again, it'll be for last time."
"Here, take this."
"Very touchy on this ""blowpipe"" question."
- It's good to get out.
It was hot.
- I didn't notice it but I suppose I would if I'd been drinking as many beers as you have.
Thanks for reminding me.
Let's get some.
- Why don't you have an ice cream soda?
"- Oh, no."
Do you have to wake up with a hangover?
- Come on.
Let's go into Nick's.
- All right.
"Well, kids, how do you like the moving picture tonight?"
- It was grand.
"- Kind of sappy, if you ask me."
Sure.
Too much love stuff.
Is not for me.
"I like the racketeer pictures, boy."
"You know, shoot them up."
Is more excitement as love.
"Why, Nick, where's the romance in your soul?"
"Where is the what, please?"
Romance.
"You know, two people falling in love and sitting in the moonlight gazing into each other's eyes."
"Well, I like this too but I like better to do it myself, personal than to see some guy in the movies do it."
"Huh, kid?"
I don't care what they say.
I think that love story was beautiful tonight.
It's a lot of bunk.
No real man would ever propose like that.
"- Oh, they don't."
- You don't have to look at a girl and tell her eyes are like the twinkling stars.
And here are the complete assets as of...
"Harold, I can't even balance a checkbook."
You'll have to explain it to me.
It's very simple.
"If we don't make some money in the next few months, we're out of business."
How much do you need?
"We need $50,000, partner."
"Oh, we've gone back to a partnership, have we?"
We never dissolved.
Everything's split right down the middle.
Up to now it's been 50%% of nothing.
When do the profits start coming in?
"""We could make a lot of money, Mrs. Brown. "" Remember?"
I remember you thought it was a pretty good idea at the time.
I was wrong.
I guess you should've stayed with John.
"Darling, I didn't mean that."
It wasn't just the money.
"You know that, don't you?"
I know.
Isn't there anything we can do?
"We've got to find some way to raise $50,000."
"Oh, the stuff will sell."
It just takes time.
Have you tried to get a loan?
All over town.
"They'd lend it to John, but they think I'm just a young upstart."
Maybe if John used his influence.
Would that help?
I don't think he'd do it.
"He'd do anything for the company, you know that."
It's worth trying.
"No, no."
No it doesn't.
No.
How can you read it?
It's just moving all over the place.
Let me see that Lilly.
I'm sorry.
But I mean how much more bad news can you take?
I mean you just found out you don't get to go to college.
With your best friend the day after you get rejected.
By the best boyfriend you ever had.
And now you've got an eye twitch.
But my grades are awesome.
I killed it on the SAT.
This is so not fair!
I know.
I mean I guess that stuff just wasn't important to Jesse.
And Stanford accepted you?
Lilly stand extremely still and don't let her sense your fear.
There has got to be some kind of mistake!
Lilly and I have just about the same grades.
And she only did a little bit better on the SAT.
And that's because my energy drink made me have to tinkle twice.
And Lilly can hold it like a camel!
I must say the fact that you just drove 200 miles.
To plead your case is very impressive.
That's the kind of character we look for here at Stanford.
We're going to be very sad not having you here.
Cookie?
This isn't fair.
I am being discriminated against.
Because I have a small bladder.
You're thankful.
"If house would have pointed at you instead of me, you'd be the one in here."
"Look straight forward, tell me when you can see... it's your job to go back!"
You're a doctor!
You go where the disease is!
Say when you can see the light.
"I'm dying, and you're sitting here measuring how fast I go?"
Tell me when you can see the light!
My vision's fine!
Your left-side periphery is reduced.
"It's fine, I'll prove it."
Ow!
Son of a bitch!
Now we're both exposed.
You got two choices.
"You can go tell house what just happened and get your own cot board in here, or you can go back to that apartment... you save me, the cop, and yourself."
It's not sspe.
I checked your past vaccinations against joe'S.
No batch matches.
Blood show antibodies for coxsackievirus?
"Guys, could you please shut him up?"
He's over his limit on morphine.
Where's cameron?
She said she has some stuff to do.
Said she'd be back soon.
What are you doing?
Foreman!
Stop!
I can't take it!
Imagine being constantly reminded of the... pain you're about to be in.
I can't take it!
Stop it!
Star power!
Yes!
"Sctanley, no!"
Yeah!
You hustled me.
"Yes, I did."
"For that, I'm sorry."
"You see, I sell video games, Sctanley."
"And this one here, in particular, in fact."
And I'm proud to stand here before you and tell you it brings me as much happiness as it does for the people I provide them to.
"And we had a bet, and I know that you're a man of your word."
Forget that you saw me and my friends and point me in the direction that I seek.
I cannot confirm or deny that the one that you seek is on the singles' side.
But a bet is a bet.
And I will tell you how to get there.
The beach is blocked by rocks.
It's completely impassable.
No more boats for me and my friends.
I go by foot.
I would be remiss if I did not advise you to wait until daylight.
Do not take this journey lightly.
Hmm.
"There is an old game path through the forest, just beyond the abandoned Starbucks."
Take it to where it forks.
Jog to the right.
Do not go to the left.
You will see lights.
You don't want to go there.
Keep walking.
Look up and locate the belt of Orion the Hunter.
I think we should be writing this down.
I think Dave's got it.
I don't know.
Perhaps a little.
"Dear, why don't you go up and change so we can have dinner?"
"Oh, that's a good idea."
I'll wash and then we'll eat.
"Oh, hey."
"Will you stay for dinner, Sam?"
"Well, I was."
"Thank you, John."
That'd be nice.
Didn't you tell him I was coming to dinner?
"Doctor, it was his idea to invite you tonight."
I reminded him just this morning.
I can hardly believe it.
"Why, his memory is phenomenal."
How long has he been like this?
It's been months.
"I kept trying to get him to see you, but he wouldn't."
"I begged him to take it easy, retire, but he just goes into a rage."
"What's wrong with him, Doctor?"
"Well, it certainly can't be anything physical."
I gave him a thorough checkup only a few weeks ago.
Would you object to having a specialist examine him?
A specialist?
What do you mean?
I mean a psychiatrist.
You don't think he's...
"Now, now, now, don't jump to conclusions."
It may be nothing more than just mental fatigue.
But I do think you should take him to see Dr. Croatman as soon as possible.
"Now, there, there, there."
Good morning.
I can only take so much of this!
Are you going to drink your life away?
Go home if you're not going to drink with me.
Don't you think you're overdoing it?
"I know you're hurt, but this is too much."
It's just a darn exam.
You never wore a scholar's robe before anyway.
Stay out of my life.
How could I?
Who are you to tell how to live my life?
Who am I?
How could you say such a heartless thing?
I'm your friend salt merchant Yim Chun-su.
"A friend, yes, we're friends..."
Come to think of it.
We make a fine pair.
You're a peasant's son and I am a traitors son.
We make a fine pair.
Are you done?
Is that why you're my friend?
Because you're poor and your grandfather was a traitor?
Are you saying you wouldn't have been my friend if you came from a rich and powerful clan?
Fine then.
Do what you want.
You can drink yourself to death for all I care!
Would you pour me a glass of that?
Is it hard to bear?
I'm glad.
I'm glad this happened to me and not to Yo-shin.
Ten years...
For ten years this river has been the source of comfort.
And in that time I had put it all behind.
Time is money!
You can't just wrap a gas hose around your neck every morning!
You need this fine little device.
"And if war reparations have left you with anything, it's that head on your shoulders that tells you that you need this!"
"Come out of the street, young man."
"If you get run over, who'll clean up the mess?"
"Buy my wares, ladies and gentlemen."
The price is right:
"One for 20, three for 50."
"It won't snap, split or break."
"Don't laugh, folks."
I just wanted to show you how sturdy and solid it is.
"Just 20 for one, 50 for three."
Here's your chance at a real deal!
"One for 20, three for 50."
Cilly!
So nice of you to come by!
I'll get my things and be right back.
I'll wait here.
"You know, Franz, you'd make a good family man:"
"Nightgown, felt slippers, the whole thing."
Something wrong with that?
You'll never get anywhere like that!
Wait and see.
Lots of guys are worse off.
They end up on the dole or get locked up out at Tegel.
What's gotten into you?
You're cozy here.
You can do anything you want.
Listen.
I have something for you.
What is it?
Bye.
"Tired, right?"
This is no joke.
Mom wasted two hours.
Why was there no shoot afterwards today?
It's a really busy studio.
There's no reason for me to be dragged around anymore.
You said you didn't want an outdoor shoot.
Dunk your legs in some warm water and rest up.
You should go to a sauna too.
Can't you just take some work off?
There's not much time left.
I'll do what I can.
"Jo Eun Young, please come in."
"Lee Seo Yeon, please come in."
Yes.
"Hello, doctor."
"Yes, take a seat."
I'll put it back when I leave.
"Oh, right."
They're going to use it as a villa and a work space.
"They've been investing money into the land but it hasn't raised in value for years, so his painter wife begged for a villa."
He's a painter?
The wife is.
"It's the wife's wish to live in the country and paint, and the husband also wants to put the main focus on her workshop."
"They're going to be living half the year in Seoul, half in the country."
The wife isn't your typical woman.
She even brought a wish list.
Thank you.
"All right, first, she wants a big workshop and a deck that leads out of it."
The deck needs to be spacious.
"The kitchen also needs to be big, and the living room should extend to the roof."
- Classic?
"Yeah, I have the money to spend on the really nice stuff, so I don't need to wear things that you bought at a garage sale for a dollar."
So you're still mad at me?
I don't need you to tell me that I should hire a nanny because I'm incompetent with your child.
- I never said that.
- You implied it.
It was your tone.
It was judgmental and... superior.
"If I said something that you took too personally,"
- I am sorry.
- That's the tone I'm talking about.
You know what?
"Can we please, please, please just go to the concert?"
We can argue in the car.
It's what Dave and I do.
you know this is... a work for me tonight.
Thank you.
"Since we're winding down with the game... oh, I didn't get you... the bow and everything."
"""Tin men"" and ""Avalon."""
"It's the rest of the ""Diner"" trilogy."
"Yeah, I know exactly what it is."
And this madness between us is a curse...
I don't wanna fight.
- I don't wanna fight either.
- Maybe you're right.
Maybe I am sensitive because...
I don't know much about babies.
"Every time I hold one, they start crying."
"I mean, it's like they...can sense my fear."
It's not gonna be that way with your own baby.
I swear.
You'll be amazed.
You haven't shed it yet.
Now who's on their back?
What the hell is going on?
Get your scurvy asses back down below.
You have to go now.
Go.
Go.
Keep your gun on them all.
Where'd he go?
He fell overboard.
He'll do well to survive with that wound he has.
Then good riddance.
"Well, at least they're stuck here a while longer while they fix our ship."
I don't think Atkins and his men will travel too far into the jungle anymore.
"Today, the battle may have been lost."
But the war is far from over.
"Have faith, my friend."
We will get you home.
Come.
Ripped By mstoll
You just fell for the oldest trick in the book!
And what book is that?
How to defeat the boastful warrior in one easy move.
"Well, then, you had better press home the advantage before it is too late."
But you're weaponless and flat on your back.
Really?
That makes it 3 hits to me.
"And to you... uh, none."
Who's that?
"Jacob, it's hotter than hell in here, and full of stinging things."
"You're my brother, nolan."
I think I will have to strangle them first.
That takes too much energy.
Just push them off from somewhere high.
What about you?
I hate autographs of people who have nothing but money.
"He says he's busy, and he won't even give me time to interview him."
All the data I have is 200 pages of blabber full of spelling mistakes.
He makes it so obvious that he's ignorant.
And I'm just a con girl making 800 pages from it.
It's so annoying.
And depressing.
You should write your stuff now.
I don't think I ever will.
I messed it all up from re-writing.
I can't even write 3 lines in an hour.
I can only write cheap lines.
I can't do it.
Don't do anything for 3 years.
It will come back.
Sounds great!
What am I going to eat?
Tap water and air?
I'll feed you.
I don't have talent anyways.
I'm just going to make a living.
How can you win twice without talent?
There are plenty of writers who win that contest and have nothing to write.
"Anyways, I'm a writer too."
That's how I get paid more for re-writing.
It's ridiculous.
"Oh yeah, I got a new client yesterday, so I paid aunt back."
Ain't I great?
"Here's the thing, you need to protect your family."
OK ?
"Policies start at $250,000."
We offer term or whole life.
You really can't go wrong.
"Think about it, Sally."
"People don't plan to fail, but they do fail to plan."
It's great to see you.
"Sir, may I talk with you for a minute ?"
"Yeah, officer."
What can I do you for ?
You lost your name tag.
I didn't go to this school.
So you go to reunions for the sheer fun of it ?
What is that ?
What is that ?
"Oh, it's a mortality clock."
It shows you how many seconds you have left on this Earth.
"You factor in age, habits, height and weight, and statistics tell the rest."
But the class of '90's going to start dropping around 2055.
So you sell life insurance at the reunion ?
It's a perfect place.
People are all focused on their fading youth.
"I know, it's sleazy, but it's working."
I go to class reunions all over the state.
Our detective said he saw you talking to the victim's wife.
I was consoling her.
How are you holding up ?
Patrick was taken much too soon.
"Jennie, yeah, I wanted to see how she was doing."
I met her when I sold her a policy.
- She bought a policy ?
When I see him...
He will still think of me when he sees me again.
"Well, first take the money that we owe him..."
I don't want his money!
"I want...never, I want nothing more from him..."
And his child I don't want at all!
Why should it live?
He himself never wanted it but... he shall see it!
First he shall see it and know how it feels when all is taken from one.
"Then I will kill it and myself, too."
But first I'll go to this shit of a dad and throw the dead kid at his feet!
Let him see how his conscience is dead.
"He'll cry and curse, that dog..."
I don't know where to go anymore.
My employer has fired me.
I have no place to sleep...
"I have no money, no papers."
Nothing.
Nothing at all...
"Well, have the child first, and the rest will follow."
"Going by the laundry, small wonder that he's run off..."
- Did you eavesdrop again?
- My hearing is excellent.
Bring the suitcase to Mrs Kunze.
She has a room free.
She can stay there.
"- Well, when are you due?"
- That's none of your damn business!
For how long should I rent the room then?
- For as long as she works for me.
- Under the table?
With no money and no papers?
All I wanted was to get the best film possible out of this.
We might not like how Kyle operates but the audience loves controversy.
"And if you don't have an audience, you're nothing."
"So the more immoral he is, the more you like him?"
Welcome to showbiz.
"Looks like you found your soul mate, after all."
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
If you're that desperate to save something go sponsor a panda.
Steve!
We're leaving.
Film makers observe they don't interfere.
That's just how it is.
That's pathetic.
You turn a blind eye to something you know isn't right.
"Hey, he's the bad guy, here, not me."
There's nothing I can do to stop him.
Maybe you're scared if you do stop him you won't get a film out of it.
Doesn't it occur to you that he might be using you the way he used us?
So?
I'm using him back.
We're even.
But it isn't right!
"OK, how about this?"
Don't audiences love an unexpected twist?
Are you sure this is an actual road?
Yeah.
"Not too many people know about it, but it's a good shortcut."
As long as you avoid the bog.
So...
Good.
What can you tell me about the prison?
I know about the prison.
We need all the information we can get.
I have to reach my crew.
Don't you think there are people in there
I'd like to get out?
Any sane person would tell youit's impossible.
Spoken like a coward.
"I've heard about you, old man."
You're the coward!
Enough.
What are you doing with this lunatic?
Has he been telling you stories of his brave deeds?
They're just fantasies.
Taking him along on this rescue mission of yours is suicide.
He's already saved me from the Mokra once.
And he saved you from those soldiers today.
"All right, stay with him."
"Go off to the prison, get yourself killed."
I don't have to get killed if you'll tell me what you know.
There are access tunnels on the north side.
"They'll get you in a little closer, but they're guarded."
Then I'll need weapons.
They're not free.
I don't have anything to trade.
Thas worth some weapons.
I can't.
"Yes, you can... if ill help to bring her back to us."
Thank you.
I can have someone meet you on the street in three hours to make the trade.
He'll be wearing a blue vest.
except to say that we probably don't want to be here when they arrived.
They ?
Who's they ?
Is this an interview or a hit ?
"Whatever , man."
Do you got any more cookies ?
Maybe.
Maybe not.
How about this.
"If you shoot me, I'll tell you where they are, and I'll throw in the recipe."
How're you going to do that dead ?
Start shooting and find out !
Hadi...haha.
"Excuse me, I need to confer with my colleague ."
Again?
Yea.
Again.
"Don't worry, I won't move this time."
I'll be right here when you get back.
"I know we have to off this guy coz that's what we got to do, but I don't want to do it until I know why he wants us to do it."
"I mean, something's wrong here."
"What's this, Daze ?"
I mean a guy doesn't just get up and highjack a truck chucked full of cash and cologne to get himself rub out.
There're other ways.
I want this guy's story but getting it will just make our job harder.
I mean it changes everything.
that's why they don't name any other pigs on a sausage farm.
And for that reason I think we shouldn't talk to him anymore.
That's going to be tough.
He's interesting.
He sure is.
How about those cookies?
And a bit risky.
"Well, the only way to get what you want is to risk what you have."
That's a belief you and I share.
And what is it that you want?
I'll find Audrey another date.
"You want Grace involved in this, fine."
But I can't have her working against us.
Why were you even there?
"I wanted to meet the person who was planning on screwing my husband, and I'm glad I did because that woman wanted to have your baby."
They're all looking for a connection.
That's why they're seeing an escort.
You of all people should know that.
Don't make this about me and Simon.
You know I have to have a date.
Then I want to be there.
"And I want a date, too."
I tell you what.
"If it'll make you more comfortable, you choose my date, and I'll choose someone for you."
This is insane.
Maybe.
Probably.
We don't have to do this.
"You just say the word, I'll call the whole thing off."
"No, I-I don't know where we're going, but..."
We can't go back to what we were.
So... tell me... what are you looking for in a escort?
- Thanks for coming.
- This better be important.
I've left you three messages over the last couple of days.
Your date for the party.
She's fun.
She's friendly.
"You're next, your song."
"Oh, my song."
We'll continue this later.
* Your eyes are simpatico
* Tonight they have told me
* That you'll be simpatico
* To me alone
* Your arms are simpatico
* And when they enfold me
* They hold me within a spell
* No lover has known
* When you do the things you do to me
* Every thrill I knew is new to me
* Go on and do the things you do to me
* When you do what you do
* You're so sympathetic
* Which means you're simpatico
* Which means I'm in heaven
* And heaven will be our home
* When you are mine
* When you do the things you do to me
* Every thrill I knew is new to me
* Go on and do the things you do to me
* When you do what you do
* You're so sympathetic
* Which means you're simpatico
* Which means I'm in heaven
* And heaven will be our home
* When you are mine
* Promise that you'll stay simpatico
"* Come what may, you'll stay simpatico"
* The way that I will stay simpatico
Or i will kill you.
Then you will left crying.
"Go back, stay away... go back..."
"Ma'am i am the same Laxmi Narayan, Ma'am I am not Laxmi Narayan!"
"Ma'am I was telling you, i am not that Laxmi Narayan!"
Inside... i will shout you if say a single word.
"Stop, hold him... teasing girl, even with those guns?"
"And including me also... i was just telling you, that he is the same Laxmi N. Who come to shout you."
"Then why didn't you said, ""that's him"" ""that's him""?"
You told me to shut my mouth.
I think he is scoundrel... i should let you hit by her sandles.
Just like the other day.
"Madam, i am fresh now."
Now show... i have never show it to anyone before.
What?
Never show?
Then how you do business?
Please don't call it Dhanda (business) I sounds very Ganda (bad)
Why is it bad?
"In our business, customer don't pay till they though the item."
And we have to show on words too.
You also show it?
Yeah... and you know my nature and ladies check every thing.
"Weather if its not loose, size is fine... we have to show every thing."
I am doing bussing like that for 40 years.
Show that... this is only for the watching purpose?
But who hit me?
"Don't know, there were two people."
"They hit you, and they were taking you with them."
"Then i stopped them and told them, that's my Laxmi Narayan."
Did you said that?
"Then they talked on the phone, and ran away."
It isn't sex you're afraid of.
"It's love, that's what you can't handle."
"That's what you offer me, with your hands on me?"
"That's one expression, backed up by many things."
I haven't asked for any of them.
Understand what you're saying no to.
"When I take you in my arms, I commit to you, not just physically but all the way."
"That means I intend to worry about you, to take care of you and that's what I want back from you, without any reservations or shame."
- Either you're up to that or not.
- I have my standards and pride.
They're not enough for anyone.
"You need someone to trust, to love."
"No, I don't."
I don't!
"Now, just leave me alone."
I can but I don't want to.
Let me help you.
I don't care if you hang back.
I'll give it time.
I can't.
The offer is always open.
I don't know if you'll take it up but perhaps it'll make you feel better to know it's there.
Hello.
"Yes, Marion."
I don't believe it.
Are you positive?
No.
"No, I'll call Mrs. Page myself."
"Operator, will you please connect me with Evelyn Page?"
I don't believe Norman did what you said.
Two people saw them.
- Marion has spread it all over town.
Should I die on the spot?
Is that what you want?
Stop acting like it doesn't hurt at least this moment!
-You have never broken down in front of me.
-How much more do I have to break down?
"You had someone you had to marry, I said I don't care."
"""Let me borrow you for a while until you get married. """
I'm always on stand-by except when I sleep.
I can't not think about you even for a sec.
"Right here, half of it."
"No, all of it is like being held by you."
That's only talk.
You always stood two steps away.
Can love have no obsession?
Can love have no desire to possess?
You didn't have such a thing.
Answer me.
"No, I don't."
What were you doing with me?
Were you playing with me?
Why are you doing this?
What do you want to know?
You're being way too cool.
You're ok.
She's miserable.
What happened to her?
She has an inoperable tumor at the base of her brain.
"It's probably been there, according to the doctor, since she was born."
"I guess as she got older, it grew."
We didn't even know it was there until three years ago.
"She's a tough cookie, you know."
"She always to shake it off, take aspirin, say it really didn't her hurt that bad."
You're the whole reason that I'm here.
You're the whole reason that I've done all of this.
You're the whole reason that I've made a complete ass out of myself.
I have failed here miserably.
And that does not bother me.
What bothers me is that I have failed you and I am not gonna do that ever again.
All right?
I love you a lot.
Let's go get a drink.
Oh.
"Honey, it has been forever since we did something like this."
Yeah.
"You know, baby, it's funny."
"Since we've been here, it's like the therapist and the place has made it like we got a problem."
But you know what?
I think we don't have a problem.
No.
We got a million problems.
Really?
Yeah.
"But, honey, I think everybody has a million problems."
"I don't know that, like, you,re supposed to solve them all, because the simple truth of it, sweetheart, is we're married."
We made a commitment to each other and to our families.
And to myself.
And I meant it.
"Shane, honey, wait."
"Jennifer, I don't need this."
I'm done with trying to make you like me.
I'm not gonna be the man you want me to be.
I'm not gonna do things the way you want me to do things.
I'm always gonna wear my heart on my sleeve because that's who I am.
And I got a lot of friends that like me just because I'm the way I am.
"This dose was much stronger, so expect to feel worse tomorrow."
Thanks for coming.
How's things?
very busy.
So let's stick to the real reason why you asked me here.
You said it was important.
I need you to loan me your share of the estate.
"I'll repay you in two years, with interest."
"I need you to help me, Nik."
Help you what?
Sort out your debts or have you found another sure-fire investment that can't lose?
I made a bad mistake with the cars.
I was tempted and I succumbed.
It was a mistake.
I admit it.
But I am tying to right that error.
Can't you see that?
I need you to believe me on this.
That requires faith that I just don't have.
There isn't anyone else I can ask.
What do you want me to do?
"I need you to just sign the papers from the solicitor, approving the release of your share of the will."
I see.
"You've made all the arrangements already, have you?"
I will pay you back.
"I'd really appreciate it, Nik."
I'll think about it.
Do you have to go so soon?
"Yeah, I've got a lot to do."
You're more interested in dead people than the living!
At least the dead don't lie.
We'd like to take a sample of your DNA.
Stop kicking me.
Ow.
Stop kicking me!
"You know, some kids don't even have one home."
Now you get to have two.
Think about that.
What I don't get was how angry Pam was.
I didn't hurt anyone but myself.
- It's not like I robbed a bank.
"-Yeah, or bombed a church."
Do you have this in an eight and a half?
- I believe we do.
I'll be right back.
- Thank you.
Or bombed a church.
"In some cultures, when you burn yourself it's a ceremony."
It's called self-immolation.
My uncle used to do it all the time.
It was a great trick.
He'd put the stuff on it and light it... and it would just go out when he went like this.
"Right before I lit it, I suddenly remembered... it's alcohol that burns but doesn't burn up."
Lighter fluid just burns.
"And then I thought, ""It's okay."
"It's better this way."""
"I just think of it as part of good service, you know?"
No.
"No, we don't touch the foot anymore."
"If you notice, we spend a lot of time touching the shoe-"
Lacing the shoe- then we just put it on the ground and watch you try to get your foot in.
"We can hand you tools- a shoehorn, a nylon sock- but we will never touch your foot with our hands."
"Now, I'll tell you what I can do."
I can press on the shoe to see if it fits.
I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds of fucking bad things.
"I mean, he's treating me like I'm a fuckin' half-a- fag or something."
I'm gonna wind up a lammist. I gotta go on the fuckin' lam to get away from this guy.
This ain't right. I can't go here or there.
You think you're the only one?
I talk to them a million times.
They don't listen.
"If you tell him, he'll stop."
I'll wind up being declared M.l.A.
"They're gonna find me in the back of a car somewhere, in the weeds?"
You've known this fuckin' Tommy all your life.
Who knows better than you?
This cocksucker's an arch criminal.
"When I leave my house in the morning, before I get to the car, I'm lookin' over both shoulders."
This is no way to live. I'm no fence jumper.
"-Tell me what I gotta do, whatever the fuck I gotta do I'm gonna do, no?"
-What could I do?
"If there was something I could do, don't you think I would do it?"
"You know me, I'd like to help you out."
Sonny...tell him what we talked about.
"Maybe you could come in with me, take a piece of this fuckin' joint. it'd be good."
What are you talking about?
You mean the restaurant?
It's a classy place.
You've been in here a million times.
Tommy taking over this fuckin' joint is like putting a silk hat on a pig.
"I don't mean any disrespect, but that's the way it is."
I'm begging you.
What can I say?
What am I going to do?
What does he want from me?
I don't know anything about the restaurant business.

"(Berta) well then, it's all set."
"They are going to the hotel San Diego.IF you are going with them, then you can talk about your plans for tomorrow."
(Julia) I can do that.
And that is how Julio and I met Linda.
"Julio, you're not coming?"
"Now I remember, I can't."
Tommorow I have a soccer game and now I have to go to the gym.
"Excuse me, but I can't accompany you now."
"See you later, eh?"
Julio is a great player in the team.
He's a great athlete.
Benito Juarez Preparatory School
The following day my sister Daniela take Linda and her mom on a tour of our school.
I'm staying here.
I need to talk with the principal.
"(Linda) Oh, ok Mom."
Daniela is going to show me the school.
Perfect!
Then you can tell everything to your classmates at school.
Until I see you later.
You guys study English here right?
"Yes, but also their culture, history, and everything!"
And my school in San Antonio we study Spanish.
"The culture, and history of Mexico."
(also)
Our school have a lot in common!
"Look, there's Julio."
"Hi,"
"""Father, mother, this man shall be my wife."""
(Whistling)
Thank you.
(Applause)
Marker.
I'm afraid to open any doors around here.
"And five, six, seven, eight."
- And one.
- Liberian Girl
You came and you changed my world
"You know, Whoopie, it'd be a blast if Michael asked me to dance."
Liberian girl
- It's the most stupid thing-- - He went on Oprah's show the next day.
He told everybody I was going to make him into another Michael Jackson.
Liberian girl
You know that you came
And you changed my world
Just like in the movies
Two lovers in a scene
Then she says Do you love me
And he says so endlessly
"I love you, Liberian girl"
Who's directing this?
Maybe we could have some rolled up with some kind of string... that I could like pull him up.
Liberian girl
"I know this is kind of loose, but do you know what we're supposed to be doing?"
All I know is that Michael called me.
"I guess when he gets here, he'll let me know what we're supposed to do."
- You won.
"- Well, hey-- Is Mike here?"
"No, but I think Bubbles is here."
That's one of the Cosby kids.
Anybody want some granite?
"My name is Randy Raisides, and this is Kenneth V. Fletcher's house."
Giant I-beam... basket with grapes... pipe bender... a billion boxes.
He's kind of a hoarder.
"I moved here four years ago, a terrible drug addict."
"And in four years, Ken has done two things."
"He has sobered me up, and he has lost everything."
Good morning.
Ken:
Good morning.
Randy:
Kenneth V. Fletcher.
Ken:
Loser.
Enabler.
What else?
Destitute human being.
Randy:
"Tomorrow Ken leaves for the Canary Islands, where he has gotten a job as a massage therapist."
"And I go back to Nebraska, where I'm going to be living with my folks."
He's one of those guys that has a billion ideas and never completes any of them.
Ken wanted a piano as a kid.
Ken couldn't get a piano as a kid.
"So three years ago, we looked on Craigslist all summer and went over to the Twin Cities and got pianos!"
[Ken playing mid-tempo melody]
The man's a genius.
He just never quite had the time.
It looks like the auctioneer's here.
[creaking]
[crash]
man:
What's in my pocket?
"Madam Noh, please help me."
Please help me find my daughter quietly.
Do you know who took your daughter?
That...
You should know him as well.
The one who was killed as an insurgent.
The illegitimate son of the Interior Minister!
Hong Gil Dong!
Is he still alive?
You must find her quietly for me.
She is the only daughter of the core of all power!
No one must ever know she is with him.
And everyone that is found with her...
Silence them forever.
Do you understand?
So the one who blocked the police was Hong Gil Dong?
Did the prince know this?
He told us that someone would block the police so that we can attack Choi Chul Joo.
I am sure he knew.
So the reason he gave up the explosives and stopped the ship was... ... because of Hong Gil Dong!
He has interfered with our plans yet again.
- Go and find the Councilor's daughter.
"- Yes, Madam!"
The illegitimate son of the Interior Minister and the only daughter of the Second State Councilor...?
We may have found a better weapon than the explosives.
- Search the area carefully!
"- Yes, Sir."
- Search the empty houses too!
"- Yes, Sir."
Hurry!
Miss Eun Hye!
"For you, I will lay down my life!"
There's a place where you throw in coins and make wishes.
I made many wishes.
First wish was 'Please let B.A.P have a hit.'
Second wish was 'Please let our hair designer get married'
And the third wish was 'Please let our make-up artist get married too'
"I wasn't going to say this but, honestly, I wished for many chances"
To see many BABAz.
I think I threw in coins worth about 5 dollars.
"Well most importantly, the MV has to come out well."
We have to finish off the concerts in
Korea and Japan successfully too.
Take this energy from Central Park...
This is awesome.
None
Americans seem to know how to appreciate the small things in life.
We're so used to internet and machines.
We should stop getting used to them
And become appreciative people.
"I will try, too."
We're going to Time Square now.
Yong Guk is filming his scene at Time Square.
I've only seen it on TV.
Like in 'lnfinite Challenge' kind of TV shows. or other entertainment programs.
I've always wanted to visit.
And I get to go today.
I'm excited.
"Yo, New York City."
"We're here, in NY."
There's so much to do.
"Hogwarts kid, move."
We're here in NY.
I said move Hogwart!
It is an earthquake!
(RUMBLE!
CRASH!)
Come on.
You'll stay with me until you get back on your feet...foot.
"Wait, he was so close with his mom."
"No, Denise."
It's genetic.
"Oh, no you're not!"
I am.
Our short webseries tells these stories.
Real stories.
You married the whiny bitch.
"Well, we made them up, but they'll remind you of folks you know."
Speaking of horse c*ck
This seriously hurts my titties.
Mine too!
She has a condition.
She does.
It's so wet!
A Series of Unfortunate People
We're gonna need back up.
The walls are closing in on me!
Now.
Mekong:
Watch That River!
This is the Mekong
One of Asia's major rivers and the 12th longest in the world
"It nurtures a great deal of life in its waters and in the wetlands, forests, towns, and villages along its path"
The Mekong's long journey begins in the Tibetan highlands
"It flows through China's Yunan province and then across Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia before entering the sea from Southern Vietnam"
"It's a journey of nearly 5,000 kilometers or some 3,000 miles"
I've seen many skateboarders since yesterday. our youngest Zelo also likes to skateboard.
"Board shop, board shop!"
"Here, it seems like a routine."
"Just as we go bike riding, people here seem to enjoy skateboarding."
Look at the camera.
None
"Since the U.S. is a really big nation, the roads and buildings are all big"
I can tell why Americans are so relaxed.
"I heard in America, people eat burgers and shakes together."
There aren't many people yet in Korea who eat like that.
"- Yes there is, Yong Guk."
"- Yes, Yong Guk eats like that."
We will give it a try today.
"At Shake Shack, they eat burgers and shakes together."
"Usually, people drink coke."
"Well, that's what they say."
Why don't you all try it too?
I hear strawberry shakes are delicious.
I felt this last time too...
The clouds in America are so beautiful.
I think I can see them more clearly because there aren't too many tall buildings. one two three.
We're in America.
"one more time, one more time."
"Hurry, one more time."
"oK, the red light is on."
I'm at a coffee shop.
"This is a mango smoothie, sold only in this store."
None
I don't know where everybody else went.
oh!
There's Zelo.
"Yo, what's up!"
"Of course, I got carried away a little bit after that."
No harm or nothing done.
It was just innocent.
We thought it was just normal innocent stuff.
"What about the music, speaking of the dance."
Who played music at that time around here?
That would have been
Jule Gillespie and Pat Bonner and
Walter McCauley.
"Maybe Robert Palmer, Edward's brother."
"Russell, one of the [?] guys or something."
There's a lot of people - a lot of them can make music
Family type stuff...
Jules - Mary's mother...
Mary can sing.
Mary Palmer.
If you can ever get her to sing.
"Richie Gillespie is a good singer, if you can ever get him to sing."
"He used to - twenty years ago him and Rich [?] could - you name it, they'd play it."
Richie'd sing as good as anybody you've ever heard.
"But Jules's wife, she could sing too."
She was a real good singer.
What kind of music?
Just the regular stuff that you hear on the tapes.
The country type or whatever you want to call it.
Were anybody left that actually did any step dance?
Mm-hmm.
The Dodie guys would just ... wife here a couple weeks ago...
Uncle Joe [?]
"Gallagher, and Uncle John he lived over where [?] is."
He was a big guy.
"Not quite like me, but big guy."
"If you won, our model will won."
"And with it's victory, the company will win."
"Your house will be made, your dream house."
Wow!
What a horoscope!
Planets are very firm at their positions... ...facing some obstacles too... ...which means the girl is very adamant.
- That's right.
She'll do love marriage.
Boy's name will start with J.
That means Jimmy.
- Yes.
"This year, the boy will take part in some air competition... ...and win the first prize."
And he'll earn fame in the world.
He'll be her husband.
Air competition?
"Yes, I remember."
Motor cycle race.
Tomorrow is Sunday.
And there's going to be a motorcycle race.
I stood first in Singapore for consecutive 3 years.
And I'll definitely take part in this race.
"Yes, son and do come first."
This is a question of our reputation.
Yes.
This race is of 30 miles distance from Mumbai to Panvel.
And 21 motorbikes across the world are taking part.
"Number 9, Mr. Jaikishan from Escort."
"Motorbike, Rajdoot 350."
Number 16.
Mr. Jimmy Thapa from Singapore.
Jimmy!

And I havebe there as a witness.
"How are you going to go,Mahir?"
I have to ..
I have to go and join my fatherat the hearing to set him free .
Good morning.
"the court hearings is today, right?"
Why are you so nervous...
You'll see Mahirand his family .. surely I have been informed about it...
Perhaps your visitinfluenced him ..
Perhaps your visitinfluenced him...
The Lord's so lucky.
Look at the things He's getting.
"Earlier, people would keep it in a covered platter.. ..in front of Him."
But now they're feeding Him.
Let Him enjoy.
It's your fault.
"Mumbai just experienced a slight earthquake tremor.. ..of 3.5 Richter scale, which didn't cause.. ..any harm to life or property."
See.
Heard that?
But a shop in the flea market has collapsed.. ..which was closed at that time.
Must be Mohammad's shop.
According to our sources.. ..the shop was registered to Mr. Kanji Lalji Mehta.
"It's really surprising, because.. ..there are other old shops in this market which are still intact."
But Kanji Lalji Mehta's shop has been completely destroyed.
"This is Shweta Tiwari, with cameraman Vaibhav Mishra, ABP News."
"Sister, switch on ABP News quickly."
We saw.
Brother-in-law's shop is gone.
It's collapsed.
Pravin!
"- Calm down, father."
"No, sister."
Come there with the children.
I'm coming there with father and the others.
- Yes.
"Yes, we're coming."
We're coming.
The idols of Gods have gone underneath.
The shop is completely ruined
Doesn't seem like there was ever a shop here.
What are you saying?
We had goods worth 25 lakhs.
Don't tell the kids.
"Nick, who I found yesterday,  kissing a woman passionately in the street..."
He later claimed that woman was his wife!
[laughter]
Here's to the future.
Drugs... sex... divorce...
Death!
Who'd want to live anywhere else?
Here's to us.
[clink]
Try me again and I promise you  it'll be more fun this time.
"- Hey, everybody!"
Welcome to the Atheist Experience.
We're live.
"It is July 15th, 2012."
"Two days after Friday 13th, and one day after Saturday the 14th, and three days after Thursday the 13th, and they're all equally important."
I'm Matt Dillahunty.
Joining me this week is Don Baker.
Welcome.
- Good to be here.
-We're in a good mood.
"This is a live call in television program out of Austin, Texas."
We'll have the number up for you shortly.
"The announcement stuff has kind of been sidelined, and we're going to go ahead and let Don get started on his talk."
"How are you, by the way?"
- I'm doing good.
"I went to a holy place, believe it or not."
"- Holy to you, or holy to somebody else?"
It's as close as atheists have to a holy place.
I went to a great science museum.
"I went to the American Museum of Natural Science in New York City, where the Hayden Planetarium is."
"I didn't see Neil deGrasse Tyson there, but took in a great planetarium show."
-That's impossible!
-How come?
That's the surveillance panel.
It can detect even a little bird.
Then how did the elephant enter?
We will investigate it later.
Later isn't enough.
Another similar accident will...
"Anyhow, you should hurry and finish rebuilding Zora."
I can't take it anymore!
"Doctor Hura, so you don't mind getting wild animals killed?"
"If I didn't invent animal robots, more wild animals would have been killed by humans!"
Help!
"Wow, Zora moved."
Help!
Help!
My gosh.
I can't do anything now.
It's beyond curbs.
Atom is the only one who can take care of this situation.
"Pura, not ready yet?"
It's evening already.
"Pura, do you understand?"
"I don't want Doctor Ochanomizu to worry, so I'm going to go tell him what happened and come back."
So please wait here for a moment.
I'll soon be back.
"You are late, Atom."
Sorry?
So Doctor Ochanomizu already went out with Doctor Hura to find me?
This is great.
Where would Doctor Ochanomizu be?
"Ah, that's..."
Loooook!
These are our wedding pictures.
"You are the groom, I am the bride."
Whole Guzelyurt was there.
Everybody admired the gold jewellery given to me.
They said this land had not seen such a beautiful bride for years...
"Yes, take a good look at me."
Do you remember you hit me?
I wanted you to give me a present to see my unveiled face...
And you hit me in the face.
Mustafa Bulut...You are something...
You can't run away like this...
You will remember each one of them...
And then you will answer to me.
I won't forgive you unless you kiss ten times every part of my body you hit.
Welcome... and good bye.
Visiting time is over.
"Today, there were too many people coming and going."
"Mustafa brother, it is time for your medication."
You are loved by beautiful women.
One comes while the other leaves.
Mustafa...
"Where are you going, son?"
Mustafa...
Please look at me.
Son...
My child...
"Hug your father once, eh?"
Hug your father...
Mustafa held the sling and you should have seen it...
Everybody in the garden dispersed.
But he had already set his eyes on someone.
"And I said, why me?"
He said but you're future because it's so immaterial.
"So, let's talk about asteroids."
Just a few lines of code.
Create a new XMLHttpRequest object like before.
"We call request.open again, pretty much the same except that we've changed weapon.jsan to bgmenu.ogg, and we set request.responseType to be arraybuffer."

Tenant:

Friend:
What did it say?
Tenant:
My dad's gay.
Friend:
"I knew it, those blood tests don't lie. *somebody knocking the door*"
Friend:

Tenant:
"Its my landlord, Pearl."
I'm really late on my rent.
Friend:

Tenant:
"No No No,"
"Please, you need to stay."
"Look, Muko has just confirmed it."
Please...
Eh?
Ok...
Let's try.
"Then Bahar Hanim, please be ready early in the morning tomorrow."
I won't even sleep.
"Your fate, your medicine is here Mustafa..."
When dawn breaks
I put my head down
"And, get lost in far off places"
Becoming sad.
Don't ask how I am...
Don't ask..
I am miserable..
Don't ask..
I am in flames from time to time...
"Don't ask, I am ashamed..."
Don't ask..
I can't tell you...
"Don't ask, I am in hell..."
"- Good, at least, he cheered up..."
- Yes...
They say music is the nutriotion for the soul.
"Bahar Hanim is very talented, praise be!"
"You set it up, I'll come again..."
"If you are going to give a concert like this every time,  then I would bring you every day."
"Even if it isn't every day, it would be time to time, at least..."
"Do you remember What I told you before you came here, Mustafa?"
I said that she would be no longer where you look at  and you would see only me.
"Look, I am here now."
You understand?
"We're happy, free, confused,"
"And lonely in the best way,"
It's miserable and magical.
Oh yeah!
"Tonight's the night when, We forget about the heartbreaks,"
"It's time, uh-oh!"
"I don't know about you,"
But I'm feeling twenty-two!
"Everything will be alright if, (Ooh), you keep me next to you."
"You don't know about me,"
"But I'll bet you want to,"
"Everything will be alright if, (Alright), we just keep dancing,"
"Like we're twenty-two, (oh-uh-uh-uh-oh),"
Twenty-two!
(I don't know about you)!
"Twenty-two, twenty-two!"
It feels like one of those nights!
We ditch the whole scene.
It feels like one of those nights!
We won't be sleeping.
It feels like one of those nights!
"You look like bad news,"
"I gotta have you, I gotta have you!"
"Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, yeah, hey!"
"I don't know about you, (I don't know about you)!"
But I'm feeling twenty-two!
"Everything will be alright if, (Ooh), you keep me next to you."
"You don't know about me, (You don't know about me)!"
"But I'll bet you want to,"
"Everything will be alright if,"
"We just keep dancing, (dance like we're),"
"Like we're twenty-two, (oh-woah-oh),"
Eh?
Three... five times...
They are giving you ECT (Electroconvulsive Therapy).
Very gently...
You should have seen the electric shocks that I was given...
You couldn't stand it even while watching.
This is nothing...
For seven years...
I was given electric shock.
They fried us with electricity in Diyarbakir prison.
I smelled the burning of my own flesh.
"They made us into human kabobs, Mustafa..."
And then what?
Don't you be afraid.
You don't die from electricity.
You die from loneliness.
You die if you are not loved...
"How did you get the rich Mustafa, eh?"
"Do you get a good tip, eh?"
Serve him well...
This is a whale family...
"Let's stay away from this piece of shit, Mustafa..."
"Yesterday, I was looking at old pictures..."
"Look what I found, Asil."
Look what Mustafa did.
"The world will never see another man like Musto, dude..."
I pushed him around the garden in his wheelchair for about an hour.
"Now, he is yours."
I'll go and check the tea house.
Sahan...
"Shame on you; put it back into your pocket, brother..."
You give it to the poor...
Why do you wish to know?
No reason
"I fear for his safety, that is all"
"I'm sworn to protect him as well as yourself, Your Majesty"
"Thank you, Rufio"
For your loyalty
There were supposed to be only six legions!
"lmperator, we must withdraw"
"Have you lost your courage, General?"
It's not a question of courage
These are Roman soldiers
It's not right for them to have to fight their fellow countrymen
"We fight to win, Commander?"
We fight to win!
Charge!
Anthony!
Get Olympos!
We must get Caesarian out of the city now!
"Caesarian, Caesarian!"
You're going on a trip
"A beautiful ship is going to take you to lndia, a land of many wonders"
Aren't you coming with me?
"No, Mama has to stay here"
Are you going to die?
No
I don't want you to die!
I don't want to go!
What news?
We couldn't stop them...too many!
Octavius is coming!
You must go my son
You know why?
Are you all sure?
"I'll book it if you promise never to chant ""Bahamas"" again."
Okayt
"All right, thank you."
It's done
"Block of rooms, garden view."
"Wait a second, garden view?"
That's the opposite of ocean view
"Hey, foxy lady want to come back to my garden view room"
I asked for the garden
The nose from### the ocean keep me up at night
So what the noise from my foxy lady if I had an ocean view room
"Stacey, any chance the national's media picked up on this story with the media"
I gotta go.
"The mayor pulled an ""Uncle Louie"" last night."
Nothing national but did you see the headline in the post
His honor was on her.
Very clever
"Jason's### really killing us, sorry Mike"
Doesn't matter.
It's under control.
I got Jason coming over### here right now
Jason is coming up here?
Damn I hate this tie
Carter
Great tie
"Listen, Jason, about this story in the morning paper"
"I thought it was great, by the way"
You didn't think it was too wordy?
Why are you so hard on yourself?
You're so talented...

And haggle for just paisa 50 a dozen.
It's a long story.
- How long?
Its 5ft 7 inches long.
"People normally get married to fortunate, lucky and virtuous girls."
But I got a spendthrift wife.
She has changed the entire meaning of expenditure.
She spends my money like water flows.
Sometimes she shops for so long.. ..that she takes a blanket and a pillow.. ..and sleeps in the Home Department of the mall.. ..so that she can get up again in the morning and start shopping.
I'm done with shopping for small things.
The real shopping..
I will do it tomorrow.
Not just that.
If the stereo of the car doesn't work.. - She buys a new stereo.
"No, she buys a new car."
And look.
Do you see this dress?
Its worth 2.5 lakhs.
She says that Mallika Sherawat wore this dress in 'Murder'.
What do you say?
- Mallika Sherawat wore a dress in 'Murder'.
When?
- That's exactly what I say.
That's why I come here from Lokhandwala... ...to buy cheap fruits and vegetables.
"Brother, I pray that even Osama Bin Laden.. ..doesn't get a wife like mine."
"Oh, God."
- You intentionally ruined the dress.
"Mala, why would I do anything like that?"
Because you don't want me to look pretty.
That isn't possible anyway.
"Whether I do something or not, it would make no difference."
Let's do it again.
- All right.
Last and final tour of the lmperial Drama and Comedy Theatre soloist.

You can hear the cock At break of day:

"I see my cow, Nyurka, and a piece of paper on her horn."
"It said: "" Here's your cow, Aunt Darya."

And the opportunity to review is a good way to learn also.
Absolute.
As an author.
Absolutely.
So Yeah.
Yeah so.
Great.
Is there any parting thoughts or tips that you want to offer to the class?
"No, I think we've covered [laugh]"
Great.

"Yeah, you've matured, actually-- actually, in the last year or so quite good into a real proper lad, a real gentleman and a nice boy."

He'll take care of your Jedi problem.
And by the way. what kind of wood polish did you use on this table?

"Master, let's throw these girls a Jedi surprise party."
Right.

There's the blockade!
Uh oh!
Guys!
It's a DUI checkpoint!
"Perhaps, is it because I came in?"
Are you leaving because of me?
"Anyways, it has nothing to do with you."
Don't relate everything to yourself.
What do you mean you're leaving this house?
"Until now, under your supervision..."
I have lived comfortably.
But I think it's now time to think about the path ahead of me.
"Just once, living by myself, getting a part time job..."
I want to throw myself into an absolutely unprotected world and watch over myself.
What kind of person am I?
What can I do?
Okay.
That's not a bad idea.
"Aigoo, but still..."
It hasn't been long since Ha Ni has come back.
"Hey, Seung Jo."
It has nothing to do with her.
It's my life.
Okay.
"Go try it out. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; What should I do? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; Seung Jo is going to move out of this house. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; I came back into this house. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; But this time, Seung Jo... &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; is going to leave. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Brought to you by the PKer team @ www.viikii.net"
Where is Baek Seung Jo?
"If I don't try,"
We couldn't even meet like this.
"It's Seung Jo. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; Seung Jo, what are you doing by yourself? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; In what area are you living right now?"
"Hey, Baek Seung Jo."
"Since she doesn't have a chance, tell her to give up."
Tell her like a man.
Seung Jo!
All of a sudden...
It must be lonely living by yourself.
Well it doesn't seem all that bad since I'm with Yoon Hae Ra.

But it's the picture that I'm
looking for today.
"Okay, so the row picture."
"All right, so I'm in three dimensions, x,"
y and z.
And I want to take those equations one at a time and ask --
and make a picture of all the points that satisfy --
let's take equation number two.
If I make a picture of all the
"points that satisfy -- all the x, y, z points that solve"
"this equation -- well, first of all,"
"the origin is not one of them. x, y, z -- it being 0, 0, 0 would"
not solve that equation.
So what are some points that do
solve the equation?
"Let's see, maybe if x is one,"
y and z could be zero.
"That would work, right?"
So there's one point.
"I'm looking at this second equation, here, just, to start"
with.
Let's see.
"Also, I guess,"
"if z could be one, x and y could be zero,"
so that would just go straight up that axis.
"And,"
probably I'd want a third point here.
"Let me take x to be zero,"
"z to be zero, then y would be minus a half, right?"
"So there's a third point, somewhere -- oh my -- okay."
Let's see.
I want to put in all the points that satisfy that
Everything I worked hard for is happening.
Isn't that part I'm supposed to be happy
Hail
Hey Daddy
First day of your sophomore year.
You're growing up too fast
"Brook, you start making your old man look old"
"Listen, when I get back, what do you say we stop by doctor you know just to touch base##."
It's been a while since we've seen him.*
"Daddy, I'm fine."
I don't need to say him
I stopped by the store on the way home picked up the requested item*
"Dad, I told you..."
I use the kind with wings.
"But these came with , i thought you'd like that."
How long are you gonna be gone this time?**
I'm gonna reorganize the clients' portfolio in New York.
I should be back on Sunday.
I left all the phone numbers with Clara*
I just wanted to go to my routine with you
Are you cutting classes?
My cheerleading routine.
I told you about it.
Just let go.
I'll get it
"Just let go, okay?"
"Brooke', I mean look at me."
I'm trying
"Hey,"
I'm so worshipping your Gwynethness
"So Calvin, but hi, Brooke mutual admiration society is screeching to a dead halt*"
What?
"It pissed me off when she did that, and she does it on purpose"
"She knows it, she's always copying me, it pisses me off!"
"Same thing, later she enters my office, she opens my drawer, she takes my pen"
"No ""thank you"", no ""excuse me"", nothing!"
"Jean, are you listening to me?"
Of course I'm listening
"No, you're not looking at me!"
Well I'm sorry but I listen with my ears.
It seems strange but...
Very funny...
"By the way, I should probably clean them, cause it seems like I'm only hearing stupidities"
Strange huh?
I won't tell you anything anymore!
"Oh no Alex, I love your stories so much..."
Really?
So...
"The day after, the day after..."
"Oh, Loulou, I gotta pee"
"Oh, no, Alex, it's only been half an hour since we left"
"Oh, I need to pee, I must pee, I have to pee"
Have you ever thought about wearing a diaper before travelling?
"But, Loulou, I was careful this morning"
"I didnt' have any coffee, orange juice or water, nothing, so that I wouldn't need to pee"
Well what are you peeing then?
"Oh, Loulou, can't you stop at a gas station with restrooms?"
"No no no, I'm doing what I can, at the edge of the road, it will be fine"
"No, Loulou, I want real restrooms!"
What next?
"No, here it's fine, come on"
"No, baby, I'm gonna catch a disease"
"It'll be fine here, Alex"
Disease?
I love... cleaning something that's really dirty so you can see the result. man:

"I love the word ""mamihlapinatapai."""
"It's from the Yaghan language, which is now a dead language."
"But it was spoken in Tierra del Fuego, the very southernmost point of South America."
"I've never heard the word said properly, so I could be pronouncing it wrong."
But the meaning is quite beautiful.
"It means that moment or feeling when two people both want to initiate something, but neither wants to be the one to start it."
"It can be perhaps two tribal leaders both wanting to make peace, but neither wanting to be the one to begin it."
Or it could be two people at a party wanting to approach each other and neither quite brave enough to make the first move.

Hello? man:
Do you have a second to talk to me? woman:
Sure. man:
They cancel out.
Then you have bi times minus bi.
So that's minus b squared i squared.
These cancel out.
So you're left with a minus bi over a squared minus b squared i squared.
We know what i squared is. i squared is equal to negative 1.
You square both sides of that and you get i squared is equal to negative 1.
"So if we multiply, this becomes a negative 1."
"Every zero - this one, this one, this one and this one - that's sandwiched between them is significant."
Are these guys significant?
It's to the right.
Is there a decimal point?
There is.
1-2.
Every single one of them is significant - 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10.
10 total.
Wow!
Let's look at this long guy.
OK?
"Again, break it down."
"The 5, the 9 and the 6 we know are significant."
Which means that any zeros sandwiched between them are also significant.
The zeros coming to the left of significant numbers are never significant.
We don't have to worry about them.
There are zeros coming to the right.
Is there a decimal point in the number?
There is.
So the zeros to the right are significant because of the decimal point.
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9 - total significant figures here.
"8 - 9 significant, sandwiched zeros also, 1-2-3 to the right."
They are significant because there's a decimal point at the end.
6 total here.
And then I was working for Larry McDonough janitor work at the school.
He was the treasurer in charge of the ... there.
Where was his - ?
Grand Rapids.
So I was picking up a little money there.
And when I got done with the school at 7 or 8 o'clock at night I was painting apartment buildings until midnight and then back up again the next morning to go at it again.
You couldn't get a job.
I was making $5.50 an hour at
Steel Case.
Nobody's going to hire you.
"Because two weeks from now, Steel Case calls you back."
So the only place I get a job was to go to Spartan
Warehouse.
They paid a little more and I also had the 7 years teamster.
So then I just put my ... in his apartment and retired and came here.
Built this shack and that was it.
This house is out of styrofoam by the way.
"At Spartan, that's they way they built - Everything was out of styrofoam."
"So, Steel Case, did they call you back, then?"
"Yeah, but I was already in Spartan."
And how long did you work for Spartan?
"Oh, 24 years."
I lost some time getting a hip replaced so I had to work a little bit longer
"So you were off, away from Beaver Island, for a total of?"
"35 years, maybe."
And what brought you back here?
"Oh, hell, I never left."
Never left.
All our vacations were up there.
The kids never got out of Michigan until after - I don't know when they got old enough.
I guess when they got married.
My daughter went to Alaska and my son went to
So the total preface has less than 300 words.
"They say each paragraph of the preface, and there's 2 of them, has fewer than 150 words."
So the total preface has less than 300 words.
So we could do the same logic.
So that means that the total is going to be less than what?
The total is going to be less than the original number of words plus the preface.
"So it's going to be less than 2,600 plus 300."
"It's going to be less than 2,900."
"Then if you divide both sides by 25 to get the average, 25 goes into 2,900 really four more times."
That's rightŁż
The average is going to be less than-- let me make sure
I'm getting that right.
"So 4, 25 goes into 2,900."
"1, 25, 40, 1, 25."
Then we have 150.
25 goes into 150 six times.
So we have the average is less than 1/16.
So statement 2 alone is sufficient.
"Statement 2 tells us that the average of the words per paragraph is less than 116,which is definitely less than 120."
"So statement 2 alone is sufficient, and statement 1 doesn't help us much."
I'll run out of time.
See you in the next video.
What's up dudes?
Freddy Wong and Brandon Laatsch here.
"What time of year is it, Brandon?"
Springtime.
Springtime?
I guess that means it's time for
Rollercoaster Day 2011!
We had our first rollercoaster day in 2010.
And take a look at how awesome that went!
Where is everybody?
"And when I trained steps  to work with this program,"
I use Thay's story and some  of you may have heard this.
He talks about -would you hold the mike for me so I can demonstrate this?-
"He talks about the flower and -no, for me.- (Laughter)"
- (K. Weare)There.
"- (J. Bell) Okay, here we go."
"So, Thay - a little more to this side."
(Laughter)
"So, Thay talks about the flowers like tulips that close up at night."
"Every morning the sun comes up, beams down... (Laughter)"
It is not working.
"The flower is here, the sun is here."
(Laughter)
(K. Weare) What are you going to do now?
And the sun beams down its photons indiscriminately on the flower and its natures open up.
The story works  with young people.
"The young people came in  like this, all closed up."
"And our job as teachers, and parents, and Youth workers, is to beam down love and respect indiscriminately on what they've done."
And they begin to test it out.
Sometimes it goes like that.
(Laughter)
Sometimes it goes like that.
Sometimes it goes like that again.
But our job is their nature to open to their own health.
And they will move towards that.
"Sometimes it takes years, we know."
"We get letters from students,  10, 15 years out of Youth Build saying,"
"""Thank you, I couldn't get it then, but now I know."""
Thank you.
(Laughter)
"So,respect and caring, one is going beyond what they expect, for instance, they said it was, ""Oh yeah, they come and grab me."
They knocked on my door  when I didn't get up for school.
We've never even done anything bad to anyone for this to happen to us
"Guys, we need to calm down and figure out what we're gonna do tomorrow"
Isn't it your job to think about it?
Hello?
"Yeah, it's me"
What?
You sure?
"Okay, I'm on my way to you now!"
Thanks
Dad is in jail!
What?!
Jail?
Come on!
Come on!
"Just like I told you, we heard about a fight and we saw this man, it looked like he was gonna kill the other guy"
What was the reason behind the fight?
He told us he thought the man was gonna rob him
The guy who dad hit was a thief?
"No, he wasn't"
We searched him but found nothing
"Just like you can see, he looks decent"
"Yeah he looks decent and not like a thief, what's wrong?"
I've noticed that there's something weird about your dad
His speech pattern is odd
"I think there's something wrong with him, right?"
Yeah he has Alzheimer's
"Oh yes Alzheimer's, I thought so"
"Because when we saw Mr.Sameh's number, he didn't know whose number it was"
How do you just allow him to go out alone?
"Meem, get him out of the prison bars"
"To be honest, he's been missing for a while"
He left the house and nobody knew where he was and we kept looking for him
- I'm glad you're safe.
Have you been hurt?
That evil bastard!
- How dare he hurt my daughter!
- It wasn't his fault I was hurt.
It was my own fault.
I'm afraid that bad rumors may start.
"Now that I am safe, please inform the police to stop searching for me."
"Alright, fine."
"- Granny, take Eun Hye outside."
"- Yes, Sir."
Did you meet him?
I hope he's safe.
"Seeing how the young miss is protecting him, it seems that she has already fallen for him."
I thought you were discussing marriage between the eldest son of the Interior Minister.
Isn't Hong Gil Dong his illegitimate son?
If the marriage negotiations break down because of this...
"If they break down, the Interior Minister's relationship with me ends too!"
We must proceed with the wedding!
"If we have Eun Hye followed, we should be able to catch Hong Gil Dong."
Find him for me and get rid of him!
"If it concerns you and the Interior Minister, then of course we should help you."
Was it really him that I saw?
"No, that's impossible!"
I must have been mistaken.
I came on behalf of everyone because too many people would cause trouble.
Thank you so much.
"If people find out about us, it'll be trouble."
"Since people think that Yongmun solved this problem, let them."
- Don't spread other rumors.
- We know.
What did Yongmun do anyway?
Hoity-Toity?
He's coming here?
To see THESE dresses?
Yep!
Get ready for all of your dreams to come true.
There he is!
Okay.
"Relax, Rarity."
Your friends like their outfits and so will he.
What's wrong with the lights?!
"Oh, yes."
That means the show's starting.
Good.
Since the beginning of time the elite of Equestria have longed for pony fashions... ...that that truly expressed the essence of their very souls.
"Patiently waiting decades... no, centuries! ...for the perfect pony gown."
"Today at long last, Equestria, your wait is over!"
Let's hear it for the breathtaking designs of Ponyville's own...
Rarity!
Why's everypony lookin' at us like that?
Oh dear.
You think we overdid it?
Nah.
"Okay, maybe a little."
Those amateurish designs look like a piled-on mishmash of everything but a kitchen sink!
"It's a travesty, it's what it is."
"Those outfits are the ugliest things I've ever seen, oh for shame."
Who is responsible for subjecting our eyes to these horrors?
Not to mention wasting my valuable time.
Hide me.
"Come on out and take a bow, Rarity."
You worked really hard for this.
Yes!
It's over
I have good news for you!
Antony!
Leave us

"Oh, I thought you were dead!"
I am dead
"No...no, don't say that"
This place is like a gigantic tomb you stay here long enough one becomes mummified
You deserted me!
They told me you were dead!
What should I have done?
I saw something tonight that I could not believe
The city...in victory
I had to buy time
"To keep my people from panic, to organize a defense"
A defense?
What defense?
Octavius has defeated us completely!
He has not defeated me!
I still rule Egypt
How!
By lying to your people?
How could you let them believe we've triumphed... when we've failed so miserably?
"We'll triumph, Antony, we will make that falsehood come true"
You've humiliated me with this vile hypocrisy!
As if I haven't been humiliated enough!
Be quiet!
Your men will hear you!
My men?
What men?
The bottom of the sea is littered with the bones of my men

"Oh no, it gets worse."
You've been warned.
[people laughing]
"Wow, that Ugandan pastor would not approve of such behavior."
"Ugh, this video is some s--t, ain't it?"
So to speak.
Why did you guys make me review that?
"And more than that, why is the other elephant just sitting there like,"
"-Yeah, go ahead."
Stick your trunk in there.
"Oh, very nice."
"-Ugh, I don't know."
Maybe that's how this guy gets his peanuts.
"Oh, why did I make that joke?"
"All right, that's it guys."
"Don't make me review anymore videos of nasty turd-burgling elephants, all right?"
"Okay, so I actually do have something interesting for you."
"It's one of those things that's kind of racist but kind of f--ked up, but also kind of funny."
And it's just a commercial for a local mattress store.
"-Hi, I'm Gary."
At the one and only Gary's Mattress.
Now with locations in Koreatown and Little Tokyo.
We are karate-a-chopping a-prices just for you!
Oh cho!
Even we would buy it.
"At Gary's Mattress, we're blowing up prices!"
Yayayaya!
"-Wow, that is unfortunate."
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that I wouldn't buy mattresses from that guy.
"I mean, who's your target demographic when you trash everyone?"
- And she knows we're Kerim's friends...
"- Please, I don't want to hear anything."
Thank you.
He should be here soon.
Our phones kept ringing since the morning.
Everyone who saw it on the Internet dialed our number.
You can imagine how difficult a situation it was for us.
"It's indeed difficult, having to defend ourselves against such a groundless and ugly claim."
- I can't believe we're even talking about it.
- Exactly...
Exactly.
I'm disgraced before all my friends.
I have been believing your lies closing my ears to what others said...
But I don't know how I am going to deal with this!
I've never lied to you.
Even if it's denied and refuted... ... the question marks in people's heads will remain.
"Even today, my best friend told me  ""There's no smoke without fire""."
To hell with their smoke and fire!
You'll keep hearing such things if you don't shut them up!
After all I've told you...
Is this how much you trust me?
Do you think I could possibly do something like this?
Meltem...
That girl was Kerim's girlfriend.
"Would she marry him, if she wasn't?"
Meltem...
That news are set up by my father's rivals.
Everyone in that town knows that.
It's OK.
Leave it.
"Welcome, dad."
Welcome dear.
"Which hospital, what happened to you? :"
Finally I ran off the rails.
Your lawyer knows it.
"What happened, didn't he tell you?"
"No, nobody told me anything."
Why are you at the hospital?
"Anyway, leave it now Yaman."
I need money.
Tomorrow the committee will have a meeting.
"They will decide, they will decide if I am crazy or not."
I have to please someone so that he gives me a sick certificate for being crazy. what are you saying man?
"Yaman, listen to your brother."
"I can't return to jail, if I return I will really go crazy."
"Until tomorrow until midday you find 1000 TL and bring it to me, OK?"
Hello?
Yaman?
"I am not asking if you can find it,i'm saying..find it and bring it."
"Yaman, it's very important, please!"
Where are you?
Which hospital?- My lion!
This is it!
Good morning &amp;gt; Same to you.
"You are so excited, look at your state.-Don't touch me."
"Suzan, today the men will come, you check the invoice, it must be around 500 TL..."
"OK, Mr Selim, don't worry at all."
I won't pay it without having the invoice
Thanks!
"If there is something, you call me."
"While we are here, my sail has to be renovated too."
"Fall in the middle as soon as you find a chance, of course, don't wait at all."
How much do you need?- 8040 EUR
Where am I going to get so much money for you Mert?
We're going to film the first Las Vegas scene.
We suffered a lot until now in the U.S. because of the weather.
But I think it'll be okay in Las Vegas.
Although I am quite sleepy and that's not good.
What time is it now?
I couldn't fall asleep so I read a book instead.
There's nowhere to film here.
There should be a lot out there.
"For Las Vegas,"
This is where everything really starts.
None
None
None
It's a song about us B.A.P.
We wanted a song that matched Las Vegas.
It's a very fancy city.
"Since we are singers, we look the most splendid when we're up on stage."
It's a song about us and how we'll go to many cities in many countries to perform on stage.
There are many countries we want to go to
And there are many countries we will go to.
So it's a song that contains our greatest aspirations.
It's so pretty since the streets are so extravagant.
I'm not sure I did well.
There are too many people.
I'm nervous because too many people are watching.
None
I'm embarrassed.
It's crazy.
lf I were good at dancing then I would at least do something.
Singing is more embarrassing than dancing for some reason.
People are all staring...
So it's kind of hard to be confident.
"Ninja Turtles ill walks in place, and 1943 just fidgets around a lot."
It's another hunk of plastic!
Who made this thing?
Son of a bitch...
"Well, we might as well try an LJN game."
"Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice!"
Let's see if this works.
"No, of course not."
It doesn't.
It doesn't work.
It just doesn't work.
I need a beer.
I'm drinking Rolling Rock... ...on the Roll &amp;amp; Rocker!
Rolling Rock... ...Roll &amp;amp; Rocker!
"Yeah, Rolling Rock, on the Roll &amp;amp; Rocker!"
"I've also heard that you can't weigh more than a hundred pounds, but I still don't understand why I can't get any kind of response out of it."
Let's try the cat.
"Get on there, ya little bastard."
"Cat's like, ""Fuck that shit!"""
"Even though the Roll &amp;amp; Rocker does absolutely nothing, the B and A buttons still work."
"Yeah, you plug the regular controller into it,"
"So while you're standing on the thing, you still use the B and A buttons like normal."
"So even if it did work, what's the point?"
"If I'm holding the controller anyway, why not just use the controller?"
"It blows my mind, it's like, what were they thinking?"
"One more, the U-Force."
"So hot, nothing can touch it."
Nothing comes between you and the game.
That's what the advertisement said.
"You open the thing up, it basically looks like electronic Battleship."
It's got a three-dimensional invisible power field.
"Wow, a power field?"
Approximate.
Did you find anything on that flight?
No.
"No, not that I remember, no."
"Of course, the thing I remember most was that landing."
I thought that was absolutely great.
Yes.
Frozen brake and 180.
"Yeah, and then have to run another runway."
"Like I said, He didn't let it bend or whatever"
"Now, the next day"
"I don't know if it was the next day or not, but you mentioned that the bodies started washing -"
"Yeah, even that first day they were picking some up."
"And the second day when we were at the Coast Guard station, yeah."
"They brought in the boats, you know."
"Smaller boats, and the 40-footers..."
"And there might have even been some private boats, I'm not sure."
"I can't remember, but they were consolidating at the Coast Guard"
Station.
But they were bringing the bodies in.
You could see them bringing them in.
They'd be in the fetal position.
For warmth.
I don't think they got them all.
I don't know how many there was but there was enough that -
"That's what they would do, obviously, when they froze to death."
"When they drowned and froze to death or both, a combination, I imagine."
That's bad.
"Hell, about two of them were from Rogers City."
"They left 50, 60 kids and stuff."
It was...
It wasn't anybody from the Island here on it.
Then there is nothing we can do.
"It was Narin who tied Mustafa's mind, then she will be the one who would untie it."
"You say that we should bring Narin, don't you?"
"I thought about it, too, but..."
I haven't said anything.
"Very well, but who is going to ask Narin?"
Take it easy!
-Welcome!
-Welcome!
- Take it easy!
- Welcome Yasar - Thank you.
How nice that you've started cleaning here.
This place is important for Guzelyurt.
There aren't many places like this that people can use.
"I love this place very much, too."
How is your brother?
"In fact, I came here for him."
I am going to ask you something difficult.
My brother doesn't recognize or remember anybody;  my mother... my father... me... his friends... no one...
It must be because he is taking a lot of medicine.
They say so...But they say he shut himself off completely and doesn't talk at all.
He doesn't even eat.
The doctor says that visitors whom he knows will be helpful but...
"He only recognized Narin, from a picture."
It will be very helpful if Narin visits my brother.
"Well, what do you want from me?"
"Doctor Bey, we can't ask Narin this."
"If you ask her as a doctor, maybe she would be convinced."
"How could you ask me something like this, Yasar?"
I've already been involved enough in your family affairs.
And I've paid the price for this greatly.
"Your mother, father, everybody see me as their enemy,"
Good.
Um.
"Two uh, galleries, online galleries, and stuff like that."
Mm-hm.
"But, I have some real good stuff on there, but."
"You know, we have um, an interesting series, it's, it's um, Wordpress."
"But, we are doing an interesting series with one of our authors, uh, Morton Ran Hendrickson."
"And he's doing this series called Start With A Theme, and he looks at three free Wordpress themes."
And ah looks at how to tweak them best for your website and the one that j ust released was on creative portfolios.
"Oh so you can actually, so you know if there's some advice on how to tweak them."
"Oh, that'd be great."
"Yeah, so, he did one on um, photography portfolios, and then the one that just came out yesterday I think is creative portfolios, and then he's doing another one this fall, on, um."
Magazines.
Styles.
Oh.
Magazine work.
I'd be interested in that one.
Yeah.
"My husband and I have a podcast, uh, uh, and we're using WordPress to kinda fix the audio thing."
Uh.
It's very hard to find a WordPress that actually has a good audio for the internet.
Um.
"We're having an earthquake. , Hm?"
We're having an earthquake.
Usgs?
What?
Yeah.
Oh right now?
"Uh-huh. , check on the USGS's website."
Have you been on the earthquake site?
I always am on the earthquake site.
"Is there, is there an immediate uh?"
I accept this beautiful death.
"Don""t say that, Mr. Rajesh."
You still have to achieve a lot.
A police officer has to play with life and death.
All that is fine.
First finish your dinner.
"lt""s enough!"
"I have to do some work too. shall we, Mr. Diwan? of course."
"Let""s go!"
David!
"- Yes, sir. okay, sir."
Mr. Rajesh.. this is the area.. where smuggling takes place.
Police and custom have raided this place many times.
But no clue was found. one thing is definite.
The smugglers dwell here only.
Yes.
"I entirely agree with you, Mr. Diwan."
These people have ruined the economy of the country.
They smuggle gold.. and shake.. ..the foundation of the government.
But who are these people?
They belong to this country only.
"They dance on other""s tunes."
"And they are leading to our country""s downfall."
This is some big international gang. such people should be shot!
They are not lndians!
They are traitors!
They have no nationality and no community!
Why are you worried?
"As we sow, so shall we reap."
"You don""t know, mother. lt""s about our country""s honour."
lf I had my way I would force all lndian mothers.. ..to first explain national character to their children!
To teach him to lay down their lives for their country!
Probably 50 feet high
There's a picture of the ice house right there.
They put it right up to the heaves.
You can imagine how much - how many tons and tons of ice would be in there.
500 pound case.
"That was to supply the whole island all summer, or?"
"Yeah, in the 40s, yeah."
Probably 90% of them.
There wasn't that many refrigerators then.
"And in the 50s, you got more."
"But the people still that owned refrigerators, there weren't much size to them or anything."
"And even if the people got one, their old ice boxes, I still delivered a lot of ice."
"They delivered every day, pretty much."
Who did?
Dad.
And he knew every size of every ice box.
"One day he might be going along the harbor, next day he'd be out different places."
"Of course, there wasn't any out here then."
"But, Brother's, they'd take a couple hundred pounds every day."
Couple wash tubs.
"One would be full of the pop and stuff, and the other the cooks would use for the lettuce and -"
The Christian Brothers?
Yeah.
The hotels.
Talk a little bit about the Christian
Brothers at that time.
What were they like?
"Oh, real nice friendly guys"
They come here - there'd be two batches.
"I think 40 at a time, maybe."
40 rings a bell.
And then there was - they had a German guy and his wife were the cooks.
And we brought it all to bankruptcy.
"Of course, all the creditors - We tried to get our members their money back."
"Ten cents on the dollar, and they did."
Some of it was interesting.
How did you and De meet then?
I flew down on a Thursday and caught the Friday and Saturday and when I came back I picked up a case of some Irish whiskey.
I knew that a bunch of friends of ours were having a St. Patrick's Day party.
"So we flew in, I grabbed a jug and went on over there and she was making some salads or doing something like that."
She was looking pretty good.
One thing led to another and that was it.
"She had a background on the island, with her family?"
"She knew some friends, that was it."
The friends that she was at...
Maria [?] was married a guy from here.
And different people
They all went to school.
These were the nurses.
They were having a party.
"She wasn't there, but it was the people that she graduated with."
There was a bunch of them that used to stick together.
[?]
"Cole, Donald Cole's wife,"
Ellen [?].
She was one of them.
"So was De a nurse, too?"
"No, she was an executive secretary."
"She hung out with some Beaver Island nurses, and that was her only connection?"
"Yep, she'd never been to the island."
But then she went to Detroit.
I was sparking her for about a year but I wasn't
looking for that ring yet.
But of course she went to
You wouldn't be writing about mortality.
And then so.
Right.
You don't have to say that.
"I mean, things that are sort of obvious, don't say it."
"Just say the important limitations of your study, the important strengths."
"And, you don't have to label them as strengths and limit."
"It's sort of a jargon now, every epidemiologic paper, you have to find the word limitation."
[laugh].
"Yes, yes."
"Or, you know, just, state what they are."
"Yeah, yeah, good."
"So, I guess, You, you know, I guess just avoid making your paper seem like a, a thesis."
Yeah I've encountered that as well.
I'm reviewing papers.
Yeah.
Where you can tell that a.
Somebody had taken the thesis.
Yeah.
And just tried to turn it into a paper.
It's a very different product.
Right.
"So paying attention to the, the actually writing like a paper."
Right.
He says it's a great tip.
Mm-hm.
And lets talk a little bit about resubmission.
So lets say that you're offered the opportunity.
"The, the paper's rejected but."
Mm-hm.
You're offered the opportunity to resubmit it with a lot of comments from reviewers.
Mm-hm.
How is it?
Isn't it a good name?
Would you guide me to where you first entered this park?
It would be tough if another animals enters.
This is a place for repairing hunted robots.
"Anyhow, Doctor Ochanomizu, please take a look at that."
It's a very aggressive elephant called Zora.
Very aggressive?
All animal robots here are designed not to take people's lives.
"However, this Zora is different."
It kills people ruthlessly.
Why did you build such dangerous thing?
It's thrilling.
There wouldn't be any thrill if there weren't a crazy beast.
But this one is too dangerous.
I need your help.
My help?
Please rebuild this Zora to listen to what workers here say at least.
Do you think I'm going to help you?
"Please, Doctor Ochanomizu."
Visitors are also expecting a lot from Zora.
It sure leaves me some profit as well.
This is not right.
You are doing this for the sake of money...
That's right.
I became a scientist to earn money.
A man like you is not suitable for the world of science.
"Doctor Hura, a real elephant is shot dead near the spring."
What?
Is that true?
"There are real animals outside this park, right?"
Then there must be some place where they enter through.
equation.
Do you know what that bunch of points will be?
It's a plane.
"If we have a linear equation, then,"
"fortunately, the graph of the thing, the plot of all the points that"
solve it are a plane.
These three points determine a
"plane, but your lecturer is not Rembrandt and the art is going to be"
the weak point here.
"So I'm just going to draw a plane,"
right?
There's a plane somewhere.
That's my plane.
That plane is all the points that solves this guy.
"Then, what about this one?"
Two x minus y plus zero z.
So z actually can be anything.
"Again, it's going to be another"
plane.
Each row in a three by three problem
gives us a plane in three dimensions.
So this one is going to be some
other plane -- maybe I'll try to draw it like this.
And those two planes meet in a line.
"So if I have two equations,"
"just the first two equations in three dimensions,"
those give me a line.
The line where those two planes
meet.
"And now, the third guy is a third plane."
And it goes somewhere.
"Okay, those three things meet in a point."
100 plus 20 plus 160 is equal to-- what's 50 times 8?
That's 400 plus 30 plus 10F.
What is this?
"2, 50 times 8."
"Right, that's 400."
"OK, this is 120 plus a 160 is 280."
"280 is equal to 430-- this is a good example-- plus 10F, I just realized."
Subtract 430 from both sides.
So what's 430 minus 280?
It's 150.
So it's minus 150 is equal to 10F.
So F is equal to minus 15 Newtons in the counterclockwise direction.
"So F is minus 15 Newtons in the counterclockwise direction, or it means that it is 15 Newtons."
"We assumed that it was in the counterclockwise direction, but when we did the math, we got a minus number."
[SNEEZE]
Excuse me.
I apologize if I blew out your speakers with that sneeze.
"But anyway, we assume it was going in the counterclockwise direction, but when we did the math, we got a negative number, so that means it's actually operating in the clockwise direction at 15 Newtons at a distance of 10 from the moment arm."
"Hopefully, that one was less confusing than the last one."
"So let me do another problem, and these actually used to confuse me when I first learned about moments, but in some ways, they're the most useful ones."
So let's say that I have some type of table.
I'll draw it in wood.
It's a wood table.
That's my table.
"And I have a leg here, I have a leg here."
Let's say that the center of mass of the top of the table is here.
It's at the center.
And let's say that it has a weight.
It has a weight going down.
What's a reasonable weight?
Let's say 20 Newtons.
It has a weight of 20 Newtons.
Is me.
Sing your song at the beep.
"Hi, M.J."
This is Peter.
I was on my way to your show and...
"Well, I was on my bike..."
Are you there?
I really was planning on it all day.
And... ...I know you predicted I'd disappoint you.
Bingo.
"Is amazing, isn't it?"
How complicated a simple thing... ...Iike being someplace at 8:00 can become.
"Actually, there was this obnoxious usher."
"Somebody has to talk to that usher, M.J."
Your time has expired.
Please deposit 50 cents for the next five minutes.
I wanna tell you the truth.
Here it is.
I'm Spider-Man.
"Weird, huh?"
Now you know why I can't be with you.
"If my enemies found out about you... ...if you got hurt, I could never forgive myself."
I wish I could tell you how I feel about you.
Ladies and gentlemen... ...my wife Rosie and I would like to welcome you this afternoon.
"But first, before we start... ...has anybody lost a large roll of 20-dollar bills in a rubber band?"
Because we found the rubber band.
Is a terrible joke.
But thank you for coming.
Today... ...you will witness the birth of a new fusion-based energy source.
"Safe, renewable energy and cheap electricity for everyone."
And now let me introduce my assistants.
These four actuators were developed and programmed... ...for the sole purpose of creating successful fusion.
That's what we've got to do.
"Now, some of you aren't in the optimal position to hit the"
lattice.
I invite you to come down and get a little closer.
That is okay.
"Now, are you roughly ready?"
Yeah.
All right.
But there is one other piece of information that is very important that I have got to tell you.
And that is that only fools aim for their chemistry professor.
[LAUGHTER]
"Okay, go to it."
Watch your ball.
Okay.
Have all the alpha particles been launched?
Yes.
Fantastic.
All right.
Now comes the moment of truth.
How many of you had an alpha particle that backscattered?
"Okay, so now I've got to count."
Keep your hands up because there are some lights that make it a little hard for me to see.
Anybody in this section here?
Yes.
"One, two, three, four, five."
Six.
Anymore?
Did I get everybody?
That's it?
Six alpha particles that backscattered.
"Okay, so now we have to calculate some probabilities here."
The probability of backscattering is the number that backscattered.
This number line counts by tens.
We have two hundreds; there's the number two hundred.
"Five tens, hmmm... there's different ways we can do that."
Let's just count by tens.
"Ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty."
"Five tens and three ones; not three jumps, but three small ones."
"One, two, three, and we're at two hundred fifty three."
Let's try two hundred fifty three again because there are a number of ways we can do this.
"Again, our number line is counting by tens."
"We're going to start at two hundred, but this time instead of five tens,  let's do one jump of fifty."
"So, we're at two hundred fifty."
"We need three ones, one, two, three, and we're at two hundred fifty three."
"In this lesson you have learned  how to show numbers on a number line by thinking about hundreds, tens, and ones."

My Damn Channel Live.
"It's me, Beth Hoyt."
It's a big Wednesday show.
"We have not one, but two special guests for you today."
"We've got Julie Klausner, author of the book, ""I Don't"
"Care About Your Band,"" and host of ""The Hit"", and one of my favorite podcasts, ""How Was Your Week?"""
"And if you've listened to ""How Was Your Week?"" Then you've heard the theme song by funny man and indie punk rock legend"
"Ted Leo, who's also here."
"We're going to be playing lots of games, including another round of Fuck, Marry, Kill."
You know how it goes.
"Three names, you know."
Give us some suggestions for that in the chat.
We'll use them.
"First, though, I want to talk about chairs."
On my wife's advice.
Look.
My first premium was for 1501 rupees..
There's a well-known temple in the South.
I paid it there.
"Then, I've been paying 1000 rupees every year.. ..at Lord Ganesha's stall."
It's called a mandap.
"And, your honour, my mother-in-law used to be very sick."
"So, the temple authorities said, "" Pay us 11,000.. """
""" ..perform a veneration and watch the miracle "" ."
We performed the veneration and my mother-in-law passed away.
"That was a good thing, but I also lost 11,000."
And they didn't refund a single rupee.
"And then, donation at the mosque.. ..blanket at the shrine, candle at church, alms for beggar.. ..incense sticks, veil for Mother Goddess."
ln total I've paid around 10 lakhs in all these stores.
Enough!
Enough!
Don't call it a store.
It's called a temple.
And people donate willingly at the temple.. ..for the peace and prosperity of their family.
Even I gave this amount.. ..for the peace and prosperity of my family.
And not for fun.
But your God snatched all the peace from my life.
Because only God can cause earthquakes.
Humans cannot do it.
"So tell me, don't I've a right to ask God for compensation?"
Mr. Kanji.
"You've a tiff with God, don't you?"
- Yes.
So why don't you ask Him directly for compensation?
Why are you asking the temples?

No.
I'm not a totally square.
"Alright, last year when you wanted the magenta stripe in your bangs"
We've got this stripe.
"Yeah, and I hated this stripe because it turned on me."
I thought it was so daring and cool.

"No tatoos, Sam"
"No bikers named Satan showing up here asking for date, no Sam."
No

Yeah

"Dear Diary, How many calories are in grape*?"
I gained 1.7 pounds this weekend.
"It was a box of rasin nuts, that Josh brought on Friday that did it."
I know it.
"He just stopped* holding my hand halfway through the movie and I crashed into into this total panic thinking he's disgustedby me, he's dumping me"
This is so stupid.
What happened?
What did they say? &amp;gt; Why? &amp;gt; Tell us Yaman!
Later.
"Come on,Mert!"
"What's happening?- I have something to do, I will solve it and be back."
Come on man!
You will take the exam.- I will come until then
"What can be more important than exam? &amp;gt; Yaman!- I will come, don't worry!"
Your exam is at 3 o'clock you have to be her at 2:30.
Can it be that the interview was bad?
Wait for me..
Subtitles brought to you by Ebb and Tide Team @ Viki
"Hello, can I come in?"
"Please Mr. Selim, you're welcome.- I won't take your time..."
I wanted to ask how was the interview?
Take a sit.
Don't say it wasn't brilliant.
"Actually as you said, Yaman is a very intelligent boy."
He shows this with the grades from the previous exams but...
"But... -I don't like these ""but-s"" at all ...by God,"
Really..- I don't think he is suitable for this school.
He is a tensed boy and I found him emotional too. which one of us wasn't like that in that age?
"Yaman is very intelligent, very wise and... hardworking..."
"A determined boy,"
I believe that if he has an opportunity he will be very successful .
Be sure..&amp;gt; You did what you could about him Selim.
After this he will find the opportunity for himself on his own.
According to the grade he will get in the last exam otherwise...
I don't even want to think about a contrary possibility!
Have an easy work!
"Master, I need 1000 TL urgently!"
1000 TL??- As an advance payment. you will cut it from my weekly salary.
"Okay, I'll sort of start it the"
"same way, say maybe 2x-y and maybe I'll take"
no zs as a zero and maybe a -x+2y and maybe a -z as a --
"oh, let me make that a minus one and, just for variety let me take,"
"-3z, -3ys, I should keep the ys in that line, and 4zs is, say, 4."
Okay.
That's three equations.
"I'm in three dimensions, x, y,"
z.
"And, I don't have a solution yet."
So I want to understand the
equations and then solve them.
Okay.
So how do I you understand
them?
The row picture one way.
The column picture is another very
important way.
"Just let's remember the matrix form,"
"here, because that's easy."
The matrix form -- what's our matrix A?
"Our matrix A is this right-hand side, the two and the minus one and"
"the zero from the first row, the minus one and the two and the"
"minus one from the second row, the zero, the minus three and the"
four from the third row.
So it's a three by three matrix.
"Three equations, three unknowns."
And what's our right-hand side?
"Of course, it's the vector, zero minus one, four."
Okay.
"So that's the way, well, that's the short-hand to write"
out the three equations.
"Now the kids get all excited and say ""Alright, I am going vegan!"""
And just God knows what they are telling the parents.

This is not healthy.
I do not know if kids hear that.

"On a healthier note you have your scrambled eggs, I have my scrambled tofu."
Pancakes.
"You don't have to use cow's milk, use soy milk, oat milk , rice milk, almond milk, coconut milk, hemp milk."
Fruits and vegetables.
Spaghetti.
Pasta.
Refried beans.
"Even have vegan sour cream,"
"Guacamole, comes from the avocado."
Soy cheese.
Rice cheese.
They even have this magical cheese I'll get to in a sec.
Veggie burger.
Veggie dog.
"Cupcakes, they have egg replacer."
I think I got them here.
"So you can replace the eggs with bananas, applesauce even."
"You can use soy milk, oat milk, more flour, water."
Coconut milk ice cream.
One of the best ice creams in the world.
"Again, it's not healthy, but healthier than cow milk ice cream."
"I've always said to people, ""Wait a minute, if you can put a man or a woman on the moon, how hard is it to make a cheese that doesn't come from a cow, or a goat?"
"How is it hard to make a vegan cheese?"""
"Well, they heard me."
"This is called a Daiya cheese actually, and it's great thing."
"- I went to meet him, he didn't show."
"I called his office, I called his house."
Okay.
"Go to the hospital, ask around."
Somebody's gotta know where he is.
What the hell happened?
Tell Father Moore I'm sorry.
Tell him I know the demons are real and I admire his courage... ...for standing and speaking against them.
Tell him I know what they can do.
- Cartwright's dead.
- I heard.
Are you drunk?
"- Not yet, but I'm working on it."
- Have you seen this?
- What the hell were you thinking?
- Karl...
You told me you'd talk him out of testifying.
"Instead, you put on a freak show with taped demons... ...and a dead girl speaking in tongues... ...and your client testifies that the archbishop sanctioned the exorcism."
We'll be lucky if the archdiocese isn't named...
I had a doctor who was gonna corroborate.
"Besides that, Father Moore's testimony's crucial to his defense."
Did you forget the archdiocese is paying for this defense?
The archdiocese isn't on trial.
I swore an oath to do what's best for my client.
"Spare me the law school pieties, Bruner."
You cashed in your conscience at the door.
- People can change.
- Like James Van Hopper?
It's not over.
I can put Mr. Rose on the stand... ...to corroborate Father Moore about the exorcism.
And there are the girls.
"Her sister Alice, she saw part of it."
That's the least significant stage.
"What we make sure is that all these animals have been ""grass only"" for at least a year because we do buy some calves from places we're not sure how they're handled."
A lot of these are getting ready to go to slaughter.
"Yeah, twelve of them will go tomorrow."
And how old are those that are going?
They are probably 28 months.
They don't grow as fast as they would on grain.
On grain they would grow faster.
"But they don't require any tillage, and this whole thing works on real time solar energy."
You're seeing it here.
"There's no fertilizer, no tillage, no annuals."
And you're creating topsoil.
That's exactly right.
America needs more topsoil.
"Yes, you're exactly right,"
America needs more topsoil.
That's for sure.

I will go do some work.
If I'm late... ...give this paper to anyone will bring you to me.
You will be late?
"No, no."
Just if I am late.
"Goodbye, Mother."
"What's your name, sweetheart?"
Abdallah.
Abdallah.
"What a nice name, Abdallah."
"Take this, sweetheart."
Candy.
"It's okay, take it."
"This is for you, sweetheart."
You know what I'm saying?
We're going by the lyrics.
"Although you may want to wrench your fingers from embarrassment, you have to."
"Now we'll be filming the scene of where I reminiscence about a ""Coffee Shop"""
I say this a lot but acting is very difficult and it doesn't match well with me...
I think that's what it is.
But today's weather is great.
"Wait, no it's not."
I didn't realize because of my sunglasses.
Anyway I have to film the scene where I'm reminiscing about an ex-girlfriend.
But people are staring so I'm embarrassed.
"Still, I gotta try my best."
"Today is the day before the last day of filming for ""Coffee Shop""."
Tomorrow is the last day and today is the day before that.
Many passerby's are taking photos of us.
It feels strange and interesting.
I like it.
I like it a lot.
There isn't much time until we go back.
Tomorrow is the last day of shooting and we leave the day after that.
I want to enjoy NY more while I'm here.
There hasn't been enough time to look around.
What do you want to do?
Me?
Just walking around here a little bit would be fantastic.
"You have a lot of time, walk around."
I'm done filming.
I feel down.
I'm wearing my own gear today
These are the most recent pair I purchased.
I got to dance in a battle with great dancers.
Rainy New York morning.
"Shalu, give me a kiss, please!"
No ki. .ss.
"All this has to be done after marriage, not before marriage."
"Neelambar, neither are you married, nor I.Then what are you talking about?"
You openly express love in the garden.
Don't you feel ashamed?
Why should I feel ashamed?
- Why are you quiet?
Answer me.
Why don't you speak?
- I'm speaking so loudly. . . and you say I'm not speaking?
You have fallen in love.
- Wish what you are saying was true.
"But no, I have not fallen in love."
"Pitambar, he is not telling you, but me and Shalu."
"Oh, so you were talking to these two and I was interrupting . . . and adding to the confusion?"
But what were they doing?
"We have never done it, so how do we know? and reached the garden so soon."
- And will reach marriage stage soon.
"But remember, no kiss, no risk."
"Sir, the information is confirmed."
The diamond dealing will be done in Hotel Blue Diamond's swimming pool.
"Sir, the diamonds are worth 100 million rupees."
Which police officer has been given the responsibility of such a big case?
"Sir, a very capable officer, Inspector Gorpade."
Gorpade?
The one who could not attend the meeting of his own case. . . how will he nab the culprits?
"Sir, agreed that you and Gorpade don't share a good relationship."
That doesn't mean you don't consider him capable of any job.
Even he has solved many big cases.
Is it?
"Gentlemen, what time was this meeting scheduled?"
I was trying to find something that didn't look quite so horrible.
Just a second here.
"Here, we'll just do this."
- Not much better.
"- OK, OK."
Everybody is a fricking art critic.
"- If you wanted ugly discussions, this is the slide for you."
- Hold that.
I can't do this.
"Oh, oh no."
This is like way more than my French can handle.
You can deal with the blue.
I'm sorry.
I can read cereal boxes and soup cans but....
I decided it will be a fiery topic.
It makes spaghetti bindings.
"- I use it a lot, but it still can make spaghetti bindings."
"- We validate that, by the way, now."
"- [indecipherable] ""bindings are spaghetti [indecipherable] ""?"
- We validate.
"Even the bindings part, oddball expression."
"At least, it might be spaghetti, but we'll tell you if you have a bogus binding in the middle."
"Personally, I like WOOgnl, we use it all the time."
But I've talked to some people who thought it was harmful.
- I feel bad every time I use it.
"But yeah, we use it, definitely."
"- Just wash your hands afterwards, and everything will be fine."
Right?
I think that's it.
"Thank you, everybody."
The Hungarian Association for Free Birth Choices presents:
Csaba Madarász
What okay?
"It's not , far from it."
What's all this hurry to achieve your interests from every opportunity?
What does that mean madam?
We didn't do anything yet.- Sequestration officers are here.
How do you know?&amp;gt; I know.
What's happening Selim?
Can something like this happen?
You brought the officers to our door without notifying us.
"Just a minute, I am the representative of the claimant, Mr. Umit didn't demand me for something like this."
"The claimer is Safet Orhun, not Mr. Umit."
"Mert, you go, I will come after."
Can I take a look to the documents?
:
"I am saying there is a mistake in this issue, why don't you listen?"
Is there any news from your brother?
"Don't worry,"
This issue will be solved today.
It's not my trouble.
If there is no money there won't be a sick certificate either.
Then you will be moved to prison way.
OK...
I said I would find it.
It will come today.
We will see.
Did he enter inside?-Yes he did.
Why did you choose this school?
Because I want to have a good education.
"Can you define ""Good"" to us?"
"How, in the lexical meaning? &amp;gt; No, no..."
"What do you mean when you say ""Good education"", I am curious about that."
Good.... promising in every way.
It depends what this bx term does.
"But if we look at the choices, the only choice that intercepts the y-axis below the x-axis at a negative y-intercept and opens down is choice A."
"There's only three choices that open down, and only choice A intercepts in the negative area, so the answer is A."
"It actually looks eerily like what I drew, just out of the blue."
Next question.
Problem number 12.
"OK, so they drew a square."
"And I will draw a square, because they drew a square."
"And they say this is A, this is B, this is C, D."
And this is P.
This is Q.
And out here is R.
"I don't know where this problem's going, but it looks interesting."
"Figure not drawn to scale, of course."
"In the figure above, ABCD is a rectangle, with"
BC is equal to 4.
AB is equal to 6.
"P, Q, and R are different points on a line, not shown, that is parallel to AD."
"So P, Q, and R are apparently all on the same line that is parallel to AD."
"Well, I guess that is the way they drew it."
So let me erase.
Let's just say this is Q.
That R is down here.
This isn't R.
So they're all on the same line.
"And they say the line isn't shown, but it's parallel to AD."
So let me draw that line.
So that line looks something like this.
Let me draw it straight.
"And on that line, you have P, Q, and R, and it is parallel to AD."
Good enough.
Points P and Q are symmetric about line AB.
Would you like something to drink?
No thanks.
And the reason you wanted to see me...?
We found something while investigating this accident.
I thought I'd better show you.
And these were found in Mr. Lee Jin-woo's clothes.
Soo-jeong.
Me too.
I love you too.
Sad Movie
They say that I'm an optical illusion.
They say that I'm just a social construct.
They say that I'm a racist because I'm white.
They say that I'm a racist because I'm white.
The same people who say that it's fine for black and brown people to organize themselves for their own benefit say it's evil if my people do the same.
Why?
Who makes these unfair rules?
Asia is Asian.
Africa is African.
Where are the white countries?
They say that white countries don't exist.
They tell me to be loyal to humans but they all step on me.
People are saving endangered species like the whales and the spotted owl
What about my sub-species?
Would you call me a Nazi if want a happy future for people like myself?
Does Israel need diversity?
Whites are 8 percent of the world population and decreasing.
If they are against racism why don't they fight for me?
Why don't they fight for me?
What about a future for me?
What about a future for me?
What about a future for me?
They lived in that
little house around the corner.
There was one brother that would be here - one or two that would be here
like all summer.
Coordinate stuff.
"Do you recall their names, or?"
Not really.
But they'd play ball
Baseball?
Yep.
And they'd go for walks after supper every night.
Walking down the middle of the road.
With their habits on.
"And then Larry McDonough was just getting into the riding stable thing and they'd - he had 6, 8 horses."
That was one of the things they'd do.
They could rent the horses.
They had one day to be back and forth on them.
And they just seemed a real pleasant bunch.
They never preached.
They didn't do anything like that.
"They were just more friendly, you know."
They were all teachers out of Chicago.
Some Jesuit college or something down there.
"Not Jesuit, but you know."
But we'd always haul them - pick up their luggage with the truck and - same as like when boy scouts come.
You'd load all their gear in the truck and take it up to Fox Lake or into that little road into
Barney's Lake.
"It's fenced off now, but down there."
"So, the brothers would come here."
They were teaching at the colleges down in Chicago there.
Their time here was for what?
That was their retreat.
I have 1kg of sugar?
I'm going to use 100g of vanilla.
The ideal is using refined sugar or caster sugar.
Moustache:
"And what about the ""brownd"" sugar, can't it?"
"You can, actually you can use any sugar."
But we use more...
"The brown sugar has more flavour, right?"
So it'll mask the vanilla's flavour.
It's easier a sugar that doesn't have much flavour.
"It's better with the refined or with the caster sugar, because they are more thin."
"The caster sugar isn't the Icing sugar ok, guys?"
The Icing sugar has starch.
"It's not this, ok?"
"So, or the caster sugar or the refined sugar."
"But I don't have any of them here, so I'm using granulated sugar."
"I've never seen, really, anywhere, this unique support for cancer research."
"And so I want to thank you for your participation, your collaboration and most of all, for your confidence in our ideas."
(Applause)
Lookie here.
Now I'm f&amp;amp; excited if I've left something more than just ... the usual rations.
See if there is anything else that could be eaten.
Just think if I left some candy.
That would be great.
IS THERE ANY CANDY HERE?
"I don't think there is any, but one can always hope."
"Matches, even more Vaseline I don't really have use for."
Zinc ointment.
"Very much in here, apparently good."
YEAH!
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
YEAAAAAAAAAAAA -
It has different legendary levels.
"It is very good, you teach me..."
"OK, I showed my dad a new game and..."
Yes...
You have completed your things!
I made my registration to the reeve here.At this house.
It was necessary like that for school.
Did you talk with the prison management?
When can I see my brother?
"I was busy with Faruk Beylice's lawsuit , so I couldn't take care of that but I will solve it."
I promise!
Is there any development about that issue at least?
"No, unfortunately, it looks very hard..."
What's that Suzan?
Have you ever seen us eating dessert after dinner...
Yaman bought it with his first weekly salary.
Oh...
My dear...
The master gave us our weekly salary and I bought it to thank you..
You bought us dessert...
This dessert will take away the whole sadness and tiredness we had all day.
Exactly..
May God give you abundance.
- Enjoy it!
"Oh, my brother..."
"Good that I bought half a kilo, if I bought one kilo we would have floods here."
Are you comfortable my sweeetie?&amp;gt; yes.
"Don't worry for anything, okay?"
Don't be sad for anything!
Everything will get better.
We will sleep and wake up and everything will be better.
"Don't treat me like a baby, it's okay."
You don't even see -
"After suppertime would hit, Jule would put out a set of sawhorses up by the church and up by the museum and the road gets in the winter - packed down."
We'd slide down hill until 10 o'clock at night.
"Kids don't even know what a sleigh looks like, you know."
Sliding down like where the...
"Actually, there was a tennis court where the church is."
But you'd be sliding down like where the rectory is and where the medical center.
"Hell, you're kids, and that was a big hill then."
And we'd go up to where the tower is.
But that's when you're older.
Go down there in a homemade toboggan and kill yourself.
What was Old Patrick Bonner like?
"Nice, pleasant fellow."
A little brogue.
He had one eye.
Accent and everything.
A lot of the guys did.
I don't know what's going on over there.
The seagulls are swarming all over.
Must be some [?] coming in or something.
"But, yeah, he was nice."
"Regular, pleasant guy."
Had the farm up there.
Otherwise...
Was he the only fiddler at that time?
Yeah.
Guy ...
King Strang might have done a little fiddling.
I can't think of...
He pretty much - and Jule played the guitar and he played the steel to the ... he played that really good...
"And Walter McCauley, he was just out of school."
Maybe sailing a little bit.
"Because in this case, n could be-- could this would be n and this is would be n plus 1-- so n is either equal to 2 or n is equal to minus 3."
That's a little tricky.
The intuition is to just assume that n is positive but it doesn't have to be positive.
So n could be 2 or minus 3 here.
That's a tricky one.
So that one by itself does not help us solve the problem.
"The second part of it, point two it says, 2 to the 2n is equal to 16."
"And whenever you have these in the SAT or the GMAT or anything whenever you have a variable in the exponent, your goal really is to just get everything in the same base."
So we could write the left-hand side the same.
So that's 2 to the 2n.
And how do we write 16 with the base 2?
"Well, 16 is just 2 to the fourth, right?"
And so we get 2n is equal to 4. n is equal to 2.
So this statement alone is enough to figure it out.
This statement alone is not.
So the answer is B.
Statement two alone is sufficient.
40 is B.
"And this was tricky because one, you think that 1n alone is sufficient but it is ambiguous because and n could be minus 3."
41.
41.
OK.
"They've drawn a bunch of, if I see this right,"
They draw a bunch of-- two lines.
Let's see if I can draw this.
So a line and then there's a bunch of circles.
"One circle, two circles they have, and then they keep going."
"Three circles, and then one more."
It's going to be right there.
Four circles.
I think that's about right.
And they say essentially that the circles just keep going on and on.
I'm tired here
I am tired a lot ..
I'm done
I'm So tired
Look they're laughing..
I'll smash them under my feet
What is happening?
Stop it ..
I'm tired ..
I am a human
I'm tired ..
I am pregnant get up .. they won't shup up aunt Kadriye
I'm pregnant please... again .. again.. again ok .. we'll ask them to be back
We want them ..
We want them
How were we? great sister congratulation you girls
"Many of them fainted from admiration yeah because they were drunk, they loved you get out from here .. why are you so jealous? jealous of what? you were wonderful ladies"
We tried our best
"And you, you have to rip that contract .."
Agreed?
We have paid our debt .. we're not in debt anymore well what if you don't leave now what if you go out again on stage
No I am not moving from here
Look ..
Customers are upset.. they started breaking dishes
I do not care .. it is not my dishes
There has been a misunderstanding madame but.. please grant my request and go up on stage again
Please
Ok..
We will go out again
But we have some conditions
"Of course, madame, anything you want"
"Gülnaz, What are these conditions?"
"They are a little cold but, I thought it will serve."
"Oh, thank you..."
"Okay then, tomorrow in your last exam,no?"
"I have the interview and exam too, they come in package."
"Interviews are very important, you know."
You have to show them you have sufficiently capacity to study in that school.
"I would say something for their capacities but...anyways..,"
From tomorrow you will be a university student.
With God's willing!
What?- I will say something... but don't get angry right away.. don't say:
"""Don't interfere"", okay?"
"Call your mom too, talk to her."
Tell her that your exam is tomorrow.
Let her be happy too.
"Okay, i'll call her."
Of course I won't call her.
"Mira we'll talk properly about this in a suitable time but let's not talk about it at the last night before my exam,OK?"
Good!
I am sorry.
Good luck !&amp;gt; Thank you.
Success!
I will ask something...You will be angry with me too...
Ask..
"Last night, why did that blighter make you cry?- Are you spying on us?"
He alarmed the whole street with the voice of his burned plastic.( applying breaks on tires)
Do... you really love that man?
Good night.
Kenan calling...
What's up Dwarf ? &amp;gt; Brother!
- It means you remembered you have a brother.
"Brother, where are you calling from?"
"Don't make a show man, as if you don't know I am at the hospital."
Like zero.
"And of course, we're probably 16 years old"
"I mean, what the hell."
"We all skate, and we weren't experts, but we started skating."
"Now, you don't see a kid out there."
"Sunday afternoon, and nobody knows how to skate."
"But anyway, they're all watching that damn TV, or..."
We got out there and finally one of us had enough brains.
I don't know who.
I ain't gonna take the credit because we looked around and here the island was just a little bit of a smudge like this.
And the mainland
looks like from here to Garden Island.
"So one of us had enough brains to say, Maybe we better..."
"We had good, sharp skates"
Not a drop of snow or nothing.
Just like skating on a groomed rink except for the pressure through the cracks.
One of us finally had enough brains to turn around and come back.
"Now, you were 16 when you - ?"
"Probably was, yeah."
So you've kept pretty close and expect to see all nine of them?
"Well, eight of them."
Kenny died in Texas.
The guy that was in the Navy.
He died from cancer in Texas here a couple years ago.
Good friend.
"That was probably the whole graduating class, then?"
"Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
"In fact, freshman year I was the only boy."
Gary was in seminary and Kenny was a grade ahead of us.
I was the only boy.
What other exploits did you have together with that group?
And they're both going to be negative because their sum is negative.
And there's something interesting here.
49 is a perfect square.
"Its factors are 1, 7, and 49."
"So maybe 7 will work, or even better, maybe negative 7 will work."
And it does!
Negative 7 times negative 7 is 49.
And negative 7 plus negative 7 is negative 14.
"We have that pattern there, where we have 2 times a number, and then we have the number squared."
This is a perfect square.
"This is equal to x minus 7, times x minus 7, is equal to 0."
Don't want to forget that.
Or we could write this as x minus 7 squared is equal to 0.
So this was a perfect square of a binomial.
"And if x minus 7 squared is equal to 0, take the square root of both sides."
You'll get x minus 7 is equal to 0.
"I mean, you could say x minus 7 is 0 or x minus 7 is 0."
But that'd be redundant.
So we just get x minus 7 is 0.
"Add 7 to both sides, and you get x is equal to 7."
Only one solution there.
Let's do another one in pink.
Let's say we have x squared minus 64 is equal to 0.
Now this looks interesting right here.
A bell might be ringing in your head on how to solve this.
"This has no x term, but we could think of it as having an x term."
We could rewrite this as x squared plus 0x minus 64.
"So in this situation, we could say, OK, what two numbers, when I multiply them, equal 64, and when I add them equal 0?"
"And when I take their product, I'm getting a negative number, right?"
This is a times b.
It's a negative number.
So that must mean that they have opposite signs.
"When I take their sum, I get positive 4."
So I can rewrite this equation here.
"I could rewrite it as x plus 7, times x minus 3, is equal to 0."
"And now I can solve this by saying, look, I have two quantities."
Their product is equal to 0.
That means that one or both of them have to be equal to 0.
So that means that x plus 7 is equal to 0.
That's an x.
Or x minus 3 is equal to 0.
I could subtract 7 from both sides of this equation.
And I would get x is equal to negative 7.
"And over here, I can add 3 to both sides of this equation."
And I'll get x is equal to 3.
So both of these numbers are solutions to this equation.
You could try it out.
If you do 7-- negative 7 squared is 49.
"Negative 7 times 4 is minus 28, or negative 28."
And that does indeed equal 21.
And I'll let you try it out with the positive 3.
"Actually, let's just do it."
"3 squared is 9, plus 4 times 3 is 12."
"9 plus 12 is, indeed, 21."
Let's do a bunch more examples.
Let's say I have x squared plus 49 is equal to 14x.
"Once again, whenever you see anything like this, get all of your terms on one side of the equation and get a 0 on the other side."
That's the best way to solve a quadratic equation.
So let's subtract 14x from both sides.
We could write this as x squared minus 14x plus 49 is equal to 0.
"Obviously, 14x minus 14x is 0."
This quantity minus 14x is this quantity right there.
"Now we just have to think about what two numbers, when I take their product, I'm going to get 49, and when I take their sum, I'm going to get negative 14."
"So one, they have to be the same sign because this is a positive number right here."
"Just think: all the cars, tractors, trucks, ships and planes in the world added together emit fewer greenhouse gasses than livestock farming!"
Oh really?
"Wow, I thought it was mostly cars."
Wow!
Wow!
Wow!
Livestock?
"That's crazy, so more than the cars."
Are you serious?
"Yeah, I didn't know that."
That's insane.
"No, I did not know that, no."
That's news to me.
I haven't heard that.
"I've never heard the livestock connection, no."
"Well I knew there was some, but I had no idea that it was so extensive."
How does it come from livestock exactly?
What do you call cow farts?
What do you call that?
OK ...
"Yeah, the methane gas coming from the cows."
Yeah.
"It's cow shit, right?"
Doesn't cow poop?
"It's what the emissions, right?"
"I thought it was just fat people here in the South, here in America."
"But no, apparently it's cattle as well."
It's quite worrying.
"Well I saw an article and they say, because it is the cow, what they fart and then actually the farting they make the global warming."
And how can it be that farm animals place a heavier burden on the environment than the entire transport sector worldwide?
"Well, actually it is rather simple."
Once upon a time a farmer was someone who owned land and some animals.
"Here it is, here's the two seconds."
-Balls to you!
"-Yeah, that's it."
Ballz to you!
"Yeah, now that clip's been floating around, it was posted like three days ago and suddenly it's everybody's catchphrase."
-Balls to you!
-Now I don't know why she said it.
I don't know the context.
"I can't imagine what the interviewer could've asked her to get her to say,"
-Balls to you!
-But everyone told me the rest of the interview went normal and that...
-Balls to you!
"-Was just one soundbite and she wasn't yelling, ""Balls to you"" to everyone."
"I mean, I would've yelled it to everyone, but she didn't."
But I'm on board.
Balls to you is hilarious.
"It's probably the best video that you've ever watched, you just don't realize it yet."
"Don't worry, you'll get it in like a week."
"You'll wake up in the middle of the night like,"
"""Oh, balls to me."""
And I sincerely hope that one of those YouTube guys makes a Balls To You remix.
"-Balls to you, b-balls to you"
"-Yeah, or something like that."
"Come on, balls to you doesn't have to be insulting."
It could be a term of endearment.
"Balls to you guy, sir."
[chuckles]
"Balls to you, sir."
Now I remember you guys sent me this video like a year ago and I thought it was funny but I didn't get time to review it.
"But now suddenly the video's blown up, which suggests that it aired on TV somewhere."
Now the concept of the video is simple.
"A couple of stoners roll up to Taco Bell and order their food, but you know, as Elmo."
"Whether the Lord exists or not, doesn't make a difference to me."
The insurance people said that.. ..God has razed down my shop.
"Or, he's the One behind your shop's destruction."
"So, I said fine."
Ask God to compensate for my losses.
Case closed.
But why will God raze down your shop?
Fool!
Please.
Please come to the witness box and speak.
May Lord forgive his naiveness.
May Lord forgive his naiveness.
May Lord forgive his naiveness.
Why will God raze down my shop?
"Exactly, why will God raze down my shop?"
He has other important things to do.
"So, tell the insurance company to pay me."
End of matter.
Why will the insurance company pay you?
You've agreed to the terms and conditions.. ..of the insurance company.
"Exhibit no.1, sir."
Right.
Then God will have to compensate for it.
"Call upon, Lord Ram, Shiva, Ganpati.. ..Whoever you get along better with."
"Do some of your hocus-pocus, or.. - Fool!"
The only way to find God is through salvation.
God won't descend down on earth.. ..for a ordinary man like you.
He would only if He exists.
"You're turnover is in millions, and this is a small settlement."
Just say yes.
I will even give you cash discount.
Really.
Right away!
You will talk with the foreman and will get the permission.
Thank you.
Is there any news from uncle Faruk?
What will happen if they find him?
Will he go to jail?
"He has to pay his debt, of course first he has to appear."
Give it! ~ Faruk calling.
"Yes, Faruk."
-Hi -I guess you need me more than you need her?
"Thanks, ..Thank you very much."
"How bad is the situation ,Faruk?"
"Very bad, very."
I am totally in a mess.
We guess so.
"Of course you're Umit's lawyer, you must know it."
But now I am here as a neighbor.
As much as I knew you were a hardworking man who loved his work.
We knew that everything was going well.
What happened that you came in this state?
"I made an investment in Japan,"
"I was in reserve incomes and a little risky but... ... the business was a flop, and the money lost."
Exactly.
"For a time being I managed by taking in cash from the account .. but after the rumors, everyone started to withdraw their money at the same time."
I was disintegrated.
How do you think to pay your debt?
Actually not everything is over...
There are also other investments I am waiting for the return.
"Those are solid, but I need at least 3 month till the money is back.. can't postpone the debts anymore."
"My problem is time, I don't have any other worry."
"Let's consider that you postponed your debts, how much can you pay?"
Everything.
"produces a zero, and in the second component I have a"
"minus one and a four, they combine to give the three."
But look at this picture.
So here's our key picture.
I combine this column and this column to get this guy.
That was the b.
That's the zero three.
Okay.
So that idea of
"linear combination is crucial, and also -- do we want to think"
about this question?
"Sure, why not."
What are all the combinations?
If I took -- can I go back to xs and ys?
This is a question for
"really -- it's going to come up over and over, but why don't we see it"
once now?
"If I took all the xs and all the ys, all the combinations,"
what would be all the results?
"And, actually,"
the result would be that I could get any right-hand side at all.
The combinations of this and this would fill the whole plane.
You can tuck that away.
"We'll, explore it further."
But this idea
of what linear combination gives b and what do all the linear
"combinations give, what are all the possible,"
achievable right-hand sides be -- that's going to be basic.
Okay.
Can I move to three equations and three unknowns?
Because it's easy to picture the two by two case.
Let me do a three by three example.
Radha likes him.
If we are getting a good son-in-law... ...what's wrong in waiting for few more years?
"By then, even Radha will pass her graduation."
And it's not easy to get her married in this circumstances.
Radha!
Come out.
Come here.
You always shared everything with me.
But today you didn't tell me about your feelings?
Father!
Kishan!
I can't come and see you in the jail.
And this letter also may be my last letter to you.
On this condition brother Damu has postponed... ...my marriage for 2 more years.
"Kishan, how will I spend these two years?"
I'll miss you every moment.
"We'll meet, Kishan."
We'll definitely meet... ...at the same place from where we had separated.
"""Even after separation, we're worried about one thing."""
"""How will I live for years in this condition?"""
"""Death didn't but your memories reached me."""
"""Long period of separation."""
"""After few days love we faced a long period of separation."""
"""Long period of separation."""
"""My lips murmured in prayer for you."""
"""Long period of separation."""
"""After few days love we faced a long period of separation."""
"""Long period of separation."""
"""I'm not with you, my love."""
"""And there's no hope of our meeting."""
"""And there's no hope of our meeting."""
"""On top of it, the spring puts us on test."""
You have to do 3 minus i over 3 minus i.
"I'm doing that because when you multiply a complex number by its conjugate, you end up actually with a real number."
Then you're going to end up with a complex number up here.
"A conjugate, all it means is you keep the real part the same, and you change the sign on the imaginary part."
That's all that word means.
"All right, now let's figure out what this is equal to."
"2 times 3, just same distributive properties as always."
Let me do it in green.
2 times 3 is 6.
"2 times minus i is minus 2i, all of that over 3 times 3 is 9."
3 times minus i is minus 3i. i times 3 is plus 3i.
"Then i times minus i, you can view that as minus i squared."
Let's think about what this is equal to.
"Well, this plus 3i and the minus 3i cancel out."
What's i squared?
"Well, this is equal to negative 1."
So you end up with a minus of a negative 1.
Minus a negative 1 is a plus 1.
So you're left with 6 minus 2i over 9 plus 1 over 10.
"Actually, we can reduce this some."
We can divide the top and the bottom by 2.
So that becomes 3 minus i over 5.
We just divided both the numerator and the denominator by 2.
That is choice B.
"Problem 29, these go fast."
No systems of equations and all that.
What is the product of the complex numbers 3 plus i and 3 minus i?
They just asked us that.
That was in the last problem.
"When we multiplied 3 plus i times 3 minus i, what did we get?"
We got 10.
We did this whole thing.
it is one of the first column and two of the second column and let's
just see what we get.
So in the first component I'm
getting a two and a ten.
I'm getting a twelve there.
"In the second component I'm getting a one and a six, I'm"
getting a seven.
So that matrix times that vector is
twelve seven.
"Now, you could do that another way."
You could do it a row at a time.
And you would get this twelve --
and actually I pretty much did it here -- this way.
Two -- I could take that row times my vector.
This is the idea of a
dot product.
"This vector times this vector, two times one plus five"
times two is the twelve.
This vector times this vector --
one times one plus three times two is the seven.
"So I can do it by rows, and in each row times my x is what"
I'll later call a dot product.
But I also like to see it by
columns.
I see this as a linear combination of a column.
So here's my point.
A times x is a combination of the
columns of A. That's how I hope you will think of A times x when we need
it.
"Right now we've got -- with small ones, we can always do it"
"in different ways, but later, think of it that way."
Okay.
Thank God.
"It would have been sad if I wasted two videos and ended up with a careless, negative number."
Anyway.
"So now we have s squared plus a squared, over s squared, times y is equal to this."
Multiply both sides times s squared over-- s squared plus a squared.
"Divide both sides by this, and we get y is equal to 1 over s squared-- And actually, let me make sure that that is right."
"It's 1 over s squared. y is equal to 1 over s squared, times s squared, over s squared plus a squared."
And then these cancel out.
And let me make sure that I haven't made another careless mistake.
Because I have a feeling I have.
Yep.
There.
I see the careless mistake.
And it was all in this term.
"And I hope you don't mind my careless mistakes, but I want you to see that I'm doing these things in real time and"
"I am human, in case you haven't realized already."
"Anyway, so I made the same careless mistake."
"So I factor out an e to the minus st here, so it's plus."
But it was a over s squared.
So this is an a.
That's an a.
And so this is an a.
And so this is an a.
And so this is an a.
Right?
This was an a.
And this is the correct answer. a over s squared plus a squared.
So I hope those careless mistakes didn't throw you off too much.
These things happen when you do integration by parts twice with a bunch of variables.
"But anyway, now we are ready to add a significant entry into our table of Laplace transforms."
"And that is that the Laplace transform-- I had an extra curl, there."
That was unecessary.
"When they got back to [?] and found out about three days later, the nun gets a letter from the - the nun that was the principal there and she'd never want to see us here at Beaver"
Island again.
"All we did was, they had Lloyd's cabin out there"
A bunch of the cabins like that.
And the chaperones are in one and the kids are in one.
So Gary and I and a couple of - we just showed up and we went and had refreshments for them until about 5 in the morning.
"Poor kids get on the boat, and Dad was on the boat going over to Charlevoix at the time."
He was the manager.
I had to go over for some reason or other.
I forget what the reason was.
It was rougher than hell.
So I just called the airplane.
I flew.
I wasn't gonna take the boat.
So I get over there and get cleaned up and everything.
I hadn't had enough sleep either.
You had to hollow them all down.
Now you got them all partied up and we had to take them all down to the boat.
The students at the party we went to all night.
"So, your high school class was hollowing what students now?"
The students from [?] that were over here - going back and forth to visit.
So then I got to Charlevoix because I'm down at the dock.
The old man was catching the line and stuff.
I'm looking up and here they are.
And they are green.
Some thought it was the greatest thing that ever happened.
I ... at a cattle sale.
A restaurant there.
Because they're working in the restaurants and stuff like that.
It was - I thought I was in love with this one but she was pretty rich so that didn't help any.
For the night.
We had a dance you know.
Do you know what goes on on the internet?
Are you sure you are my teacher?
Are you sure you are my teacher?
(echo)
Are you going to learn how to use the technology?
I am a digital native.
Do computers scare you?
Are you afraid to use them?
Have you been on facebook?
Have you been on twitter?
Have you been surfing?
Do you even know what is on the internet?
Are you going to be my teacher?
Or just that textbook?
Because I want to know... what the world has to offer
And if you are not on the internet... and know nothing about computers. you can't be my teacher!
I said you can't be my teacher.
Make room for somebody who knows how to use the internet.
Do you think I am going to be ready?
Do you think I am going to be ready?
Do you think you are preparing me for the world that I have to live in?
Do you think I am going to be ready?
That's your job!
That's your job!
(echo)
Do you really think it is possible to be an educator in the information age and not use the internet?
"Continue to pretend, maybe the internet is just a fad."
Life was sort of stressful.
I couldn't sleep because of the fact that I was always thinking about how I could pay the creditors.
One of the ways that I thought I could solve it was having a lot of jobs.
At it's peak I had six jobs.
It was hard work because I was taking my annual leave and working weekends and evenings.
You have to appeal to more of their senses in your teaching.
You should almost check a checklist.
"OK, we got sound going on, all right."
Hearing?
Hearing.
What am I doing on visual?
Am I doing any art work?
What am I doing on touch?
Am I getting their hands engaged?
All of that.
I think that happens a lot in the elementary or lower grades.
"And we figure high school, they don't need to do that anymore."
"And I think we're very, very wrong."
It's really the first time Adam Dunning has any positive feelings about
learning.
I feel good about going to school.
"I mean, school here is fun."
It's like the teachers care.
They help you out like regular school should be.
He has come to believe jail time is actually good for him.
Me being locked up was good for a learning experience for me.
"Because if I stayed out, if I didn't get locked up, I'd probably be dead or in a lot worse trouble."
I probably wouldn't be at a treatment facility.
I'd probably be back wearing an orange suit.
"For years, Adams says, he used drugs and alcohol to blunt the pain of his failures in school."
He's clean and sober now but worries about how long that can
last.
"The only thing I'm really afraid of going back to school are the kids around me, pressures."
They seen me before.
The know how I acted before.
I never been to high school when I was clean.
"I mean, it wasn't 30 days where I wasn't using."
"How can I say, you don't learn only the things written in books, but also you prepared for life."
I heard like that.
I know it like that.
Isn't that so?
You learn to differentiate the wrong from good.
"You don't have a diploma only, but also have a specialty that everyone would ask from you."
What kind of privilege is this?
"The simplest one, diploma from here opens many doors for you, you find a job easily, you establish your life even easier... you have a chance to reach your dreams."
This school provides possibilities like this.
So you want an opportunity?
Who doesn't want?
"Good, but what's your dream?"
I want to be a man.
What else can I ask?
Which profession do you want to choose Yaman?
I want to be an architect.
I want to draw the houses where people will be living.
I want it to be like this.
Shall we do something after the registration?
Okay.&amp;gt; But can't let me down at the last moment!
"No, I promise!"
But first let's get these things done.
"The school ambient hit me, I am in a huff in two minutes."
~Mira calling...
Yes sweetie.- Orkun where are you?
"I am at school, what happened?-I need you, can you come to me for a little?"
Where are you?
"By the seaside.- Why are you crying, what happened?"
I started a nightmare day...
I took my car from the sequestration police a little before.
This is all I can tell you.
"Oh no ! &amp;gt; My dad said, take it away quickly."
"So, if these things are true, than we'll say that these two pairs are equivalent."
Ok?
Ok.
"Now, that's a relation."
Is it an equivalence relation?
There's some things to check here.
Right?
"We won't do them all, but do you want you to think that..."
"So here's the important thing to do, once you have a construction, the work is not done, you should check that it is an equivalence relation."
Check tilde is an equivalence relation.
"So, for instance, is it reflexive?"
Some of you said yes right away and some of you hesitated.
How would I check if it's reflexive?
What would I have to check to check the reflexive condition for this relation?
Which is on pairs of pairs?
Right?
"You give me a pair and another pair, how would I check... what would I have to check for reflexivity?"
What do I wanna check?
What's the condition I wanna check?
What corresponds to a R a over there?
"Yeah, is p q equivalent to p q?"
"Now, does everybody agree this is what we have to check?"
"It's not the only thing, but it's one of the things."
Yeah?
"Ok, good, now, is this easy to check?"
"Well, then you go back to this definition, since this is why definitions are so important in Mathematics, because we know what we mean, we have a definition."
What does it mean to check p q tilde p q?
It means checking that... p q equal q p.
Is that true?
For integers.
Yes.
Ok?
"-What the (bleep) is happenin', forum?"
"Listen, if you have a girlfriend, don't put her  on an ATV and make her ramp things."
-(man) Here we go.
Oh-ho!
(laughing):
Oh no!
-And wouldn't it be polite to make sure she  hasn't broken her neck before you start laughing?
"I mean, look at that."
I think she may have actually kissed her own ass.
"(man in video laughing) Yeah, you hear this dumbass laughing?"
"Epic boyfriend FAlL man, really."
Are you guys ready for it?
Are you guys ready for the cutest six seconds ever!!
Ever!!
"That you'll ever!! see in your life, ever?!!"
Check it out.
So damn cute!
"That's actually a viral video back from 2007, but, I mean, look at them."
"I want that one, that one, that one, and that one."
"But not that one, 'cause he looks like an (bleep)hole."
"Seriously though, cutest furry little bastards ever!!"
"All right, this last video, it's simple, it's incredible, it's tragic..."
"You know, just watch."
(imitates crash)
"Now, this video really bothers me."
Mainly because the woman isn't doing stupid.
"She isn't playing with gasoline, she isn't drag-racing, she isn't playing with sharp objects, but yet she still gets hurt."
And I feel so bad for her... that I'm actually still gonna do the super slow-motion replay over the funny voiceover.
"-(high-pitched voiceover singing) Stack these cans, all day long"
Stack these cans While I sing this song
"Hey, I didn't know creamed corn is on sale..."
Whoa!
[Student speaking].
Interesting.
"That's not something I'm going to demand right away, but what's a more important consideration?"
Second row here.
[Student speaking].
"Good, tell me your name... n cannot equal zero, David said."
"So m, n are in Z and n is not zero."
Ok?
"This is one possible answer you might give to this question, but it is not very satisfactory, for a few reasons."
Probably the most important reason is... we have no idea what this notation means.
What do you mean by m over n?
Right?
What's that mean?
The integers don't have a division defined on them.
Right?
What does it mean?
"Ok, so I'm just gonna say this is not quite good enough."
Because we don't know what you mean by... what's this symbol.
What does this mean?.
"Ok, so, let's try to be a little more careful."
And we can be guided by what we do know.
"So, let's think about the motivation."
"So, when we think about fractions, you know, we're usually thinking about trying to teach children something about dividing,"
"I don't know, cakes into pieces or something like that, right?"
"So, you know, you might for instance take a cake, which looks remarkably like an interval"
"[Laughter]... and dividing it into, I don't know, three pieces, and giving somebody one of those three pieces, ok?"
"We have a name for this fraction, we call it?"
One third.
Right?
Ok.
One third.
"Which really means one part of three, right?"
"I like the white, white pages."
"White, easy to read white stuff."
We get some people in here that like to work too much.
"White on the dark, and making him really dizzy. ,, ."
"I used to, um, I used to be in charge of a lot of the websites for a university."
And I imagine that dealing with academia is very similar to dealing with the government. .
"Oh, yeah."
"Well, science is academia, science at Stanford."
"Exactly, it is."
"Really challenging, and I feel your pain. ,, ."
"Yeah, but it's, it's, it's, yeah."
"It's a, it's a challenge.'Cause I do want done."
"And, you know, it is hard to work on a team."
"Because everyone has a different, uh, view of what a website should look like."
"Well, and I think that the biggest challenge for me was getting, getting."
People to understand that the website isn't about them and it shouldn't be what they want.
"It should be for the audience, who is going to the website and how do they consume information in, in the easiest, most efficient way."
Yeah.
Right.
And that's what the content management system department.
"Exactly. , can be the other way around."
"But um, I, like I said, you're side is very helpful, I, you guys have so many good programs I wish I had more time to just sit and just watch some of them."
And then I got this new DA 100 camera but there's really not much happening there for that one. .
"But uh, we do have some digital uh reflex uh, it's at least for the moving piece, um, that's the part I. Used to."
"I mean, I bet my constant was a negative 79."
"I mean, forever."
"But uh, there's digital ones that are, they, they have a lot more stuff, they're a"
little more complicated.
They do.
"I have um, a 90, a D 90."
"The, oh yeah, yeah, the"
D 90.
"40 would be for the average female adult, 50 would be for the average male adult."
"But it's funny, we don't tell that to kids."
"I only learned this recently myself, too."
"Going through my whole life, and never really bothering to find out."
And nobody ever bothered to tell me.
"It's like saying,"
"""Here, have the keys to my car, go pick up some stuff for me, go get my groceries."" But I didn't teach you how to drive the car."
"Teaching kids, ""You got to eat it"", but not teaching them how, or how much."
"Now, again, let me show you how easy it is to get protein."
Especially here in the United States.
"Your standard American diet for breakfast, you got your bacon, you got your cow's milk, and you got your hen periods."
How many slices of bacon would you want?
"I know you might not eat bacon now, but how many slices do you remember as a kid, maybe?"
"Maybe 2, OK?"
Each slice is 5 grams.
Two times five.
How many eggs would you want?
2?
Each egg has 6 grams.
So what are we at?
10 + 12 is 22.
How many glass of milk?
One glass.
Each glass has 8 grams.
So you are at what?
30.
"We are not even done with breakfast, this is not including the toast with cow's butter you might put on it."
"So, you are not even done with breakfast, and you are almost at the limit."
"The average American does not need to worry about getting enough protein, they need to worry about getting too much protein."
That's why the U.S. has the highest rates obesity in the entire world.
"And people always tell me, ""Jesus."
What?
I think I can be a better man.
"Young Master, have you fallen in love with me?"
"Well, I mean..."
"You did all this today, ... and I'm a bit dumb about stuff like that."
Really?
"If you've realized that you're too dumb to realize something like this,"
I must have...
Think about it carefully.
So am I too dumb to realize it or not?
What did he mean by that?
Chang Hui.
So his name was Chang Hui!
She may not be worthy enough to marry into Yongmun.
Lady!
Lady!
My Yi Nok... my Yi Nok...!
She must have been a noblewoman from a great family.
"I hid the truth because I worried about the danger, but now I think I should find her real name."
"If I find her real name, will we find her enemy as well?"
"We found an explosives dealer, but he died before he could be questioned."
"A noble prince of royal blood, and a criminal who sells women to China..."
How could they make a deal together?
"If he wants to do something in secret, he will have no choice but to deal with men like him."
He is spraying filthy blood in order to dethrone me!
"The child of a queen of noble blood, ...or a child of a filthy palace maid..."
We both act exactly the same!
"Your Majesty, you must listen to the woes of the people before the prince appears."
You must bring them to your side!
"If you continue to neglect your duties and dally in women and alcohol, the people's anger towards you will turn into a welcome for the prince."
People can be so stupid!
The prince is a monster just like me!
Why do they want him?
"My lord, this isn't small issue."
That shop means everything to me.
My means of earning.
The only way to support my family.
And I built that shop with hard work.
"Now, it's just a piece of land."
And no one's ready to buy that as well.
"These people say,  "" Donate with faith.. """
""" ..and you'll never be wronged "" ."
"And the insurance people say  "" Pay your premiums on time.. """
""" ..we're there in your troubled times "" ."
I gave donations and also paid my premiums.
But none of them are willing to help me.
I am an ordinary human.
A middle-class man.
"My family, my wife and children.. ..will be forced to live on streets."
"No, my lord."
You'll have to give me a chance.. ..to defend my case in this court.
And the constituency of lndia gives me the right.. ..to voice my plea in this court.
"So please, my lord."
One crore is a big amount for a middle-class businessman.
"And especially, when it's a question of his survival."
"So, the court accepts Kanji Lalji Mehta's case."
Silence.
"And only after carefully examining.. ..all the evidences and arguments.. ..the court will give its verdict, whether.. ..Mr. Mr. Kanji Lal will get his compensation or not."
"And if he does, then who will pay him?"
"The insurance company or, the temple."
The court's adjourned for the day.
Wait.
Wait.
You can perform all the veneration you want.. ..and ring those bells as many times you wish.
Your God razed down my shop.
And that is curve fitting.
I am Francesc Alted.
I work for
"Continuum Analytics. and during my tutorial, I would like to introduce you to to Numexpr and Cython, as libraries that can help you to accelerate operations with NumPy."
Can everyone hear me well?
All I wanna say Girl I wanna say
Saying I'm sorry
"August 4th, we were chilling at the house Said I'm done, I told you to get out"
Didn't mean a word that I said Cause I was hoping you would come back
Cause I tried and tried And I cried and cried
Up late at night and I'm hurt And I tried to fight and I cried to God
"Ooh, please let it just work And I'm going crazy with you"
"You got me so confused Cause you walked away, and I walked away"
And we should've stayed baby
All you have to do is say that I'm sorry Baby I'm sorry
"And I'm in love with you Baby I want this, baby I want it"
Say baby I'll do what it takes And I will be here all the way baby
All you have to do is say that I'm sorry Baby I'm sorry

"To tell the truth I've thinking bout you lately I miss you, miss you, miss you, I miss you"
"Christmas day, you said you had a ring But you changed your mind"
Too caught up in the streets Boy your truth is hard to believe
Why are you really scared of me
Cause I tried and tried And I cried and cried
And up late at night and I hurt Cause I put in mine and worked all the time
And you never put in your work And I'm going crazy with you

"And I'm in love with you Baby I want this, baby I want it"
Say baby I'll do what it takes And I will be here all the way baby
All you have to do is say that I'm sorry Baby I'm sorry
"""If I were to be reborn, I would still choose Gong Jung Han"""
We were thinking the same thing.
I'll begin.
"20 years after my marriage, people still ask me."
Why of all people did you marry that man?
"""You fell in love not wit a rich man, a top star, but with an announcer."""
"And finally, someone asked me if I was insane."
"So, I responded."
I fell in love with Gong Jung Han and since our love is crazy...
"Yes, I am insane."
"I told you, right?"
I have someone who makes my heart beat.
"It's this Guy, My lover."
I brought him so he can move in with our family.
Someone you love?
Someone who makes your heart beat?
I'm Clara Oswald.
I was born to save the doctor.
Noooooo
There is one place you must never ever find yourself.
"Whatever you think you're doing, don't."
[soft music plays]
"I guess love to me... is meant to be, you know, that warm feeling inside."
"Love is meant to make everything right, and everything complete, and everything whole."
"Love is meant to be, you know, as you see in the movies, the guy that pops into the screen, and steals your heart, and then never wants to leave."
"It's meant to be that white picket fence, that happy home."
"Like, I've looked for love... but I can't say I've found it in any one person or in any thing."
The first thing I think about is pain.
"You know, it's... to me it's scary."
It's vulnerable... and love really really hurts I guess.
"I don't want to feel loved by them, I don't want to love them. 'cause it just hurts and I guess I've been hurt one too many times by people and,"
"I've gone there too much, that it just scares the hell out of me, so when I get close to feeling love, I'll run."
"I object, Your Honour."
Mr. Kanji is calling service to God a business.
Of course it's business.
Take a visit to any religious place.
First you've to pay for parking.
"Then, pay for standing in the smaller queue."
"Then pay for the flowers, blanket, candle."
And the donation box is kept right before the idol.
"As soon as you bow down, you've to put something in it."
And they even charge for the offerings of God.
Just like we're charged for seeing wax statues in the museum.
"Similarly, they charge us for seeing the stone idols in temples."
And the priests have salaries as well.
"His is less, and his is more."
And you even have income tax benefits.
Right?
"So, where's the service?"
"And, Your Honour, there's never recession in this business."
No.
"ln fact, they do better business during recession. "" Oh, God!"
"Oh my, God! """
Relax.
Consider that it is a business.
"Still, why are you asking them for compensation?"
You pay premiums for your insurance.. ..so you can ask them for a compensation.
But why will the temple pay you?
Because...l've paid premiums in their temples as well.
- What?
What nonsense?
I knew you won't believe me.. ..so I have brought all the proofs along.
Look.
These are the receipts of the premium.. ..l've been paying for the last 18 years.
How are things?
My dad is not back yet...
"We don't know his where about- Oh,really?"
"He sent a message, only to me."
"""I am out of the city, I have to clear my head a bit, don't worry and so on"" - he wrote.."
So much.
"- Good thing,that he informed you.."
I have a terrible headache.
"If you want we can stop in a ""Pharmacy"", before you get the forest street."
"No, i already took some medicines, i have always these migraines..."
If I have the pain I can't open my eyes.
Now of course got worse...-Then we turn off the air conditioner and open the widows..
The air comes in.
Open your side too.
"If there was a little support for Faruk, if there was a source to handle his assets for some months,"
I know he will pull himself together.
There are some things he is waiting for but...
"Don't cry my dear, don't cry.."
Everything went so wrong...
The only thing I can't endure in this life is woman's tears.
"Don't do it, please."
"For sure, there must be a way to save us from this situation.."
The only way is to pay the debts...
Unfortunately..
The wares can't compensate the debt.. then everything will be sold... whoever buys it.
"Ender also will have to wait fairly to get her debt back, I know this."
What has Ender to do with it?
You did not know?
Faruk borrowed money from Ender too.
Exactly 500.000 US dollars.
"Leave it for Gods sake, this is all humbug (palaver)..."
I wonder why are you so cruel when it comes to Faruk?
So this is going to be 9 plus 27 is 36.
So that is 36.
"And if we want to add it to negative 81 over 4, we just have to find a common denominator."
"So all of this business is going to be equal to 2 pi times-- and so our common denominator can be 4, times something over 4."
"We have negative 81 over 4, and then 36 times 4 is 144."
Is that right?
"Yeah, that's 144."
"So 36 times 4, so it's plus 144."
30 times 4 is 120 plus another 24 is 144.
"So you have 144, essentially, minus 81."
"So this is going to be equal to 2 pi times-- and actually, I can even simplify it"
"little bit more, because we have a 2 here and a 4 there."
So divide the numerator and denominator by 2 so you get it over 2.
So you're going to have pi times-- this is going to be 44.
Let's see.
"If this was an 80, this would be 64."
So it's going to be 63.
Let me write it this way.
It's going to be 63 pi over 2.
Did I do that right?
60 plus 81 is 141.
"Add another 3, you get a 144."
Yep.
And we're done.
We figured out the volume of our front of jet engine-looking shape.

I dreamed a dream in time gone by.
"When hope was high, and life worth living..."
I dreamed that love would never die...
I dreamed that God would be forgiving...
"And I was young and unafraid... and dreams were made and used and wasted... there was no ransom to be paid... no song unsung, no wine untasted... but the tigers come at night... with their voices soft as thunder... as they tear your life apart... as they turn your dream to shame... and still I dream he'll come to me that we will live the years together but there are dreams that cannot be..."
There are storms we cannot weather...
I don't want to return to the beginning again now.
Come on!
I had very difficult childhood.
there were so many things i did not have in my life.
"I didn't know about the comfort of a bed at all... a warm house, sleeping with a full stomach , to dream of beautiful things..."
But now i know..
"When one is in poverty it doesn't impose so much, because there is nothing, , nothing!"
One is subzero...
"But now is difficult,Mira."
I don't want to lose these.
At least that will not happen...
"When we met with Faruk, he loved an ignorant but beautiful girl."
"I did everything,.. so he loved me."
"From the day I walked out of that neighborhood, I didn't return there again ,never looked back."
I wanted to forget..
"And, I did forget."
"I wanted Asude to be Sude,"
And it happened like that...
"I know the value of my life better ,than any other women , who lives this kind of life.."
That i don't want to lose ..
Do you understand?
"I don't want my children to live in bad conditions , which i had as kid.."
I don't want you to worry about your future.
So you won't have to climb through life..
"Mom, please!"
"Don't write tragedy scenarios right away, for God's sake"
Nothing will be as you think.
"Above all, i trust my dad."
You trust the man who licked the dust in front of everyone.?
"Don't do it, for Gods sake."
"Okay, i mean i also will not forget what happened this evening."
"but I am not in love with this sort of life, as much as you are."
Subtract 8 from both sides of this.
You get x could also be equal to negative 8.
Let's do one more.
"Just to really, really get the point drilled in your head."
Let's do one more.
Let's say we have 4x squared minus 25 is equal to 0.
So you might already see the pattern.
This is an a squared.
This is a b squared.
"We have the pattern of a squared minus b squared, where, in this case, a would be equal to x, right?"
This is 2x squared.
And b would be equal to 5.
"So if you have a squared minus b squared, this is going to be equal to a plus b times a minus b."
"In this situation, that means that 4x squared minus 25 is going to be 2x plus 5 times 2x minus 5."
"And of course, that will be equal to 0."
And this will only be equal to 0 if either 2x plus 5 is equal to 0 or 2x minus 5 is equal to 0.
And then we can solve each of these.
Subtract 5 from both sides.
You get 2x is equal to negative 5.
Divide both sides by 2.
You could get one solution is negative 5/2.
"Over here, add 5 to both sides."
You get 2x is equal to positive 5.
Divide both sides by 2.
You get x could also be equal to positive 5/2.
So both of these satisfy that equation up there.
Now we can write down our precise definition of dimension.
"So if we do what we've been doing, we create a geometric structure from a given D-dimensional object,"
"like a 1-dimensional object like a line, a 2-dimensional object like a square, etc., by repeatedly dividing the length of its sides by some number N."
"So, when we were bisecting the sides , the number N was two (2)."
"When we were trisecting the number N was 3, and so on."
"This is our recipe, and we saw that at each new level we got N raised to the D (N^D) copies of the previous level."
And so then what we can do now is plot these things.
So let's do the following.
I'm sorry.
How many coeffients of A and B which you were two of them which.
"You're trying to get new a's and b's. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; I'm sure like with many of those, like 35. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Yeah, you can give, if you have something a higher, for instance, if you want to fit it a parabola, ax^2 + bx + cx, you've passed in a, b, c and you'll find out Yeah."
"The higher dimensional, the harder it is to, you get a lot more local, it finds a local minima, not your global minima."
"Your guessing is very important in this, 'kay?"
"The higher, the, the more complicated your guess, or the, your thing you're trying to minimize, the curve you're trying to fit to, the more important it is to have a really good guess."
"So there are my coefficients, A and B, and let me do this here for A1 too and B1, and these are, so now what we want to do is say okay, my data, let's say XP for X plot, pretty much goes from zero To five, and now we'll just say is my y2 fit, What is it?"
It's a2 * xp
"*, oh + b2."
"There's my curve fit, y1 is gonna be a1 * xp * b1."
"And now I can say, hold on, and I will plot xp versus y2."
"And lets plot the L2 fit in red and the y, and the y1, L1 fit in magenta."
Sound good.
"Oh, here, yeah, thank you."
Okay.
There we are.
Look at that.
Beautiful!
I have an L2 fit and an L1 fit.
And look at that.
They kind of don't look very much different.
Like you don't really expect them to look that much different I suppose.
Okay?
Everybody good with that?
There's my data.
"And you can see that the L2 and L1, slightly different, especially up here, but slightly different."
"Now here's t he question I'm gonna ask, and this is why L1 becomes important."
We think about our data Pretty easy thing about putting a line there.
"Now, what would happen if i had out-layers."
"Now, lets talk about that formula a little bit."
Let's just make some funny tails.
Twist about two inch bubble at the end of each balloon.
And force the bubble to the very end of the flat tail.
Do it with all four balloons.
"I know, it does not look like a crane now."
Some silly sculpture... anyway.
We are going to improve it now.
We are going to use one more balloon to make the crane's arm.
Inflate a balloon.
I use a brown balloon
leaving about eight inch flat tail.
Oh!
I forgot to mention.
Not for this sculpture. but with regards to many other sculptures.
We can use technique desribed in this instruction to wrap balloon in balloons.
Now let's fix the crane's arm.
Just force the brown balloon through both sides of the cabin.
That is the simplest crane's arm.
"Again, we can make funny tail."
It will represent the hook.
Let's make this bubble up to one inch size.
This time I am going to tie a knot to secure the funny tail at the end of the balloon.
It is a necessary precaution.
Be course my young son will play with this crane.
As all we know all unlocked bubbles doomed to be deflated in hands of little kids.
Here I twist two small soft bubbles.
And lock all ends of those two bubbles in one lock twist.
"Actually,"
I twist one bubble.
Lock both ends and split the bubble on two bubbles.
"In anyways, it will look the same."
It looks ... ridiculous.
He was just as light on his feet as - you couldn't imagine a guy that size could be as light on his feet in step dance.
"The Donie guys, of course, Peter and Patsy, they used to always..."
"Patsy, Peter, and..."
Patsy worked for me.
Best worker I had.
But Peter and
Lester would - They'd get up...
Friendly rivalry.
Which was good.
"Could you describe a typical party at night or something, where they'd be playing music?"
"Yeah, they'd play the music."
They had the chairs sitting around the hall.
The parish hall?
"Wouldn't have any tables set up unless it was a dinner or a wedding, you know."
"So here you are, you're trying to dance and you've got everybody in the aisle and all these old women standing there watching you."
So you're not really doing too much dancing.
"Jack [?] would set up a stable right outside there, right around the corner where they..."
They'd have a keg of beer out there.
"Because it wasn't - the bar wasn't in the - in fact, the kitchen was where the bar is now."
And where the kitchen is was the high school.
That's what they...
There at the parish hall?
Yeah.
"And then when they finally quit using that, they made that into a little library too."
In 1960.
Even when they first put the other stuff out.
They wouldn't have any alcohol in the parish hall.
They'd have the keg sitting on a table outside.
"Yeah, just a table thing there."
And then - so continue with that scene.
"Well, that'd be it."
And they'd just play the music.
And each of these wires connect two
letters into a pair.
"So in this case, you might see, the letter Q is going to connect with the letter E. Now you make 10 of those pairs."
Two letters in a pair will swap over.
"So if Q is connected to E, then Q and E would swap over."
That's an extra level of scrambling only available to the military.
"Now, this had the most number of combinations."
"Now, this calculation is going to be the hardest calculation, but we can do it."
So there are 26 letters in the alphabet.
How many ways to arrange 26 letters?
"Well, it's 26 times 25 times 24 all the way down to 1."
That's 26 factorial.
But we don't want every combination of 26 letters.
We only want to make 10 pairs.
"So that means there are 6 letters left over, which we don't care about."
"Because we don't care about them, that means we're allowed to divide."
And we're going to divide by 6 factorial.
Now there are 10 pairs.
We don't care what order those 10 pairs are in.
"Because we don't care about it, we can divide by 10 factorial."
"And the last thing to divide by, 2 letters in a pair."
"Well, if I swap them over, that would still be the same pair."
"If I had A and B, that's the same as B and A. That's still the same pair."
So I can divide by 2.
And I do that for each pair.
"There's 10 pairs, so I'm going to divide by 2 10 times."
Just 2 to power 10.
And that is how many ways that you can connect 20 letters into 10 pairs on the front of the machine.
How big is that number?
Shall we do that?
"150 trillion, 738 billion, 274 million, 937,250."
"So the total, 158 quintillion, 962 quadrillion, 555 trillion, 217 billion, 826 million, 360,000 flat."
"And if you multiplied that times that, you'd get 1."
Part B.
I'll do all of these.
We have 2/8.
"The inverse of 2/8 is 1 over 2/8, which is the same thing-- this is equal to 1 times the inverse of this."
"Times 8/2, which is the same thing as 4."
"Now immediately, you might see something."
"I guess, you see a pattern here."
"If I take 1 over a fraction, the result is the fraction swapped."
So the inverse of 2/8 is 8/2.
You just swap the numerator and the denominator.
So let's apply that to part C.
"If I have negative 19/21, its inverse is just going to be you swap the numerator and the denominator."
Negative 21/19.
"And if you were to multiply these two numbers, you would get 1."
The negatives would cancel out.
"The 21 and the 21 would cancel out, the 19 and the 19 would cancel out."
Part D.
"The inverse of 7, multiplicative inverse, is 1/7."
"And then finally, let's do E."
So the inverse of-- so they give us z to the third over-- so it's negative z to the third over 2xy to the third.
"So the multiplicative inverse of that-- one of the harder words for me to say-- is just going to be equal to-- so that's the inverse-- is going to be 1 over this, which is just going to be negative."
The denominator becomes the numerator.
2y to the third over z cubed.
Now let's go to this next section.
Divide the following rational numbers.
Be sure that your answer is in simplest form.
"So I'm just going to do every other one of these problems, just so that I don't use up all of your time."
So let's do this first one: part A.
"Well, I'll do it over here."
Part A. 5/2 divided by 1/4.
This is the same thing as 5/2 times 4/1.
"Come all the way down to n, which is the"
"last line, come back up."
Drop it down.
There.
So now we have to drop some matrices in here or vectors in here with one and 1's with occasional 0's and 0's with occasional 1's okay.
So how do we do that.
"So, let's, let's come here and let's build zero vector, E0 is 0's end by one."
This is a vector of 0's.
Okay what we're going to do is do the following.
First of all let's take the let's make a vector of e2 which is just e1.
So I'm going to copy the one vectors.
"And what I'm gonna to do with e2 is I am going to, to occasionally put in zero."
How often do I put in a zero?
Well every nth point.
"Remember M, M is the small, is the small matrices in there."
"And, by the way, part of your homework three is going to be all about convincing yourself about this stuff."
"Because you're just going to be, your gonna emmese, immerse yourself in building matrices."
"That's all homework three is because you gotta build a derivative matrix and X derivative and Y and then, this."
"So, we're going to do, is for J equals one to M cuz that's how many, M blocks I have, remember, n by n, and I have these n by n blocks and there's m of them."
Now I am going to go down for each block and what I am gonna do is the following.
"For E2,"
Put an occasional zero.
Alright.
"So, Jay is going to one second."
Jay's going to go one.
"So, the first thing he is going to do is say y is five."
"So, he's going to go down to the fifth component."
Put a zero.
"And then Jay is going to be two, it's going to be the tenth component."
Put a zero.
"So, it's a bunch of ones, fifth component, tenth component."
All the way down.
So line I can be 6x plus 5y is equal to 3.
So if we were to subtract 6x from both sides you get 5y is equal to minus 6x plus 3.
And then you divide both sides by 5 and you get y is equal to minus 6/5 x plus 3/5.
So this is line I right here.
I'll do line q in a different color.
So q is 5x minus 6y is equal to 0.
So let's subtract 5x from both sides.
You get minus 6y is equal to minus 5x.
"If you divide both sides by negative 6, you get y is equal to-- minus 5 divided by negative 6."
That's 5/6 x.
"Well, it actually looks like D comes into play."
Because the slope of this one is minus 6/5.
That's the slope of line l.
The slope of line q is the inverse of that made negative.
At this point it's a good thing to memorize.
I haven't proven it to you yet.
"If you want a line that has a slope perpendicular to this one, or a line that is perpendicular to this one will have a negative inverse slope."
So the inverse of this is minus 5/6 and the negative inverse is plus 5/6.
So this is the negative inverse of that.
So these lines are actually perpendicular.
So that is D.
See you in the next video.
We're on problem 27.
"And the question is, which equation best represents the graph above?"
"So before even looking at the choices, let's see what we can figure out about the graph."
So what's its y-intercept?
"So if we said that this is the equation of a line, we said y is equal to mx plus b where m is the slope and y is-- and b is the y-intercept."
"It's late, I'm getting slightly muddled."
So what's the y-intercept?
"Well when x is equal to 0, y is equal to 0."
So this is going to be equal to 0.
The y-intercept is 0.
"And by the way, if you come over here to your MATLAB code and say, what's, what's"
A?
Notice how A is saved.
"The one wants components one, two, two is one."
"It only saves what it needs to, Okay?"
"So normally when you say A it , prints out this giant matrix to your screen."
"And it's just saying look, here are the components that are nonzero Yeah."
"I want to add like 68 equals twelve, do you blow the sparseness, or [inaudible] can you say A bracket, six comma A equals twelve, do you then add that point?"
And it's still sparse?
"Yeah, yeah, you can do this, check this out, yeah."
"A six comma twelve is equal to seven, because we like seven right?"
Huh?
"It's the best number ever, and we can just say spy that and check it out."
There's Taylor's number right over there.
It's a seven.
Still sparks.
You can do anything you want now.
Okay.
We're going to keep that there.
"And then by the way, I can put down diagonals anywhere I want now."
Let's put down another row of 1's at one.
Look at that.
I put it one diagonal over.
"As I said go to one, which is the next one over."
Put down ones.
Now our matrix is a little more complicated.
"I encourage you to look at page, whatever in the notes, where I actually show you what this thing looks like.'Kay?"
"And, this thing has a complicated structure, in particular, I guess we could Actually, I have it in my notes, so let m, e let me, let me draw this what this thing looks like."
"Do we have, turn the lights up here real quick?"
And then Alright.
So let me just show you what this thing
looks like.
It was too damn hard !
some of you already know that it's hard.
It's not easy.
It's hard changing your life !
"That in the process working on your dreams you are going to incur a lot of disappointment, a lot of failure, a lot of pain, a lot of set backs and a lot of defeats."
"At moments when you ""re going to doubt yourself and say:"
"""God why is this happening to me,"
"I'm just trying to take care of my children, my mother."
I'm not trying to steal or rob from anybody.
How does this have to happen to me?
"For those of you all that have experienced some hardships, don't give up on your dream."
Pain is temporary.
"It may last a minute, or an hour, or a day, or a year,"
but eventually it will subside and something else will take its place.
"If I quit, however, it lasts forever."
Talent you have naturally.
Skill is only developed by hours and hours... ...and hours of beating on your craft.
"I will not go down, THAT WAY!"
"it's about no days off no weekends, no holidays, no birthdays."
Listen to me!
No days off!
No half days!
No holidays!
No snow day!
It's about gaining the competitive edge.
It's about separation.
It's about separating yourself from the past !
"I choose to rise, not fall!"
"I choose to live, not die!!"
I choose to fight back!
Here we go come with me there's a world out there that we should see take my hand close your eyes with you right here
I'm a rockateer
We could write 3 plus 2 is equal to 5.
Term three is minus 5.
And that's because minus 1 times this 5-- let me draw these arrows-- is equal to minus 5.
And then we add again-- I'm going to switch colors just to keep it interesting.
"So term four is going to be minus 5 plus 2, which equals minus 3."
"Then term five is going to be minus 3 times minus 1, which equals 3 again."
Right?
And I think you see how we're getting these patterns.
You just keep switching between adding 2 and multiplying by negative 1.
And then so term six is going to be what?
"It's going to be this plus 2, which is 5."
I think you're seeing the pattern again.
Let me do a bunch more and I'll do it outside of the scope of this chart.
The term seven is going to be what?
"It's going to be minus 1 times that, so minus 5."
And you see the pattern now.
Term eight is going to be minus 3.
Term nine is going to be what?
"Minus 3, minus 3."
So here we added 2 so we multiply it by negative 1.
So it's going to be 3 again.
And you could just experiment with yourself.
"Once you understand how soon. the sequence works, do a bunch of terms until you see a cycle."
And that's the key thing.
"In any SAT problem, when they ask you like what is the 100th term?"
It's going to have a cycle because they don't expect you to sit and write out 100 terms because you would run out of time.
"So if they ask you the 100th term, the pattern probably repeats every three or four or five or, at most, six terms."
And then you can use that to figure out what the 100th term is.
"So here we see that the pattern repeats-- let's see, 3, 5, negative 5, negative 3."
"3, 5, negative 5, negative 3, 3."
"So we see it repeats every fourth term, right?"
"This is kind of one cycle, then 3, 5, negative 3, and this is another cycle."
3 times 3 is 9.
We did the whole thing.
They're just repeating the same question.
That equals 10.
That's choice B.
Rewind the video and see what I did here.
3 times 3 is 9 times minus 3i plus 3i minus i squared.
"These terms cancel out and you get a minus i squared, which is minus negative 1."
"So you have 9 plus 1, so that equals 10."
So that is choice B.
That's crazy.
They just gave us the same problem twice in a row.
All right.
They're giving us more and more imaginary problems.
"But these are fun, especially if they're going to repeat the same question."
"Problem 30, if i is equal to the square root of negative 1-- well, I'll just keep writing it because they keep writing it."
It's good as a reminder. i is equal to the square root of negative 1 and a and b are non-zero real numbers.
What is 1 over a plus bi?
"Well, once again, if they kind of want us to rewrite this, they probably just want us to get rid of the i's in the denominator."
So we multiply times the conjugate of this complex number.
"So we multiply times a plus bi, the conjugate over the conjugate, a plus bi."
The conjugate isn't this whole thing.
The conjugate is just a plus bi.
"Oh sorry, we should be multiplying times a minus bi. a minus bi over a minus bi."
"The conjugate of a plus bi, just so you get the terminology right, is just the a minus bi."
But I'm doing a minus bi over a minus bi.
So I'm not changing this fraction because this obviously is 1. x over x is the same thing as 1.
So let's see what this is equal to.
"Well, the numerator just becomes a minus bi times 1, which is a minus bi."
"Then you have a times a, which is a squared. a times minus bi, so it's minus abi."
"Then you have bi times a, which is plus abi."
I'll write it down here.
And um.
"It sounds like the level of reference is working well for you, right now."
Yeah.
"You don't have on your website like, if you're an advanced person, or a beginner."
You don't have those kind of groupings?
We don't.
"We're working on it. , I don't know if you've seen some of those websites where they actually have kind of portals to deal with beginners and things like that."
Speakers:
Yeah.
"But you don't have it, like tailored for those kind of."
Things on the site.
Would that be helpful for you as a user?
"Yeah, I think that would be helpful for me.'Cause I am, I've been using a lot of these programs that I would not."
"I mean, some of those are really very basic beginning stuff."
"I mean, I mean, stuff, stuff will cross over, of course."
"Like, , when you have a new."
"I need product and stuff, they probably want an analysis, start to get in what those things are, and upgrade."
"But on the other things, too."
"I also like, too, that, you know, when you have those ones that show pictures of artists."
"Creative, um..."
"Oh, creative inspiration?"
Yeah.
I do like watching some of those and the artists.
"Those are very, very nice."
"It's, it's weird the way that you guys have them listed, though."
"Ah, it."
It's always hard for me to remember how to find it.
Mm-hm.
"Let's call it documentary, but this ."
Yeah.
"Navigation wise subject, like I wasn't to know that when I sort of, of , something. these guys beginning. ."
"Where, the, the, the stories."
So we're going to add 5 again and get to 16.
Let's do 4 just for good measure.
"So the fourth one, we're going to add another 5-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5."
"So the fourth one, we're going to add another 5 gets us to 21."
"Now, I want to think about, can we, using this pattern, figure out how many toothpicks it would take for us to, say, make 50 of these townhouses or even 500 of these townhouses, or even 5,000 of them?"
Now we just have to look at this pattern here and see can we come up with an equation for each of these actual values?
"So, for example, we see a pattern that-- well, we already recognize that we started with 6, and we're adding 5 every time we add a house."
"So when you add the second house, you add 5 once."
"The third house, you start with 6, and you add 5 twice."
"The fourth house, you start with 6 and you add 5 three times."
So let's actually write that down.
"So 21 is equal to-- you start with 6, you start with this 6 here, and then you add 5 three times, plus 5 times 3."
"When you had the 3 houses, once again, you started with 6 and you added 5 two times."
Let me do that same color.
And you added 5 two times.
Plus 5 times 2.
"When you had 2 houses, you started with 6 again."
"This is equal to 6 and you added 5 once, so plus 5 times 1."
"And then when you had 1 house-- and it'll fit the same pattern-- you started with 6, and how many times did you add 5?"
"Well, you didn't add 5."
You could say that you added 5 zero times.
So you might see a little pattern here.
"However many houses you needed, you take one less than that and multiply it by 5, add that to 6, and you get the number of toothpicks."
"And actually, let me rewrite this."
So I could rewrite this as 6 plus 5 times 4 minus 1.
I could write this as 6 plus 5 times 3 minus 1.
You could write this as 6 plus 5 times 2 minus 1.
You could rewrite this as 6 plus 5 times 1 minus 1.
And maybe that makes a pattern a little bit clearer.
This 4 is right over here.
This 3 is right over here.
This 2 is right over here.
Peshawar and they've got rotor conveyors from the mess hall - little dinky ones.
"And they have big heavy duty ones and they're making these guys - the cooks, because they don't have a load crew there."
It was just a spook base.
They have the U-2s and the
RB57's and stuff like that there.
All spy stuff.
So we loaded it all up and I got it ready [?] comes out and hands me a can of beer and he already knew because we joked about this before.
"He put a can of beer under the front crew door and when I just barely touched the top, the plane was perfectly balanced."
Not [?] but you can fake it.
"Anyway, I did that and then I had him jump up and down the back."
"All these guys, to get it to rock a little - see how it stabilizes, you know."
But what I didn't realize was the wheels - they put the wheels on the ramp that slopes up in the back of the plane.
"So anyway, I chained it down."
You could really chain stuff.
He's back out there and I'm ...
They're tying it down and everything.
"So he says, ""Well, what do you think?"""
"I said, ""I'll sit in front of it."""
"He said, ""If you sit in front of it, I'll fly it."" I said okay."
So we take off and it was just a little bit tail heavy.
Not bad.
So we got down to Karachi and I just moved it forward about two inches.
That's all it took.
Swinging on into Germany.
Same damn thing again.
We pulled in there and we just backed a 40-foot flatbed up to the back end they dropped the ramp out and put a wench on it so we pulled the tires and they skidded this thing off.
There's another one of these E8s from Washington.
Wants to know where my manifest is.
I didn't have one.
How do you know this is it?
He's looking at this big trailer.
He knows it's not a ...
Let's do this last problem right here.
"The world's largest trench digger, Bagger 288, moves at 3/8 miles per hour."
"So its speed, or its velocity, or its rate is equal to 3/8 miles per hour."
We could write it like this.
How long will it take to dig a trench 2/3 miles long?
So we want to go a distance that's equal to 2/3 miles.
So we just remember that distance is always going to be equal to rate times time.
So our distance is 2/3 miles.
"That's going to be equal to our rate, 3/8 miles per hour, times our time."
"Or we could divide both sides by 3/8 miles per hour, so if we divide both sides by 3/8 miles per hour, we'll get our time."
So divide by 3/8 miles per hour.
Divide by 3/8 miles per hour.
This cancels out.
"So time, we're going to get time is equal to this."
So we have 2/3 miles.
Let me write it this way.
2/3 miles divided by 3/8 miles per hour.
"Or another way to think of it, that's the same thing as times the inverse, times 8/3 hours per mile."
I just took the inverse of this.
We divided by this.
That's the same thing as multiplying by its inverse.
And we inverted the units as well.
And so we'll see that the units cancel out.
"Mile in the numerator, mile in the denominator."
We're left with hours.
"And so this is equal to 2 times 8 is 16 over 3 times 3, 9, 16/9 hours."
"So like an hour and 7/9, or 1 and 7/9 hours to dig the 2/3 of a mile."
Welcome back.
"Now that we've hopefully, learned a little bit about"
"Newton's law, let's apply them to solve some problems."
"Let's say I have a-- I don't know-- some kind of vehicle, a car, a motorcycle or something."
Twist bubbles of the same about two inch size.
Twist a chain of two pink bubbles.
Twist a gray bubble.
I didn't twist one pink bubble.
OK.
Now we good.
Lock the free end of the seventh gray bubble with the free end of the eighth pink bubble.
Twist the seventh yellow and the eighth gray bubble.
Lock the free end of the seventh yellow and eighth gray bubble in one lock twist.
Twist the eighth yellow and the seventh red bubble.
Lock the free end of the seventh red and eighth yellow bubble in one lock twist.
Twist the eighth red bubble.
Lock the free end of the red eighth bubble between the seventh and the eighth pink bubbles.
It's important to make this connection working in the same direction around the row.
Changing the direction will result in making different shape.
We will talk about it in separate instruction.
Or just explore it on your own.
We have made the base of the cabin.
Here is the top view.
The front view.
The side view.
Here is the bottom view.
We have to fix the bottom a little bit latter.
First we will finish the cabin
"Again, there are various ways to do it."
Let's twist ninth bubble of each color.
And we lock free ends of ninth bubbles in one lock twist.
It is a way to make one of the simplest cabins.
Congratulations.
We have made the crane tower with a cabin.
We can cut off the rest of the balloons.
Or we can use remains of the balloons to decorate the crane tower.
"And finally, the L here stands for Last, which means we multiply the last terms in the two binomials, so b * d."
"And the answer to this multiplication is the sum of all of these, F + O + I + L. So, let's apply this method here to see that we get the same answer that we just found."
Okay.
"So, we still have this product, (x+5y) (3x-y)."
"So, what is F here?"
This is the product of the first terms in the two binomials.
"So, 2x * 3x, which is 6x^2."
And what about O?
I is a product of the outer terms in the two binomials.
"So, 2x * -y, which is -2xy."
And I is the product of the inner terms in the two binomials.
"So, 5y and 3x, which is equal to 15yx."
And L is the product of the last terms in the two binomials.
"So, 5y *, - y, which is -5y^2."
"And therefore, this product is the sum of all of these."
"So, it's 6x^2 - 2xy + 15yx - 5y^2."
"And again, -2xy and 15yx are like terms so we can combine them, which gives us the same answer of 6x^2 + 13xy - 5y^2."
"So, FOlL is a quick way to distributive multiplication of two binomials."
Let's see another example.
Let's multiply these two binomials here.
"Well, we can apply the FOlL method we just saw."
This is equal to the product of the first terms in the two binomials.
"So, 2x * 2x, plus the product of the outer terms in the two binomials, so 2x * one."
"And then, plus the product of the inner terms of the two binomials, so -one * 2x."
"And then, plus the product of the last terms in the two binomials, so -one - one which gives us, 4x^2 + 2x - 2x - one."
"And notice the outer and the inner terms will cancel, which leaves us with our answer of 4x^2 - one."
"Now, it should be pointed out that these binomials are special and that we're multiplying together the difference and sum of the same two terms."
"We have 2x and 2x, and one and one."
And there's a special formula in this type of case.
"And the formula is that (A-b) (A+b) = A^2 - B^2, because the outer and inner terms will always cancel, which is what we just saw."
"That is, in our case, our A is 2x and our B is one."
"So our answer here is A^2 - B^2 or (2x)^2 - (one)^2, which is this 4x^2 - one."
There is no problem to convert it back to the flat base.
Use a permanent black marker to draw the face.
You can do it on front side of the base or front side of the cabin.
"Two eyes, nose, big smile."
Simple drawing.
OK.
I am going to cut off funny tails from the top of the crane tower.
It would make the sculpture simpler and our crane more recognizable.
Here is the crane with one funny tail on the top.
Instead of funny tails on the top of the crane.
I am going to twist soft about one inch bubble.
Lock both ends of this bubble in one lock twist.
Cut off the rest of the balloon.
This bubble covers all the knots we have made on the top.
"Congratulations, we have made the crane."
In this instruction we used different color balloons to make the crane.
Here is an example of a crane tower made of four green balloons.
You may notice some minor differences in this sculpture.
The crane's arm has extra bubble.
The cabin is different as well.
I added extra row bubbles to the green tower and the green cabin.
Here is the side view.
Here is the top view.
The front view.
Usually I don't use black marker to make any drawings on dark color balloons.
It is just wasting of your time.
Let me show it to you.
Black is hardly visible on a dark background.
"Anyway, let's finish the face."
We can use technique described in this instruction to make large scale sculptures or parts of large sculptures.
"For example we can use it to make a torso, a leg, an arm, a cake, a vase, a hat and so on."
Have fun and happy twisting :)

"For the owner of a call option with a $50 strike price, then the payoff at expiration ... we're talking about the value of that position."
"If the stock is below $50 we wouldn't exercise it, because we can buy it for cheaper than the option that the call option is giving us."
If the stock goes above $50 we would exercise our option to buy at $50.
"Say the stock is at $60 the underline stock is at $60 on that date at the expiration date, then we would exercise our option to buy at $50 and sell at $60 and make $10."
We would essentially get this upside above $50 on the stock.
"If we think about ... this is the actual value of the position, if we want to factor in how much we paid for the option, we would shift this down by $10."
As the holder we would pay $10 for that.
It would look this this.
We would essentially ... if we don't exercise the option we loose the amount of money that was a loss that we have to pay for the option.
"Then above that we break even at $60 dollars, and then we make money above that."
What does it say to do?
It says check to see if I'm in that base case.
It's the list of length less than two.
Is it one basically?
"In which case, just return a copy the list."
That's the simple case.
"Otherwise, notice what it says to do."
It's says find the mid-point and split the list in half.
"Copy of the back end, sorry, copy of the left side, copy of the right side."
Run merge sort on those.
"By induction, if it does the right thing, I'm going to get back two lists, and I'm going to then merge them together."
Notice what I'm going to do.
"I'm going to print here the list if we go into it, and print of the when we're done and then just return that."
Merge up here.
There's a little more code there.
I'll let you just grok it but you can see it's basically doing what I did over there.
"Setting up two indices for the two sub-list, it's just walking down, finding the smallest element, putting it into a new list."
"When it gets to the end of one of the lists, it skips to the next part, and only one of these two pieces will get called because only one of them is going to have things leftovers."
It's going to add the other pieces in.
"OK, if you look at that then, let's look at what happened when we ran this."
We started off with a call with that list.
"Ah ha, split it in half."
It's going down the left side of this.
"That got split in half, and that got split in half until"
I got to a list of one.
Here's the first list of size one.
There's the second list of size one.
So I merged them.
"It's now in the right order, and that's coming from right there."
"Having done that, it goes back up and picks the second sub-list, which came from there."
"It's a down to base case, merges it."
"When these two merges are done, we're basically at a stage in that branch where we can now merge those two together, which gives us that, and it goes through the rest of it."

Oshizu offered Katsutoyo that one of her children would serve as a samurai in the future, and she decided to become the human pillar on that condition. Although the castle was completed, Oshizu’s children could not be a samurai because Katsutoyo was transferred elsewhere. Oshizu’s spirit resented this, so it rains a lot every April.

Korean paper

History.
"""Hanji""’s history goes back to 4th century. Koreans started making it after papermaking technique came to Korea from China with Buddhism. After since, Korean paper came to be known as the highest quality paper available in East Asia. During Goryeo period, ""hanji"" flourished with the development of printing technique in Korea. Its best days continued throughout Joseon Dynasty. However, it didn’t last forever. Western’s mass production of paper and Japanese’s oppression on Korean traditional cultures ended golden ages of ""hanji"". Nowadays, Korean paper is considered as a tradition worth preserving and spreading. More people are interested in arts and crafts of ""hanji"", and there it has become the part of the tourism for foreigners, too."
Characteristic.
"""Hanji"" is made out of inner bark of mulberry, a tree native to Korea. The inner bark of the mulberry is so strong and durable that it does not decay in water up to a year. Korean paper’s durability comes from this tree. The life span of Korean paper is 1,000 years. For example, ""Mugujeonggwang Daedaranigyeong,"" the world's oldest woodblock print was created in 751. Also, thanks to its durability, Koreans even used it as body armor in war. 1 year old trees are used to make the high-quality ""hanji"", and older trees are used for cheaper modern papers."
Usage.
"There are several kinds of mulberry trees in Korea. They grow in different climate conditions. Each kind of mulberry tree produces different kinds of hanji, and they are all used in a different way. There are various kinds of Korean paper, and they are named after their usage. ""Changhoji"", for instance, is a kind of Korean paper. ""Changhoji"" means window paper. Koreans used to glue ""changhoji"" on a door because it allows both air and light through it, thanks to its wide fiber. There are other kinds of ""hanji"" as well. When Korean paper is used as a copy paper, it is called ""bogsaji"". It is used as paper for family registry book or Buddhist scriptures. When the Four Gracious Plants (plum, orchid, chrysanthemum and bamboo) or birds are drawn on ""hanji"", it's called ""hwasunji"", the drawing paper. Nowadays, Korean paper is used for arts and crafts."

Notes
"Ripley, Derbyshire"
Ripley is a town in the English county of Derbyshire.
Earliest history.
"Ripley existed in 1086 when it was held by a man called Levenot. In 1251 Henry III said there could be a weekly market here and two annual fairs. In 1291 there were ""two water-mills with fish ponds"" in Ripley."
Industry.
The Ripley area has been industrialized since the late 18th century.
"One of the earliest companies to take advantage of mineral resources around Ripley was the Butterley Company in 1790. One of the early, and most well known, examples of the work of the company includes the graceful arched roof of St. Pancras Station in London, recently restored as an international rail terminal. A recent Butterley achievement was the design and construction of the Falkirk Wheel which lifts large canal boats."
Shadwell DLR station
"Shadwell DLR station on the Docklands Light Railway is between the termini of Bank and Tower Gateway to the west and Limehouse to the east. It stands on a viaduct shared with National Rail trains (on the c2c line to Essex), with a single island platform accessed by stairs and a passenger lift (via the entrance on Watney Street). It opened on 31 August 1987 as part of the first tranche of DLR stations. The 1991 Bank extension joins the main DLR line just west of Shadwell."
Wide receiver
"A wide receiver (or WR, wideout) is an American football player whose main duty is to catch the football when it is thrown by the quarterback."
"Wide receivers may also block, run with the football and sometimes throw the football besides just catching it. They can wear jersey numbers 10-19 and 80-89 in the National Football League, but there are no limits in college football."
Universal Studios Japan
"Universal Studios Japan is one of four Universal Studios theme parks. It is in Osaka, Japan. The park opened on March 31, 2001."
Gap year
"A gap year is time taken between completing secondary school and going to a university or college or also between college and graduate school or a profession. It is generally a practice of young people from Australia, Poland, Scandinavia, United Kingdom and United States. The time between the two events is often, but not always, a year. It is often used to travel or to gain experience with an internship at the lowest cost possible."
Beam bridge
"A beam bridge is a strong, horizontal structure that rests on two end supports, and carries traffic by acting as a beam."
"Beam bridges are often used for heavy cars and trains to pass, and some are also built for people to walk on. Beam bridges used to be made from wood and were called ""log bridges"". Modern ones are mostly made of steel. Beam bridges are usually placed over highways, rivers or gaps in the earth so people or cars can cross over them. Beam bridges are simple but they cannot be as long as more complex and expensive kinds. Beam bridges can be connected to make one longer bridge."
Gene Simmons
"Gene Simmons (born August 25, 1949 in Haifa, Israel) is an Israeli-American hard rock bass guitarist and singer for the hard rock band Kiss."

Allied invasion of Italy
The Allied invasion of Italy was the invasion of mainland Italy by the Allies during World War II. The Allies landed on the mainland on 3 September 1943. The invasion followed the successful invasion of Sicily during the Italian Campaign.
The invasion was done by General Harold Alexander's 15th Army Group. This included Lieutenant General Mark Clark's U.S. Fifth Army and General Bernard Montgomery's British Eighth Army.
"The main invasion force landed near Salerno on the western coast in ""Operation Avalanche"". Two other attacks were done in Calabria (Operation Baytown) and Taranto (Operation Slapstick)."
Allied plan.
"Following the defeat of the Axis Powers in North Africa, there was disagreement between the Allies as to what to do next. Winston Churchill wanted to invade Italy."
"When they realized that no invasion could be done in 1943, they decided to invade Sicily. The Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943 was successful. Many of the Axis forces managed to avoid capture and escape to the mainland. Benito Mussolini was removed as head of the Italian government. ""Operation Baytown"" was the plan in which Eighth Army would land near the tip of Calabria on 3 September 1943. The Allies sent the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment to airfields near Rome."
"The main landings (""Operation Avalanche"") were on 9 September. The main force would land near Salerno on the western coast. The ""Avalanche"" plan was for the Fifth Army to land. On the German side, Albert Kesselring realized he could not stop the Salerno landing."
Battle.
"On 3 September 1943, British Eighth Army's XIII Corps launched ""Operation Baytown"". Italian troops surrendered. On 4 September, 5 Division reached Bagnara. Progress was slow as blown up bridges, roadblocks and mines delayed Eighth Army. Heinrich von Vietinghoff's 10th Army was ready to attack the Allied landings. On 8 September (before the main invasion), the surrender of Italy to the Allies was announced. Italian troops stopped fighting and the Navy sailed to Allied ports to surrender. The German forces in Italy moved into important defensive positions. ""Operation Slapstick"" started on 9 September."
"""Operation Avalanche"" was the main invasion at Salerno by the U.S. 5th Army. It began on 9 September 1943. Major General Rudolf Sieckenius commander of 16th Panzer Division had organised his forces into four groups. By the end of the first day the 5th Army had made a good start. X Corps' two divisions had moved between inland."
"For the next three days, the Allies fought to get more beach territory. The Germans defended. By 12 September, X Corps had taken a defensive position. On 13 September, the Germans launched their attack. The Herman Göring battle groups attacked the northern part of the beach. The main attack was between the two Allied Corps. On 15 September 16th Panzer Division and 29th Panzergrenadier Division took up defensive positions. On 15 September, Kesselring said the attack by XIV Panzer Corps must be successful. If this failed, Tenth Army must pull back from the battle."
"On 14 September, the Allies advanced. By 16 September 5th, the Infantry Division had reached Sapri. The Germans decided to pull out of the battle. They withdrew on 18/19 September."
"The Salerno battle was where the Salerno Mutiny happened. About 500 men of the British X Corps refused to join new units. Eventually the corps commander, McCreery, got about half of the men to follow their orders. The rest were court-martialled."
Triathlon
"A triathlon is a sport that consists of three different events one after another without resting in between. Usually, they are swimming, cycling, and running. Triathlon has been in the Olympic Games since 2000. One of the hardest and most famous triathlons is the Ironman Triathlon, which involves swimming two miles, biking a hundred miles, and then running a marathon."
Continuous function
"A mathematical function is called continuous if, roughly said, a ""small change"" in the input only causes a ""small change"" in the output. If this is not the case, the function is discontinuous. Functions defined on the real numbers, with one input and one output variable, will show as an ""uninterrupted line (or curve)"". They can be drawn ""without lifting the pen off of the page"". The definition given above was made by Augustin-Louis Cauchy."
"Karl Weierstraß gave another definition of continuity: Imagine a function ""f"", defined on the real numbers. At the point formula_1 the function will have the value formula_2. If the function is continuous at formula_1, then for every value of formula_4 no matter how small it is, there is a value of formula_5, so that formula_6, means that formula_7. We can put this another way, given a point close to formula_1 (called x), the ""absolute value"" of the difference between the two values of the function can be made increasingly small, if the point x is ""close enough"" to formula_1."
"There are also special forms of continuous, such as ""Lipschitz-continuous"". A function is Lipschitz-continuous if there is a formula_10 with formula_11 for all x,y ∈ (a,b)."
"A basic way to know if a function is continuous is to use a pencil or your finger. Then, start at the left of the function. Then, move your finger along the path of the function. If you ever need to lift your finger or pencil to keep following the function, then you know it is not continuous. This is because, by lifting your finger, you have ""jumped"" from one section of the function to another. That means you made a very small movement but the function changed very much. This is what the first sentence of this article is talking about."

The Great Sandy Desert is to the northwest, the Tanami Desert is to the northeast, and the Gibson Desert is to the south. There are hundreds of salt lakes along this border area, and Lake Mackay is the largest. It has a surface area of , and is about long from east to west and north to south. It is the second-largest lake in Australia."
"The lake was named after the first European to visit it, Donald George Mackay. The lake is most often dry, because of quick evaporation. Salt and other minerals float on the surface."
"Lake Mackay is a central place in dreamtime stories for several Aboriginal groups, especially the Pintupi. The lake forms the centre of the Pintupi ancestral lands. Many sacred paths and tracks come together at the shores of the lake. According to mythology, the lake was formed after a fierce bushfire that ruined the land around it."

"Kintore was founded in 1981. Many Pintupi people who lived in the community of Papunya (to the east) decided to move back to their own country. They had been forced to leave these lands decades before because of weapons testing at Woomera in South Australia. Kintore is a major centre for the Western Desert art movement, which began at Papunya during the 1970s. The paintings made here are visual descriptions of dreamtime stories. They have gained fame around the world. A number of members of the Aboriginal art school Papunya Tula live at Kintore."

Abduction (logic)
"Abduction is the kind of practical logic which answers questions of the type ""how did this come about?"". It produces answers which are not guaranteed to be correct. Consider the observation that the lawn is wet in the morning. How did that happen? In London, the answer is most often that it rained. But in Los Angeles it is much more likely that someone left the sprinkler on."
"Abduction is logical inference which goes from an observation to a theory which accounts for the observation. It makes the simplest and most likely explanation. In abductive reasoning, unlike in deductive reasoning, the premises do not guarantee the conclusion. Abductive reasoning is ""inference to the best explanation""."
The philosopher (1839–1914) introduced abduction into modern logic.
Linezolid
"Linezolid is an antibiotic. It can heal serious infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria that other antibiotics are do not heal. Linezolid is active against most Gram-positive bacteria which cause disease, like streptococci and MRSA. It is mainly used to treat infections of the skin and pneumonia."
"It is relatively safe to take linezolid for short periods. It can be used in people of all ages and in people with liver disease or poor kidney function. Common harmful effects of short-term use include headache, diarrhea, and nausea. Long-term use, however, has been associated with more serious harmful effects."

Hypoglycemia
"Hypoglycemia is when the level of blood sugar is lower than normal. A normal blood sugar level is about 70 to 100 milligrams per deciliter. All of the cells in the body need sugar to do their jobs and to survive. When a person does not have enough blood sugar, their body cannot work normally."
"Hypoglycemia can cause many symptoms. Some common symptoms are nausea, feeling hungry, sweating, feeling sad, and heart palpitations (feeling the heart pounding). Bad hypoglycemia can make a person act like they are drunk or have taken drugs. Very bad hypoglycemia can look like a stroke."
"Hypoglycemia can happen to anyone, at any age, but it usually happens in people who are diabetic. It is often a complication of treatment for diabetes with insulin or oral medications."
"Hypoglycemia is treated by returning the blood sugar levels back to normal. Often, a hypoglycemic person can bring their blood sugar levels back up by eating. In the worst cases, when the blood sugar is very low, hypoglycemia is treated by giving sugar water intravenously (through a needle placed into a vein). In some cases, the liver is able to handle the issue by making glucose."
"The brain and other parts of the body cannot work without sugar. Because of this, severe (very bad) hypoglycemia can cause serious medical problems (like seizures) or even death if it is not treated quickly enough."

Schulze method
"The Schulze method is a way of voting that is used to fill a single vacant position in an election. It was developed in 1997 by Markus Schulze. It is also known as Schwartz Sequential Dropping (SSD), Cloneproof Schwartz Sequential Dropping (CSSD), Beatpath Method, Beatpath Winner, Path Voting, and Path Winner. It is used by several organizations including Wikimedia, Debian, Gentoo, BerryTube, and the KDE."
How it works.
"Voters rank the candidates in the order from the one that they most want to win to the one they least want to win. The same preference (how much the voters want the candidate to win or lose) can be given to more than one candidate, and candidates can be given no number (they are interpreted as the worst)."
"Next, for every pair of two candidates, the two are compared: ignoring all other candidates, which of the two in the pair is preferred by most voters? How many voters agree with the majority decision is noted."
"More calculations take place. Given two candidates A and K, A is said to beat K with strength ""t"" if ""t"" voters prefer A to B, ""t"" voters prefer B to C, and so on, and ""t"" voters prefer J to K. The winner W is the candidate which beats any other candidate X with strength ""t"", but X does not beat W with strength ""t""."

Plot.
"The movie begins with the protagonist John Oldman packing up his belongings onto his truck. John Oldman is getting ready to move to a different place to live. This is when his friends come over to give him a farewell party. From their conversations it becomes evident that John Oldman and his friends are all professors in a university. After a bit of conversation, the group of friends moves into John Oldman’s house. John’s friends keep asking why he decided to “run off” so quickly. John Oldman does not answer clearly at first, but gradually becomes drawn to telling his friends what is really on his mind. He begins to tell his friends about who he really is, a 14,000 year old Cro-Magnon caveman who has survived until the present. His friends aren’t convinced, but rather constantly question John Oldman in order to prove him wrong. The talk goes on as John Oldman’s friends try to prove him wrong, in biological, historical, and religious terms."
The conversations are driven by John Oldman’s claims of his past. His claims include the following:

"A featherfoot is so named because they are believed to have supernatural powers, including the ability to fly and move inter-dimensionaly when threatened as means of escape. He wears special shoes made of feathers (usually emu) and hair, stuck together with human blood. Scholars say that the shoes leave no tracks (footprints)."
"South-West of Western Australia, which includes the Noongar people, have a local scary story to tell at night. When the featherfoot is hunting you, it waits till you’re alone or in a small group, at night walking to a destination. The person or the group will start to get a sense of foreboding, followed by a strong sense they are being followed. The featherfoot is close behind, following. Its steps are silent and leave not tracks. The only way to survive a feathfoot attack is to never look behind you until you get back to a light source. Keep walking and don’t look back, it’s when the person looks behind them, is when it attacks. Often the reason the spirit will follow and attack someone is because they have committed a crime, or something as heinous or evil."
"All that is left behind after an attack, is a single large unknown bird feather and a small amount of the victims blood."

"The most common sticky note is the Post-it, which is made by a company called 3M. In 1974 a man named Arthur Fry came up with the idea for the sticky note. He used a glue that was originally too weak to be used for anything else, so the notes would come off easy. 3M started to sell Post-Its in 1980."
"In 2001, the patent for the glue that 3M uses on Post-it notes expired, so many other companies now make similar sticky notes."

"where ""p""i is the ""i""-th prime number, and"
"Basically, they proved that if a number is superabundant, the exponent of a larger prime number is never bigger than a smaller prime number during prime decomposition(the process of a composite number become smaller prime numbers). All primes from 0 to formula_4 are also factors of ""n"". The equation says that a superabundant number has to be an even integer. It also is a multiple of the ""k""-th primorial formula_5"

Eye liner may also have been worn to protect the wearer from the evil eye. The characteristic of having heavily lined eyes has been frequently shown in ancient Egyptian art. They produced eye liner with a variety of materials, including copper ore and antimony. Ancient Egyptian kohl contained galena, which was imported from nearby regions in the Land of Punt, Coptos and Western Asia."
"In the 1960s, liquid eye liner was used to create thick black and white lines around the eyes in the make-up fashion associated with designers like Mary Quant.

"Each of these acronyms means roughly the same thing. In each, the learners already have another native or ""mother"" language, and they want to learn English as well."
History.
"The teaching of English as a second language has a long history. For example, the official introduction of English into India's education system began in 1835."
Use.
"English as a second language is the single most popular subject in the world, after mathematics. English is a very important language in business. Many people study English as a foreign language, because they want a better job. English is also very important in education. Many pages on the internet are in English."
"Many people who can not go to English language classes study on the internet, using websites like BBC Learning English."
"Many people study English in a country where the people speak English. This way, many students learn to listen and speak English better."
Testing.
There are many English exams. These English exams are important for learners. They may show how well a person can use English. It is very difficult to compare different English exams. Every exam is a little different. Read Testing English as a foreign language for more information.
Global Scale of English.

"Switzerland is known for its neutrality. A country is neutral when it does not take sides among the countries who are at war. Switzerland has been neutral since 1815. Many international organizations are in Switzerland. The United Nations has a main office (but not its headquarters) in Geneva. Its predecessor organization, the League of Nations, was headquartered in Geneva. It is no longer neutral since February 28, 2022."

John Singer Sargent
"John Singer Sargent (January 12, 1856 – April 14, 1925) was an American artist. He was the leading portrait painter of his day."
"During his career, he created about 900 oil paintings and more than 2,000 watercolors, as well as many sketches and charcoal drawings. He travelled worldwide. His parents were American, but he was trained in Paris, and then moved to London."
"His ""Portrait of Madame X"" resulted in scandal, though today it is hard to see why. She was thought to be somewhat loose sexually. In the original portrait as exhibited, one strap of her gown had fallen down her right shoulder. This suggested to some the possibility of further revelation; ""One more struggle"", wrote a critic in ""Le Figaro"", ""and the lady will be free""."
"Sargent visited Spain, studied Velázquez, and was entranced with Spanish music and dance. He understood what the Impressionists were doing, and adopted their habit of painting ""en plein-air"". He was a big fan of Monet, and bought four of his works. His portrait of Monet shows he understood what was going on in French art at the time."
"Sergent kept his American citizenship, and went back there four times. However, he remained living in London to the end of his life."

Classes are mainly in French language. The school has 350 students from a dozen countries. Most of the graduate engineer students live in dedicated housing buildings.
Research labs.
Research at the school relate to the following topics:
Two-body problem
"The two-body problem is a problem from classical mechanics: there are two bodies which influence each other. Very often they attract or repel each other. In many cases they rotate. The problem uses bodies which are circles, or spheres. Solving the problem is possible for many situations, but it usually involves higher level mathematics."
Simplification: One body has a mass that is much smaller.
"When one of the two bodies has a mass that is much smaller, the influence of this smaller body on the larger one is very small, and can be disregarded. In such a case, the problem can be reformulated as a one-centre problem, where there is a stationary big body in the centre, and a small body orbiting around the big one. This setting is very comon. Johannes Kepler was the first person to formulate and solve it. For this reason, it is also known as Kepler problem."
General solution for the two-body problem.
"This cross is a symbol of hope over death, and of victory in returning to life. (See Philippians 2:8-9)"
Other uses.
"The non-Christian religion of Scientology, also uses the Latin cross (but with a star in the middle) as its symbol."
Martin Luther King Jr. Day
"Martin Luther King, Jr. Day is a US Federal Holiday. It commemorates civil rights activist Martin Luther King, Jr.'s birthday. It is celebrated on the third Monday in January and is one of only four United States Federal holidays to honor an individual person."
"President Ronald Reagan signed a bill, proposed by Representative Katie Hall of Indiana, to create a federal holiday honoring King. The holiday was observed for the first time on January 20, 1986. It is observed on the third Monday of January."
Washington's Birthday
"Presidents' Day, originally was two separate observances, Abraham Lincoln's birthday, which was February 12, and George Washington's birthday, which was February 22. The two observances were combined in 1971 into a single observance which is held on the third Monday in February."
Memorial Day
"Memorial Day is a national holiday in the United States. It is also a state holiday in many states. The holiday honors troops who have died in past wars like World War I and the Korean War. It was founded by U.S. Army General John A. Logan, who fought in the Civil War and the Mexican–American War."
"Memorial Day was first held in 1865 after the American Civil War. It was called Decoration Day at that time. The holiday was first called Memorial Day in 1882, and became a federal holiday in 1967. On June 28, 1968, the United States Congress made a law that said that the official Memorial Day holiday is May 30, but that Memorial Day was to be observed by federal employees as a paid holiday on the last Monday in May."
Memorial Day is thought of by many Americans as being the start of summer.
Columbus Day
Columbus Day is a holiday celebrating the day Columbus landed on San Salvador. It is celebrated in many countries. This holiday is very controversial because of the way Columbus treated the Native Americans at the time.
Veterans Day
"Veterans Day is the American holiday when people who had served in the military during war-time are remembered and thanked. It is both a federal and a state holiday. The holiday is celebrated on the same day as Armistice Day or Remembrance Day in other countries. These holidays are all November 11. This is the day seen as the end of World War I. The first World War ended on November 11, 1918."
"The holiday was first created as Armistice Day in 1919 by President Woodrow Wilson. Thirty states made it a state holiday that year. It was made a holiday for the entire country in 1938. In June 1, 1954, the name was changed to Veterans Day."
Ralph Vaughan Williams
"Ralph Vaughan Williams (b. Down Ampney, Gloucestershire, 12 October 1872; d. London, 26 August 1958) was the most important English composer of his generation."
Vaughan Williams always pronounced his first name “Rafe” - (“Vaughan” rhymes with “born”). His father was a rector. Ralph was very young when his father died. The family moved to Dorking near London. He went to Charterhouse School and played the viola in the school orchestra. He studied at the University of Cambridge and at the Royal College of Music where Hubert Parry was his teacher.
Early career.
"Vaughan Williams wanted to be a good composer, so he went abroad to study with famous composers like Max Bruch in Berlin and Maurice Ravel in Paris. Yet he knew that he must not simply imitate these composers, so he also studied English folk song. He became good friends with the composer Gustav Holst. The two men always showed one another the music they were writing so that they could help one another by offering criticism."
"In 1910 he wrote a work which became one of his best-known pieces of music: the ""Fantasia on a theme of Thomas Tallis"". The piece is for a string orchestra divided into two sections. It uses a theme by the famous 16th century composer Tallis. He also wrote hymn tunes for the English Hymnal. One of his most popular hymn tunes is the one called ""Sine Nomine"" sung to the words “For all the saints”. Another lovely work is ""The Lark Ascending"". This is a short work for solo violin and orchestra. The violin sounds like a skylark singing in the sky. In 1934 he wrote a short piece for flute, harp and string orchestra called ""Fantasia on Greensleeves"" which is based on the famous English Renaissance tune ""Greensleeves""."
Later works.
"During his long life Vaughan Williams wrote nine symphonies, works for the stage, songs, choral music and chamber music. In 1938 he wrote a famous piece called ""Serenade to Music"" for 16 solo singers and orchestra. It was one of several works he wrote inspired by Shakespeare. The words were from the play ""The Merchant of Venice"". It was written for the 50th anniversary of Sir Henry Wood’s career as a conductor. In 1953 he wrote music for Queen Elizabeth II’s coronation, including a very short and simple motet ""O taste and see"" which has remained very popular with church choirs."
In his old age he became quite deaf. This was because of the noise of gunfire he had been exposed to when he was serving as a stretcher bearer in World War I.

The two ""Peanuts"" specials ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" and ""What Have We Learned, Charlie Brown"", which he directed, were each honored with a Peabody Award."
Equation of state
"In physics, chemistry and thermodynamics, equations of state are used to describe the state a dynamical system is in. . Equations of state are commonly used to describe the state of gases and fluids. In the real world, equations of state are approximations. They can be quite complex to write down, and usually, they are solved using numerical methods."
Variables.
"There are certain variables such as pressure, volume, or temperature, that can be used to describe such a system. So in its simplest form, an equation of state is a function, that takes these dependent variables as input, the state can then be as simple as saying that in its current state, the function has the numerical value zero:"
formula_1
"where p ist the pressure, V is the volume, and T is the temperature."
Ideal gas.
"The simplest of these describes an ideal gas, it is the ideal gas law. This law can also be used to describe the state of real gases, in certain conditions (such as with a low pressure, and high temperature)."

"In 1949, Young bought a house in Omemee, Ontario, near Peterborough. The family's finances would vary with Young's success in selling his stories and he began taking assignments from ""Sports Illustrated."" His first novel ""The Flood"" was published in 1956. Young moved to Pickering, Ontario and spent a year working in public relations for a jet engine company before joining ""The Globe and Mail"" as a daily columnist in 1957 and moving back to Toronto. In 1959, Young met Astrid Mead while on assignment in British Columbia and, soon after, he and his wife separated. Following Young's divorce in 1961, he and Mead were married. They had a daughter, Astrid Young, in 1962."
He was also a host on Hockey Night in Canada until getting on the wrong side of Toronto Maple Leafs co-owner John Bassett. The Leafs threatened HNIC's sponsor and advertising agency until they agreed to fire Young.
Life on the farm.
"In 1967, Young bought a farm near Omemee in Cavan Township and built a house there. In 1969, he asked to be transferred to the ""Globe""'s news bureau in Ottawa. Shortly after arriving in Ottawa, he got into a dispute with his paper over the publication rights to excerpts from a book he had just written with Punch Imlach. The rights had been acquired by the ""Toronto Telegram"", but the ""Globe"" wouldn't allow Young's writing to appear in a competing newspaper. He quit the ""Globe"" and accepted a job offer from Bassett to become sports editor and columnist at the ""Telegram"", moving back to Toronto within weeks of his move to Ottawa. Young remained at the ""Telegram"" until the paper folded in 1971. He then rejoined the ""Globe and Mail"". Young and his second wife separated in 1976, and in the fall of 1977, he moved in with fellow ""Globe"" writer Margaret Hogan. The two married in 1980. At the same time, Young had a falling out with the ""Globe"" over stories critical of Imlach written by Donald Ramsay and quit. He worked with former Toronto Maple Leafs owner Conn Smythe on Smythe's autobiography, which would be published after Smythe's death in November 1980."
"In 1988, Young received the Elmer Ferguson Memorial Award from the Hockey Hall of Fame as selected by the Professional Hockey Writers' Association, and was also inducted into the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame. Young and his wife sold the farm in the late 1980s and moved to Howth, Ireland, a suburb of North Dublin. In 1990, Young received an honorary doctorate from Trent University and donated many of his papers to the university's archives. The Youngs returned to Omemee in 1992 and repurchased their old farm, which Young owned for the rest of his life. Scott Young Public School in Omemee was named in his honour in 1993. His autobiography, ""A Writer's Life"", was published in 1994."
"He and Margaret moved to Kingston, Ontario, in 2004, where he died the following year at the age of 87."

"Scott Young (born October 1, 1967 in Clinton, Massachusetts) is an American retired professional ice hockey right winger."
Scott Young (ice hockey b. 1965)
"Scott Young (born May 26, 1965 in Oakville, Ontario) is a former professional ice hockey player who played in the minor leagues in North America and in Britain's top level leagues."
"A VIPoma (Pronounced ""V I P oma"") (also called Verner Morrison syndrome after the doctors who first noticed it), is a tumor that does not happen a lot (1 per 10,000,000 per year) in the pancreas. VIPoma makes something called vasoactive intestinal peptide, or VIP. It can do bad things to the heart, brain, gut, gallbladder, and more."
Treatment.
Octreotide (a somatostatin analogue) can be used to help symptoms. Surgery is the only thing that will make it go away completely.
2 Esdras
"2 Esdras is the name of a book in many English versions of the Bible. It is a Deuterocanonical book. This means it is a book of the Christian Old Testament that is not part of the Jewish Bible. The original Hebrew version has been lost, but it is known from other languages."
Achlorhydria
"Achlorhydria and hypochlorhydria is when there is very little, or no gastric acid in the stomach. It can come with other medical problems."
Signs.
"The lowering acid level itself can make symptoms similar to gastroesophageal reflux disease, and hinders protein digestion by holding back the enzyme pepsin. Pepsin needs a low gastric PH to become active. Low acid levels in the stomach are also linked with bacteria growing too much, which can stop the body taking in nutrients or vitamins."
Adenoid
"Adenoids (also called pharyngeal tonsils, or nasopharyngeal tonsils) are tissues at the very back of the nose. They are in the part of the nose where is joins the mouth."
In most children they make a soft bump on the top and back section of the nose's air passage.
Taking away adenoids with surgery is called adenoidectomy.
Phlegm
Phlegm (said: flem) is sticky fluid hidden by the mucous membranes of humans and animals.
Mobile home
"A mobile home, or house trailer, is a moving home which can be pulled behind a truck, tractor or strong car on major roads. Some mobile homes have multiple sections, such as with a double-wide trailer, which can be joined together after being pulled onto a lot as separate trailers. Some also have front or back porches which can be joined outside the doors of the house trailer. Mobile homes can also be referred to as simply trailers or caravans."
"Mobile homes are usually left in one location permanently, but they have possibility to move in emergencies or other events."
Konstantin Rokossovsky
"Konstanty Rokossovsky, Polish: ""Konstanty Rokossowski"", (21 December 1896 in Warsaw - 3 August 1968 in Moscow) was a Marshall of the Soviet Union (1944), a marshall of Poland (1949), and twice a Hero of the Soviet Union (1944, 1945)."
"In World War II he commanded an army in the Moscow battle, Bryansk, and Donskoy fronts (in the Stalingrad battle)."
Grand Theft Auto IV
"Grand Theft Auto IV (""Stylized as grand theft auto IV"") is a 2008 action-adventure video game. The game was made by Rockstar North, and was published by Rockstar Games. It is the sixth main game in the Grand Theft Auto series after which was released in 2004, and the eleventh game in the series overall. The game takes place in Liberty City, which was based on New York City. The game can be played on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PC. The Xbox 360 and PS3 versions were released around the world on April 29th 2008."
Gameplay.
"""Grand Theft Auto IV"" has the same basic gameplay from the earlier games in the series. The player can walk, run, swim, climb, jump and use weapons and basic hand-to-hand combat. Players can steal and drive many types of cars, boats, helicopters and motorcycles. Players can explore and choose how they want to play the game. Players can complete missions, but these are not needed to get farther into the game to open content. When the player does a crime and the police see it, they will start to follow the player and try to catch him."
Osamu Tezuka:
",""Manga is virtual. Manga is sentiment. Manga is resistance. Manga is bizarre. Manga is pathos. Manga is destruction. Manga is arrogance. Manga is love. Manga is kitsch. Manga is sense of wonder. Manga is … there is no conclusion yet."""
Shrek 2
"Shrek 2 is a 2004 animated comedy movie and is the second movie in the ""Shrek"" movie series. It was directed by Andrew Adamson, Kelly Asbury and Conrad and stars Mike Myers as Shrek, Eddie Murphy as the Donkey, Cameron Diaz as Fiona, Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots, Julie Andrews as Fiona's mother, Rupert Everett as Prince Charming, John Cleese as Fiona's father and Jennifer Saunders as Fairy Godmother. Like the first movie, this one is a parody of fairy tales. It was followed by ""Shrek the Third""."
Soundtrack.
"Singer and songwriter Adam Duritz from Counting Crows said that his band's song, ""Accidentally in Love"", ""fits into the movie because it's the story of people who fall in love who weren't supposed to fall in love."" Composer James Horner operated the sound of the score on different levels which James said as ""Fun"". His score came out as an Eels song into a romantic scene with Shrek and Fiona, or a funny scene with Donkey. George Bruns did not compose the film score with Horner, due to a conflict."
Automobili Turismo e Sport
"ATS (Automobili Turismo e Sport, which roughly translates in English to ""Tourism and Sports Cars"") was an Italian car maker and briefly, a constructor in Formula One. The team ran in F1 in 1963, and made cars from 1963 to 1965. The company was founded by Carlo Chiti and Giotto Bizzarrini, intended to compete directly with Ferrari."
"The two most well-known cars were the ATS 2500 GT, a sports car, and The Tipo 100, a Formula One car, which was a virtual copy of the Ferrari 156, which was a Formula One car in 1961. Unfortunately, with the cars being frequently withdrawn and technical problems through the season, the F1 team was shut down after 1963. In fact, out of the 10 entries ATS qualified for (Five races, two cars per race), only two cars were classified at the end of the race, albeit very slow, with Giancarlo Baghetti being classified at 23 laps down (23 laps behind the eventual race winner, Jim Clark). By contract, Phil Hill (with no relation to Graham Hill) finished seven laps down."
Alan Douglas Borges de Carvalho
"Alan Douglas Borges de Carvalho (born 10 July 1989 in Barbosa, São Paulo, Brazil) is a Brazilian footballer who plays for the Red Bull Salzburg in the Austrian Bundesliga. His name as a player is simply Alan. He plays as a striker."
"He started his career for Guaraní FC in Campinas, his hometown. At the age of 16 he joined Londrina EC and in 2008 he went to Fluminense Rio de Janeiro. From Fluminense he went to Europe and signed with F.C. Red Bull Salzburg in the Austrian Bundesliga."
Under coach Huub Stevens he played only a few matches. In the era of Ricardo Moniz he became a regular player of the starting team. During the match versus Rapid Vienna in September 2011 he suffered a severe injury. He healed in April 2012.
Framlingham
"Framlingham is a small town in the Suffolk Coastal local government district of Suffolk, England."
"Framlingham Castle is a large hill-top castle found in the town. It has a population of 3,114 at the 2001 census. There used to be a railway station there but it is now closed."
Westerfield
"Westerfield is a small village near Ipswich in Suffolk. It is about two miles north of the centre of Iswich. The village is served by Westerfield railway station on the Ipswich-Lowestoft East Suffolk Line. The village is home to two pubs, as well as the church, shown adjacent."
"The area of the Village south of the railway is inside the borough of Ipswich, although the area North of the railway is inside Suffolk coastal. The railway is around 500 metres from the centre of the village The railway service provides Ipswich, Felixstowe and Woodbridge, and further afield."
"The village holds a Scout fete, and a church fete, each year. These fetes include traditional games, incorporating many locals from in and around the local area."
"The Village used to be home to a local primary school, as well as a small post office. Despite this the village is still home to a nice village hall, that is home to the 1st Westerfield scout group, as well as a Beaver and Cub group."
"Despite this there are speeding issues along Westerfield road, driving through the centre of the village."
Cocculus carolinus
"Cocculus carolinus otherwise known as ""Carolina Coralbead"", ""Redberry Moonseed"" or the ""Carolina snailseed"". It is indigenous to several states along the South to Midwest. It gets its name from the bright red color of the marble like berry that protrudes from the leaves of the plant."
Description.
"The Carolina Coralbead is a deciduous, woody vine that can twines along the trunks of several trees or along the ground. It occurs in timberline areas, rocky woods, glades, fence rows and ponds. Carolina Coralbead can grow 10–12 ft (3–3.6 m) and usually spaced within 3–4 ft (90–120 cm) of one another. If ingested in large amounts, the berry on Cocculus carolinus can be poisonous, but the overall toxicity of its berries do not prove to be fatal. In areas in Little Rock, Arkansas, the Carolina Coralbead is referred to as an invasive weed system which seedlings have been spread by birds. Once a root system has been established, it is hard to remove the plant, so planting in new areas has been a point of concern for this plant. The best ornamental features of the plant are its foliage and its attractive red berries in fall. ""Cocculus carolinus"" can grow in temperatures between from -3.8 °C (25 °F) to -28.8 °C (-20 °F). Its leaves are covered in short hairs and should not be confused with the species ""Smilax bona-nox"",which has tendrils and prickles."
"She joined up in September 1918, two months before the end of the war. She served as a waitress in the officers' mess at RAF Marham and also at Narborough airfield. She was the last living British veteran following the death of Claude Choules."
Later years.
"She was West Norfolk's oldest resident, the second oldest person in Norfolk and one of the 30 oldest people in Britain."
"She had a son and two daughters, as well as four grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren."
"Florence Green died in her sleep two weeks before her 111th birthday in a care home in King's Lynn, Norfolk."
John Babcock
"John Henry Foster ""Jack"" Babcock (July 23, 1900 – February 18, 2010) was the last living Canadian veteran who fought in the First World War. He became an American citizen in 1946."
"Born on July 23, 1900, Mr. John ""Jack"" Babcock grew up on a farm near Kingston, Ontario as part of a family of 13 children. When he was quite young, his father died in a tree-cutting accident. Despite this devastating loss, Mr. Babcock went on to bravely serve his country in the First World War before moving to the United States where he settled in Spokane, Washington."
"He was 15 years old when he joined the 146th Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force in Sydenham (near Kingston), Ontario. A few months later, he arrived in England. He was transferred to reserve battalions and ended up with the Boys Battalion in 1917, waiting until he turned 18 to go to the front lines. The war ended first. Mr. Babcock would later move to the United States, where he served in the United States Army from 1921 to 1924. Mr. Babcock married Dorothy after losing his first wife, Elsie, in the late 1970s."
"Mr. Babcock read voraciously and, in recent years, completed his high school degree via correspondence courses. He had also taken local college courses. He could recite the alphabet backwards without hesitation and spell out his name in Morse code. He enjoyed travelling with his wife and taking daily walks to keep in good shape. He took up flying lessons and became a pilot when he was 65!"
"In April 2008, the Minister of Veterans Affairs awarded Mr. Babcock a Minister of Veterans Affairs Commendation. Later that year, a small ceremony was held in May at Mr. Babcock's home, where his Canadian citizenship was reinstated. Another accolade came in September 2008 when the Royal Canadian Regiment Association honored Mr. Babcock with the honorary title of regimental patriarch. This was the first time the title of regimental patriarch was given in Canada."
Frank Buckles
Frank Woodruff Buckles (born Wood Buckles'; 1 February 1901 – 27 February 2011) was the last living American veteran who fought in World War I.
Early life and career.
"Buckles was born in Bethany, Missouri. He enlisted in the U.S. Army at the beginning of America's involvement in World War I in April 1917. Only 16 years old at the time, Buckles was asked by his recruiter to show a birth certificate. Later Buckles said of that event, ""“I was just 16 and didn’t look a day older. I confess to you that I lied to more than one recruiter. I gave them my solemn word that I was 18, but I’d left my birth certificate back home in the family Bible. They’d take one look at me and laugh and tell me to go home before my mother noticed I was gone. Somehow I got the idea that telling an even bigger whopper was the way to go. So I told the next recruiter that I was 21 and darned if he didn’t sign me up on the spot! I enlisted in the Army on the 14th of August 1917."""""
"Before being accepted into the United States Army, he was turned down by the Marine Corps due to his slight weight."
"In 1917, Buckles was sent to Europe on the RMS Carpathia, which had rescued RMS Titanic survivors five years earlier. During the war Buckles served in England and France, driving ambulances and motorcycles for the Army's 1st Fort Riley Casualty Detachment."
"After the Armistice in 1918, Buckles escorted prisoners of war back to Germany. Following his discharge in 1919, he attended the dedication of the Liberty Memorial in Kansas City, Missouri, in honor of those Americans who died in World War I. While there, he met General John ""Black Jack"" Pershing, commander of all U.S. forces in France during the war."
"In the 1940s Buckles worked for a shipping company in Manila, Philippines. He was captured by the Japanese in 1942 and spent the next three and a half years in the Los Baños prison camp."
"He became malnourished, with a weight below 100 lb, and developed beriberi, yet led his fellow inmates in calisthenics. He was rescued on February 23, 1945."
He died on 27 February 2011 at 110 years old.
Józef Kowalski
"Józef Kowalski (2 February 1900? – 7 December 2013) was the last Polish veteran who served just after World War I, and believed to be the oldest living military veteran in the world, following the death of Gertrude Noone."
He fought in the Polish-Soviet War which was linked to World War I and lasted from 1919 to 1921.
"He lived in Tursk, near Sulęcin, in a care home. He died on 7 December 2013, just 8 weeks and one day before his claimed 114th birthday, and claimed to be the oldest living man for around a half-year after 116-year-old Japaneseman Jiroemon Kimura's death in early-summer of 2013 (although the GRG and the Guinness World Records never verified him as the oldest living man)."
Stanley Lucas
"Stanley Lucas (15 January 1900 - 21 June 2010) was a British supercentenarian. He was the oldest living man in Europe at the time of his death. He was also the third-oldest man in the world. Lucas was born at Morwenstow UK and had two brothers and two sisters. In 1908 his family moved to Marhamchurch where Lucas lived until 1948. Lucas married Ivy Nancekivell in 1926 and took over the family farm. Lucas was a breeder of Devon cattle and Devon longwool sheep and started a dairy farm in the early 1940s. In 1948 he moved to live with his family at Poughill, where he continued to live after Ivy's death in 1963. Lucas was a member of Bude Town Council from 1959 to 1970, as well as vice chairman. His daughter said, ""He has worked hard in his working life and was a teetotaller and non-smoker and since he has been elderly has been well cared for"". He died on 21 June 2010 in Bude, England at the age of 110."
Exponentiation
"In mathematics, exponentiation (power) is an arithmetic operation on numbers. It can be thought of as repeated multiplication, just as multiplication can be thought of as repeated addition."
"In general, given two numbers formula_1 and formula_2, the exponentiation of formula_1 and formula_2 can be written as formula_5, and read as ""formula_1 raised to the power of formula_2"", or ""formula_1 to the formula_2th power"". Other methods of mathematical notation have been used in the past. When the upper index cannot be written, people can write powers using the ^ or ** signs, so that 2^4 or 2**4 means formula_10."
"Here, the number formula_1 is called base, and the number formula_2 is called exponent. For example, in formula_10, 2 is the base and 4 is the exponent."
"To calculate formula_10, one simply multiply 4 copies of 2. So formula_15, and the result is formula_16. The equation could be read out loud as ""2 raised to the power of 4 equals 16."""
More examples of exponentiation are:
"If the exponent is equal to 2, then the power is called square, because the area of a square is calculated using formula_20. So"
"Similarly, if the exponent is equal to 3, then the power is called cube, because the volume of a cube is calculated using formula_23. So"
"If the exponent is equal to -1, then the power is simply the reciprocal of the base. So"
"If the exponent is an integer less than 0, then the power is the reciprocal raised to the opposite exponent. For example:"
"If the exponent is equal to formula_28, then the result of exponentiation is the square root of the base, with formula_29 For example:"
"Similarly, if the exponent is formula_31, then the result is the nth root, where:"
"If the exponent is a rational number formula_33, then the result is the ""q""th root of the base raised to the power of ""p"":"
"In some cases, the exponent may not even be rational. To raise a base ""a"" to an irrational ""x""th power, we use an infinite sequence of rational numbers (""xn""), whose limit is x:"
like this:
There are some rules which make the calculation of exponents easier:
"It is possible to calculate exponentiation of matrices. In this case, the matrix must be square. For example, formula_44."
Commutativity.
"Both addition and multiplication are commutative. For example, 2+3 is the same as 3+2, and 2 · 3 is the same as 3 · 2. Although exponentiation is repeated multiplication, it is not commutative. For example, 2³=8, but 3²=9."
Inverse Operations.
"Addition has one inverse operation: subtraction. Also, multiplication has one inverse operation: division."
But exponentiation has two inverse operations: The root and the logarithm. This is the case because the exponentiation is not commutative. You can see this in this example:
Sega
"is a company that makes video games. In the past, they also made video game consoles. Their main office is in Tokyo, Japan. They also have offices in other continents – for example, North America and Europe. Their most famous video games are the ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" series. Another famous Sega series is ""Streets of Rage""."
Consoles.
Sega Mega Drive / Sega Genesis 1988-2002.
"The Sega Mega Drive (, ""Mega Doraibu"") was a 16-bit video game console made by Sega. It was in market in Japan in (1988), and in Europe and the rest of the world in (1990). In North America, it was called ""Sega Genesis""."
Sega Mega CD / Sega CD 1991-1995.
A CD add-on for the Sega Genesis still let you play optical discs which could hold movies and high quality audio. It was not well received but has a strong base of fans.

Example for different signals at the input coming from a thermometer in the machine:
Communication.
There are basically two ways of communication:
From the machine to the Simatic.
"In the machine, there are sensors. A sensor gives information about different situations in the machine. For example, how fast the motor rotates, what the temperature is or when the current action is completed. All this information is necessary for the program. The sensors give out an electrical signal, each signal goes by wire on an input of the Simatic unit. So the program knows what´s going on in the machine. This is very important, because now the program can perform the next correct step in its sequence. For example, if the temperature of the motor is too high, the program has to know it. Now the program will switch off the motor."
From the Simatic to the machine.
"In the machine, there are actuators. They cause a wanted motion, action or forming. Examples for actuators are a motor, a heater or a light. If the program says that it´s time to switch on the light in the machine, the right output of the Simatic unit will be set. That means that an electrical signal at the output goes by wire to the machine and switches on the light."
The name Simatic.
"The name Simatic is a registered trademark of the company Siemens, since 1958. Simatic connects “Siemens” and “Automatic” in one word."
Product lines.
Siemens developed four different product lines so far:
Used Software.
Every automation system needs a program to control a machine. To create a program you need a software. Siemens created their own software for their products.

Lect
A lect is a specific form of language.
Some examples of lects:
Register (linguistics)
"A register, in linguistics, is the way people use different words, spelling or grammar—talk or write differently—to different people, in different situations. They might be more polite to strangers, for example. Or they will be more respectful to their boss at work."
This chart shows the words or phrases that one would use depending on different registers:
Stratum (linguistics)
"In linguistics, a stratum, or strate, is a language that changes another language or is changed by another language."
"A substratum is the language which is changed, and a superstratum is the language that changes it. An adstratum is two languages changing each other at the same time."
Language transfer
"Language transfer is where a person uses their knowledge of one language when they learn another one. This can help them, but it can also confuse them."

Figurine notation.
"This is algebraic notation with little figurines instead of initial letters for the pieces. Figurine notation is used in print and computer chess. Since it avoids initial letters for pieces, it is more international."
Notation for positions.
"In addition to the Forsyth notation, positions may be recorded in this simple fashion:"
Akiba Rubinstein
"Akiba Rubinstein (Stawiski, Poland, 12 December 1882 – 15 March 1961, Antwerp, Belgium) was a Polish chess Grandmaster in the first part of the 20th century. Around 1910 he was one of the three best players in the world.p346"
Biography.
"Rubinstein was Jewish, and his family planned for him to become a rabbi. However, he did not finish his studies, and chose to devote himself to chess entirely. The decision came in 1903 after he won fifth place at a tournament in Kiev. He learned to play chess when he was 16,&lt;ref name=""H/W""&gt;Hooper D. and Whyld K. 1992. ""The Oxford Companion to Chess"". Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; and played with the strong master Gersz Salwe in Łódź."
"Rubinstein's best period was from 1907 to 1912. It began with his win at Karlovy Vary in 1907, and a shared win at St. Petersburg in the same year. It closed in a string of wins in 1912. He won five consecutive major tournaments that year: San Sebastian, Piešťany, Breslau (the German championship), Warsaw and Vilnius (although none of these events included Lasker or Capablanca).p79 Some believe that he was better than World Champion Emanuel Lasker at this time. Ratings from ""Chessmetrics"" support this conclusion, placing him as world #1 between mid 1912 and mid 1914. Others believe he was not quite so strong as Lasker, and was eclipsed by José Raúl Capablanca after 1911."
"Rubinstein was never given a chance to play Lasker for the world chess championship: he was unable to raise enough money to meet Lasker's financial demands. In the 1909 St. Petersburg tournament, he had tied with Lasker and won his individual encounter with him. However, he had a poor result at St. Petersburg tournament 1914, not reaching the final pool of five players. A match with Lasker was arranged for October 1914, but it never took place because of the outbreak of World War I."
"After the war Rubinstein was still an elite grandmaster, but his results lacked their previous formidable consistency. Nevertheless, he won at Vienna in 1922, ahead of future world champion Alexander Alekhine, and was the leader of the Polish team that won the Chess Olympiad at Hamburg in 1930 with a superb record of thirteen wins and four draws. A year later he won an Olympic silver."
Mental health.
"After 1932 he withdrew from tournament play, mostly because his symptoms of schizophrenia prevented normal life. He suffered from a fear of people and society. He lived then in a sanitorium, and later rejoined his family."
"Rubinstein lived on for almost 30 years afterwards. He left behind no literary works (perhaps because of his mental problems), but a great heritage in his games. During World War II he was placed in an asylum. One account says that when the Nazis eventually arrived to haul the aged Jewish grandmaster from his asylum to the death camps, he was so patently insane that they abandoned the attempt."
Chess heritage.
"He was one of the earliest chess players to take the endgame into account when choosing and playing the opening. He was exceptionally talented in the endgame, particularly in rook endings, where he broke new ground. Silman ranks him as one of the five best endgame players of all time, and a master of rook endgames."
"He originated the Rubinstein System against the Tarrasch variation of the Queen's Gambit declined: 1.d4 d5 2.Nf3 c5 3.c4 e6 4.cxd5 exd5 5.Nc3 Nc6 6.g3 Nf6 7.Bg2 cxd4 8.Nxd4 Qb6 (Rubinstein - Tarrasch, 1912). He is also credited with inventing the Meran variation, which stems from the Slav defence."
"Today, he certainly has no shortage of lines named for him. 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e3. is the Rubinstein variation of the Nimzo-Indian defence."
"The Rubinstein Trap, a trap in the Queen's Gambit declined is named after him because he fell into it twice. One version of the trap runs 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.cxd5 exd5 5.Bg5 Be7 6.e3 0-0 7.Nf3 Nbd7 8.Bd3 c6 10.0-0 Re8 11.Rc1 h6 12. Bf4 Nh5? 13. Nxd5! Now 13...cxd5?? is met by 14.Bc7, winning the queen, while 13...Nxf4 14.Nxf4 leaves White a pawn ahead."

Andes
The Andes are a mountain range along the western coast of South America.
"They stretch over 7,000 km / 4,400 miles from the south of Argentina and Chile to the north of Colombia. They are also found in Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador."
The Amazon river system has its sources in the eastern flanks of the Andes.
"The Andes are the longest exposed mountain range of the world, and the second-highest after the Himalayas. The Andes mountain range is the highest mountain range outside Asia."
"Aconcagua, the highest peak, rises to 6,962 m (22,841 ft) above sea level. The top of Mount Chimborazo in the Ecuadorean Andes is the point on the Earth's surface most distant from its center. Mount Chimborazo is an inactive volcano in Ecuador, which last erupted over a thousand years ago."
Geography.
The Andes has three sections:
"The northern part has two parallel ranges. They are the ""Cordillera Occidental"" (western) and the ""Cordillera Oriental"" (eastern). The term ""cordillera"" comes from the Spanish word meaning 'rope'."
"In Colombia, north to the border with Ecuador, the Andes split in three parallel ranges, western, central and eastern."
"In the north the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (Snowy Mountain Range of Saint Martha) is an isolated mountain range apart from the Andes chain that runs through Colombia. Reaching an altitude of 5,700 metres above sea level just 42 km from the Caribbean coast, the Sierra Nevada is the world's highest coastal range."
The western range of the eastern Cordillia Oriental is the only one which reaches Colombia .
"The Andes range is about wide throughout its length, except in Bolivia where it is wide. The islands of the Dutch Caribbean Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao, which lie in the Caribbean Sea off the coast of Venezuela, represent the submerged tops of the northern edge of the Andes range."
Geology.
The Andes are a Mesozoic–Tertiary orogenic belt of mountains along the Pacific Ring of Fire.
"The Andes are the result of plate tectonics processes, caused by the subduction of oceanic crust beneath the South American continental plate. South America, like North America, has been moving west since the Cretaceous period. Thus the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate formed the Andes. This was caused by the westward movement of South America."
"The formation of the modern Andes began with the events of the Triassic and Jurassic when Pangea begun to break up and several rifts developed. It was during the Cretaceous period that the Andes began to take their present form, by the uplifting, faulting and folding of sedimentary and metamorphic rock of the ancient cratons to the east. The rise of the Andes has not been constant and different regions have had different degrees of tectonic stress, uplift, and weathering."
Climate.
"The climate in the Andes differs depending on which area, the altitude, and how close it is to the sea. The southern section is rainy and cool. The central Andes are dry. The northern Andes are normally rainy and warm, with an average temperature of in Colombia. The climate is known to change very much in rather short distances. Rainforests exist just miles away from the snow covered peak Cotopaxi. The mountains have a large effect on the temperatures of nearby areas. The snow line depends on the location. It is at between 4,500 and 4,800 m (14,800–15,800 ft) in the tropical Ecuadorian, Colombian, Venezuelan, and northern Peruvian Andes, going up to 4,800–5,200 m (15,800–17,060 ft) in the drier mountains of southern Peru south to northern Chile south to about 30°S, then going down to on Aconcagua at 32°S, at 40°S, at 50°S, and only in Tierra del Fuego at 55°S; from 50°S, many of the bigger glaciers go down to sea level."
The Andes of Chile and Argentina can be put in two climatic and glaciological zones; the Dry Andes and the Wet Andes.
Plants.
"Rainforests used to hold much of the northern Andes but are now reduced, especially in the Chocó and inter-Andean valleys of Colombia. Farming, deforestation, illegal crops, and population growth has done this."
"A direct opposite of the humid Andean slopes are the mostly dry Andean slopes in most of western Peru, Chile and Argentina. That area, and many Interandean Valles, normally have deciduous woodland, shrub and xeric (dry) vegetation, up to the mostly lifeless Atacama Desert."
"About 30,000 species of vascular plants live in the Andes. About half of those are endemic to the region: it is a hotspot. The small tree ""Cinchona pubescens"" is a source of quinine used to treat malaria. It is found widely in the Andes as far south as Bolivia. Other important crops that came from the Andes are tobacco and potatoes."
"Johann Georg, Prince von Hohenzollern (""Johann Georg Carl Leopold Eitel-Friedrich Meinrad Maria Hubertus Michael""; 31 July 1932 – 2 March 2016) was a German prince. Through his marriage to Princess Birgitta of Sweden, he was brother-in-law of King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden."
"Prince Johann Georg was the sixth child of Frederick, Prince of Hohenzollern (30 August 1891 – 6 February 1965) and his wife Princess Margarete Karola of Saxony (24 January 1900 – 16 October 1962)."
Goerg died on 2 March 2016 in Munich. He was 83 years old.
Stuart Beck
"Stuart Jay Beck (December 23, 1946 – March 1, 2016) was an American law practitioner and a diplomat for Palau."
Beck was born in Manhattan. He was raised in Brooklyn.
"As a lawyer, Beck helped negotiate the Compact of Free Association, which established Palau as an independent nation in free association with the United States in 1994. He was granted honorary citizenship."
"In 2003, he accepted the job as Palau's first Permanent Representative to the United Nations. He had this job until 2013. In 2013, he was appointed as Palau's first ever United Nations Ambassador for Oceans and Seas."
"Beck died of kidney cancer on March 1, 2016 in Manhattan, at the age of 69."
Wage
A wage is money that is paid by an employer to an employee in exchange for work. The amount may be fixed for each task completed (this is called piece rate); or it may be based on time or other measurable quantity of work done.
"Work for wages is the most common form of work. Because of this, the term ""wage"" sometimes refers to all forms of employee payment. However, a wage is different to a salary or commission. A salary is where the employer pays an arranged amount at regular intervals (such as a week or month) regardless of hours worked or amount of work done. Commission is usually an extra payment based on the performance of the worker or product. Waged employees may also receive ""tips"" paid directly by clients. They will usually not get the same benefits as those paid with a salary, such as annual leave and sick leave."
"Wages are usually paid by the hour. This is called an hourly wage. Wages paid by the day are still common. Wage rates may be influenced by market forces (supply and demand), laws, and tradition. Market forces are perhaps more dominant in the United States, while tradition, social structure and seniority, perhaps play a greater role in Japan. In many countries, laws set a minimum wage that all employers must pay their workers. This means that employers cannot pay workers a lower rate than the minimum wage; however, they can pay them a higher rate. The minimum wage rate is there to protect the working class."
"Wages were paid in the Middle Kingdom of Ancient Egypt, Ancient Greece, and Ancient Rome."
Aubrey McClendon
"Aubrey Kerr McClendon (July 14, 1959 – March 2, 2016) was an American businessman. He was the founder and chief executive officer of American Energy Partners.

McClendon was a part-owner of the Oklahoma City Thunder of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and was part of the ownership that moved the team to Oklahoma City in 2008.
"On March 1, 2016, McClendon was charged by the United States Department of Justice of conspiring ""to rig bids for the purchase of oil and natural gas leases in northwest Oklahoma"". He died the following day in a car crash near Oklahoma City. He was 56 years old."
Dionysian Mysteries
"The Dionysian Mysteries were a ritual of ancient Greece and Rome celebrating Dionysus. The ritual involved intoxicants (like alcohol) and dancing to music to remove inhibitions and social constraints. It gave freedom to those marginalized by Greek society such as women, slaves and foreigners."
Fetty Wap
"Willie Junior Maxwell II (born June 7, 1991), better known as Fetty Wap, is an American rapper and singer. He became famous after his first single ""Trap Queen"", reached number two on the U.S. ""Billboard"" Hot 100 chart in May 2015. This helped Wap secure a record deal with 300 Entertainment.

Career.
2014–2015: Beginnings and first album.
"Fetty Wap's commercial first single, titled ""Trap Queen"", was released in early 2014. He recorded the song in February 2014. However, it did not gain major recognition until mid-November 2014. Since then, it has become a platinum record and has over 130 million plays on SoundCloud. In November 2014, Wap secured a recording contract with 300 Entertainment. The label was founded by Lyor Cohen, Kevin Liles, Roger Gold and Todd Moscowitz, as well as a distribution deal with Atlantic Records. The song ""Trap Queen"" is about a woman dealing and cooking crack cocaine. His first mixtape, ""Fetty Wap: The Mixtape"" was originally set for release in February 2015. It was delayed because he continued to create new songs. In June 2015, Wap was included in ""XXL""'s 2015 Freshman Class."
"On June 29, 2015, Wap released his second single ""679"". The song's accompanying music video premiered on YouTube in May, before being commercially released. 679 had an original version with Monty only and an added verse by Wap. The Remy Boyz Version was removed from the album His next single, ""My Way"", became his second top 10 entry on the ""Billboard"" Hot 100. Later, Drake remixed My Way and created the version that was then played on radio. Afterwards, ""679"" reached the Hot 100 Top 10 at number four."
"During the week of July 26, 2015 to August 1, 2015, Wap matched Billboard marks by prominent rappers Eminem and Lil Wayne. He became the first male rapper with three songs occupying the top 20 spots on the ""Billboard"" Hot 100 chart since Eminem did so in 2013. He also became the first male rapper in four years to have concurrent singles reach the top 10 of the same chart since Lil Wayne did so in 2011. With his fourth single ""Again"", Wap became the first act in the Hot Rap Songs chart's 26-year history to chart his first four entries in the top 10 simultaneously."
"At first Frederick William tried to follow a policy of neutrality in the Napoleonic Wars. But in the end he entered into war in October 1806. On 14 October 1806, at the Battle of Jena-Auerstädt, the French defeated the Prussian army, and it collapsed. The royal family fled to East Prussia, where Emperor Alexander I of Russia (who, rumour has it, had fallen in love with Queen Louise) helped them against Napoleon."
"But Alexander was defeated as well. At Tilsit France made peace with Russia and Prussia. Napoleon dealt with Prussia very harshly, Prussia lost many of its Polish territories, as well as all territory west of the Elbe, and had to pay for French troops that occupied Prussia."
"Although Frederick William himself resigned to Prussia's fate, his ministers set about a reform of Prussia's administration and military."
After Napoleon's defeat in Russia (1813) Frederick William turned against France and signed an alliance with Russia. Prussian troops played a key part in the victories of the allies in 1813 and 1814.
"At the Congress of Vienna, Frederick William's ministers succeeded in securing important territorial increases for Prussia. After the war, Frederick William did not keep the promises he had made in 1813 to supply Prussia with a constitution."
"He died on 7 June 1840. His eldest son, Frederick William IV, succeeded him."
Population growth
"Population growth is the rate at which a population grows or expands. For example, if a population increased from 100 to 110 in a year, then it would have had a population growth of 10% per year."
World population.
"World population has been rising since the end of the Black Death, around the year 1350."
"Population began growing rapidly in the Western world during the industrial revolution. Several factors were notable: the coming of modern agriculture, and the control of epidemic diseases (black death, cholera, typhus). Modern water engineering brought clean water to many large cities. Deaths from world wars, especially WWI, reversed the trend, but only for a while."
"The most significant increase in the world's population has been since the 1950s in Asia and Latin America. Medical advances, and increases in farming, have been the main causes."
"A single example is both astonishing and revealing. Since 1945, half the forests of Indonesia have been replaced with farmland. As late as 1900, Indonesia was still a densely forested country: forests covered 84 percent of the total land area. Deforestation became serious in the 1970s, and has gone faster since then. About 170 million hectares (estimated in 1900) decreased to less than 100 million hectares by the end of the 20th century. In 2008, it was estimated that tropical rainforests in Indonesia would be logged out in a decade. Of the total logging in Indonesia, up to 80% is said to be done illegally."
"Olathe, Kansas"
"Olathe is a city in Johnson County, Kansas, United States. It is also the county seat of Johnson County. In 2010, 125,872 people lived in Olathe. It is the fourth biggest city in Kansas. By 2018, the Census Bureau estimated 139,605 people lived in Olathe."
History.
19th century.
"Olathe was created by Dr. John T. Barton in Spring 1857. He came to the center of Johnson County, Kansas. He later told about his ride to friends: ""...the prairie was covered with verbena and other wild flowers. I kept thinking the land was beautiful and that I should name the town Beautiful."" Purportedly, Barton asked a Shawnee interpreter how to say ""Beautiful"" in his native language. The interpreter responded, ""Olathe."""
"Olathe was incorporated in 1857. It was not the first city in Johnson County. Because it grew very quickly, it became the county seat in October 1859. Growing hatred across the United States about the issue of slavery led to many fights between abolitionist settlers and nearby slave state Missouri. These fights would grow, and they would become a part of the bigger fight known as Bleeding Kansas. When Kansas became a state in 1861, it was a free state. When it became a state, violence stopped. Peace, however, would continue to elude Olathe for many years to come. In 1861 Union officials and local military forces created a military post in the city. It had one company of soldiers, and it had the local militia."
"On September 6, 1862, William Quantrill led guerrilla Confederate soldiers in an attack against Olathe. A half dozen people died, and most of the city was destroyed. Quantrill captured the outpost, and he tried forcing the men to fight for the Confederacy. Kansas militia continued to stay in the Olathe military post for the rest of the Civil War."
"Confederate soldiers would try to attack Olathe two more times. The first time happened on August 20–21, 1863 as Quantrill was going through on his way to Lawrence, Kansas (see Lawrence Massacre). The second raid happened on October 24-5, 1864, when Confederate Major General Sterling Price with 10,000 men went through on their retreat South (see Price's Raid)."
"When the Confederates surrendered, the military post was ended in August 1865."
21st century.
"In 2008, the U.S. Census Bureau said Olathe was the 24th fastest-growing city in the United States. The same year, CNN/Money and ""Money"" magazine said Olathe was #11 on its list of the ""100 Best Cities to Live in the United States."""
"On February 22, 2017, Adam Purinton said racial things and shot at crowded Austins Bar and Grill in southern Olathe. He shot and injured three people. One person died. The victims were Alok Madasani, Srinivas Kuchibhotla, and Ian Grillot. Purinton was later arrested in Clinton, Missouri. He was charged with one count of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted first-degree murder. This shooting got international attention because two of the victims were Indian."
Geography.
"The United States Census Bureau says that the city has a total area of . Of that, is land and is water. Olathe has two public lakes: Lake Olathe and Cedar Lake with ."
Olathe's Black Bob Park is named after Hathawekela Shawnee Chief Black Bob.
Weather.
Olathe has a humid continental climate. It has cold winters and hot summers. Temperatures range from an average high of and low in January to an average high of nearly in July. The temperature reaches an average of 36 days per year and an average of 3 days per year. The minimum temperature falls below freezing (32 °F) on average of 102 days per year. It does not go below very often.
Some people get strep throat more often than others. Removing the tonsils is one way to stop these people from getting strep throat. Getting strep throat three or more times in one year may be a good reason to remove the tonsils. Waiting is also appropriate.
Treatment.
"Strep throat usually lasts a few days without treatment. Treatment with antibiotics will usually make the symptoms go away 16 hours quicker. The main reason for treatment with antibiotics is to reduce the risk of getting a more serious illness. For example, a heart disease known as rheumatic fever or a collection of pus in the throat known as retropharyngeal abscess. Antibiotics work well if given within 9 days of the start of symptoms."
Pain medication.
"Medicine to lessen pain can help with the pain caused by strep throat. These usually include NSAIDs or paracetamol which is also known as acetaminophen. Steroids are also useful, as is viscous lidocaine. Aspirin may be used in adults. It is not good to give aspirin to children because it makes them more likely to get Reye's syndrome."
Antibiotic medicine.
"Penicillin V is the most common antibiotic used in the United States for strep throat. It is popular because it is safe, works well and does not cost much money. Amoxicillin is usually used in Europe. In India, it is more likely for people to get rheumatic fever. Because of this, an injected medicine called benzathine penicillin G is the usual treatment. The antibiotics lower the average length of symptoms. The average length is three to five days. Antibiotics lowers this by about one day. These medicines also reduce the spread of the illness. The medicines are used mostly to try to reduce rare complications. These include rheumatic fever, rashes, or infections. The good effects of antibiotics should be balanced by the possible side effects. Antibiotic treatment may not need to be given to healthy adults who have bad reactions to medication. Antibiotics are used for strep throat more often than would be expected from how serious it is and the speed at which it spreads. The medicine erythromycin (and other medicines, called macrolides) should be used for people who have bad allergies to penicillin. Cephalosporins can be used in people with lesser allergies. Streptococcal infections might also lead to swelling of the kidneys (acute glomerulonephritis). Antibiotics do not reduce the chance of this condition."
Outlook.
"The symptoms of strep throat usually get better, with or without treatment, in about three to five days. Treatment with antibiotics reduces the risk of worse illnesses. They also make it harder to spread the illness. Children may return to school 24 hours after first taking antibiotics."
These very bad problems might be caused by strep throat:
Likelihood.
Strep throat is included in the broader category of sore throat or pharyngitis. About 11 million people get sore throats in the United states each year. Most cases of sore throat are caused by viruses. The bacteria group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus causes 15 to 30 percent of sore throats in children. It causes 5 to 20 percent of sore throats in adults. Cases usually happen in late winter and early spring.

"The stadium name lost most of its value in Chicago after the company sold its local network to Sprint in 2012. During the 2016 MLB season, the White Sox made a new deal with Chicago-based mortgage lender Guaranteed Rate. The stadium name officially changed on November 1 of that year."
Kauffman Stadium
"The Kauffman Stadium is a baseball park in Kansas City, Missouri. The Kansas City Royals play there."
LoanDepot Park
"LoanDepot Park (originally Marlins Park) is a baseball park in the Miami, Florida neighborhood of Little Havana that is home to the Miami Marlins of Major League Baseball. Before LoanDepot Park opened in 2012, the team, then known as the Florida Marlins, played home games at the venue now known as Hard Rock Stadium. LoanDepot Park is located on the former site of the Orange Bowl Stadium."
"On March 31, 2021, the Miami Marlins announced that the team had sold naming rights to Marlins Park to LoanDepot. The name of the baseball park was changed to LoanDepot Park."
Battle of Finnburg
"The Battle of Finnburg was a battle between the Frisians and the Danes. It was mentioned in two early medieval writings, the Finnesburg Fragment and ""Beowulf"". These may describe a real or a completelymythical event."
Story.
"According to the Finnesburg Fragment, the Danish prince Hnaef came with sixty followers to visit and spent the winter at the Finnburg. Finnburg was the fort of his brother-in-law Finn, king of the Frisians. There a fight started between the Frisians and the Danes. A battle took place that lasted for three days. The verses of the story that were found (which is thought to be a small part of the original work) do not explain why the fight started, nor do they give the outcome of the battle."
"In a passage of ""Beowulf"", a bard sings a song about the ending of the battle, here named ""Freswael"". This is the same story as in the Finnesburg Fragment. While in less detail, the ""Beowulf"" episode is complete. Here it is seen that the Frisians won the battle. The Danish prince Hnaef and Finn's son died in the battle. After the fighting, the parties make peace, and the new Danish leader ""Hingest"" (who some have identified as Hengest) is allowed to leave with the surviving Danes."
Moose River Plains Wild Forest
"The Moose River Plains Wild Forest is a forest in Adirondack Park, which is in the Hamilton and Herkimer counties in the U.S. state of New York. It is designated a Wild Forest by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation."
Caspar Wessel
"Caspar Wessel (June 8, 1745 – March 25, 1818) was a Danish-Norwegian mathematician."
"He was born in Jonsrud, Vestby, Akershus, Norway. In 1763, having completed secondary school, he went to Denmark for further studies (since Norway didn't have any university in 1763). In 1778 he got the degree of ""candidatus juris"", which is one law degree. In 1794 he was hired as a surveyor; in 1798, a Royal inspector of Surveying."
"As surveying is related to mathematics, he later studied the geometrical importance of complex numbers. His most important paper, ""Om directionens analytiske betegning"", (""On the Analytical Representation of Direction"") was published in 1799 by the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters. Since it was in Danish, it was not noticed by many people. Later, Jean-Robert Argand and Carl Friedrich Gauss's paper showed the same results."
"One of the more important, but missed ideas shown in Wessel's ""Om directionens analytiske betegning"" was vectors. Wessel's main thing he wanted to show in the paper was not this, but he felt that the concept of numbers, with length and direction would be needed. Wessel's thoughts on addition was: ""Two straight lines are added if we unite them in such a way that the second line begins where the first one ends and then pass a straight line from the first to the last point of the united lines. This line is the sum of the united lines"". Today, the same idea is used when adding vectors."
"His paper was printed in a French translation in 1899. It was released in English in 1999 as ""On the analytic representation of direction"" (ed. J. Lützen et al.)."
"Johan Herman Wessel, Wessel's brother was a famous person in Denmark-Norway."
Global Handwashing Day
Global Handwashing Day is a campaign to encourage people around the world to wash their hands with soap. It takes place on October 15 of each year. The campaign's goal is to raise awareness of handwashing with soap as a key way to prevent diseases with hygiene.
"The holiday was made at the annual World Water Week 2008, which was held in Stockholm from August 17 to 23. Out of this week came the Public Private Partnership for Handwashing (PPPHW). The Global Handwashing Day took place for the first time on October 15, 2008, the date appointed by United Nations General Assembly to go along with the year 2008 as the International Year of Sanitation."
The theme for Global Handwashing Day’s inaugural year was Focus on School Children. The members pledged to get the maximum number of school children handwashing with soap in more than seventy countries.
500 home run club
"In Major League Baseball (MLB), the 500 home run club is a term given to the group of batters who have hit 500 or more regular-season home runs in their careers. On August 11, 1929, Babe Ruth became the first member of the club. Ruth ended his career with 714 home runs. This record stood from 1935 until Hank Aaron broke it in 1974. Aaron's ending career total, 755, stayed the record until Barry Bonds set the current mark of 762 during the 2007 season. Albert Pujols is the most recent to reach 500 home runs; he hit his 500th home run on April 22, 2014. Twenty-six players are members of the 500 home run club."
"Of these 26 players, 14 were right-handed batters, 10 were left-handed, and 2 were switch hitters (meaning they could bat from either side of the plate). The San Francisco Giants are the only franchise to have four players reach 500 home runs while on their roster: Mel Ott while the team was in New York, Willie Mays, Willie McCovey, and most recently Bonds. Four 500 home run club members—Aaron, Mays, Eddie Murray, and Rafael Palmeiro—are also members of the 3,000 hit club. Sheffield's 500th home run was his first career home run with the New York Mets, the first time that a player's 500th home run was also his first with his franchise. Alex Rodriguez, at 32 years and 8 days, was the youngest player to hit 500. Ted Williams, at 41 years and 291 days, was the oldest."
"Being a member of the 500 home run club is sometimes described as a guarantee of entry into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Some believe the milestone has become less meaningful in recent years. Four club members who are now eligible for election to the Hall of Fame—Bonds, Sammy Sosa, Mark McGwire and Palmeiro—have not been elected. Eligibility requires that a player has ""been retired five seasons"" or be dead for at least six months. Some believe the milestone has become less important with the large number of new members; 10 players joined the club from 1999 to 2009. Also, several of these recent members have had ties to performance-enhancing drugs. Some believe that by not electing McGwire to the Hall, the voters were starting a ""guideline"" on how they would treat players from the ""Steroid Era"". Since then, Bonds and Sosa have also failed to earn election. Most recently, Palmeiro became the first club member to be dropped from the Hall of Fame ballot, failing to earn enough votes (5% of votes cast) in the 2014 election to stay on the ballot."
Whittier Daily News
"The Whittier Daily News is the local daily newspaper for Whittier, California. The ""Daily News"" is a member of the Los Angeles Newspaper Group, a division of MediaNews Group. It is also part of the San Gabriel Valley Newspaper Group, along with the ""San Gabriel Valley Tribune"" and the ""Pasadena Star-News""."
"Thomson Newspapers purchased the newspaper in 1982. Thomson sold the ""Daily News"" to William Dean Singleton's MediaNews Group in 1996."
San Gabriel Valley Tribune
"While the movie is widely said to be a classic comedy today, critical reaction was mixed when the movie was first released."
Awards and honors.
"In the scene where Lamarr talks to his band of bad guys, he says, ""You men are only risking your lives, while I am risking an almost-certain Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor!"" Harvey Korman did not, in fact, get an Oscar nomination. The movie did receive three other Academy Awards nominations in 1974: Best Actress in a Supporting Role for Madeline Kahn, Best Film Editing, and Best Music, Original Song. The movie also earned two BAFTA awards nominations, for Best Newcomer (Cleavon Little) and Best Screenplay."
"The movie won the Writers Guild of America Award for ""Best Comedy Written Directly for the Screen"" for writers Mel Brooks, Norman Steinberg, Andrew Bergman, Richard Pryor, and Alan Uger."
"In 2006, ""Blazing Saddles"" was chosen by the Library of Congress for the National Film Registry."
Alexander Rybak
"Alexander Rybak (13 May 1986) is a Belarusian-Norwegian singer, composer and violinist. He was born in Minsk, Belarusian SSR. He moved to Norway when he was four. He is best known for winning the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 with the song ""Fairytale"" for Norway. Rybak went to the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 in Oslo to perform his winning entry from the previous year."
Pika
"A pika is a small mammal related to the hare and the rabbit (lagomorph). Pikas are also known as rock rabbits or coneys. Pikas have short limbs, a round body, an even coat of fur, round ears, and no external tail."
"There are 37 different species of pika. Most pikas live in colder climates, on rocky mountain slopes. Pikas need cold temperatures to live, and can die if exposed to temperatures above . They live in Asia, North America and parts of Eastern Europe. They are active during the day or twilight. Pikas do not hibernate. Because they do not hibernate, during the summer they gather food for winter. They collect hay, which they pile up to dry. They sometimes steal hay from each other. This often results in disputes. Predators, like ferrets, and large birds often use these disputes to catch pikas."
"Pikas are herbivores and eat many kinds of plants, such as grasses, sedges, moss, and lichens."
Pikas in Eurasia often live in family groups and share duties of gathering food and keeping watch. Some species are territorial. Pikas in North America are asocial outside of breeding season.
Pikachu from Pokemon is based off this animal.
Two-source hypothesis
"The Two-source hypothesis is a hypothesis that was made in the 19th century. It tries to explain what is called the synoptic problem in Christian theology. This problem is that certain parts of the gospels of Mark, Matthew and Luke have texts that are very similar. The hypothesis claims that the Gospels of Matthew and Luke were written based on the gospel of Mark, and lost source text, called Q. The Q is for German ""Quelle"", and means source. The lost document was likely a collection of Jesus' sayings, very probably written in Ancient Greek. The hypothesis is widely accepted among Christian scholars."
Problems.
There are two major problems with this hypothesis:
Favicon
A favicon is small image (known as an icon) that is used to identify a website or webpage.
"This type of icon (also known as a favorite icon or favorites icon) is usually a square image that is only 16 pixels in height and 16 pixels in width. However, modern browsers, especially those installed on smartphones, can display bigger favicons that are 32 pixels or 64 pixels in size. And when a favicon is included in a webpage it can be seen next to a browser's address bar, inside a browser's tab or in the browser's Favorites' or Bookmarks' list."
Henry Rollins
"Henry Rollins (born February 13, 1961 in Washington D.C.) is an American singer, writer and actor. After a few wild years in the punk rock band Black Flag, he started his own metal band, the Rollins Band. Rollins is now a solo artist. He often tours in many countries performing spoken-word concerts."
Tay-Sachs disease
Tay-Sachs disease (also called Tray-Sachs syndrome) is a disease that causes problems with the metabolism of fat. Tay-Sachs is caused by a lack of the enzyme Hexosaminidase A.
"Tay-Sachs is a genetic disease. It happens when Chromosome 15 has a genetic problem. The problem is caused by a defective HEXA gene. It is recessive, which means both parents must give the baby the defective gene for the baby to have Tay-Sachs. One in every twenty seven Jewish American has one defective gene and can give Tay-Sachs the defective gene to their child. The disease is very rare. It is most common in Jewish families. There is a blood test to see if a person has the Tay Sachs gene. This blood test has helped reduce the number of babies born with Tay-Sachs. In the 1800’s, there were 60 new cases and in the 21st century there were 5."
"Infants with the Tay-Sachs gene from both parents usually die of pneumonia or other infections during their first four years of life. Some symptoms include: lack of energy, loss of vision and motor skills (paralyzation), and seizures. Tay–Sachs disease is usually first noticed in infants around six months old. They show an abnormally strong response to sudden noises or other stimulus. This is called the ""startle response"". The child may also be listlessness or have muscle stiffness (hypertonia). The disease is classified into several forms, which are based on the age when the neurological symptoms began. There is no known treatment for this disease."
Similar movies.
"""The Magnificent Seven"" was an American movie Western with a similar story. This is called a remake."
"The movie was also adapted into an Japanese anime series in 2004 by GONZO, entitled Samurai 7. The anime series takes a more futuristic and fantasy take at the original story, replacing robots for thieves and bestowing superhuman abilities to the 7 samurais."
Vacuum tube
"A vacuum tube, also called a valve in British English, is an electronic device used in many older model radios, television sets, and amplifiers to control electric current flow. The cathode is heated, as in a light bulb, so it will emit electrons. This is called thermionic emission. The anode is the part that accepts the emitted electrons. The device may have other parts. Vacuum tubes must be hot to work. Most are made of glass, thus are fragile and can break. Vacuum tubes were used in the first computers like the ENIAC, which were large and need much work to continue operating."
History.
"Although the vacuum tube was invented by John Ambrose Fleming in 1904, it was Thomas Edison who discovered the ""Edison effect"" in 1883 which states that electricity does not necessarily need a solid material to move through; it can move through gas or vacuums as well."
"John Ambrose Fleming invented the first vacuum tube, the diode, in 1904. Lee De Forest invented the ""audion"" in 1906 (which was improved by others as the triode in 1908) and used in the first telephone amplifiers. Many other kinds were invented for various purposes."
"The transistor became cheaper in the 1960s and was much smaller, worked on lower voltages, and used less power. In addition, unlike vacuum tubes, they were much less likely to be damaged by being dropped and had extremely long life. Eventually, they were also much cheaper than glass vacuum tubes. At this time, most radios, television sets, and amplifiers began using transistors instead. High powered electronics such as broadcasting transmitters were transistorized more slowly. Television receivers continued using the cathode ray tube until the mid-2000s."
Current uses.
"In the 21st century, vacuum tubes are rarely used in common electronic equipment. Many devices today rely on the transistor over the vacuum tube. Some devices that still use the vacuum tube, however, include:"
Tupac Shakur
"Tupac Amaru Shakur (June 16, 1971 - September 13, 1996) was an American rapper and sometimes actor, also known as 2Pac and Makaveli, who sold many records. Shakur has sold over 75 million albums worldwide as of 2010. Shakur began his career as a roadie, backup dancer, and MC for the alternative hip hop group Digital Underground as ""MC New York"". He eventually branced off as a solo artist. He became a West Coast hip hop icon after the release of his first album, ""2Pacalypse Now"", in 1991."
"He was born in East Harlem, New York. Tupac moved to Baltmore in 1984. Then, he moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1988. Later in his music career, this experience in school becomes his personality of his own music style. He was the son of Afeni Shakur and Billy Garland, who were members of the Black Panther party. His family was struggling with poverty. They moved homes often, sometimes they even had to stay in shelters."
"Tupac was involved in the East Coast-West Coast hip hop feud. On September 7, 1996, Shakur was shot four times by an unknown assailant in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas, Nevada. He died six days later from respiratory failure and cardiopulmonary arrest due to his gunshot injuries he sustained. Since Shakur's death, seven more albums have been released. They have all been certified platinum."
Shakur acted in eight movies.
"He holds the Guinness World Record for the highest selling rap/hip hop artist, selling 165 million worldwide and 43 million in the US alone. Shakur was convicted of assault and sexual assault in separate incidents."
His work of music had very big influences on the Hip-hop/rap industry in the US.
"In 2014, a biographical movie about Tupac was announced. The movie, titled ""All Eyez on Me"", was released on June 16, 2017."
Early life.
"He was born as Lesane Crooks in East Harlem, New York. Crooks was later renamed Tupac Amaru Shakur after Túpac Amaru II, a ruler in Peru. His family later moved to Marin City, California, when Tupac was 17. Tupac went to Baltimore school for Arts, where he found it interesting to read Shakespeare's poems. He got very affected by the beauty of rhyming, choosing the word and expression. He studied poetry, acting, jazz, and ballet."
Music career.
"In 1990, Shakur joined with the Oakland, California-based alternative hip hop group Digital Underground. He appeared on two of the group's albums in 1991, ""This Is an EP Release"" and ""Sons of the P"". Later that year he produced and released his first solo album, 2Pacalypse Now. The album gained him national attention and featured protest content including racism."
"His second album, Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z. was released in 1993. It contained the hit singles ""I Get Around"" and ""Keep Ya Head Up."""
"His third album, Me Against the World was released in 1995. It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. He was incarcerated (in prison) at the time."
"His fourth album, All Eyez on Me (1996), was the last album released during his lifetime. All Eyez on Me included the Billboard Hot 100 number one singles ""How Do U Want It?"" and ""California Love."""
Shakur won the Soul Train Music Award for Best Rap Album in 1996 for ‘Me Against the World’. He received the American Music Award for the Favorite Rap/Hip Hop artist posthumously in 1997.
Several of Shakur's albums were released posthumously. It contained previously recorded material from when he was alive.
Assassination.
"On September 7, 1996, Shakur was shot four times in a drive-by shooting by someone in a Cadillac car at the intersection of Flamingo Road and Koval Lane in Las Vegas, Nevada. He died six days later at the Southern Nevada University Medical Center. His murder is still unsolved."
Pertussis
"Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, is a disease that affects about 300,000 people in the US every year, out of 30–50 million cases per year. There is a vaccine that can prevent it, so most cases of it are in places where people cannot afford, cannot get, or refuse to get the vaccine. However, this vaccine does not work forever. The disease lasts about 6 weeks, and symptoms include vomiting, violent coughing, and other flu-like symptoms. It is called whooping cough for the sound an infected person makes when they cough."
"The disease usually infects younger people, as they are more prone to diseases."
Deity
"A deity is thought to be a powerful spirit that controls events and the nature of things. Deities are also called gods. A female god is often called a goddess. The adjective of deity is ‘divine’. This word comes from the Latin ""deus"" (female: ""dea"")."
"Different religions believe in different deities. Since there are many religions in the world there are many different ideas about how many deities there are, what they are, and what they can do. Followers of many ancient religions and some modern religions believe in many deities, which is called polytheism."
"The two largest religions on earth, Christianity and Islam, believe in only one God, which is called monotheism. Deism is the belief that a deity exists, but that the deity does not very often change or never changes things in the universe. Pantheism is the belief that the universe is the deity, while atheism is the belief that there are no deities."
"In most religions, believers think deities are immortal (cannot die), and have powers far beyond human powers."
Examples.
Some of the deities of different religions are:
Odin
"Odin (Old Norse: ""Óðinn"") is the god of wisdom, poetry, death, divination, and magic in Norse mythology. Son of Borr and the giantess (jötunn) Bestla, Odin is the chief of the Æsir and king of Asgard. He is married to the goddess Frigg, and is father to the gods Thor, Baldr, Höðr, Víðarr, and Váli."
"Known as the All-Father, Odin is often accompanied by two ravens, Huginn and Muninn, along with the wolves Geri and Freki; the god rides into battle atop an eight-legged steed, Sleipnir, and wields the mighty spear Gungnir, which was fashioned for him by the dwarves known as the Sons of Ivaldi and is said to never miss its target."
"A defining feature of Odin is his being one-eyed, a result of him having sacrificed an eye to drink from the Well of Urðr, which granted him an incomprehensible amount of knowledge of the universe. Odin himself often receives counsel from the severed head of the being Mímir, which recites secret knowledge to him. Half of the souls of those slain in battle will be guided by the Valkyries, battle maidens, to Valhalla, Odin's enormous and majestic hall: the other half go to Fólkvangr, Freyja's realm. Odin was known in Old English as Wōden, in Old Saxon as Wōdan, and in Old High German as Wuotan or Wōtan, all of which stem from the reconstructed Proto-Germanic *""wōđanaz""."
"The modern English weekday name Wednesday bears the god’s name. (from Old English ""Wōdnesdæg"", “Wōden’s day”)."
Family.
"Odin is the son of Borr and the jötunn Bestla. He is married to the goddess Frigg, by whom he is the father of the twin gods Baldr and Höðr. With the giantesses Gríðr and Rindr, Odin has two other sons named Víðarr and Váli. His eldest son is Thor, god of thunder, born to him by Jörð, the personification of the Earth."
Qazi Muhammad
"Qazi Muhammad (1893-1947) was the Nationalist and Religious Kurdish leader and the Head of Republic of Mahabad (Republic of Kurdistan), the second modern Kurdish state in the Middle East (after Republic of Ararat). He acted as the president of the Russian backed Republic of Mahabad, in Kurdistan of Iran (Eastern Kurdistan) in 1946. He was also the founder of the Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran. A year later, the Kurdish national movement (Komeley Jiyanewey Kurd) that he helped organize was crushed by Iran's central government. The Iranian military court sentenced him to death, and he was hanged in Chuwarchira Square in the center of city of Mahabad at March 30 1947. Mustafa Barzani, the father of nationalist Kurdish movement in Iraqi Kurdistan (Southern Kurdistan), was the defence minister in his cabinet. One of his sons Ali Qazi is today an active member in the Kurdish movement."
Brine
"Brine is water that has more than 5% salt in it. It is used for preserving food. For this it is much like vinegar or sugar. Brine is also used to transport heat. Adding salt to water lowers the freezing point of the water. The solubility of salt in water depends on temperature. At 15.5°C, a saturated solution of brine can hold 26.4 % salt by weight. At 0°C, it can hold 23.3% salt."
"Brines also have some pharmaceutical properties, which can be used to treat people, especially those with diseases of the skin, allergies and common colds."
Aladdin
"Aladdin is a fictional person from the story ""Aladdin and the Enchanted Lamp"", which is part of the ""Book of One Thousand and One Nights""."
Story.
"The young man Aladdin is told by a sorcerer (magician), who is pretending to be his uncle, to get him an oil lamp from a cave. Aladdin gets the lamp, but the sorcerer tries to trick him. So, Aladdin keeps the lamp for himself. Aladdin learns that inside the lamp there is a djinn. The djinn can fulfill every wish of the lamp's owner. With the djinn's help, Aladdin becomes rich and powerful and marries a princess."
Highwayman were not only just men but woman too.The Soldiers would catch the Highwayman.
Narrative poetry
Narrative poetry is a type of poetry that tells a story. Narrative poems can be short or long. Some are novels or short stories written in verse form. Many older narrative poems were designed to be passed on through generations as a way of recording history.
Bothwell Castle
"Bothwell Castle is a large medieval castle in Scotland. It is sited on a high, steep bank, above a bend in the River Clyde, in South Lanarkshire. It is located between Uddingston and Bothwell, about south-east of Glasgow. The castle was built in the 13th century by the ancestors of Clan Murray. It was built to guard a strategic crossing point of the Clyde. Bothwell played a key role in Scotland's Wars of Independence. It changed hands several times."
Velpur
Velpur is a village in India. It is in the state of Andhra Pradesh in the West Godavari district.
Child labour
"Child labour means that children are forced to work like adults and take part in an economic activity. According to the ILO International Labour Organization the term is applied to people up to age thirteen, or seventeen in case of dangerous work. Only about a fourth of the ILO members have ratified the respective convention, but the age limits are generally accepted."
"When children work like adults, this will deprive them of their childhood: Very often, they cannot attend regular school either. This kind of work is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and harmful."
"Child labour is fundamentally different from casual work done by children, like guarding other children, or helping here and there. Child labour is forbidden in most countries. In some places minor boys and girls work in tea stalls, restaurants, hotels and other small shops. Some work in huge factories like brick factories. The main reason why child labour occurs is poverty."
There are two kinds of work that minors can do:
"In general the second kind of work is usually labelled child labour. Estimates are that up to 350 million children are affected by child labour. Eight million of these are affected by the worst forms of child labour: they are child soldiers, they are forced into child prostitution, they are used for child pornography, they are child slaves, debt bondage or affected by human trafficking."
"Often such cases are known through scandals in the mass media. In that manner, a working child is often seen as a slave, working in a Sweet shop in a third world country, producing textiles, or as one of the street children in South America. The reality is different though: Such shops exist all over the world, also in countries like the United States or Italy. The fact that child labour is involved is often hidden: More than three quarters of this work is done in the sector of agriculture, or it has to do with activities done at home, in the context of the family. If child-slaves exist, they are only a minority. This form of work done by children also existed before industrialisation and globalisation, the two phenomena have made it more visible."
Cash crop
"A cash crop is a crop that is grown to be sold on the market. This is different from a subsistence crop which is grown for the personal use of the farmer, or as food for the farmer's animals."
"There are several different categories of cash crops, for different purposes."
Foods.
"Food crops are grown to be eaten by humans or animals. Since modern agriculture(farming) methods allow farmers to grow much more food than they need to feed themselves and their families, the extra is sold to others."
Some food crops include:
Spices and Herbs.
"Spices and herbs are ingredients added to food in order to make it taste less bland. Spices/herbs do not make up much of a meal but are very flavorful. Since spices/herbs are used in small amounts but can be grown in much larger quantities, the surplus grown is sold as a cash crop."
Some spices/herbs include:
Materials.
"Material crops are plants which have parts that can be used as raw materials to create objects with. Material crops are not eaten, but sold to the market for usage for various purposes."
Some material crops include:
Medicinal/Drug.
"Because they wanted people to trust the vaccine, Pfizer published the study protocols publicly. That means they told everyone exactly how they were testing the virus. This is information that companies usually keep secret so no one can steal their work."
"On November 9, 2020, Pfizer announced that BNT162 was 90% effective at preventing people from catching COVID-19. They asked the FDA to approve the vaccine for emergency use. The company had not yet published the results of the study in a formal scientific paper, so the FDA said they needed time to look at the results for themselves."
The INN (International nonproprietary name) of this vaccine is tozinameran. INNs are a name for a particular vaccine or medicine to be used worldwide.
Adenovirus vaccines.
"The adenovirus is the virus that causes the common cold. It does not harm the human body much. Scientists have used the adenovirus in vaccines for many years against many diseases. Scientists take pieces of dangerous viruses and attach them to adenovirus to then inject the adenovirus into the human body. The human immune system learns to recognize the pieces of dangerous viruses. After, it can fight off the real dangerous viruses if the human is ever exposed to them."
ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca).
"In late April 2020, a team from the University of Oxford said that they had developed a COVID-19 vaccine. The United States National Institutes of Health tested it in rhesus monkeys and it worked. Because they had already been working on a vaccine against a different coronavirus, they had a head start working on one for SARS-CoV-2. They would try to test their vaccine on 6000 people by the end of May 2020, and that their vaccine could be ready for people to use in September 2020."
The team took the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 and put it on an adenovirus. Then they injected that virus into test patients. The idea is that the patients' immune systems will learn to attack the spike protein no matter what virus it is on. This vaccine completed phase I trials and as of July 2020 is entering phase III trials. The vaccine is called ChAdOx1 nCoV-19.
Ad5-nCOV.
"The Chinese company CanSino Biologics is making a viral vector vaccine. This vaccine uses an adenovirus that has the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 on it. Then the immune system learns to recognize the spike protein. As of July 2020, this vaccine is in phase II trials, but the Chinese government gave CanSino Biologics permission to give it to people anyway. They are allowed to give it to people in the Chinese military."
Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.
"The Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine is made from the Johnson &amp; Johnson company. Unlike many vaccines, it doesn't need special, unusual refrigeration."
CoronaVac.
"The company Sinovac in China and Bututan research center in Brazil worked together. This is an inactivated virus vaccine. This means the team took the SARS-CoV-2 virus and changed it to make it harmless. The patient's body learns to recognize the harmless virus and then it can recognize the harmful, wild virus too. The company got permission to start phase III trials on July 3. This virus is called CoronaVac."
Sinopharm vaccine.
The company Sinopharm belongs to the government of China. It is an inactivated virus vaccine.
This vaccine started phase III trials in the middle of July 2020. This vaccine does not have a name.
Bacillus Calmette-Guerin BRACE trial.
"The University of Melbourne and Murdoch Children's Research Institute are studying a vaccine that works against tuberculosis, the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine. It is a live-bacterium vaccine. The patiebt gets dead ""Mycobacterium tuberculosis"" bacteria injected into them while training their immune system to fight it. Over the years, scientists saw that the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine did not only protect people from tuberculosis, but it protected them from other diseases too. The scientists at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute and University of Melbourne are studying the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine to see if it will protect people from COVID-19. Because this vaccine has already been used for other diseases for more than one hundred years, doctors already knew it was safe to use. As of July 2020, this vaccine is in phase III trials to see if it works on COVID-19."
Nasal vaccines.
"Scientists believe a vaccine that doctors spray into the patient's nose would work better than a vaccine injected into the patient's veins. After a nasal vaccine, the body's immune cells look for the virus in the nose and mouth. The nose and mouth are where most people are infected with SARS-CoV-2. Scientists are not sure why this works. As of July 2020, teams in the Netherlands, the United States, and Canada are making nasal vaccines."
Statistics.
"As of January 27th, Israel is currently the leader in percentage of people vaccinated, followed by the USA and then the United Kingdom. Israel has reportedly vaccinated about 20% of it's population, or 2 million people."
"African Americans are less likely to get vaccinated than other Americans, as are people in the Southern United States."
Arthur's Nose
"Arthur's Nose is the popular first book of the book series, written and illustrated by Marc Brown. It was published in 1976. Arthur is an aardvark. The character of Arthur inspired several other picture books and was also made into an animated television series."
"In this first book, Francine the monkey teases Arthur for having a big nose. As a result, Arthur decides to get his nose cut shorter. However, instead, he leaves his nose the same and his friends are happy, except Francine."
Prey Veng province
Prey Veng is a province in Cambodia. The capital city is also named Prey Veng.
It is on the east bank of the Mekong river. The Bassac River is also in the province.
"John of Damascus studied religion. He also studied law, theology, philosophy and music. He is said by some sources to have served as a Chief Administrator to the Muslim caliph of Damascus before he became a priest. He wrote works about Christianity. He composed hymns that are still used by Greek Orthodox churches around the world. He is considered ""the last of the Fathers"" of the Eastern Orthodox church. He is best known for arguing to let people use pictures of Greek Orthodox saints, which are called ""icons"". He is also honored by Catholic churches, specifically the Roman Catholic Church."
Pope Leo IV
Pope Saint Leo IV (790 – 17 July 855) was pope of the Roman Catholic Church from 10 April 847 until he died in 855.
"He was born in Rome. He died in Rome on 17 July 855 and was buried in St. Peter's Basilica. There was a medieval tradition that had claimed that a woman, Pope Joan, had succeeded him by disguising herself as a man but she is believed to be fictitious."
Rosamund Pike
"Rosamund Pike (born 27 January 1979) is an English actress. She became known in the 2002 movie ""Die Another Day"" in which she played the Bond girl and double agent Miranda Frost. She also played Helen in the 2012 melodrama movie ""Jack Reacher"". Her role in ""Gone Girl"" got her an Academy Award nomination. Pike was born in London."
Pope John XV
Pope John XV (??? − March 996) was pope of the Roman Catholic Church from August 985 to his death in 996.
"He was born in Rome, Papal States and died in March 996 in Rome, Papal States, Holy Roman Empire."
"During his time as pope, there was a dispute that arose over the deposition in 991 of Arnulf, Archbishop of Reims. Arnulf was made archbishop of Reims in 988 by Hugh Capet of France. Arnulf was the nephew of the King's bitter rival, Charles of Lorraine and considered Arnulf a turncoat. He demanded his deposition by John XV. Hugh Capet captured both Charles and Archbishop Arnulf and convoked a synod at Reims in June 991. He deposed Arnulf and chose as his successor Abbot Gerbert of Aurillac who would later be known as Pope Silvester II."
"At the synod, Arnulf, Bishop of Orléans accused John XV:"
Die Another Day
"Die Another Day is a 2002 British action thriller spy movie directed by the movie director Lee Tamahori. It is about James Bond going across North Korea trying to get redemption. Pierce Brosnan plays James Bond, Halle Berry plays Bond's ally agent Jinx, and Rosamund Pike plays the double agent Miranda Frost. The movie got negative reviews. The box office of the movie, however, was positive. The movie was released in November 2002. Madonna sings the title song of the movie."
Black Friday
"Black Friday is the day after Thanksgiving in the United States. Even though it falls on a Friday, which is the last day before the weekend, and comes right after Thanksgiving Thursday, it is not a federal holiday. There are some states, however, that observe this day instead of Columbus Day for workers of the state government."
"The name ""Black Friday"" started to be used sometime after World War II, but it was not popular outside of Philadelphia until around 1975"
Traditions.
"Many Americans see Black Friday as the official beginning of the Christmas holiday season, a time when many people go shopping for gifts to give to their family and friends on Christmas Day. On Black Friday, many stores have big sales, and it is common to see long lines of people waiting outside stores and in malls to get the best deals first before they run out. Because of this, stores usually open around 6 am in the morning or later. Some stores, though, started opening at 5 am and even 4 am in the late 20th century. Now, a few stores even open at midnight. Shoppers like to stay out all day to get what they need, making Black Friday the busiest shopping day of the year."
"On the first Monday after the long weekend is Cyber Monday, when many people go online shopping."
Lions in heraldry
"Lions appear in heraldry more often than any other animal. It traditionally symbolises bravery, valour, strength, and royalty."
"They may appear as a charge on the shield or as a crest. They are described in the ""blazon"" (heraldic description) by their ""tincture"" (color) and ""attitude"" (position). Sometimes the teeth and claws of a lion can be colored differently from the rest of its body; it is said to be ""armed"" of that color (e.g. ""A lion Or armed gules"" is a gold lion with red teeth and claws). Sometimes the tail is even described, if it is shown in an unusual way. One reason why lions are shown in so many different ways is because when heraldry developed, a lot of people wanted a lion on their coat of arms, but no two coats of arms can be the same. The purpose of heraldry in the Middle Ages was to identify people with bold images over the outside of their armour. Since a lot of people started putting lions on their coats of arms, they placed them in a lot of different positions and in every color used in heraldry. In France and Germany, they even made patterns of colors on some of their lions, as if they were painted."
"French heralds refer to lions in the walking positions as ""leopards"", but this term is seldom used by British heralds."
Attitudes.
"Although there are many ""attitudes"" or positions now used in heraldry, very few of these were known to medieval heralds, who simply wanted to draw a lion to fill the space provided on the shield. The following table describes the different attitudes of heraldic lions:"
"Other terms are used to describe the lion's position in further detail. The lion's head is normally seen in agreement with the overall position, (facing left) unless otherwise stated. If a lion's ""whole body"" is turned to face right, he is ""to sinister"" or ""contourné"". If his ""whole body"" faces the viewer, he is ""affronté"". If his ""head only"" faces the viewer he is ""guardant"" or ""gardant"", and if he looks back over his shoulder (body facing left but head turned to face right) he is ""regardant"". These words follow the main description of position, and then the lion is further described as ""armed"" (teeth and claws) of another color, if another color is used. And finally, the tail may be described if it is unusual. A lion (or other beast) ""coward"" carries its tail between its hind legs. The tail also may be ""nowed"" (knotted), or the lion may be ""queue fourchée"" (forked tail) or ""double-queued"" (two tails)."
"As President, Roosevelt worked to make the U.S. a world power, one of the most powerful countries in the world. Before, it had been the richest country in the world, but not a significant military power. Roosevelt's foreign policy was described by an African proverb as ""speak softly and carry a big stick"", meaning you do not have to make war, but should give that impression if you are to be respected. He increased the size of the United States' navy and sent all of the ships across the world to demonstrate to other countries that the United States was strong and could fight if needs be."
"He continued the Monroe Doctrine and used the country's military might to influence Latin American politics. He had the Panama Canal built (which allowed ships to travel in less time by taking a shortcut). In doing so, he created the independent country of Panama, which before was part of Colombia, by invading it. He also took a part for the United States, which is where the canal was built. It was not turned over to Panama until 1999. As president, he was interested in what happened in other countries. In 1905, he helped to end the war between the Russian and Japanese empires. Everybody thought Russia would defeat Japan, but the result was the opposite. Roosevelt met both parties and convinced them to sign a peace treaty. He won a Nobel Peace Prize for this work in 1906. He was the first president of any country to win the prize."
"At home, Roosevelt fought for all Americans having a ""Square Deal"", meaning an equal chance for all Americans to become successful. As part of his Square Deal, he regulated big businesses called trusts, and forced several of them to split up in several smaller companies. This should support competition, which he thought was important. Roosevelt supported labor laws for the working class, required meat and drugs to be inspected, and protected the environment. He created several nature reserves. These ideas would influence later presidents to expand the government's role in the economy and to help ordinary workers. Many in the Republican party opposed him because of this, however."
After being president.
"Roosevelt did not run for president in 1908, as he had the office for nearly eight years. He wanted his Solicitor General, William Howard Taft to run for president instead. Taft was chosen, and Roosevelt went to Africa to hunt big game. However, when he came back, he thought Taft was not doing a good job and taking too little actions against so-called trusts. Taft was also more conservative and he did not continue all of Roosevelt's progressive policies. He decided to challenge Taft for the Republican nomination in 1912. He failed, but many Republicans preferred Roosevelt, and instead he launched his own party, the Progressive party. While running for president and holding a speech, he was shot, but lived and even finished his speech. Because the Republican voters split between Roosevelt and Taft, they both lost to Woodrow Wilson. Roosevelt also thought Wilson was not doing a good job, either, and wanted the U.S. to enter World War I after it broke out. He prepared to run again, for the third time, in 1920. Nobody had served more than eight years at the time. Roosevelt died, however, on January 6, 1919 of a pulmonary embolism and a heart attack in his sleep. Because he was so strong, a newspaper commented that ""death had to take Roosevelt asleep"", because if he had been awake there would have been a fight between him and death."
Other Information.
"Besides being president, Roosevelt was an author and historian. He wrote 35 books about politics, ships, and hunting. He is thought to be one of America's presidents who read the most. He owned a large ranch in North Dakota. He also hunted large animals throughout the world and was active with the Boy Scouts of America."
Legacy.
Roosevelt is one of four Presidents to be carved in stone on Mount Rushmore. Historians consider him one of the best U.S. presidents.
Namesake.
"Theodore Roosevelt is the namesake of many American schools. He has a national park in North Dakota named after him, a type of elk (big deer), as well as river in Brazil. The popular stuffed animal doll, the ""Teddy bear"", was named after Roosevelt."
Two US Navy ships are named after him:

Notes
Composer
"A composer is someone who writes (composes) music. Some composers work by writing music down on paper; this is called 'written notation'. Classical music writers work this way. Writers for TV and movie music also usually write this way, so that an orchestra or other players can read the music and play it."
"Some musicians are very good at improvisation. This means that they think up (invent) the music as they play it. Some church organists are good at improvising. During a service they may need to play some organ music to fill in the gaps while people are collecting money or taking communion. Jazz musicians are usually excellent at improvising. Improvisation is not written down, so each time it is different."
Popular and rock or soul music writers are often not able to read and write music down. Many pop and rock composers compose their songs on a guitar or piano. Cole Porter and Irving Berlin usually composed at the piano.
"Many songs are written by two or more people. It is common for two people to work together to write songs. Sometimes, one person writes the music and one writes the words (the lyrics). Some songs such as folk songs were composed many years ago and no one knows who wrote them."
Cannes Film Festival
"The Cannes Film Festival is an event held every year in Cannes, France. The festival previews films from around the world."
Only those who are invited can attend the festival. The top film wins the Palme d'Or. The second most prestigious trophy is the Grand Prix. A jury selects which film earns the prizes. The jury is led by an internationally recognized personality of cinema. Being appointed to this position is the recognition of an outstanding career.

Henry VIII
"Henry VIII (28 June 1491 – 28 January 1547) was the King of England from 1509 until his death in 1547. He is perhaps one of England's most famous monarchs because he split England from the Roman Catholic Church and the Pope, and because he married six times."
"Henry VIII increased the power of the monarchy and government over the country. Many people he did not like were executed under his orders, including two of his own wives. He was easily led by whoever his favourite advisor was: Thomas Wolsey, Thomas More, Thomas Cromwell, Thomas Cranmer and Richard Rich. More and Cromwell were also executed. He passed laws to merge Wales into England and was the first English monarch to be King of Ireland."
Length of time.
"Disputes may last for long periods, and the longer they last, the more damage they may do. Where disputes involve religions, or hostile countries, they may last for more than a lifetime. Generations of children may be taught that their side is completely right, and the other wrong."
Fundamental values.
"Disputes arise when there are conflicting needs, values or ideas. Differences of religion and culture are a common cause of disputes. Self-interest is a common cause of disputes between individuals."
Media spread disputes.
"A second factor is the use of books, newspapers, radio and television by each side to promote their side of the argument. This propaganda helps to continue and spread the dispute."
Laws.
"Laws may prevent freedom of speech, and prevent discussion in print or other media. This makes it difficult for either side to see merit in the other point of view. In turn, this makes it difficult for compromise or tolerance to dissolve the dispute."
How disputes are resolved.
Negotiation.
"The study of disputes and conflicts reached its peak during the Cold War. Then the West versus East conflict seemed to threaten world peace, and many ideas were put forward to use negotiation as a tool to calm the tension. Negotiation about the reduction of nuclear weapons was successful."
"The tension was finally reduced by the unexpected end of the Soviet Union, and the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Eastern Europe. This was not achieved by negotiation. The reasons for the end of the Soviet Union are still being debated."
Mediation.
"Professional help may be available. Between people, there are counsellors; between organisations there are specialists in conflict resolution; between countries there is the United Nations."
Time.
"Some disputes do fade with the passage of time, though the time may be much longer than a human lifetime. Conflict between religions may fade only after centuries, and there is no known process of mediation."
Law.
"All legal systems have provisions for making decisions in disputes. Usually the cases are based on claims about money, between individual people or between 'corporate entities'. These are companies or other organisations. Usually, the law can only be used if it can reach a decision based on evidence. Law textbooks list which disputes which may be addressed by law, and which can not."
Direct action.
"Force has been used many times to enforce one side of the other to submit. Wars have been based on disputes, or disputes have been used as an excuse for wars. However, force has also been used to keep warring groups apart, and calm people down. Both the European Union and the United Nations have used peace-keeping forces in areas under violent dispute."
Education.
"Education may be used to harden opinion and make a dispute worse, or it may be used to open people's minds to unpopular ideas. Education which helps people to think for themselves and keep an open mind is thought to reduce prejudice and conflict."
Democracy.
"Democracy is one way of easing conflict within a country. It is not a perfect solution, for small groups may feel they are permanently excluded from power. Free speech and freedom from censorship exist to some extent in democracies. These freedoms are valuable to minority groups inside a country. Countries that have these freedoms are called open or liberal democracies."
Examples.
"Of course, there are many disputes between individual people, but disputes between large groups or nations are of very great importance."
Seating capacity
"Seating capacity is the highest number of people who can sit in a specific space. This limit can be either from the amount of space available, or from a law saying how many people are allowed to be there at a time."
"Seating capacity can be for different kinds of things. It can be the number of people who can fit in a vehicle, for example an automobile or an airplane. It can also be for a stadium. The largest sports building in the world, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, has a permanent seating capacity of more than 257,000 people. Seats can be added on the field to raise that number to about 400,000."
Apotropaic magic
"Lagrange's treatise on analytical mechanics, first published in 1788, was the best treatment of classical mechanics since Newton, and helped the development of mathematical physics in the nineteenth century."
Life.
"Lagrange's parents were Italian, although he also had French ancestors on his father's side. In 1787, at age 51, he moved from Berlin to France and became a member of the French Academy, and he remained in France until the end of his life. Therefore, Lagrange is alternatively considered a French and an Italian scientist."
Lagrange survived the French Revolution and became the first professor of analysis at the École Polytechnique upon its opening in 1794. Napoleon appointed Lagrange to the Legion of Honour and made him a Count of the Empire in 1808. Lagrange is buried in the Panthéon and his name appears as one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.
Homeless World Cup
"The Homeless World Cup is an football competition for homeless people all over the world. Starting in 2003 in Graz, Austria, the competition brings together homeless people with the aim to end homelessness."
Rules.
"Anyone can play, male or female, as long as they are at least 16 years old. They must also have been homeless at some point after the previous year's World Cup, work as a street newspaper seller to earn money or be asylum seekers."
"A team of 4 players play, with 3 outfield players and 1 goalkeeper. 4 substitution players are allowed."
"A team gets 3 points for a win. If a match ends in a draw, it is decided by penalty shootout and the winning team gets three points and the losing team gets one point. Games are 14 minutes long, in two seven-minute halves. The field is 22m (long) x 16m (wide)."
History.
Since 2003 the competition has taken place in:
"""Kicking It"" documentary."
"The 2006 Homeless World Cup was the filmed as part of a documentary called ""Kicking It"". directed by Susan Koch and Jeff Werner focusing on the experiences of seven homeless people at the Homeless World Cup football (soccer) game. Residents of Afghanistan; Kenya; Dublin, Ireland; Charlotte, North Carolina; Madrid, Spain and St. Petersburg in Russia were in the documentary which was narrated by actor Colin Farrell. The movie was released in January, 2008 at the Sundance Film Festival and is being distributed by Liberation Entertainment, Netflix and ESPN."
I Know What You Did Last Summer
"I Know What You Did Last Summer is a 1997 American teen slasher movie. The movie is based on the novel of the same name by Lois Duncan. The movie was directed by Jim Gillespie. It stars Jennifer Love Hewitt, Freddie Prinze, Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, Matthew Lillard, Neve Campbell and Ryan Phillippe. The writer is Kevin Williamson (the writer of ""Scream""). It was followed by two sequels: ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer"" and ""I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer""."
Plot.
"On the Fourth of July 1996 in Southport, North Carolina, high school graduates Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt), Ray and George Bronson (Freddie Prinze Jr. and Matthew Lillard) Charlotte Wilson (Neve Campbell), Helen Shivers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), and Barry Cox (Ryan Phillippe) drive to the beach after a night of partying. While driving along a coastal byway, they accidentally hit a pedestrian. Julie's friend Max (Johnny Galecki) passes by them on the road. Julie reassures Max that everything is all right, and he leaves. After some arguing, the group decides to dispose of the body, dumping it in the water. They agree to never again discuss what had happened."
"A year later, Julie returns home from her college in Boston for the summer. Since the incident, the friends have gone their separate ways. Julie receives a letter with no return address, stating, ""I know what you did last summer!"" Disturbed, Julie tracks down Helen, who has returned to Southport to work at her family's department store after a failed attempt at an acting career in New York City. The girls take the note to Barry, who immediately suspects Max. They confront Max on the docks, and Barry threatens him with a hook. Julie meets Ray, who is now working as a fisherman; he unsuccessfully tries to reconcile with her. Julie meets up with George, who is now working as a host for a children's TV show, she showed the letter to George, then Julie and George meet up with Charlotte, who now works at a video store. She reconciles with George and Julie. Later, Max is killed by a figure in a rain slicker wielding a hook. Barry discovers a note in his gym locker saying, ""I know."" He is then ambushed by the same assailant driving Barry's car."
"Meanwhile, Julie, Charlotte and George researches newspaper articles which lead them to believe the man they ran over was a local named David Egan. Helen, George, Charlotte and Julie go to visit with David's sister Missy (Anne Heche) at her home. Missy explains to them that their family was devastated by David's death; she also mentions that a friend of David's named Billy Blue also visited her to pay his last respects. Later that night, the killer sneaks into Helen's house, cuts off her hair while she sleeps, and writes ""Soon"" in lipstick on her vanity mirror."
"The following morning, Julie, Charlotte and George find Max's corpse wearing Barry's stolen jacket in the trunk of their car. When Julie calls the others, the body is missing. Julie, Charlotte, George, Helen, and Barry confront Ray about the recent events. Ray claims to have received a threatening letter as well. Julie goes back to visit Missy, while Barry and Helen go to participate in the Fourth of July parade. Missy reveals David allegedly committed suicide out of guilt for the death of his girlfriend Susie in a car accident and shows David's suicide note to Julie and George. As the writing matches that of the note she received, Julie and George realise it was not a suicide note, but a death threat."
"At the Croaker Beauty Pageant, Helen witnesses Barry and Charlotte being murdered on the balcony. She rushes upstairs with a police officer but finds no sign of the killer or Barry or Charlotte. A police officer escorts Helen home, but the killer lures him into an alley and murders him. Helen flees to her nearby family store, where her sister Elsa (Bridgette Wilson) is closing for the night. The killer enters the store and murders Elsa. Helen is chased to the third floor of the building and escapes through a window, falling to a long alleyway. She manages to run toward the street, but the killer stops her and slashes her to death, her screams being drowned out by the sound of the oncoming parade."
"Julie and George find an article mentioning Susie's father, Ben Willis (Muse Watson), and realise that Ben was the man they ran over, moments after he had killed David to avenge his daughter. She and George then go to the docks to tell Ray, but he refuses to believe them. Julie and George notice Ray's boat is called Billy Blue and run away. Ben appears, knocking Ray unconscious, and invites both Julie and George to hide on his boat. On the boat, they find photos and articles about their friends and them, and pictures of Susie. Ben's boat leaves the docks, and he begins tormenting Julie and George, chasing them below deck; there, they uncover the bodies of Helen, Charlotte and Barry in the boat's ice box. Ray regains consciousness and steals a motorboat to rescue Julie and George. He ultimately uses the rigging to sever Ben's hand and send him overboard. When the police question them, they deny knowing why Ben attempted to kill them, but they are relieved not to have actually killed anybody the previous summer, and reconcile."
"A year later, both Julie and George are in college in Boston. As Julie enters the shower, she notices the words ""I still know"" on the mirror. Moments later, a dark figure crashes through it as Julie screams in horror."
Amu Darya
"The Amu Darya (, ""Āmūdaryā""; , ""Jihôn"" or ""Jayhoun""; , ""Gozan"" ), also called Oxus and Amu River, is a major river in Central Asia. It is formed by the junction of the Vakhsh and Panj. In ancient times, the river was regarded as the boundary between Iran and Turan."
Names.
"In antiquity, the river was known as ""Vaksu"" to Indo-Aryans."
"In ancient Afghanistan, the river was also called ""Gozan"", descriptions of which can be found in the book ""The Kingdom of Afghanistan: a historical sketch By George Passman Tate""."
War
"War is a situation or a period of fighting between countries or groups of people. A war generally involves the use of weapons, a military organization and soldiers. War is a situation in which a nation enforces its rights by using force. Not every armed conflict is a war. A fight between individuals, between gangs, drug cartels, etc. is not considered a war. However, most wars are called armed conflicts. International humanitarian law is a set of rules that tries to limit the effects of wars. International Humanitarian Law recognizes two kinds of wars. These are:"
"Karl von Clausewitz wrote in his classic book, ""On War"", that ""war is a mere continuation of policy with other means.” Clausewitz viewed war as a political instrument. His book about military philosophy remains the most influential work on the history and strategy of war. An earlier authority on war was Sun Tzu. In his book ""The Art of War"", Sun Tzu saw war as a necessary evil. It was something people do."
"Wars have been fought to control natural resources, for religious or cultural reasons and over political balances of power. They have been fought over legitimacy (correctness) of particular laws. They have been fought to settle arguments about land or money, and many other issues. The reasons behind any war are often very complex. While a war can start for just about any reason, there is usually more than one cause."
War and the beginning of nations.
"From the earliest times, individual states or political factions have used war to gain sovereignty over regions. In one of the earliest civilizations in history, Mesopotamia, they were in a near constant state of war. Ancient Egypt during its Early Dynastic Period came about by war when Lower and Upper Egypt were joined as one country, about 3100 BC. The Zhou Dynasty ruled Ancient China came to power in 1046 through war. Scipio Africanus (236-183 BCE) defeated Carthage leading Ancient Rome to begin a conquest of the known world. Philip II of Macedon (382-336 BCE) united a group of city-states to become Ancient Greece."
Kinds of war.
"Sometimes, people don't see a difference between fighting between countries or people, and the formal declaration of a state of war. Those who do see this difference usually only use the word ""war"" for the fighting where the countries' governments have officially declared war on each other. Smaller armed conflicts are often called riots, rebellions, coups, etc."
One country may send forces to another country for a variety of reasons. Sometimes it is to help keep order or prevent killings of innocents or other crimes against humanity. It may be to protect a friendly government against an uprising. Here it may be called a police action or humanitarian intervention instead of a war. Some people think it's still a war.
"Another kind of war existed from 1947 until 1991 called the Cold War. This started when diplomatic relations between the United States and the Soviet Union broke down. Both countries had nuclear weapons and both stood ready to use them against the other. But there was no actual war between the two. It ended with the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. The cold war was also called a containment where the United States tried to prevent the spread of communism to other countries. During the cold war, the major powers did not fight themselves, but often backed third parties in what was called a proxy war. The Vietnam War is often given as an example of a proxy war. But proxy wars happened long before the cold war and are still happening."
"A war between peoples and groups in the same country is known as a civil war. It is generally agreed there are two things that make a war a civil war. It must be a struggle between groups in the same country or state over political control or to force a major change in the government's policy. The second criterion is that more than 1000 people have to have been killed, with a minimum of 100 from each side. The American Civil War is an example of a civil war. While the figures are mere estimates, the total casualties are thought to be about 750,000."
Laws of war.
"Only in the last 150 years or so, have states agreed on international laws to limit warfare. This has been mainly for humanitarian reasons. The Geneva conventions and the Hague Conventions are two examples of agreements that establish laws governing wars. Collectively, these are usually called International humanitarian law (IHL). Because these are established laws, they restrict those engaged in armed conflicts to follow the IHL. Also, a country must not only respect the law but they also need to make sure other countries respect it as well. They cannot turn a blind eye (meaning pretend they do not see a thing) to countries who are not following IHC. The first of these was the Geneva Convention in 1864. It became international law with the signatures of 100 countries."
Statistical analysis.
The statistical analysis of war was started by Lewis Fry Richardson following World War I. More recent databases of wars have been assembled by the Correlates of War Project and Peter Brecke.
Yiddish
"Yiddish is a language used by some Jews. At first, it was a dialect of German that Jews began to use in Europe about 1000 years ago. It was and still is used in the United States, especially in New York City, and other countries that now have Jews."
"Most Yiddish words come from German, but many words are also from Hebrew and Slavic languages, especially Polish, and some from French, Hungarian and Latin. Yiddish is written usually by the Hebrew alphabet."
"In the world, Yiddish is spoken by about 3 million people, mainly Hasidic Jews."
European Charter.
"In the Netherlands and Sweden, Yiddish is protected by the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages."
Year
"One year is about 365 days long (except in a leap year). It is the time it takes the Earth to go completely around (orbit) the sun once. A year is actually almost 365.25 days long, but a calendar has 365 days, except in a leap year, which has 366 days."
"The year starts on January 1 and ends on December 31 in the Gregorian calendar, but a fiscal year or a school year can start on a different day of the year."
There are several ways used to measure the length of a year.
Solar and lunar years are used by different calendars for daily life. The other measurements are used by astronomers.
A specific calendar is provided for the liturgical year.

"Hot air systems use hot air to heat the floor, similar to the Romans' systems. However, air does not hold heat very well, and these systems aren't recommended for residential use."
Hot water systems.
"Hot water systems are the most popular and cost-effective systems for cold climates. In this type of system, water is heated by a boiler and pumped through pipes laid underneath the floor. Hot water systems can also be combined with solar thermal energy to make them more environmentally friendly. Solar thermal energy uses sunlight to heat water, which can then be used in the underfloor heating system."
"Hot water systems can also be run in reverse by running cold water through the pipes to cool the building. However, this technology is difficult to use properly and can result in condensation on the floor, which can ruin hardwood floors or rugs and make people more likely to fall."
Electric systems.
"Electric systems are made of electric cables that are laid underneath the floor. Electricity is then used to heat the cables, and this type of system can be turned on or off much faster than a hot water system. However, these systems are often more expensive than hot water systems because of the high prices of electricity, especially if the hot water system includes the use of solar thermal energy. The high cost of an electric heating system can be reduced if the floor can be set to heat during non-peak hours, such as late at night, and is left turned off during the day. Electric systems are also less environmentally friendly because electricity is usually produced by burning fossil fuels, which increases carbon emissions."
Underfloor installation.
"Underfloor radiant heating systems can be installed as either wet or dry systems. Wet systems are laid down and then concrete is poured over them. Concrete floors hold heat very well, but can take a long time to absorb the heat. Dry systems run in open air space between the foundation and the floor, but can be less efficient because they have to heat the air too. However, dry systems are much easier to reach if the system breaks or leaks."
"Any kind of flooring can be used with underfloor heating, but ceramic tiles are the most popular floor material because they transfer and store heat well. Materials like wood, carpet, or linoleum tile decrease the heat transfer from the underfloor system and the system must be set at a higher temperature if any of these materials are used."
Wall and overhead heating.
"Wall and overhead radiant heating systems are usually made of aluminum panels hung on the walls or ceiling. Like underfloor radiant heating, these panels can be heated by either hot water or electricity. However, panels heated by hot water often leak, so electric panels are the most common. These panels can't heat as much area as an underfloor system, but they can be quickly turned on and off when a person enters or leaves the room. Electric panels can reduce energy costs if panels are left turned off in empty rooms."
Outdoor heating.
"Using radiant heating outdoors is much more practical than heating air because the air is always moving outside. Outdoor radiant heaters are almost always electric devices, and usually portable, although it is possible to have underfloor radiant heating installed under a patio."
74 (number)
Seventy-four is a number. It comes after seventy-three and before seventy-five.
Top Gear
Top Gear is a television show on the BBC. The show is all about cars and other vehicles. They test new cars to see how fast they go. They also test really old cars and do crazy stuff with them. They usually rate cars that the normal person wouldn't be able to afford. The show started as a regular car show but has changed over time to what it is now. It uses comedy to attract viewers which are now estimated to be 350 million.
Segments.
Races.
The show often has long distance races. They usually race a fast car against a different form of transportation like trains and boats. They are called 'epic' races.
They also have smaller races where they match up cars of different times to see which one outperforms the other.
Challenge.
The challenge part of the show is about different stunts of the most ridiculous things the show can come up with. One time they jumped a bus over a row of motorcycles (instead of the motorcycle jumping over buses).
"Recently, the show has started using the phrase ""How hard can it be?"" for the challenge segment. They put themselves in different situations that a normal person probably wouldn't get a chance to experience."
Star in a Reasonably-Priced Car.
Once during every episode (except some specials) they bring a celebrity on stage. They show footage of the celebrity driving an average car around a racetrack. They put the time it took for them to complete a lap of the track on a board with the names of all of the other celebrities who drove the same course.
Power Laps.
Power laps are one lap around the Top Gear Test Track. They will take any car that can drive and will see how fast it can make it around the track. The vehicles must be cars and they must be road legal.

Afrikaner people
"Afrikaners are white South Africans who speak Afrikaans as mother tongue and follow the Afrikaans culture. Most of them have Dutch, German, French Huguenot, ancestors. Also known as Boere, Voortrekkers and Burgers, although under slightly different contexts. In South Africa there are about 3 million white people with Afrikaans as mother tongue, that can be assumed to be Afrikaners if they chose to follow the Afrikaans culture."
John Lennon
"John Winston Ono Lennon (born John Winston Lennon; 9 October 1940 – 8 December 1980) was an English singer and songwriter. He became famous as a singer and guitarist of the English rock band The Beatles. After the Beatles stopped making records in 1970, he lived in the United States with his wife Yoko Ono. He continued his music career up until his murder."
Early life.
"John Winston Lennon was born on 9 October 1940 at Liverpool Women's Hospital in Liverpool, the son of Alfred Lennon and Julia Lennon."
"He started the Beatles in his hometown of Liverpool, with Paul McCartney and George Harrison. After Ringo Starr joined the band, they started to be very successful. People were excited by their music, and their live performances always pleased audiences. Manager Brian Epstein and record producer George Martin helped the Beatles become the most popular act in entertainment."
"Lennon played the guitar, and later learned to play the piano. Most of the songs the Beatles recorded were written by Lennon and McCartney. Their songs were always credited as by ""Lennon/McCartney"" on Beatles records, but in fact they usually wrote their songs on their own. The two men often helped to make each other's songs better, so they liked to share writing credit. Famous songs written by Lennon for the Beatles are ""A Hard Day's Night"", ""Help!"", ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", ""A Day In The Life"" and many others."
"The Beatles grew apart as the members got older. Lennon divorced his first wife, Cynthia Powell, and married Yoko Ono, while McCartney married Linda Eastman. Each wife had different ideas, and encouraged their husbands to depend less on each other. Later, some fans blamed Yoko and Linda for breaking the Beatles up."
"Lennon loved his wife so much that he added her surname Ono to his own name, since she became Yoko Ono Lennon when she married him. He had never liked his middle name Winston (given him by his mother after Winston Churchill) and wanted to change it, but was told he could not under British law. He could add a new name though, so he did that. He never used the name Winston again, unless he had to for legal reasons (such as when he travelled to America). Otherwise he gave his ""full name"" as John Ono Lennon."
Career and family life.
"Lennon recorded several albums and singles after the Beatles disbanded. The best-known one was ""Imagine"". He made many records with Yoko Ono. On some records they called themselves the Plastic Ono Band. Lennon and Ono worked with different musician friends, including Ringo Starr, Jim Keltner, Klaus Voormann, Harry Nilsson, Eric Clapton and Elton John. Lennon's solo music was different from his Beatles songs. He spoke more directly about his own feelings, and sometimes used harsh language or loud sounds. This upset a few fans, who wished for more Beatles music from him."
"Lennon and Ono moved to the United States in 1971, and settled in New York City. Ono had a daughter, Kyoko Chan Cox, from an earlier husband, Anthony Cox, a filmmaker, who took her and disappeared. It was easier to look for Kyoko, and get the law's help to look, if they stayed in America. Ono and Lennon were also hurt emotionally by the way Ono was treated by many people in England. Some insulted Ono, and asked Lennon why he was with her. On the other hand, most of the people they met in America accepted them together."
"Lennon and Ono were also campaigners for peace in the world. They used Lennon's famous name to talk to the media (television, radio and newspapers) about their beliefs. Lennon and Ono were sometimes in trouble with people like politicians, who did not like the things they said. President Richard Nixon's administration even tried to deport Lennon, because of his political views."
"The two things Lennon and Ono wanted most were to live permanently in the United States, and to have a child together. Their lives were stressful in the early 1970s for several reasons. There were the problems with immigrating to the United States, and with the search for Kyoko. The public were also sometimes negative toward Ono, her music, and her ideas. The couple had several miscarriages, caused partly by the stress."
"Lennon also had business problems, because leaving the Beatles was not as simple as quitting an ordinary job. The Beatles had signed many contracts. They promised to do things in a certain way, meet deadlines, and work together, to be paid as musicians and songwriters. Many business deals had to be finished or changed, and new deals had to be made, to continue their music careers apart. This took time, and meant making many hard decisions. The four former Beatles could not always agree on what to do with the things they owned together. It took years to work out what to still own in common, what to divide up, and what to let go. The choices they had to make sometimes hurt their friendship."
"Lennon and Ono separated for over a year, from late 1973 until early 1975, because of the stress in their lives, and their relationship. Each of them dated another person (Lennon pairing off with May Pang, his and Ono's personal assistant, and Ono with guitarist David Spinozza), and they were nearly divorced. They spoke nearly every day by telephone, however, and tried to work things out. They decided that they wanted to be together more than anyone else could want them apart, and they reunited."
"When Richard Nixon faced the Watergate crisis in 1974, it became more important than pushing Lennon out of the country. The deportation case against him was dropped. Lennon won the right to stay in America in 1975. Lennon and Ono also finally had a son, Sean Lennon, that October. Father and son shared the same birthday."
"Lennon and Ono stopped making music for five years, to be able to spend more time together, and give Sean as much attention as he needed. They lived on Lennon's income from the music he already made. Ono became Lennon's business manager, and invested his money in real estate and organic farming. Her office was downstairs in the Dakota, the apartment building where they lived, so they were never far apart. Lennon became a full-time father to Sean, and he was proud to call himself a ""househusband"". They also visited Ono's family in Japan several times, and made other trips."
"In 1980 Lennon and Ono began to write new music, as Sean got old enough to begin school. They recorded a new album titled ""Double Fantasy"" that year. A single from the album, ""(Just Like) Starting Over"", was a hit, and people welcomed Lennon back. Even people who had not liked Ono earlier now respected her, and more of them began to like her music. Lennon and Ono planned to start fresh, do a world tour, and record more albums."
Death.
"On 8 December 1980, Lennon was shot dead as he was going into his home, by a man named Mark David Chapman who was mentally ill. Even though he was ill, Chapman was still prosecuted for murdering Lennon. Chapman pled guilty to the murder the next year, and is still in prison today. He admitted later he was jealous of Lennon's fame and success, while his own life disappointed him. Chapman thought that killing Lennon would give his own life more meaning. He is always refused for parole, and is infamous (hated by many people)."
"Fans all over the world mourned Lennon's death. It made them feel that a special part of their lives was gone. Many met in New York's Central Park, near where Lennon and Ono lived, to say their goodbyes. Some played recordings of Lennon's music. Politicians and celebrities everywhere were sorry Lennon had died, even if they disliked him, because his music meant so much to so many people. Radio stations in the Soviet Union, where rock music was rarely allowed to be played, gave an hour over to Beatles recordings."
"There was no funeral for Lennon, but Yoko Ono asked people everywhere to observe ten minutes of silence and prayer for him on Sunday, December 14, 1980, at 2:00 PM. At two o'clock, the music playing in Central Park stopped, and people all over the world fell silent for ten minutes. Other tributes came later, including songs by George Harrison (""All Those Years Ago""), Paul McCartney (""Here Today""), Elton John (""Empty Garden (Hey Hey Johnny)"") and Queen (""Life Is Real (Song for Lennon)"")."
Legacy.
"Lennon's music (with and after his Beatles years) is still played everywhere, and people are still touched by it. A series of radio programs were devoted to playing demoes of his songs. Young musicians play Lennon's records, and learn his music. Yoko Ono released an album of acoustic versions of many Lennon songs, to help musicians understand them better."
"There is now a garden in Central Park in Lennon's memory called ""Strawberry Fields"" after one of Lennon's most popular songs, which in turn was named after a Salvation Army orphanage near his childhood home. On October 9, 1990, on what would have been Lennon's fiftieth birthday, ""Imagine"" was simulcast on radio and television stations all over the world, uniting people everywhere to remember Lennon and his music."
Awards.
With The Beatles.
Billy Preston
"Billy Preston (September 2, 1946 - June 5, 2006) was an American R&amp;B musician. He is best known for his piano and organ playing."
"Preston began playing piano when he was three years old. He worked with many other musicians including Aretha Franklin, Sammy Davis Jr., Quincy Jones, Eric Clapton, the Jackson 5 and the Rolling Stones."
"He worked on The Beatles's last album, ""Let It Be"", in 1969, including the song ""Get Back"". Many people thought that Preston would join the group, but the Beatles broke up shortly afterwards. He later worked with George Harrison, who had been a Beatle."
"Preston's biggest success also came from working with another musician. He did a duet with Syreeta Garrett on ""With You I'm Born Again"" in 1979. It sold over a million copies and reached Number 2 in the United Kingdom singles chart."
Preston was gay. He died of respiratory failure after being in a coma from a heart infection.
Pop
A pop is an onomatopoeic term for a quick sharp explosion.
Pop or POP could also mean:
Computer virus
"A computer virus is a program that is able to copy itself when it is run. Often, computer viruses are run as a part of other programs. Any program that is affected by the virus is ""infected"". Biological viruses also work that way, as they copy themselves as part of other organisms. This is how the computer virus got its name."
"In addition to copying itself, a computer virus can also execute instructions that cause harm. For this reason, computer viruses affect security. They are part of malware."
"Very often, the term is also used for other kinds of malware, such as trojan horses and worms. Even though this is wrong, it may be difficult to tell the difference between different kinds of malware; they often occur together, and only an expert may be able to tell them apart. Such programs also fit more than one category."
"Computer viruses are created for a cause, sometimes they are created to spread political messages and they are also created to hack some system files."
"Computer viruses are spread through many ways. Some of the common ways of spreading are through downloads, email attachments, removable hardwares, and so on. Most viruses are very dangerous kind of malware."
Kinds of computer viruses.
There are different kinds of computer viruses:
Limited user rights can limit the spread of a virus.
"In the beginning, operating systems on personal computers (or PC) did not have the concept of access control. There were no ""users"", everyone could do everything. Modern operating systems have the concept of access control. There can be more than one user and some users may have more ""privileges"" than others. Certain users may only have access to certain files and are unable to access others. Other users may be able to modify or delete certain files. These privileges can be specified for each file."
"The damage a virus can cause is influenced by the rights the user has; if the user has no rights to write to certain places in the system, the virus will not be able to spread to those places."
"Another problem is that sometimes the system for rights management may be available, but that it is not used by default. This is the case with systems such as Windows NT or Windows XP, where by default all users have same rights."
Antivirus software.
"Antivirus software can protect computers against known viruses. Some antivirus software scan files and compare a hash code for each file with its database of hash codes (or ""signature""). If the code matches, it has likely found a virus. This way of doing things has created some problems. It will only protect against viruses whose hash code is known. The companies that wrote the antivirus need to keep the virus signatures up-to-date and need to give this information to the PC to be protected."
"There are two possible modes of scanning: Either the file is scanned ""on demand"" (or ""manually""), or it is scanned when the system registers an access to the file called ""on access""."
"Antivirus software cannot offer full protection, even in the case the virus is known. Some viruses use something called polymorphic code to change their signature every time they move. No matter how many signatures the company has, they will not be able to stop these types of viruses."
"Another way that antivirus software can protect against viruses is to use heuristics. Instead of knowing each virus by its signature, heuristic antivirus software look at the behavior of other software. If a software does something that seems bad, the antivirus software steps-in to stop it. Since every step needs to be watched, this is a slow way to do things."
"""Live system""."
"The best protection against viruses can be obtained by using a system that boots off a read-only medium, such as a compact disc (called CD), digital versatile disc (called DVD), or USB flash drive (called USB) that does not allow write access to hard disk (or other removable media). This limits the usability of the computer as it is not possible to save documents or install new programs. Only -R media (not -RW) should be used, and the media should be finalized to prevent creating a new session that might possibly contain a virus."
Mac
What it does.
"When breathing in, the diaphragm pulls down so that the size of the lungs increases, allowing air to enter the lungs."
"When breathing out, the diaphragm rests and goes up making a dome shape, decreasing the size of the lungs and pushing air out."
This increases the surface area of the air so that there is more oxygen that the lungs can hold.
Germ theory of disease
"The Germ theory of disease is a theory in biology. It says that small organisms (called germs), also known as microbes, cause some diseases. These diseases are called infectious diseases. The germ theory states that small organisms cause a reaction in the body of those who are infected. The body's reaction to infection is called a disease."
"Many scientists and doctors in history figured out that diseases are caused by microscopic organisms. Even after the microscope was invented, people still didn't know that germs caused diseases. People long believed that ""bad air"" from stinky trash dumps and from rotting meat was the cause of diseases. So people thought that covering their mouth and nose with a cloth would help filter out the ""bad air."" Scientists and doctors would use garlic and perfumes to ward off the bad air. But people still got sick and even died, so this theory was wrong. Polluted air is not the cause of disease."
"One problem with the old theories of disease was that people believed that living things were spontaneously generated. Spontaneous generation is when something like a fly grows from a small speck of smelly meat. That old theory is called abiogenesis. In the seventeenth century, Francesco Redi (February 18, 1626 – March 1, 1697) discovered that flies lay eggs that become maggots. Prior to this, people thought that maggots came from rotting meat. He discovered this by sealing some meat in a jar and watching it. No maggots were found on the sealed meat. He also put some meat in a jar and covered it with gauze. Maggots were found on the gauze but not inside the jar. But when he placed meat in an open jar, maggots were found on the meat and inside the jar. Experiments like this proved that maggots come from flies who lay eggs, not from rotting meat. Later scientists would prove that diseases did not come from the air. Diseases are spread by infection."
Sanitation.
"Also in the eighteenth century, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek discovered the first microscopic organisms with a microscope. He was the first microbiologist. He saw some of the microscopic organisms that cause diseases, but he didn't know what they were. In 1700, Nicolas Andry thought that some of these microscopic organisms caused smallpox and other diseases. Over 100 years later, Agostino Bassi figured out what caused disease in silkworms. Ignaz Semmelweis was a doctor who figured out that if doctors washed their hands after touching dead people, that other patients wouldn't get sick. That was in 1847. It was about this time that sanitation and hand washing became popular with some, but not all doctors. Doctors began to use chemicals to cleanse wounds and clean their tools between each patient."
"One of the most famous experiments of the nineteenth century was when John Snow discovered the source of a cholera outbreak. It turns out that cholera is transmitted when human waste contaminates water that people drink. Snow found out that there was a large number of sick people in Soho in London. After talking to many people in the area and mapping where each sick person lived, he realized that the sick people were almost all getting their drinking water from the same public water pump. He solved the epidemic by having the water pump's handle removed so that the people would get water from some other place. It worked, and the epidemic was soon over."
"Louis Pasteur showed that the germ theory of disease was true. In 1862, he invented a process that heats up a liquid to a high temperature to keep it from spoiling. This process is known as pasteurization, named after Pasteur. Pasteurization is used to kill microscopic organisms in liquids like milk, wine, and beer. Liquids that are pasteurized will last much longer before they spoil."
"Later, he did an experiment with fermentation. In one case he made a broth that he put inside a jar with a very long winding tube, so that no particles could pass to it from outside. Air could get inside the tube, but almost no dust. The broth he made did not change, and no fermentation took place."
"He then took a similar broth, but this time he allowed air and dust to go inside the jar. This time, fermentation took place. The thing that caused fermentation therefore needed to come from outside (the environment). And it wasn't just air that caused fermentation, it must be something floating in the air which was very small. We now know that small particles called yeast cause fermentation."
"In the latter part of the nineteenth century, Robert Koch and Joseph Lister would go on and help establish the germ theory of disease as an important part of science and medicine. Koch's theories are called ""postulates"" and helped medical researchers know what causes diseases. Lister's ideas would help establish sanitation as a major defense against disease. Koch's postulates and Lister's sanitation discoveries are still very important today."
"We now know that small things cause diseases. Each one of these things can cause infection: fungus, bacteria, virus, prion, yeast, protist."
Labor Day
Labor Day is a holiday in the United States and Canada on the first Monday of September. This holiday honors workers. It is similar to the May Day holiday in other countries. Many businesses close on Labor Day. Many students start school the day after Labor Day.
"In some countries, it is known as International Workers' Day. It is celebrated every year on May 1 in almost 80 countries in the world. The day is celebrated on a different day, such as the first Monday of September in the United States."
Christian cross
The Christian cross is the main symbol of the Christian religion. These crosses are usually found on Christian churches.
"Jesus, who many Christians believe is God the Son and their Messiah, was crucified (nailed to a large wooden cross). This was a commonly used method for killing people in Roman times."
"Christians believe that Jesus' death made the sins of all humans who trust in him, go away, and that they are forgiven. They also believe that Jesus was resurrected (came back to life) after three days. Because of this, the cross is a symbol for Jesus' sacrifice and suffering, but also a symbol of hope, forgiveness of sins, and victory over death."
There are several different Christian crosses that are symbols for different Christian groups or persons.
A cross with the body of Jesus on it is called a Crucifix.
"The empty cross is usually favoured by Protestants and Eastern Orthodox, and the symbol reminds them of the Resurrection of Jesus, though the Orthodox will add a slanted footbar, as well. The crucifix is favoured by Catholic churches and is a reminder of Christ's sacrifice. Jehovah's Witnesses believe that Jesus died on a simple upright pole, a ""torture stake"" ; and only display it as a picture of an impaled Jesus in their literature."
Christians remember the death of Jesus on the cross on Good Friday every year.
Latin Cross.
The most common cross is the Latin Cross. The cross represents and memorializes Christ's death.
"At Survivor Series, the match between Hart and Michaels was the main event (final match) of the show. At the end of the match, Michaels had put Hart in a wrestling hold called the ""Sharpshooter"". This was a hold that Hart liked to use, and won a lot of matches with. The ending of the match was supposed to have D-Generation X (a group of Shawn Michaels' on-screen friends) and The Hart Foundation (a group of Bret Hart's relatives and on-screen friends) run out to try and help. This meant the match would end without a winner. After that, Hart would give up the belt."
"Instead, Earl Hebner, the referee, called for the match to end. He acted like Bret Hart had given up in the hold, even though he had not. The bell rang and the match ended. This meant that Shawn Michaels was the new WWF Champion. Hart was angry because this was not what had been planned. He spat at McMahon, who had planned this. The fans were also angry, and booed McMahon and Michaels while cheering Hart."
After the screwjob.
"Bret Hart went to WCW, where he wrestled for two years until he retired."
"Because the fans hated McMahon for what he had done, he decided to act like a villain on-screen. He was shown as the owner of the WWF (before, he pretended others owned it) and played the role of an evil boss. He had a long storyline with Stone Cold Steve Austin, who was a very popular hero at the time."
"On the January 4, 2010 episode of ""Raw"", Hart made up with Michaels by shaking his hand and hugging in the ring."
Animism
"Animism is a belief common in many different religions and philosophies. An animist is a person who believes or practices animism. Animism is the belief that there is more in nature than the physical things that can be seen and touched. The part that is not physical can be called a soul, life force, or spirit. Physical things come in two types: things that are alive and things that are not alive. Animals and plants are alive. Most animists believe animals and plants have a spirit. Some animists also believe some non-living parts of nature have spirits. These non-living parts of nature include the wind, the rain, and geographic features like mountains and rivers."
"The word ""Animism"" looks like the words of other belief systems with the suffix ""-ism."" However, it is not like other belief systems. Animism is not organized on purpose. Animists did not come up with the word ""Animism."" Animists did not apply the word to themselves. Instead, Animism is an idea of European anthropologists. The first anthropologist who described Animism was Edward B. Taylor. Taylor was trying to describe what was similar among many groups all over the world. The word ""Animism"" is very new: it was first used in 1832. In contrast, the ideas described by ""Animism"" are very old. The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy claims that Animism ""has been the dominant religious tradition across all human societies since our ancestors first left Africa."""
"The kind of ""spirit""."
"The word ""animism"" is based on the word ""anima"" from Latin. ""Anima"" means breath, life, or spirit. However, these are English words. The ideas of animism are often not from people who speak English. This means there is not one definition of spirit. The definitions are different in different animist groups. The following definitions are from the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Some groups believe that nature moves and interacts because of the spirit in things. Other groups believe that nature has more than just a spirit of movement. They believe that spirits in nature are persons like humans are persons. They believe that persons of nature can have a ""social relationship"" with other persons. Other groups believe that the persons of nature are dead relatives of humans who are alive. Still other groups believe that a single plant or animal may be many spirits in one. They believe that existence, movements, and more are each a separate spirit. In summary, not all animists define ""spirit"" the same way, but animists do believe similar things. They believe there is a spirit in many things which are not humans. They believe these spirits are why things that are not human move and interact."
The kinds of Animist belief.
Differences between Animism and similar beliefs.
"Animism is different from other similar beliefs. However, it is often confused with other similar beliefs. First, Animism is not Hylozoism. Hylozoism claims that the entire universe is alive and has an animating power like a spirit. Animism does not claim that the universe is alive. Animism does not believe all things are alive. Second, Animism is not Panpsychism. Panpsychism claims that all things have a mind and that mentality is the reason why the universe can exist. Animism claims that only some things have a mind. Animism does not believe that things must have a mind in order to exist. Third, Animism is not Vitalism. Vitalism claims that things which are alive cannot be explained without a spiritual as well as physical reason. Animism does not always believe that everything alive has a spirit. Animism also sometimes believes that non-living things have spirits."
Differences between Animism and Theism.
"Animism is often compatible with Theism. Theism is the belief in the divine. The divine can be a single god (monotheism), many gods (polytheism), or everything (pantheism). Theists believe that the divine is ""transcendent,"" separate from human life. However, Animism is neither monotheistic nor polytheistic. The spirits of Animist belief are not transcendent, and that is why humans interact with them. Also, Animism is not pantheistic. The spirits of Animism are not all one (monism), but are unique to each thing with a spirit."
"""Old Animism"" and ""New Animism""."
"Animism is an idea described by anthropologists, not Animists. As anthropologists have studied Animism, they have changed their minds on how to describe it. This means that the first definition of Animism is now known as ""Old Animism."" The first definition was offered by Ernst Stahl in the 1800s. Stahl was a chemist and physician. He was not describing a religious belief. However, Edward Tylor borrowed his word to use for religious beliefs in other parts of the world. These beliefs were different and older from what Tylor believed. Because they were different and older, Tylor argued that his beliefs must have developed from Animist beliefs. He argued that all people groups develop in this way. The main change he proposed was that people move from religious explanations for the world to scientific explanations for the world. This was called the social evolutionary approach to anthropology. It is not popular with anthropologists since the 1920s."
"Now, anthropologists have stopped thinking of Animism as a way of explaining the world. Now, Animism is described as a way of relating to the world. This is the difference: the ""old Animism"" explained the unknown, but ""new Animism"" builds relationships with non-human people. This change in definitions is possible mostly because of Alfred Irving Hallowell. Hallowell studied the Berens River Ojibwe of North America in the 1930s. He lived with them. He learned that the Ojibwe do not think there is a spirit in all things at all times. They do not believe spirits explain every question. Instead, the spirits of things which interact with humans as persons. Animism for the Ojibwe is about relationships. Hallowell said the best way to understand this ""new"" Animism was to also believe in it. It is not common for anthropologists to believe similar things to the people they write about. However, this definition of Animism is the one that anthropologists are writing about today."

A proto-language is a language that all languages in a language family came from.
WrestleMania X-Seven
"WrestleMania X-Seven was the seventeenth yearly WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view made by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). It happened on April 1, 2001 at the Reliant Astrodome in Houston, Texas. The event was the first WrestleMania held in the state of Texas. The amount of people who went to the event broke the record for total number of people attending at the Reliant Astrodome. The total number of people was counted at of 67,925. It resulted in total receipt of $3.5 million. The event is often cited as the end of The Attitude Era."
"The main event was a No Disqualification match between Steve Austin and The Rock for the WWF Championship. During the match, Austin turned heel after he told Vince McMahon, a man that he had called his nemesis, to give him a chair. Austin hit The Rock with sixteen chair shots, which lead to Austin pinning The Rock and becoming the new WWF Champion. The PPV ended with Austin and McMahon shaking hands and sharing beers."
"The main matches on the undercard featured Triple H vs. The Undertaker, the second Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match for the WWF Tag Team Championship, and Vince McMahon versus Shane McMahon in a Street Fight."
Central Florida
"Central Florida is the central region of the United States state of Florida, on the East Coast. The region enjoys a hot but stormy climate, with many thunderstorms, and hurricanes threatening often."
"The exact boundary of the area may be in dispute. Central Florida tends to be thought of as the area around metropolitan Orlando, including Orange, Osceola, Seminole, Lake, Brevard, and Volusia counties. Polk and Sumter counties are considered by some, including the local media, to be part of Central Florida. Although geographically in the central part of the state, usually the west central coast, including Hillsborough, Pinellas, Pasco, and Hernando counties, is considered the Tampa Bay area or the Suncoast, rather than a part of Central Florida. This area is known as the I-4 corridor."
"Einstein's two sons were Hans Albert Einstein and Eduard Tete Einstein. Hans Albert was born in Bern, Switzerland in May 1904. He became a professor in Berkeley (California). Eduard was born in Zürich, Switzerland in July 1910. He died at 55 years old of a stroke in the Psychiatric University Hospital Zurich ""Burghölzli"" . He had spent his life in and out of hospitals due to his schizophrenia."
Later life.
"In spring of 1914, he moved back to Germany, and became ordinary member of the Prussian Academy and director of a newly established institute for physics of the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft. He lived in Berlin and finished the General Theory of Relativity in November 1915. In the Weimar Republic, he was politically active for socialism and Zionism. In 1922, he received the Nobel prize for Physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect in 1905. He then tried to formulate a general field theory uniting gravitation and electromagnetism, without success. He had reservations about the quantum mechanics invented by Heisenberg (1925) and Schrödinger (1926). In spring of 1933, Einstein and Elsa were traveling in the USA when the Nazi party came to power. The Nazis were violently antisemitic. They Einstein's relativity theory ""Jewish physics,"" and some German physicists started polemics against his theories. Others, like Planck and Heisenberg, defended Einstein."
"After their return to Belgium, considering the threats from the Nazis, Einstein resigned from his position in the Prussian Academy in a letter from Oostende. Einstein and Elsa decided not to go back to Berlin and moved to Princeton, New Jersey in the United States, and in 1940 he became a United States citizen."
"Before World War II, in August 1939, Einstein at the suggestion of Leó Szilárd wrote to the U.S. president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, to say that the United States should invent an atomic bomb so that the Nazi government could not beat them to the punch. He signed the letter. However, he was not part of the Manhattan Project, which was the that created the atomic bomb."
"Einstein, a Jew but not an Israeli citizen, was offered the presidency in 1952 but turned it down, stating ""I am deeply moved by the offer from our State of Israel, and at once saddened and ashamed that I cannot accept it."" Ehud Olmert was reported to be considering offering the presidency to another non-Israeli, Elie Wiesel, but he was said to be ""very not interested""."
"He did his research on gravitation at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, New Jersey until his death on 18 April 1955 of a aortic aneurysm. He was still writing about quantum physics hours before he died."
He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics.
Photoelectric Effect.
In 1905 he came up with a theory that light was made of small particles called photons . Using this theory he was able to explain the photoelectric effect. The formula relating the energy and frequency of a photon is formula_2. This means that higher frequency light has more energy per photon.
"The photoelectric effect happens when light shining on a metal surface causes it to emit electrons. The difficulty for the classical wave theory was to explain why this effect only seems to occur for high frequency light such as UV, but not lower frequency such as red or infrared."
"Einstein showed that, since higher frequency light has photons with more energy, it has a greater chance of forcing electrons out of the metal."
"Einstein was also able to explain other phenomena with photons, such as fluorescence and ionization. In 1921 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for this discovery."
Theory of Relativity.
"The theory of special relativity was published by Einstein in 1905, in the paper ""On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies"". It says that both distance measurements and time measurements change near the speed of light. This means that as one get closer to the speed of light (nearly 300,000 kilometres per second), lengths appear to get shorter, and clocks tick more slowly. Einstein said that special relativity is based on two ideas. The first is that the laws of physics are the same for all observers that are not moving in relation to each other."
"Things going in the same direction at the same speed are said to be in an ""inertial frame""."
"People in the same ""frame"" measure how long something takes to happen. Their clocks keep the same time. But in another ""frame"" their clocks move at a different rate. The reason this happens is as follows. No matter how an observer is moving, if he measures the speed of the light coming from that star it will always be the same number."
"Imagine an astronaut were all alone in a different universe. It just has an astronaut and a spaceship. Is he moving? Is he standing still? Those questions do not mean anything. Why? Because when we say we are moving we mean that we can measure our distance from something else at various times. If the numbers get bigger we are moving away. If the numbers get smaller we are moving closer. To have movement you must have at least two things. An airplane can be moving at several hundred kilometers per hour, but passengers say, ""I am just sitting here."""
"Suppose some people are on a spaceship and they want to make an accurate clock. At one end they put a mirror, and at the other end they put a simple machine. It shoots one short burst of light toward the mirror and then waits. The light hits the mirror and bounces back. When it hits a light detector on the machine, the machine says, ""Count = 1,"" it simultaneously shoots another short burst of light toward the mirror, and when that light comes back the machine says, ""Count = 2."" They decide that a certain number of bounces will be defined as a second, and they make the machine change the seconds counter every time it has detected that number of bounces. Every time it changes the seconds counter it also flashes a light out through a porthole under the machine. So somebody outside can see the light flashing every second."
"Every grade school child learns the formula d=rt (distance equals rate multiplied by time). We know the speed of light, and we can easily measure the distance between the machine and the mirror and multiple that to give the distance the light travels. So we have both d and r, and we can easily calculate t. The people on the spaceship compare their new ""light clock"" with their various wrist watches and other clocks, and they are satisfied that they can measure time well using their new light clock."
"Now this spaceship happens to be going very fast. They see a flash from the clock on the space ship, and then they see another flash. Only the flashes do not come a second apart. They come at a slower rate. Light always goes at the same speed, d = rt. That is why the clock on the spaceship is not flashing once a second for the outside observer."
"Special relativity also relates energy with mass, in Albert Einstein's E=mc2 formula."
Mass-energy equivalence.
"E=mc2, also called the ""mass-energy equivalence"", is one of the things that Einstein is most famous for. It is a famous equation in physics and math that shows what happens when mass changes to energy or energy changes to mass. The ""E"" in the equation stands for energy. Energy is a number which you give to objects depending on how much they can change other things. For instance, a brick hanging over an egg can put enough energy onto the egg to break it, but a feather can not."
"There are three basic forms of energy: potential energy, kinetic energy, and rest energy. Two of these forms of energy can be seen in the examples given above, and in the example of a pendulum."
"A cannonball hangs on a rope from an iron ring. A horse pulls the cannonball to the right side. When the cannonball is released it will move back and forth as diagrammed. It would do that forever except that the movement of the rope in the ring and rubbing in other places causes friction, and the friction takes away a little energy all the time. If we ignore the losses due to friction, then the energy provided by the horse is given to the cannonball as potential energy. (It has energy because it is up high and can fall down.) As the cannonball swings down it gains more and more speed, so the nearer the bottom it gets the faster it is going and the harder it would hit you if you stood in front of it. Then it slows down as its kinetic energy is changed back into potential energy. ""Kinetic energy"" just means the energy something has because it is moving. ""Potential energy"" just means the energy something has because it is in some higher position than something else."
"When energy moves from one form to another, the amount of energy always remains the same. It cannot be made or destroyed. This rule is called the ""conservation law of energy"". For example, when you throw a ball, the energy is transferred from your hand to the ball as you release it. But the energy that was in your hand, and now the energy that is in the ball, is the same number. For a long time, people thought that the conservation of energy was all there was to talk about."
"When energy transforms into mass, the amount of energy does not remain the same. When mass transforms into energy, the amount of energy also does not remain the same. However, the amount of matter and energy remains the same. Energy turns into mass and mass turns into energy in a way that is defined by Einstein's equation, E = mc2."
"The ""m"" in Einstein's equation stands for mass. Mass is the amount of matter there is in some body. If you knew the number of protons and neutrons in a piece of matter such as a brick, then you could calculate its total mass as the sum of the masses of all the protons and of all the neutrons. (Electrons are so small that they are almost negligible.) Masses pull on each other, and a very large mass such as that of the Earth pulls very hard on things nearby. You would weigh much more on Jupiter than on Earth because Jupiter is so huge. You would weigh much less on the Moon because it is only about one-sixth the mass of Earth. Weight is related to the mass of the brick (or the person) and the mass of whatever is pulling it down on a spring scale – which may be smaller than the smallest moon in the solar system or larger than the Sun."
"Mass, not weight, can be transformed into energy. Another way of expressing this idea is to say that matter can be transformed into energy. Units of mass are used to measure the amount of matter in something. The mass or the amount of matter in something determines how much energy that thing could be changed into."
"Energy can also be transformed into mass. If you were pushing a baby buggy at a slow walk and found it easy to push, but pushed it at a fast walk and found it harder to move, then you would wonder what was wrong with the baby buggy. Then if you tried to run and found that moving the buggy at any faster speed was like pushing against a brick wall, you would be very surprised. The truth is that when something is moved then its mass is increased. Human beings ordinarily do not notice this increase in mass because at the speed humans ordinarily move the increase in mass is almost nothing."
"As speeds get closer to the speed of light, then the changes in mass become impossible not to notice. The basic experience we all share in daily life is that the harder we push something like a car the faster we can get it going. But when something we are pushing is already going at some large part of the speed of light we find that it keeps gaining mass, so it gets harder and harder to get it going faster. It is impossible to make any mass go at the speed of light because to do so would take infinite energy."
"I, I thought when I got my V C R, I'd probably drop it, you know,"
"but that was years,"
"Say you did, uh, starters and bendix springs such as that on an old one."
"Yeah,"
"and, uh, helped my wife replace some carburetors."
Yeah.
"Some that, she had to, uh, label everything"
She had to label everything.
Yeah
"because,"
What was she driving?
It was a Cadillac.
Uh-huh.
"And they, uh, well, they quit making those, the quieter jet carburetor"
and they quit making it.
Yeah.
They rebuilt it
"and it never did, never did run right again."
"Yeah,"
quad not really easy to get rebuilt just right.
Yeah.
"Uh, and like, what were you replacing the starters and bendix on?"
"Uh, a Maverick and also, uh, a Chrysler station wagon before that."
Yeah.
"Did you replace just the, uh, bendix on the Chrysler station wagon or the whole starter?"
"Uh, the,"
"I'm replacing the, two or three starters on the Chrysler."
Yeah.
"They,"
The starters are kind of fragile.
Yeah
"and the,"
"Yep, uh,"
"it's, uh,"
"I, I do a lot of Chinese cooking myself."
I have in the past.
"I haven't done recently,"
"but, uh, it's in the sweet and sour porks and things like are just really delicious meals."
Um. Where did you learn how to do Chinese cooking?
"Uh, just at home."
Uh-huh.
"I, I enjoyed the food"
"and I bought a lot of, uh, good cookbooks,"
and I've been following through on that.
"When you find the right cookbook, why it works out."
Uh-huh.
What's a good reference cookbook for Chinese food?
"Okay,"
"well, that one's a good question."
Here it's right under my nose if I can find it
"Oh, boy."
"I guess one of the things we've, uh, started avoiding is the, uh, run of the mill chop suey and things like that."
"Yeah,"
right.
"But we enjoy trying, uh, different kinds of chicken or, uh, you know, even, uh, shrimp, uh, dishes that are fixed in a Chinese restaurant."
One of this book I have is called CHINESE COOKING MADE EASY.
"Uh, it's a paperback"
and I think it's by someone named Chang.
"Yeah,"
Isabelle Chang.
"Okay,"
"thanks for that, uh, reference."
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"I, I started when I was in, uh, third grade,"
"and I've, I still play the piano as of today."
Do you?
"Yes,"
I do.
"I started,"
I think I was in the fifth grade
and I played it for maybe three months
"But, then, again, I was also in, uh, the marching band."
"I played the drums,"
"I played the clarinet,"
I played the trumpet.
Wow
"Uh, you know, whatever"
"and so I, I still sing,"
and I sing in the choir today
"so,"
All right
"I I enjoy the music,"
it gives me an out.
Yeah.
"It always sounds like,"
"for my playing the piano when I was depressed and didn't have anything else to do and there was no one to play with I could always go play with the piano, you know."
True
"So, how long did you play?"
Only for about three months.
Three months.
"Yeah,"
me and my brother both took the classes
and we got pretty bored quick
"I was going to say, you got as far as the, uh, chop sticks, huh."
"Um, well, I could play, uh, the wood chuck song."
"but, I've seen those, too,"
"but,"
"Okay,"
"so this wasn't necessarily a big conversation,"
"but, I think we, we did it"
"Uh, yeah."
"Okay,"
"and, and your name was Lisa."
Lisa.
Great.
Are you the Expressway sites?
"I am,"
"yes,"
and I work in the north building.
"Oh, okay."
"Uh, well, thank you."
Thank you.
"All right,"
good day.
"Uh-huh,"
bye-bye.
"Uh, advice on son or daughter going to college."
Right.
"Uh, that's advice that I will need in time future for my children, rather than one that I have, uh, personal experience with"
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I suppose I would ask what the child wants to do in life and what the child hopes to, to get out of college and what sort of college would best meet, meet those needs."
Uh-huh.
"Right,"
"uh, let's see,"
"when I, when I went away to school, I'm trying to think my criteria."
"I guess when you're, when you're eighteen or so, uh, it would be important to know if it was a coed college"
"That was a, a strict requirement for me."
"in the north end of the state, you've got that little narrow strip of West Virginia going up between Ohio and Pennsylvania"
Uh-huh.
Right at the base of that northern peninsula is my hometown.
Uh-huh
"Well, that's, yeah, that's interesting."
"So it's really up north in the country, really, ."
"Yeah,"
I guess so.
yeah.
"It's,"
"well, um, my parents' house is like three miles south of where the Mason-Dixon Line would have hit the Ohio River had it continued that far."
Gosh.
I see.
"So,"
It's pretty nice country up there?
"Oh, it's beautiful."
"Hills, or what?"
"Uh, well, from my neck of the woods, it's hilly."
Uh-huh.
"Um, you know, uh, maybe three hundred, four hundred feet elevation, uh,  type variations from the valleys up to the hills, the hilltops."
Uh-huh
Is it farmland?
"Um, not a lot of farmland there."
"Mostly it's, uh,"
"I mean, you know, there's, you know, individuals with their own, own uh, growing their own food."
"Uh, most of the agriculture, it's more in the way of, uh, sheep and cattle."
"Oh, yes."
"And even that's, you know, small time mostly."
Sure.
"Uh, the biggest chunk of what's going on there is, is, uh, industry."
Uh-huh.
It's coal mines and chemical plants and power plants.
"but it was, it was saying don't do STAR TREK management style."
"And they were referring to, you know, Captain Kirk,"
"every time he left the Enterprise, everything went to hell."
Oh.
And nothing got righted until he got back up on the ship
"Right,"
"so he kind of was a cowboy type, too."
Uh-huh
Made all the decisions
"but, uh, Jean Luke does more of a, a, committee type of management."
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
"uh, it's definitely a lot better A lot more realistic really."
What other movies have you seen?
"Uh, saw THE ADDAMS FAMILY last week."
"Oh, how was that?"
It was pretty good.
"Uh, there were a few things different than the old series,"
"but on the, on the whole, it was pretty similar. And, a lot of fun."
"Lots of little funny spots, huh."
"Oh, yeah,"
yeah.
Did they have Thing
"and,"
"Oh, yes,"
"in fact, Thing has a big, much bigger role than he does in the series."
"I mean, you know, there is lots of areas where Thing saves the day."
Really?
And he runs around a lot.
"How did,"
I've always wondered how he gets around.
"Uh, you know, just finger hopping."
yeah
"I, I felt a little guilty about taking the boxes for about two seconds until I realized they would be thrown away,"
so.
"Right,"
"right,"
"I thought, well I was doing them a favor by taking them."
"I found about five, uh, about nine of them that had not even been folded into boxes, that were in the dumpsters."
Yeah.
"Oh gosh,"
"so many people need, so many people go to the grocery store and stuff and get those boxes, when, you know, these are perfect,"
Uh-huh.
so.
"Yeah,"
"the ones at the grocery store, half the time, they've pulled the lid off"
so you can't use it anyway.
"Right,"
"and he had a bunch of computer stuff,"
"and, you know, I bought it all."
It was two hundred bucks for everything he had.
You got a buy.
"Well, some of it wasn't worth anything, you know."
Sure.
"You know, a lot of the, uh, diskettes were just totally unusable."
"Melted, or Just wet"
"or,"
"Well, yeah"
", or wet"
Okay.
"But I did get out of there with, uh, Vermont Views, which is a huge,"
"Okay,"
"Cindy, you there?"
Yeah.
"Oh, the wood chuck song"
And I still can to this date.
"And your mother's saying, and although, the money that we spent for those piano lessons this is all we got was the wood chuck song"
Yeah.
"Yep,"
they went out and bought us a piano
and for three months
"Oh, bless your heart."
"Did you ever, did you ever just bang on it or do anything with it at all."
"Oh, yeah,"
any time I got bored
"Oh, okay,"
"but I mean, can you play anything on it, other than wood chuck song?"
No.
No.
"And Jaws,"
but I think everybody can.
Okay.
"I I, I can still read music if I'm lucky"
"because I,"
"if I work real hard I can still barely read the music,"
"but, see, I played the piano from the third grade all the way through high school,"
Yeah.
so
Yeah.
"I played uh, concertos and other stuff"
"but,"
"I got to the point where I wasn't really reading music, I was memorizing music,"
"so because of that, I can't read music as well as I used to,"
"but anyway,"
Yeah.
"but I enjoy it, though."
"I mean, those people, they'll call you any time of the day or night with, try to solicit"
Yeah.
"and that's an invasion of my privacy, I think."
"They call late,"
"now, I mean, now there's, I heard that they were going to start calling on Saturdays or"
"Oh, they do already."
"See, that's"
I would be so mad
"Well,"
"and I've even had the computer generated calls on Sundays, too."
Really.
Uh-huh.
Huh.
But I do know of a way to get around the computer generated calls.
How?
"Don't answer your phone, Hello."
"The computer's geared to, to start talking to you on the, on the word Hello."
Really?
Uh-huh.
Huh.
"I don't know,"
"I think like things that, that"
"I think's like privacy is like, just like, not going through my stuff, like going through, just like my clothes or my drawer, just going through my stuff, basically."
"Oh, yeah."
That drives me up a wall.
Are you and your roommate a similar size.
"No,"
"see, we're not,"
"and, uh."
And she still goes through your clothes?
"Yeah,"
"she'll take all my shirts and stuff,"
"It's just,"
Yeah.
"like, you know, you go say okay, we can't bring up this point because then they're going to, you know,"
"the opposition will say this, this and this and"
Uh-huh.
"And it's like, boy, the stuff that they can twist around is,"
Yep
it's pretty amazing.
"And it's like the, the truth isn't really important anymore."
"It's,"
"Yeah,"
it's not.
"And then you get people who, who bring in cases just because they want to bring them up just because."
Yep.
"Like this, this friend of mine's pretty obnoxious"
and he really gets into suing people.
"And so he'll, he'll sue just about anybody just for the chance to get into court, and argue his case you know, It is. It's, it's wasting people's time and the taxpayers' money and everything else. *aa,sv"
"but,"
"But, uh,"
Yeah
"but it's for the more general,"
people don't want to take responsibility.
Yeah.
"You know, it's,"
"And, and most of the time they're looking to place blame. Uh  and stuff."
Yep
"See, you're from California,"
is that right?
"Uh, yeah."
Well originally from Chicago
"but,"
"Oh, okay."
same here.
"Uh, very seldom are they any different."
"And then, uh, like for groceries and everything, we try to put, like, two hundred and fifty dollars in a little can in the kitchen"
Uh-huh.
and then that's what we use to buy the groceries with.
"Oh, okay."
"And then we put our receipts in there, you know,"
and usually that's enough.
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, but I don't have any, you know, small children to have anything extra come up, you know, like, uh, running to the doctor or something like that with them."
Right.
Luckily I don't either.
"I mean, you know, maybe my cat would get sick"
"but, I mean, usually that's not so much that it would throw me off"
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
right.
"In fact, I did have to take my dog to the vet the other day"
"But you so you know what I'm saying,"
yeah.
Yeah.
"that, it's worse than having a kid, huh?"
"I,"
sometimes it can be.
Yeah.
Sometimes it can be.
I guess the worst thing I've ever had come out is like car maintenance kinds of things.
Uh-huh.
"But I do try to build in a little extra money each month to, to be able to do that type of thing"
so.
"Yeah,"
"uh, I'm not working right now."
"Well, we've just, uh,"
"it seems like, we've always been at a place where we'd have to go away for the summer or something"
"and, uh, it was,  never convenient to have anything."
Yeah.
we were thinking about getting a dog if we get into a house.
Yeah.
"Uh, someplace where there, you know,"
we can take care of it and everything.
"We've got,  some children who would just really, uh, enjoy having an animal, you know, a dog, I think"
Yeah.
"and, What about you all?"
Yeah.
"Well, right now I'm a student,"
and campus housing does not even allow thinking about that
"Oh, no."
"No,"
we almost got chased out of here for feeding a stray cat.
Is that right?
Yeah.
They're very strict about it.
"But you like, uh, you like pets and things?"
"Oh, I love animals."
"Oh, yeah ."
"I was raised,"
"our house when I, when I was growing up there was almost never, uh, at least one cat in the house."
Uh-huh.
"It was almost always at least one cat, sometimes, you know, like fifteen or twenty. But, uh, always cats in the house."
"Oh, yeah."
"We, we,  enjoyed them."
Oh.
"We like, we like pets,"
"but, uh, you know, you've got to deal with, uh, taking care of them and, and feeding them and everything like that."
"I've driven one uh,"
"I drove a Volkswagen Beetle for a while, about a month."
"Uh, in a month I think I put, uh, three oil coolers on it."
"Uh, every time I turned around I was having trouble with it."
Uh-huh.
"Everything else I ever owned was American built. Uh, mostly older cars."
"Uh, I've been a mechanic,"
"well, I worked, starting working my father's service station when I was about, uh, twelve."
Uh-huh.
"So, I've been around cars a lot, but, uh, driven a lot of old Pontiacs."
"My first three cars were, uh, seventy model Pontiacs. A G T O and a Bonneville and a station wagon."
I had a couple of Chryslers.
Had a super B for a while with a four forty in it.
Uh-huh.
It was a lot of fun.
"But, uh,"
"Not much gas mileage, though."
"I don't know,"
gas mileage wasn't too bad.
It got about seventeen.
"Oh, wow."
"Well, till you got crazy with it."
"You know, you get the four barrel all worked up"
"and suddenly it, it, it drops off fast,"
"but long as you didn't spin the tires too much or, or spend too much time with the secondaries kicked in it, it didn't do too bad on gas."
Yeah.
Didn't have to work too hard to move the car around.
"Now, do you think since they started with electronic ignition that it improves the way the car runs?"
"Oh, yeah,"
"yeah,"
definitely.
Uh-huh.
because she can't wear like my pants
Uh-huh.
but she'll take all my shirts and my blouses and stuff.
Ooh.
"Man, I'm just glad she can't wear my pants or my skirts or my dresses, you know."
"Oh, yeah."
"But still, she'll just take them,"
"and she won't even think about it,"
"and then, I'll like see her that day,"
"and she'll be wearing my clothes,"
"and I'll be like, you know, I don't like to borrow my clothes out, you know,"
I really don't.
So I prefer that you just not go in and get them
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
because she doesn't even ask me.
Stuff like that really
"like that's an invasion of my privacy, I feel like."
"Oh, yeah,"
I agree.
"Stuff like that,"
"when you have your door closed, people just walking in and stuff like that."
Uh-huh.
I was thinking like my mom.
"I know this,"
"she would think this is like an invasion of her privacy, is like going through her purse, like if you ever needed money and stuff"
"Oh, yeah."
"we always just give her her purse, you know,"
and she'll get it out or whatever.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
"I was trying to think,"
"And, uh, then she could be at home"
and then I'd bring her to my house for a couple of hours if I wanted too or whatever.
"But, uh, she paid, I think it was two or, I think it was about two fifty, three dollars a hour"
"and by the time I paid taxes on it, it, I was getting like eighty cents"
and that wasn't counting food or gas or anything.
"Oh, no."
Yeah.
It's hardly worth your time.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's pretty bad.
The only time I baby-sat was in high school
"and it, you know,"
of course you don't
"I didn't pay taxes on that,"
so.
Right.
"It was easy, you know, go over to some, uh,"
it was these people that lived in our neighborhood
and I'd just go over there.
"Every Thursday night, they went to the theater."
They had permanent tickets
"and they'd give me,"
"it was supposed to be two dollars an hour for two kids,"
but they would usually give me like five dollars more at the end of the night.
"Oh, wow."
"And, I mean, they'd, you know,"
it was great.
I'd go over there
"and there would be like, uh, you know, there's, we have these videos over here."
"Watch, whatever you want."
"And there's some Oreos in the, in the cupboard."
not being able to put it off for fifteen years.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Because a lot of these guys, you know, they get in"
"and they, they get off for good behavior"
"and, I don't know,"
"up in Minnesota where I am now, they don't have the death penalty."
"And you can almost sense that people are just laughing at the system, you know. Because they figure well, you know, sure I, I get thirty or forty years for maybe rape or something."
"Uh, but then for,"
"if I, if I elicit good behavior I'm out in maybe five or ten."
"Oh, really?"
"Oh, sure, you know."
Goodness.
"I mean just because, like we said before, they don't have enough room in the jails uh, you know, there's a lot of incentive for them to be let out early."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"But if you've got the death penalty hanging over your head, uh,"
"I don't know,"
I think that may solve a lot of that.
Yeah
"Maybe not solve it,"
"but, I don't know,"
"maybe ,"
"I, yeah I tend to think the repeal system for the death penalty is a little, little too lenient."
Yeah.
"Uh, kind of takes away from the significance of the death penalty."
Uh-huh.
What do you do Georgeanne?
I'm a graduate student at the University of Texas in Dallas.
"Oh, okay."
Great.
What program you in?
They don't tend to get real jealous or territorial.
They like to play.
Um.
Especially with the kids.
They love to play with kids.
"Is, is your dog an inside and outdoors?"
"No,"
he's pretty much an inside dog.
Um.
He stays in.
"We, we're kind of in a, not a real busy neighborhood, but more so than I'd want him to be out too much"
and he doesn't like it if we tie him outside.
"Oh, really?"
He's really a wimp.
"And when it comes to being alone,"
"uh, now if you give him the freedom to walk around and go wherever he wants, he likes that,"
but he does not like to be tied outside.
"He'll, he'll just bark and bark and bark."
"Um, when he gets outside, does, in, does he run away and then eventually come back?"
"No,"
"he's, uh, taken to the training pretty well"
"and, uh, he knows where our yard is"
"and we have a pretty small yard,"
but he seems to know the boundaries.
Um.
"And he usually is good about staying within them,"
"although our next door neighbors have a dog, too"
"and, uh, she, she is good friends with my dog."
"Oh, yeah?"
And so he often gets to smelling her scent and will go over there to sniff around and stuff
"but, he's pretty good."
He stays out of the street
"And we do have a very loving cat that's, you know, kind of our baby."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, and we like pets."
We like them around.
We have grandchildren that run through
"and they think we should have a dog,"
and that's because they have a Great Dane
Huh.
Yes.
They're just huge
Definitely.
"Well, we, you know,"
"if it, um, if it were just more peaceful, you know, with the little ones, we would definitely have a pet."
I just think it's nice to have around.
We had a cat that had kittens.
So any pet that I get from now on will definitely be spayed or neutered.
"Oh, yes,"
yes.
"Because, uh, I did."
That experience was awful
"Yes,"
"I have never wanted to,"
"that's why we've never gotten a female, you know, in anything."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, uh, and our male cats, you know, we had, uh, neutered right away,"
to baby very what you doing ?
"and, of course, it, he doesn't know it."
He's still out partying.
Oh.
"But, um, you know I do think that maybe we'll get a female next time and just had her, have her spayed, you know."
"And, uh,"
"Well, a lot of times now when you buy them from like the S P C A or from the humane societies or whatever, their adoption includes their spaying."
we got that.
Okay.
Pretax insurance?
Yeah.
Yeah.
"But we call it the cafeteria plan,"
I wonder why.
Um?
"I said, I wonder why."
"Oh, it's probably what the first guy who did it, called it."
Cafeteria?
Yeah.
He was probably in the cafeteria when he thought of it
Maybe
so. Let's see what else can we do?
"Changes,"
I'll tell you what we could do.
What?
"We could prohibit people from being hired that are historically going to cost the company money. You know, do a little bit better research on who gets hired"
Uh-huh.
"Because you know,"
"You mean, like for health insurance?"
"Well, not only just health insurance, I mean for the whole benefit of the company."
"See, I look at it this way. If the company folds, I got to go find a job."
Yeah.
Okay.
"Now, if we got somebody in a position to affect the way the company performs, just about anybody in the company, and they're not doing their job or they're not capable of doing their job, then we should find a place to put them or you know, boot them out."
"Well, that's easier done in a company than it is in, uh, school teaching."
"Well, frankly, I think school teachers ought to get about ten times what they're getting paid."
Thank you
What?
"I said, thank you."
I was just thinking
"I wonder, I wonder how, how the civil system or the court system must differ between there and say where I am in Minneapolis."
"I really,"
"From what I understand, it's all pretty the same except when you get to Louisiana."
"And Louisiana is completely different cause it was based on the,"
"what is it,"
it's based on common law
and the rest of the country is not or something like that.
Yeah.
Pretty strange.
"But, uh, fortunately I never have had to go in even, even for jury duty."
"Yeah,"
"I haven't either other than,"
"But, uh, that friend of mine's telling me that I might have to go in for, uh, as a witness."
He may subpoena me.
So we'll see what happens.
"But, uh,"
I'm not really sure how we could change the legal system to make it better. .
Yeah.
"It's,"
"there are too many big problems, you know."
"There's, there's such a backlog of court cases right now. You know, to try to get them all in in a good time"
I know.
and we already have too many lawyers as it is.
Yeah.
"And if it's criminal cases we, you can't put them in jail because there's no room left."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
that's true.
"And, in fact, they're even letting some go."
Yeah.
"I, I, I'm originally from Florida"
"So it's nice to have, you know, one place that you can take them all to instead of driving the glass to one place"
"Yeah,"
yeah.
That's another thing.
You have to go to different places to do that.
Right.
"So it's, so that's nice."
"It would be, it would be really nice if they, uh, came to the house to pick it up"
"and they just were talking about a bill in Tucson about that,"
"but, uh, uh, it didn't go through."
Uh-huh.
"But I heard that most homes that do participate in that are having to pay a monthly fee to do that. Which, uh,"
"I don't know,"
it just doesn't make sense to me.
Right.
"I guess what they, what they were talking about here was, uh, was reducing the garbage collection in order to make that up or something, you know."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Uh, so I guess that's one option."
Yeah.
"That's good,"
that's good.
I guess one thing they're working on now is recycling plastics too.
"Like, uh"
Uh-huh.
"have you noticed that on the bottom of plastic goods, they have this little number now that tells what  kind of plastic it is?"
Huh.
No.
"Yeah,"
"I guess the problem with plastic is there's so many different kinds that you can't recycle,"
you can't just throw all plastic into one recycler.
"Oh, I didn't know that."
I do miss that.
Around here in Plano there are very few trees
"and it's pretty flat and, and kind of barren"
"and that's the only thing that we don't like about living in Texas, is we miss all the beautiful trees and the Fall"
"and, and, um, uh, the landscape is much different here in Texas than it is, you know, in the north. Um, or even where you are."
"Uh, we definitely have a lot of trees here."
"A lot of leaves to rake up too, I bet."
Yes
but fortunately the home owner's association does all that.
"Does that,"
"well, see, that's another plus."
"Yes,"
I don't have to worry about that
"and this is the time of year we're starting to lose,"
they're all falling now.
"That's right,"
"that's right,"
they are.
I'm going to get the kids to get outside with the other neighbor kids and do the little bit of raking that needs to be done.
"We just have a few trees in the front and a few in the back but, not, not much. Just, just a little kind of just in more of a make a little bit of a mess for a few weeks"
"and if you didn't do anything about it, then they'd probably the leaves just blow away"
Right.
It's not too bad.
"Okay,"
do we have to speak for a certain amount of time?
"No,"
I don't think so.
Okay.
Okay.
It was really nice speaking to you.
It was good to speak with you too.
"Okay,"
"so. Does T I have a pretty good retirement package, do you think?"
"I think they have, uh, one that we need to recognize that we're going to have to supplement ourselves."
Yeah.
"And that's certainly one of the reasons that I'm sure that they've begun the, uh, CODA Plan."
Uh-huh.
"It's certainly a, a supplemental way, uh,"
Uh-huh.
"and I suppose if, maybe in, in your instance, if, if you're started with T I in your early to mid-twenties, and happen to stay with them until you're sixty-five, then you'll have a very good retirement plan."
Right.
But I had another career first and then came to T I a little later.
Uh-huh.
"So it's not, uh,"
"all by itself it won't be adequate for, for my situation."
"It's not going to build up, quite enough,"
yeah.
"So, I have to find a way to supplement that."
Yeah.
"Well, they just, they seem to make it so easy to save."
"You know, one of the things that we're doing which is probably the worst investment in the world,"
"but I've got money coming out to buy savings bonds, just coming straight out of my check."
"And it's probably not a great investment,"
"but if I wasn't doing that the money wouldn't be being saved anyway, you know."
"I kind of have to trade off, you know."
"If you never see it you don't spend it,"
"so And it's,"
"I understand though,"
"it,"
Yeah.
"Uh, believe me, I do that myself."
Do you?
Yeah?
And I disagree with you.
"Uh-huh,"
yeah.
"and, um, when, when you do that, they automatically, once you start with their service, they close your accounts out."
"Oh, I see."
"So, I'm still paying on all these accounts,"
but my accounts are closed.
Yeah.
"So, and I would prefer to keep it that way."
"Once we, once we're paid off um, I would prefer just to have one MasterCard and one Visa"
Uh-huh.
and that's it.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
Actually I pay off my cards every month.
Only once in my life have I not paid.
"I think that's a really good way to handle it, because that way, if you, if you paid off every month, you never have to worry about, well, how much do I have to pay these guys, you know, this month, you know."
"This, you buy what you can afford."
I mean if you handle it just like you would like a check or cash it's a lot easier to keep it in check.
Right.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"Well, and also in a sense, they're giving you a loan for a month"
"so that you know, if I were smarter, I would have that same amount in savings and get the interest, which I don't do,"
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
"but, but yeah,"
"the, the thought of adding, you know, X percent to, to the price of what I buy, I just, I can't accept."

She became a child prostitute at the age of 12 while she was staying at a group home and an older girl there persuaded her to become a runaway in order to sell sex to a pedophile named Charlie. She had a son, Tanner, who developed cancer as an infant and died at the age of five with the dying wish that his mother get out of the sex industry. In 2000, she moved to Toronto from Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada. She is the stepmother of Angel, whose biological mother was Brenda Wolfe, one of Robert Pickton's murder victims. In 2009, Perrier accompanied Angel at Toronto's Native Women's Resource Centre for the Sisters in Spirit vigil in remembrance of Wolfe and the other more than 500 Canadian Aboriginal women who have been murdered or gone missing over the past 30 years. In 2010, Perrier picketed a courthouse in downtown Toronto in recognition of International Day of No Prostitution. She was joined by Trisha Baptie, Natasha Falle, Katarina MacLeod, and Christine Barkhouse, all former human trafficking victims. In 2012, after being removed from a news conference relating to ""Bedford v. Canada"", Perrier demonstrated a pimp stick to the media, saying that she had been battered with a pimp stick by her pimp every day that he prostituted her. Perrier opposed the legalization of brothels as proposed in ""Bedford v. Canada"", saying, ""Having a legal bawdy house is not going to make it any safer. You are still going to attract serial killers, rapists, perverts."" Bridget shared her story in the ground breaking article by Dr. Vincent J.

"The Historic Columbia River Highway runs over the dell on a bridge that was the answer to one of the engineering challenges of the highway's construction. The dell was carved by a creek that includes two fairly substantial tumbling waterfalls. Due to the topography of the area, it is difficult to photograph the falls. As such, the bridge is what is normally pictured, and thus is arguably better known than the dell itself."
"The spelling of the dell's name tends to vary depending on the source. The official Oregon State Park site spells it with the apostrophe, however the GNIS entry omits the apostrophe. Oregon Geographic Names appears to make a distinction between the name of the geographic feature and the name of the state park (now a state natural area), referring to both Shepperds Dell and Shepperd's Dell State Park. Omitting the apostrophe when referring to the dell itself is consistent with the policies of the United States Board on Geographic Names, which strongly discourages the use of possessive apostrophes in geographic names."

"Gabriele Eckart (born March 23, 1954 in Falkenstein/Vogtland), is a German author."
"Gabriele Eckart studied Philosophy from 1972 to 1976 at the Humboldt University of Berlin. She concluded her studies with the completion of her Staatsexamen. In 1979 she took part in a writing course at the German Literature Institute in Leipzig. After publishing two collections of her own poetry and a collection of travel memoirs, her next publication was supposed to have been a collection of interviews with people in Havelland. Small excerpts appeared in 1983 and 1984 in literature magazines in the German Democratic Republic, but the publication of the entire text, which contained numerous passages critical of relations in the German Democratic Republic, was prevented by government censorship. The book ""So sehe ick die Sache"" was therefore published openly only in West Germany."
"In 1987, Eckart used a visit to the Frankfurter Buchmesse to relocate to the Federal Republic of Germany; she remained, however, a citizen of the German Democratic Republic. In 1988 she emigrated to the United States, where she continued her studies. In 1993 she earned her Master of Arts at the University of Texas at San Antonio, and her PhD from the University of Minnesota. She has worked as a Professor of German and Spanish at the Southeast Missouri State University in Cape Girardeau."

It is part of the Gainesville TX-Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is in turn part of the Dallas-Fort Worth, TX-OK Combined Statistical Area."
The Woodbine Formation is a Cretaceous geologic formation named for the small community in 1905.
"Settlement of the area known as Mineola began back in the 1840s, but the first residents did not become permanent until the mid-1860s. In 1879, the Denison and Pacific Railroad came through, and the community was renamed Woodbine for the abundant vines in the area. Its railroad depot was the first in Cooke County, and the community prospered from it. The same year, Woodbine received a post office that would exist until the Great Depression of the 1930s. By 1900, Woodbine's population was 100, though this figure declined by half by 1940. In 1950, Woodbine had 20 residents. Only its proximity to Gainesville prevented it from disappearing altogether, with a resurgence of population wanting to live outside the city."

= = = William G. Greene = = =
"William G. ""Slicky Bill"" Greene, Jr. (1812–1894) was a friend of Abraham Lincoln and a businessman in Menard County, Illinois. Greene founded Tallula, Illinois in 1857, and Greenview, Illinois is named after him."
"Greene, along with his brother L.M. Greene, and William F. Berry, attended Illinois College in Jacksonville."
"By September 1831, Greene's parents lived 2 miles (3 km) southwest of New Salem; Greene, then age 19, was hired by recent arrival Abraham Lincoln to assist at Lincoln's mill and store. In early January 1833, Greene bought the inventory of Reuben Radford's store in New Salem for $400; Lincoln drew up and witnessed the mortgage. The same day, Greene sold the same inventory to Lincoln and Berry, now Lincoln's store partner, for over $600. When Lincoln had a debt judgement entered against him in 1834, requiring Lincoln to surrender his horse, Greene turned in his own horse instead; this horse was probably the one Lincoln had paid him with in 1833. Lincoln eventually paid Greene back after becoming an attorney."
"Greene was also an acquaintance of Richard Yates, and introduced Yates and Lincoln in New Salem; Yates became Governor of Illinois during the Civil War and Lincoln became President."
"Greene and Lincoln remained friends; though Greene was a Democrat, Lincoln, as president, appointed Greene as internal revenue collector for the Peoria district. In ""Lincoln's New Salem"", author Benjamin Thomas relates a story in which Lincoln introduced Greene to Secretary of State William H. Seward by saying that Greene had taught Lincoln grammar: When Greene later reminded Lincoln that all Greene had done was held the grammar book and checked the answers, and was not very good at grammar himself, Lincoln is said to have replied ""Well, that was all the teaching of grammar I ever had."""
"Greene had nine children. By March 1853, Greene and his wife, Louisa Green, lived on a farm near Havana, Illinois; their seventh child, Gaines Greene (1853–1918), was born there on March 3. Sons Carlin, McNult, Byrd, and Vance, and daughter Julia Greene, died before Gaines; sons Scott and Frank and daughter J. S. Noble outlived Gaines."
"Within months after the birth of Gaines Green, the family moved near Tallula, and William Greene spent most of his life in Tallula Precinct. Greene, along with Yates, J. G. Greene, T. Baker, and W. G. Spears, laid out the village of Tallula itself in late 1857. William Greene and physician J. F. Wilson established the local bank in May 1877."
"Greenview was laid out in October 1857. It was named after William Greene because he convinced the railroad to come through the town: located on the Chicago, Alton & St. Louis Railroad, Greenview was incorporated by a special act of the Illinois General Assembly in May 1869."
"Greene died on June 30, 1894, aged 82 years, 5 months, 3 days, and is buried as ""W. G. Greene"" in Greenwood Cemetery (East) in Tallula."

Veiss being appointed Chief of the Auxiliary Police. At the end of 1941, he became First Deputy Director General of the Director General of the Interior when the Latvian Self-Administration was reorganized."
"As early as autumn 1941 Latvian auxiliary police units, temporarily attached to the Wehrmacht, were first used in front line duties. This occasional employment continued until the 2nd Latvian Brigade was formed from six Latvian battalions, four of which had combat experience. At the end of April 1943 a three battalion formation fighting under name of Latvian Legion was withdrawn from the front line and renamed 1st Volunteer Regiment of the SS (Latvian), with a change of Wehrmacht ranks to those of Waffen-SS. Voldemārs Veiss was given command of this regiment, which was a part of the 2nd Latvian Brigade, and received a rank of Legion-Obersturmbannführer.

= = = Biosphere reserves in Singapore = = =
"The Singaporean government has established some five biosphere reserves in Singapore. There are namely: Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, Central Catchment Nature Reserve, Chek Jawa, Labrador Nature Reserve, and Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve."
"One of the first notions of biosphere reserves in Singapore was thought up by the then-Singapore Botanical Gardens Supritendent N. C. Cantley who, in 1882, proposed that select areas of land be preserved. In as early as 1883, the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve (as it is now known) was established, making it the inaugural biosphere reserve in Singapore. The Singapore Nature Reserves Act officially came into action in 1971. In 1984, biosphere reserves took up some of the country's land. This figure has been increased to , as of 2009."
"The Public Utilities Board-maintained Central Catchment Nature Reserve is Singapore's largest biosphere reserve. The Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve aids in the conservation of both bird species and mangrove plants. The Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, albeit small-sized at , hosts myriad plant and animal lifeforms. Chek Jawa is situated in eastern Pulau Ubin. Teeming with various kinds of marine life, Chek Jawa was ""discovered"" (much publicised) in 2001. The Labrador Nature Reserve is located by the sea. Described as ""an oasis of tranquility and natural wonders"", it teems with vast animal life, as well as plant life by the cliff. The large Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve comprises mostly wetland and a few bird species, most notably the shorebird, can be spotted there. It is cited as the ""first wetlands reserve to be gazetted in Singapore""."
"Owing to rapid urban development, the country is in need of more land for things such as housing, which is deemed more important than nature reservation. One possible issue faced by the biosphere reserves in Singapore is that they will be turned into nothingness by the government when the need arises. There was an instance when the government had wanted to reclaim part of Chek Jawa, but this was opposed by conservationists and it was ultimately not reclaimed."

"The Hayes Manufacturing Company Limited was a Vancouver-based Canadian manufacturer of heavy trucks known for their durability and a revolving bunk system. Founded in 1920, Hayes built both highway and off-road trucks, particularly for the logging industry. On a smaller scale, Hayes also manufactured buses. The Signal Company acquired a controlling stake in the company in 1969, and in 1971 renamed it Hayes Trucks. In 1975, Signal sold the company to Paccar, which closed the Hayes plants."
"The British Columbia company was established in 1920 by Douglas Hayes, a parts dealer, and partner W. Anderson from Quadra Island, and was originally the Hayes-Anderson Motor Company Ltd. It was renamed Hayes Manufacturing Company Ltd. in 1928, when the company built a large factory on the False Creek flats in Vancouver. The company eventually had over 600 employees and three plants."
"Along with trucks, Hayes manufactured buses, moving vans, tractors and trailers. Its few bus models included the Hayes ""Teardrop"", a very streamlined design introduced in 1936. Several Teardrop buses were purchased by Pacific Stage Lines, one of which has been preserved by the Transit Museum Society."
"The truck hood ornament was a die-cast, chrome-plated, 5-pound bear or a bronze cast bear. The chrome bear was found on the clippers and the bronze was off the square nose logger with butterfly wings. There was also a small bear ornament on each door."
"The Signal Company, the parent firm of Mack Trucks, acquired a controlling share in Hayes Manufacturing in 1969. The company was renamed Hayes Trucks in 1971. In 1975, Signal sold the company to Paccar, which closed the Hayes plants."
"In addition to operating the truck company, the founder's son, Donald Hayes, continued and expanded family logging operations, establishing Hayes Forest Services Limited in 1956. In 2006, Donald P. Hayes, President, and grandson of the founder, proudly accepted the award for being one of Canada's 50 Best Managed Companies - Public or Private."
= = = Aldgisl = = =
"Aldegisel, Aldegisl, Aldgillis, Aldgisl, Aldgils or Eadgils (fl. c. 678) was the ruler of Frisia (as king or duke) in the late seventh century contemporarily with Dagobert II and a very obscure figure. All that is known of him is in relation to the famous saint that he harboured and protected, Wilfrid, but he is the first historically verifiable ruler of the Frisians. What the exact title of the Frisian rulers was depends on the source. Frankish sources tend to call them dukes; other sources often call them kings."
"Wilfrid, deposed from his Archdiocese of York, exiled from Northumbria and on his way to Rome to seek papal support, landed in Frisia in 678. and was warmly received by Aldegisel, who entertained him for several months over the winter, probably at Utrecht. According to Stephen of Ripon, Wilfrid's biographer, Aldegisel encouraged Wilfrid in his effective evangelism and ""[the Frisians] accepted his [Wilfrid's] teaching and with a few exceptions all the chiefs were baptised by him in the name of the Lord, as well as many thousands of common people."" It is possible that Aldegisel was one of the early converts. However, it has been doubted whether Wilfrid was actually successful in Frisia, since there is no other evidence of the success of Christianity there before the work of Willibrord."
"While Wilfrid was at Aldegisel's court, the Frankish mayor of the palace, Ebroin, offered a bushel of gold coins in return for Wilfrid, alive or dead. Aldegisel himself is said to have torn up and burned the letter from the Frankish mayor in front of the ambassadors and his household. It has been surmised by some that Aldegisel's kindness to Wilfrid was a mode of defiance of Frankish domination. His successor and possibly son was Radbod, who followed the older pagan ways and was an enemy of Charles Martel."

"In the language of probability theory, formula_3 is asymptotically the expected length of the longest cycle in a uniformly distributed random permutation of a set of size ""n""."
"In number theory, the Golomb–Dickman constant appears in connection with the average size of the largest prime factor of an integer. More precisely,"
"where formula_5 is the largest prime factor of ""k"". So if ""k"" is a ""d"" digit integer, then formula_6 is the asymptotic average number of digits of the largest prime factor of ""k""."
The Golomb–Dickman constant appears in number theory in a different way. What is the
"probability that second largest prime factor of ""n"" is smaller than the square root of the largest prime factor of ""n""? Asymptotically, this probability is formula_7."
"More precisely,"
"where formula_9 is the second largest prime factor ""n""."
"The Golomb-Dickman constant also arises when we consider the average length of the largest cycle of any function from a finite set to itself. If ""X"" is a finite set, if we repeatedly apply a function ""f"": ""X"" → ""X"" to any element ""x"" of this set, it eventually enters a cycle, meaning that for some ""k"" we have formula_10 for sufficiently large ""n""; the smallest ""k"" with this property is the length of the cycle. Let ""b"" be the average, taken over all functions from a set of size ""n"" to itself, of the length of the largest cycle. Then Purdom and Williams proved that"
There are several expressions for formula_7. These include:

= = = Port of Salem = = =
"The Port of Salem is a shallow-draft port in the vicinity of the Salem River Cut-Off on the Salem River in Salem, New Jersey in the United States about east of the Delaware River and about from the Atlantic Ocean. It was re-designated a port of entry in 1984 and became a foreign trade zone (FTZ) in 1987. Transloading operations include the handling of a variety of bulk cargo, notably of construction aggregate, break bulk cargo, and containers for clothing, fishing apparel, agricultural produce, and other consumer goods, and has at times involved lighterage. It is operated under the auspices of the South Jersey Port Corporation."
"The Delaware River estuary was the territory of the Lenape. European settlement of the region around today's Salem began in 1638 when the colony of New Sweden was established and the Salem River was called Varkens Kill or Hogg Creek. Tradition holds that ethnic Finns settled inland from Finns Point in 1638. In 1641, a group from the New Haven Colony settled around Varkens Kill. In 1655, it was re-claimed by New Netherland and in 1664 it became part of the Province of New Jersey. In 1675, a land patent was given to John Fenwick, who founded the town. Originally, Salem's wharves were located along Fenwick Creek and Salem Creek, and received calls from Philadelphia, Boston and the Caribbean. During the American Revolutionary War, it was occupied by the British to prevent supplies from reaching American troops. Steamer service between Salem and Philadelphia began in 1825. The Salem Railroad opened in 1863."
"The Salem River Cut-off, which bypasses a large bend in the river at the port, was authorized in 1925. For much of the 20th century, the waterfront along the Salem River Cut-off and Fenwick Creek was dominated by industries centered around glass manufacturing, food processing, and mineral/oil storage. From 1905 to 1978, H. J. Heinz Company operated a large processing plant along Fenwick Creek. Mannington Mills, Anchor Glass, and AluChem are located proximate to the port, as well as the South Jersey Farmers Exchange in nearby Woodstown."
Salem was originally designated a port of entry in 1682 by royal commission of the British Crown.
"The City of Salem established a municipal port authority in 1982. In 1984, the port resumed international shipping operations and the United States Customs Service granted it status as a ""water port of entry"", the first such designation made since the 1930s. It is now a port of entry in United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) District 21, which is headquartered in Newark and covers New Jersey."
"Along with Millville Municipal Airport, portions of the port have been part of foreign trade zone #142 since 1987. Subzones associated with FTZ142 are located at the Port of Paulsboro and other locations in South Jersey."
"The Delaware and Salem rivers are tidal. The Delaware River Main Channel has been maintained at a depth of . Dredging to a depth of was completed in 2017. Reach C, which includes the entrance to the Salem Port, was completed in 2010. The shipping channel of the Salem River is much shallower, making the city a shallow draft port, which prohibits use by Handymax class ships. The Salem River and Cut-Off were first channelized in 1925 to a depth of . The river is entered though Salem Cove about from the Atlantic Ocean at the entrance of the Delaware Bay. The channel travels along the southeast side of the cove for and continues another to the Cut-Off and to the head of navigation at the first bridge crossing (Route 49)."
"The Delaware River is served by various range lights. Reedy Island is approximately southwest of the mouth of the Salem River. Reedy Island Front Light works in conjunction with the Reedy Island Range Rear Light for navigation of the Salem reach of the river. The Finns Point Range Light upstream of the Salem River was deactivated in 1950. From the Delaware River, entrance to the port is guided by the Salem River Range Lights, the Salem River Directional Light (), and 11 other lighted navigational aids."
"The city and county of Salem have a long history of glass manufacturing, along with the site of the first successful glass production facility in North America. Adjacent to the port is the oldest manufacturing facility for glass containers in the United States, established in 1863 and long known as Anchor Glass, once owned by Anchor Hocking and now part of the Ardagh Group."
"The rail line serving the port is called the Glass House Running Track and is an extension of the Salem Branch. On the verge of abandonment by Conrail, the southern section of the route from Swedesboro to Salem was purchased by the county in 1983 and is leased to Southern Railroad of New Jersey (SRNJ). Long neglected, it is in poor condition and travel speeds are very slow. The line is undergoing upgrades to the rail bed, trackage, a trestle at Oldman's Creek, and other work. At Swedesboro, SRNJ interchanges with Conrail Shared Assets Operations to reach Pavonia Yard, the regional rail center."
"Route 45 and Route 49 provide access to Interstate 295, the New Jersey Turnpike and the nearby Delaware Memorial Bridge. In 2005, the Route 49 bascule bridge built in 1927 over the Salem River was replaced with a fixed bridge that can be converted to a vertical lift bridge and has been dedicated the ""Veteran’s of Salem County Memorial Bridge""."
"The Salem Municipal Port Authority was established in 1982 with the intention to revitalize and coordinate shipping in the port district. In 2005, the Salem City Industrial District Brownfield Development Area was created to spur re-use of brownfields, including numerous properties within and adjacent to the port district, which is located along the southern banks of the river between the Salem River Cut-Off and the Route 49 bridge just outside the downtown area. It encompasses several terminal and wharf facilities for barges and container ships for bulk and break bulk cargo, and shipping containers."
"In 2006, the municipal port authority described the typical container ship making use of the port as carrying 150 containers and taking approximately 12 hours to unload and reload. The ""Bermuda Islander"", a Dutch-flagged container ship, calls regularly at Salem."
"Mitsubishi MCA stands for Mitsubishi Clean Air, a moniker used in Japan to identify vehicles built with emission control technology. The term was first introduced in Japan, with later introductions internationally. The technology first appeared in January 1973 on the Mitsubishi 4G32A gasoline-powered inline four cylinder engine installed in all Mitsubishi vehicles using the 4G32 engine, and the Saturn-6 6G34 six-cylinder gasoline-powered engine installed in the Mitsubishi Debonair. The technology was installed so that their vehicles would be in compliance with Japanese Government emission regulations passed in 1968."
"Emission reducing technology began with the installation of a positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) valve (MCA-I), followed by the addition of a thermo reactor air pump and catalytic converter in addition to an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve (MCA-II) and a solenoid controlled automatic choke installed on the carburetor."
"The MCA-Jet system has a small third valve separate from the intake and exhaust valves. Separate passages in the intake manifold feed each MCA-Jet valve. Since these passages are smaller than the main intake manifold passages, the air/fuel mixture must move faster. When the faster moving air/fuel mixture from the MCA-Jet valve hits the slower moving air/fuel mixture from the intake valve, a strong air swirling effect occurs that promotes more complete combustion. With MCA-Jet it was found that stable combustion could be obtained even with large amounts of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), NOx could be reduced, and combustion improved. Honda's CVCC Stratified charge engine approach also used a small third valve, but sent a richer air/fuel mixture to a small pre-combustion chamber near the spark plug, to help ignite a leaner air/fuel mixture in the main combustion chamber. MCA-Jet was a simpler system that sent the same air/fuel mixture to all intake and MCA-Jet valves. Each MCA-Jet valve is quite small and may be prone to carbon build-up, causing the MCA-Jet valve(s) to stick open. If a Mitsubishi-designed engine has low compression, the MCA-Jet valve(s) could be the cause. Each MCA-Jet valve and valve seat are a self-contained cylinder-shaped unit that screws into the cylinder head for easy replacement. Aftermarket MCA-Jet valves are available. With the advent of 4-valve-per-cylinder engines, manufacturers typically design the camshaft(s) to open one intake valve slightly before the other to create a swirling effect. This has made the MCA-Jet system obsolete. The MCA-Jet system was used in certain Mitsubishi-designed engines installed in both Mitsubishi-branded and Chrysler/Dodge/Plymouth-branded vehicles during the late 1970s to late 1980s."

"Gawain Garth Fagan, CD (born 3 May 1940) is a Jamaican modern dance choreographer. He is the founder and artistic director of Garth Fagan Dance, a modern dance company based in Rochester, New York."
"Fagan was born in Kingston, Jamaica to Oxford educated S.W. Fagan, former Chief Education Officer of Jamaica, and Louise I. Walker. It was a gymnastics class that initially drew his attention to dance early on. While attending Excelsior High school, he studied with Ivy Baxter at the Jamaica National Dance Company and performed at the inauguration of Cuban President Fidel Castro in 1959. Fagan was educated at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree with sights on becoming a psychologist."
"Fagan worked at several dance companies in Detroit, and moved to Rochester New York in 1970, and there established his dance company originally named the ""Bottom of the Bucket BUT ... Dance Theatre"" in 1970. He was a Professor, at State University of New York, Brockport starting in 1970. Fagan choreographed for the Dance Theatre of Harlem, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, and the Limón Dance Company in the 1970s. He has studied the works of Isadora Duncan, Martha Graham, Pearl Primus, Alvin Ailey, José Limón, and Katherine Dunham. He is also influenced by Caribbean and West African dances."
"Fagan's choreography incorporates elements of modern dance, ballet, Afro-Caribbean dance, and social dance. Many of his works are autobiographical or include themes of personal relevance. His untitled 1977 work chronicles the dissolution of his marriage, showing a couple beginning a relationship with affection and passion but eventually drifting apart due to inevitable obstacles. ""Griot New York,"" which premiered in 1991 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, is about the experiences of the underprivileged living in New York City. The piece juxtaposes linear balletic movement with sharp angular gestures, twitching, and erotic partnering to represent the diversity and contrast found in big cities as well as conflict in his own life. In ""Moth Dreams,"" choreographed in 1992, Fagan celebrates his childhood, adolescence, and relationship with his mother."
"Fagan resides in Rochester, New York, is now divorced, and has two children."
"Fagan is a Distinguished University Professor at the State University of New York at Brockport. He has a Bachelor of Arts from Wayne State University, and earned a Doctor of Fine Arts from the University of Rochester in 1986, and holds ""honoris causa"" Doctors degrees from Juilliard School, Hobart College, William Smith College, and Nazareth College."
"Fagan received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1998, and a three-year Choreography Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts. He was made Commander in the Order of Distinction of Jamaica in August 2001, and was presented the Prime Minister's Award by Jamaican Prime Minister P. J. Patterson ."
In 2005 he received the Artist of the Year Award from the Arts & Cultural Council for Greater Rochester.

It stands in of parkland which includes one of the two privately owned deer parks to remain in Shropshire and is notable for its population of red kites.
"The estate is mentioned in the Domesday Book. The core of the present house dates from the 17th century, though significant remodelling was carried out throughout the 19th century. The ruins of an earlier castle, built in 1340, survive in the grounds."
"The north front was built in 1712 by Sir Edward Leighton, 2nd Baronet, who moved his family seat here from Wattlesborough Castle, and was High Sheriff of Shropshire for 1727. In 1805, the 5th Baronet entertained the Prince Regent and the Duke of Clarence at Loton. Sir Baldwin Leighton, 6th Baronet was wounded in the American War of Independence, was a Brigadier in Portugal and Governor of Carrickfergus Castle."

"Lewis Archer Boswell (May 9, 1834 – November 26, 1909) was an early aviation pioneer who some believe made the first powered heavier-than-air flight, before the Wright Brothers."
"Born May 9, 1834 in Lunenburg County, Virginia, Boswell went to study at Thomas Jefferson University and later Johns Hopkins University, earning his medical degree. During the Civil War, he worked as a Confederate surgeon in Richmond, Virginia."
"In 1868 Boswell began experimenting in aeronautics, but supposedly threw his small model into the Yazoo River that same year. It is unknown why he did this, although speculation points to the purpose of hiding his plans or ending local ridicule. He moved to Eastaboga, Alabama in 1869 with his new wife, where he was granted a patent for an in 1874."
"While he continued his study until his death on November 26, 1909, it is unknown if he ever built a full-scale model and attempted flight. In 1900, he wrote a letter to the Secretary of War, asking for funding and promising results, but it was rejected. Locals in his area have made claims that he actually did fly in November 1902, beating the Wright Brothers by a year. In fact, at the time of his death, Boswell was pursuing lawsuit against them, but this action was never carried through by his estate. Other stories tell that he made a short flight after being rolled off a barn roof back in the mid-1890s. However, no conclusive proof has surfaced to support these claims."
"In 2002, the local airport in Talladega, Alabama was renamed Boswell Field in honor of the local aviator, and according to the Airport Board Chairman, if Boswell made the first heavier than air flight, that would make Boswell Field the first airport."

"Garden State is the soundtrack album to the film ""Garden State"". Compilation producer Zach Braff was awarded a Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack Album for Motion Pictures, Television or Other Visual Media for his work on the album."
"The music that accompanied the film was hand-picked by Zach Braff. Commenting on the selections, Braff said that"
"The music in the film features a number of indie-rock artists, notably the Shins. In an early scene, Sam passes Andrew a headset which is playing the song ""New Slang"" by the Shins as she says ""You gotta hear this one song — it’ll change your life; I swear."" A second Shins song, ""Caring Is Creepy"", is also featured on the soundtrack. The presence of Simon & Garfunkel's ""The Only Living Boy in New York"" on the soundtrack has been cited by some as evidence of a connection to ""The Graduate""."
"The song ""Orange Sky"" by Alexi Murdoch was also featured in the movie, but did not appear on the soundtrack, as the rights to the song were owned by Fox's ""The O.C."" It was played between ""New Slang"" and ""I Just Don't Think I'll Ever Get Over You"" in the film. Additionally, ""Love Will Come Through"" by Travis was used in the film’s trailer, but never made it into the film or onto its soundtrack. The trailer also featured ""Such Great Heights"" in the original version by the Postal Service rather than the Iron & Wine cover used in the film. The song ""Chocolate"" by Snow Patrol appeared in the commercials but didn't appear on the soundtrack. The song ""Adelita"" by Francisco Tárrega was played on guitar by Peter Sarsgaard when he was talking to Zach Braff in his room, and played on the video of Sam ice skating in the alligator costume. Also, ""Three Times A Lady"" by Lionel Richie is sung during the funeral scene. Neither song appears on the soundtrack. Additional instrumental composition by Chad Fischer ""Motorcycle Ride with Sam"" was featured in the DVD menu."

The album has sold over 1.3 million copies and has been certified as platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.
"In an episode of ""Saturday Night Live"" hosted by Braff, Braff plays a high school student in a skit where various high school interest groups are attempting to select a theme for the upcoming senior prom. Braff’s character suggests a ""Garden State"" theme because the soundtrack ""changed [his] life"", but the prom committee describes it as a ""Pitchfork mix CD"". Braff's character replies that he happens to know ""...those songs were very carefully ""chosen""""'; nevertheless, the idea is quickly dismissed.

= = = Darwin (programming game) = = =
"Darwin was a programming game invented in August 1961 by Victor A. Vyssotsky, Robert Morris Sr., and M. Douglas McIlroy. (Dennis Ritchie is sometimes incorrectly cited as a co-author, but was not involved.) The game was developed at Bell Labs, and played on an IBM 7090 mainframe there. The game was only played for a few weeks before Morris developed an ""ultimate"" program that eventually brought the game to an end, as no-one managed to produce anything that could defeat it."
"The game consisted of a program called the ""umpire"" and a designated section of the computer's memory known as the ""arena"", into which two or more small programs, written by the players, were loaded. The programs were written in 7090 machine code, and could call a number of functions provided by the umpire in order to probe other locations within the arena, kill opposing programs, and claim vacant memory for copies of themselves."
"The game ended after a set amount of time, or when copies of only one program remained alive. The player who wrote the last surviving program was declared winner."
"Up to 20 memory locations within each program (fewer in later versions of the game) could be designated as ""protected"". If one of these protected locations was probed by another program, the umpire would immediately transfer control to the program that was probed. This program would then continue to execute until it, in turn, probed a protected location of some other program, and so forth."
"While the programs were responsible for copying and relocating themselves, they were forbidden from altering memory locations outside themselves without permission from the umpire. As the programs were executed directly by the computer, there was no physical mechanism in place to prevent cheating. Instead, the source code for the programs was made available for study after each game, allowing players to learn from each other and to verify that their opponents hadn't cheated."
"The smallest program that could reproduce, locate enemies and kill them consisted of about 30 instructions. McIlroy developed a 15-instruction program that could locate and kill enemies but not reproduce; while not very lethal, it was effectively unkillable, as it was shorter than the limit of 20 protected instructions. In later games the limit on protected instructions was lowered because of this."
"The ""ultimately lethal"" program developed by Morris had 44 instructions, and employed an adaptive strategy. Once it successfully located the start of an enemy program, it would probe some small distance ahead of this location. If it succeeded in killing the enemy, it would remember the distance and use it on subsequent encounters. If it instead hit a protected location, then the next time it gained control it chose a different distance. Any new copies were initialized with a successful value. In this way, Morris's program evolved into multiple subspecies, each specifically adapted to kill a particular enemy."

"The Upper Darling Range Railway (also known as the Upper Darling Range Branch) was a branch railway from Midland Junction, Western Australia, that rose up the southern side of the Helena Valley and on to the Darling Scarp via the Kalamunda Zig Zag. At the time of construction it was the only section of railway in Western Australia to have had a zig zag formation."
"Completed in July 1891, the Upper Darling Range Railway line was built by the Canning Jarrah Timber Company to supply railway sleepers to Perth's growing railway system. It ran from Midland Junction railway station through to the Darling Ranges and up into Kalamunda. It was later extended to Canning Mills and in 1912 to Karragullen. From Pickering Brook, a line branched off to Bartons Mill."
"On 1 July 1903, the line was taken over by the Western Australian Government Railways and became known as the Upper Darling Range Branch. The last service ran on 22 July 1949. The line was formally closed by the Railways (Upper Darling Range) Discontinuance Act 1950; it was dismantled in 1952."

"I am a defeated and ruined war captive, that's it! The former emperor [Taizong] treated me generously, but I betrayed him. In my present defeat, Heaven has vented its fury at me. In the past I have heard that Han law stipulates that executions of men be carried out in the city marketplace. When we arrive in the capital, I request to Zhaling [the tomb of the previous Tang emperor Taizong] to atone for my crimes to the former emperor. This is my sincere desire."
"Gaozong received Helu's plea and agreed to his request, despite a Tang law ordering the execution of captured rebel generals and kings. In accordance with Confucian rituals, he was sent to Taizong's tomb where Gaozong spared his life, and then to the capital's Ancestral Temple where the captive was presented again, mirroring ancient rituals celebrating victorious armies. Helu felt disgraced by Taizong and committed suicide a year later while still in captivity. He was buried in a mound decorated with a stele outside the emperor's park. The tomb served as a military trophy, visible to the emperor's visitors entering the park, symbolizing the loyalty of the qaghan to the emperor and the Tang military victories against the Western Turks."
"The conquest strengthened Tang rule over modern Xinjiang, administered by the Anxi Protectorate, and led to Tang suzerainty over the regions previously under the control of the Western Turks. The fall of the Khaganate brought the Altai Mountain region under Tang control and the residing Three Qarluq tribes were governed in newly established prefectures led by tribal chiefs, now commander-in-chiefs under the Tang. Another prefecture, the Jinman Bridle Prefecture, was created for the Chuyue tribes living in the southern Dzungar basin. The Amu Darya valley, the Tarim Basin, and the area beyond the Pamir Mountains, all former suzerains of the Western Turks, were placed under Tang control."
"Su continued his career as military general, and later commanded Tang forces in a war against Baekje in 660. The Tang Dynasty achieved its maximum extent following its conquest of the Khaganate. The inhabitants of the new territory did not become sinicized like many of the other kingdoms and tribes conquered by the Tang. Tang military activity in Central Asia brought in a wave of Turkic migrants serving in the Tang military as soldiers and generals, leading to the spread of Turkic language and culture. At the same time, the prevalence of Indo-European languages in the Western Regions was on the decline. Central Asia also absorbed cultural influences from Tang China. Central Asian art incorporated Tang stylistic features, like the sancai three color glaze used in pottery. Chinese coins remained in circulation in Xinjiang after the decline of the Tang. Cultural remnants of Tang architectural influence are still visible in the Buddhist architecture of Dunhuang, on the border between the Western Regions and the Hexi Corridor."
"The sheer size of the newly conquered lands made it difficult to govern through the Tang military garrisons. The Tang emperor Gaozong appointed two puppet qaghans to rule over the Western Turks, who were later overthrown in a rebellion that began in 662. The revolt reduced Tang's western extent to Beshbalik, Dzungaria in northern Xinjiang and ended direct Tang control of Central Asia beyond the Pamir Mountains in modern Tajikistan and Afghanistan. The expansion of the Tibetan Empire from the south threatened China's hold on southern Xinjiang. Tibet invaded the Tarim Basin in 670, but Tang forces regained the area in 693 and Kashgar in 728, restoring the Anxi Protectorate and Four Garrisons. The conflict between Tibet and the Tang continued for the remainder of the Tang Dynasty."
"At its maximum extent, Tang expansion brought China into direct contact with the rising Umayyad Caliphate. China's western borders reached the eastern frontier of the Caliphate. Following the Arab defeat of Sassanid Persia in 651, the Caliphate began its expansion into Central Asia, competing with the Tang's sphere of influence in the region. Chinese and Islamic troops finally clashed at the Battle of Aksu in 717 and the Battle of Talas in 751. Though victorious in 717, the Chinese lost against the Arabs, now under Abbasid rule, and the Arab army captured Chinese papermaking craftsmen. An Arabic record of the conflict claims that the battle led to the introduction of papermaking to the Islamic world."
"The Tang emperor Gaozong installed two puppet qaghans, the cousins Ashina Buzhen and Ashina Mishe, and controlled the region by proxy. Buzhen and Mishe were enemies of Helu who had aided Su Dingfang during his campaign against Helu and the Western Turkic Khaganate. Gaozong divided the ten tribes of the area among the two cousins. Buzhen governed half of the tribes located in the west, while Mishe governed the other half located in the east."
"The son of Buzhen, Khusrau, and the son of Mishe, Yuanqing, resided in Chang'an, the capital of Tang, while their fathers administered the former khaganate as qaghans. Empress Wu Zetian sent Yuanqing and Kusrau westward in 685 to succeed their fathers as proxy rulers."
"Neither of the qaghans were able to successfully exert control. Turkic tribes resisted Yuanqing's rule, defeating the qaghan and forcing Yuanqing to return to Chang'an. Kusrau was able to bring the western tribes temporarily under his rule, but was defeated in 690 during an invasion by the Second Turkic Khaganate, and he too was forced to escape the region with his loyalists. Later attempts to install puppet qaghans failed, and the title was reduced to a symbolic position in the Tang court."

"A distinctive feature of many Australasian trams was the ""drop-centre"", a lowered central section between bogies (wheel-sets), to make passenger access easier by reducing the number of steps required to get inside of the vehicle."
"Californian combination cars had an enclosed centre section, with open-sided sections at each end. Hong Kong or toast rack (toastrack) cars were open, with the roof supported by a row of stanchions on each side. Most electric trams were single-deck, but Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and initially Dunedin had some open-top double-deck trams. These were popular with courting couples! The Wellington Fiducia trams had access at each end only, with no separate middle section or centre doors."
"The Engineers of the Auckland Electric Tramway Company, BET Company designed their own tramcars, earlier models were built by Brush Engineering in Loughborough, construction post the Great War was exclusively by Auckland Coach Builders and increasingly the Tramway's own workshops at Royal Oak on Manukau Road. Rear entrance Dinghy ""A type"" four wheelers, and toast rack trams were trialled in the early years and a small number of C type double deckers used until the 1920s. The ""Combo"" or B type design pretty much laid the basic design of Auckland tram down from 1902. Entrances at either end, platform steps within the bodyline of the tramcar. The in-house design progression moved to the addition of windscreens, a separate Motorman's compartment from the M type in 1908 and a seat design and layout for 52 seated passengers that remained standard until closure in 1956. Dalliance with riveted steel construction with the Art Deco ""Semi-steel"" N type in the 1920s which included butterfly [double set] destinations set in a V shape which could be read even when trams were parked bumper to bumper, double set saloon doorways a return to traditional wooden construction with the 1929/30 Big Cars with minor improvements to seating design and finally the 1930s Streamliner design, which had curving pillar frames, 7'6"" over the chassis and 8' at the window sill level and reducing again to the roofline. The design change of the bodies was cosmetically pleasing, but still seated only 52 passengers on wooden seats. Six of the streamliners used EMB trucks imported from the UK, primarily where they were used under Double Deckers. The remainder used Brush Improved Trucks, a design little changed for 30 years which were the mainstay of the Auckland fleet."

"Set in 18th-century South Africa, the film dramatizes the true story of Claas Blank (Rouxnet Brown) and Rijkhaart Jacobsz (Neil Sandilands)."
"Herder Claas Blank was serving 10 years for ""insulting a Dutch citizen"" and Rijkhaart, was a Dutch sailor convicted of committing ""unnatural acts"" with another man. The two men initially hostile form a secret relationship, using trips to a private water-tank to bond. The two prisoners on Robben Island who were later executed for sodomy in 1735 by drowning, after jealousy of other inmates caused problems. Their relationship also had a racial component, as Jacobsz was a white Dutchman, while Blank was a black Khoi.

= = = Soybean oil = = =
"Soybean oil is a vegetable oil extracted from the seeds of the soybean (""Glycine max""). It is one of the most widely consumed cooking oils. As a drying oil, processed soybean oil is also used as a base for printing inks (soy ink) and oil paints."
Chinese records dating prior to 2000 B.C. mention use of cultivated soybeans to produce edible soy oil. Ancient Chinese literature reveals that soybeans were extensively cultivated and highly valued as a use for the soybean oil production process before written records were kept.
"To produce soybean oil, the soybeans are cracked, adjusted for moisture content, heated to between 60 and 88 °C (140–190 °F), rolled into flakes, and solvent-extracted with hexanes. The oil is then refined, blended for different applications, and sometimes hydrogenated. Soybean oils, both liquid and partially hydrogenated are sold as ""vegetable oil,"" or are ingredients in a wide variety of processed foods. Most of the remaining residue (soybean meal) is used as animal feed."
"In the 2002–2003 growing season, 30.6 million tons (MT) of soybean oil were produced worldwide, constituting about half of worldwide edible vegetable oil production, and thirty percent of all fats and oils produced, including animal fats and oils derived from tropical plants."
"In 2018-2019, world production was at 57.4 MT with the leading producers including China (16.6 MT), US (10.9 MT), Argentina (8.4 MT), Brazil (8.2 MT), and EU (3.2 MT)."
"Per 100 g, soybean oil has 16 g of saturated fat, 23 g of monounsaturated fat, and 58 g of polyunsaturated fat. The major unsaturated fatty acids in soybean oil triglycerides are the polyunsaturates alpha-linolenic acid (C-18:3), 7-10%, and linoleic acid (C-18:2), 51%; and the monounsaturate oleic acid (C-18:1), 23%. It also contains the saturated fatty acids stearic acid (C-18:0), 4%, and palmitic acid (C-16:0), 10%."
"The high-proportion of oxidation-prone polyunsaturated fatty acid is undesirable for some uses, such as cooking oils. Three companies, Monsanto Company, DuPont/Bunge, and Asoyia in 2004 introduced low linolenic Roundup Ready soybeans. Hydrogenation may be used to reduce the unsaturation in linolenic acid. The resulting oil is called hydrogenated soybean oil. If the hydrogenation is only partially complete, the oil may contain small amounts of trans fat."
Soybean oil is mostly used for frying and baking. It is also used as a condiment for salads.
"Soybean oil is one of many drying oils, which means that it will slowly harden (due to free-radical based polymerization) upon exposure to air, forming a flexible, transparent, and waterproof solid. Because of this property, it is used in some printing ink and oil paint formulations. However, other oils (such as linseed oil) may be superior for some drying oil applications."

= = = Jōkō Ninomiya = = =
"Joko Ninomiya was born on January 27, 1954, in Yawatahama, Shikoku, Japan. Ninomiya was the youngest of 10 brothers and sisters. His family owned and tended to several fruit orchards. To augment the family's income, his father also worked as a carpenter."
"In seventh grade, at age 12, Ninomiya began training in a Judo class taught by a teacher at his junior high school. He earned his first degree black belt by the end of eighth grade. After turning 14, Ninomiya did extra Judo training at the local police station gym on weekends and holidays. It was there that he met the man who would become his teacher and mentor in karate- Hideyuki Ashihara. One year later, in 1969, Ninomiya began training in Ashihara's Kyokushin dojo."
"Hideyuki Ashihara began training in Kyokushin karate at the honbu dojo in 1971 when he was 16 years old. Kyokushin(kai) is a full contact, knockdown style of karate founded by Mas Oyama. Ashihara attained first degree black belt in Kyokushin in 1974. Two years after that he became an instructor, and two years after that he was allowed to open his own dojo in Ninomiya's home town of Yawatahama."
"During this time, Ashihara was developing his own approach to the Kyokushin curriculum he was teaching his students as well as adding additional movements and techniques that he had devised. His techniques involved using circular patterns to move outside of an opponent's attack and then to counterattack from a position of advantage. These techniques also involved parries and sweeps intended to use the opponent's momentum against him. He always stressed getting the maximum impact from a minimum amount of force. Ashihara called these techniques, ""Sabaki."" Although many of these techniques were prohibited in Kyokushin Knockdown karate tournament rules, he taught them to his students, including Ninomiya, so that they would be more effective, all-around karate fighters. Many renowned karate students came to train at Ashihara's dojo because of his reputation as an extremely effective instructor."
"When Ninomiya was 17, he received his brown belt in Kyokushin from Ashihara and was chosen to compete in the All-Japan Tournament as the youngest competitor. He lost in the second round to eventual tournament champion Katsuaki Satō."
"Ninomiya trained hard for the next year's tournament, including spending three weeks living and training alone at a beach some distance from his home town. At his second All-Japan tournament in 1972 he lost in the third round to eventual tournament champion Miyuki Miura."
"During this time, Ninomiya had continued to train and compete in judo, as well as in karate. However, with graduation from high school, he stopped training in judo and trained full-time in karate, when not working in various jobs, including as a nightclub security guard. Ninomiya was now a 1st degree black belt in Kyokushin. At the 1973 All-Japan tournament, he lost again in the third round, this time to eventual tournament champion Hatsuo Royama."
"One month after the 1973 tournament, Ninomiya was chosen, along with five others, to go to live and train at the three Kyokushin dojo in New York City. Two of the American fighters that trained with them there were William Oliver and Willie Williams. The other five members of the group returned to Japan after two months, but Ninomiya stayed in New York to teach and train. Because of visa problems, he was unable to compete in the 1974 All-Japan tournament."
"In October, 1975, 21-year-old Joko Ninomiya returned to Japan to compete in the first All-World Tournament. In the semi-finals, he once again faced Katsuaki Satō. After a three-overtime match, Satō won the match by judge's decision. Satō then won the subsequent title match against Hatsuo Royama. Ninomiya finished in third place. The tournament was filmed for a documentary, called ""Fighting Black Kings"" that also profiled several of the competitors, including William Oliver and Willie Williams."
"Ninomiya returned to New York and prepared for the next year's All-Japan tournament. At the tournament, his quarter-final match went to three overtimes before he was awarded the decision. His semi-final match went two overtimes before he was again awarded the decision. Extremely fatigued, Ninomiya had only 10-minutes to rest and prepare for the final match against Toshikazu Satō which Satō won. Ninomiya returned to New York to resume teaching and training."
"Ninomiya was unable to compete in the 1977 All-Japan due to a training accident involving a sword that almost severed his left thumb. Instead, he decided to move to Denver to open his own Kyokushin dojo. His first classes were held in a neighborhood health club. However, he was subsequently able to rent a vacant store to use as a training dojo. He soon had a dedicated core of students."
"The next year, Ninomiya returned to Japan briefly for his father's funeral. Seven months later, he returned again for the 1978 All-Japan Tournament. In the final match, Ninomiya defeated Keiji Sanpei to win the All-Japan championship. He then retired from tournament competition to concentrate full-time on teaching karate."
"In 1980 Hideyuki Ashihara left the Kyokushin organization and started his own style- Ashihara Karate. Ninomiya directed the US region of Ashihara Karate from Denver. Over the next eight years, Ashihara Karate slowly increased in size in the US and around the world."
"During this time, Ninomiya states that he had developed strategies and ideas of his own that he was eager to implement in his training curriculum. He also wanted to develop his own tournament format that would provide what he felt to be a ""true"" test of karate skills. Therefore, in May, 1988, Ninomiya decided to leave Ashihara Karate and start his own style. Most of the instructors and students of Ashihara in the US decided to follow Ninomiya into his new organization Enshin kaikan, providing a strong base for the new style- Enshin Karate."
"Since 1988, Enshin Karate has continued to be headquartered at Ninomiya's honbu in Denver. The organization has grown and now includes schools in Asia, South America, Europe, Africa, Australia, and the Middle East, as well as in the US. Ninomiya's idea for an open, knockdown-rules tournament that promotes the Sabaki method became the Sabaki Challenge which has been held annually in Denver since 1989."
"Ninomiya travels extensively in his position as director of the Enshin organization. He attends the openings of new dojo, presides over Enshin sabaki tournaments, and conducts seminars on the sabaki method. When not traveling he trains and instructs at the honbu in Denver."
= = = Maqsood Ahmed = = =
"Maqsood Ahmed (26 March 1925 – 4 January 1999) was a Pakistani cricketer who played in 16 Test matches from 1952 to 1955. He was educated at Islamia College, Lahore."
"Maqsood Ahmed was a useful all rounder in the first ever cricket team of Pakistan. Before the creation of Pakistan, he played for Southern Punjab in India, scoring 144 in his very first match. An aggressive hitter of the ball, Maqsood played a vital role in the recognition of Pakistan as test playing nation when he made 137 against the visiting MCC in 1951–52."
"A right-handed middle-order batsman, Maqsood was a hard hitter of the ball and is one of the Test cricketers whose highest score was 99, which he made in the Third Test against India in 1954–55. Though a brilliant batsman, his performance in Test matches was rather irregular because of his carefree attitude. In England in 1952 he became the first Pakistani to play as a professional cricketer. The English press dubbed him ""Merry Max""."
"He played 16 Test matches, scoring a total of 507 runs. He was also a right-arm medium fast bowler with three wickets in test matches to his credit. His first-class record is better, with 3815 runs in 85 matches between 1945 and 1964, including six centuries. He also took 124 wickets, with 7 for 39 and 6 for 44 against Sargodha in 1962–63 his best bowling figures. He was the leading bowler in the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy in 1962–63 with 34 wickets at an average of 9.29. He captained Karachi Blues and Rawalpindi in the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy."
"After retiring from cricket, Maqsood Ahmed worked as a commentator and sports journalist for PTV, BBC and Radio Pakistan. He also served as the Chief National Cricket Coach and coached many Test stars including Intikhab Alam, Asif Iqbal, Mushtaq Mohammad, Sadiq Mohammad and Majid Khan. He was the Chairman of the National Selection Committee of the Pakistan Cricket Board which selected the World Cup winning team in 1991–92."
"Mu'in ad-Din Unur al-Atabeki (; died August 28, 1149) was the Turkish ruler of Damascus in the mid-12th century."
"Mu'in ad-Din was originally a Mameluk in the army of Toghtekin, the founder of the Burid Dynasty of Damascus. When Zengi, the atabeg of Aleppo, besieged Damascus in 1135, Mu'in ad-Din was at the head of army defending the city. That year the Burid Shihab ad-Din Mahmud took control of Damascus after the assassination of his brother; when Zengi gave up the siege and instead besieged Homs, Shihab ad-Din sent Yusuf ibn Firuz and Mu'in ad-Din to govern it, with Yusuf acting as Mu'in ad-Din's lieutenant. In 1137 Mu'in ad-Din was still governor of Homs when the city was briefly besieged again by Zengi. In 1138, Shihab ad-Din appointed Mu'in ad-Din atabeg of Damascus and gave him the title ""Isfahsaller"". Later in 1138, Zengi negotiated a marriage between himself and Shihab ad-Din's mother Khatun Safwat al-Mulk, and as part of the settlement Zengi received Homs. Mu'in ad-Din was given the castle of Barin in place of Homs. On June 22, 1139, Shihab ad-Din was assassinated in Damascus; Jamal ad-Din, emir of Baalbek, was chosen as his successor, and Mu'in ad-Din was chosen to govern Baalbek in his absence. He was in charge of the defenses of Baalbek when Zengi arrived to avenge the murder of his stepson. Zengi besieged it with 14 catapults and the city surrendered to him."
"In 1140 Jamal ad-Din died, and Mu'in ad-Din continued to rule as regent for Jamal ad-Din's son Mujir ad-Din. That year, Mu'in ad-Din besieged Banias with help from King Fulk of Jerusalem and Prince Raymond of Antioch; Mu'in ad-Din offered 20 000 pieces of gold per month to pay for their expenses. When it was captured, Mu'in ad-Din handed it over to Fulk and returned to Damascus. A more thorough alliance, to protect Damascus against Zengi, was negotiated during a visit by Mu'in ad-Din to Jerusalem, accompanied by the future chronicler Usamah ibn Munqidh."
"King Fulk died in 1143, and Zengi was assassinated in 1146. Zengi was succeeded by his sons Saif ad-Din Ghazi I in Mosul and Nur ad-Din in Aleppo, and Mu'in ad-Din took the opportunity to besiege Baalbek; the governor, Najm ad-Din Ayyub, father of Saladin, quickly surrendered to him. Mu'in ad-Din also asserted control over Homs and Hama, and sent Yarankash, the assassin of Zengi, to Nur ad-Din, after Yarankash sought refuge in Damascus."
"Mu'in ad-Din was always suspicious of Nur ad-Din's power, but it was his policy to remain on friendly terms with his neighbours wherever possible, whether they were Christian or Muslim. In 1147 Nur ad-Din and Mu'in ad-Din negotiated an alliance, in which Nur ad-Din married Mu'in ad-Din's daughter Ismat ad-Din Khatun. Having established peace with Aleppo, Mu'in ad-Din set out to besiege Salkhad and Bosra, after their governor, Altuntash, allied with Jerusalem against him. This broke Jerusalem's treaty with Damascus, forcing Mu'in ad-Din to turn to Nur ad-Din for assistance. Nur ad-Din arrived with the army of Aleppo, and the crusaders were forced to withdraw; both Bosra and Sarkhad then surrendered to Mu'in ad-Din. In August 1147 Mu'in ad-Din was formally recognized as governor of Damascus by the Caliph of Baghdad Al-Muqtafi and the Seljuk Sultan Mas'ud, and he was also recognized formally by the Fatimid Caliph in Egypt, al-Hafiz."
"In 1148 news reached Damascus of a new crusade, called in response to Zengi's capture of Edessa in 1145. Mu'in ad-Din prepared for the inevitable siege, although he had hoped his former alliance with Jerusalem could be restored and that the crusade would attack some other city. When the crusaders arrived in July, according to Ibn al-Qalanisi, Mu'in ad-Din ""distinguished himself in combat with them, and displayed a valour, steadfastness and gallantry such as was never seen in any other, never wearying in repelling them nor taking respite from the struggle against them."" Mu'in ad-Din reluctantly sent for help from Nur ad-Din and Saif-ad Din Ghazi, whose power he did not wish to see extend as far south as Damascus, and the crusaders besieged the city for only four days before withdrawing. It is possible that Mu'in ad-Din had bribed the crusaders to leave before Nur ad-Din arrived. After this success, the three emirs besieged the castle of Araima in the County of Tripoli, but Mu'in ad-Din was forced to acknowledge Nur ad-Din as his overlord."
"In 1149 Mu'in ad-Din led raids against crusader territory, in response to their raids against the territory of Damascus which they continued to make after the failure of their siege. He agreed to a two-year truce with King Baldwin III, and then joined with Nur ad-Din against the Principality of Antioch. Mu’in ad-Din patrolled the Hauran with his army while Nur ad-Din defeated Antioch at the Battle of Inab that year, in which Prince Raymond was killed."
"After returning to Damascus in July 1149, Mu'in ad-Din ""ate a hearty meal, as was his usual custom, and was seized thereafter by a loosening of the bowels...From this resulted in the disease known as dysentery..."" The emir died on August 28 and was buried in the university he had established in the city. As he had been acting as regent for Mujir ad-Din, the latter took his place as the rightful heir of Damascus. Mujir ad-Din was a weak ruler, however, and by 1154 Nur ad-Din was fully in control of the city and all of Syria."
"Mu'in ad-Din had three daughters, who married Nur ad-Din, Mujir ad-Din, and a soldier named Margar respectively. In addition to Ibn al-Qalanisi's favourable depiction of him, the Christian chronicler William of Tyre also speaks very highly of Mu'in ad-Din: he showed ""sincere fidelity"" in his negotiations with the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and was ""a man of much wisdom and a lover of our people."" William of Tyre rendered his names in Latin as ""Meheneddin"" for Mu'in ad-Din and ""Anardus"" for Unur."

"Miles & More is the largest traveller loyalty programme in Europe with 25 million members as of March 2014. It offers rewards to passengers of the Star Alliance travelling on certain types of tickets. The programme was launched by Lufthansa (LH) in 1993 and has about 40 airline partners, including the 28 airlines of the Star Alliance. The programme enables its members to earn and redeem frequent flyer miles on all of the fully integrated airlines, all Star Alliance members as well as several other partner airlines. Furthermore, there are more than 270 non-aviation companies affiliated with the programme. These include partners from the hotel, car rental & cruise industries, subscriptions & books, banks & insurance, telecommunications & electronics industries as well as shopping & lifestyle. Customers are able to build status, which gives them access to certain privileges. Miles & More is free of charge."
The following airlines are partners of the Miles & More program:
There are two types of miles within the programme.
"These are miles that can be collected in the account of a member and be used to buy flights, upgrades, merchandise from the Lufthansa WorldShop and other Miles & More partners. For standard Miles & More members they retain validity for 36 months, after which they expire. (Miles are not extended by having any activity on the account as with most other airlines). For Frequent Travellers, Senators and HON Circle Card holders, the miles have no expiration date. However, as soon as a customer does not hold any of these cards any more, the expiration date of all miles is set to 36 months counting from loss of frequent flyer status. For Miles & More Credit Card (Visa or MasterCard) holders issued in several countries, miles have no expiration date as long as the card is held and/or used. If the credit card contract is ended, the original expiry date of the miles is reinstated; although the earliest miles can expire is at the end of the quarter after the credit card contract is ended."
"Status miles can only be earned when flying on the fully integrated partner airlines or on Star Alliance members. There is no other way to earn these miles. In addition, status miles expire at the end of each calendar year. They are used to identify the frequent flyers and members that are able to qualify for a higher status on the basis of the status miles that they have collected in one year."
"Select benefits are advantages that can be earned in addition to the status benefits, as part of the programme called Miles & More Selections while the status is still valid. Once the member has reached specified mileage levels by flying, additional advantages can be selected. With every mileage level reached the range of select benefits increases. The selection of the select benefits varies from the status the member has. The select benefits for Frequent Travellers e.g. include business lounge vouchers, e-vouchers or mile exchange, the ones for Senators a Hilton Gold Membership, in addition. For HON circle members additional benefits such as coupons up to a value of 100 Euro as well as additional Senator partner cards are available."
"HON Circle miles can only be earned when flying in business or first class on the fully integrated partner airlines and Air-Rail trains in Germany (up to a total of 600,000 miles within two consecutive calendar years).

"The Global Change Award, is an innovation challenge created by the H&M foundation. It created a trend report in 2017 to look at the future of sustainable fashion. Five ""megatrends"" are identified by the organisation that will lead the future of sustainable fashion. The first ""megatrend"" is ""Power of Nature"" which is the industry looking into materials that have always been looked at as waste as a more sustainable method to making new clothing. The materials that will mitigate negative impacts from the industry include vegan materials from the earth and recycling old fabric into new clothing. The second ""megatrend"" is ""Rent a Closet""; this initiative has been around for a while. This trend ultimately lowers the new purchase of clothing and disposal of clothing, which means less waste. Rent the Runway is an example of the ""Rent a Closet"" trend. Rent the Runway started as a company that would give luxury brands like Hervé Leger, Vera Wang, Etro to people who may not be able to afford the clothing at regular retail price. Renting and sharing clothing is also known as CFC (collaborative fashion consumption) a sustainable fashion trend consumers are getting involved in. The third trend is ""Long Live Fashion"" is the revival of Vintage clothing. Vintage clothing is a way to lower the amount of clothing that gets disposed of and ends up in landfills. Companies like RE/DONE, Vintage Twin and Frankie Collective sell re-paired vintage clothing. Repairing and reselling clothing has less negative impact than creating new clothing does. The fourth megatrend is ""innovative recycling"" which is looking at waste as value. The industry is starting to create incentives for consumers to participate in the recycling of clothing."
Tailored couture is one option for the future of a greener fashion industry as it can potentially lead to less waste and more jobs improving the economy. Tailored couture is no longer desired because of the convenience of malls and stores provide but the consequence of the convenience is the pollution of the environment. Tailored clothing if it were to become the norm mass production of clothing that will not be bought can be reduced and reusing and redesigning old clothes to fit could reduce the amount of old worn out unfitting clothes thrown out or given away.
"In 2019, the UK Parliament's Environment Audit Committee published a report and recommendations on the future of fashion sustainability, suggesting wide-ranging systemic change, not least government regulation and tax-incentives for sustainable practices, such as lowered VAT for repair services. As highlighted in the report, wide political and social changes are needed to push industry towards more sustainable practices and levels of consumption: brands doing ""less harm"" is not enough. The report finishes with the following statement;""Retailers must take responsibility for the social and environmental cost of clothes. They should use their market power to demand higher environmental and labour standards from suppliers. Offering rental schemes, lifetime repair and providing the consumer with more information about the sourcing and true cost of clothing are all measures that can be more widely adopted. Shifting business practice in this way can not only improve a business’s environmental and social impact but also offer market advantage as they respond to the growing consumer demand for responsible, sustainable clothing.""(p.54)"

"Palinuro is an Italian small town, the most populated civil parish (""frazione"") of Centola, Province of Salerno, in the Campania region. The name of the town is derived from Palinurus, the helmsman of Aeneas, as recorded in the fifth and sixth books of the ""Aeneid""."
"Palinuro lies on the southern side of Cilento, on the Tyrrhenian Sea and in the northern part of Cape Palinuro. The town, situated at the estuaries of the Lambro and Mingardo rivers, is also the main port of the comune. It is 7 km from Centola, 8 km from Marina di Camerota, 10 km from Pisciotta and 80 km from Salerno."
"Palinuro is part of the Cilento and Vallo di Diano National Park, an area of ""shrubland"" typical of Mediterranean countries."
"It is popular with tourists, especially in summer, due to the cleanliness of its waters and beautiful beaches; and is regularly awarded five stars Blue Flag <br>"
"The town is also famous for the caves along its coast, which are regularly visited, especially by frogmen."
"The town is linked to Salerno and Naples by hydrofoils. The nearest main road is 10 km to the north, connecting Salerno-Battipaglia-Paestum-Agropoli-Vallo della Lucania-Policastro-Sapri."
"The nearest railway station, Pisciotta-Palinuro (on the Naples-Reggio Calabria line) is 8 km to the north and is linked to the town by regular buses."
"The Arco Naturale beach of Palinuro was selected as a location in various films including Jason and the Argonauts, Hercules and the Captive Women, and Clash of the Titans."
= = = Down in the Boondocks (song) = = =
"""Down in the Boondocks"" is a song written by Joe South, with sampling from Gene Pitney's ""Twenty Four Hours from Tulsa"", and recorded by American artist Billy Joe Royal. It was a hit in 1965, reaching number 9 on the ""Billboard"" Hot 100 chart. In the UK, it hit number 38 on the ""Record Retailer"" chart. In Canada, the song reached #1 on the RPM Magazine charts, August 9, 1965. The song comes from the album ""Down in the Boondocks""."
"The song is sung from the perspective of a self-proclaimed ""boy from down in the boondocks."" He sings of a girl who lives nearby, for whom he feels love and he steals away with occasionally. The people who live or are born in the boondocks are suggested to be a lower class than those in the city. The girl's father is the singer's boss man, which, along with the social division, prevents him from proclaiming his love and connecting with them, despite the shared feelings (which is the basis for the line ""but I don't dare knock on her door/for her daddy is my boss man""). The singer proclaims that ""one fine day, I'll find a way, to move from this old shack,"" presumably to be able to join the higher class members of society and finally be able to date the girl within the public eye."
"Session musicians on this recording included Reggie Young on electric guitar, Bill Hullett on acoustic guitar, Sam Levine on horns, Clayton Ivey on piano, Bob Wray on six string bass, and Greg Morrow on drums."
"Penny DeHaven's 1969 version reached No. 37 on the ""Billboard"" country chart. The song was covered in 1978 by Kenny Loggins on his ""Nightwatch"" album, and twice in 1980, first by Ry Cooder, included it on his album, ""Borderline"" and by D.L. Byron, featuring backing vocals by Billy Joel. It was also recorded by Depeche Mode member Martin Gore for his first solo CD ""Counterfeit E.P."" in 1989 but was ultimately left out of the final track listing. In 2012 the band U.S. Girls covered the song on their album ""Gem"". The country vocal group Home Free covered the song for their album ""Country Evolution"". Holy Sons (Emil Amos) covered the song on the album Decline of the West Volumes 1 and 2."
"A common Renaissance and Baroque theme is females that are abducted or seduced by divinities. This includes Leda and the swan as Zeus, as well as Europa, Antiope, and Danae. Many portrayals of women being seduced by divinities are shown in a sensual manner. For instance, Rubens's ""Leda"", is very erotic. Leda is shown fully nude with her buttocks and left breast being visible. The swan is caressing her on her most intimate area with its neck cradled between her breasts. The swan is depicted as a graceful animal who also can ravish."
"There are many variations to the myth of Leda and the swan. Leda is sometimes called Nemesis and other times they are two separate people. Leda was married to the king of Sparta, Tyndareus. She is the mother of several children though she is most known for giving birth to Clytemnestra, Helen, Pollux, and Castor. The most common myth claims that Zeus transformed himself into a swan to couple with Leda. Some versions claim that she loved Zeus and willing had sexual relations with him, while other versions claim she was seduced and therefore was not willing. That same night, she coupled with Tyndareus also. Leda then gave birth to four children at the same time. The two pairs of twins resulted in Helen and Pollux belonging to Zeus, and Clytemnestra and Castor belonging to Tyndareus. Though each pair is attributed to either Zeus or Tyndareus, each man is said to be the father of all four children. Castor and Pollux were called the Dioscuri meaning “Zeus’s sons,” even though Castor was mortal because he was the son of Tyndareus and Pollux was immortal because he was the son of Zeus."
"According to Hermes in Lucians’ ""The Dialogues of the Dead"", Leda and her daughter (Helen of Troy) are the only women worthy of the title “beauties of old.” Rubens's depictions of Leda clearly embody the phrase. With Leda's curvy figure, alabaster skin, and golden hair, she is a sight to behold. Because Rubens was known for this type of female figures, Leda was the perfect subject to paint. Rubens became famous partly for his Rubenesque figures and were not common at the time, making his two ""Leda’s"" stand out even more."

= = = Control Center (iOS) = = =
"Control Center (or Control Centre in some countries) is a feature of Apple Inc.'s iOS operating system, introduced as part of iOS 7, released on September 18, 2013. It gives iOS devices direct access to important settings for the device by swiping a finger up from the bottom of the display (or a swipe down from the top right corner on iPhone X, XS and XR series and iPad devices). It is similar to the SBSettings tweak for iOS jailbreaking."
"Control Center gives iOS users quick access to commonly used controls and apps. By swiping up from any screen – including the Lock screen (if the control center is set to be accessed from the lock screen) – users can do such things as switch on Airplane mode, turn Wi-Fi on or off, adjust the display brightness and similar basic functions of the device."
"Since iOS 7, it also included an integrated flashlight function to operate the reverse camera's flash LED as a flashlight. The flashlight feature is only available on iPhone and iPod Touch, and iPad Pro. Beginning with iOS 9.3, a Night Shift toggle became available through the Control Center on all iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad models that have an Apple A7 chip or later."
"Other functions are offered, such as the ability to turn Bluetooth, and Do Not Disturb on or off; lock the screen's orientation; play, pause, or skip a song, see what is playing; connect to AirPlay-enabled devices; and quickly access the clock, calculator, and camera apps. Users also have access to AirDrop, previously only available on Macs and newly added to iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch models using the Lightning connector in iOS 7, as a method of transferring files between Apple devices."
"In iOS 7 through iOS 9, it featured a single-paged slide up panel with a blurred background, which provided a layer of translucency over the content below. The design for the most part remained the same, aside from a few small, occasional changes. Due to the intense resources needed to create a blurred effect, iPhone 4, iPad 2 and iPad 3 do not feature a translucent background, and instead feature a grey background with slight transparency without blur."
"In iOS 10, it morphed into a card-like design with a white background, and separated into three separate cards accessible by swiping horizontally. The first card consisted of main device controls, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Do Not Disturb, while the second page was dedicated to media controls, and the third page for controlling HomeKit enabled devices linked in the Home application."
"The Control Center received a significant redesign in iOS 11, unifying its different pages into one and allowing users to 3D Touch (or long press on devices without 3D Touch) the icons for additional options, and vertical sliders allow users to adjust volume and brightness. The Control Center is customizable via the Settings app, and allows for a wider range of settings features to be shown, including cellular service, Low Power Mode, and a shortcut to the Notes app. These changes are still present in the current stable release of iOS 12."
"iOS 12 brought few new additions to Control Center, but of them, the most notable being updates to Do Not Disturb. Now, when users 3D Touch, or long press the Do Not Disturb icon, it allows them to automatically set when a Do Not Disturb session will end. Current options include setting it to turn off after one hour, when leaving your current location, the next morning, or when a calendar event ends."
"Control Center has received generally positive reviews. In contrast for the user having to access the Settings application to change most preferences, Darrell Etherington of TechCrunch thought that ""separating [Control Center] from that function and making it accessible throughout the iOS user interface via a simple swipe up from bottom is a really big improvement."""
"The iOS 11 update was criticized for changing the way the buttons for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth work; more specifically, the toggles would disconnect devices from Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, while leaving the radios on. The Electronic Frontier Foundation stated that this change not only hurt battery life, but was also bad for security, describing the buttons as turning Wi-Fi and Bluetooth ""off-ish"" (greyed out, but not crossed out, as it would appear if switched off directly from the Settings app), as well as further criticizing the connections resuming at 5:00 am everyday."

"Trenary placed 5th in her first senior national championships in 1986. Later that summer she won the U.S. Olympic Festival. In fall 1986 she placed second to Elizabeth Manley at the St. Ivel International. At the U.S. championships in 1987, she finished second in both the compulsory figures and short program, where she landed a triple flip jump for the first time in her combination. In the long program Trenary landed four clean triple jumps, including the triple flip, and she upset reigning world champion Debi Thomas to take her first senior national title. At the 1987 World Championships, she rallied from 11th in the compulsory figures to place fourth in the short program, again landing the triple flip jump in combination, and fifth in the long program, to place 7th overall. In 1988, Thomas regained the U.S. title, with Trenary finishing second. Trenary placed 4th at the 1988 Winter Olympics. She was 5th at the 1988 World Championships, where she fell on the triple flip in both her short and long programs. Due to her strength in compulsory figures, Trenary again won the U.S. Championships in 1989, although she was defeated by Kristi Yamaguchi in the free skating. Trenary won bronze at the 1989 World Championships."
"In 1990, Trenary won both the U.S. and World titles. Her strength in the compulsory figures was the deciding factor at the 1990 World Championships. She was 5th in the short program and second in the free skate to Midori Ito but her top placement in the figures kept her in the lead overall. The International Skating Union eliminated figures after that season. After she won her World title, her coach, Carlo Fassi, returned to live in his home country, Italy, and Trenary began working with Kathy Casey."
"Trenary's triple jumps included the toe loop, salchow, and flip, which was quite competitive for a female singles skater in the mid-to-late 1980s. One of her signature moves was a combination of a one-foot axel into a triple salchow."
"In January 1991, Trenary underwent surgery to drain her ankle after she developed a staph infection. As a result, she withdrew from the 1991 U.S. Championships. In March 1991, Trenary moved to Cleveland, Ohio, to work with Carol Heiss Jenkins."
"With the elimination of compulsory figures—formerly Trenary's strength—from competition, the technical standard for jumping in women's skating had risen greatly, with the top skaters all attempting five or six different triples. Trenary's injury was slow to heal and she had problems regaining her former standard of jumps, much less learning new ones. She planned to compete at the 1992 U.S. Championships, beginning her comeback in fall 1991 at Skate Canada, where she finished second in the short program to Surya Bonaly, but dropped to fourth overall after the long program, where she was unable to successfully land any triple jumps. She qualified for the 1992 U.S. Nationals by winning the 1991 Midwestern Sectional Championships with an uneven performance: after a strong short program in which she landed a triple flip combination, she was unable to land any triple jumps in the long program. She ended her bid to qualify for the 1992 Winter Olympics in December 1991."
"After turning professional, Trenary toured with the Tom Collins Tour of Champions and Stars on Ice for several years. Prior to the 1993 World Championships, the eventual winner and soon-to-be Olympic champion, Oksana Baiul, cited Trenary as her favorite skater for her beauty and style. Although Trenary's early professional competitive career was uneven, in 1996 she skated particularly strong programs, choreographed by her then-husband, Christopher Dean, to George Winston's ""Variations on a Theme by Pachelbel"", and to Nancy Sinatra's ""These Boots Are Made for Walkin' as part of the U.S. team in its victory over the world team in Ice Wars."
Trenary retired from skating in 1997 after developing a life-threatening blood clot in her shoulder.
"Trenary married British ice dancer Christopher Dean on October 15, 1994. They have two sons, Jack Robert and Sam Colin. Dean's agent confirmed in March 2010 the couple had separated."

"The Wisconsin tornado outbreak of 2005 was an outbreak of tornadoes that occurred primarily in southern Wisconsin on August 18, 2005. A system of storms unleashed a total of 28 tornadoes, 27 of which were confirmed in southern Wisconsin, and 1 confirmed in Minnesota. This outbreak set a new record for the most tornadoes observed in the state in a single day, breaking the previous record of 24 tornadoes set on May 8, 1988. The system generating the Stoughton tornado was also accompanied by many reports of severe winds and hail throughout the region. The Stoughton tornado was documented on an episode of The Weather Channel's ""Storm Stories""."
"By far the most significant tornado of the day developed 2.0 miles (3.2 km) north of Oregon at 6:15 p.m.. This large, intense multiple-vortex tornado tracked 20.0 miles (32.2 km) into Jefferson County from Dane County, devastating the town of Stoughton."
"East of Oregon the tornado tore through several farms before impacting residential subdivisions in Stoughton. One person was crushed to death in their basement from fireplace and chimney bricks that crashed through the floor. Numerous homes, businesses, farm buildings, vehicles, power-lines, trees, and other personal effects were either damaged or destroyed along its path that grew to a maximum width of about 600 yards north of Stoughton. As for residential structures, 220 sustained minor damage, 84 had major damage, and 69 were destroyed. As for business structures, 6 sustained minor damage, 1 had major damage, and 1 was destroyed. As for agricultural structures, 5 sustained minor damage, 5 had major damage, and 40 were destroyed. Several vehicles were flipped and tossed as well. Some homes in town were completely leveled, and an F4 rating was considered. Further investigation revealed that the homes were not well-built, and the slow (sometimes nearly stationary) forward movement of the tornado negated a rating higher than F3. After striking Stoughton, the tornado caused damage to trees and crops north of Busseyville before dissipating. Debris from this tornado was lofted by the parent updraft and carried downstream to scattered locations in the counties of Jefferson, Waukesha, Milwaukee, Walworth, Racine, and Kenosha. 23 people were injured."

"The original bridge across the Minho River was built during the first century rule of Emperor Augustus though other sources state that it was built during the Trajan period. A mention is made of this bridge in the will of Doña Urraca, where it is said that it was repaired with funds provided by Ferdinand III. From the Middle Ages, it has provided access to the city of Ourense for trade and pilgrimage.

"The English College Johore Bahru, also known as Maktab Sultan Abu Bakar, abbreviated as English College, EC, MSAB, The College, and sometimes dubbed ""The Pride Of Johore"", is an old premier school in Malaysia. It is an all-boys school in Johor Bahru, Johor. The school is under the royal patronage of the Sultanate of Johor, and it has been awarded the status of Cluster School of Excellence by the Ministry of Education (Malaysia). English College Johore Bahru (EC) is one of the ten oldest English institutions in Malaysia and the oldest school in Johore."
"English College was established on 21 March 1914, with 21 students selected from Bukit Zaharah School. The school was initially located close to the Sungai Chat Palace facing the Lido Beach in Johor Bahru. Remains of the former school site can still be seen but on the site is now the M Suite Hotel, while the campus of vocational studies has been replaced by the old Royal Malaysian Customs of Johore. The 21 students were placed under the tutelage of two teachers brought over from England, Morrison and Holman. These 21 students can be regarded as the pioneers, and from this beginning EC became an educational institution in Johor Bahru."
"The education system of the EC was based on that of the English public school and it adopted the British syllabus, and EC later became a model for other English medium schools in Johor. The teachers of the school were initially recruited from Europe, although later locally trained teachers were used to teach Malay subjects."
"After end of World War I in 1918, the EC held for the first time its "" Junior Cambridge"" examinations, later followed by"" Senior Cambridge"" examinations. However, the results for both examinations were poor, and as a consequence the school was closed temporarily in 1928 for reassessment. It reopened in May of the same year, and after remedial actions had been taken by the school administration, the school met its target at the end of 1928. 143 students were selected to study Mathematics, Science and English. Also in 1928, T. Drury, who had been in the Education Service of Malaya since 1921, was appointed the principal of EC."
"At the end of 1930, the school moved to its present location at Jalan Sungei Chat. Of the original school, only stone blocks and steps are left, which can still be seen at its old site. The new EC was officially opened in early 1931, and the school has since produced many outstanding students. Two of its most famous students are Tun Hussein Onn, who later became the Prime Minister and Tun Musa Hitam, the Deputy Prime Minister."
"Some of the notable teachers there were Pendeta Za'Ba, T. Drury, T. Grundy, Mr Bion Dury, Hj. Zulkipli Bin Hj. Mahmod, Victor Joshua Jeyaretnam (father of J. B. Jeyaretnam) and Mohamad Bin Iskandar (father of Tun Mahathir Mohamad)."
"During the Japanese occupation of Malaya from 1941 to 1945, the EC was used as a military base, a factory, a military hospital, as well as a prison camp by the Japanese. The school reopened in early 1946 after the end of Japanese occupation. H. L. Hill was appointed the Headmaster of EC, and under his leadership, the EC returned to its status of a prestigious school. In 1949, the first group of girls was admitted to the EC."
"In 1960, following the end of the British rule in Malaya, the name was changed to"" 'Maktab Sultan Abu Bakar""' (MSAB) after Sultan Sir Abu Bakar of Johor who was the Father of Modern Johore. More local teachers were employed to teach at the school. In 1961, the school badge and uniforms were introduced for the first time. This was followed by creation of the school song with lyrics written by Yusof bin Karto set to music by Lim Teck Siang."
"In 1974, EC celebrated its Diamond Jubilee, and the then Deputy Prime Minister Tun Hussein Onn as well as all the former students were invited to the celebration. Also in 1974, the first batch of students of Sekolah Menengah Sains Johor was placed temporarily in the English College until the completion of the school's building in the month of April 1974."
"During the 1980s and 1990s, the school was further enlarged and facilities were added for student's use in accordance with the requirements of Ministry of Education and the introduction of Integrated Secondary School Curriculum (ICSS)."
"In 2005 EC recorded the best PMR performance for Johor Bahru when three EC students were selected as national top PMR candidates, namely Joshua Soo Iyn Zhou, Mukeshakumar and Wong Guo Wai and Yong Jenn. EC was confirmed by the Ministry of Education as a Premier school. In 2007, the company won the award for Excellent Crew EC Best Company and Best Service in Young Entrepreneurs Convention 11th. PMR 2007 once again recorded excellent results when an EC students selected as outstanding PMR Johor."
"On 5 May 2009, the English College was officially selected by the Ministry of Education as a Cluster School of Excellence. EC was selected based on its excellence in various aspects such as the achievement of excellence in the Paralympic Games, excellence in mathematics in the PMR and SPM, excellence in Orchestra and Rugby team as well as the various programs organised by EC, for example the creation of the Tun Hussein Onn Museum and Visual Arts Gallery EC."
"The college celebrated its centenary on 21 March, an event attended by dignitaries, old boys, and townspeople. Among the attendees were the Sultan of Johor, Sultan Ibrahim Al-Marhum Sultan Iskandar, along with Minister of Johor, Tan Sri Khaled Nordin as well as notable alumni and other old boys and former students of the English College. On this day, a handwritten letter Royal Professor Ungku Aziz Ungku Abd Hamid was read by his daughter Zeti Akhtar Aziz. Centenary Celebration Dinner took place at the school field and was attended by all the old boys and old staff, with performances from Datuk Sheikh Abdullah Ahmad, Ajai, Ayai Illusi and Rahmat Mega, who are also old boys of the college."
"The first building was at Bukit Zaharah Palace in 1914. The Western architectural features can be seen in the use of classical Ionic columns, decorative plasters for the outer walls and interiors of the building and decorative glass above the windows and doors of keystone shape. Similar to other Western architectural features, the windows of this building are of segmental shape. The second school building was initially located close to the Sungai Chat Palace facing the Lido Beach in Johor Bahru. Remains of the former school site can still be seen but on the site is now the M Suite Hotel. The most recognisable feature of the school is The New School (built in 1930), a building with pseudo English Classic Victorian architecture once be a Malay Teacher Training College at Johore Bahru and later on change into the famous English College Johore Bahru in 1931. The school is built to accommodate 300 students initially. Thus, the planning for the construction of the East Wing was considered. The block was completed by 1931 when it took in its first nucleus student. The school compound was enlarged, and a sports complex and a library was constructed. On 2001, an engineering block and a mini auditorium were completed. Furthermore, Seri Budiman Hall was completed and set to be a most advance hall in Malaysia on the year of 1950. On 2008, the Tunku Mahkota of Johor, Tunku Ibrahim Ismail, son of HRH Sultan Iskandar consented to the launching ceremony for the construction of the hall that was named as Sultan Iskandar Hall."
"On every Wednesday, co-curricular activities are usually held. There are two types of co-curricular activities, and these are club & societies and uniformed bodies. Every student has to wear their uniformed body uniforms whatever the activities may be on the day."
"The uniformed bodies that are present in the school are English College Marching Band, Persatuan Kadet Bersatu Malaysia Darat (Army), Malaysian Red Crescent Society (BSMM), 1st Johore BahruScout, 5th Johore Bahru SeaScout, Malaysian Fire Brigade Cadet, Kadet Remaja Sekolah Malaysia, Persatuan Kadet Bersatu Malaysia Laut (Navy), Persatuan Seni Silat Olahraga, Malaysian Police Bridgade Cadet, and St.John Ambulance Bridgade Cadet (Div 1)"
"The school has three sport fields. One is in front of the Johor Darul Takzim F.C exercise field, reserved for rugby. The second field is in front of the New School reserved for soccer. The third open space is in front of the Sultan Iskandar Hall reserved for cricket, baseball, hockey practice and it is used for various purposes and competitions. In 2012, The Pavilion suitable for various purposes was completed along with the seatings at the school field. On 2013, The College set to be a first school that has a paintball field in Malaysia."
"The school excels in sports and Olympiad events. It became a powerhouse in rugby during the 1950s and still has one of the best rugby school teams in the Johore. Nicknamed ""Stingboks"" after the South Africa national rugby union team for its all yellow and green strip, they perform the haka before matches. It has held a match series against Singapore elite schools since 1960. In odd-numbered years, the match is held in Seri Gelam Field( Home of English College Rugby Team). In addition to this, EC competes with rival Royal Military College, Malay College Kuala Kangsar, Sultan Abdul Hamid College, Sultan Ismail College and Tanjung Puteri Vocational College every year in a multi-games carnival."
"Other than rugby, EC has excelled in sports such as Soccer, Hockey, Athletics, Chess, Cricket, Basketball,and Bowling. English College Football Club (ECFC) was a powerhouse in Johore during the 1950s and 1960s, meanwhile English College Bowling Team has produced two of the best national players in Malaysia, one of whom was entered in Sukma Games. English College has produced some of the best and most talented national players of any sport in the country."
"The Annual College Sports Day always held at ruggers field. In 1990, The Annual English College Sports Day start held at Larkin Stadium. On 2013, English College decided that The Annual Sports Day held at school field for the first time since 1981."
"The shield is a symbol of determination, the colour green symbolises ""purity"", and yellow symbolises ""loyalty to king and country"". (Yellow is considered a royal colour in Malaysia, and it usually represents the sovereignty of the reigning monarchs)"
"On the left and right sides of the shield are laurel wreaths symbolising the close co-operation and understanding among the citizens of EC to keep its glorious hope. The school motto is ""Labore Et Honore"", which is Latin for ""Labour And Honour""."
"The waving of the hand is a nonverbal gesture that has an unclear origin but is said to have dated back to as far as the 18th century however, it was not called waving and was not used as saying ""hello"", or ""goodbye."" The original gesture of waving was saluting. In the 18th century, knights removed the guard of their helmets to show their identity, following with a salute to show they come in peace; saluting is also used to show others that they are not armed with weapons and do not pose a threat. The action of saluting was formalised only in the 1780s by European armies, and since then, it has become a common way of properly addressing one another in the military setting. There is also an alternate ASL origin. In the 1800s, waving handkerchiefs was a way to show approval or excitement or to call attention for the deaf, and the Romans, which is known as the ""Chautauqua salute."" It is recorded during a Canadian event in 1884 that multiple attendees forgot their handkerchief and so waved their hands in the air as a way to clap during the event.. In modern days, the accepted and common way for a deaf individual to applaud is raising hands in the air and simultaneously shaking their open hand and moving their fingers back and forth."
"Waving ""hello"" or ""goodbye"" to the deaf requires a different protocol and has an alternate meaning than the standard, one action waving gesture that means both ""hello"" or ""goodbye."" For an ASL user or a deaf individual, saying ""goodbye"" is done by repeatedly opening and closing the right hand, and it faces the receiver of the gesture. This method is used to say ""goodbye"" to a group of people; saying ""goodbye"" to an individual is done with a different method. Saying ""hello"" is done by the traditional waving of the right hand. This method is used to say ""hello"" to a group of people, likewise with implying ""goodbye"", there is a different method to say ""hello"" to an individual."
"The waving of the hand has multiple variables and styles of performing the gesture. The common waving of the hand to mean ""hello"" or ""goodbye"" is done by moving the hand side to side, but there are more than one form of waving, each form having its own meaning."
"Waving has four variables: the open palm (is the palm curved or straight), the angle of the wave (big waves or short waves), the elevation of the hand (above the head or held low), and the movement pattern of the wave (sideways rotation, up and down motion, side to side motion)."
"There are different ways to wave the hand; some include the standard side-to-side wave, palm wide wave, wiggly wave (finger wiggle wave), ""flirtatious"" wave, open-and close finger wave, arm wave, and the ""Miss America"" wave."
"People wave by raising their hand and moving it from side to side. Another common wave is to raise one's hand and repeatedly move the fingers downward toward the palm. A variant known as the wiggly wave consists of holding the hand near shoulder level and wiggling the fingers randomly. This can be used to appear cute or flirtatious to the target of the wave. The gesture can be used to attract attention at a distance. Most commonly, though, the gesture means quite simply ""hello"" or ""goodbye"
"The royal wave, also known as a regal wave, pageant wave, parade wave, or Miss America wave, is a similar but distinct kind of hand waving gesture in which a person executes something alternatively described as either a 'plastic grin' with 'fingers cupped' and 'forearm swaying side-to-side' or a ""vertical hand with a slight twist from the wrist"". The gesture is often performed, to various degrees, by different members of the British royal family, signaling anything from regality, class and control to elegance, restraint and character."
"In American culture, waving is a known gesture that means ""hello"" or ""goodbye"". That gesture can also be used to call the attention of someone, for example waving down a taxi, or waving at a friend from a great distance. That gesture can may be interpreted differently and have a different meaning or even be highly offensive in South Korea, Europe, Nigeria, Greece, Bulgaria, Latin American countries, India, Japan, and other places.<ref name=""book/web ref""></ref>"
"In Nigeria, waving the hand with the palm facing outward in front of someone's face is highly offensive and should be avoided."
"In China, women greet other women by waving."
"In Japan, hand waving while the palm is kept outward and near the face is a gesture used to display confusion or that the individual waving does not know or understand."
"In South Korea, it is inappropriate to call the attention of someone with a palm-up arm wave. Instead, the proper way to wave to someone or call for attention is to wave vertically, making sure the palm of the hand is in a downward position. It is not uncommon to see waving among the younger population (in South Korea) to display their departure rather than bowing, which is the traditional way of greeting one another. Waving the hand outward towards the face is also used to grab the attention of a pet or child."
"In Europe, there are two different common forms of waving: the palm-show and the palm-hide. The palm-show is dominant across most of Europe, but Italy predominantly uses the palm-hide wave."
"Waving the hand to say ""hello"" or ""goodbye"" is done by moving the fingers down towards the wrist and back to an open palm position while keeping the palm facing out. Another way to say ""goodbye"" is done by wagging the fingers. That motion (wagging fingers) is also used to say ""no."""
"In Greece, waving the hand with the palm facing out is an insult, rather than a greeting."
"Holding the hand out, palm facing out and all five fingers exposed is offensive and dates back to the Byzantine times, when ""moutza"" would involve prisoners' faces being tainted with charcoal by their own hands and being forced to parade down town streets, ""moutza"". In American culture, holding the hand out like that can be used to call someone's attention or to greet someone."
"In Ireland, the deaf use the hand wave to greet one another. Deaf women use an ""open palms up half moon shape"" type of wave to greet one another. Men, however, use a different way of greeting one another or women."
"In Latin American countries, people greet one another by kissing, hugging or shaking hands. Waving their hand is uncommon, but it neither has any negative representation nor causes offense."
"In Nicaragua, waving to someone is tolerated but does not display proper etiquette. Instead, it is common to hug, kiss, or shake hands, following with the proper time of day (""good morning,"" ""good afternoon,"" or ""good evening"")."

= = = Maryland Route 170 = = =
"Maryland Route 170 (MD 170) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland. The state highway runs from MD 175 in Odenton north to MD 2 in Brooklyn Park. MD 170 connects the western Anne Arundel County communities of Odenton and Severn and the North County communities of Linthicum, Pumphrey, and Brooklyn Park with Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI Airport). The highway connects BWI Airport with Interstate 695 (I-695) and MD 100 and forms part of the Airport Loop, a circumferential highway that connects the airport and I-195 with many airport-related services."
"MD 170 originally served as the main highway between Baltimore and Fort George G. Meade. This highway, which included part of modern MD 174 west of Severn, was mostly constructed shortly after Camp Meade was established during World War I in the late 1910s. The Odenton–Severn portion of MD 170 was originally built as MD 554 in the 1930s, but became part of MD 170 in the mid-1940s. MD 170 went through another round of upgrades in the early 1940s due to its strategic importance during World War II. The highway originally passed through the area now occupied by BWI Airport. MD 170 was relocated north of MD 176 in the late 1940s during the construction of the airport and south of MD 176 in the late 1950s. The highway has been expanded to four lanes around its interchanges with I-195, I-695, MD 32, and MD 100 and along the perimeter of BWI Airport since the 1960s."
"MD 170 begins at an intersection with MD 175 (Annapolis Road) in Odenton. The highway continues south as county-maintained Piney Orchard Parkway, which leads to the Odenton station on MARC's Penn Line and the Piney Orchard community. MD 170 heads north on Telegraph Road, which begins as a four-lane divided highway but reduces to a two-lane undivided road and passes through an industrial area. The state highway expands to a four-lane divided highway again shortly before its diamond interchange with MD 32 (Patuxent Freeway). MD 170 continues north as a two-lane road with a center left-turn lane that crosses Severn Run. The center turn lane ends as the highway approaches the center of Severn. There, the highway intersects MD 174, which heads west as Reece Road and east as Donaldson Avenue. MD 170 expands to a four-lane divided highway as it approaches its single-point urban interchange with MD 100 (Paul T. Pitcher Memorial Highway). The highway becomes an undivided four-lane road between MD 100 and its intersection with MD 176 (Dorsey Road) at Harmans. The long ramp from westbound MD 176 to northbound MD 100 is unsigned MD 170A."
"MD 170 continues north as Aviation Boulevard and joins the Airport Loop. The highway parallels the Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, which carries MARC's Penn Line, and the hiker-biker BWI Trail. MD 170 meets the eastern end of Stoney Run Road, which heads east and immediately loops back west and crosses over the state highway and the railroad on its way to the BWI Car Rental Facility. The highway intersects unsigned MD 995 (Amtrak Way), which leads to the BWI Rail Station serving Amtrak and MARC trains, as it gradually curves to the east. MD 170 crosses Kitten Branch immediately before its partial cloverleaf interchange with the eastern terminus of I-195 and the northern terminus of MD 995A (Metropolitan Boulevard). The highway passes under the BWI Trail and expands to a divided highway before its intersection with Terminal Road and an at-grade intersection with MTA Maryland's Baltimore Light RailLink. Access to the rail line's BWI Business District station is via Elkridge Landing Road at the next intersection. MD 170 leaves the Airport Loop at its intersection with MD 162 (Aviation Boulevard), where the highway turns north onto Camp Meade Road."
"MD 170 intersects the Baltimore Light Rail again and begins to parallel it as a two-lane road with a center turn lane. The light rail veers away to the east shortly before the highway's intersection with MD 762 (Andover Road), where the center turn lane ends. MD 170 enters Linthicum and intersects the light rail line a third time and begins to parallel it again shortly before the Linthicum station in the center of the community. The highway intersects MD 169 (Maple Road) and expands to a four-lane divided highway shortly before its partial cloverleaf interchange with I-695 (Baltimore Beltway). There is no access from MD 170 to eastbound I-695 or from westbound I-695 to MD 170. The highway reduces to a two-lane road again and passes the North Linthicum station just south of MD 648 (Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard) in the center of Pumphrey. MD 170 continues northeast as Belle Grove Road, which veers away from the light rail line. The highway parallels the Patapsco River and passes under I-895 Spur (Harbor Tunnel Thruway) before entering Brooklyn Park. There, MD 170 reaches its northern terminus at a five-way intersection with MD 2, Jack Street, and Hanover Street at the Baltimore city limits. MD 2 heads south as Governor Ritchie Highway toward Glen Burnie and north into the city as Potee Street."
"MD 170 is a part of the National Highway System from its southern terminus in Odenton to I-695 in Linthicum. Within that stretch, there are two sections that serve as intermodal passenger transport links: from its southern terminus to MD 32 in Odenton, and from MD 176 to MD 162 along the perimeter of BWI Airport. The portions from MD 32 in Odenton to MD 176 in Severn and from MD 162 to I-695 within Linthicum are National Highway System principal arterials."
"When the Maryland State Roads Commission applied numbers to state highways, they assigned MD 170 to its current corridor from Severn to Brooklyn Park and to what is now MD 174 from Severn to Fort Meade. The portion of the modern highway from Odenton to Severn was originally MD 554. Much of what was to become MD 170 was constructed along the Old Annapolis Road between Pumphrey and Severn. A portion of this road ran through the hamlet of Wellham Crossroads in the middle of what is now BWI Airport. The highway was paved in macadam from the Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard in Pumphrey to Hammonds Ferry Road in Linthicum by 1910. A second section of improved highway was planned by 1910 from Linthicum south to Wellham Crossroads. A section of highway from the current MD 170–MD 174 intersection in Severn west to the Pennsylvania Railroad (now Amtrak's Northeast Corridor) was built as a concrete road by 1915."
"Construction on the highway from Severn to Linthicum became a high priority with the United States' entrance into World War I; the remainder of the Severn–Linthicum highway and the highway from the railroad at Severn southwest to newly established Camp Meade, now collectively called the Camp Meade Road, were paved in concrete between 1916 and 1919. Belle Grove Road from Pumphrey to Brooklyn Park was also paved in concrete in this period of time. A poorly constructed portion of the Camp Meade Road between Wellham Crossroads and Dorsey Road was repaved with asphalt in 1919. MD 170 was relocated at the railroad crossing when the highway's overpass of the Pennsylvania Railroad was completed in 1931. The old road, which is now Severn Station Road west of the tracks and Old Camp Meade Road to the east, became MD 483."
"Telegraph Road from Severn to Odenton was built as a concrete road in three sections. The highway was constructed from the right-angle turn in the Camp Meade Road in Severn south to Evergreen Road in 1932 and 1933. Another section of MD 554 was completed from Odenton Road (then MD 180 and later MD 677) in Odenton to a point north of Old Mill Road in 1936. The gap in MD 554 was filled in or shortly after 1940. MD 170 was widened to from Brooklyn Park to Pumphrey in 1940. With the outbreak of World War II, MD 170 was designated a road of strategic importance to connect Baltimore with Fort Meade; the highway was reconstructed as a asphalt-surfaced concrete road in 1942. By 1946, MD 170 and MD 554 had swapped numbers, with the former now the road from Severn to Odenton."
"MD 170 was relocated as a road from MD 176 north to what is now the MD 170–MD 162 junction in 1947 and 1948 to make way for the construction of Friendship International Airport. The highway's interchange with the Friendship International Airport Access Road, which was designated MD 46 and later became I-195, was started in 1950, the same year the airport opened, and completed in 1954. South of the airport, MD 170 ran concurrently with MD 176 from the current MD 176–MD 652 intersection west to current MD 170A, which the highway used to connect with the modern alignment of MD 170. The stub of MD 170 north from MD 176 to Friendship Cemetery on the airport reservation became MD 652. MD 170 assumed its present alignment west of MD 170A when the highway was relocated from MD 176 south to the site of the MD 100 interchange as the first carriageway of an ultimate divided highway between 1958 and 1960. The old alignment became much of current MD 652 and the portion of MD 652 north of MD 176 was transferred to county maintenance."
"When the expressway spur between MD 168 and U.S. Route 301 (now MD 648) was built between 1951 and 1954, the expressway, which became part of the Baltimore Beltway, included an at-grade intersection with MD 170 between Linthicum and Pumphrey. This junction was replaced with the present interchange in 1967; MD 170 was expanded to a divided highway on either side of the interchange in 1968. MD 170's grade separation with Stoney Run Road on the west side of the airport was built in 1982. The state highway was expanded to a four-lane divided highway from north of I-195 to MD 162 when the adjacent east–west portion of MD 162 was built in 1988. MD 170 was expanded to a four-lane divided highway through its interchange with MD 100 when the single-point urban interchange was built in 1995. MD 170 had been expanded to four lanes through its interchange with MD 32 and from MD 176 through the I-195 interchange, and had its southern terminus rolled back from MD 677 to MD 175, by 1999."
"MD 170A is the designation for the one-way ramp from westbound MD 176 to northbound MD 170 southwest of BWI Airport. The ramp is included in the clockwise direction of the Airport Loop and has a spur near its southern end. MD 170A, which has the official designation of MD 170 Spur, was assigned by 1999."

"Stuart A. Weitzman (born 1941) is an American shoe designer, entrepreneur and founder of the shoe company, Stuart Weitzman. Weitzman has designed footwear for Beyoncé and Taylor Swift. In 2014 Weitzman paid a world record $9.48 million for the British Guiana 1c magenta stamp. In May 2017, Stuart Weitzman Holdings, LLC, appointed Giovanni Morelli as Creative Director and Weitzman stepped down from his role."
"In the late 1950s, Weitzman's father, Seymour Weitzman and his older brother Warren opened a shoe factory in Haverhill, Massachusetts, called ""Seymour Shoes"". Weitzman began designing shoes for his father's business in the early 1960s."
"Weitzman graduated from George W. Hewlett High School in 1958 and the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in 1963. When Seymour died in 1965, Warren and Stuart ran the business. They sold the business to a company in Spain in 1971, and Weitzman continued to design shoes for the company. In 1994, he bought back the business, but he continues to manufacture his shoe designs in Spain."
"Weitzman is known for providing one-of-a-kind, ""million dollar"" shoes to an Oscar nominee to wear at the Academy Awards, including a pair of platinum sandals adorned with 464 diamonds that actress Laura Harring wore to the 2002 ceremony. For the 2007 Oscars, shoes were designed for and provided to Diablo Cody, who subsequently declined to wear them, stating that she was not aware of nor interested in the publicity attendant with wearing the shoes. Weitzman uses unique materials including cork, vinyl, lucite, wallpaper, and 24-karat gold. His shoes are sold in over 70 countries."
"The eponymous company that Weitzman founded has changed hands a number of times. Jones Apparel Group purchased a majority stake in the company in 2010 and later bought the remaining 45 percent of shares retained by Weitzman in 2012. In January 2015, Sycamore Partners LLC (the private equity fund that owns Jones Apparel Group) agreed to sell the company to Coach, the luxury fashion house, for $574 million. As part of the deal, Weitzman stayed on as a shoe designer for the company."
Weitzman is married to Jane Gershon. Stuart and Jane have two daughters.
"On June 17, 2014, Weitzman, who had collected stamps as a child, anonymously purchased the ""world's most famous stamp"", the British Guiana 1c magenta at a Sotheby's auction in New York for $9,480,000, including buyer's premium, the highest price ever paid for a postage stamp. Weitzman has since identified himself as the purchaser and has lent the stamp to the National Postal Museum for exhibition. In June 2015, Weitzman also identified himself as the current owner of the unique plate block of four 1918 U.S. 24-cent Inverted Jennies, widely regarded as the world's most celebrated philatelic printing error."
Stuart has a philanthropic foundation in Spain and is a member of the Board of Trustees of the Hispanojudía Foundation.

"Zi Mo seems to be close to the Way, but he does not understand the following: the proper measure is defined as following the Way at the right time; the middle is defined as others with the proper measure; and the position between Yang Zi and Mo Zi is not the place to seek the middle."
6. Zhōnggǔ:
"If one just knows that one should not sever ties with others but does not know how to weigh others to give evenly, then there is no danger of becoming an egoist, but on the other hand those who follow the Way and strive to perfect themselves will also be seen as approaching egoism and consequently one will not dare act in like manner."
"If one understands that one should not sacrifice oneself for others but cannot give to others on an individual basis, then there is no danger of loving indiscriminately, but on the other hand those who follow the Way and strive to perfect the whole Empire will also be seen as approaching indiscriminate love and consequently one will not be willing to act in like manner."
7. Hòugǔ:
"One may say that I plan to escape from Yang Zi. However, Yang Zi saw himself and not others, while Zi Mo saw a fixed position not an open passage. In essence, all these are but parochial teachings. Really, can those who know how to adapt to myriad changes be like this?"
"One may say that I plan to escape from Mo Zi. However, Mo Zi saw others and not himself, while Zi Mo saw tracks and not transformations. In essence all these are but one-sided delusions. Really, can those who respond to eternal inconstancy be like this?"
8. Shùgû:
"The point is, egoism is one extreme, and indiscriminate love is another extreme. That is why it is easy to understand that Yang Zi and Mo Zi each held on to an extreme."

"There are two types of printing and publishing related to the eight-legged essay, one for the exams themselves and the other for public purposes. After the test-takers finished with their exams, their papers were collected in the testing room and sent over to be graded. They were then printed with the graders' comments and in the order of the score rank. During the late Ming Dynasty, commercial publishing also increased in the face of increasing commercialization of culture. The public printing, publishing, and dissemination of the essays prompted more people to be interested candidates of the civil service examination during the Ming and Qing dynasties."
"One virtue of the eight-legged essays is that its composition is well defined and easy to follow. For the purpose of administering a large group of exam-takers, this structure allowed convenient regulation as the exam-takers were not likely to deviate from the requirements. Thus, this format contributed to ensuring standard and fairness in the civil service examination system. The examiners could reduce the amount of time spent in grading exams by being accustomed to this format, and uncertainties in the grading schemes were reduced. A scholar named Tian Qilin defended the eight-legged essay by arguing that it embodies the complex Chinese cultural and literary tradition."
"As early as the 17th century, the form's adoption was blamed for the decline of classical poetry and prose during the Ming Dynasty. The critic Wu Qiao wrote that ""people exhausted themselves on the eight-legged essay, and poetry was only composed with their spare energy."" Writing at the same time, the political theorist and philosopher Huang Zongxi echoed these sentiments. Also, the essay did not allow for any personal opinion and was completely impartial. As a result, it led to the gradual narrowing of people's innovative thinking and consequently their minds, thus achieving a constraining effect on Chinese people and the nation. The eight-legged essay has been associated with the ""petrification in Chinese literature"" and ""China's cultural stagnation and economic backwardness."""

"The Wright Model B was an early pusher biplane designed by the Wright brothers in the United States in 1910. It was the first of their designs to be built in quantity. Unlike the Model A, it featured a true elevator carried at the tail rather than at the front. It was the last Wright model to have an open-frame tail. The Model B was a dedicated two-seater with the pilot and a passenger sitting side-by-side on the leading edge of the lower wing."
"Besides their civil market, the Wrights were able to sell aircraft to the Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps (S.C. 3, 4, and 5) and to the United States Navy as hydroplanes (AH-4, -5-, and -6), in which services they were used as trainers. Furthermore, the Wrights were able to sell licenses to produce the aircraft domestically (to the Burgess Company and Curtis, which designated it Model F), as well as in Germany. The deal with Burgess was the first license-production of aircraft undertaken in the United States and most of the approximately one hundred Model Bs produced were actually built by Burgess. A modified Model B, redesignated Model EX (for Exhibition) achieved fame as the ""Vin Fiz Flyer"", the first aircraft to cross the United States. Burgess also planned a refined version as the Model G, but this was never built."
At least three original Model Bs were extant in 2007.

"The Breeze is an independent local radio station broadcasting to the Southampton, Portsmouth, Winchester and Four Marks areas of Hampshire, England. It is owned by Nation Broadcasting and is part of The Breeze network of stations (the remainder owned by Bauer Radio). The station has a 'contemporary easy listening' format, playing classic and recent melodic popular music aimed principally at listeners over 40."
"The station operates on three FM frequencies; the three were previously separate stations centred on each of the broadcast areas, which have over time combined into a single regional service. The station is also available online."
"The station launched under its current identity and format on 4 July 2010; it has operated under various owners, formats and identities previously, with the three services having launched independently of each other in 1999 as a series of local stations each focused on a specified broadcast area. All programming is now identical across the three licence areas."
"The Breeze is based at Roman Landing in the Kingsway area of Southampton, sharing facilities with another Nation Broadcasting-owned station in the region, Sam FM."
The 107.8 FM service launched under the name SouthCity FM on 5 September 1999.
"In 2004, the licence was acquired by Southampton Football Club, who renamed the station as The Saint, effectively making it an FM version of their existing club station of the same name (which was broadcasting on digital TV and online). The service was at this point based at studios within Southampton FC's ground, St Mary's Stadium."
"On 26 July 2007, Southampton FC confirmed it had sold the station to South Wales-based radio group Town & Country Broadcasting - a firm headed by lifelong Southampton FC fan Jason Bryant (formerly of Talksport and Virgin Radio). The sale led to a rebranding of the station as 107.8 Radio Hampshire from 6 August 2007. As Radio Hampshire, the station combined adult contemporary music with information and breaking news from Southampton FC; match coverage also continued, and the station continued to be operated from the studio at St. Mary's."
"Radio Hampshire joined Nation Radio, 102.1 Bay Radio, 102.5 Radio Pembrokeshire, 97.1 Radio Carmarthenshire, 97.5 Scarlet FM and 106.3 Bridge FM in the T&CB portfolio."

= = = Birlinn = = =
"The birlinn (spelt ""bìrlinn"" in Scottish Gaelic) was a wooden vessel propelled by sail and oar, used extensively in the Hebrides and West Highlands of Scotland from the Middle Ages on. Variants of the name in English and Lowland Scots include ""berlin"" and ""birling"". The Gallo-Norse term may derive from the Norse ""byrðingr"" (ship of boards). It has been suggested that a local design lineage might also be traceable to vessels similar to the Broighter-type boat (first century BC), equipped with oars and a square sail, without the need to assume a specific Viking design influence. It is uncertain, however, whether the Broighter model represents a wooden vessel or a skin-covered boat of the currach type. The majority of scholars emphasise the Viking influence on the birlinn."
"The birlinn was clinker-built and could be sailed or rowed. It had a single mast with a square sail. Smaller vessels of this type might have had as few as twelve oars, with the larger West Highland galley having as many as forty. For over four hundred years, down to the seventeenth century, the birlinn was the dominant vessel in the Hebrides."
"A 1615 report to the Scottish Privy Council made a distinction between galleys, having between 18 and 20 oars, and birlinns, with between 12 and 18 oars. There was no suggestion of structural differences. The report stated that there were three men per oar."
"The birlinn appears in Scottish heraldry as the ""lymphad"" (a corruption of ""long fhada"" (longship)."
"In terms of design and function, there was considerable similarity between the local birlinn and the ships used by Norse incomers to the Isles. In an island environment ships were essential for the warfare which was endemic in the area, and local lords used the birlinn extensively from at least the thirteenth century. The strongest of the regional naval powers were the Macdonalds of Islay."
"The Lords of the Isles of the Late Middle Ages maintained the largest fleet in the Hebrides. It is possible that vessels of the birlinn type were used in the 1156 sea battle in which Somerled, Lord of Argyll, the ancestor of the lords, firmly established himself in the Hebrides by confronting his brother-in-law, Godred Olafsson, King of the Isles."
"Though the surviving evidence has mostly to do with the birlinn in a naval context, there is independent evidence of mercantile activity for which such shipping would have been essential. There is some evidence for mercantile centres in Islay, Gigha, Kintyre and Knapdale, and in the fourteenth century there was constant trade between the Isles, Ireland and England under the patronage of local lords. Otherwise the chief uses of the birlinn would have been troop-carrying, fishing and cattle transport."
"In some ways the birlinn paralleled the more robust ocean-going craft of Norse design. Viking ships were double-ended, with a keel scarfed to stems fore and aft. A shell of thin planking (strake) was constructed on the basis of the keel, the planks being edge-joined and clenched with iron nails. Symmetrical ribs or frames were then lashed to the strakes or secured with trenails. Over most of the ribs was laid a slender crossbeam and a thwart. The mast was stepped amidships or nearly so, and oars, including a steering oar, were also used. The stem and stern post sometimes had carefully carved notches for plank ends, with knees securing the thwarts to the strakes and beams joining the heads of the frames."
"Oak was the wood favoured both in Western Scotland and in Scandinavia, being tough and resistant to decay. Other types of timber were less often used. It is likely that the Outer Isles of Western Scotland had always been short of timber, but birch, oak and pine abounded in the Inner Isles and on the mainland. The abundance of timber at Lochaber was proverbial: """"B'e sin fiodh a chur do Loch Abar"""" (""Bringing wood to Lochaber"") was said of any superfluous undertaking."
"The tools used are likely to have included adzes, axes, augers and spoon bits, auls, planes, draw knives and moulding irons, together with other tools typical of the Northern European carpenter's kit. As in traditional shipbuilding, generally, measurements were largely by eye."
"The traditional practice of sheltering boats in bank-cuttings (""nausts"") – small artificial harbours – was probably also employed with the birlinn. There is evidence in fortified sites of constructed harbours, boat-landings and sea-gates."
"The influence of Norse shipbuilding techniques, though plausible, is conjectural, since to date no substantial remnants of a birlinn have been found. Traditional boat-building techniques and terms, however, may furnish a guide as to the vessel's construction."
"Carved images of the birlinn from the sixteenth century and earlier show the typical rigging: braces, forestay and backstay, shrouds (fore and aft), halyard and a parrel (a movable loop used to secure a yard or gaff to a mast). There is a rudder with pintles on the leading edge, inserted into gudgeons. It is possible that use was made of a wooden bowline or reaching spar (called a ""beitass"" by the Norse). This was used to push the luff of the sail out into the wind."
"Traditional Highland practice was to make sails of tough, thick-threaded wool, with ropes being made of moss-fir or heather. Medieval sails, in the Highlands as elsewhere, are shown as being sewn out of many small squares, and there is possible evidence of reef points."
"A reproduction of a 16 oar Highland galley, the ""Aileach"", was built in 1991 at Moville in Donegal. It was based on representations of such vessels in West Highland sculpture. Despite the good seagoing performance of the vessel, its design has been described as misleading because of an over-reliance in the plan on cramped sculptural images. The vessel was designed with a high, almost vertical, stern and stem. It proved difficult to fit in more than one rower per oar and the thwarts were too close together. Less constricted images from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries show vessels which are longer and larger."
"The birlinn had a significant symbolic and thematic place in Gaelic literature. Examples can be found in the songs of Màiri nighean Alasdair Ruaidh (Mary MacLeod) (c.1615 – c.1705), an important poet in the Hebridean lordship of the MacLeods. In a lament she describes a ship wrecked by storm, with the wind ripping the sail in a way that defied the strength of the crew:"
"In another song a ship is described as setting forth from ""Dunvegan of the harps"": may the crew (says the poet), from the mast-heads aloft to the halyards below, keep it close to the wind that takes it across the straits:"
= = = Dot book = = =
"A dot book (also dotbook or dot-book or drill book) is a small notebook utilized by marching bands (especially high school show bands and drum corps) in order to aid the learning of formations on a field. The dot book was invented by Leslie Allard, a prominent high school band instructor and all-star percussionist. The name is derived from the use of dots on drill sheets which symbolize players on the field: a dot book focuses on the owner's particular dots and other marchers the player may have to guide (use to determine an adjusted location)."
"The general layout of a dot book contains the ""longitudes"" and ""latitudes"" of an American football field. However, a cartesian coordinate system (x/y) is rarely used, rather an alternative system of plotting players as dots on a grid and some jargon is used. For instance, a player may write: ""3 inside 45R and 5 in front BH."" This would mean that the player is 3 steps inside (towards the 50 yard line) from the 45th yard line from the right side (facing the press box) and is five steps in front of the back hash (see Field and players of American football for an explanation of terms)."
"Many times, however, a person's own dot book will contain their own specialized shorthand to represent their location on the field. Dot books can vary from simple (providing only the location of the marcher) to complex (also providing the location of nearby marchers whom you are guiding). This poses problems when players are switched between positions on the field: switching dot books is often difficult and many times players end up rewriting their dot books."
"Dot books are considered essential by many high school band instructors to the progress of drill. Severe penalties can be incurred for forgetting or losing one's dot book. Dot books also become irreplaceable as a season moves on: whenever drill is changed or a visual is added, the dot book becomes the sole record of this change. Loss of a dot book can result in the need for the band to readjust something that had been handled several months prior."
"This is a sample page of a pack of drill sheets. The owner of this page is AS10, and their dot on the field has been circled accordingly. After looking at this page, AS10 wrote in their page on the dot book at the top of this article. Several notable features:"
"An alternative to the dot book is the coordinate sheet. Like dot books, coordinate sheets are small and meant to be worn around the neck on a lanyard. Coordinate sheets are set up as a list of the member's places on the field, given in coordinates (such as 5 steps inside the right 45 yard line and 2.25 steps in front of the Home hash), each ""set"" numbered. Also on the sheet is the number of steps it takes to go from one set to another, but this isn't written plainly. Set 1 always has a ""0"" by it. If it should take sixteen counts to move to the next set, a ""16"" will be placed next to Set 2's coordinates. If it should take eight counts to move to the third set, a ""24"" is next to Set 3's coordinates."
= = = Paul DePodesta = = =
"Paul DePodesta (born December 16, 1972) is an American football executive and former baseball executive who is the chief strategy officer for the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL). He previously served as a front-office assistant for the Cleveland Indians, Oakland Athletics, and New York Mets. DePodesta was also general manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers. The year after leading the Dodgers to their first playoff win in 16 years, he was fired after the 2005 club finished with its worst record in 11 years. He was the ninth general manager in the club's history since its move to Los Angeles. He is also known for his appearance in the book and movie ""Moneyball"" about his time with the Athletics."
"DePodesta is a native of Alexandria, Virginia, where he grew up with Thad Levine. He attended Episcopal High School ('91) and then Harvard University, where he played baseball and football and graduated in 1995 with a degree in economics. He has worked for the Baltimore Stallions of the Canadian Football League and the Baltimore Bandits of the American Hockey League."
"In 1996, DePodesta got his first baseball job with the Cleveland Indians, where he spent three seasons. He served as an advance scout for two years and in his final month with the club was appointed special assistant to general manager John Hart."
"In 1999, he joined the Oakland Athletics organization as an assistant to general manager Billy Beane. DePodesta was a key figure in Michael Lewis's book ""Moneyball"". The book thrust the analytical principles of sabermetrics into the mainstream."
"At the age of 31, DePodesta was named general manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers on February 16, 2004, making him the fifth-youngest general manager in baseball history, behind Jon Daniels (28) of the Texas Rangers, Theo Epstein (28) of the Boston Red Sox, Andrew Friedman (28) of the Tampa Bay Rays, and Randy Smith (29) of the San Diego Padres."
"DePodesta's reliance on sabermetric principles has been somewhat controversial. He is often considered part of a new breed of front-office executives whose personnel decisions depend heavily on analysis of performance data, often at the perceived expense of more traditional methods of scouting and observation."
"One of DePodesta's most notable moves was made at the 2004 trading deadline. He traded catcher Paul Lo Duca, relief pitcher Guillermo Mota and outfielder Juan Encarnación to the Florida Marlins in exchange for pitcher Brad Penny, first baseman Hee Seop Choi and pitcher Bill Murphy, in what was reportedly an attempt to pick up pieces to acquire pitcher Randy Johnson from the Arizona Diamondbacks. DePodesta was heavily criticized in the local and national baseball media for this trade, because Lo Duca was thought to be the ""heart and soul"" of the team. The Dodgers made the playoffs anyway, with Penny developing into one of the better pitchers in the National League during his stint with the Dodgers, which lasted until the end of the 2008 season. Choi, however, was a disappointment, batting just .161 in 2004 and .253 in 2005, and striking out 80 times in 320 at bats. Bill Murphy was traded that year to acquire Steve Finley, who hit 13 homers in 58 games, including a memorable grand slam that clinched the division title. Lo Duca played through 2005 with the Marlins and then went to the New York Mets, the Washington Nationals and back to the Marlins, making his final Major League appearance in September 2008."
"During the 2004 off-season, Adrián Beltré, who had hit 48 home runs in 2004, signed with Seattle as a free agent, spurning DePodesta's offer of 3 years for $30 million for Seattle's offer of 5 years for $64 million. DePodesta signed J. D. Drew, Jeff Kent, and Derek Lowe. Drew enjoyed two productive seasons as a Dodger and then used an opt-out clause in his contract to sign a new 5-year deal with the Boston Red Sox. Both Kent and Lowe put in four productive seasons for the Dodgers and cut ties with the franchise at the end of the 2008 season with Kent retiring and Lowe signing a contract with the Atlanta Braves."
"Coming off the successes of 2004, the 2005 season saw the Dodgers lose a number of players to significant stints on the disabled list. Many of the players lost to injury were expected to produce heavily for the team, including J. D. Drew, Milton Bradley, Éric Gagné, Jayson Werth, César Izturis and Odalis Pérez. The 2005 season resulted in the team's worst record since 1992 and second worst since moving to Los Angeles in 1958. On October 29, 2005, Dodgers owner Frank McCourt fired DePodesta, citing his desire to see the club win and that DePodesta had not met those expectations. Reports surfaced that the real reason McCourt had fired DePodesta was his inability to find satisfactory managerial candidates to replace Jim Tracy. He was later replaced by Ned Colletti, who hired Grady Little as manager. Some have speculated that McCourt fired DePodesta in response to media criticism from ""Los Angeles Times"" sports columnists T.J. Simers and Bill Plaschke, who were vehemently ""anti-Moneyball"" and referred to DePodesta pejoratively as ""Google Boy."""
"On June 30, 2006, DePodesta was hired as the Special Assistant for Baseball Operations for the San Diego Padres and was promoted to Executive Vice President on November 10, 2008."
"On November 8, 2010, DePodesta was hired as the vice president of player development and scouting for the New York Mets by general manager Sandy Alderson, with whom DePodesta worked when Alderson was CEO of the Padres."
"On January 5, 2016, DePodesta was hired by the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL) as their chief strategy officer."
"In 2003, author Michael Lewis was interested in how Oakland Athletics general manager (GM) Billy Beane tried to find quality players to improve the team while struggling with one of the smallest payrolls in Major League Baseball. He first wanted to write an article on the subject, but the idea eventually blossomed into a book named """". Lewis's interests included how Beane hired DePodesta as his assistant to incorporate sabermetrics, an approach that consists of more sophisticated analyses of baseball statistics, which is at least partially credited for their 2002 20-game winning streak which set an American League record."
"Lewis's book examines the lives and careers of various baseball personalities and explains the art of sabermetrics. Bill James, who coined the term sabermetrics for the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR), is also a major focus. James published ""The Bill James Baseball Abstract"" from 1977 to 1988 and wrote several sabermetrics books. Beane and DePodesta had studied James's work and were inspired by his knowledge of baseball analysis."
"DePodesta did not feel comfortable in the spotlight after the book's release, nor did he care for the secrets revealed about his scouting methods. The book earned DePodesta a reputation as a cold calculator, choosing players based only on their numbers. In addition, he was thought of as a guy who knew nothing of ""real baseball."""
"In reality, DePodesta played football in college and wanted to be a football coach, seen in a photo wearing number 17. After graduating from Harvard with a degree in economics, he became an intern for the Canadian Football League's Baltimore Stallions in 1995. In early 1996, he got his first baseball job with the Cleveland Indians, where he worked as a scout. In October 1996, at age 24, he was promoted to the position of advance scout. In October 1998, he became assistant to the General Manager for the team. Those experiences led to him being hired by Beane as his assistant with the Oakland A's in November 1998."
"When the movie ""Moneyball"" was adapted from the book, DePodesta did not approve of the way his character was portrayed. ""There were a handful of things. Some were factual, others were more ephemeral."" He had no objection to Jonah Hill's performance. ""Jonah was awesome. He was so respectful of me and my time. It would have been flattering to be portrayed by someone of his expertise. It had nothing to do with the casting,"" DePodesta said in 2010. ""I just could never get comfortable with the idea of somebody else portraying me to the rest of the world. Like any movie, to make it interesting, there has to be some conflict there. In some respects, a lot of the conflict is going to revolve around my character, and that was never really the case in reality,"" he said in 2011. He also talked about the caricatural focus it brought on him, first in 2003 and again in 2011. ""The other problem was I wasn't all that interested in the attention. It had already happened from the book. And I didn't necessarily need to relive it."""
"The role was originally going to be given DePodesta's name and portrayed by Demetri Martin, but DePodesta did not want his name or likeness to be used in the movie, so the character was named Peter Brand. Brand is a composite of Beane's assistants in Oakland, not an accurate representation of any specific person. But ""Moneyball""s director, Bennett Miller, has credited DePodesta for being generous and helpful in the making of the film. Hill was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance."
"DePodesta is married to artist and philanthropist Karen Deicas and has three sons and a daughter. In 2016, Deicas launched the Sports Mind Institute, which seeks to connect lessons learned from figures in professional sports, athletes, team executives, and coaches, to help others apply them to life and the business sector. The family resides in the La Jolla neighborhood of San Diego, California."
"On December 13, 2012, DePodesta was elected to the Board of Directors of Sears Holdings Corporation. He has also served as a keynote speaker at numerous business conventions and been recognized by several publications, including ""Baseball Prospectus"" and ""Fortune Magazine"", which named him one of the Top 10 innovators under the age of 40."

= = = Spanish–American War Nurses Memorial = = =
"The Spanish–American War Nurses Memorial is a memorial in Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia, in the United States that commemorates those American nurses who died in the Spanish–American War in 1898. The rough-hewn, grey granite memorial was erected by the Order of Spanish–American War Nurses on May 2, 1905. It stands in the southwestern corner of Section 21, where the first Spanish–American War nurses are buried."
"The memorial should not be confused with the Nurses Memorial. This tall marble figure of a nurse in a nurse's uniform and cape was erected in 1938. It also stands in Section 21, a short distance away. It is screened from the northern part of Section 21 by a copse of trees."
"The Spanish–American War was a ten-week conflict that occurred in the spring and summer of 1898. Cuba had been waging a war of independence against Spain since 1895, an effort largely supported by the United States (which had extensive economic interests on the island). To ensure the safety of American citizens and property in Cuba, the United States sent the battleship to Havana in late January 1898. The ""Maine"" exploded and was destroyed with large loss of life on February 15. American newspapers whipped up war fever, and held Spain responsible for the ship's destruction. The United States Congress enacted a joint resolution demanding independence for Cuba, and President William McKinley signed it into law on April 20. In response, Spain severed diplomatic relations on April 21. The same day, the United States Navy began a blockade of Cuba. Spain declared war on April 23. On April 25, Congress declared that a state of war between the U.S. and Spain had existed since April 21."
"The Spanish–American War began on April 25, 1898, and ended on August 12, 1898. Cuban and Spanish dead vastly outnumbered American deaths. While 2,910 American military personnel died during the war, just 345 were combat deaths. The rest died of disease. The U.S. military barred women from serving in any capacity prior to the war. Although the Army had 791 nurses, they were all male, and far too few to provide the medical care needed. Soldiers resisted being transferred from combat units into the nursing corps, and few volunteers signed up for medical duty. Congress quickly authorized the military to hire female nurses—but on contract, not as military personnel. The army reached out specifically to the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR), a patriotic society, to recruit women nurses. Dr. Anita Newcomb McGee, one of the medical doctors practicing in the United States, was asked to lead the DAR's recruitment effort. Of the 1,563 nurses recruited for the new Nurse Corps, most served in hospitals in the United States. Only 76 were sent to Cuba, 30 to the Philippines, nine to Puerto Rico, six to Honolulu, and eight served aboard the hospital ship . It was the first time in American history where nurses were fully accepted in military hospitals."
"Although no nurses were killed in combat, 140 died of typhoid and 13 from other diseases. (One of the 13 died of yellow fever after being experimented upon by the army.) Since nearly all the nurses died in the United States, most were sent home to their families for burial. A handful died overseas, and were buried there. On July 8, 1898, Congress enacted legislation authorizing the repatriation of American dead, and appropriating funds for this purpose. Additional legislation was enacted on February 9, 1900; May 26, 1900; and June 6, 1900. Many of the dead were buried at Arlington National Cemetery, either because their families desired it or the remains could not be identified."
"The first Spanish–American War nurse to be buried at Arlington National Cemetery was Anna H. Campos, who died in Cuba on September 2, 1899. Her remains were repatriated about May 1900. By February 1901, the military had repatriated a few of the bodies of nurses who had died overseas. For families which wished it, or where remains went unclaimed or unidentified, the bodies were buried at Arlington. These nurses were buried in what is now Section 21. Over time, more military nurses were buried next to them, creating a ""nurses' section"". The U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps had control of Arlington National Cemetery at the time. In late 1906, Brigadier General Charles F. Humphrey, Sr., Quartermaster General, gave permission for any Army nurse who wished to be buried at Arlington National Cemetery with military honors."
"In June 1899, Dr. Anita Newcomb McGee co-founded the Order of Spanish–American War Nurses to (among other things) commemorate the service of contract nurses during the Spanish–American War and serve as an advocate for nurses within the U.S. military. At the founding convention on August 7, 1899, Order members agreed to sponsor a $10,000 ""Nurses' Monument"" ($ in dollars) to military nurses at Arlington National Cemetery. Order dues were 25 cents ($ in dollars), and the organization proposed that any dues money left over after the organization's expenses were paid should go toward the monument. By October 1, an additional $158.75 ($ in dollars) in contributions had been raised."
"Approval for the memorial was not quickly forthcoming. A memorial committee was established by the Order of Spanish War Nurses, chaired by Miss Esther Hasson of New York. But by November 1901, the Secretary of War Elihu Root had not yet given approval for the memorial. Fundraising, too, was going slowly, and only $265.63 ($ in dollars) was in the order's memorial fund. The order received word that the Army had set aside a site near the western corner of what is now Section 21 for the memorial in late 1902. But this decision was not a formal one. In the late summer of 1903, however, Dr. McGee received assurance from Secretary of War Root and Quartermaster General Humphrey that the order could erect a memorial in Section 21. However, General Humphrey requested that order erect a simple, artistic monument rather than anything elaborate."
"At the order's annual meeting on August 22, 1903, the Order of Spanish–American War Nurses debated the nature of the memorial they wished to erect. The original intent of the order was to honor all trained nurses, untrained ""immune"" nurses, Catholic sisters, male contract nurses, and any enlisted hospital corpsmen buried in the section. But none of these were actually buried at Arlington in the section assigned for the memorial. In fact, by July 1903, only two immune nurses and two soldiers were buried in Section 21. President McGee said members had expressed their disinclination to commemorate all nurses from all wars buried at Arlington, and the order was barred from erecting a memorial to itself. McGee proposed that the memorial honor all female nurses from the Spanish–American War (whom she called ""our comrades""), or just trained female nurses. She asked the delegates to consider the issue, and make an explicit choice when it voted the following day."
"Later that day, the Committee on Monument issued its report to the membership Committee chair Esther Hasson noted that several designs had been submitted, including one from Tiffany & Co. (although the process for requesting designs was not reported in the media). The cost of the more elaborate memorials was in the $3,000 range ($ in dollars). However, Hasson said, Quartermaster General Humphreys had indicated in July 1903 that the Army's preference was for a simple stone memorial with an inscription, a design which would cost less than $1,000 ($ in dollars). The committee noted that this eliminated any memorial incorporating a bronze tablet, bas-relief figures, or elaborate carving. The committee noted that its preference was for a simple monument approximate in size and cost to that suggested by the Army. The Monument committee submitted a resolution proposing that the monument fund be raised to $3,000 ($ in dollars); that a committee of three be appointed by the chair to produce a monument acceptable to the committee and the Secretary of War as quickly as possible; and that this monument be dedicated to ""deceased army nurses in the National Cemetery at Arlington, Virginia"". The motion passed. The chair immediately appointed Miss Amanda J. Armistead, Miss Isabelle J. Walton, Miss Edith H. Rutley to the Special Committee on Monument."
"On August 23, the Special Committee on Monument made a verbal report to the order (the contents of which were not revealed in the media), which was followed by vigorous discussion. But the members voted to delay action until next annual meeting in September 1904."
"By November 1903, the memorial fund stood at only $346.66 ($ in dollars)."
"The 1904 annual meeting of the Order of Spanish–American War Nurses was scheduled for early September at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, Missouri. However, at the request of Dr. McGee, the meeting was postponed until November 7, 1904 (although the meeting location was not altered). When the order met in St. Louis, the membership voted unanimous to erect a nurses' memorial with all due speed. But no design for the monument was chosen. The total cost of the memorial was also not reported, but Dr. McGee requested that each member donate $2 ($ in dollars) to bring monument fund to amount needed. By November 1, 1904, just $187 ($ in dollars) had been raised, bringing the monument fund to $546.84 ($ in dollars)."
"By mid-December 1904, the Special Monument Committee of the Order of Spanish–American War Nurses had yet to choose a design, even though many members favored the figure of a nurse."
"Time began to press on the Order of Spanish–American War Nurses. More than six years had elapsed since the monument was first proposed, and donations were only trickling in. Eighteen months had passed since the Secretary of War gave his consent to erect a monument, and there seemed little reason to believe that more time would allow the order to construct a grander memorial. In early 1905, the order contracted with Barclay Bros., a granite company in Barre, Vermont, to produce the memorial."
"The dedication for the Spanish–American War Nurses Memorial was set for 3:00 P.M. on May 2, 1905. The Order of Spanish–American War Nurses established a dedication committee to plan the memorial's unveiling. The committee had great difficulty in getting speakers to commit to the ceremony, and in setting a program. They were successful, however, in persuading Colonel Charles P. Morton, commander of the 7th Cavalry at Fort Myer, to provide a military band."
"The dedication ceremony was not elaborate, but it was symbolic. A temporary pole made of bamboo from the Philippines was erected next to the memorial, and palm branches from Cuba and Puerto Rico were bunched about its base. At the top of the pole was a laurel wreath festooned with red, white, and blue ribbons. Around the foot of the monument, more palm branches were spread. An honor guard of 25 veterans from the Washington, D.C., chapter of the Spanish War Veterans stood around the memorial."
"Dignitaries at the event included Dr. Anita Newcomb McGee (who presided over the ceremony); M. Emmett Urell, Colonel, USA (ret.), past commander of the Grand Army of the Republic; Dr. Clifford Cox, commander, Spanish–American War Veterans; Mrs. Emily N.R. McClean, president, Daughters of the American Revolution; surviving Civil War nurses from Washington, D.C. (all members of the National Association of Army Nurses of the Civil War); Colonel Morton and several U.S. Army and U.S. Navy officers; and a representative from the Embassy of Japan. A marquee was erected near the memorial site to shelter them."
"The dedication ceremony was simple. Father Thomas McGuigan of St. Patrick's Catholic Church provided an invocation. Dr. McGee spoke briefly, followed by Dr. Cox. A poem by Rudyard Kipling was read, and then 15-year-old Klotho McGee (Dr. McGee's daughter) unveiled the monument as the 7th Cavalry Band played ""The Star-Spangled Banner"". Mrs. McLean delivered a lengthy address as the highlight of the ceremony. An Army chaplain gave a benediction, and a bugler from Fort Myer played ""Taps""."
"The Spanish–American War Nurses Memorial is located along the southwestern edge of Section 21 in Arlington National Cemetery. Porter Avenue runs southeast-to-northwest in front of the memorial, while Lawton Avenue is a short distance to the north. Porter and Lawton Avenues meet McPherson Avenue near where the memorial lies. The Battle of the Bulge Memorial is a few feet away to the northwest."
"Aziz Kelmendi (; born 15 January 1967 in Lipljan, SFR Yugoslavia) was a Kosovo Albanian conscript in the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA). Yugoslav authorities described him as a ""misfit and loner"". Prior to his military service, he was arrested and imprisoned from 2–17 April 1984 for allegedly attempting to leave Yugoslavia and go to Albania. At his trial hearing he reportedly said ""Albania is my country, not Yugoslavia. I want to go there and live and fight for our goals!"". His conviction included also for nationalistic behaviour at high school and university. He disliked learning Serbo-Croatian. Prior to the killings, he had two arguments with a soldier named Safet Dudaković."
"On 3 September 1987, Kelmendi's mother and father came to Paraćin to visit their son. That morning, Kelmendi broke into a firearm cabinet and stole ten 7.62 mm bullets. He loaded these into his military-issued automatic weapon and went from the living facilities to a guard post. According to the JNA inquiry, Kelmendi threatened to kill the watchman, corporal Riza Alibašić, and took two rounds of ammunition from him. Pointing his weapon at Alibašić, Kelmendi took the corporal back to the living facility and demanded to know where Dudaković slept. When Alibašić refused to answer, Kelmendi told him to step aside and went into the sleeping quarters. There, he shot and killed the sleeping Dudaković before killing Srđan Simić and Goran Begić and wounding two other soldiers. He went into the adjacent sleeping quarters and fired randomly at the soldiers there, killing Hasim Dženanović and wounding two others. Kelmendi then fled the barracks. He was found dead away and his death was later declared a suicide. A total of four soldiers were killed and five were wounded in the shooting. Two of those killed were Bosniaks, one was a Serb, and one was half-Slovene and half-Croat."
"It was claimed that ""Keljmendi was assisted by eight associates, members of a hostile Albanian separatist and irredentist group"". These eight, six ethnic Albanians, a Muslim and a Roma, were later convicted for helping the attack. Yugoslav authorities concluded that Kelmendi had planned the attack shortly before it occurred. They stated that the military unit in which he served had no reason to suspect that he was mentally unstable and that he was ""a loner who had a personal complex because he was ugly and quite nervous"". He apparently socialized only with other Albanians and sometimes acted aggressively."
"The Paraćin massacre shocked Yugoslavia, where mass shootings were very uncommon. Media reported the attack as a ""shot at Yugoslavia"". It prompted Yugoslav authorities to send 400 federal police officers to Kosovo at the end of 1987. Despite those killed having been mostly non-Serbs, the Serbian media presented the shootings as an anti-Serbian attack. An estimated 10,000 people attended the funeral of Srđan Simić, the Serb soldier who was killed. Senior JNA officers and the mayor of Belgrade were in attendance. The crowd followed Simić's casket in silence, with some complaining that neither Ivan Stambolić nor Slobodan Milošević had attended the funeral. Afterwards, crowds began denouncing Yugoslavia and chanting ""Serbia, Serbia!"". They shouted ""better the grave than a slave!"", ""we want freedom"", ""Kosovo is Serbia"", ""we shall not give Kosovo away"" and ""enough of resolutions"". Simić's father repeatedly asked for the crowd to stop chanting, but to no avail. After the funeral, an estimated 20,000 people visited Aleksandar Ranković's grave in the same cemetery and sang ""Hey, Slavs"", the national anthem of Yugoslavia. The crowd shouted ""down with Azem Vllasi"" and ""all Shiptars out of Serbia, Kosovo is ours!""."
"Mobs responded to the killings by destroying Albanian-owned kiosks and shops in Paraćin, Subotica, and Valjevo. Yugoslav authorities arrested Kelmendi's family members and questioned them in a Prizren jail. Kelmendi's sixteen-year-old sister, Melihata, was expelled from her school. The Partisan organization in Kelmendi's birthplace, Dušanovo, demanded that all villagers isolate his family. Kelmendi's high school tutor, Agish Kastrati, was forced from the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and five of his teachers received ""final warnings"" for failing to record Kelmendi's absence from school during his imprisonment three years earlier."

"The Nissan GTP ZX-Turbo (also known as the GTP ZX-T) was a series of racing cars developed for Nissan Motors by Electramotive Engineering to compete in the IMSA GT Championship. Running from 1985 to 1990, they were known for being the first car to defeat the Porsche 962 which had dominated IMSA's premiere GTP category. This led to Nissan winning the constructor's championship and 12 Hours of Sebring in 1989 and 1990. During 1990, the GTP ZX-Turbo were replaced by the newer NPT-90."
"The GTP ZX-Turbo was named due to its shared engine with the production Nissan 300ZX, the turbocharged VG30ET V6. Although the engine block was similar, the GTP ZX-Turbo's engine was extensively modified to cope with the stress of racing."
"In 1984, Nissan Motors named Electramotive Engineering as their official North American racing development arm in an attempt to establish Nissan in the United States following the use of the Datsun name. Nissan wished to use the IMSA GT Championship as a way of showcasing their technology, similar to what they had done at the 24 Hours of Le Mans beginning in 1983. Electramotive would be tasked with maintaining, modifying, and racing the cars. Nissan would provide the VG30ET motors, although Electramotive would aid in developing the engine for racing. For the chassis, Nissan and Electramotive would turn to Lola Cars International to construct their new car to their specifications."
"The first two chassis, (#1 and #2), termed ""Lola T810"", were completed in early 1985. This initial year of competition was used for development of the new car in preparation for 1986. Electramotive was tasked with modifying elements of the T810 to better adapt to the smaller tracks and shorter sprint races used by IMSA GT. This led to the cars being renamed GTP ZX-Turbos as their design was evolved beyond the initial T810."
"One more T810 chassis, (#3) would be constructed by Lola, sold to Japan but then sent to, and adapted by Electramotive by the end of 1987. Some of these cars actually shared their tub off of an earlier Lola design, the T710, better known as the Chevrolet Corvette GTP. However, modifications to the cars would eventually extend to the point that Electramotive would begin to construct their own chassis to replace the older cars, no longer relying on Lola for the cockpit tubs. A total of five Electramotive-built tubs were completed in 1988. Electramotive later became Nissan Performance Technology Inc. (NPTI) in 1990, finally retiring the GTP ZX-Turbos once the new NPT-90s were completed halfway through the season."
"The first Lola T810 would be completed soon after the 1985 season had begun, with that initial chassis making its competition debut at Laguna Seca. Electramotive founder Don Devendorf and co-driver Tony Adamowicz took the car to eleventh place, seven laps down from the race winner. Following a heavy accident in practice at Charlotte, the car would not return until late in the season. The car had a ninth-place finish at Sears Point before mechanical problems did not allow the car to finish any of the remaining races that season."
"Nissan choose to skip several rounds of the 1986 season in order to concentrate on development, including the 24 Hours of Daytona and 12 Hours of Sebring. The newly named GTP ZX-Turbo made its season debut in the streets of Miami, but this was followed by a string of problems in the future rounds. The car would eventually be able to finish at Mid-Ohio with a career best of seventh, but Electramotive would be able to improve on this with the car showing its first true potential of the season, fighting with the leaders at Portland and eventually coming home in third with Geoff Brabham at the helm. This would be immediately followed at the next round with a fourth-place finish. The success would not last though, as mechanical problems would render the car unable to finish for several rounds. The final race of the season in the streets of Columbus would see a distant fifth place, earning Nissan seventh in the constructor's championship with their points total."
"Once again deciding to skip the longer rounds of the IMSA season, the GTP ZX-Turbo debuted at Miami once again. However, lessons learned from the previous season as well as testing during the winter had allowed Electramotive to greatly improve the car. This earned the GTP ZX-Turbo its maiden win at Miami, defeating a Porsche 962 by eleven seconds after three hours of racing. Nissan's success would be short lived though as the next rounds at Road Atlanta and Riverside would see the car failing to finish due to clutch failure and an accident respectively. Electramotive would be able to overcome these problems at Laguna Seca with a fifth, before problems returned at Mid-Ohio."
"Electramotive would be unable to find much success until the final round of the season at Del Mar, with the GTP ZX-Turbo closing the season with a sixth-place finish. Although Nissan managed to take an improved fifth in the constructor's championship, they still earned only a sixth of the total points that champion Porsche had."
"Following their first ever victory, the Nissan program was expanded greatly in 1988 with plans for a two car team, although this would be delayed due to accidents in practice with the second car. Starting with a disappointing eighth at Miami, the GTP ZX-Turbo would begin its streak of successes that would help the car become a threat to the top teams. Beginning at their next race at Road Atlanta, the car defeated the factory Jaguar team by a mere four seconds. Unlike previous years, this success would continue as another victory was taken at the next round at the streets of Palm Beach, then Lime Rock Park, Mid-Ohio, Watkins Glen, and Road America. This success was mostly due to a technology developed in the turbocharger which allowed it an advantage over the naturally aspirated engines used in other prototypes."
"The second car for the team was finally able to compete at Portland, and in a dominant performance the two cars swept the top spots. Although the next round would see one car finish in eighth, the other team car would manage to yet again take the race win. Only at the street race in San Antonio would the GTP ZX-Turbo's eight race win streak come to an end, with the lone entered car suffering electrical problems. The cars would return to winning form at Columbus, before the final round saw Nissan being defeated once again, with Derek Daly managing to bring one of the team cars home with a best of only fourth."
"Although Nissan managed to win nine of the fourteen rounds that the GTP class competed in that season, the decision by Electramotive to skip the 24 Hours of Daytona and 12 Hours of Sebring hurt Nissan's ability to win the constructor's championship. With only three wins, Porsche's points earned at the races Nissan missed allowed them to win the championship by a mere point. However, as consolation, Nissan's Geoff Brabham would win the drivers championship by a large margin."
"Wishing to overcome their narrow defeat in 1988, Electramotive and Nissan would fight hard to win the elusive championship in 1989. Nissan wisely chose to participate in the 24 Hours of Daytona and 12 Hours of Sebring, even though the reliability of the cars was in question. Indeed, Nissan's fears were realized when neither car managed to finish at Daytona, although one did last the bulk of the race. At the shorter Miami round, the GTP ZX-Turbo would return to its winning form from the previous season, once again defeating Jaguar. However, at the 12 Hours of Sebring, the GTP ZX-Turbo would score a surprise result, with Chip Robinson, Geoff Brabham, and Arie Luyendyk taking the race victory by two laps."
"With the car's endurance proven, the car took victory at Road Atlanta. Although problems took away victory on the streets of Palm Beach, the cars began a winning streak once again, taking victories at Lime Rock, Mid-Ohio, Mosport, and Road America. The team had to settle for second and third at Portland as Jaguar's new car began to show its pace. However the GTP ZX-Turbos were back at Topeka with the top two positions, beginning another short streak through San Antonio and Sears Point. Defeat came once again at Tampa, while the cars would also not be able to win the season finale at Del Mar."
"With ten victories in comparison to Jaguar's three, Nissan was able to easily win the constructor's championship, the first time anyone besides Porsche had won it since the GTP class had been created in 1983. Geoff Brabham edged out Chip Robinson for his second drivers championship."
"As the defending champions, Nissan realized that the aged GTP ZX-Turbo was now the prime target of all other competitors, leading them to begin development on the car's replacement. While this car was being built, Nissan would have to continue to use the older GTP ZX-Turbos into the 1990 season. The newly renamed NPTI team would be aided by privateer Busby Racing who ran a third car that season."
"Following problems once again at Daytona, the GTP ZX-Turbos would take a victory in Miami for the third time, while Busby's new car would take second. The team would also improve on their performance at Sebring by not only taking the race win, but also second for the other team car. The streak would continue through Road Atlanta and Palm Beach before the newcomer Eagle-Toyota would overcome Nissan at Topeka."
"The Topeka race would also see the debut of the GTP ZX-Turbo's replacement, the NPT-90, with the team running one car of each. Lime Rock would also see Nissan defeated, yet Mid-Ohio would have the company back on top. This time though it would be the NPT-90 defeating the GTP ZX-Turbo as the two took the top spots. Following a result of fifth behind the NPT-90's first, the GTP ZX-Turbo would be retired completely. By the next round, the second NPT-90 would be completed and replace the sole remaining GTP ZX-Turbo used by the team."
"With the combined running of the GTP ZX-Turbos and NPT-90s, as well as the performance of privateers Jim Busby and later David Seabroke, Nissan would once again easily take the GTP constructors championship. Geoff Brabham would take his third drivers championship as well. One GTP ZX-Turbo would be entered by John Shapiro at the Miami round in 1991, finishing 13th before the team would fold. This would be the final race by a GTP ZX-Turbo car, although the NPT-90s would continue to carry the GTP ZX-Turbo name on them."
"One of the first three Lola T810s built would be sold to the Le Mans Company in Japan for use in the All Japan Sports Prototype Championship. Debuting late in the 1985 season, the car would suffer mechanical failures before finishing eighth at the 1000 km of Fuji to close out the season. The following season, the car would continue to have problems, again only finishing at the 1000 km of Fuji. This time however the car managed sixth place, 13 laps behind the winning Porsche 962. The car would be retired as the team moved on to a Porsche."
"Following the retirement of the GTP ZX-Turbo in 1990, one of the former works chassis would be taken to Europe to participate in the Interserie championship in 1991. Although quick, the car would struggle to complete races. This would lead to it being quickly abandoned."
"Debuting at a time when Nissan was phasing out the Datsun brand in the United States, the GTP ZX-Turbo was used by the company to promote their ability to produce sporty, advanced cars. This led to the GTP ZX-Turbos being used in television and print advertisements for the whole Nissan brand, but also specifically the 300ZX with which it shared its engine."
"The GTP ZX-Turbos were featured as part of a ""Miami Vice"" episode revolving around the IMSA GT Miami Grand Prix, although this was primarily using footage of the race itself."
"The 1990 slotless racing game ""GT Super Screamers"" by Worlds of Wonder uses Nissan GTP ZX-Turbos."
"Mayweather's trunks were designed by Dapper Dan, a Harlem-based hip-hop fashion designer. At least five possible outfits were created for the fight. FanDuel, a daily fantasy sports website, acquired sponsorship rights to have their logo appear on his waistband. Pacquiao's gear was provided by Nike."
"Mayweather commissioned specially-designed mouthguards for the fight by Dr. Lee Gause, owner of Iceberg Guards, costing $25,000. Along with ""subtle"" clear pairs, some of them contained gold leaf, diamond dust and an embedded $100 bill. Iceberg Guards also released a limited-edition TMT-branded mouthguard to tie in with the fight. Pacquiao's mouthguard was designed by Dr. Ed Dela Vega of Canoga Park, Los Angeles, who has custom-fit mouthguards for Pacquiao and other Philippine boxers. It featured a multi-colored design with a blend of the colors from the flag of the Philippines, meant to represent the different ethnic groups that support him. Unlike Mayweather's, this mouthguard was supplied as a gift to Pacquiao; Vega argued that Mayweather's high-cost mouthguard was simply ""hype"" meant to ""rub it in the face of boxers who can't afford it""."
"A bidding war ensued between Corona and Tecate—which had respectively served as prominent sponsors of previous Mayweather and Pacquiao fights—for lead sponsorship rights to the fight. Tecate won the sponsorship deal with a bid of $5.6 million, beating a bid of $5.2 million by Corona. As part of the deal, Tecate's logo was visible on all promotional material for the fight. Pacquiao was expected to feature a number of major sponsorships on his gear, providing an estimated $2.25 million in additional revenue. Among them were long-time sponsors, such as Air Asia, Cafe Puro and Motolite. Daily fantasy sports service FanDuel acquired sponsorship rights for Mayweather, including waistband branding and a block of tickets that were given away through an on-site sweepstakes. The King, a mascot of fast food chain Burger King, was among Mayweather's entourage entering the arena."
"Prior to the fight, Nike launched a line of Pacquiao-oriented merchandise carrying his logo and the slogans ""Do What They Say You Can't"" and ""#MannyDoes"". Demand for Mayweather merchandise was also heavy, including apparel branded under the Mayweather Promotions and The Money Team (TMT) labels amongst others."
"From April 24, 2015, through the day of the fight, a MayPac pop-up store operated on the corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Fremont Street. It sold merchandise for both fighters and featured interactive displays and fan-oriented events."
"In round one, both boxers were aggressive, Mayweather unusually so. Pacquiao attempted to score early points from body shots. However, Mayweather escaped his attack and landed a solid counter strike under Pacquiao's right side. All three judges gave the round to Mayweather. In the second round, Pacquiao repeatedly forced Mayweather toward the ropes, but Mayweather was able to escape or wrap Pacquiao up each time. Pacquiao's jabs mostly missed, but he landed a solid left hand hit late in the round. Mayweather increased his aggression late. Although Harold Lederman of HBO scored this round for Pacquiao, all three judges scored the round in favor of Mayweather."
"Early in round three, Mayweather hit Pacquiao low. Pacquiao reacted angrily to the hit, perceiving it as illegal. The fighters exchanged big hits late in the round, energizing the crowd. For the third consecutive round, all three judges scored it in favor of Mayweather. In the fourth round, Pacquiao chased Mayweather around the ring, throwing punches at a rapid pace. Pacquiao scored a big left handed hit, causing Mayweather to put his high guard up against the ropes. Pacquiao took the round on all three scorecards."
"Having recovered from Pacquiao's big hit in the previous round, Mayweather won the early exchanges of the fifth round. Pacquiao remained on the offensive, but was unable to land any big punches. Mayweather upped his activity and won the round in the eyes of the three judges. Pacquiao came out aggressive in the sixth, forcing Mayweather to the ropes. Pacquiao successfully landed a couple of combinations, but Mayweather appeared to be unfazed. All the judges gave the round to Pacquiao, making the overall score Mayweather 58–56 (4–2 by rounds) on all cards."
"Mayweather changed tactics at the start of the seventh round, becoming the aggressor for a second and forcing Pacquiao on to the ropes. He threw a double jab, then a right-handed punch, landing none, before Pacquiao counterattacked with an unsuccessful combo. Mayweather stayed aggressive in the eighth round, landing jabs that kept Pacquiao off balance. Pacquiao went on the attack, opening up and landing some bigger punches. The round went to Mayweather on the official scorecards."
"In the ninth round, Pacquiao was again on the offensive. He effectively landed several punches, but Mayweather also landed on his counters. Both parties landed a number of hits in a late flurry of action that excited the crowd. Pacquiao was active, while Floyd picked his counters. Two of the three judges gave the round to Pacquiao, while the other saw it for Mayweather. The tenth round saw Pacquiao on the attack. Again, two judges saw it for Pacquiao and one for Mayweather. Mayweather led 96–94 (6–4) on two cards and 98–92 (8–2) on the other with two rounds remaining."
"Mayweather came out swinging in the eleventh round, landing just below his highest volume of the fight. The action then stalled as Pacquiao struggled to land much on a defensive-minded Mayweather, who ducked the attacks. Pacquiao forced Mayweather to the corner, but Mayweather landed a clean hit on Pacquiao's chin. However, Pacquiao still managed to hit solid punches in a fast pace. The judges unanimously scored the round in favor of Mayweather. In the final round, Pacquiao attempted to attack with Mayweather mostly looking to avoid his punches by running across the ring. Mayweather kept the fight in the center of the ring, but Pacquiao did land some inside counters. All three judges gave the round to Mayweather."
"Floyd Mayweather Jr. defeated Manny Pacquiao after 12 rounds by unanimous decision, 118–110, 116–112, 116–112, to remain undefeated in his career. According to CompuBox, Mayweather landed 67 more punches throughout the match. Only three times did Pacquiao land double figure punches in a round. Pacquiao himself thought he won the fight and continues to maintain that he deserved the decision."
"The fight lived up to revenue expectations, generating somewhere between $300 million and $400 million in gross revenue according to early estimates (including announced ticket sales totalling $72,198,500), which would surpass Super Bowl XLIX. Due to the possibility of high demand, viewers were encouraged to pre-order the PPV: a HBO representative reported that the fight had attracted more pre-orders than any other PPV event in the broadcaster's history. Despite the guidance, a high volume of last-minute orders overwhelmed the systems of several major U.S. television providers and resulted in various technical issues, such as difficulties ordering or viewing the PPV and outages that affected unrelated channels as well for some viewers. To address these issues, the main event was pushed back 45 minutes from its originally projected start time of 8:15 p.m. PT (11:15 p.m. ET), to 9:00 p.m PT (12:00 a.m. ET)."
"The fight broke PPV viewership records in the United States, with 4.6 million buys and over $410 million in revenue, surpassing the previous $150 million revenue record set by Floyd Mayweather vs. Canelo Álvarez, the 2.48 million buy record set by 2007's Oscar De La Hoya vs. Floyd Mayweather Jr. and a pre-fight estimate of $270 million from three million households. In the Philippines, Kantar ratings estimated that the fight was watched across the three-network consortium by 46.9% of Filipino households; of the three networks simulcasting the fight, ABS-CBN had the largest number of viewers, with a rating share of 24%."
"Due to hundreds of business jets filling up the stands, McCarran International Airport was closed for non-airline flights during the event days. By contrast, the typically bustling streets of the Philippine capital Manila were nearly empty during the fight."
"After the fight, Mayweather remarked ""[Pacquiao] definitely had his moments in the fight. As long as I moved on the outside, I was able to stay away from those. He’s a really smart fighter ... My dad wanted me to do more, but I had to take my time. Because Manny Pacquiao is a competitor, and he’s extremely dangerous."" Mayweather said he would retire after his next fight, the opponent of which is not yet decided. Pacquiao said ""I thought I won the fight. He’s moving around. It’s not easy to throw punches when he’s moving around so much ... I thought I caught him many more times than he caught me."" Citing the stats that showed he possibly should have won the fight, Pacquiao has continued to maintain he should have been awarded the decision. On the possibility of a rematch, Mayweather stated on May 9, 2015, that he had no plans to fight Pacquiao again ""at this particular time"", referring to him as being a ""sore loser"" and a ""coward""."
"Hours after the fight, Pacquiao's team disclosed that he had injured his right shoulder in April during a training exercise. The injury was partially healed, but Pacquiao requested and was denied an injection of legal painkillers before the fight. Pacquiao said he re-injured the shoulder in the fourth round of the fight and was ineffective after that. On May 4, a representative of the Nevada State Athletic Commission said that it was looking into why Pacquiao had stated he had no shoulder injuries on pre-fight questionnaire and was considering fining or suspending him for the deception. Pacquiao's team responded with a statement saying the United States Anti-Doping Agency had been informed of the injury, but USADA head Travis Tygart said Pacquiao's team had only asked about the legality of certain substances for use on an unspecified shoulder injury and had provided ""no medical information, no MRIs, no documents"". Mayweather initially stated that he would be open to the possibility of a rematch with Pacquiao once he had recovered from his shoulder injury, but he changed his mind before talks of a rematch were in the works. Pacquiao later underwent surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff and was out of action for nine months to one year."
"After weighing in for the fight on May 1, Mayweather received an intravenous injection for the stated purpose of pre-bout re-hydration. The two IV infusions were administered at his home, amounted to 16% of the total average male blood quantity, and contained saline, multivitamins and vitamin C. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) forbids such a large amount of fluids entering the body before competition as a preventive step against the possible masking of performance-enhancing drug use. Bob Bennett, the executive director of the NSAC, stated that unless the IV was administered at a hospital, it needs to be cleared by filing a therapeutic-use exemption, and supporting documents through the Nevada commission and authorized by the commission’s medical expert. The Pacquiao camp had requested an injection of the anti-inflammatory Toradol for Pacquiao's injured shoulder before the fight, but was denied authorization by the NSAC. USADA authorized both injections, but the NSAC was not informed of Mayweather's IV until after the fight."
"The fight itself left many fans disappointed. Forbes.com contributor Brian Goff called it ""arguably, the least entertaining 'mega fight' in memory"", attributing the disappointment to Mayweather's defense-oriented strategy, which is atypical of top boxers. ""The New York Times"" felt that the bout was ""far from electrifying and had some fans grumbling about Mayweather’s methodical defensive style"". ""Los Angeles Times"" columnist Bill Dwyre felt that the fight was ""as compelling as the 405 freeway at 8 a.m."". Regarding Pacquiao's undisclosed shoulder injury, he called the entire situation very damaging to boxing, accusing the fight's promoters of allowing the fight to go on for monetary reasons, and potentially alienating fans. Dwyre went on to say that ""This was billed the Fight of the Century. As ""The Wall Street Journal"" so aptly put it, it's good that we have 85 years left to top it."" Former heavyweight champ Evander Holyfield, who thought that Pacquiao should have been awarded the decision, questioned the judging of not just this fight but recent prize fights in general in an essay in ""The Players' Tribune""."
"On May 5, 2015, two Las Vegas residents filed a class-action lawsuit against Pacquiao, his manager and Top Rank, for failing to disclose Pacquiao's injury before the fight. The plaintiffs felt that their actions deceived those who bought tickets or the PPV or bet on the fight and violated the rules of the NSAC. The complaints will be heard by a Los Angeles judge, who will determine whether they may go to trial."
"In May 2016, Showtime Networks also sued Top Rank over the injury, claiming that the promoter violated an indemnification agreement."
"On September 15, 2018, both Mayweather and Pacquiao posted videos on Instagram depicting an encounter between the two at Ultra Japan, speculating the possibility of a rematch. Mayweather's stated in his posting of the video that the fight would happen ""this year"" and described it as ""another nine-figure pay day on the way"" and was heard remarking to Pacquiao that he was going to ""take [the belt] from you like I did before"". In Pacquiao's video (posted with the comment ""50–1 #NoExcuses""), Mayweather was heard mentioning the ""second of December"". It is unknown if any formal negotiations have actually occurred."
"On September 19, 2018, Mayweather clarified his calls for a rematch, stating that he planned to hold a fight in Japan first before any possible rematch."
"On November 4, 2018, it was announced that Mayweather would fight undefeated Japanese kickboxer Tenshin Nasukawa on New Year's Eve. It will be a three-round exhibition boxing match. In the one-sided fight, Nasukawa was knocked down three times in the first round and his corner subsequently threw the towel in."
